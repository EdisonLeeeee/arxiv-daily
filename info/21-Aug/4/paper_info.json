    "abstract": "Given a reference object of an unknown type in an image, human observers can\neffortlessly find the objects of the same category in another image and\nprecisely tell their visual boundaries. Such visual cognition capability of\nhumans seems absent from the current research spectrum of computer vision.\nExisting segmentation networks, for example, rely on a humongous amount of\nlabeled data, which is laborious and costly to collect and annotate; besides,\nthe performance of segmentation networks tend to downgrade as the number of the\ncategory increases. In this paper, we introduce a novel Reference semantic\nsegmentation Network (Ref-Net) to conduct visual boundary knowledge\ntranslation. Ref-Net contains a Reference Segmentation Module (RSM) and a\nBoundary Knowledge Translation Module (BKTM). Inspired by the human recognition\nmechanism, RSM is devised only to segment the same category objects based on\nthe features of the reference objects. BKTM, on the other hand, introduces two\nboundary discriminator branches to conduct inner and outer boundary\nsegmentation of the target objectin an adversarial manner, and translate the\nannotated boundary knowledge of open-source datasets into the segmentation\nnetwork. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with tens of finely-grained\nannotated samples as guidance, Ref-Net achieves results on par with fully\nsupervised methods on six datasets.",

    "abstract": "Learning-based methods are increasingly popular for search algorithms in\nsingle-criterion optimization problems. In contrast, for multiple-criteria\noptimization there are significantly fewer approaches despite the existence of\nnumerous applications. Constrained path-planning for Autonomous Ground Vehicles\n(AGV) is one such application, where an AGV is typically deployed in disaster\nrelief or search and rescue applications in off-road environments. The agent\ncan be faced with the following dilemma : optimize a source-destination path\naccording to a known criterion and an uncertain criterion under operational\nconstraints. The known criterion is associated to the cost of the path,\nrepresenting the distance. The uncertain criterion represents the feasibility\nof driving through the path without requiring human intervention. It depends on\nvarious external parameters such as the physics of the vehicle, the state of\nthe explored terrains or weather conditions. In this work, we leverage\nknowledge acquired through offline simulations by training a neural network\nmodel to predict the uncertain criterion. We integrate this model inside a\npath-planner which can solve problems online. Finally, we conduct experiments\non realistic AGV scenarios which illustrate that the proposed framework\nrequires human intervention less frequently, trading for a limited increase in\nthe path distance.",

    "abstract": "There has been a recent surge of interest in designing Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) for semi-supervised learning tasks. Unfortunately this work has assumed\nthat the nodes labeled for use in training were selected uniformly at random\n(i.e. are an IID sample). However in many real world scenarios gathering labels\nfor graph nodes is both expensive and inherently biased -- so this assumption\ncan not be met. GNNs can suffer poor generalization when this occurs, by\noverfitting to superfluous regularities present in the training data. In this\nwork we present a method, Shift-Robust GNN (SR-GNN), designed to account for\ndistributional differences between biased training data and the graph's true\ninference distribution. SR-GNN adapts GNN models for the presence of\ndistributional shifts between the nodes which have had labels provided for\ntraining and the rest of the dataset. We illustrate the effectiveness of SR-GNN\nin a variety of experiments with biased training datasets on common GNN\nbenchmark datasets for semi-supervised learning, where we see that SR-GNN\noutperforms other GNN baselines by accuracy, eliminating at least (~40%) of the\nnegative effects introduced by biased training data. On the largest dataset we\nconsider, ogb-arxiv, we observe an 2% absolute improvement over the baseline\nand reduce 30% of the negative effects.",

In this paper, we propose a new method called Batch\nNormalization Preconditioning (BNP). Instead of applying normalization\nexplicitly through a batch normalization layer as is done in BN, BNP applies\nnormalization by conditioning the parameter gradients directly during training.\nThis is designed to improve the Hessian matrix of the loss function and hence\nconvergence during training. One benefit is that BNP is not constrained on the\nmini-batch size and works in the online learning setting.

    "abstract": "Connected vehicles (CVs), because of the external connectivity with other CVs\nand connected infrastructure, are vulnerable to cyberattacks that can instantly\ncompromise the safety of the vehicle itself and other connected vehicles and\nroadway infrastructure. One such cyberattack is the false information attack,\nwhere an external attacker injects inaccurate information into the connected\nvehicles and eventually can cause catastrophic consequences by compromising\nsafety-critical applications like the forward collision warning. The occurrence\nand target of such attack events can be very dynamic, making real-time and\nnear-real-time detection challenging. Change point models, can be used for\nreal-time anomaly detection caused by the false information attack. In this\npaper, we have evaluated three change point-based statistical models;\nExpectation Maximization, Cumulative Summation, and Bayesian Online Change\nPoint Algorithms for cyberattack detection in the CV data. Also, data-driven\nartificial intelligence (AI) models, which can be used to detect known and\nunknown underlying patterns in the dataset, have the potential of detecting a\nreal-time anomaly in the CV data. We have used six AI models to detect false\ninformation attacks and compared the performance for detecting the attacks with\nour developed change point models. Our study shows that change points models\nperformed better in real-time false information attack detection compared to\nthe performance of the AI models. Change point models having the advantage of\nno training requirements can be a feasible and computationally efficient\nalternative to AI models for false information attack detection in connected\nvehicles.",

The recent emergence of cloud-based quantum computing\ninfrastructure and innovations in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices have\nrevealed a new era of quantum-enhanced algorithms that can be leveraged to\nimprove real-time incident detection accuracy. In this research, a hybrid\nmachine learning model, which includes classical and quantum machine learning\n(ML) models, is developed to identify incidents using the connected vehicle\n(CV) data. The incident detection performance of the hybrid model is evaluated\nagainst baseline classical ML models. The framework is evaluated using data\nfrom a microsimulation tool for different incident scenarios. The results\nindicate that a hybrid neural network containing a 4-qubit quantum layer\noutperforms all other baseline models when there is a lack of training data. We\nhave created three datasets; DS-1 with sufficient training data, and DS-2 and\nDS-3 with insufficient training data. The hybrid model achieves a recall of\n98.9%, 98.3%, and 96.6% for DS-1, DS-2, and DS-3, respectively. For DS-2 and\nDS-3, the average improvement in F2-score (measures model's performance to\ncorrectly identify incidents) achieved by the hybrid model is 1.9% and 7.8%,\nrespectively, compared to the classical models.

    "abstract": "Soft spelling errors are a class of spelling mistakes that is widespread\namong native Arabic speakers and foreign learners alike. Some of these errors\nare typographical in nature. They occur due to orthographic variations of some\nArabic letters and the complex rules that dictate their correct usage. Many\npeople forgo these rules, and given the identical phonetic sounds, they often\nconfuse such letters. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term\nmemory network that corrects this class of errors. We develop, train, evaluate,\nand compare a set of BiLSTM networks. We approach the spelling correction\nproblem at the character level. We handle Arabic texts from both classical and\nmodern standard Arabic. We treat the problem as a one-to-one sequence\ntranscription problem. Since the soft Arabic errors class encompasses omission\nand addition mistakes, to preserve the one-to-one sequence transcription, we\npropose a simple low-resource yet effective technique that maintains the\none-to-one sequencing and avoids using a costly encoder-decoder architecture.\nWe train the BiLSTM models to correct the spelling mistakes using transformed\ninput and stochastic error injection approaches. We recommend a configuration\nthat has two BiLSTM layers, uses the dropout regularization, and is trained\nusing the latter training approach with error injection rate of 40%. The best\nmodel corrects 96.4% of the injected errors and achieves a low character error\nrate of 1.28% on a real test set of soft spelling mistakes.",

    "abstract": "Reusing code snippets shared by other programmers on Q&A forums (e.g.,\nStackOverflow) is a common practice followed by software developers. However,\nlack of sufficient information about the fully qualified name (FQN) of\nidentifiers in borrowed code snippets, results in serious compile errors.\nProgrammers either have to manually search for the correct FQN of identifiers\nwhich is a tedious and error-prone process, or use tools developed to\nautomatically identify correct FQNs. Despite the efforts made by researchers to\nautomatically identify FQNs in code snippets, the current approaches suffer\nfrom low accuracy when it comes to practice. Moreover, while these tools focus\non resolving the FQN for an identifier in a code snippet, they leave the\nchallenge of finding the correct third-party library (i.e., dependency)\nimplementing that FQN unresolved. Using an incorrect dependency or incorrect\nversion of a dependency might lead to a semantic error which is not detectable\nby compilers. Therefore, it can result in serious damages in the run-time.\nIn this paper, we introduce DepRes, a tool that leverages a sketch-based\napproach to resolve FQNs in java-based code snippets and recommend the correct\ndependency for each FQN. The source code, documentation, as well as a demo\nvideo of DepRes tool is available from its code repository at\nhttps://github.com/SoftwareDesignLab/DepRes-Tool.",

    "abstract": "We present a method to estimate depth of a dynamic scene, containing\narbitrary moving objects, from an ordinary video captured with a moving camera.\nWe seek a geometrically and temporally consistent solution to this\nunderconstrained problem: the depth predictions of corresponding points across\nframes should induce plausible, smooth motion in 3D. We formulate this\nobjective in a new test-time training framework where a depth-prediction CNN is\ntrained in tandem with an auxiliary scene-flow prediction MLP over the entire\ninput video. By recursively unrolling the scene-flow prediction MLP over\nvarying time steps, we compute both short-range scene flow to impose local\nsmooth motion priors directly in 3D, and long-range scene flow to impose\nmulti-view consistency constraints with wide baselines. We demonstrate accurate\nand temporally coherent results on a variety of challenging videos containing\ndiverse moving objects (pets, people, cars), as well as camera motion. Our\ndepth maps give rise to a number of depth-and-motion aware video editing\neffects such as object and lighting insertion.",

    "abstract": "Representations are crucial for a robot to learn effective navigation\npolicies. Recent work has shown that mid-level perceptual abstractions, such as\ndepth estimates or 2D semantic segmentation, lead to more effective policies\nwhen provided as observations in place of raw sensor data (e.g., RGB images).\nHowever, such policies must still learn latent three-dimensional scene\nproperties from mid-level abstractions. In contrast, high-level, hierarchical\nrepresentations such as 3D scene graphs explicitly provide a scene's geometry,\ntopology, and semantics, making them compelling representations for navigation.\nIn this work, we present a reinforcement learning framework that leverages\nhigh-level hierarchical representations to learn navigation policies. Towards\nthis goal, we propose a graph neural network architecture and show how to embed\na 3D scene graph into an agent-centric feature space, which enables the robot\nto learn policies for low-level action in an end-to-end manner. For each node\nin the scene graph, our method uses features that capture occupancy and\nsemantic content, while explicitly retaining memory of the robot trajectory. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method against commonly used visuomotor\npolicies in a challenging object search task. These experiments and supporting\nablation studies show that our method leads to more effective object search\nbehaviors, exhibits improved long-term memory, and successfully leverages\nhierarchical information to guide its navigation objectives.",

    "abstract": "In tracking radar, the sensing environment often varies significantly over a\ntrack duration due to the target's trajectory and dynamic interference.\nAdapting the radar's waveform using partial information about the state of the\nscene has been shown to provide performance benefits in many practical\nscenarios. Moreover, radar measurements generally exhibit strong temporal\ncorrelation, allowing memory-based learning algorithms to effectively learn\nwaveform selection strategies. This work examines a radar system which builds a\ncompressed model of the radar-environment interface in the form of a\ncontext-tree. The radar uses this context tree-based model to select waveforms\nin a signal-dependent target channel, which may respond adversarially to the\nradar's strategy. This approach is guaranteed to asymptotically converge to the\naverage-cost optimal policy for any stationary target channel that can be\nrepresented as a Markov process of order U < $\\infty$, where the constant U is\nunknown to the radar.

    "abstract": "The compression of deep learning models is of fundamental importance in\ndeploying such models to edge devices. Incorporating hardware model and\napplication constraints during compression maximizes the benefits but makes it\nspecifically designed for one case. Therefore, the compression needs to be\nautomated. Searching for the optimal compression method parameters is\nconsidered an optimization problem. This article introduces a Multi-Objective\nHardware-Aware Quantization (MOHAQ) method, which considers both hardware\nefficiency and inference error as objectives for mixed-precision quantization.\nThe proposed method makes the evaluation of candidate solutions in a large\nsearch space feasible by relying on two steps. First, post-training\nquantization is applied for fast solution evaluation. Second, we propose a\nsearch technique named \"beacon-based search\" to retrain selected solutions only\nin the search space and use them as beacons to know the effect of retraining on\nother solutions. To evaluate the optimization potential, we chose a speech\nrecognition model using the TIMIT dataset. The model is based on Simple\nRecurrent Unit (SRU) due to its considerable speedup over other recurrent\nunits. We applied our method to run on two platforms: SiLago and Bitfusion.\nExperimental evaluations showed that SRU can be compressed up to 8x by\npost-training quantization without any significant increase in the error and up\nto 12x with only a 1.5 percentage point increase in error. On SiLago, the\ninference-only search found solutions that achieve 80\\% and 64\\% of the maximum\npossible speedup and energy saving, respectively, with a 0.5 percentage point\nincrease in the error. On Bitfusion, with a constraint of a small SRAM size,\nbeacon-based search reduced the error gain of inference-only search by 4\npercentage points and increased the possible reached speedup to be 47x compared\nto the Bitfusion baseline.",

However, DWM's benefits cannot address data access latency and\nthroughput limitations of memory bus bandwidth. We propose PIRM, a DWM-based\nin-memory computing solution that leverages the properties of DWM nanowires and\nallows them to serve as polymorphic gates. While normally DWM is accessed by\napplying spin polarized currents orthogonal to the nanowire at access points to\nread individual bits, transverse access along the DWM nanowire allows the\ndifferentiation of the aggregate resistance of multiple bits in the nanowire,\nakin to a multilevel cell. PIRM leverages this transverse reading to directly\nprovide bulk-bitwise logic of multiple adjacent operands in the nanowire,\nsimultaneously. Based on this in-memory logic, PIRM provides a technique to\nconduct multi-operand addition and two operand multiplication using transverse\naccess. PIRM provides a 1.6x speedup compared to the leading DRAM PIM technique\nfor query applications that leverage bulk bitwise operations. Compared to the\nleading PIM technique for DWM, PIRM improves performance by 6.9x, 2.3x and\nenergy by 5.5x, 3.4x for 8-bit addition and multiplication, respectively.

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved excellent audio\nsynthesis quality in the last years. However, making them operable with\nsemantically meaningful controls remains an open challenge. An obvious approach\nis to control the GAN by conditioning it on metadata contained in audio\ndatasets. Unfortunately, audio datasets often lack the desired annotations,\nespecially in the musical domain. A way to circumvent this lack of annotations\nis to generate them, for example, with an automatic audio-tagging system. The\noutput probabilities of such systems (so-called \"soft labels\") carry rich\ninformation about the characteristics of the respective audios and can be used\nto distill the knowledge from a teacher model into a student model. In this\nwork, we perform knowledge distillation from a large audio tagging system into\nan adversarial audio synthesizer that we call DarkGAN. Results show that\nDarkGAN can synthesize musical audio with acceptable quality and exhibits\nmoderate attribute control even with out-of-distribution input conditioning. We\nrelease the code and provide audio examples on the accompanying website.",

In response to this challenge, we present OVERT: a sound algorithm\nfor safety verification of nonlinear discrete-time closed loop dynamical\nsystems with neural network control policies. The novelty of OVERT lies in\ncombining ideas from the classical formal methods literature with ideas from\nthe newer neural network verification literature. The central concept of OVERT\nis to abstract nonlinear functions with a set of optimally tight piecewise\nlinear bounds. Such piecewise linear bounds are designed for seamless\nintegration into ReLU neural network verification tools. OVERT can be used to\nprove bounded-time safety properties by either computing reachable sets or\nsolving feasibility queries directly. We demonstrate various examples of safety\nverification for several classical benchmark examples. OVERT compares favorably\nto existing methods both in computation time and in tightness of the reachable\nset.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated the viability of using crowdsourcing as a tool\nfor evaluating the truthfulness of public statements. Under certain conditions\nsuch as: (1) having a balanced set of workers with different backgrounds and\ncognitive abilities; (2) using an adequate set of mechanisms to control the\nquality of the collected data; and (3) using a coarse grained assessment scale,\nthe crowd can provide reliable identification of fake news. However, fake news\nare a subtle matter: statements can be just biased (\"cherrypicked\"), imprecise,\nwrong, etc. and the unidimensional truth scale used in existing work cannot\naccount for such differences. In this paper we propose a multidimensional\nnotion of truthfulness and we ask the crowd workers to assess seven different\ndimensions of truthfulness selected based on existing literature: Correctness,\nNeutrality, Comprehensibility, Precision, Completeness, Speaker's\nTrustworthiness, and Informativeness. We deploy a set of quality control\nmechanisms to ensure that the thousands of assessments collected on 180\npublicly available fact-checked statements distributed over two datasets are of\nadequate quality, including a custom search engine used by the crowd workers to\nfind web pages supporting their truthfulness assessments. A comprehensive\nanalysis of crowdsourced judgments shows that: (1) the crowdsourced assessments\nare reliable when compared to an expert-provided gold standard; (2) the\nproposed dimensions of truthfulness capture independent pieces of information;\n(3) the crowdsourcing task can be easily learned by the workers; and (4) the\nresulting assessments provide a useful basis for a more complete estimation of\nstatement truthfulness.",

    "abstract": "We study a new challenging problem of efficient deployment for diverse tasks\nwith different resources, where the resource constraint and task of interest\ncorresponding to a group of classes are dynamically specified at testing time.\nPrevious NAS approaches seek to design architectures for all classes\nsimultaneously, which may not be optimal for some individual tasks. A\nstraightforward solution is to search an architecture from scratch for each\ndeployment scenario, which however is computation-intensive and impractical. To\naddress this, we present a novel and general framework, called Elastic\nArchitecture Search (EAS), permitting instant specializations at runtime for\ndiverse tasks with various resource constraints. To this end, we first propose\nto effectively train the over-parameterized network via a task dropout strategy\nto disentangle the tasks during training. In this way, the resulting model is\nrobust to the subsequent task dropping at inference time. Based on the\nwell-trained over-parameterized network, we then propose an efficient\narchitecture generator to obtain optimal architectures within a single forward\npass. Experiments on two image classification datasets show that EAS is able to\nfind more compact networks with better performance while remarkably being\norders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art NAS methods. For example, our\nproposed EAS finds compact architectures within 0.1 second for 50 deployment\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "In object-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), 6D object poses\noffer a compact representation of landmark geometry useful for downstream\nplanning and manipulation tasks. However, measurement ambiguity then arises as\nobjects may possess complete or partial object shape symmetries (e.g., due to\nocclusion), making it difficult or impossible to generate a single consistent\nobject pose estimate. One idea is to generate multiple pose candidates to\ncounteract measurement ambiguity. In this paper, we develop a novel approach\nthat enables an object-based SLAM system to reason about multiple pose\nhypotheses for an object, and synthesize this locally ambiguous information\ninto a globally consistent robot and landmark pose estimation formulation. In\nparticular, we (1) present a learned pose estimation network that provides\nmultiple hypotheses about the 6D pose of an object; (2) by treating the output\nof our network as components of a mixture model, we incorporate pose\npredictions into a SLAM system, which, over successive observations, recovers a\nglobally consistent set of robot and object (landmark) pose estimates. We\nevaluate our approach on the popular YCB-Video Dataset and a simulated video\nfeaturing YCB objects. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective\nin improving the robustness of object-based SLAM in the face of object pose\nambiguity.",

Our approach uses a restricted class of temporal logic formulas to\nrepresent the likely intentions of the agents along with a combination of\ntemporal logic-based optimal cost path planning and Bayesian inference to\ncompute the probability of these intents given the current trajectory of the\nrobot. First, we construct a large but finite hypothesis space of possible\nintents represented as temporal logic formulas whose atomic propositions are\nderived from a detailed map of the robot's workspace. Next, our approach uses\nreal-time observations of the robot's position to update a distribution over\ntemporal logic formulae that represent its likely intent. This is performed by\nusing a combination of optimal cost path planning and a Boltzmann noisy\nrationality model. In this manner, we construct a Bayesian approach to\nevaluating the posterior probability of various hypotheses given the observed\nstates and actions of the robot. Finally, we predict the future position of the\nrobot by drawing posterior predictive samples using a Monte-Carlo method. We\nevaluate our framework using two different trajectory datasets that contain\nmultiple scenarios implementing various tasks.

We\nmodel this problem by examining how humans position objects given multiple\nfeatures received from vision and haptic modalities. However, organizational\nhabits vary greatly between people both in structure and adherence. To deal\nwith user organizational preferences, we add an additional modality,\n''utility'' ($U$), which informs on a particular human's perceived usefulness\nof a given object. Models were trained as generalized (over many different\npeople) or tailored (per person). We use two types of models: random forests,\nwhich focus on precise multi-task classification, and Markov logic networks,\nwhich provide an easily interpretable insight into organizational habits. The\nmodels were applied to both synthetic data, which proved to be learnable when\nusing fixed organizational constraints, and human-study data, on which the\nrandom forest achieved over 90% accuracy. Over all combinations of $\\{H, U,\nV\\}$ modalities, $UV$ and $HUV$ were the most informative for organization.

However, due to the tremendous growth\nin multilingual content, there is a great demand to build models and systems\nthat support multilingual information access. To this end, we propose a dataset\nfor Multimodal Multiparty Hindi Humor (M2H2) recognition in conversations\ncontaining 6,191 utterances from 13 episodes of a very popular TV series\n\"Shrimaan Shrimati Phir Se\". Each utterance is annotated with humor/non-humor\nlabels and encompasses acoustic, visual, and textual modalities. We propose\nseveral strong multimodal baselines and show the importance of contextual and\nmultimodal information for humor recognition in conversations. The empirical\nresults on M2H2 dataset demonstrate that multimodal information complements\nunimodal information for humor recognition.

    "abstract": "We present an end-to-end online motion planning framework that uses a\ndata-driven approach to navigate a heterogeneous robot team towards a global\ngoal while avoiding obstacles in uncertain environments. First, we use\nstochastic model predictive control (SMPC) to calculate control inputs that\nsatisfy robot dynamics, and consider uncertainty during obstacle avoidance with\nchance constraints. Second, recurrent neural networks are used to provide a\nquick estimate of future state uncertainty considered in the SMPC finite-time\nhorizon solution, which are trained on uncertainty outputs of various\nsimultaneous localization and mapping algorithms. When two or more robots are\nin communication range, these uncertainties are then updated using a\ndistributed Kalman filtering approach. Lastly, a Deep Q-learning agent is\nemployed to serve as a high-level path planner, providing the SMPC with target\npositions that move the robots towards a desired global goal. Our complete\nmethods are demonstrated on a ground and aerial robot simultaneously (code\navailable at: https://github.com/AlexS28/SABER).",

    "abstract": "Click-through rate prediction is one of the core tasks in commercial\nrecommender systems. It aims to predict the probability of a user clicking a\nparticular item given user and item features. As feature interactions bring in\nnon-linearity, they are widely adopted to improve the performance of CTR\nprediction models. Therefore, effectively modelling feature interactions has\nattracted much attention in both the research and industry field. The current\napproaches can generally be categorized into three classes: (1) na\\\"ive\nmethods, which do not model feature interactions and only use original\nfeatures; (2) memorized methods, which memorize feature interactions by\nexplicitly viewing them as new features and assigning trainable embeddings; (3)\nfactorized methods, which learn latent vectors for original features and\nimplicitly model feature interactions through factorization functions. Studies\nhave shown that modelling feature interactions by one of these methods alone\nare suboptimal due to the unique characteristics of different feature\ninteractions. To address this issue, we first propose a general framework\ncalled OptInter which finds the most suitable modelling method for each feature\ninteraction. Different state-of-the-art deep CTR models can be viewed as\ninstances of OptInter. To realize the functionality of OptInter, we also\nintroduce a learning algorithm that automatically searches for the optimal\nmodelling method. We conduct extensive experiments on four large datasets. Our\nexperiments show that OptInter improves the best performed state-of-the-art\nbaseline deep CTR models by up to 2.21%. Compared to the memorized method,\nwhich also outperforms baselines, we reduce up to 91% parameters. In addition,\nwe conduct several ablation studies to investigate the influence of different\ncomponents of OptInter. Finally, we provide interpretable discussions on the\nresults of OptInter.",

    "abstract": "This paper outlines an exact and a heuristic algorithm for the electric\nvehicle routing problem with a nonlinear charging function (E-VRP-NL)\nintroduced by Montoya et al. (2017). The E-VRP-NL captures several realistic\nfeatures of electric vehicles including the battery limited driving range and\nnonlinear charging process at the charging stations. We formulate this problem\nas a set-partitioning and solve it using a column generation based algorithm.\nThe resulting pricing problem of the column generation is a complicated problem\nas, next to the usual operational constraints e.g. time windows and vehicle\ncapacity, electric vehicle related features are also considered. In particular,\nthe nonlinear nature of the battery charging process requires the incorporation\nof a set of sophisticated recursive functions in the pricing algorithm. We show\nhow these recursive functions allow for the simultaneous evaluation of the\nrouting and charging decisions. Moreover, we illustrate how they can\nefficiently be embedded in the pricing algorithm. The column generation\nalgorithm is integrated in a branch and bound algorithm and cutting planes are\nadded resulting in a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm for the E-VRP-NL. Next\nto the exact algorithm, we also develop a tabu search based heuristic to solve\nthe problem quickly. To prove the efficiency of the proposed algorithms, their\nperformance is tested on benchmark instances from the literature. Our exact\nalgorithm can optimally solve instances with up to 40 customers, including\nseveral instances previously unsolved to optimality. The tabu search heuristic\nproves to be superior to state-of-the-art heuristics in the literature both on\nsolution quality and computation times.",

MBDP\nconsists of two kinds of dropout mechanisms, where the rollout-dropout aims to\nimprove the robustness with a small cost of sample efficiency, while the\nmodel-dropout is designed to compensate for the lost efficiency at a slight\nexpense of robustness. By combining them in a complementary way, MBDP provides\na flexible control mechanism to meet different demands of robustness and\nefficiency by tuning two corresponding dropout ratios. The effectiveness of\nMBDP is demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally.",

    "abstract": "We focus on tackling weakly supervised semantic segmentation with\nscribble-level annotation. The regularized loss has been proven to be an\neffective solution for this task. However, most existing regularized losses\nonly leverage static shallow features (color, spatial information) to compute\nthe regularized kernel, which limits its final performance since such static\nshallow features fail to describe pair-wise pixel relationship in complicated\ncases. In this paper, we propose a new regularized loss which utilizes both\nshallow and deep features that are dynamically updated in order to aggregate\nsufficient information to represent the relationship of different pixels.\nMoreover, in order to provide accurate deep features, we adopt vision\ntransformer as the backbone and design a feature consistency head to train the\npair-wise feature relationship. Unlike most approaches that adopt multi-stage\ntraining strategy with many bells and whistles, our approach can be directly\ntrained in an end-to-end manner, in which the feature consistency head and our\nregularized loss can benefit from each other.

In this paper, we propose to synthesize brain-network-inspired\ninterconnections for large-scale network-on-chips.

In addition, given the large-scale applications and the\nmodular topology, we present an application mapping method, including task\nmapping and deterministic deadlock-free routing, to minimize the power\nconsumption and hop count. Finally, a cycle-accurate simulator BookSim2 is used\nto validate the architecture performance with different synthetic traffic\npatterns and large-scale test cases, including real-world communication\nnetworks for the graph processing application. Experiments show that, compared\nwith other topologies and methods, the NoC design generated by the proposed\nmethod presents significantly lower average hop count and lower average\nlatency.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a joint input and state dynamic estimation scheme for\npower networks in microgrids and active distribution systems with unknown\ninputs. The conventional dynamic state estimation of power networks in the\ntransmission system relies on the forecasting methods to obtain the\nstate-transition model of state variables. However, under highly dynamic\nconditions in the operation of microgrids and active distribution networks,\nthis approach may become ineffective as the forecasting accuracy is not\nguaranteed. To overcome such drawbacks, this paper employs the power networks\nmodel derived from the physical equations of branch currents. Specifically, the\npower network model is a linear state-space model, in which the state vector\nconsists of branch currents, and the input vector consists of bus voltages. To\nestimate both state and input variables, we propose linear Kalman-based dynamic\nfiltering algorithms in batch-mode regression form, considering the\ncross-correlation between states and inputs. For the scalability of the\nproposed scheme, the distributed implementation is also presented.\nComplementarily, the predicted state and input vectors are leveraged for bad\ndata detection. Results carried out on a 13-bus microgrid system in real-time\nOpal-RT platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in\ncomparison with the traditional weighted least square and tracking state\nestimation methods.",

In recent years, image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation\n(WSSS), including single- and multi-stage process, has attracted large\nattention due to data labeling efficiency. In this paper, we propose to embed\naffinity learning of multi-stage approaches in a single-stage model.

    "abstract": "Reading comprehension is a complex cognitive process involving many human\nbrain activities. Plenty of works have studied the reading patterns and\nattention allocation mechanisms in the reading process. However, little is\nknown about what happens in human brain during reading comprehension and how we\ncan utilize this information as implicit feedback to facilitate information\nacquisition performance. With the advances in brain imaging techniques such as\nEEG, it is possible to collect high-precision brain signals in almost real\ntime. With neuroimaging techniques, we carefully design a lab-based user study\nto investigate brain activities during reading comprehension. Our findings show\nthat neural responses vary with different types of contents, i.e., contents\nthat can satisfy users' information needs and contents that cannot. We suggest\nthat various cognitive activities, e.g., cognitive loading, semantic-thematic\nunderstanding, and inferential processing, at the micro-time scale during\nreading comprehension underpin these neural responses. Inspired by these\ndetectable differences in cognitive activities, we construct supervised\nlearning models based on EEG features for two reading comprehension tasks:\nanswer sentence classification and answer extraction. Results show that it is\nfeasible to improve their performance with brain signals. These findings imply\nthat brain signals are valuable feedback for enhancing human-computer\ninteractions during reading comprehension.",

We further uncover the latent space semantics of the trained GAN model,\nby learning a similarity model between text representations and the latent\ncodes.

In\nmulti-head attention mechanism, different heads attend to different parts of\nthe input. However, the limitation is that multiple heads might attend to the\nsame part of the input, resulting in multiple heads being redundant. Thus, the\nmodel resources are under-utilized. One approach to avoid this is to prune\nleast important heads based on certain importance score. In this work, we focus\non designing a Dynamic Head Importance Computation Mechanism (DHICM) to\ndynamically calculate the importance of a head with respect to the input. Our\ninsight is to design an additional attention layer together with multi-head\nattention, and utilize the outputs of the multi-head attention along with the\ninput, to compute the importance for each head. Additionally, we add an extra\nloss function to prevent the model from assigning same score to all heads, to\nidentify more important heads and improvise performance. We analyzed\nperformance of DHICM for NMT with different languages. Experiments on different\ndatasets show that DHICM outperforms traditional Transformer-based approach by\nlarge margin, especially, when less training data is available.",

    "abstract": "Vision transformers have recently received explosive popularity, but huge\ncomputational cost is still a severe issue. Recent efficient designs for vision\ntransformers follow two pipelines, namely, structural compression based on\nlocal spatial prior and non-structural token pruning. However, rough token\npruning breaks the spatial structure that is indispensable for local spatial\nprior. To take advantage of both two pipelines, this work seeks to dynamically\nidentify uninformative tokens for each instance and trim down both the training\nand inference complexity while maintain complete spatial structure and\ninformation flow. To achieve this goal, we propose Evo-ViT, a self-motivated\nslow-fast token evolution method for vision transformers. Specifically, we\nconduct unstructured instance-wise token selection by taking advantage of the\nglobal class attention that is unique to vision transformers. Then, we propose\nto update information tokens and placeholder tokens that contribute little to\nthe final prediction with different computational properties, namely, slow-fast\nupdating. Thanks to the slow-fast updating mechanism that guarantees\ninformation flow and spatial structure, our Evo-ViT can accelerate vanilla\ntransformers of both flat and deep-narrow structures from the very beginning of\nthe training process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\ncan significantly reduce the computational costs of vision transformers while\nmaintaining comparable performance on image classification. For example, our\nmethod accelerates DeiT-S by over 60% throughput while only sacrificing 0.4%\ntop-1 accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Designing a 3D game scene is a tedious task that often requires a substantial\namount of work. Typically, this task involves synthesis, coloring, and\nplacement of 3D models within the game scene. To lessen this workload, we can\napply machine learning to automate some aspects of the game scene development.\nEarlier research has already tackled automated generation of the game scene\nbackground with machine learning. However, model auto-coloring remains an\nunderexplored problem. The automatic coloring of a 3D model is a challenging\ntask, especially when dealing with the digital representation of a colorful,\nmultipart object. In such a case, we have to ``understand'' the object's\ncomposition and coloring scheme of each part. Existing single-stage methods\nhave their own caveats such as the need for segmentation of the object or\ngenerating individual parts that have to be assembled together to yield the\nfinal model. We address these limitations by proposing a two-stage training\napproach to synthesize auto-colored 3D models. In the first stage, we obtain a\n3D point cloud representing a 3D object, whilst in the second stage, we assign\ncolors to points within such cloud. Next, by leveraging the so-called\ntriangulation trick, we generate a 3D mesh in which the surfaces are colored\nbased on interpolation of colored points representing vertices of a given mesh\ntriangle. This approach allows us to generate a smooth coloring scheme.\nExperimental evaluation shows that our two-stage approach gives better results\nin terms of shape reconstruction and coloring when compared to traditional\nsingle-stage techniques.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing fourth Industrial Revolution depends mainly on robust Industrial\nCyber-Physical Systems (ICPS). ICPS includes computing (software and hardware)\nabilities to control complex physical processes in distributed industrial\nenvironments. Industrial agents, originating from the well-established\nmulti-agent systems field, provide complex and cooperative control mechanisms\nat the software level, allowing us to develop larger and more feature-rich\nICPS. The IEEE P2660.1 standardisation project, \"Recommended Practices on\nIndustrial Agents: Integration of Software Agents and Low Level Automation\nFunctions\" focuses on identifying Industrial Agent practices that can benefit\nICPS systems of the future. A key problem within this project is identifying\nthe best-fit industrial agent practices for a given ICPS. This paper reports on\nthe design and development of a tool to address this challenge. This tool,\ncalled IASelect, is built using graph databases and provides the ability to\nflexibly and visually query a growing repository of industrial agent practices\nrelevant to ICPS. IASelect includes a front-end that allows industry\npractitioners to interactively identify best-fit practices without having to\nwrite manual queries.",

    "abstract": "The role of predicting sarcasm in the text is known as automatic sarcasm\ndetection. Given the prevalence and challenges of sarcasm in sentiment-bearing\ntext, this is a critical phase in most sentiment analysis tasks. With the\nincreasing popularity and usage of different social media platforms among users\naround the world, people are using sarcasm more and more in their day-to-day\nconversations, social media posts and tweets, and it is considered as a way for\npeople to express their sentiment about some certain topics or issues. As a\nresult of the increasing popularity, researchers started to focus their\nresearch endeavors on detecting sarcasm from a text in different languages\nespecially the English language. However, the task of sarcasm detection is a\nchallenging task due to the nature of sarcastic texts; which can be relative\nand significantly differs from one person to another depending on the topic,\nregion, the user's mentality and other factors. In addition to these\nchallenges, sarcasm detection in the Arabic language has its own challenges due\nto the complexity of the Arabic language, such as being morphologically rich,\nwith many dialects that significantly vary between each other, while also being\nlowly resourced. In recent years, only few research attempts started tackling\nthe task of sarcasm detection in Arabic, including creating and collecting\ncorpora, organizing workshops and establishing baseline models. This paper\nintends to create a new humanly annotated Arabic corpus for sarcasm detection\ncollected from tweets, and implementing a new approach for sarcasm detection\nand quantification in Arabic tweets. The annotation technique followed in this\npaper is unique in sarcasm detection and the proposed approach tackles the\nproblem as a regression problem instead of classification; i.e., the model\nattempts to predict the level of sarcasm instead of binary classification.",

    "abstract": "Noisy labels are commonly found in real-world data, which cause performance\ndegradation of deep neural networks. Cleaning data manually is labour-intensive\nand time-consuming. Previous research mostly focuses on enhancing\nclassification models against noisy labels, while the robustness of deep metric\nlearning (DML) against noisy labels remains less well-explored. In this paper,\nwe bridge this important gap by proposing Probabilistic Ranking-based Instance\nSelection with Memory (PRISM) approach for DML. PRISM calculates the\nprobability of a label being clean, and filters out potentially noisy samples.\nSpecifically, we propose three methods to calculate this probability: 1)\nAverage Similarity Method (AvgSim), which calculates the average similarity\nbetween potentially noisy data and clean data; 2) Proxy Similarity Method\n(ProxySim), which replaces the centers maintained by AvgSim with the proxies\ntrained by proxy-based method; and 3) von Mises-Fisher Distribution Similarity\n(vMF-Sim), which estimates a von Mises-Fisher distribution for each data class.\nWith such a design, the proposed approach can deal with challenging DML\nsituations in which the majority of the samples are noisy. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy dataset show that the\nproposed approach achieves up to 8.37% higher Precision@1 compared with the\nbest performing state-of-the-art baseline approaches, within reasonable\ntraining time.",

First, we analyze the three MAB algorithms using simulated\npurchasing datasets with non-stationary reward distributions to simulate the\npossible time-varying customer preferences, where the traffic allocation\ndynamics and the accumulative rewards of different algorithms are studied.\nSecond, we compare the accumulative rewards of the three MAB algorithms with\nmore than 1,000 trials using actual historical A/B test datasets. We find that\nthe larger difference between the success rates of competing recommendations\nthe more accumulative rewards the MAB algorithms can achieve. In addition, we\nfind that TS shows the highest average accumulative rewards under different\ntesting scenarios. Third, we develop a batch-updated MAB algorithm to overcome\nthe delayed reward issue in e-commerce and enable an online content\noptimization on our App homepage.

    "abstract": "Accounting for the fact that users have different sequential patterns, the\nmain drawback of state-of-the-art recommendation strategies is that a fixed\nsequence length of user-item interactions is required as input to train the\nmodels. This might limit the recommendation accuracy, as in practice users\nfollow different trends on the sequential recommendations. Hence, baseline\nstrategies might ignore important sequential interactions or add noise to the\nmodels with redundant interactions, depending on the variety of users'\nsequential behaviours. To overcome this problem, in this study we propose the\nSAR model, which not only learns the sequential patterns but also adjusts the\nsequence length of user-item interactions in a personalized manner. We first\ndesign an actor-critic framework, where the RL agent tries to compute the\noptimal sequence length as an action, given the user's state representation at\na certain time step. In addition, we optimize a joint loss function to align\nthe accuracy of the sequential recommendations with the expected cumulative\nrewards of the critic network, while at the same time we adapt the sequence\nlength with the actor network in a personalized manner. Our experimental\nevaluation on four real-world datasets demonstrates the superiority of our\nproposed model over several baseline approaches.

Recent attempts in this direction have relied on\nlearning disentangled representations from data such that the underlying\nfactors of variation are well separated. In this paper, we focus on the\nrelationship between disentanglement and controllability by conducting a\nsystematic study using different supervised disentanglement learning algorithms\nbased on the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) architecture. Our experiments show\nthat a high degree of disentanglement can be achieved by using different forms\nof supervision to train a strong discriminative encoder. However, in the\nabsence of a strong generative decoder, disentanglement does not necessarily\nimply controllability. The structure of the latent space with respect to the\nVAE-decoder plays an important role in boosting the ability of a generative\nmodel to manipulate different attributes. To this end, we also propose methods\nand metrics to help evaluate the quality of a latent space with respect to the\nafforded degree of controllability.",

Its development has been triggered by the need\nto obtain accurate text representations for knowledge extraction tasks that\npreserve the spatial alignment of text without drawing upon heavyweight,\nbrowser-based solutions such as Selenium. In contrast to existing software\npackages such as HTML2text, jusText and Lynx, Inscriptis (i) provides a\nlayout-aware conversion of HTML that more closely resembles the rendering\nobtained from standard Web browsers and, therefore, better preserves the\nspatial arrangement of text elements. Inscriptis excels in terms of conversion\nquality, since it correctly converts complex HTML constructs such as nested\ntables and also interprets a subset of HTML attributes that determine the text\nalignment. In addition, it (ii) supports annotation rules, i.e., user-provided\nmappings that allow for annotating the extracted text based on structural and\nsemantic information encoded in HTML tags and attributes used for controlling\nstructure and layout in the original HTML document. These unique features\nensure that downstream knowledge extraction components can operate on accurate\ntext representations, and may even use information on the semantics and\nstructure of the original HTML document, if annotation support has been\nenabled.",

    "abstract": "So far, most research on recommender systems focused on maintaining long-term\nuser engagement and satisfaction, by promoting relevant and personalized\ncontent. However, it is still very challenging to evaluate the quality and the\nreliability of this content. In this paper, we propose FEBR (Expert-Based\nRecommendation Framework), an apprenticeship learning framework to assess the\nquality of the recommended content on online platforms. The framework exploits\nthe demonstrated trajectories of an expert (assumed to be reliable) in a\nrecommendation evaluation environment, to recover an unknown utility function.\nThis function is used to learn an optimal policy describing the expert's\nbehavior, which is then used in the framework to provide high-quality and\npersonalized recommendations. We evaluate the performance of our solution\nthrough a user interest simulation environment (using RecSim). We simulate\ninteractions under the aforementioned expert policy for videos recommendation,\nand compare its efficiency with standard recommendation methods. The results\nshow that our approach provides a significant gain in terms of content quality,\nevaluated by experts and watched by users, while maintaining almost the same\nwatch time as the baseline approaches.",

    "abstract": "The cost of the power distribution infrastructures is driven by the peak\npower encountered in the system. Therefore, the distribution network operators\nconsider billing consumers behind a common transformer in the function of their\npeak demand and leave it to the consumers to manage their collective costs.\nThis management problem is, however, not trivial. In this paper, we consider a\nmulti-agent residential smart grid system, where each agent has local renewable\nenergy production and energy storage, and all agents are connected to a local\ntransformer. The objective is to develop an optimal policy that minimizes the\neconomic cost consisting of both the spot-market cost for each consumer and\ntheir collective peak-power cost. We propose to use a parametric Model\nPredictive Control (MPC)-scheme to approximate the optimal policy. The\noptimality of this policy is limited by its finite horizon and inaccurate\nforecasts of the local power production-consumption. A Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DPG) method is deployed to adjust the MPC parameters and improve the\npolicy. Our simulations show that the proposed MPC-based Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) method can effectively decrease the long-term economic cost for this smart\ngrid problem.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the design of a rational decision support system (RDSS) for a\nconnected and autonomous vehicle charging infrastructure (CAV-CI) is studied.\nIn the considered CAV-CI, the distribution system operator (DSO) deploys\nelectric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) to provide an EV charging facility for\nhuman-driven connected vehicles (CVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). The\ncharging request by the human-driven EV becomes irrational when it demands more\nenergy and charging period than its actual need. Therefore, the scheduling\npolicy of each EVSE must be adaptively accumulated the irrational charging\nrequest to satisfy the charging demand of both CVs and AVs. To tackle this, we\nformulate an RDSS problem for the DSO, where the objective is to maximize the\ncharging capacity utilization by satisfying the laxity risk of the DSO. Thus,\nwe devise a rational reward maximization problem to adapt the irrational\nbehavior by CVs in a data-informed manner. We propose a novel risk adversarial\nmulti-agent learning system (RAMALS) for CAV-CI to solve the formulated RDSS\nproblem. In RAMALS, the DSO acts as a centralized risk adversarial agent (RAA)\nfor informing the laxity risk to each EVSE. Subsequently, each EVSE plays the\nrole of a self-learner agent to adaptively schedule its own EV sessions by\ncoping advice from RAA. Experiment results show that the proposed RAMALS\naffords around 46.6% improvement in charging rate, about 28.6% improvement in\nthe EVSE's active charging time and at least 33.3% more energy utilization, as\ncompared to a currently deployed ACN EVSE system, and other baselines.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems(RS), especially collaborative filtering(CF) based RS, has\nbeen playing an important role in many e-commerce applications. As the\ninformation being searched over the internet is rapidly increasing, users often\nface the difficulty of finding items of his/her own interest and RS often\nprovides help in such tasks. Recent studies show that, as the item space\nincreases, and the number of items rated by the users become very less, issues\nlike sparsity arise. To mitigate the sparsity problem, transfer learning\ntechniques are being used wherein the data from dense domain(source) is\nconsidered in order to predict the missing entries in the sparse\ndomain(target). In this paper, we propose a transfer learning approach for\ncross-domain recommendation when both domains have no overlap of users and\nitems. In our approach the transferring of knowledge from source to target\ndomain is done in a novel way. We make use of co-clustering technique to obtain\nthe codebook (cluster-level rating pattern) of source domain. By making use of\nhinge loss function we transfer the learnt codebook of the source domain to\ntarget. The use of hinge loss as a loss function is novel and has not been\ntried before in transfer learning. We demonstrate that our technique improves\nthe approximation of the target matrix on benchmark datasets.",

In this paper, we tackle this issue by\nconducting a systematic cross-modal analysis of sensor-algorithm combinations\ntypically used in robotics.

    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised object detection (WSOD) has emerged as an inspiring recent\ntopic to avoid expensive instance-level object annotations. However, the\nbounding boxes of most existing WSOD methods are mainly determined by\nprecomputed proposals, thereby being limited in precise object localization. In\nthis paper, we defend the problem setting for improving localization\nperformance by leveraging the bounding box regression knowledge from a\nwell-annotated auxiliary dataset. First, we use the well-annotated auxiliary\ndataset to explore a series of learnable bounding box adjusters (LBBAs) in a\nmulti-stage training manner, which is class-agnostic. Then, only LBBAs and a\nweakly-annotated dataset with non-overlapped classes are used for training\nLBBA-boosted WSOD. As such, our LBBAs are practically more convenient and\neconomical to implement while avoiding the leakage of the auxiliary\nwell-annotated dataset. In particular, we formulate learning bounding box\nadjusters as a bi-level optimization problem and suggest an EM-like multi-stage\ntraining algorithm. Then, a multi-stage scheme is further presented for\nLBBA-boosted WSOD. Additionally, a masking strategy is adopted to improve\nproposal classification. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our\nmethod. Our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art WSOD methods and\nknowledge transfer model with similar problem setting.

However, many datasets in this area are isolated from other domains\nwith records of only energy-related data. This may raise a loss of information\n(e.g. weather) that is relevant to the energy use of each device. A noticeable\ndisadvantage is that many of those datasets have to be used in computational\nmodeling approaches such as machine learning models, which are vulnerable to\nthe data feed, to advance the understanding of energy consumption and\nproduction. Although such computational methods have achieved a high benchmark\nmerely through a local view of datasets, the reusability cannot be firmly\nguaranteed when the information omission is taken into account.

Moreover, we show that discrete solutions exist and depend\ncontinuously on the initial and boundary data. We then pass to the limit in the\ndiscretization parameters and prove that there exists a global-in-time weak\nsolution to the model. Under additional assumptions, this weak solution is\nunique. Finally, we present some numerical results including numerical error\ninvestigation in one spatial dimension and some long time simulations in two\nand three spatial dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Physical reservoir computing is a computational paradigm that enables\ntemporal pattern recognition to be performed directly in physical matter. By\nexciting non-linear dynamical systems and linearly classifying their changes in\nstate, we can create highly energy-efficient devices capable of solving machine\nlearning tasks without the need to build a modular system consisting of\nmillions of neurons interconnected by synapses. The chosen dynamical system\nmust have three desirable properties: non-linearity, complexity, and fading\nmemory to act as an effective reservoir. We present task agnostic quantitative\nmeasures for each of these three requirements and exemplify them for two\nreservoirs: an echo state network and a simulated magnetic skyrmion-based\nreservoir. We show that, in general, systems with lower damping reach higher\nvalues in all three performance metrics. Whilst for input signal strength,\nthere is a natural trade-off between memory capacity and non-linearity of the\nreservoir's behaviour. In contrast to typical task-dependent reservoir\ncomputing benchmarks, these metrics can be evaluated in parallel from a single\ninput signal, drastically speeding up the parameter search to design efficient\nand high-performance reservoirs.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art deep face recognition methods are mostly trained with a\nsoftmax-based multi-class classification framework. Despite being popular and\neffective, these methods still have a few shortcomings that limit empirical\nperformance. In this paper, we first identify the discrepancy between training\nand evaluation in the existing multi-class classification framework and then\ndiscuss the potential limitations caused by the \"competitive\" nature of softmax\nnormalization. Motivated by these limitations, we propose a novel binary\nclassification training framework, termed SphereFace2. In contrast to existing\nmethods, SphereFace2 circumvents the softmax normalization, as well as the\ncorresponding closed-set assumption. This effectively bridges the gap between\ntraining and evaluation, enabling the representations to be improved\nindividually by each binary classification task. Besides designing a specific\nwell-performing loss function, we summarize a few general principles for this\n\"one-vs-all\" binary classification framework so that it can outperform current\ncompetitive methods. We conduct comprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks\nto demonstrate that SphereFace2 can consistently outperform current\nstate-of-the-art deep face recognition methods.",

But how the level of\nsparsity contributes to performance on visual tasks is not well understood. In\nthis work, sparse coding has been integrated into an existing hierarchical V2\nmodel (Hosoya and Hyv\\\"arinen, 2015), but replacing the Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA) with an explicit sparse coding in which the degree of sparsity\ncan be controlled. After training, the sparse coding basis functions with a\nhigher degree of sparsity resembled qualitatively different structures, such as\ncurves and corners. The contributions of the models were assessed with image\nclassification tasks, including object classification, and tasks associated\nwith mid-level vision including figure-ground classification, texture\nclassification, and angle prediction between two line stimuli. In addition, the\nmodels were assessed in comparison to a texture sensitivity measure that has\nbeen reported in V2 (Freeman et al., 2013), and a deleted-region inference\ntask. The results from the experiments show that while sparse coding performed\nworse than ICA at classifying images, only sparse coding was able to better\nmatch the texture sensitivity level of V2 and infer deleted image regions, both\nby increasing the degree of sparsity in sparse coding. Higher degrees of\nsparsity allowed for inference over larger deleted image regions. The mechanism\nthat allows for this inference capability in sparse coding is described here.",

    "abstract": "Transporting objects using quadrotors with cables has been widely studied in\nthe literature. However, most of those approaches assume that the cables are\npreviously attached to the load by human intervention. In tasks where multiple\nobjects need to be moved, the efficiency of the robotic system is constrained\nby the requirement of manual labor. Our approach uses a non-stretchable cable\nconnected to two quadrotors, which we call the catenary robot, that fully\nautomates the transportation task. Using the cable, we can roll and drag the\ncuboid object (box) on planar surfaces. Depending on the surface type, we\nchoose the proper action, dragging for low friction, and rolling for high\nfriction. Therefore, the transportation process does not require any human\nintervention as we use the cable to interact with the box without requiring\nfastening. We validate our control design in simulation and with actual robots,\nwhere we show them rolling and dragging boxes to track desired trajectories.",

    "abstract": "In order to develop systems capable of artificial evolution, we need to\nidentify which systems can produce complex behavior. We present a novel\nclassification method applicable to any class of deterministic discrete space\nand time dynamical systems. The method is based on classifying the asymptotic\nbehavior of the average computation time in a given system before entering a\nloop. We were able to identify a critical region of behavior that corresponds\nto a phase transition from ordered behavior to chaos across various classes of\ndynamical systems. To show that our approach can be applied to many different\ncomputational systems, we demonstrate the results of classifying cellular\nautomata, Turing machines, and random Boolean networks. Further, we use this\nmethod to classify 2D cellular automata to automatically find those with\ninteresting, complex dynamics.\nWe believe that our work can be used to design systems in which complex\nstructures emerge. Also, it can be used to compare various versions of existing\nattempts to model open-ended evolution (Ray (1991), Ofria et al. (2004),\nChannon (2006)).",

    "abstract": "Image-based virtual try-on is challenging in fitting a target in-shop clothes\ninto a reference person under diverse human poses. Previous works focus on\npreserving clothing details ( e.g., texture, logos, patterns ) when\ntransferring desired clothes onto a target person under a fixed pose. However,\nthe performances of existing methods significantly dropped when extending\nexisting methods to multi-pose virtual try-on. In this paper, we propose an\nend-to-end Semantic Prediction Guidance multi-pose Virtual Try-On Network\n(SPG-VTON), which could fit the desired clothing into a reference person under\narbitrary poses. Concretely, SPG-VTON is composed of three sub-modules. First,\na Semantic Prediction Module (SPM) generates the desired semantic map. The\npredicted semantic map provides more abundant guidance to locate the desired\nclothes region and produce a coarse try-on image. Second, a Clothes Warping\nModule (CWM) warps in-shop clothes to the desired shape according to the\npredicted semantic map and the desired pose. Specifically, we introduce a\nconductible cycle consistency loss to alleviate the misalignment in the clothes\nwarping process. Third, a Try-on Synthesis Module (TSM) combines the coarse\nresult and the warped clothes to generate the final virtual try-on image,\npreserving details of the desired clothes and under the desired pose. Besides,\nwe introduce a face identity loss to refine the facial appearance and maintain\nthe identity of the final virtual try-on result at the same time. We evaluate\nthe proposed method on the most massive multi-pose dataset (MPV) and the\nDeepFashion dataset. The qualitative and quantitative experiments show that\nSPG-VTON is superior to the state-of-the-art methods and is robust to the data\nnoise, including background and accessory changes, i.e., hats and handbags,\nshowing good scalability to the real-world scenario.",

Similarly, AI has evidently been proved\nuseful to software engineering (SE). When one observes the SE phases\n(requirements, design, development, testing, release, and maintenance), it\nbecomes clear that multiple AI paradigms (such as neural networks, machine\nlearning, knowledge-based systems, natural language processing) could be\napplied to improve the process and eliminate many of the major challenges that\nthe SE field has been facing. This survey chapter is a review of the most\ncommonplace methods of AI applied to SE. The review covers methods between\nyears 1975-2017, for the requirements phase, 46 major AI-driven methods are\nfound, 19 for design, 15 for development, 68 for testing, and 15 for release\nand maintenance. Furthermore, the purpose of this chapter is threefold;\nfirstly, to answer the following questions: is there sufficient intelligence in\nthe SE lifecycle? What does applying AI to SE entail? Secondly, to measure,\nformulize, and evaluate the overlap of SE phases and AI disciplines.

Constitutive models are models that describe the\nbehaviour of materials for instance deformation processes through applied\nforces.

The method is demonstrated for\na constitutive model which is used in computational mechanics to describe the\nmaterial response to various thermo-mechanical loading conditions.

    "abstract": "Enhancing roadway safety is a priority of transportation. Hence, Artificial\nIntelligence (AI)-powered crash anticipation is receiving growing attention,\nwhich aims to assist drivers and Automated Driving Systems (ADSs) in avoiding\ncrashes. To gain the trust from ADS users, it is essential to benchmark the\nperformance of AI models against humans. This paper establishes a gaze\ndata-based method with the measures and metrics for evaluating human drivers'\nability to anticipate crashes. A laboratory experiment is designed and\nperformed, wherein a screen-based eye tracker collects the gaze data of six\nvolunteers when they are watching 100 videos that include both normal and risky\ndriving scenes. Statistical analyses (at the 0.05 significance level) of\nexperimental data show that on average drivers can anticipate a crash up to\n2.61+-0.100 seconds before it occurs. The chance whereby drivers have\nanticipated crashes before they occur, termed humans' recall, is 0.928+-0.0206.\nAn AI model achieving the same recall value can anticipate crashes 2.22 seconds\nearlier than drivers on average, and the anticipation precision is 0.959. The\nstudy finds that crash involved traffic agents in driving scenes can vary\ndrivers' instant attention level, average attention level, and spatial\nattention distribution. This finding supports AI models that learn a dynamic\nspatial-temporal attention mechanism for strengthening their ability to\nanticipate crashes. Results from the comparison suggests benefits of keeping\nhuman-in-the-loop, including further refining AI models with human inputs and\nusing AI-rendered anticipation to increase the situational awareness of drivers\nin partial or conditional automation.",

    "title": "Scheduling Aerial Vehicles in an Urban Air Mobility Scheme",
    "abstract": "Highly populated cities face several challenges, one of them being the\nintense traffic congestion. In recent years, the concept of Urban Air Mobility\nhas been put forward by large companies and organizations as a way to address\nthis problem, and this approach has been rapidly gaining ground. This\ndisruptive technology involves aerial vehicles (AVs) for hire than can be\nutilized by customers to travel between locations within large cities. This\nconcept has the potential to drastically decrease traffic congestion and reduce\nair pollution, since these vehicles typically use electric motors powered by\nbatteries. This work studies the problem of scheduling the assignment of AVs to\ncustomers, having as a goal to maximize the serviced customers and minimize the\nenergy consumption of the AVs by forcing them to fly at the lowest possible\naltitude. Initially, an Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation is presented,\nthat is solved offline and optimally, followed by a near-optimal algorithm,\nthat solves the problem incrementally, one AV at a time, to address scalability\nissues, allowing scheduling in problems involving large numbers of locations,\nAVs, and customer requests.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel, computationally inexpensive approach for imaging with\nan active array of sensors, which probe an unknown medium with a pulse and\nmeasure the resulting waves. The imaging function uses a data driven estimate\nof the \"internal wave\" originating from the vicinity of the imaging point and\npropagating to the sensors through the unknown medium. We explain how this\nestimate can be obtained using a reduced order model (ROM) for the wave\npropagation. We analyze the imaging function, connect it to the time reversal\nprocess and describe how its resolution depends on the aperture of the array,\nthe bandwidth of the probing pulse and the medium through which the waves\npropagate. We also show how the internal wave can be used for selective\nfocusing of waves at points in the imaging region. This can be implemented\nexperimentally and can be used for pixel scanning imaging. We assess the\nperformance of the imaging methods with numerical simulations and compare them\nto the conventional reverse-time migration method and the \"backprojection\"\nmethod introduced recently as an application of the same ROM.",

Some recent works tackle source-free\ndomain adaptation (SFDA) where only a source pre-trained model is available for\nadaptation to the target domain. However, those methods do not consider keeping\nsource performance which is of high practical value in real world applications.\nIn this paper, we propose a new domain adaptation paradigm called Generalized\nSource-free Domain Adaptation (G-SFDA), where the learned model needs to\nperform well on both the target and source domains, with only access to current\nunlabeled target data during adaptation. First, we propose local structure\nclustering (LSC), aiming to cluster the target features with its semantically\nsimilar neighbors, which successfully adapts the model to the target domain in\nthe absence of source data. Second, we propose sparse domain attention (SDA),\nit produces a binary domain specific attention to activate different feature\nchannels for different domains, meanwhile the domain attention will be utilized\nto regularize the gradient during adaptation to keep source information. In the\nexperiments, for target performance our method is on par with or better than\nexisting DA and SFDA methods, specifically it achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance (85.4%) on VisDA, and our method works well for all domains after\nadapting to single or multiple target domains.

Uncertainty surrounds the\nfuture of automated mobility as there is no clear consensus on potential\nadoption patterns, ownership versus shared use status and travel impacts.\nAdding to this uncertainty is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that has\ntriggered profound changes in mobility behaviors as well as accelerated the\nadoption of new technologies at an unprecedented rate. This study examines the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on willingness to adopt the emerging new\ntechnology of self-driving vehicles. Using data from a survey disseminated in\nJune 2020 to 700 respondents in contiguous United States, we perform a\ndifference-in-difference regression to analyze the shift in willingness to use\nautonomous vehicles as part of a shared fleet before and during the pandemic.\nThe results reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic has a positive and highly\nsignificant impact on consideration of autonomous vehicles. This shift is\npresent regardless of techsavviness, gender or political views. Individuals who\nare younger, left-leaning and frequent users of shared modes of travel are\nexpected to become more likely to use autonomous vehicles once offered.\nUnderstanding the effects of these attributes on the increase in consideration\nof AVs is important for policy making, as these effects provide a guide to\npredicting adoption of autonomous vehicles - once available - and to identify\nsegments of the population likely to be more resistant to adopting AVs.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the applications of stochastic spectral methods for\nstructural topology optimization in the presence of uncertainties. A\nnon-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion is integrated into a topology\noptimization algorithm to calculate low-order statistical moments of the\nmechanical-mathematical model response. This procedure, known as robust\ntopology optimization, can optimize the mean of the compliance while\nsimultaneously minimizing its standard deviation. In order to address possible\nvariabilities in the loads applied to the mechanical system of interest,\nmagnitude and direction of the external forces are assumed to be uncertain. In\nthis probabilistic framework, forces are described as a random field or a set\nof random variables. Representation of the random objects and propagation of\nload uncertainties through the model are efficiently done through\nKarhunen-Lo\\`{e}ve and polynomial chaos expansions. We take advantage of using\npolygonal elements, which have been shown to be effective in suppressing\ncheckerboard patterns and reducing mesh dependency in the solution of topology\noptimization problems. Accuracy and applicability of the proposed methodology\nare demonstrated by means of several topology optimization examples. The\nobtained results, which are in excellent agreement with reference solutions\ncomputed via Monte Carlo method, show that load uncertainties play an important\nrole in optimal design of structural systems, so that they must be taken into\naccount to ensure a reliable optimization process.",

    "abstract": "The quality of images captured by smartphones is an important specification\nsince smartphones are becoming ubiquitous as primary capturing devices. The\ntraditional image signal processing (ISP) pipeline in a smartphone camera\nconsists of several image processing steps performed sequentially to\nreconstruct a high quality sRGB image from the raw sensor data. These steps\nconsist of demosaicing, denoising, white balancing, gamma correction, colour\nenhancement, etc. Since each of them are performed sequentially using\nhand-crafted algorithms, the residual error from each processing module\naccumulates in the final reconstructed signal. Thus, the traditional ISP\npipeline has limited reconstruction quality in terms of generalizability across\ndifferent lighting conditions and associated noise levels while capturing the\nimage. Deep learning methods using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have\nbecome popular in solving many image-related tasks such as image denoising,\ncontrast enhancement, super resolution, deblurring, etc. Furthermore, recent\napproaches for the RAW to sRGB conversion using deep learning methods have also\nbeen published, however, their immense complexity in terms of their memory\nrequirement and number of Mult-Adds make them unsuitable for mobile camera ISP.\nIn this paper we propose DelNet - a single end-to-end deep learning model - to\nlearn the entire ISP pipeline within reasonable complexity for smartphone\ndeployment. Del-Net is a multi-scale architecture that uses spatial and channel\nattention to capture global features like colour, as well as a series of\nlightweight modified residual attention blocks to help with denoising.

The grid operator first\ncomputes a controlled islanding strategy, along with the power generation for\nthe post-islanding system to guarantee stability. The adversary observes the\nstrategies of the grid operator. The adversary then identifies critical\nsubstations of the power system to compromise and trips the transmission lines\nthat are connected with compromised substations.

We show that the best responses for the grid operator and\nadversary can be formulated as mixed integer linear programs. In addition, the\nbest response of the adversary is equivalent to a submodular maximization\nproblem under a cardinality constraint, which can be approximated up to a\n$(1-\\frac{1}{e})$ optimality bound in polynomial time.

Large-scale DGMs are notoriously hard to\ntrain, requiring expert skills, large amounts of data and extensive\ncomputational resources. Thus, it can be expected that many enterprises will\nresort to sourcing pre-trained DGMs from potentially unverified third parties,\ne.g.~open source model repositories.\nAs we show in this paper, such a deployment scenario poses a new attack\nsurface, which allows adversaries to potentially undermine the integrity of\nentire machine learning development pipelines in a victim organization.\nSpecifically, we describe novel training-time attacks resulting in corrupted\nDGMs that synthesize regular data under normal operations and designated target\noutputs for inputs sampled from a trigger distribution.

    "abstract": "Spectral graph convolutional networks (SGCNs) have been attracting increasing\nattention in graph representation learning partly due to their interpretability\nthrough the prism of the established graph signal processing framework.\nHowever, existing SGCNs are limited in implementing graph convolutions with\nrigid transforms that could not adapt to signals residing on graphs and tasks\nat hand. In this paper, we propose a novel class of spectral graph\nconvolutional networks that implement graph convolutions with adaptive graph\nwavelets. Specifically, the adaptive graph wavelets are learned with neural\nnetwork-parameterized lifting structures, where structure-aware attention-based\nlifting operations are developed to jointly consider graph structures and node\nfeatures. We propose to lift based on diffusion wavelets to alleviate the\nstructural information loss induced by partitioning non-bipartite graphs. By\ndesign, the locality and sparsity of the resulting wavelet transform as well as\nthe scalability of the lifting structure for large and varying-size graphs are\nguaranteed. We further derive a soft-thresholding filtering operation by\nlearning sparse graph representations in terms of the learned wavelets, which\nimproves the scalability and interpretablity, and yield a localized, efficient\nand scalable spectral graph convolution. To ensure that the learned graph\nrepresentations are invariant to node permutations, a layer is employed at the\ninput of the networks to reorder the nodes according to their local topology\ninformation. We evaluate the proposed networks in both node-level and\ngraph-level representation learning tasks on benchmark citation and\nbioinformatics graph datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed networks over existing SGCNs in terms of accuracy,\nefficiency and scalability.",

These disagreements raise\nthe question: which, if any, of these dissimilarity measures should we believe?\nWe provide a framework to ground this question through a concrete test:\nmeasures should have sensitivity to changes that affect functional behavior,\nand specificity against changes that do not. We quantify this through a variety\nof functional behaviors including probing accuracy and robustness to\ndistribution shift, and examine changes such as varying random initialization\nand deleting principal components.

    "abstract": "Poor laryngeal muscle coordination that results in abnormal glottal posturing\nis believed to be a primary etiologic factor in common voice disorders such as\nnon-phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction. An imbalance in the activity of\nantagonistic laryngeal muscles is hypothesized to play a key role in the\nalteration of normal vocal fold biomechanics that results in the dysphonia\nassociated with such disorders. Current low-order models are unsatisfactory to\ntest this hypothesis since they do not capture the co-contraction of antagonist\nlaryngeal muscle pairs. To address this limitation, a scheme for controlling a\nself-sustained triangular body-cover model with intrinsic muscle control is\nintroduced. The approach builds upon prior efforts and allows for exploring the\nrole of antagonistic muscle pairs in phonation. The proposed scheme is\nillustrated through the ample agreement with prior studies using finite element\nmodels, excised larynges, and clinical studies in sustained and time-varying\nvocal gestures. Pilot simulations of abnormal scenarios illustrated that poorly\nregulated and elevated muscle activities result in more abducted prephonatory\nposturing, which lead to inefficient phonation and subglottal pressure\ncompensation to regain loudness.

In this paper, we present a more positive\noutlook. We propose a model of comparing candidates in elections, which we call\nthe Advantage-Standard (AS) model. The requirement that a collective choice\nrule (CCR) be rationalizable by the AS model is in the spirit of but weaker\nthan IIA; yet it is stronger than what is known in the literature as weak IIA\n(two profiles alike on x, y cannot have opposite strict social preferences on x\nand y). In addition to motivating violations of IIA, the AS model makes\nintelligible violations of another Arrovian assumption: the negative\ntransitivity of the strict social preference relation P. While previous\nliterature shows that only weakening IIA to weak IIA or only weakening negative\ntransitivity of P to acyclicity still leads to impossibility theorems, we show\nthat jointly weakening IIA to AS rationalizability and weakening negative\ntransitivity of P leads to no such impossibility theorems. Indeed, we show that\nseveral appealing CCRs are AS rationalizable, including even transitive CCRs.",

This structure can be accurately captured using state space models\nwith explicit dynamics, such as those based on recurrent neural networks\n(RNNs).

Here we introduce the Neural Data Transformer (NDT),\na non-recurrent alternative. We test the NDT's ability to capture autonomous\ndynamical systems by applying it to synthetic datasets with known dynamics and\ndata from monkey motor cortex during a reaching task well-modeled by RNNs. The\nNDT models these datasets as well as state-of-the-art recurrent models.\nFurther, its non-recurrence enables 3.9ms inference, well within the loop time\nof real-time applications and more than 6 times faster than recurrent baselines\non the monkey reaching dataset.

In general, the new\ninformation is smaller than the latter in the sense of Loewner partial\nordering. A sandwich estimator of covariance matrix is developed based on the\nobserved information of incomplete data and a consistent estimator of\ncomplete-data information matrix. The observed information simplifies\ncalculation of conditional expectation of outer product of the complete-data\nscore function appeared in the Louis (1982) general matrix formula.

Moreover, it does not involve the inverse observed Fisher\ninformation of incomplete data which therefore notably gives an appealing\nfeature for application. Recursive algorithms for the MLE and the sandwich\nestimator of covariance matrix are presented. Application to parameter\nestimation of regime switching conditional Markov jump process is considered to\nverify the results. The simulation study confirms that the MLEs are accurate\nand consistent having asymptotic normality.

Assessment of cerebral microbleeds is mostly performed by visual\ninspection. The past decade has seen the rise of semi-automatic tools to assist\nwith rating and more recently fully automatic tools for microbleed detection.\nIn this work, we explore the use of nnU-Net as a fully automated tool for\nmicrobleed segmentation. Data was provided by the ``Where is VALDO?'' challenge\nof MICCAI 2021. The final method consists of nnU-Net in the ``3D full\nresolution U-Net'' configuration trained on all data (fold = `all'). No\npost-processing options of nnU-Net were used. Self-evaluation on the training\ndata showed an estimated Dice of 0.80, false discovery rate of 0.16, and false\nnegative rate of 0.15. Final evaluation on the test set of the VALDO challenge\nis pending. Visual inspection of the results showed that most of the reported\nfalse positives could be an actual microbleed that might have been missed\nduring visual rating.

    "abstract": "We propose Region-wise (RW) loss for biomedical image segmentation.\nRegion-wise loss is versatile, can simultaneously account for class imbalance\nand pixel importance, and it can be easily implemented as the pixel-wise\nmultiplication between the softmax output and a RW map. We show that, under the\nproposed Region-wise loss framework, certain loss functions, such as Active\nContour and Boundary loss, can be reformulated similarly with appropriate RW\nmaps, thus revealing their underlying similarities and a new perspective to\nunderstand these loss functions. We investigate the observed optimization\ninstability caused by certain RW maps, such as Boundary loss distance maps, and\nwe introduce a mathematically-grounded principle to avoid such instability.\nThis principle provides excellent adaptability to any dataset and practically\nensures convergence without extra regularization terms or optimization tricks.\nFollowing this principle, we propose a simple version of boundary distance maps\ncalled rectified RW maps that, as we demonstrate in our experiments, achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance with similar or better Dice coefficients and\nHausdorff distances than Dice, Focal, and Boundary losses in three distinct\nsegmentation tasks. We quantify the optimization instability provided by\nBoundary loss distance maps, and we empirically show that our rectified RW maps\nare stable to optimize.

Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that ghosting artifacts caused\nby large foreground motion are mainly low-frequency signals and the details are\nmainly high-frequency signals. In this work, we propose a novel\nfrequency-guided end-to-end deep neural network (FHDRNet) to conduct HDR fusion\nin the frequency domain, and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to\ndecompose inputs into different frequency bands. The low-frequency signals are\nused to avoid specific ghosting artifacts, while the high-frequency signals are\nused for preserving details. Using a U-Net as the backbone, we propose two\nnovel modules: merging module and frequency-guided upsampling module. The\nmerging module applies the attention mechanism to the low-frequency components\nto deal with the ghost caused by large foreground motion. The frequency-guided\nupsampling module reconstructs details from multiple frequency-specific\ncomponents with rich details. In addition, a new RAW dataset is created for\ntraining and evaluating multi-frame HDR imaging algorithms in the RAW domain.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on public datasets and our RAW dataset,\nshowing that the proposed FHDRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

At present, the methods for detecting coronary artery stenoses\nand evaluating the degree of it in coronary angiograms are either subjective or\nnot efficient enough. Two vascular stenoses detection methods in coronary\nangiograms are proposed to assist the diagnosis. The first one is an automatic\nmethod, which can automatically segment the entire coronary vessels and mark\nthe stenoses. The second one is an interactive method. With this method, the\nuser only needs to give a start point and an end point to detect the stenoses\nof a certain vascular segment.

The automatic\ndetection method can effectively measure the diameter of the vessel and mark\nthe stenoses in different angiograms. Further investigation proves that the\nresults of interactive detection method can accurately reflect the true\nstenoses situation. The proposed automatic method and interactive method are\neffective in various angiograms and can complement each other in clinical\npractice.

However,\nthese two modules have been treated as two stand-alone components, which makes\nit difficult to achieve a global system optimality. In this paper, we propose a\ndeep learning-based approach that directly optimizes the beamformers at the\nbase station according to the received uplink pilots, thereby, bypassing the\nexplicit channel estimation. Different from the existing fully data-driven\napproach where all the modules are replaced by deep neural networks (DNNs), a\nneural calibration method is proposed to improve the scalability of the\nend-to-end design. In particular, the backbone of conventional time-efficient\nalgorithms, i.e., the least-squares (LS) channel estimator and the zero-forcing\n(ZF) beamformer, is preserved and DNNs are leveraged to calibrate their inputs\nfor better performance. The permutation equivariance property of the formulated\nresource allocation problem is then identified to design a low-complexity\nneural network architecture.

    "abstract": "In 1943, Hadwiger conjectured that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is\n$(t-1)$-colorable for every $t\\ge 1$. In the 1980s, Kostochka and Thomason\nindependently proved that every graph with no $K_t$ minor has average degree\n$O(t\\sqrt{\\log t})$ and hence is $O(t\\sqrt{\\log t})$-colorable. Recently,\nNorin, Song and the second author showed that every graph with no $K_t$ minor\nis $O(t(\\log t)^{\\beta})$-colorable for every $\\beta > 1/4$, making the first\nimprovement on the order of magnitude of the $O(t\\sqrt{\\log t})$ bound. More\nrecently, the second author showed they are $O(t (\\log \\log t)^{6})$-colorable.\nOur main technical result is that the chromatic number of a $K_t$-minor-free\ngraph is bounded by $O(t(1+f(G,t))$ where $f(G,t)$ is the maximum of\n$\\frac{\\chi(H)}{a}$ over all $a\\ge \\frac{t}{\\sqrt{\\log t}}$ and\n$K_a$-minor-free subgraphs $H$ of $G$ that are small (i.e. $O(a\\log^4 a)$\nvertices). This has a number of interesting corollaries. First, it shows that\nproving Linear Hadwiger's Conjecture (that $K_t$-minor-free graphs are\n$O(t)$-colorable) reduces to proving it for small graphs. Second, using the\ncurrent best-known bounds on coloring small $K_t$-minor-free graphs, we show\nthat $K_t$-minor-free graphs are $O(t\\log\\log t)$-colorable. Third, we prove\nthat $K_t$-minor-free graphs with clique number at most $\\sqrt{\\log t}/ (\\log\n\\log t)^2$ are $O(t)$-colorable. This implies our final corollary that Linear\nHadwiger's Conjecture holds for $K_r$-free graphs for any fixed $r$ and\nsufficiently large $t$; more specifically, there exists $C\\ge 1$ such that for\nevery $r\\ge 1$, there exists $t_r$ such that for all $t\\ge t_r$, every\n$K_r$-free $K_t$-minor-free graph is $Ct$-colorable.\nOne key to proving the main theorem is a new standalone result that every\n$K_t$-minor-free graph of average degree $d=\\Omega(t)$ has a subgraph on $O(d\n\\log^3 t)$ vertices with average degree $\\Omega(d)$.",

    "title": "Image Augmentation Using a Task Guided Generative Adversarial Network  for Age Estimation on Brain MRI",
    "abstract": "Brain age estimation based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an active\nresearch area in early diagnosis of some neurodegenerative diseases (e.g.\nAlzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, etc.) for elderly people or brain\nunderdevelopment for the young group. Deep learning methods have achieved the\nstate-of-the-art performance in many medical image analysis tasks, including\nbrain age estimation. However, the performance and generalisability of the deep\nlearning model are highly dependent on the quantity and quality of the training\ndata set. Both collecting and annotating brain MRI data are extremely\ntime-consuming. In this paper, to overcome the data scarcity problem, we\npropose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based image synthesis method.\nDifferent from the existing GAN-based methods, we integrate a task-guided\nbranch (a regression model for age estimation) to the end of the generator in\nGAN. By adding a task-guided loss to the conventional GAN loss, the learned\nlow-dimensional latent space and the synthesised images are more task-specific.\nIt helps to boost the performance of the down-stream task by combining the\nsynthesised images and real images for model training. The proposed method was\nevaluated on a public brain MRI data set for age estimation. Our proposed\nmethod outperformed (statistically significant) a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork based regression model and the GAN-based image synthesis method without\nthe task-guided branch. More importantly, it enables the identification of\nage-related brain regions in the image space. The code is available on GitHub\n(https://github.com/ruizhe-l/tgb-gan).",
