    "abstract": "Simulating physical systems is a core component of scientific computing,\nencompassing a wide range of physical domains and applications. Recently, there\nhas been a surge in data-driven methods to complement traditional numerical\nsimulations methods, motivated by the opportunity to reduce computational costs\nand/or learn new physical models leveraging access to large collections of\ndata. However, the diversity of problem settings and applications has led to a\nplethora of approaches, each one evaluated on a different setup and with\ndifferent evaluation metrics. We introduce a set of benchmark problems to take\na step towards unified benchmarks and evaluation protocols. We propose four\nrepresentative physical systems, as well as a collection of both widely used\nclassical time integrators and representative data-driven methods\n(kernel-based, MLP, CNN, nearest neighbors). Our framework allows evaluating\nobjectively and systematically the stability, accuracy, and computational\nefficiency of data-driven methods. Additionally, it is configurable to permit\nadjustments for accommodating other learning tasks and for establishing a\nfoundation for future developments in machine learning for scientific\ncomputing.",

    "abstract": "Credit scoring models, which are among the most potent risk management tools\nthat banks and financial institutes rely on, have been a popular subject for\nresearch in the past few decades. Accordingly, many approaches have been\ndeveloped to address the challenges in classifying loan applicants and improve\nand facilitate decision-making. The imbalanced nature of credit scoring\ndatasets, as well as the heterogeneous nature of features in credit scoring\ndatasets, pose difficulties in developing and implementing effective credit\nscoring models, targeting the generalization power of classification models on\nunseen data. In this paper, we propose the Bagging Supervised Autoencoder\nClassifier (BSAC) that mainly leverages the superior performance of the\nSupervised Autoencoder, which learns low-dimensional embeddings of the input\ndata exclusively with regards to the ultimate classification task of credit\nscoring, based on the principles of multi-task learning. BSAC also addresses\nthe data imbalance problem by employing a variant of the Bagging process based\non the undersampling of the majority class. The obtained results from our\nexperiments on the benchmark and real-life credit scoring datasets illustrate\nthe robustness and effectiveness of the Bagging Supervised Autoencoder\nClassifier in the classification of loan applicants that can be regarded as a\npositive development in credit scoring models.",

While the underlying digital infrastructure of AI systems is\ndeveloping rapidly, each area of implementation is subject to different degrees\nand processes of legitimization. By combining elements from institutional\ntheory and information systems-theory, this paper presents a conceptual\nframework to analyze and understand AI-induced field-change. The introduction\nof novel AI-agents into new or existing fields creates a dynamic in which\nalgorithms (re)shape organizations and institutions while existing\ninstitutional infrastructures determine the scope and speed at which\norganizational change is allowed to occur. Where institutional infrastructure\nand governance arrangements, such as standards, rules, and regulations, still\nare unelaborate, the field can move fast but is also more likely to be\ncontested. The institutional infrastructure surrounding AI-induced fields is\ngenerally little elaborated, which could be an obstacle to the broader\ninstitutionalization of AI-systems going forward.",

This model treats synchronous operations as\nfirst-class values (called $\\texttt{Events}$) akin to the treatment of\nfirst-class functions in functional languages. This primarily allows the\nprogrammer to compose and tailor their own concurrency abstractions and,\nadditionally, abstracts away unsafe memory operations, common in shared-memory\nconcurrency models, thereby making microcontroller programs safer, composable\nand easier-to-maintain.\nOur VM is made portable via a low-level $\\textit{bridge}$ interface, built\natop the embedded OS - Zephyr.

An important example is distributed momentum-SGD where temporal\ncorrelation is enhanced by the low-pass-filtering effect of applying momentum.\nIn this paper we design and analyze compression methods that exploit temporal\ncorrelation in systems both with and without error-feedback.

    "abstract": "Fast charging of lithium-ion batteries is crucial to increase desirability\nfor consumers and hence accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles. A major\nbarrier to shorter charge times is the accelerated aging of the battery at\nhigher charging rates, which can be driven by lithium plating, increased solid\nelectrolyte interphase growth due to elevated temperatures, and particle\ncracking due to mechanical stress. Lithium plating depends on the overpotential\nof the negative electrode, and mechanical stress depends on the concentration\ngradient, both of which cannot be measured directly. Techniques based on\nphysics-based models of the battery and optimal control algorithms have been\ndeveloped to this end. While these methods show promise in reducing\ndegradation, their optimization algorithms' complexity can limit their\nimplementation. In this paper, we present a method based on the constant\ncurrent constant voltage (CC-CV) charging scheme, called CC-CV$\\eta \\sigma$T\n(VEST). The new approach is simpler to implement and can be used with any model\nto impose varying levels of constraints on variables pertinent to degradation,\nsuch as plating potential and mechanical stress. We demonstrate the new\nCC-CV$\\eta \\sigma$T charging using an electrochemical model with mechanical and\nthermal effects included. Furthermore, we discuss how uncertainties can be\naccounted for by considering safety margins for the plating and stress\nconstraints.",

    "abstract": "Existing salient object detection (SOD) models mainly rely on CNN-based\nU-shaped structures with skip connections to combine the global contexts and\nlocal spatial details that are crucial for locating salient objects and\nrefining object details, respectively. Despite great successes, the ability of\nCNN in learning global contexts is limited. Recently, the vision transformer\nhas achieved revolutionary progress in computer vision owing to its powerful\nmodeling of global dependencies. However, directly applying the transformer to\nSOD is obviously suboptimal because the transformer lacks the ability to learn\nlocal spatial representations. To this end, this paper explores the combination\nof transformer and CNN to learn both global and local representations for SOD.\nWe propose a transformer-based Asymmetric Bilateral U-Net (AbiU-Net). The\nasymmetric bilateral encoder has a transformer path and a lightweight CNN path,\nwhere the two paths communicate at each encoder stage to learn complementary\nglobal contexts and local spatial details, respectively. The asymmetric\nbilateral decoder also consists of two paths to process features from the\ntransformer and CNN encoder paths, with communication at each decoder stage for\ndecoding coarse salient object locations and find-grained object details,\nrespectively. Such communication between the two encoder/decoder paths enables\nAbiU-Net to learn complementary global and local representations, taking\nadvantage of the natural properties of transformer and CNN, respectively.\nHence, ABiU-Net provides a new perspective for transformer-based SOD.

    "abstract": "Realizing today's cloud-level artificial intelligence functionalities\ndirectly on devices distributed at the edge of the internet calls for edge\nhardware capable of processing multiple modalities of sensory data (e.g. video,\naudio) at unprecedented energy-efficiency. AI hardware architectures today\ncannot meet the demand due to a fundamental \"memory wall\": data movement\nbetween separate compute and memory units consumes large energy and incurs long\nlatency. Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) based compute-in-memory (CIM)\narchitectures promise to bring orders of magnitude energy-efficiency\nimprovement by performing computation directly within memory. However,\nconventional approaches to CIM hardware design limit its functional flexibility\nnecessary for processing diverse AI workloads, and must overcome hardware\nimperfections that degrade inference accuracy. Such trade-offs between\nefficiency, versatility and accuracy cannot be addressed by isolated\nimprovements on any single level of the design. By co-optimizing across all\nhierarchies of the design from algorithms and architecture to circuits and\ndevices, we present NeuRRAM - the first multimodal edge AI chip using RRAM CIM\nto simultaneously deliver a high degree of versatility for diverse model\narchitectures, record energy-efficiency $5\\times$ - $8\\times$ better than prior\nart across various computational bit-precisions, and inference accuracy\ncomparable to software models with 4-bit weights on all measured standard AI\nbenchmarks including accuracy of 99.0% on MNIST and 85.7% on CIFAR-10 image\nclassification, 84.7% accuracy on Google speech command recognition, and a 70%\nreduction in image reconstruction error on a Bayesian image recovery task.

Following this demonstration, we show the real world impact of these\nfindings by applying them to two applications. First, we propose a simple yet\neffective data augmentation strategy and loss function which improves the\ntranslation invariance of a CNN's output. Second, we propose a method to\nefficiently determine which channels in the latent representation are\nresponsible for (i) encoding overall position information or (ii)\nregion-specific positions. We first show that semantic segmentation has a\nsignificant reliance on the overall position channels to make predictions. We\nthen show for the first time that it is possible to perform a `region-specific'\nattack, and degrade a network's performance in a particular part of the input.\nWe believe our findings and demonstrated applications will benefit research\nareas concerned with understanding the characteristics of CNNs.",

In this paper, we study the virality of\nanimated GIFs by analyzing over 10 months of complete data logs (more than 1B\nposts and 12B reblogs) on Tumblr, one of the largest repositories of animated\nGIFs on the Internet. We conduct a series of quantitative and comparative\nstudies on Tumblr data, comparing major types of online content -- text,\nimages, videos, and animated GIFs. We report on a number of interesting, new\nfindings on animated GIFs. We show that people tend to make animated GIFs\neasily searchable and discoverable by adding more hashtags than other content\ntypes. We also show that animated GIFs tend to go more viral than images and\nvideos on Tumblr. With more in-depth analysis, we present that animated GIFs\ntend to get reblogged more and followed more from non-followers, while animated\nGIFs have more recurrence of a post.

This paper presents our novel approach for\naffect-aware unsupervised Deep Belief Networks (DBN) to learn discriminative\nrepresentations of deceptive and truthful behavior. Drawing on psychology\ntheories that link affect and deception, we experimented with unimodal and\nmultimodal DBN-based approaches trained on facial valence, facial arousal,\naudio, and visual features. In addition to using facial affect as a feature on\nwhich DBN models are trained, we also introduce a DBN training procedure that\nuses facial affect as an aligner of audio-visual representations. We conducted\nclassification experiments with unsupervised Gaussian Mixture Model clustering\nto evaluate our approaches. Our best unsupervised approach (trained on facial\nvalence and visual features) achieved an AUC of 80%, outperforming human\nability and performing comparably to fully-supervised models.

Our paper presents an empirical\ntesting of AV simulator system that combines the SVL simulator and the Apollo\nplatform. We propose 576 test cases which are inspired by four naturalistic\ndriving situations with pedestrians and surrounding cars. We found that the SVL\ncan imitate realistic safe and collision situations; and at the same time,\nApollo can drive the car quite safely. On the other hand, we noted that the\nsystem failed to detect pedestrians or vehicles on the road in three out of\nfour classes, accounting for 10.0% total number of scenarios tested. We further\napplied metamorphic testing to identify inconsistencies in the system with\nadditional 486 test cases. We then discussed some insights into the scenarios\nthat may cause hazardous situations in real life.

    "abstract": "Machine learning is disruptive. At the same time, machine learning can only\nsucceed by collaboration among many parties in multiple steps naturally as\npipelines in an eco-system, such as collecting data for possible machine\nlearning applications, collaboratively training models by multiple parties and\ndelivering machine learning services to end users. Data is critical and\npenetrating in the whole machine learning pipelines. As machine learning\npipelines involve many parties and, in order to be successful, have to form a\nconstructive and dynamic eco-system, marketplaces and data pricing are\nfundamental in connecting and facilitating those many parties. In this article,\nwe survey the principles and the latest research development of data pricing in\nmachine learning pipelines. We start with a brief review of data marketplaces\nand pricing desiderata. Then, we focus on pricing in three important steps in\nmachine learning pipelines. To understand pricing in the step of training data\ncollection, we review pricing raw data sets and data labels. We also\ninvestigate pricing in the step of collaborative training of machine learning\nmodels, and overview pricing machine learning models for end users in the step\nof machine learning deployment. We also discuss a series of possible future\ndirections.",

    "title": "Activity Recognition for Autism Diagnosis",
    "abstract": "A formal autism diagnosis is an inefficient and lengthy process. Families\noften have to wait years before receiving a diagnosis for their child; some may\nnot receive one at all due to this delay. One approach to this problem is to\nuse digital technologies to detect the presence of behaviors related to autism,\nwhich in aggregate may lead to remote and automated diagnostics. One of the\nstrongest indicators of autism is stimming, which is a set of repetitive,\nself-stimulatory behaviors such as hand flapping, headbanging, and spinning.\nUsing computer vision to detect hand flapping is especially difficult due to\nthe sparsity of public training data in this space and excessive shakiness and\nmotion in such data. Our work demonstrates a novel method that overcomes these\nissues: we use hand landmark detection over time as a feature representation\nwhich is then fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. We achieve a\nvalidation accuracy and F1 Score of about 72% on detecting whether videos from\nthe Self-Stimulatory Behaviour Dataset (SSBD) contain hand flapping or not. Our\nbest model also predicts accurately on external videos we recorded of ourselves\noutside of the dataset it was trained on. This model uses less than 26,000\nparameters, providing promise for fast deployment into ubiquitous and wearable\ndigital settings for a remote autism diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Deep face recognition (FR) has achieved significantly high accuracy on\nseveral challenging datasets and fosters successful real-world applications,\neven showing high robustness to the illumination variation that is usually\nregarded as a main threat to the FR system. However, in the real world,\nillumination variation caused by diverse lighting conditions cannot be fully\ncovered by the limited face dataset. In this paper, we study the threat of\nlighting against FR from a new angle, i.e., adversarial attack, and identify a\nnew task, i.e., adversarial relighting. Given a face image, adversarial\nrelighting aims to produce a naturally relighted counterpart while fooling the\nstate-of-the-art deep FR methods. To this end, we first propose the physical\nmodel-based adversarial relighting attack (ARA) denoted as\nalbedo-quotient-based adversarial relighting attack (AQ-ARA). It generates\nnatural adversarial light under the physical lighting model and guidance of FR\nsystems and synthesizes adversarially relighted face images. Moreover, we\npropose the auto-predictive adversarial relighting attack (AP-ARA) by training\nan adversarial relighting network (ARNet) to automatically predict the\nadversarial light in a one-step manner according to different input faces,\nallowing efficiency-sensitive applications. More importantly, we propose to\ntransfer the above digital attacks to physical ARA (Phy-ARA) through a precise\nrelighting device, making the estimated adversarial lighting condition\nreproducible in the real world. We validate our methods on three\nstate-of-the-art deep FR methods, i.e., FaceNet, ArcFace, and CosFace, on two\npublic datasets. The extensive and insightful results demonstrate our work can\ngenerate realistic adversarial relighted face images fooling FR easily,\nrevealing the threat of specific light directions and strengths.",

We propose the concept of benefit graph which describes how each\nclient can benefit from collaborating with other clients and develop a Pareto\noptimization approach to obtain it.

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are typically trained to synthesize\ndata, from images and more recently tabular data, under the assumption of\ndirectly accessible training data. Recently, federated learning (FL) is an\nemerging paradigm that features decentralized learning on client's local data\nwith a privacy-preserving capability. And, while learning GANs to synthesize\nimages on FL systems has just been demonstrated, it is unknown if GANs for\ntabular data can be learned from decentralized data sources. Moreover, it\nremains unclear which distributed architecture suits them best. Different from\nimage GANs, state-of-the-art tabular GANs require prior knowledge on the data\ndistribution of each (discrete and continuous) column to agree on a common\nencoding -- risking privacy guarantees. In this paper, we propose Fed-TGAN, the\nfirst Federated learning framework for Tabular GANs. To effectively learn a\ncomplex tabular GAN on non-identical participants, Fed-TGAN designs two novel\nfeatures: (i) a privacy-preserving multi-source feature encoding for model\ninitialization; and (ii) table similarity aware weighting strategies to\naggregate local models for countering data skew. We extensively evaluate the\nproposed Fed-TGAN against variants of decentralized learning architectures on\nfour widely used datasets. Results show that Fed-TGAN accelerates training time\nper epoch up to 200% compared to the alternative architectures, for both IID\nand Non-IID data. Overall, Fed-TGAN not only stabilizes the training loss, but\nalso achieves better similarity between generated and original data.",

In addition, a\nlarge amount of unlabeled data is available in both source and target domains,\nbut labeling each of them is difficult, expensive, time-consuming, and sometime\nunnecessary. Therefore, it is very important and worthwhile to fully explore\nthe labeled and unlabeled data in source and target domains to settle the task\nin target domain. In this paper, a new semi-supervised inductive transfer\nlearning framework, named \\emph{Co-Transfer} is proposed. Co-Transfer first\ngenerates three TrAdaBoost classifiers for transfer learning from the source\ndomain to the target domain, and meanwhile another three TrAdaBoost classifiers\nare generated for transfer learning from the target domain to the source\ndomain, using bootstraped samples from the original labeled data. In each round\nof co-transfer, each group of TrAdaBoost classifiers are refined using the\ncarefully labeled data.

Federated learning provides a privacy-preserving way to train\nthese models without requiring centralization of user data. However, federated\ndeep retrieval models usually perform much worse than their centralized\ncounterparts due to non-IID (independent and identically distributed) training\ndata on clients, an intrinsic property of federated learning that limits\nnegatives available for training.

A\npersonalized chatbot is designed as a digital chatting assistant for a user.\nThe key characteristic of a personalized chatbot is that it should have a\nconsistent personality with the corresponding user. It can talk the same way as\nthe user when it is delegated to respond to others' messages. We present a\nretrieval-based personalized chatbot model, namely IMPChat, to learn an\nimplicit user profile from the user's dialogue history. We argue that the\nimplicit user profile is superior to the explicit user profile regarding\naccessibility and flexibility. IMPChat aims to learn an implicit user profile\nthrough modeling user's personalized language style and personalized\npreferences separately. To learn a user's personalized language style, we\nelaborately build language models from shallow to deep using the user's\nhistorical responses; To model a user's personalized preferences, we explore\nthe conditional relations underneath each post-response pair of the user. The\npersonalized preferences are dynamic and context-aware: we assign higher\nweights to those historical pairs that are topically related to the current\nquery when aggregating the personalized preferences. We match each response\ncandidate with the personalized language style and personalized preference,\nrespectively, and fuse the two matching signals to determine the final ranking\nscore.

    "abstract": "Most of stereo vision works are focusing on computing the dense pixel\ndisparity of a given pair of left and right images. A camera pair usually\nrequired lens undistortion and stereo calibration to provide an undistorted\nepipolar line calibrated image pair for accurate dense pixel disparity\ncomputation. Due to noise, object occlusion, repetitive or lack of texture and\nlimitation of matching algorithms, the pixel disparity accuracy usually suffers\nthe most at those object boundary areas. Although statistically the total\nnumber of pixel disparity errors might be low (under 2% according to the Kitti\nVision Benchmark of current top ranking algorithms), the percentage of these\ndisparity errors at object boundaries are very high. This renders the\nsubsequence 3D object distance detection with much lower accuracy than desired.\nThis paper proposed a different approach for solving a 3D object distance\ndetection by detecting object disparity directly without going through a dense\npixel disparity computation. An example squeezenet Object Disparity-SSD\n(OD-SSD) was constructed to demonstrate an efficient object disparity detection\nwith comparable accuracy compared with Kitti dataset pixel disparity ground\ntruth. Further training and testing results with mixed image dataset captured\nby several different stereo systems may suggest that an OD-SSD might be\nagnostic to stereo system parameters such as a baseline, FOV, lens distortion,\neven left/right camera epipolar line misalignment.",

To this end, we first identify the main RIS\npower-consuming components and introduce a suitable power-consumption model.\nSubsequently, we introduce a novel RIS power-splitting architecture that\nenables simultaneous energy harvesting and beamsteering. Specifically, a subset\nof the RIS unit cells (UCs) is used for beamsteering while the remaining ones\nabsorb energy. For the subset allocation, we propose policies obtained as\nsolutions to two optimization problems. The first problem aims at maximizing\nthe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver without violating the RIS's\nenergy harvesting demands. Additionally, the objective of the second problem is\nto maximize the RIS harvested power, while ensuring an acceptable SNR at the\nreceiver. We prove that under particular propagation conditions, some of the\nproposed policies deliver the optimal solution of the two problems.\nFurthermore, we report numerical results that reveal the efficiency of the\npolicies with respect to the optimal and very high-complexity brute-force\ndesign approach. Finally, through a case study of user tracking, we showcase\nthat the RIS power-consumption demands can be secured by harvesting energy from\ninformation signals.",

We point out that the ID task has an\nimplicit semantic consistency (SC) assumption, which may not hold in\nunconstrained datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive mask\nprediction (CMP) task for visual representation learning and design a mask\ncontrast (MaskCo) framework to implement the idea. MaskCo contrasts\nregion-level features instead of view-level features, which makes it possible\nto identify the positive sample without any assumptions. To solve the domain\ngap between masked and unmasked features, we design a dedicated mask prediction\nhead in MaskCo. This module is shown to be the key to the success of the CMP.\nWe evaluated MaskCo on training datasets beyond ImageNet and compare its\nperformance with MoCo V2. Results show that MaskCo achieves comparable\nperformance with MoCo V2 using ImageNet training dataset, but demonstrates a\nstronger performance across a range of downstream tasks when COCO or Conceptual\nCaptions are used for training.

    "abstract": "With the recent success of deep neural networks, remarkable progress has been\nachieved on face recognition. However, collecting large-scale real-world\ntraining data for face recognition has turned out to be challenging, especially\ndue to the label noise and privacy issues. Meanwhile, existing face recognition\ndatasets are usually collected from web images, lacking detailed annotations on\nattributes (e.g., pose and expression), so the influences of different\nattributes on face recognition have been poorly investigated. In this paper, we\naddress the above-mentioned issues in face recognition using synthetic face\nimages, i.e., SynFace. Specifically, we first explore the performance gap\nbetween recent state-of-the-art face recognition models trained with synthetic\nand real face images. We then analyze the underlying causes behind the\nperformance gap, e.g., the poor intra-class variations and the domain gap\nbetween synthetic and real face images. Inspired by this, we devise the SynFace\nwith identity mixup (IM) and domain mixup (DM) to mitigate the above\nperformance gap, demonstrating the great potentials of synthetic data for face\nrecognition. Furthermore, with the controllable face synthesis model, we can\neasily manage different factors of synthetic face generation, including pose,\nexpression, illumination, the number of identities, and samples per identity.\nTherefore, we also perform a systematically empirical analysis on synthetic\nface images to provide some insights on how to effectively utilize synthetic\ndata for face recognition.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are an attractive tool for compressing the control\npolicy lookup tables in systems such as the Airborne Collision Avoidance System\n(ACAS). It is vital to ensure the safety of such neural controllers via\nverification techniques. The problem of analyzing ACAS Xu networks has\nmotivated many successful neural network verifiers. These verifiers typically\nanalyze the internal computation of neural networks to decide whether a\nproperty regarding the input/output holds. The intrinsic complexity of neural\nnetwork computation renders such verifiers slow to run and vulnerable to\nfloating-point error.\nThis paper revisits the original problem of verifying ACAS Xu networks. The\nnetworks take low-dimensional sensory inputs with training data provided by a\nprecomputed lookup table. We propose to prepend an input quantization layer to\nthe network. Quantization allows efficient verification via input state\nenumeration, whose complexity is bounded by the size of the quantization space.\nQuantization is equivalent to nearest-neighbor interpolation at run time, which\nhas been shown to provide acceptable accuracy for ACAS in simulation. Moreover,\nour technique can deliver exact verification results immune to floating-point\nerror if we directly enumerate the network outputs on the target inference\nimplementation or on an accurate simulation of the target implementation.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial training is one effective approach for training robust deep\nneural networks against adversarial attacks. While being able to bring reliable\nrobustness, adversarial training (AT) methods in general favor high capacity\nmodels, i.e., the larger the model the better the robustness. This tends to\nlimit their effectiveness on small models, which are more preferable in\nscenarios where storage or computing resources are very limited (e.g., mobile\ndevices). In this paper, we leverage the concept of knowledge distillation to\nimprove the robustness of small models by distilling from adversarially trained\nlarge models. We first revisit several state-of-the-art AT methods from a\ndistillation perspective and identify one common technique that can lead to\nimproved robustness: the use of robust soft labels -- predictions of a robust\nmodel. Following this observation, we propose a novel adversarial robustness\ndistillation method called Robust Soft Label Adversarial Distillation (RSLAD)\nto train robust small student models. RSLAD fully exploits the robust soft\nlabels produced by a robust (adversarially-trained) large teacher model to\nguide the student's learning on both natural and adversarial examples in all\nloss terms. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our RSLAD approach\nover existing adversarial training and distillation methods in improving the\nrobustness of small models against state-of-the-art attacks including the\nAutoAttack.

    "abstract": "Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) and Cross-System Recommendation (CSR) have\nbeen proposed to improve the recommendation accuracy in a target dataset\n(domain/system) with the help of a source one with relatively richer\ninformation. However, most existing CDR and CSR approaches are single-target,\nnamely, there is a single target dataset, which can only help the target\ndataset and thus cannot benefit the source dataset. In this paper, we focus on\nthree new scenarios, i.e., Dual-Target CDR (DTCDR), Multi-Target CDR (MTCDR),\nand CDR+CSR, and aim to improve the recommendation accuracy in all datasets\nsimultaneously for all scenarios. To do this, we propose a unified framework,\ncalled GA (based on Graph embedding and Attention techniques), for all three\nscenarios. In GA, we first construct separate heterogeneous graphs to generate\nmore representative user and item embeddings. Then, we propose an element-wise\nattention mechanism to effectively combine the embeddings of common entities\n(users/items) learned from different datasets. Moreover, to avoid negative\ntransfer, we further propose a Personalized training strategy to minimize the\nembedding difference of common entities between a richer dataset and a sparser\ndataset, deriving three new models, i.e., GA-DTCDR-P, GA-MTCDR-P, and\nGA-CDR+CSR-P, for the three scenarios respectively.

    "abstract": "Domain shift happens in cross-domain scenarios commonly because of the wide\ngaps between different domains: when applying a deep learning model\nwell-trained in one domain to another target domain, the model usually performs\npoorly. To tackle this problem, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques\nare proposed to bridge the gap between different domains, for the purpose of\nimproving model performance without annotation in the target domain.\nParticularly, UDA has a great value for multimodal medical image analysis,\nwhere annotation difficulty is a practical concern. However, most existing UDA\nmethods can only achieve satisfactory improvements in one adaptation direction\n(e.g., MRI to CT), but often perform poorly in the other (CT to MRI), limiting\ntheir practical usage. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional UDA (BiUDA)\nframework based on disentangled representation learning for equally competent\ntwo-way UDA performances. This framework employs a unified domain-aware pattern\nencoder which not only can adaptively encode images in different domains\nthrough a domain controller, but also improve model efficiency by eliminating\nredundant parameters. Furthermore, to avoid distortion of contents and patterns\nof input images during the adaptation process, a content-pattern consistency\nloss is introduced. Additionally, for better UDA segmentation performance, a\nlabel consistency strategy is proposed to provide extra supervision by\nrecomposing target-domain-styled images and corresponding source-domain\nannotations. Comparison experiments and ablation studies conducted on two\npublic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our BiUDA framework to current\nstate-of-the-art UDA methods and the effectiveness of its novel designs. By\nsuccessfully addressing two-way adaptations, our BiUDA framework offers a\nflexible solution of UDA techniques to the real-world scenario.",

    "abstract": "Approximate subgraph matching, which is an important primitive for many\napplications like question answering, community detection, and motif discovery,\noften involves large labeled graphs such as knowledge graphs, social networks,\nand protein sequences. Effective methods for extracting matching subgraphs, in\nterms of label and structural similarities to a query, should depict accuracy,\ncomputational efficiency, and robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose\nVerSaChI for finding the top-k most similar subgraphs based on 2-hop label and\nstructural overlap similarity with the query. The similarity is characterized\nusing Chebyshev's inequality to compute the chi-square statistical significance\nfor measuring the degree of matching of the subgraphs.

    "abstract": "Existing data-driven methods can well handle short text generation. However,\nwhen applied to the long-text generation scenarios such as story generation or\nadvertising text generation in the commercial scenario, these methods may\ngenerate illogical and uncontrollable texts. To address these aforementioned\nissues, we propose a graph-based grouping planner(GGP) following the idea of\nfirst-plan-then-generate. Specifically, given a collection of key phrases, GGP\nfirstly encodes these phrases into an instance-level sequential representation\nand a corpus-level graph-based representation separately. With these two\nsynergic representations, we then regroup these phrases into a fine-grained\nplan, based on which we generate the final long text. We conduct our\nexperiments on three long text generation datasets and the experimental results\nreveal that GGP significantly outperforms baselines, which proves that GGP can\ncontrol the long text generation by knowing how to say and in what order.",

To this end, we firstly propose to introduce a novel\nmulti-anchor based active learning strategy to assist domain adaptation\nregarding the semantic segmentation task. By innovatively adopting multiple\nanchors instead of a single centroid, the source domain can be better\ncharacterized as a multimodal distribution, thus more representative and\ncomplimentary samples are selected from the target domain. With little workload\nto manually annotate these active samples, the distortion of the target-domain\ndistribution can be effectively alleviated, resulting in a large performance\ngain. The multi-anchor strategy is additionally employed to model the\ntarget-distribution. By regularizing the latent representation of the target\nsamples compact around multiple anchors through a novel soft alignment loss,\nmore precise segmentation can be achieved.

To remedy\nthese issues, we propose a Sentiment-aware Interactive Fusion Network (SIFN)\nfor review-based item recommendation.

Then, we propose a sentiment prediction task\nthat guides the sentiment learner to extract sentiment-aware features via\nexplicit sentiment labels. Finally, we design a rating prediction task that\ncontains a rating learner with an interactive and fusion module to fuse the\nidentity (i.e., user and item ID) and each review representation so that\nvarious interactive features can synergistically influence the final rating\nscore.

Discrepancies between a declaration file and\nthe JavaScript implementation lead to incorrect feedback from the TypeScript\nIDE and, thus, to incorrect uses of the underlying JavaScript library.\nThis work presents dts-generate, a tool that generates TypeScript declaration\nfiles for JavaScript libraries uploaded to the NPM registry. It extracts code\nexamples from the documentation written by the developer, executes the library\ndriven by the examples, gathers run-time information, and generates a\ndeclaration file based on this information. To evaluate the tool, 249\ndeclaration files were generated directly from an NPM module and 111 of these\nwere compared with the corresponding declaration file provided on\nDefinitelyTyped. All these files either exhibited no differences at all or\ndifferences that can be resolved by extending the developer-provided examples.",

    "abstract": "As one of the most fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision,\nobject detection tries to locate object instances and find their categories in\nnatural images. The most important step in the evaluation of object detection\nalgorithm is calculating the intersection-over-union (IoU) between the\npredicted bounding box and the ground truth one. Although this procedure is\nwell-defined and solved for planar images, it is not easy for spherical image\nobject detection. Existing methods either compute the IoUs based on biased\nbounding box representations or make excessive approximations, thus would give\nincorrect results. In this paper, we first identify that spherical rectangles\nare unbiased bounding boxes for objects in spherical images, and then propose\nan analytical method for IoU calculation without any approximations. Based on\nthe unbiased representation and calculation, we also present an anchor free\nobject detection algorithm for spherical images. The experiments on two\nspherical object detection datasets show that the proposed method can achieve\nbetter performance than existing methods.",

    "abstract": "It is increasingly suggested to identify Software Vulnerabilities (SVs) in\ncode commits to give early warnings about potential security risks. However,\nthere is a lack of effort to assess vulnerability-contributing commits right\nafter they are detected to provide timely information about the exploitability,\nimpact and severity of SVs. Such information is important to plan and\nprioritize the mitigation for the identified SVs. We propose a novel Deep\nmulti-task learning model, DeepCVA, to automate seven Commit-level\nVulnerability Assessment tasks simultaneously based on Common Vulnerability\nScoring System (CVSS) metrics. We conduct large-scale experiments on 1,229\nvulnerability-contributing commits containing 542 different SVs in 246\nreal-world software projects to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of\nour model. We show that DeepCVA is the best-performing model with 38% to 59.8%\nhigher Matthews Correlation Coefficient than many supervised and unsupervised\nbaseline models. DeepCVA also requires 6.3 times less training and validation\ntime than seven cumulative assessment models, leading to significantly less\nmodel maintenance cost as well. Overall, DeepCVA presents the first effective\nand efficient solution to automatically assess SVs early in software systems.",

    "abstract": "Intent detection and slot filling are two main tasks in natural language\nunderstanding (NLU) for identifying users' needs from their utterances. These\ntwo tasks are highly related and often trained jointly. However, most previous\nworks assume that each utterance only corresponds to one intent, ignoring the\nfact that a user utterance in many cases could include multiple intents. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Self-Distillation Joint NLU model (SDJN) for\nmulti-intent NLU. First, we formulate multiple intent detection as a weakly\nsupervised problem and approach with multiple instance learning (MIL). Then, we\ndesign an auxiliary loop via self-distillation with three orderly arranged\ndecoders: Initial Slot Decoder, MIL Intent Decoder, and Final Slot Decoder. The\noutput of each decoder will serve as auxiliary information for the next\ndecoder. With the auxiliary knowledge provided by the MIL Intent Decoder, we\nset Final Slot Decoder as the teacher model that imparts knowledge back to\nInitial Slot Decoder to complete the loop. The auxiliary loop enables intents\nand slots to guide mutually in-depth and further boost the overall NLU\nperformance. Experimental results on two public multi-intent datasets indicate\nthat our model achieves strong performance compared to others.",

For axis-aligned squares and hypercubes, our result improves upon\nall (recently announced) previous works. We obtain, in particular, a dynamic\n$(4+\\epsilon)$-approximation for squares, with $O(\\log^4 n)$ worst-case update\ntime.\nOur result is obtained via a two-level approach. First, we develop a dynamic\ndata structure which stores all objects and provides an approximate independent\nset when queried, with output-sensitive running time. We show that via standard\nmethods such a structure can be used to obtain a dynamic algorithm with\n\\textit{amortized} update time bounds. Then, to obtain worst-case update time\nalgorithms, we develop a generic deamortization scheme that with each\ninsertion/deletion keeps (i) the update time bounded and (ii) the number of\nchanges in the independent set constant. We show that such a scheme is\napplicable to fat objects by showing an appropriate generalization of a\nseparator theorem.\nInterestingly, we show that our deamortization scheme is also necessary in\norder to obtain worst-case update bounds: If for a class of objects our scheme\nis not applicable, then no constant-factor approximation with sublinear\nworst-case update time is possible.

    "abstract": "Path planners based on basic rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) are quick\nand efficient, and thus favourable for real-time robot path planning, but are\nalmost-surely suboptimal. In contrast, the optimal RRT (RRT*) converges to the\noptimal solution, but may be expensive in practice. Recent work has focused on\naccelerating the RRT*'s convergence rate. The most successful strategies are\ninformed sampling, path optimisation, and a combination thereof. However, these\nacceleration methods have not been applied to the basic RRT. Moreover, while a\nnumber of path optimisers can be used to accelerate the convergence rate, a\ncomparison of their effectiveness is lacking. In this paper, we investigate the\nuse of informed sampling and path optimisation to accelerate planners based on\nboth the basic RRT and the RRT*, resulting in a family of algorithms known as\noptimised informed RRTs. We apply different path optimisers and compare their\neffectiveness. The goal is to ascertain if applying informed sampling and path\noptimisation can help the quick, though almost-surely suboptimal, path planners\nbased on the basic RRT attain comparable or better performance than RRT*-based\nplanners. Analyses show that RRT-based optimised informed RRTs do attain better\nperformance than their RRT*-based counterparts, both when planning time is\nlimited and when there is more planning time.",

    "abstract": "Object detection is a challenging task in remote sensing because objects only\noccupy a few pixels in the images, and the models are required to\nsimultaneously learn object locations and detection. Even though the\nestablished approaches well perform for the objects of regular sizes, they\nachieve weak performance when analyzing small ones or getting stuck in the\nlocal minima (e.g. false object parts). Two possible issues stand in their way.\nFirst, the existing methods struggle to perform stably on the detection of\nsmall objects because of the complicated background. Second, most of the\nstandard methods used hand-crafted features, and do not work well on the\ndetection of objects parts of which are missing. We here address the above\nissues and propose a new architecture with a multiple patch feature pyramid\nnetwork (MPFP-Net). Different from the current models that during training only\npursue the most discriminative patches, in MPFPNet the patches are divided into\nclass-affiliated subsets, in which the patches are related and based on the\nprimary loss function, a sequence of smooth loss functions are determined for\nthe subsets to improve the model for collecting small object parts. To enhance\nthe feature representation for patch selection, we introduce an effective\nmethod to regularize the residual values and make the fusion transition layers\nstrictly norm-preserving.

Computing minimal witnessing subsystems is NP-hard already\nfor acyclic Markov chains, but can be done in polynomial time for Markov chains\nwhose underlying graph is a tree. This paper considers the problem for\nprobabilistic systems that are similar to trees or paths. It introduces the\nparameters directed tree-partition width (dtpw) and directed path-partition\nwidth (dppw) and shows that computing minimal witnesses remains NP-hard for\nMarkov chains with bounded dppw (and hence also for Markov chains with bounded\ndtpw). By observing that graphs of bounded dtpw have bounded width with respect\nto all known tree similarity measures for directed graphs, the hardness result\ncarries over to these other tree similarity measures. Technically, the\nreduction proceeds via the conceptually simpler matrix-pair chain problem,\nwhich is introduced and shown to be NP-complete for nonnegative matrices of\nfixed dimension. Furthermore, an algorithm which aims to utilise a given\ndirected tree partition of the system to compute a minimal witnessing subsystem\nis described. It enumerates partial subsystems for the blocks of the partition\nalong the tree order, and keeps only necessary ones.

    "abstract": "Thom Fr\\\"uhwirth presented a short, elegant and efficient Prolog program for\nthe n queens problem. However the program may be seen as rather tricky and one\nmay not be convinced about its correctness. This paper explains the program in\na declarative way, and provides proofs of its correctness and completeness. The\nspecification and the proofs are declarative, i.e. they abstract from any\noperational semantics. The specification is approximate, it is unnecessary to\ndescribe the program's semantics exactly. Despite the program works on\nnon-ground terms, this work employs the standard semantics, based on logical\nconsequence and Herbrand interpretations.\nAnother purpose of the paper is to present an example of precise declarative\nreasoning about the semantics of a logic program.\nUnder consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).",

    "title": "Control Flow Versus Data Flow in Distributed Systems Integration:  Revival of Flow-Based Programming for the Industrial Internet of Things",
    "abstract": "When we consider the application layer of networked infrastructures, data and\ncontrol flow are important concerns in distributed systems integration.\nModularity is a fundamental principle in software design, in particular for\ndistributed system architectures. Modularity emphasizes high cohesion of\nindividual modules and low coupling between modules. Microservices are a recent\nmodularization approach with the specific requirements of independent\ndeployability and, in particular, decentralized data management. Cohesiveness\nof microservices goes hand-in-hand with loose coupling, making the development,\ndeployment, and evolution of microservice architectures flexible and scalable.\nHowever, in our experience with microservice architectures, interactions and\nflows among microservices are usually more complex than in traditional,\nmonolithic enterprise systems, since services tend to be smaller and only have\none responsibility, causing collaboration needs. We suggest that for loose\ncoupling among microservices, explicit control-flow modeling and execution with\ncentral workflow engines should be avoided on the application integration\nlevel. On the level of integrating microservices, data-flow modeling should be\ndominant. Control-flow should be secondary and preferably delegated to the\nmicroservices. We discuss coupling in distributed systems integration and\nreflect the history of business process modeling with respect to data and\ncontrol flow. To illustrate our recommendations, we present some results for\nflow-based programming in our Industrial DevOps project Titan, where we employ\nflow-based programming for the Industrial Internet of Things.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for generating bullet comments for\nlive-streaming games based on highlights (i.e., the exciting parts of video\nclips) extracted from the game content and evaluate the effect of mental health\npromotion. Game live streaming is becoming a popular theme for academic\nresearch. Compared to traditional online video sharing platforms, such as\nYoutube and Vimeo, video live streaming platform has the benefits of\ncommunicating with other viewers in real-time. In sports broadcasting, the\ncommentator plays an essential role as mood maker by making matches more\nexciting. The enjoyment emerged while watching game live streaming also\nbenefits the audience's mental health. However, many e-sports live streaming\nchannels do not have a commentator for entertaining viewers. Therefore, this\npaper presents a design of an AI commentator that can be embedded in live\nstreaming games. To generate bullet comments for real-time game live streaming,\nthe system employs highlight evaluation to detect the highlights, and generate\nthe bullet comments. An experiment is conducted and the effectiveness of\ngenerated bullet comments in a live-streaming fighting game channel is\nevaluated.",

    "abstract": "Entity Resolution (ER) aims to identify whether two tuples refer to the same\nreal-world entity and is well-known to be labor-intensive. It is a prerequisite\nto anomaly detection, as comparing the attribute values of two matched tuples\nfrom two different datasets provides one effective way to detect anomalies.\nExisting ER approaches, due to insufficient feature discovery or error-prone\ninherent characteristics, are not able to achieve stable performance. In this\npaper, we present CollaborER, a self-supervised entity resolution framework via\nmulti-features collaboration. It is capable of (i) obtaining reliable ER\nresults with zero human annotations and (ii) discovering adequate tuples'\nfeatures in a fault-tolerant manner. CollaborER consists of two phases, i.e.,\nautomatic label generation (ALG) and collaborative ER training (CERT). In the\nfirst phase, ALG is proposed to generate a set of positive tuple pairs and a\nset of negative tuple pairs. ALG guarantees the high quality of the generated\ntuples and hence ensures the training quality of the subsequent CERT. In the\nsecond phase, CERT is introduced to learn the matching signals by discovering\ngraph features and sentence features of tuples collaboratively. Extensive\nexperimental results over eight real-world ER benchmarks show that CollaborER\noutperforms all the existing unsupervised ER approaches and is comparable or\neven superior to the state-of-the-art supervised ER methods.",

Interestingly, preliminary results indicate that\nemojis do not always reduce commenting noise (i.e., eight out of 20 emoji\nreactions), providing evidence that developers use emojis with ulterior\nintentions. From a reviewing context, the extent to which emoji reactions\nfacilitate for a more efficient review process is unknown. Objective: In this\nregistered report, we introduce the study protocols to investigate ulterior\nintentions and usages of emoji reactions, apart from reducing commenting noise\nduring the discussions in GitHub pull requests (PRs). As part of the report, we\nfirst perform a preliminary analysis to whether emoji reactions can reduce\ncommenting noise in PRs and then introduce the execution plan for the study.\nMethod: We will use a mixed-methods approach in this study, i.e., quantitative\nand qualitative, with three hypotheses to test.",

However, they\nstill suffer from several inherent challenges including: modelling forgetting\nbehaviours and identifying relationships among latent concepts. To address\nthese challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel knowledge tracing model,\nnamely \\emph{Deep Graph Memory Network} (DGMN). In this model, we incorporate a\nforget gating mechanism into an attention memory structure in order to capture\nforgetting behaviours dynamically during the knowledge tracing process.\nParticularly, this forget gating mechanism is built upon attention forgetting\nfeatures over latent concepts considering their mutual dependencies. Further,\nthis model has the capability of learning relationships between latent concepts\nfrom a dynamic latent concept graph in light of a student's evolving knowledge\nstates. A comprehensive experimental evaluation has been conducted using four\nwell-established benchmark datasets. The results show that DGMN consistently\noutperforms the state-of-the-art KT models over all the datasets.

Till this day in the\nscientific literature there is in general no mathematical convergence analysis\nwhich explains the numerical success of GD type optimization schemes in the\ntraining of ANNs with ReLU activation. GD type optimization schemes can be\nregarded as temporal discretization methods for the gradient flow (GF)\ndifferential equations associated to the considered optimization problem and,\nin view of this, it seems to be a natural direction of research to first aim to\ndevelop a mathematical convergence theory for time-continuous GF differential\nequations and, thereafter, to aim to extend such a time-continuous convergence\ntheory to implementable time-discrete GD type optimization methods. In this\narticle we establish two basic results for GF differential equations in the\ntraining of fully-connected feedforward ANNs with one hidden layer and ReLU\nactivation. In the first main result of this article we establish in the\ntraining of such ANNs under the assumption that the probability distribution of\nthe input data of the considered supervised learning problem is absolutely\ncontinuous with a bounded density function that every GF differential equation\nadmits for every initial value a solution which is also unique among a suitable\nclass of solutions.

However, especially for the estimation of the position and size of\nfruits, it is necessary to avoid occlusions as much as possible and acquire\nsensor information of the relevant parts. Global viewpoint planners exist that\nsuggest a series of viewpoints to cover the regions of interest up to a certain\ndegree, but they usually prioritize global coverage and do not emphasize the\navoidance of local occlusions. On the other hand, there are approaches that aim\nat avoiding local occlusions, but they cannot be used in larger environments\nsince they only reach a local maximum of coverage. In this paper, we therefore\npropose to combine a local, gradient-based method with global viewpoint\nplanning to enable local occlusion avoidance while still being able to cover\nlarge areas. Our simulated experiments with a robotic arm equipped with a\ncamera array as well as an RGB-D camera show that this combination leads to a\nsignificantly increased coverage of the regions of interest compared to just\napplying global coverage planning.",

    "title": "Learning RAW-to-sRGB Mappings with Inaccurately Aligned Supervision",
    "abstract": "Learning RAW-to-sRGB mapping has drawn increasing attention in recent years,\nwherein an input raw image is trained to imitate the target sRGB image captured\nby another camera. However, the severe color inconsistency makes it very\nchallenging to generate well-aligned training pairs of input raw and target\nsRGB images. While learning with inaccurately aligned supervision is prone to\ncausing pixel shift and producing blurry results. In this paper, we circumvent\nsuch issue by presenting a joint learning model for image alignment and\nRAW-to-sRGB mapping. To diminish the effect of color inconsistency in image\nalignment, we introduce to use a global color mapping (GCM) module to generate\nan initial sRGB image given the input raw image, which can keep the spatial\nlocation of the pixels unchanged, and the target sRGB image is utilized to\nguide GCM for converting the color towards it. Then a pre-trained optical flow\nestimation network (e.g., PWC-Net) is deployed to warp the target sRGB image to\nalign with the GCM output. To alleviate the effect of inaccurately aligned\nsupervision, the warped target sRGB image is leveraged to learn RAW-to-sRGB\nmapping. When training is done, the GCM module and optical flow network can be\ndetached, thereby bringing no extra computation cost for inference. Experiments\nshow that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-arts on ZRR and\nSR-RAW datasets. With our joint learning model, a light-weight backbone can\nachieve better quantitative and qualitative performance on ZRR dataset.

However,\nDARTS still suffers from frequent performance collapse, which happens when some\noperations, such as skip connections, zeroes and poolings, dominate the\narchitecture. In this paper, we are the first to point out that the phenomenon\nis attributed to bi-level optimization. We propose Single-DARTS which merely\nuses single-level optimization, updating network weights and architecture\nparameters simultaneously with the same data batch.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel shape-optimization technique for the design of\nmixing elements in single-screw extruders. Extruders enable the continuous\nproduction of constant-cross-section profiles. Equipped with one or several\nscrew-shaped rotors, extruders transport polymer particles towards the outlet.\nDue to shear heating, melting is induced and a melt stream is created, which\ncan be further processed. While many variants of multi-screw extruders exist, a\nsignificant share of all extrusion machines is made up of single-screw\nextruders due to their comparatively low operating costs and complexity. While\nthe reduced complexity yields economic benefits, single-screw extruders' mixing\ncapabilities, i.e., their ability to produce a melt with a homogeneous material\nand temperature distribution, suffer compared to multi-screw extruders. To\ncompensate for this shortcoming, so-called mixing elements are added to the\nscrew to enhance mixing by recurring flow reorientations. In view of the\nlargely unintuitive flow characteristics of polymer melts, we present an\noptimization framework that allows designing these mixing elements numerically\nbased on finite-element simulations of the melt flow. To reduce the\ncomputational demand required by shape optimization of a complete mixing\nsection, we only focus on the shape optimization of a single mixing element.\nThis paper presents advances in three aspects of numerical design: (1) A\ncombination of free-form deformation and surface splines is presented, allowing\nto parameterize the mixing element's shape by very few variables. (2) The\ncombination of this concept with a linear-elasticity-based mesh update method\nto deform the computational domain without the need for remeshing is\ndemonstrated. (3) A simple yet robust and sensitive objective formulation to\nassess distributive mixing in laminar flows based on a measure for the\ninterfacial area is proposed.",

The goals of the system can be specified as\nformal properties that are verified against models of the system. On the other\nhand, control theory (CT) provides a well-established foundation for designing\nfeedback loop systems and providing guarantees for essential properties, such\nas stability, settling time, and steady state error. Currently, it is an open\nquestion whether and how traditional SE approaches to self-adaptation consider\nproperties from CT. Answering this question is challenging given the principle\ndifferences in representing properties in both fields. In this paper, we take a\nfirst step to answer this question. We follow a bottom up approach where we\nspecify a control design (in Simulink) for a case inspired by Scuderia Ferrari\n(F1) and provide evidence for stability and safety. The design is then\ntransferred into code (in C) that is further optimized. Next, we define\nproperties that enable verifying whether the control properties still hold at\ncode level. Then, we consolidate the solution by mapping the properties in both\nworlds using specification patterns as common language and we verify the\ncorrectness of this mapping.

In\npursuit of better CD performance, it has become a tendency to design deeper and\nmore complicated FCNs, which inevitably brings about huge numbers of parameters\nand an unbearable computational burden. With the goal of designing a quite deep\narchitecture to obtain more precise CD results while simultaneously decreasing\nparameter numbers to improve efficiency, in this work, we present a very deep\nand efficient CD network, entitled EffCDNet. In EffCDNet, to reduce the\nnumerous parameters associated with deep architecture, an efficient convolution\nconsisting of depth-wise convolution and group convolution with a channel\nshuffle mechanism is introduced to replace standard convolutional layers. In\nterms of the specific network architecture, EffCDNet does not use mainstream\nUNet-like architecture, but rather adopts the architecture with a very deep\nencoder and a lightweight decoder. In the very deep encoder, two very deep\nsiamese streams stacked by efficient convolution first extract two highly\nrepresentative and informative feature maps from input image-pairs.\nSubsequently, an efficient ASPP module is designed to capture multi-scale\nchange information. In the lightweight decoder, a recurrent criss-cross\nself-attention (RCCA) module is applied to efficiently utilize non-local\nsimilar feature representations to enhance discriminability for each pixel,\nthus effectively separating the changed and unchanged regions. Moreover, to\ntackle the optimization problem in confused pixels, two novel loss functions\nbased on information entropy are presented.

In this paper, taking a new perspective, we\npropose a specificity-preserving network (SP-Net) for RGB-D saliency detection,\nwhich benefits saliency detection performance by exploring both the shared\ninformation and modality-specific properties (e.g., specificity). Specifically,\ntwo modality-specific networks and a shared learning network are adopted to\ngenerate individual and shared saliency maps. A cross-enhanced integration\nmodule (CIM) is proposed to fuse cross-modal features in the shared learning\nnetwork, which are then propagated to the next layer for integrating\ncross-level information.

Further, a\nskip connection is used to combine hierarchical features between the encoder\nand decoder layers.

In this work we propose a three-stage framework\nthat allows to explicitly and effectively address these challenges. While the\nfirst phase learns base classes with many samples, the second phase learns a\ncalibrated classifier for novel classes from few samples while also preventing\ncatastrophic forgetting. In the final phase, calibration is achieved across all\nclasses.

To address these issues, we propose DeepExpress - a deep-learning\nbased express delivery sequence prediction model, which extends the classic\nseq2seq framework to learning complex coupling between sequence and features.\nDeepExpress leverages an express delivery seq2seq learning, a\ncarefully-designed heterogeneous feature representation, and a novel joint\ntraining attention mechanism to adaptively map heterogeneous data, and capture\nsequence-feature coupling for precise estimation.

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) communication is considered to be a promising technology for\nfuture 6G network. To overcome the severe attenuation and relieve the high\npower consumption, massive MIMO with hybrid precoding has been widely\nconsidered for THz communication. However, accurate wideband channel estimation\nis challenging in THz massive MIMO systems. The existing wideband channel\nestimation schemes based on the ideal assumption of common sparse channel\nsupport will suffer from a severe performance loss due to the beam split\neffect. In this paper, we propose a beam split pattern detection based channel\nestimation scheme to realize reliable wideband channel estimation.\nSpecifically, a comprehensive analysis on the angle-domain sparse structure of\nthe wideband channel is provided by considering the beam split effect. Based on\nthe analysis, we define a series of index sets called as beam split patterns,\nwhich are proved to have a one-to-one match to different physical channel\ndirections. Inspired by this one-to-one match, we propose to estimate the\nphysical channel direction by exploiting beam split patterns at first. Then,\nthe sparse channel supports at different subcarriers can be obtained by\nutilizing a support detection window. This support detection window is\ngenerated by expanding the beam split pattern which is determined by the\nobtained physical channel direction. The above estimation procedure will be\nrepeated path by path until all path components are estimated. The proposed\nscheme exploits the wideband channel property implied by the beam split effect,\nwhich can significantly improve the channel estimation accuracy. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed scheme is able to achieve higher accuracy than\nexisting schemes.",

After a fair comparison, the experimental results on\nHPatches dataset reveal that the performance gap between classical and\nlearning-based methods is not that significant. Throughout the experiments, we\ndemonstrated that SuperGlue is the state-of-the-art technique for the image\nmatching problem on HPatches dataset. However, if a single parameter, namely\nratio test threshold, is carefully optimized, a well-known traditional method\nSIFT performs quite close to SuperGlue and even outperforms in terms of mean\nmatching accuracy (MMA) under 1 and 2 pixel thresholds. Moreover, a recent\napproach, DFM, which only uses pre-trained VGG features as descriptors and\nratio test, is shown to outperform most of the well-trained learning-based\nmethods.

Main-stream methods predict the missing shapes by\ndecoding a global feature learned from the input point cloud, which often leads\nto deficient results in preserving topology consistency and surface details. In\nthis work, we present ME-PCN, a point completion network that leverages\n`emptiness' in 3D shape space. Given a single depth scan, previous methods\noften encode the occupied partial shapes while ignoring the empty regions (e.g.\nholes) in depth maps. In contrast, we argue that these `emptiness' clues\nindicate shape boundaries that can be used to improve topology representation\nand detail granularity on surfaces. Specifically, our ME-PCN encodes both the\noccupied point cloud and the neighboring `empty points'. It estimates\ncoarse-grained but complete and reasonable surface points in the first stage,\nfollowed by a refinement stage to produce fine-grained surface details.\nComprehensive experiments verify that our ME-PCN presents better qualitative\nand quantitative performance against the state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Test coverage is a standard measure used to evaluate the completeness of a\ntest suite. Coverage is typically computed on source code, by assessing the\nextent of source code entities (e.g., statements, data dependencies, control\ndependencies) that are exercised when running test cases. When considering REST\nAPIs, an alternative perspective to assess test suite completeness is with\nrespect to the service definition. This paper presents Restats, a test coverage\ntool for REST APIs that supports eight state-of-the-art test coverage metrics\nwith a black-box perspective, i.e., only relying on the OpenAPI interface\nspecification of the REST API under test. In fact, metrics are computed by only\nobserving the HTTP requests and responses occurring at testing time, and no\naccess to source/compiled code of the REST API is required. These coverage\nmetrics come in handy for: (i) developers and test engineers working at\ndevelopment and maintenance tasks; (ii) stakeholders and customers who want to\nevaluate the completeness of acceptance tests; (iii) researches interested in\ncomparing different automated test case generation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Based on the powerful feature extraction ability of deep learning\narchitecture, recently, deep-learning based watermarking algorithms have been\nwidely studied. The basic framework of such algorithm is the auto-encoder like\nend-to-end architecture with an encoder, a noise layer and a decoder. The key\nto guarantee robustness is the adversarial training with the differential noise\nlayer. However, we found that none of the existing framework can well ensure\nthe robustness against JPEG compression, which is non-differential but is an\nessential and important image processing operation. To address such\nlimitations, we proposed a novel end-to-end training architecture, which\nutilizes Mini-Batch of Real and Simulated JPEG compression (MBRS) to enhance\nthe JPEG robustness. Precisely, for different mini-batches, we randomly choose\none of real JPEG, simulated JPEG and noise-free layer as the noise layer.\nBesides, we suggest to utilize the Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks which can\nlearn better feature in embedding and extracting stage, and propose a \"message\nprocessor\" to expand the message in a more appreciate way. Meanwhile, to\nimprove the robustness against crop attack, we propose an additive diffusion\nblock into the network. The extensive experimental results have demonstrated\nthe superior performance of the proposed scheme compared with the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms. Under the JPEG compression with quality factor\nQ=50, our models achieve a bit error rate less than 0.01% for extracted\nmessages, with PSNR larger than 36 for the encoded images, which shows the\nwell-enhanced robustness against JPEG attack. Besides, under many other\ndistortions such as Gaussian filter, crop, cropout and dropout, the proposed\nframework also obtains strong robustness. The code implemented by PyTorch\n\\cite{2011torch7} is avaiable in https://github.com/jzyustc/MBRS.",

Nevertheless, there has not been an open-source codebase\nin support of training and deploying numerous neural network models for\ncross-modal analytics in a unified and modular fashion. In this work, we\npropose X-modaler -- a versatile and high-performance codebase that\nencapsulates the state-of-the-art cross-modal analytics into several\ngeneral-purpose stages (e.g., pre-processing, encoder, cross-modal interaction,\ndecoder, and decode strategy).

This way naturally enables a flexible\nimplementation of state-of-the-art algorithms for image captioning, video\ncaptioning, and vision-language pre-training, aiming to facilitate the rapid\ndevelopment of research community. Meanwhile, since the effective modular\ndesigns in several stages (e.g., cross-modal interaction) are shared across\ndifferent vision-language tasks, X-modaler can be simply extended to power\nstartup prototypes for other tasks in cross-modal analytics, including visual\nquestion answering, visual commonsense reasoning, and cross-modal retrieval.\nX-modaler is an Apache-licensed codebase, and its source codes, sample projects\nand pre-trained models are available on-line:\nhttps://github.com/YehLi/xmodaler.",

We derive three equivalent formulations for the proposed model. All\nthe three formulations assume velocity and pressure equilibrium across the\nmaterial interface. These equivalent forms provide different physical\nperspectives and numerical conveniences. Temperature equilibration and\ncontinuity across the material interfaces are achieved with the instantaneous\nthermal relaxation. Temperature equilibrium is maintained during the heat\nconduction process. The proposed models are proved to respect the\nthermodynamical laws. For numerical solution, the model is split into a\nhyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) system and parabolic PDE\nsystems. The former is solved with the high-order Godunov finite volume method\nthat ensures the pressure-velocity-temperature (PVT) equilibrium conduction.\nThe parabolic PDEs are solved with both the implicit and the explicit locally\niterative method (LIM) based on Chebyshev parameters. Numerical results are\npresented for several multicomponent flow problems with diffusion processes.\nFurthermore, we apply the proposed model to simulate the target ablation\nproblem that is of significance to inertial confinement fusion. Comparisons\nwith one-temperature models in literature demonstrate the ability to maintain\nthe PVT property and superior convergence performance of the proposed model in\nsolving multicomponent problems with diffusions.",

    "abstract": "Coming up with effective ad text is a time consuming process, and\nparticularly challenging for small businesses with limited advertising\nexperience. When an inexperienced advertiser onboards with a poorly written ad\ntext, the ad platform has the opportunity to detect low performing ad text, and\nprovide improvement suggestions. To realize this opportunity, we propose an ad\ntext strength indicator (TSI) which: (i) predicts the click-through-rate (CTR)\nfor an input ad text, (ii) fetches similar existing ads to create a\nneighborhood around the input ad, (iii) and compares the predicted CTRs in the\nneighborhood to declare whether the input ad is strong or weak. In addition, as\nsuggestions for ad text improvement, TSI shows anonymized versions of superior\nads (higher predicted CTR) in the neighborhood. For (i), we propose a BERT\nbased text-to-CTR model trained on impressions and clicks associated with an ad\ntext. For (ii), we propose a sentence-BERT based semantic-ad-similarity model\ntrained using weak labels from ad campaign setup data. Offline experiments\ndemonstrate that our BERT based text-to-CTR model achieves a significant lift\nin CTR prediction AUC for cold start (new) advertisers compared to bag-of-words\nbased baselines. In addition, our semantic-textual-similarity model for similar\nads retrieval achieves a precision@1 of 0.93 (for retrieving ads from the same\nproduct category); this is significantly higher compared to unsupervised\nTF-IDF, word2vec, and sentence-BERT baselines.

By replacing the normal convolution\noperations with the atrous convolution in the backbone, prior knowledge is\nprovided to keep the edge details and the global reception field can be\nextended. We explored the results in 3 ways: 1) The efficiency of the\nDDC-ResNet. 6 typical methods of automatic feature extraction coupling with 9\nmainstream classifiers are evaluated in our dataset with fair implementation\ndetails. Experimental results demonstrate that the combination of our approach\noutperforms other combinations in terms of average accuracy and separate-gender\naccuracy. It reaches 96.5% for average and 0.9752 (males)/0.9548 (females) for\nseparate-gender accuracy. 2) The effect of fingers. It is found that the best\nperformance of classifying gender with separate fingers is achieved by the\nright ring finger. 3) The effect of specific features.

Here, we show how\nunderstanding the general distribution of the drone data via a Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN) and explaining the missing features using Topological\nData Analysis (TDA) - can allow us to acquire missing data to achieve rapid and\nmore accurate learning. We demonstrate our results on a drone image dataset,\nwhich contains both real drone images as well as simulated images from\ncomputer-aided design. When compared to random data collection (usual practice\n- discriminator accuracy of 94.67\\% after 200 epochs), our proposed GAN-TDA\ninformed data collection method offers a significant 4\\% improvement (99.42\\%\nafter 200 epochs). We believe that this approach of exploiting general data\ndistribution knowledge form neural networks can be applied to a wide range of\nscarce data open challenges.",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a new class of proactive attacks called the Informational\nDenial-of-Service (IDoS) attacks that exploit the attentional human\nvulnerability. By generating a large volume of feints, IDoS attacks deplete the\ncognition resources of human operators to prevent humans from identifying the\nreal attacks hidden among feints. This work aims to formally define IDoS\nattacks, quantify their consequences, and develop human-assistive security\ntechnologies to mitigate the severity level and risks of IDoS attacks. To this\nend, we model the feint and real attacks' sequential arrivals with category\nlabels as a semi-Markov process. The assistive technology strategically manages\nhuman attention by highlighting selective alerts periodically to prevent the\ndistraction of other alerts. A data-driven approach is applied to evaluate\nhuman performance under different Attention Management (AM) strategies. Under a\nrepresentative special case, we establish the computational equivalency between\ntwo dynamic programming representations to simplify the theoretical computation\nand the online learning. A case study corroborates the effectiveness of the\nlearning framework. The numerical results illustrate how AM strategies can\nalleviate the severity level and the risk of IDoS attacks. Furthermore, we\ncharacterize the fundamental limits of the minimum severity level under all AM\nstrategies and the maximum length of the inspection period to reduce the IDoS\nrisks.",

To detect and localize accurate 3D bounding boxes, LiDAR-based\nmodels can encode accurate object boundaries and surface normal directions from\nLiDAR point clouds. However, the detection results of stereo-based detectors\nare easily affected by the erroneous depth features due to the limitation of\nstereo matching. To solve the problem, we propose LIGA-Stereo (LiDAR Geometry\nAware Stereo Detector) to learn stereo-based 3D detectors under the guidance of\nhigh-level geometry-aware representations of LiDAR-based detection models. In\naddition, we found existing voxel-based stereo detectors failed to learn\nsemantic features effectively from indirect 3D supervisions. We attach an\nauxiliary 2D detection head to provide direct 2D semantic supervisions.\nExperiment results show that the above two strategies improved the geometric\nand semantic representation capabilities.

    "abstract": "Environmental understanding capability of $\\textit{augmented}$ (AR) and\n$\\textit{mixed reality}$ (MR) devices are continuously improving through\nadvances in sensing, computer vision, and machine learning. Various AR/MR\napplications demonstrate such capabilities i.e. scanning a space using a\nhandheld or head mounted device and capturing a digital representation of the\nspace that are accurate copies of the real space. However, these capabilities\nimpose privacy risks to users: personally identifiable information can leak\nfrom captured 3D maps of the sensitive spaces and/or captured sensitive objects\nwithin the mapped space. Thus, in this work, we demonstrate how we can leverage\n3D object regeneration for preserving privacy of 3D point clouds. That is, we\nemploy an intermediary layer of protection to transform the 3D point cloud\nbefore providing it to the third-party applications. Specifically, we use an\nexisting adversarial autoencoder to generate copies of 3D objects where the\nlikeness of the copies from the original can be varied. To test the viability\nand performance of this method as a privacy preserving mechanism, we use a 3D\nclassifier to classify and identify these transformed point clouds i.e. perform\n$\\textit{super}$-class and $\\textit{intra}$-class classification. To measure\nthe performance of the proposed privacy framework, we define privacy,\n$\\Pi\\in[0,1]$, and utility metrics, $Q\\in[0,1]$, which are desired to be\nmaximized. Experimental evaluation shows that the privacy framework can indeed\nvariably effect the privacy of a 3D object by varying the privilege level\n$l\\in[0,1]$ i.e. if a low $l<0.17$ is maintained, $\\Pi_1,\\Pi_2>0.4$ is ensured\nwhere $\\Pi_1,\\Pi_2$ are super- and intra-class privacy.

    "abstract": "Background: Histopathology is an important modality for the diagnosis and\nmanagement of many diseases in modern healthcare, and plays a critical role in\ncancer care. Pathology samples can be large and require multi-site sampling,\nleading to upwards of 20 slides for a single tumor, and the human-expert tasks\nof site selection and and quantitative assessment of mitotic figures are time\nconsuming and subjective. Automating these tasks in the setting of a digital\npathology service presents significant opportunities to improve workflow\nefficiency and augment human experts in practice. Approach: Multiple\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques for histopathology image\nclassification and mitotic figure detection were used in the development of\nOncoPetNet. Additionally, model-free approaches were used to increase speed and\naccuracy. The robust and scalable inference engine leverages Pytorch's\nperformance optimizations as well as specifically developed speed up techniques\nin inference. Results: The proposed system, demonstrated significantly improved\nmitotic counting performance for 41 cancer cases across 14 cancer types\ncompared to human expert baselines. In 21.9% of cases use of OncoPetNet led to\nchange in tumor grading compared to human expert evaluation. In deployment, an\neffective 0.27 min/slide inference was achieved in a high throughput veterinary\ndiagnostic pathology service across 2 centers processing 3,323 digital whole\nslide images daily. Conclusion: This work represents the first successful\nautomated deployment of deep learning systems for real-time expert-level\nperformance on important histopathology tasks at scale in a high volume\nclinical practice. The resulting impact outlines important considerations for\nmodel development, deployment, clinical decision making, and informs best\npractices for implementation of deep learning systems in digital histopathology\npractices.",

In this\npaper, we propose a practical solution named degraded-reference IQA (DR-IQA),\nwhich exploits the inputs of IR models, degraded images, as references.\nSpecifically, we extract reference information from degraded images by\ndistilling knowledge from pristine-quality images. The distillation is achieved\nthrough learning a reference space, where various degraded images are\nencouraged to share the same feature statistics with pristine-quality images.\nAnd the reference space is optimized to capture deep image priors that are\nuseful for quality assessment.

Here, we report the\ndesign of diffractive optical networks for the classification and\nreconstruction of spatially overlapping, phase-encoded objects. When two\ndifferent phase-only objects spatially overlap, the individual object functions\nare perturbed since their phase patterns are summed up. The retrieval of the\nunderlying phase images from solely the overlapping phase distribution presents\na challenging problem, the solution of which is generally not unique. We show\nthat through a task-specific training process, passive diffractive networks\ncomposed of successive transmissive layers can all-optically and simultaneously\nclassify two different randomly-selected, spatially overlapping phase images at\nthe input. After trained with ~550 million unique combinations of phase-encoded\nhandwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, our blind testing results reveal\nthat the diffractive network achieves an accuracy of >85.8% for all-optical\nclassification of two overlapping phase images of new handwritten digits. In\naddition to all-optical classification of overlapping phase objects, we also\ndemonstrate the reconstruction of these phase images based on a shallow\nelectronic neural network that uses the highly compressed output of the\ndiffractive network as its input (with e.g., ~20-65 times less number of\npixels) to rapidly reconstruct both of the phase images, despite their spatial\noverlap and related phase ambiguity.

Our proof techniques for\nobtaining these equivalence forms rely on novel procedures of moving mass in\ngraph theory to push transportation plan into appropriate regions. Finally,\nbased on the equivalence forms, we develop optimization algorithm, named\nApproxMPOT algorithm, that builds upon the Sinkhorn algorithm for solving the\nentropic regularized multimarginal optimal transport. We demonstrate that the\nApproxMPOT algorithm can approximate the optimal value of multimarginal POT\nproblem with a computational complexity upper bound of the order\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(m^3(n+1)^{m}/ \\varepsilon^2)$ where $\\varepsilon > 0$\nstands for the desired tolerance.",

This is a combinatorial optimisation problem in which we\nsearch for the optimal stratification from the set of all possible\nstratifications of basic strata. Each stratification being a solution the\nquality of which is measured by its cost. This problem is intractable for\nlarger sets. Furthermore evaluating the cost of each solution is expensive. A\nnumber of heuristic algorithms have already been developed to solve this\nproblem with the aim of finding acceptable solutions in reasonable computation\ntimes. However, the heuristics for these algorithms need to be trained in order\nto optimise performance in each instance. We compare the above multi-stage\ncombination of algorithms with three recent algorithms and report the solution\ncosts, evaluation times and training times. The multi-stage combinations\ngenerally compare well with the recent algorithms both in the case of atomic\nand continuous strata and provide the survey designer with a greater choice of\nalgorithms to choose from.",

    "abstract": "We are interested in learning generative models for complex geometries\ndescribed via manifolds, such as spheres, tori, and other implicit surfaces.\nCurrent extensions of existing (Euclidean) generative models are restricted to\nspecific geometries and typically suffer from high computational costs. We\nintroduce Moser Flow (MF), a new class of generative models within the family\nof continuous normalizing flows (CNF). MF also produces a CNF via a solution to\nthe change-of-variable formula, however differently from other CNF methods, its\nmodel (learned) density is parameterized as the source (prior) density minus\nthe divergence of a neural network (NN). The divergence is a local, linear\ndifferential operator, easy to approximate and calculate on manifolds.\nTherefore, unlike other CNFs, MF does not require invoking or backpropagating\nthrough an ODE solver during training. Furthermore, representing the model\ndensity explicitly as the divergence of a NN rather than as a solution of an\nODE facilitates learning high fidelity densities. Theoretically, we prove that\nMF constitutes a universal density approximator under suitable assumptions.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate for the first time the use of flow models for\nsampling from general curved surfaces and achieve significant improvements in\ndensity estimation, sample quality, and training complexity over existing CNFs\non challenging synthetic geometries and real-world benchmarks from the earth\nand climate sciences.",

Unlike any other virus, the number of\ncurrently available sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in public databases such as GISAID\nis already several million. This amount of data has the potential to uncover\nthe evolutionary dynamics of a virus like never before. However, a million is\nalready several orders of magnitude beyond what can be processed by the\ntraditional methods designed to reconstruct a virus's evolutionary history,\nsuch as those that build a phylogenetic tree. Hence, new and scalable methods\nwill need to be devised in order to make use of the ever increasing number of\nviral sequences being collected.\nSince identifying variants is an important part of understanding the\nevolution of a virus, in this paper, we propose an approach based on clustering\nsequences to identify the current major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using a $k$-mer\nbased feature vector generation and efficient feature selection methods, our\napproach is effective in identifying variants, as well as being efficient and\nscalable to millions of sequences. Such a clustering method allows us to show\nthe relative proportion of each variant over time, giving the rate of spread of\neach variant in different locations -- something which is important for vaccine\ndevelopment and distribution. We also compute the importance of each amino acid\nposition of the spike protein in identifying a given variant in terms of\ninformation gain.

    "abstract": "X-ray examination is suitable for screening of gastric cancer. Compared to\nendoscopy, which can only be performed by doctors, X-ray imaging can also be\nperformed by radiographers, and thus, can treat more patients. However, the\ndiagnostic accuracy of gastric radiographs is as low as 85%. To address this\nproblem, highly accurate and quantitative automated diagnosis using machine\nlearning needs to be performed. This paper proposes a diagnostic support method\nfor detecting gastric cancer sites from X-ray images with high accuracy. The\ntwo new technical proposal of the method are (1) stochastic functional gastric\nimage augmentation (sfGAIA), and (2) hard boundary box training (HBBT). The\nformer is a probabilistic enhancement of gastric folds in X-ray images based on\nmedical knowledge, whereas the latter is a recursive retraining technique to\nreduce false positives. We use 4,724 gastric radiographs of 145 patients in\nclinical practice and evaluate the cancer detection performance of the method\nin a patient-based five-group cross-validation. The proposed sfGAIA and HBBT\nsignificantly enhance the performance of the EfficientDet-D7 network by 5.9% in\nterms of the F1-score, and our screening method reaches a practical screening\ncapability for gastric cancer (F1: 57.8%, recall: 90.2%, precision: 42.5%).",

The online prediction algorithms as usual consist of the selection of\nkernel structure parameters and the kernel weight vector updating. For\nstructure parameters, the kernel dictionary is selected by some sparsification\ntechniques with online selective modeling criteria, and moreover the kernel\ncovariance matrix is intermittently optimized in the light of the covariance\nmatrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). Optimizing the real symmetric\ncovariance matrix can not only improve the kernel structure's flexibility by\nthe cross relatedness of the input variables, but also partly alleviate the\nprediction uncertainty caused by the kernel dictionary selection for\nnonstationary time series. In order to sufficiently capture the underlying\ndynamic characteristics in prediction-error time series, a generalized\noptimization strategy is designed to construct the kernel dictionary\nsequentially in multiple kernel connection modes. The generalized optimization\nstrategy provides a more self-contained way to construct the entire kernel\nconnections, which enhances the ability to adaptively track the changing\ndynamic characteristics.

However, the quality of video delivery system greatly\ndepends on the Internet bandwidth. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are utilized to\nimprove the quality of video delivery recently. These methods divide a video\ninto chunks, and stream LR video chunks and corresponding content-aware models\nto the client. The client runs the inference of models to super-resolve the LR\nchunks. Consequently, a large number of models are streamed in order to deliver\na video. In this paper, we first carefully study the relation between models of\ndifferent chunks, then we tactfully design a joint training framework along\nwith the Content-aware Feature Modulation (CaFM) layer to compress these models\nfor neural video delivery. {\\bf With our method, each video chunk only requires\nless than $1\\% $ of original parameters to be streamed, achieving even better\nSR performance.} We conduct extensive experiments across various SR backbones,\nvideo time length, and scaling factors to demonstrate the advantages of our\nmethod. Besides, our method can be also viewed as a new approach of video\ncoding.
