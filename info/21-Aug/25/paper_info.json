    "abstract": "One of the main goals of coding theory is to construct codes with best\npossible parameters and properties. A special class of codes called\nquasi-twisted (QT) codes is well-known to produce codes with good parameters.\nMost of the work on QT codes has been over the 1-generator case. In this work,\nwe focus on 2-generator QT codes and generalize the ASR algorithm that has been\nvery effective to produce new linear codes from 1-generator QT codes. Moreover,\nwe also generalize a recent algorithm to test equivalence of cyclic codes to\nconstacyclic codes. This algorithm makes the ASR search even more effective. As\na result of implementing our algorithm, we have found 103 QT codes that are new\namong the class of QT codes. Additionally, most of these codes possess the\nfollowing additional properties: a) they have the same parameters as best known\nlinear codes, and b) many of the have additional desired properties such as\nbeing LCD and dual-containing. Further, we have also found a binary 2-generator\nQT code that is new (record breaking) among all binary linear codes and its\nextension yields another record breaking binary linear code.",

    "abstract": "Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) facilitate vehicles to broadcast beacon\nmessages to ensure road safety. Rogue nodes in VANETs cause a Sybil attack to\ncreate an illusion of fake traffic congestion by broadcasting malicious\ninformation leading to catastrophic consequences, such as the collision of\nvehicles. Previous researchers used either cryptography, trust scores, or past\nvehicle data to detect rogue nodes, but they suffer from high processing delay,\noverhead, and false-positive rate (FPR). We propose a fog computing-based Sybil\nattack detection for VANETs (FSDV), which utilizes onboard units (OBUs) of all\nthe vehicles in the region to create a dynamic fog for rogue nodes detection.\nWe aim to reduce the data processing delays, overhead, and FPR in detecting\nrogue nodes causing Sybil attacks at high vehicle densities. The performance of\nour framework was carried out with simulations using OMNET++ and SUMO\nsimulators. Results show that our framework ensures 43% lower processing\ndelays, 13% lower overhead, and 35% lower FPR at high vehicle densities\ncompared to existing Sybil attack detection schemes.",

    "abstract": "Classic image scaling (e.g. bicubic) can be seen as one convolutional layer\nand a single upscaling filter. Its implementation is ubiquitous in all display\ndevices and image processing software. In the last decade deep learning systems\nhave been introduced for the task of image super-resolution (SR), using several\nconvolutional layers and numerous filters. These methods have taken over the\nbenchmarks of image quality for upscaling tasks. Would it be possible to\nreplace classic upscalers with deep learning architectures on edge devices such\nas display panels, tablets, laptop computers, etc.? On one hand, the current\ntrend in Edge-AI chips shows a promising future in this direction, with rapid\ndevelopment of hardware that can run deep-learning tasks efficiently. On the\nother hand, in image SR only few architectures have pushed the limit to extreme\nsmall sizes that can actually run on edge devices at real-time. We explore\npossible solutions to this problem with the aim to fill the gap between classic\nupscalers and small deep learning configurations. As a transition from classic\nto deep-learning upscaling we propose edge-SR (eSR), a set of one-layer\narchitectures that use interpretable mechanisms to upscale images. Certainly, a\none-layer architecture cannot reach the quality of deep learning systems.\nNevertheless, we find that for high speed requirements, eSR becomes better at\ntrading-off image quality and runtime performance. Filling the gap between\nclassic and deep-learning architectures for image upscaling is critical for\nmassive adoption of this technology. It is equally important to have an\ninterpretable system that can reveal the inner strategies to solve this problem\nand guide us to future improvements and better understanding of larger\nnetworks.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in dense retrieval techniques have offered the promise of\nbeing able not just to re-rank documents using contextualised language models\nsuch as BERT, but also to use such models to identify documents from the\ncollection in the first place. However, when using dense retrieval approaches\nthat use multiple embedded representations for each query, a large number of\ndocuments can be retrieved for each query, hindering the efficiency of the\nmethod. Hence, this work is the first to consider efficiency improvements in\nthe context of a dense retrieval approach (namely ColBERT), by pruning query\nterm embeddings that are estimated not to be useful for retrieving relevant\ndocuments. Our proposed query embeddings pruning reduces the cost of the dense\nretrieval operation, as well as reducing the number of documents that are\nretrieved and hence require to be fully scored. Experiments conducted on the\nMSMARCO passage ranking corpus demonstrate that, when reducing the number of\nquery embeddings used from 32 to 3 based on the collection frequency of the\ncorresponding tokens, query embedding pruning results in no statistically\nsignificant differences in effectiveness, while reducing the number of\ndocuments retrieved by 70%. In terms of mean response time for the end-to-end\nto end system, this results in a 2.65x speedup.",

These interpretations are usually given\nin the form of heatmaps, each one illustrating relevant patterns regarding the\nprediction for a given instance. Bayesian approaches such as Bayesian Neural\nNetworks (BNNs) so far have a limited form of transparency (model transparency)\nalready built-in through their prior weight distribution, but notably, they\nlack explanations of their predictions for given instances. In this work, we\nbring together these two perspectives of transparency into a holistic\nexplanation framework for explaining BNNs. Within the Bayesian framework, the\nnetwork weights follow a probability distribution. Hence, the standard\n(deterministic) prediction strategy of DNNs extends in BNNs to a predictive\ndistribution, and thus the standard explanation extends to an explanation\ndistribution. Exploiting this view, we uncover that BNNs implicitly employ\nmultiple heterogeneous prediction strategies. While some of these are inherited\nfrom standard DNNs, others are revealed to us by considering the inherent\nuncertainty in BNNs. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments on\ntoy/benchmark data and real-world data from pathology show that the proposed\napproach of explaining BNNs can lead to more effective and insightful\nexplanations.",

Using a\nprobabilistic formulation, Hierarchical Network Dissection pairs units of the\nmodel with concepts in our \"Face Dictionary\" (a collection of facial concepts\nwith corresponding sample images). Our pipeline is inspired by Network\nDissection, a popular interpretability model for object-centric and\nscene-centric models. However, our formulation allows to deal with two\nimportant challenges of face-centric models that Network Dissection cannot\naddress: (1) spacial overlap of concepts: there are different facial concepts\nthat simultaneously occur in the same region of the image, like \"nose\" (facial\npart) and \"pointy nose\" (facial attribute); and (2) global concepts: there are\nunits with affinity to concepts that do not refer to specific locations of the\nface (e.g. apparent age). To validate the effectiveness of our unit-concept\npairing formulation, we first conduct controlled experiments on biased data.\nThese experiments illustrate how Hierarchical Network Dissection can be used to\ndiscover bias in the training data. Then, we dissect different face-centric\ninference models trained on widely-used facial datasets.

In this formulation, the inputs are case\nproblems composed of both the inputs and outputs of the data-centric agent and\ncase solutions, the outputs, are explanation categories obtained from domain\nknowledge and subject matter experts.

Recent\nstudies have focused on decentralized control methods to solve this problem due\nto the high computational time in performing load flows in centralized control\ntechniques. To address this issue a novel sensitivity matrix is developed to\nestimate voltages of the network by replacing load flow simulations. In this\npaper, a Centralized Active, Reactive Power Management System (CARPMS) is\nproposed to optimally utilize the reactive power capability of smart\nphoto-voltaic inverters with minimal active power curtailment to mitigate the\nvoltage violation problem. The developed sensitivity matrix is able to reduce\nthe time consumed by 48% compared to load flow simulations, enabling near\nreal-time control optimization. Given the large solution space of power\nsystems, a novel two-stage optimization is proposed, where the solution space\nis narrowed down by a Feasible Region Search (FRS) step, followed by Particle\nSwarm Optimization (PSO). The performance of the proposed methodology is\nanalyzed in comparison to the load flow method to demonstrate the accuracy and\nthe capability of the optimization algorithm to mitigate voltage violations in\nnear real-time. The deviation of mean voltages of the proposed methodology from\nload flow method was; 6.5*10^-3 p.u for reactive power control using\nQ-injection, 1.02*10^-2 p.u for reactive power control using Q-absorption, and\n0 p.u for active power curtailment case.",

    "abstract": "A common setting of reinforcement learning (RL) is a Markov decision process\n(MDP) in which the environment is a stochastic discrete-time dynamical system.\nWhereas MDPs are suitable in such applications as video-games or puzzles,\nphysical systems are time-continuous. Continuous methods of RL are known, but\nthey have their limitations, such as, e.g., collapse of Q-learning. A general\nvariant of RL is of digital format, where updates of the value and policy are\nperformed at discrete moments in time. The agent-environment loop then amounts\nto a sampled system, whereby sample-and-hold is a specific case. In this paper,\nwe propose and benchmark two RL methods suitable for sampled systems.\nSpecifically, we hybridize model-predictive control (MPC) with critics learning\nthe Q- and value function. Optimality is analyzed and performance comparison is\ndone in an experimental case study with a mobile robot.",

    "abstract": "The increasingly diversified Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements envisioned\nfor future wireless networks call for more flexible and inclusive multiple\naccess techniques for supporting emerging applications and communication\nscenarios. To achieve this, we propose a multi-dimensional multiple access\n(MDMA) protocol to meet individual User Equipment's (UE's) unique QoS demands\nwhile utilizing multi-dimensional radio resources cost-effectively. In detail,\nthe proposed scheme consists of two new aspects, i.e., selection of a tailored\nmultiple access mode for each UE while considering the UE-specific radio\nresource utilization cost; and multi-dimensional radio resource allocation\namong coexisting UEs under dynamic network conditions. To reduce the\nUE-specific resource utilization cost, the base station (BS) organizes UEs with\ndisparate multi-domain resource constraints as UE coalition by considering each\nUE's specific resource availability, perceived quality, and utilization\ncapability. Each UE within a coalition could utilize its preferred radio\nresources, which leads to low utilization cost while avoiding resource-sharing\nconflicts with remaining UEs. Furthermore, to meet UE-specific QoS requirements\nand varying resource conditions at the UE side, the multi-dimensional radio\nresource allocation among coexisting UEs is formulated as an optimization\nproblem to maximize the summation of cost-aware utility functions of all UEs. A\nsolution to solve this NP-hard problem with low complexity is developed using\nthe successive convex approximation and the Lagrange dual decomposition\nmethods. The effectiveness of our proposed scheme is validated by numerical\nsimulation and performance comparison with state-of-the-art schemes. In\nparticular, the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme\noutperforms these benchmark schemes by large margins.",

A Siamese network, which relies on data augmentation, is\nthe popular architecture used in these methods. However, these methods rely on\nheuristically crafted data augmentation techniques.

In this study, we propose,\nGraphSurgeon, a novel SSL method for GNNs with the following features. First,\ninstead of heuristics we propose a learnable data augmentation method that is\njointly learned with the embeddings by leveraging the inherent signal encoded\nin the graph. In addition, we take advantage of the flexibility of the\nlearnable data augmentation and introduce a new strategy that augments in the\nembedding space, called post augmentation. This strategy has a significantly\nlower memory overhead and run-time cost. Second, as it is difficult to sample\ntruly contrastive terms, we avoid explicit negative sampling. Third, instead of\nrelying on engineering tricks, we use a scalable constrained optimization\nobjective motivated by Laplacian Eigenmaps to avoid trivial solutions. To\nvalidate the practical use of GraphSurgeon, we perform empirical evaluation\nusing 14 public datasets across a number of domains and ranging from small to\nlarge scale graphs with hundreds of millions of edges.

    "abstract": "In this article we formulate and implement a computational multiphase\nperiporomechanics model for unguided fracturing in unsaturated porous media.\nThe same governing equation for the solid phase applies on and off cracks.\nCrack formation in this framework is autonomous, requiring no prior estimates\nof crack topology. As a new contribution, an energy-based criterion for\narbitrary crack formation is formulated using the peridynamic effective force\nstate for unsaturated porous media. Unsaturated fluid flow in the fracture\nspace is modeled in a simplified way in line with the nonlocal formulation of\nunsaturated fluid flow in bulk. The formulated unsaturated fracturing\nperiporomechanics is numerically implemented through a fractional step\nalgorithm in time and a two-phase mixed meshless method in space. The two-stage\noperator split converts the coupled periporomechanics problem into an undrained\ndeformation and fracture problem and an unsaturated fluid flow in the deformed\nskeleton configuration. Numerical simulations of in-plane open and shear\ncracking are conducted to validate the accuracy and robustness of the\nfracturing unsaturated periporomechanics model. Then numerical examples of\ncrack branching and non-planar cracking in unsaturated soil specimens are\npresented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed multiphase\nperiporomechanics model for unguided cracking in unsaturated porous media.",

    "title": "Rewrite Rule Inference Using Equality Saturation",
    "abstract": "Many compilers, synthesizers, and theorem provers rely on rewrite rules to\nsimplify expressions or prove equivalences. Developing rewrite rules can be\ndifficult: rules may be subtly incorrect, profitable rules are easy to miss,\nand rulesets must be rechecked or extended whenever semantics are tweaked.\nLarge rulesets can also be challenging to apply: redundant rules slow down\nrule-based search and frustrate debugging. This paper explores how equality\nsaturation, a promising technique that uses e-graphs to apply rewrite rules,\ncan also be used to infer rewrite rules. E-graphs can compactly represent the\nexponentially large sets of enumerated terms and potential rewrite rules. We\nshow that equality saturation efficiently shrinks both sets, leading to faster\nsynthesis of smaller, more general rulesets.\nWe prototyped these strategies in a tool dubbed ruler. Compared to a similar\ntool built on CVC4, ruler synthesizes 5.8X smaller rulesets 25X faster without\ncompromising on proving power. In an end-to-end case study, we show\nruler-synthesized rules which perform as well as those crafted by domain\nexperts, and addressed a longstanding issue in a popular open source tool.",

    "abstract": "Existing commercial search engines often struggle to represent different\nperspectives of a search query. Argument retrieval systems address this\nlimitation of search engines and provide both positive (PRO) and negative (CON)\nperspectives about a user's information need on a controversial topic (e.g.,\nclimate change). The effectiveness of such argument retrieval systems is\ntypically evaluated based on topical relevance and argument quality, without\ntaking into account the often differing number of documents shown for the\nargument stances (PRO or CON). Therefore, systems may retrieve relevant\npassages, but with a biased exposure of arguments. In this work, we analyze a\nrange of non-stochastic fairness-aware ranking and diversity metrics to\nevaluate the extent to which argument stances are fairly exposed in argument\nretrieval systems.\nUsing the official runs of the argument retrieval task Touch\\'e at CLEF 2020,\nas well as synthetic data to control the amount and order of argument stances\nin the rankings, we show that systems with the best effectiveness in terms of\ntopical relevance are not necessarily the most fair or the most diverse in\nterms of argument stance.

    "abstract": "Speech-to-text alignment is a critical component of neural textto-speech\n(TTS) models. Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to\nlearn these alignments on-line. However, these alignments tend to be brittle\nand often fail to generalize to long utterances and out-of-domain text, leading\nto missing or repeating words. Most non-autoregressive endto-end TTS models\nrely on durations extracted from external sources. In this paper we leverage\nthe alignment mechanism proposed in RAD-TTS as a generic alignment learning\nframework, easily applicable to a variety of neural TTS models. The framework\ncombines forward-sum algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, and a simple and\nefficient static prior. In our experiments, the alignment learning framework\nimproves all tested TTS architectures, both autoregressive (Flowtron, Tacotron\n2) and non-autoregressive (FastPitch, FastSpeech 2, RAD-TTS). Specifically, it\nimproves alignment convergence speed of existing attention-based mechanisms,\nsimplifies the training pipeline, and makes the models more robust to errors on\nlong utterances. Most importantly, the framework improves the perceived speech\nsynthesis quality, as judged by human evaluators.",

It is difficult,\nhowever, for robot operators to know how well they are being heard in remote\nand noisy classroom environments. One solution is to estimate the operator's\nspeech intelligibility to their listeners in order to provide feedback about it\nto the operator. This work contributes the first evaluation of a speech\nintelligibility feedback system for homebound K-12 students attending class\nremotely. In our four long-term, in-the-wild deployments we found that students\nspeak at different volumes instead of adjusting the robot's volume, and that\ndetailed audio calibration and network latency feedback are needed. We also\ncontribute the first findings about the types and frequencies of multimodal\ncomprehension cues given to homebound students by listeners in the classroom.\nBy annotating and categorizing over 700 cues, we found that the most common cue\nmodalities were conversation turn timing and verbal content. Conversation turn\ntiming cues occurred more frequently overall, whereas verbal content cues\ncontained more information and might be the most frequent modality for negative\ncues.

    "abstract": "The ability to accurately estimate job runtime properties allows a scheduler\nto effectively schedule jobs. State-of-the-art online cluster job schedulers\nuse history-based learning, which uses past job execution information to\nestimate the runtime properties of newly arrived jobs. However, with fast-paced\ndevelopment in cluster technology (in both hardware and software) and changing\nuser inputs, job runtime properties can change over time, which lead to\ninaccurate predictions. In this paper, we explore the potential and limitation\nof real-time learning of job runtime properties, by proactively sampling and\nscheduling a small fraction of the tasks of each job. Such a\ntask-sampling-based approach exploits the similarity among runtime properties\nof the tasks of the same job and is inherently immune to changing job behavior.\nOur study focuses on two key questions in comparing task-sampling-based\nlearning (learning in space) and history-based learning (learning in time): (1)\nCan learning in space be more accurate than learning in time? (2) If so, can\ndelaying scheduling the remaining tasks of a job till the completion of sampled\ntasks be more than compensated by the improved accuracy and result in improved\njob performance? Our analytical and experimental analysis of 3 production\ntraces with different skew and job distribution shows that learning in space\ncan be substantially more accurate. Our simulation and testbed evaluation on\nAzure of the two learning approaches anchored in a generic job scheduler using\n3 production cluster job traces shows that despite its online overhead,\nlearning in space reduces the average Job Completion Time (JCT) by 1.28x,\n1.56x, and 1.32x compared to the prior-art history-based predictor.",

    "abstract": "Higher-order processes with parameterization are capable of abstraction and\napplication (migrated from the lambda-calculus), and thus are computationally\nmore expressive. For the minimal higher-order concurrency, it is well-known\nthat the strong bisimilarity (i.e., the strong bisimulation equality) is\ndecidable in absence of parameterization. By contrast, whether the strong\nbisimilarity is still decidable for parameterized higher-order processes\nremains unclear. In this paper, we focus on this issue. There are basically two\nkinds of parameterization: one on names and the other on processes. We show\nthat the strong bisimilarity is indeed decidable for higher-order processes\nequipped with both kinds of parameterization. Then we demonstrate how to adapt\nthe decision approach to build an axiom system for the strong bisimilarity. On\ntop of these results, we provide an algorithm for the bisimilarity checking.",

Firstly, the semantic\ninformation contained in the features of different layers can be used to detect\ndifferent scale objects, and the feature fusion method is improved to obtain\nmore information beneficial to small objects; secondly, batch normalization\nlayer is introduced to accelerate the training of neural network and make the\nmodel sparse; finally, the model is pruned by scaling factor to get the\ncorresponding compressed model. The experimental results show that the average\naccuracy (mAP) of the algorithm can reach 80.4% on PASCAL VOC and the speed is\n59.5 FPS on GTX1080ti. After pruning, the compressed model can reach 79.9% mAP,\nand 79.5 FPS in detection speed.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach of utilizing the reconfigurable\nintelligent surface (RIS) for joint data modulation and signal beamforming in a\nmulti-user downlink cellular network by leveraging the idea of backscatter\ncommunication. We present a general framework in which the RIS, referred to as\nmodulating intelligent surface (MIS) in this paper, is used to: i) beamform the\nsignals for a set of users whose data modulation is already performed by the\nbase station (BS), and at the same time, ii) embed the data of a different set\nof users by passively modulating the deliberately sent carrier signals from the\nBS to the RIS. To maximize each user's spectral efficiency, a joint non-convex\noptimization problem is formulated under the sum minimum mean-square error\n(MMSE) criterion. Alternating optimization is used to divide the original joint\nproblem into two tasks of: i) separately optimizing the MIS phase-shifts for\npassive beamforming along with data embedding for the BS- and MIS-served users,\nrespectively, and ii) jointly optimizing the active precoder and the receive\nscaling factor for the BS- and MIS-served users, respectively. While the\nsolution to the latter joint problem is found in closed-form using traditional\noptimization techniques, the optimal phase-shifts at the MIS are obtained by\nderiving the appropriate optimization-oriented vector approximate message\npassing (OOVAMP) algorithm. Moreover, the original joint problem is solved\nunder both ideal and practical constraints on the MIS phase shifts, namely, the\nunimodular constraint and assuming each MIS element to be terminated by a\nvariable reactive load. The proposed MIS-assisted scheme is compared against\nstate-of-the-art RIS-assisted wireless communication schemes and simulation\nresults reveal that it brings substantial improvements in terms of system\nthroughput while supporting a much higher number of users.",

Current studies on this issue have made significant\ncontributions to developing multimodal models, but they are defective in\nmodeling the multimodal content sufficiently.

In this paper, we find three valuable\ntext-image correlations in multimodal fake news: entity inconsistency, mutual\nenhancement, and text complementation. To effectively capture these multimodal\nclues, we innovatively extract visual entities (such as celebrities and\nlandmarks) to understand the news-related high-level semantics of images, and\nthen model the multimodal entity inconsistency and mutual enhancement with the\nhelp of visual entities. Moreover, we extract the embedded text in images as\nthe complementation of the original text.

Unlike labeling for image\nclassification, this problem is not well defined due to the object's bounding\nbox. In this paper, we investigate the problem from a perspective of\ndistillation, hence we call Label Assignment Distillation (LAD). Our initial\nmotivation is very simple, we use a teacher network to generate labels for the\nstudent. This can be achieved in two ways: either using the teacher's\nprediction as the direct targets (soft label), or through the hard labels\ndynamically assigned by the teacher (LAD). Our experiments reveal that: (i) LAD\nis more effective than soft-label, but they are complementary. (ii) Using LAD,\na smaller teacher can also improve a larger student significantly, while\nsoft-label can't. We then introduce Co-learning LAD, in which two networks\nsimultaneously learn from scratch and the role of teacher and student are\ndynamically interchanged.

Besides the\nstandard plights in training deep architectures such as vanishing gradients and\noverfitting, the training of deep GNNs also uniquely suffers from\nover-smoothing, information squashing, and so on, which limits their potential\npower on large-scale graphs. Although numerous efforts are proposed to address\nthese limitations, such as various forms of skip connections, graph\nnormalization, and random dropping, it is difficult to disentangle the\nadvantages brought by a deep GNN architecture from those \"tricks\" necessary to\ntrain such an architecture. Moreover, the lack of a standardized benchmark with\nfair and consistent experimental settings poses an almost insurmountable\nobstacle to gauging the effectiveness of new mechanisms. In view of those, we\npresent the first fair and reproducible benchmark dedicated to assessing the\n\"tricks\" of training deep GNNs. We categorize existing approaches, investigate\ntheir hyperparameter sensitivity, and unify the basic configuration.\nComprehensive evaluations are then conducted on tens of representative graph\ndatasets including the recent large-scale Open Graph Benchmark (OGB), with\ndiverse deep GNN backbones. Based on synergistic studies, we discover the combo\nof superior training tricks, that lead us to attain the new state-of-the-art\nresults for deep GCNs, across multiple representative graph datasets. We\ndemonstrate that an organic combo of initial connection, identity mapping,\ngroup and batch normalization has the most ideal performance on large datasets.\nExperiments also reveal a number of \"surprises\" when combining or scaling up\nsome of the tricks.

    "abstract": "RGB-D semantic segmentation has attracted increasing attention over the past\nfew years. Existing methods mostly employ homogeneous convolution operators to\nconsume the RGB and depth features, ignoring their intrinsic differences. In\nfact, the RGB values capture the photometric appearance properties in the\nprojected image space, while the depth feature encodes both the shape of a\nlocal geometry as well as the base (whereabout) of it in a larger context.\nCompared with the base, the shape probably is more inherent and has a stronger\nconnection to the semantics, and thus is more critical for segmentation\naccuracy. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a Shape-aware\nConvolutional layer (ShapeConv) for processing the depth feature, where the\ndepth feature is firstly decomposed into a shape-component and a\nbase-component, next two learnable weights are introduced to cooperate with\nthem independently, and finally a convolution is applied on the re-weighted\ncombination of these two components. ShapeConv is model-agnostic and can be\neasily integrated into most CNNs to replace vanilla convolutional layers for\nsemantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on three challenging indoor RGB-D\nsemantic segmentation benchmarks, i.e., NYU-Dv2(-13,-40), SUN RGB-D, and SID,\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our ShapeConv when employing it over five\npopular architectures. Moreover, the performance of CNNs with ShapeConv is\nboosted without introducing any computation and memory increase in the\ninference phase. The reason is that the learnt weights for balancing the\nimportance between the shape and base components in ShapeConv become constants\nin the inference phase, and thus can be fused into the following convolution,\nresulting in a network that is identical to one with vanilla convolutional\nlayers.",

It is trained using a video stream and\ncorresponding synchronized sparse point cloud, as obtained from a LIDAR or\nother range sensor, along with the intrinsic calibration parameters of the\ncamera. At inference time, the calibration of the camera, which can be\ndifferent than the one used for training, is fed as an input to the network\nalong with the sparse point cloud and a single image. A Calibrated\nBackprojection Layer backprojects each pixel in the image to three-dimensional\nspace using the calibration matrix and a depth feature descriptor. The\nresulting 3D positional encoding is concatenated with the image descriptor and\nthe previous layer output to yield the input to the next layer of the encoder.\nA decoder, exploiting skip-connections, produces a dense depth map.

The 5G millimeter\nwave (mmWave) communication technology can enhance the environment sensing\nability of different isolated vehicles. In this paper, a joint sensing and\ncommunication integrated system (JSCIS) is designed to support the dynamic\nframe structure configuration for sensing and communication dual functions\nbased on the 5G New Radio protocol in the mmWave frequency band, which can\nsolve the low latency and high data rate problems of raw sensing data sharing\namong CAVs. To evaluate the timeliness of raw sensing data transmission, the\nbest time duration allocation ratio of sensing and communication dual functions\nfor one vehicle is achieved by modeling the M/M/1 queuing problem using the age\nof information (AoI) in this paper. Furthermore, the resource allocation\noptimization problem among multiple CAVs is formulated as a non-cooperative\ngame using the radar mutual information as a key indicator. And the feasibility\nand existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) are proved theoretically,\nand a centralized time resource allocation (CTRA) algorithm is proposed to\nachieve the best feasible pure strategy NE. Finally, both simulation and\nhardware testbed are designed, and the results show that the proposed CTRA\nalgorithm can improve the radar total mutual information by 26%, and the\nfeasibility of the proposed JSCIS is achieved with an acceptable radar ranging\naccuracy within 0.25 mm, as well as a stable data rate of 2.8 Gbps using the 28\nGHz mmWave frequency band.",

    "abstract": "By providing explanations for users and system designers to facilitate better\nunderstanding and decision making, explainable recommendation has been an\nimportant research problem. In this paper, we propose Counterfactual\nExplainable Recommendation (CountER), which takes the insights of\ncounterfactual reasoning from causal inference for explainable recommendation.\nCountER is able to formulate the complexity and the strength of explanations,\nand it adopts a counterfactual learning framework to seek simple (low\ncomplexity) and effective (high strength) explanations for the model decision.\nTechnically, for each item recommended to each user, CountER formulates a joint\noptimization problem to generate minimal changes on the item aspects so as to\ncreate a counterfactual item, such that the recommendation decision on the\ncounterfactual item is reversed. These altered aspects constitute the\nexplanation of why the original item is recommended. The counterfactual\nexplanation helps both the users for better understanding and the system\ndesigners for better model debugging. Another contribution of the work is the\nevaluation of explainable recommendation, which has been a challenging task.\nFortunately, counterfactual explanations are very suitable for standard\nquantitative evaluation. To measure the explanation quality, we design two\ntypes of evaluation metrics, one from user's perspective (i.e. why the user\nlikes the item), and the other from model's perspective (i.e. why the item is\nrecommended by the model). We apply our counterfactual learning algorithm on a\nblack-box recommender system and evaluate the generated explanations on five\nreal-world datasets. Results show that our model generates more accurate and\neffective explanations than state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models.",

    "abstract": "Joins in native graph database management systems (GDBMSs) are predefined to\nthe system as edges, which are indexed in adjacency list indices and serve as\npointers. This contrasts with and can be more performant than value-based joins\nin RDBMSs and has lead researchers to investigate ways to integrate predefined\njoins directly into RDBMSs. Existing approaches adopt a strict separation of\ngraph and relational data and processors, where a graph-specific processor uses\nleft-deep and index nested loop joins for a subset of joins. This may be\nsuboptimal, and may lead to non-sequential scans of data in some queries. We\npropose a purely relational approach to integrate predefined joins in columnar\nRDBMSs that uses row IDs (RIDs) of tuples as pointers. Users can predefine\nequality joins between any two tables, which leads to materializing RIDs in\nextended tables and optionally in RID indices. Instead of using the RID index\nto perform the join directly, we use it primarily in hash joins to generate\nsemi-join filters that can be passed to scans using sideways information\npassing, ensuring sequential scans. In some settings, we also use RID indices\nto reduce the number of joins in query plans. Our approach does not introduce\nany graph-specific system components, can execute predefined joins on any join\nplan, and can improve performance on any workload that contains equality joins\nthat can be predefined. We integrated our approach to DuckDB and call the\nresulting system {\\em GRainDB}. We demonstrate that GRainDB far improves the\nperformance of DuckDB on relational and graph workloads with large many-to-many\njoins, making it competitive with a state-of-the-art GDBMS, and incurs no major\noverheads otherwise.",

A remarkable theorem of Newman-Sohler (SICOMP\n2013) asserts that all properties of planar graphs (more generally hyperfinite)\nare testable with query complexity only depending on $\\varepsilon$. Recent\nadvances in testing minor-freeness have proven that all additive and monotone\nproperties of planar graphs can be tested in $poly(\\varepsilon^{-1})$ queries.\nSome properties falling outside this class, such as Hamiltonicity, also have a\nsimilar complexity for planar graphs. Motivated by these results, we ask: can\nall properties of planar graphs can be tested in $poly(\\varepsilon^{-1})$\nqueries? Is there a uniform query complexity upper bound for all planar\nproperties, and what is the \"hardest\" such property to test? We discover a\nsurprisingly clean and optimal answer. Any property of bounded degree planar\ngraphs can be tested in $\\exp(O(\\varepsilon^{-2}))$ queries. Moreover, there is\na matching lower bound, up to constant factors in the exponent. The natural\nproperty of testing isomorphism to a fixed graph needs\n$\\exp(\\Omega(\\varepsilon^{-2}))$ queries, thereby showing that (up to\npolynomial dependencies) isomorphism to an explicit fixed graph is the hardest\nproperty of planar graphs. The upper bound is a straightforward adapation of\nthe Newman-Sohler analysis that tracks dependencies on $\\varepsilon$ carefully.\nThe main technical contribution is the lower bound construction, which is\nachieved by a special family of planar graphs that are all mutually far from\neach other. We can also apply our techniques to get analogous results for\nbounded treewidth graphs. We prove that all properties of bounded treewidth\ngraphs can be tested in $\\exp(O(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log \\varepsilon^{-1}))$\nqueries.

    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation targets next-item prediction by exploiting user\nbehaviors within a short time period. Compared with other recommendation\nparadigms, session-based recommendation suffers more from the problem of data\nsparsity due to the very limited short-term interactions. Self-supervised\nlearning, which can discover ground-truth samples from the raw data, holds vast\npotentials to tackle this problem. However, existing self-supervised\nrecommendation models mainly rely on item/segment dropout to augment data,\nwhich are not fit for session-based recommendation because the dropout leads to\nsparser data, creating unserviceable self-supervision signals. In this paper,\nfor informative session-based data augmentation, we combine self-supervised\nlearning with co-training, and then develop a framework to enhance\nsession-based recommendation. Technically, we first exploit the session-based\ngraph to augment two views that exhibit the internal and external\nconnectivities of sessions, and then we build two distinct graph encoders over\nthe two views, which recursively leverage the different connectivity\ninformation to generate ground-truth samples to supervise each other by\ncontrastive learning. In contrast to the dropout strategy, the proposed\nself-supervised graph co-training preserves the complete session information\nand fulfills genuine data augmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmark datasets show that, session-based recommendation can be remarkably\nenhanced under the regime of self-supervised graph co-training, achieving the\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "This thesis investigates the controllability of deep learning-based,\nend-to-end, generative dialogue systems in both task-oriented and chit-chat\nscenarios. In particular, we study the different aspects of controlling\ngenerative dialogue systems, including controlling styles and topics and\ncontinuously adding and combining dialogue skills. In the three decades since\nthe first dialogue system was commercialized, the basic architecture of such\nsystems has remained substantially unchanged, consisting of four pipelined\nbasic components, namely, natural language understanding (NLU), dialogue state\ntracking (DST), a dialogue manager (DM) and natural language generation (NLG).\nThe dialogue manager, which is the critical component of the modularized\nsystem, controls the response content and style. This module is usually\nprogrammed by rules and is designed to be highly controllable and easily\nextendable. With the emergence of powerful \"deep learning\" architectures,\nend-to-end generative dialogue systems have been proposed to optimize overall\nsystem performance and simplify training. However, these systems cannot be\neasily controlled and extended as the modularized dialogue manager can. This is\nbecause a single neural system is used, which is usually a large pre-trained\nlanguage model (e.g., GPT-2), and thus it is hard to surgically change\ndesirable attributes (e.g., style, topics, etc.). More importantly,\nuncontrollable dialogue systems can generate offensive and even toxic\nresponses. Therefore, in this thesis, we study controllable methods for\nend-to-end generative dialogue systems in task-oriented and chit-chat\nscenarios. Throughout the chapters, we describe 1) how to control the style and\ntopics of chit-chat models, 2) how to continuously control and extend\ntask-oriented dialogue systems, and 3) how to compose and control multi-skill\ndialogue models.",

    "title": "An Efficient ADER-DG Local Time Stepping Scheme for 3D HPC Simulation of  Seismic Waves in Poroelastic Media",
    "abstract": "Many applications from geosciences require simulations of seismic waves in\nporous media. Biot's theory of poroelasticity describes the coupling between\nsolid and fluid phases and introduces a stiff source term, thereby increasing\ncomputational cost and motivating efficient methods utilising High-Performance\nComputing. We present a novel realisation of the discontinuous Galerkin scheme\nwith Arbitrary DERivative time stepping (ADER-DG) that copes with stiff source\nterms.\nTo integrate this source term with a reasonable time step size, we use an\nelement-local space-time predictor, which needs to solve medium-sized linear\nsystems - with 1000 to 10000 unknowns - in each element update (i.e., billions\nof times). We present a novel block-wise back-substitution algorithm for\nsolving these systems efficiently. In comparison to LU decomposition, we reduce\nthe number of floating-point operations by a factor of up to 25. The block-wise\nback-substitution is mapped to a sequence of small matrix-matrix\nmultiplications, for which code generators are available to generate highly\noptimised code.\nWe verify the new solver thoroughly in problems of increasing complexity. We\ndemonstrate high-order convergence for 3D problems. We verify the correct\ntreatment of point sources, material interfaces and traction-free boundary\nconditions. In addition, we compare against a finite difference code for a\nnewly defined layer over half-space problem. We find that extremely high\naccuracy is required to resolve the slow P-wave at a free surface, while solid\nparticle velocities are not affected by coarser resolutions. By using a\nclustered local time stepping scheme, we reduce time to solution by a factor of\n6 to 10 compared to global time stepping. We conclude our study with a scaling\nand performance analysis, demonstrating our implementation's efficiency and its\npotential for extreme-scale simulations.",

Current models formulate a\nreduction of that multilabel setting into either multiple binary\nclassifications or multiclass classification, allowing for the use of existing\nloss functions (sigmoid, cross-entropy, logistic, etc.). Empirically, these\nmethods have been reported to achieve good performance on different metrics (F1\nscore, Recall, Precision, etc.). Theoretically though, the multilabel\nclassification reductions does not accommodate for the prediction of varying\nnumbers of labels per example and the underlying losses are distant estimates\nof the performance metrics.\nWe propose a loss function, sigmoidF1. It is an approximation of the F1 score\nthat (I) is smooth and tractable for stochastic gradient descent, (II)\nnaturally approximates a multilabel metric, (III) estimates label propensities\nand label counts. More generally, we show that any confusion matrix metric can\nbe formulated with a smooth surrogate. We evaluate the proposed loss function\non different text and image datasets, and with a variety of metrics, to account\nfor the complexity of multilabel classification evaluation.

However, such approaches are insufficient in precision and\ncomputational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel insider threat\ndetection method, Image-based Insider Threat Detector via Geometric\nTransformation (IGT), which converts the unsupervised anomaly detection into\nsupervised image classification task, and therefore the performance can be\nboosted via computer vision techniques. To illustrate, our IGT uses a novel\nimage-based feature representation of user behavior by transforming audit logs\ninto grayscale images. By applying multiple geometric transformations on these\nbehavior grayscale images, IGT constructs a self-labelled dataset and then\ntrain a behavior classifier to detect anomaly in self-supervised manner. The\nmotivation behind our proposed method is that images converted from normal\nbehavior data may contain unique latent features which keep unchanged after\ngeometric transformation, while malicious ones cannot. Experimental results on\nCERT dataset show IGT outperforms the classical autoencoder-based unsupervised\ninsider threat detection approaches, and improves the instance and user based\nArea under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) by 4% and 2%,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Due to its mobility and agility, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has emerged as\na promising technology for various tasks, such as sensing, inspection and\ndelivery. However, a typical UAV has limited energy storage and cannot fly a\nlong distance without being recharged. This motivates several existing\nproposals to use trucks and other ground vehicles to offer riding to help UAVs\nsave energy and expand the operation radius. We present the first theoretical\nstudy regarding how UAVs should optimally hitch on ground vehicles, considering\nvehicles' different travelling patterns and supporting capabilities. For a\nsingle UAV, we derive closed-form optimal vehicle selection and hitching\nstrategy. When vehicles only support hitching, a UAV would prefer the vehicle\nthat can carry it closest to its final destination. When vehicles can offer\nhitching plus charging, the UAV may hitch on a vehicle that carries it farther\naway from its destination and hitch a longer distance. The UAV may also prefer\nto hitch on a slower vehicle for the benefit of battery recharging. For\nmultiple UAVs in need of hitching, we develop the max-saving algorithm (MSA) to\noptimally match UAV-vehicle collaboration. We prove that the MSA globally\noptimizes the total hitching benefits for the UAVs.",

We prove that functions satisfying this property can be\nlearned in polynomial time using layerwise stochastic coordinate descent on\nregular neural networks -- a class of network architectures and initializations\nthat have homogeneity properties. Our analysis shows that for such staircase\nfunctions and neural networks, the gradient-based algorithm learns high-level\nfeatures by greedily combining lower-level features along the depth of the\nnetwork. We further back our theoretical results with experiments showing that\nstaircase functions are also learnable by more standard ResNet architectures\nwith stochastic gradient descent.

In other\nwords, it is a challenging problem to design a universal pooling architecture\nto perform well in most cases, leading to a demand for data-specific pooling\nmethods in real-world applications. To address this problem, we propose to use\nneural architecture search (NAS) to search for adaptive pooling architectures\nfor graph classification.

    "abstract": "Deep learning is widely used in the most recent automatic sleep scoring\nalgorithms. Its popularity stems from its excellent performance and from its\nability to directly process raw signals and to learn feature from the data.\nMost of the existing scoring algorithms exploit very computationally demanding\narchitectures, due to their high number of training parameters, and process\nlengthy time sequences in input (up to 12 minutes). Only few of these\narchitectures provide an estimate of the model uncertainty. In this study we\npropose DeepSleepNet-Lite, a simplified and lightweight scoring architecture,\nprocessing only 90-seconds EEG input sequences. We exploit, for the first time\nin sleep scoring, the Monte Carlo dropout technique to enhance the performance\nof the architecture and to also detect the uncertain instances. The evaluation\nis performed on a single-channel EEG Fpz-Cz from the open source Sleep-EDF\nexpanded database. DeepSleepNet-Lite achieves slightly lower performance, if\nnot on par, compared to the existing state-of-the-art architectures, in overall\naccuracy, macro F1-score and Cohen's kappa (on Sleep-EDF v1-2013 +/-30mins:\n84.0%, 78.0%, 0.78; on Sleep-EDF v2-2018 +/-30mins: 80.3%, 75.2%, 0.73). Monte\nCarlo dropout enables the estimate of the uncertain predictions. By rejecting\nthe uncertain instances, the model achieves higher performance on both versions\nof the database (on Sleep-EDF v1-2013 +/-30mins: 86.1.0%, 79.6%, 0.81; on\nSleep-EDF v2-2018 +/-30mins: 82.3%, 76.7%, 0.76). Our lighter sleep scoring\napproach paves the way to the application of scoring algorithms for sleep\nanalysis in real-time.",

BSDEs in applications are often nonlinear and high-dimensional. In\nnearly all cases such nonlinear high-dimensional BSDEs cannot be solved\nexplicitly and it has been and still is a very active topic of research to\ndesign and analyze numerical approximation methods to approximatively solve\nnonlinear high-dimensional BSDEs. Although there are a large number of research\narticles in the scientific literature which analyze numerical approximation\nmethods for nonlinear BSDEs, until today there has been no numerical\napproximation method in the scientific literature which has been proven to\novercome the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of\nnonlinear BSDEs in the sense that the number of computational operations of the\nnumerical approximation method to approximatively compute one sample path of\nthe BSDE solution grows at most polynomially in both the reciprocal $1/\n\\varepsilon$ of the prescribed approximation accuracy $\\varepsilon \\in\n(0,\\infty)$ and the dimension $d\\in \\mathbb N=\\{1,2,3,\\ldots\\}$ of the BSDE. It\nis the key contribution of this article to overcome this obstacle by\nintroducing a new Monte Carlo-type numerical approximation method for\nhigh-dimensional BSDEs and by proving that this Monte Carlo-type numerical\napproximation method does indeed overcome the curse of dimensionality in the\napproximative computation of solution paths of BSDEs.",

    "abstract": "The inaccessibility of user-perceived reality remains an open issue in\npursuing the accurate calibration of optical see-through (OST) head-mounted\ndisplays (HMDs). Manual user alignment is usually required to collect a set of\nvirtual-to-real correspondences, so that a default or an offline display\ncalibration can be updated to account for the user's eye position(s). Current\nalignment-based calibration procedures usually require point-wise alignments\nbetween rendered image point(s) and associated physical landmark(s) of a target\ncalibration tool. As each alignment can only provide one or a few\ncorrespondences, repeated alignments are required to ensure calibration\nquality.\nThis work presents an accurate and tool-less online OST calibration method to\nupdate an offline-calibrated eye-display model. The user's bare hand is\nmarkerlessly tracked by a commercial RGBD camera anchored to the OST headset to\ngenerate a user-specific cursor for correspondence collection. The required\nalignment is object-wise, and can provide thousands of unordered corresponding\npoints in tracked space. The collected correspondences are registered by a\nproposed rotation-constrained iterative closest point (rcICP) method to\noptimise the viewpoint-related calibration parameters. We implemented such a\nmethod for the Microsoft HoloLens 1. The resiliency of the proposed procedure\nto noisy data was evaluated through simulated tests and real experiments\nperformed with an eye-replacement camera. According to the simulation test, the\nrcICP registration is robust against possible user-induced rotational\nmisalignment. With a single alignment, our method achieves 8.81 arcmin (1.37\nmm) positional error and 1.76 degree rotational error by camera-based tests in\nthe arm-reach distance, and 10.79 arcmin (7.71 pixels) reprojection error by\nuser tests.",

Visual tracking has\nrecently been proposed to measure the target anatomy in a markerless and\neffortless way, but the existing methods fail under real-world occlusion caused\nby intraoperative interventions. Furthermore, such methods are\nhardware-specific and not accurate enough for surgical applications. In this\npaper, we propose a RGB-D sensing-based markerless tracking method that is\nrobust against occlusion. We design a new segmentation network that features\ndynamic region-of-interest prediction and robust 3D point cloud segmentation.\nAs it is expensive to collect large-scale training data with occlusion\ninstances, we also propose a new method to create synthetic RGB-D images for\nnetwork training. Experimental results show that our proposed markerless\ntracking method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches by a large\nmargin, especially when an occlusion exists. Furthermore, our method\ngeneralises well to new cameras and new target models, including a cadaver,\nwithout the need for network retraining.

MR data have been widely used\nto localize outdoor mobile devices for human mobility analysis, urban planning,\nand traffic forecasting. Existing works using first-order sequence models such\nas the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) attempt to capture spatio-temporal locality in\nunderlying mobility patterns for lower localization errors. The HMM approaches\ntypically assume stable mobility patterns of the underlying mobile devices.

Thus, the existing solutions\ncannot handle these heterogeneous mobility patterns. we propose a multi-task\nlearning-based deep neural network (DNN) framework, namely PRNet+, to\nincorporate outdoor position recovery and transportation mode detection. To\nmake sure the framework work, PRNet+ develops a feature extraction module to\nprecisely learn local-, short- and long-term spatio-temporal locality from\nheterogeneous MR samples.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of gathering data from large-scale\nwireless sensor networks using multiple unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) to gather\ndata at designated rendezvouses, where the goal is to maximize the network\nlifetime. Previous proposals often consider a practical approach where the\nproblem of determining a data gathering scheme is decomposed into 2\nsub-problems: i) partitioning the networks into clusters for determining the\nrendezvouses as these obtained cluster heads; and ii) determining the paths for\na set of a given number of UAVs to come gathering data at these rendezvouses\nwhich have been harvesting data within each local clusters, respectively. We\ntry to deal with this as a whole optimization problem, expecting a significant\nincrease in computation complexity which would bring new challenge in creating\npractical solutions for large-scale WSNs. We introduce two alternatives\nmixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations, namely the 2-index model\nwith $O(n^2)$ variables and the 3-index model that has $O(n^3)$ variables,\nwhere $n$ denotes the number of sensor nodes. We show that our best model could\nsolve optimally the problem instances with up to 50 sensor nodes in less than\n30 minutes. Next, we propose a heuristic idea to reduce the number of variables\nin implementing the 3-index model to effectively handle larger-scale networks\nwith size in hundreds.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the fast growth in telecommunication (Telco)\ntechniques from 2G to upcoming 5G. Precise outdoor localization is important\nfor Telco operators to manage, operate and optimize Telco networks. Differing\nfrom GPS, Telco localization is a technique employed by Telco operators to\nlocalize outdoor mobile devices by using measurement report (MR) data. When\ngiven MR samples containing noisy signals (e.g., caused by Telco signal\ninterference and attenuation), Telco localization often suffers from high\nerrors. To this end, the main focus of this paper is how to improve Telco\nlocalization accuracy via the algorithms to detect and repair outlier positions\nwith high errors. Specifically, we propose a context-aware Telco localization\ntechnique, namely RLoc, which consists of three main components: a\nmachine-learning-based localization algorithm, a detection algorithm to find\nflawed samples, and a repair algorithm to replace outlier localization results\nby better ones (ideally ground truth positions). Unlike most existing works to\ndetect and repair every flawed MR sample independently, we instead take into\naccount spatio-temporal locality of MR locations and exploit trajectory context\nto detect and repair flawed positions. Our experiments on the real MR data sets\nfrom 2G GSM and 4G LTE Telco networks verify that our work RLoc can greatly\nimprove Telco location accuracy. For example, RLoc on a large 4G MR data set\ncan achieve 32.2 meters of median errors, around 17.4% better than\nstate-of-the-art.",

Recently, deep learning methods have been emerged in the artificial\nintelligence field attaining astonishing performance in a wide range of\napplications. Yet, the evidence about their performance in to solve the energy\nTSF problems, in terms of accuracy and computational requirements, is scanty.\nMost of the review articles that handle the energy TSF problem are systematic\nreviews, however, a qualitative and quantitative study for the energy TSF\nproblem is not yet available in the literature. The purpose of this paper is\ntwofold, first it provides a comprehensive analytical assessment for\nconventional,machine learning, and deep learning methods that can be utilized\nto solve various energy TSF problems. Second, the paper carries out an\nempirical assessment for many selected methods through three real-world\ndatasets.

Even so, measuring quality presents many methodological\nchallenges.

In this context, we aim to jointly optimize the input covariance\nmatrix and the IRS phase shifts to maximize the achievable secrecy rate of the\nconsidered system. To solve the formulated problem which is non-convex, we\npropose an iterative method based on the block successive maximization (BSM),\nwhere each iteration is done in closed form. More specifically, we maximize a\nlower bound on the achievable secrecy rate to update the input covariance\nmatrix for fixed phase shifts, and then maximize the (exact) achievable secrecy\nrate to update phase shifts for a given input covariance.We consider the total\nfree space path loss (FSPL) in this system to emphasize the first-order measure\nof the applicability of the IRS in the considered communication system. We\npresent a convergence proof and the associated complexity analysis of the\nproposed algorithm. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method compared to a known solution, and also to\nshow the effect of different parameters of interest on the achievable secrecy\nrate of the IRS-assisted MIMOME WTC.",

    "abstract": "The sequential structure of language, and the order of words in a sentence\nspecifically, plays a central role in human language processing. Consequently,\nin designing computational models of language, the de facto approach is to\npresent sentences to machines with the words ordered in the same order as in\nthe original human-authored sentence. The very essence of this work is to\nquestion the implicit assumption that this is desirable and inject theoretical\nsoundness into the consideration of word order in natural language processing.\nIn this thesis, we begin by uniting the disparate treatments of word order in\ncognitive science, psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, and natural\nlanguage processing under a flexible algorithmic framework. We proceed to use\nthis heterogeneous theoretical foundation as the basis for exploring new word\norders with an undercurrent of psycholinguistic optimality. In particular, we\nfocus on notions of dependency length minimization given the difficulties in\nhuman and computational language processing in handling long-distance\ndependencies. We then discuss algorithms for finding optimal word orders\nefficiently in spite of the combinatorial space of possibilities. We conclude\nby addressing the implications of these word orders on human language and their\ndownstream impacts when integrated in computational models.",

    "abstract": "Traditional oversampling methods are generally employed to handle class\nimbalance in datasets. This oversampling approach is independent of the\nclassifier; thus, it does not offer an end-to-end solution. To overcome this,\nwe propose a three-player adversarial game-based end-to-end method, where a\ndomain-constraints mixture of generators, a discriminator, and a multi-class\nclassifier are used. Rather than adversarial minority oversampling, we propose\nan adversarial oversampling (AO) and a data-space oversampling (DO) approach.\nIn AO, the generator updates by fooling both the classifier and discriminator,\nhowever, in DO, it updates by favoring the classifier and fooling the\ndiscriminator. While updating the classifier, it considers both the real and\nsynthetically generated samples in AO. But, in DO, it favors the real samples\nand fools the subset class-specific generated samples. To mitigate the biases\nof a classifier towards the majority class, minority samples are over-sampled\nat a fractional rate. Such implementation is shown to provide more robust\nclassification boundaries. The effectiveness of our proposed method has been\nvalidated with high-dimensional, highly imbalanced and large-scale multi-class\ntabular datasets. The results as measured by average class specific accuracy\n(ACSA) clearly indicate that the proposed method provides better classification\naccuracy (improvement in the range of 0.7% to 49.27%) as compared to the\nbaseline classifier.",

    "abstract": "Social media like Twitter provide a common platform to share and communicate\npersonal experiences with other people. People often post their life\nexperiences, local news, and events on social media to inform others. Many\nrescue agencies monitor this type of data regularly to identify disasters and\nreduce the risk of lives. However, it is impossible for humans to manually\ncheck the mass amount of data and identify disasters in real-time. For this\npurpose, many research works have been proposed to present words in\nmachine-understandable representations and apply machine learning methods on\nthe word representations to identify the sentiment of a text. The previous\nresearch methods provide a single representation or embedding of a word from a\ngiven document. However, the recent advanced contextual embedding method (BERT)\nconstructs different vectors for the same word in different contexts. BERT\nembeddings have been successfully used in different natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks, yet there is no concrete analysis of how these representations are\nhelpful in disaster-type tweet analysis. In this research work, we explore the\nefficacy of BERT embeddings on predicting disaster from Twitter data and\ncompare these to traditional context-free word embedding methods (GloVe,\nSkip-gram, and FastText). We use both traditional machine learning methods and\ndeep learning methods for this purpose. We provide both quantitative and\nqualitative results for this study. The results show that the BERT embeddings\nhave the best results in disaster prediction task than the traditional word\nembeddings. Our codes are made freely accessible to the research community.",

    "abstract": "Many applications in important problem domains such as machine learning and\ncomputer vision are streaming applications that take a sequence of inputs over\ntime. It is challenging to find knob settings that optimize the run-time\nperformance of such applications because the optimal knob settings are usually\nfunctions of inputs, computing platforms, time as well as user's requirements,\nwhich can be very diverse.\nMost prior works address this problem by offline profiling followed by\ntraining models for control. However, profiling-based approaches incur large\noverhead before execution; it is also difficult to redeploy them in other\nrun-time configurations.\nIn this paper, we propose Sonic, a sampling-based online controller for\nlong-running streaming applications that does not require profiling ahead of\ntime. Within each phase of a streaming application's execution, Sonic utilizes\nthe beginning portion to sample the knob space strategically and aims to pick\nthe optimal knob setting for the rest of the phase, given a user-specified\nconstrained optimization problem. A hybrid approach of machine learning\nregressions and Bayesian optimization are used for better overall sampling\nchoices.\nSonic is implemented independent of application, device, input, performance\nobjective and constraints. We evaluate Sonic on traditional parallel benchmarks\nas well as on deep learning inference benchmarks across multiple platforms. Our\nexperiments show that when using Sonic to control knob settings, application\nrun-time performance is only 5.3% less than if optimal knob settings were used,\ndemonstrating that Sonic is able to find near-optimal knob settings under\ndiverse run-time configurations without prior knowledge quickly.",

We propose a method to overcome these\nlimitations. Our method has two main parts to it. The first is to ensure that\nthe tuning problem has a single unique solution. We achieve this by\nsimultaneously tuning the filter over multiple different prediction intervals.\nAlthough this yields a unique solution, practical issues (such as sampling\nnoise) mean that it cannot be directly applied.

This\nwork presents an explainability analysis and evaluation of a prediction model\nfor heart failure survival by using a dataset that comprises 299 patients who\nsuffered heart failure. The model employs a data workflow pipeline able to\nselect the best ensemble tree algorithm as well as the best feature selection\ntechnique. Moreover, different post-hoc techniques have been used for the\nexplainability analysis of the model. The paper's main contribution is an\nexplainability-driven approach to select the best prediction model for HF\nsurvival based on an accuracy-explainability balance. Therefore, the most\nbalanced explainable prediction model implements an Extra Trees classifier over\n5 selected features (follow-up time, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, age\nand diabetes) out of 12, achieving a balanced-accuracy of 85.1% and 79.5% with\ncross-validation and new unseen data respectively.

    "abstract": "Though 3D object detection from point clouds has achieved rapid progress in\nrecent years, the lack of flexible and high-performance proposal refinement\nremains a great hurdle for existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.\nPrevious works on refining 3D proposals have relied on human-designed\ncomponents such as keypoints sampling, set abstraction and multi-scale feature\nfusion to produce powerful 3D object representations. Such methods, however,\nhave limited ability to capture rich contextual dependencies among points. In\nthis paper, we leverage the high-quality region proposal network and a\nChannel-wise Transformer architecture to constitute our two-stage 3D object\ndetection framework (CT3D) with minimal hand-crafted design. The proposed CT3D\nsimultaneously performs proposal-aware embedding and channel-wise context\naggregation for the point features within each proposal. Specifically, CT3D\nuses proposal's keypoints for spatial contextual modelling and learns attention\npropagation in the encoding module, mapping the proposal to point embeddings.\nNext, a new channel-wise decoding module enriches the query-key interaction via\nchannel-wise re-weighting to effectively merge multi-level contexts, which\ncontributes to more accurate object predictions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our CT3D method has superior performance and excellent\nscalability. Remarkably, CT3D achieves the AP of 81.77% in the moderate car\ncategory on the KITTI test 3D detection benchmark, outperforms state-of-the-art\n3D detectors.",

    "abstract": "In this research, we investigate techniques to detect hate speech in movies.\nWe introduce a new dataset collected from the subtitles of six movies, where\neach utterance is annotated either as hate, offensive or normal. We apply\ntransfer learning techniques of domain adaptation and fine-tuning on existing\nsocial media datasets, namely from Twitter and Fox News. We evaluate different\nrepresentations, i.e., Bag of Words (BoW), Bi-directional Long short-term\nmemory (Bi-LSTM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\n(BERT) on 11k movie subtitles. The BERT model obtained the best macro-averaged\nF1-score of 77%. Hence, we show that transfer learning from the social media\ndomain is efficacious in classifying hate and offensive speech in movies\nthrough subtitles.",

Following a Transfer Learning\napproach, we utilize the pre-trained Transformer-based XLNet model to classify\ntweets as Misleading or Non-Misleading and validate against a random subset of\nresults manually. We build on this to study and contrast the characteristics of\ntweets in the corpus that are misleading in nature against non-misleading ones.\nThis exploratory analysis enables us to design features (such as sentiments,\nhashtags, nouns, pronouns, etc) that can, in turn, be exploited for classifying\ntweets as (Non-)Misleading using various ML models in an explainable manner.\nSpecifically, several ML models are employed for prediction, with up to 90%\naccuracy, and the importance of each feature is explained using SHAP\nExplainable AI (XAI) tool. While the thrust of this work is principally\nexploratory analysis in order to obtain insights on the online discourse on\nCovid-19 vaccination, we conclude the paper by outlining how these insights\nprovide the foundations for a more actionable approach to mitigate\nmisinformation.

To\navoid data exchange with ground-based processing nodes, a federated learning\napproach is adopted between a UAV leader and the swarm members to improve the\nlocal learning model while avoiding excessive air-to-ground and ground-to-air\ncommunications. Moreover, the proposed deployment framework considers the\nstringent energy constraints of UAVs and the problem of class imbalance, where\nwe show that considering these design parameters significantly improves the\nperformances of the UAV swarm in terms of classification accuracy, energy\nconsumption and availability of UAVs when compared with several baseline\nalgorithms.",

Such methods can ease the modelling burden in control design\nbut can be sensitive to disturbances acting on the system under control. In\nthis paper, we extend these methods to incorporate segmented prediction\ntrajectories. The proposed segmentation enables longer prediction horizons to\nbe used in the presence of unmeasured disturbance. Furthermore, a computation\ntime reduction can be achieved through segmentation by exploiting the problem\nstructure, with computation time scaling linearly with increasing horizon\nlength. The performance characteristics are illustrated in a set-point tracking\ncase study in which the segmented formulation enables more consistent\nperformance over a wide range of prediction horizons. The computation time for\nthe segmented formulation is approximately half that of an unsegmented\nformulation for a horizon of 100 samples. The method is then applied to a\nbuilding energy management problem, using a detailed simulation environment, in\nwhich we seek to minimise the discomfort and energy of a 6-room apartment. With\nthe segmented formulation, a 72% reduction in discomfort and 5% financial cost\nreduction is achieved, compared to an unsegmented formulation using a\none-day-ahead prediction horizon.",

Deep neural\nnetworks have to learn new tasks and overcome forgetting the knowledge obtained\nfrom the old tasks as the amount of data keeps increasing in applications. In\nthis article, two continual learning scenarios will be proposed to describe the\npotential challenges in this context. Besides, based on our previous work\nregarding the CLeaR framework, which is short for continual learning for\nregression tasks, the work will be further developed to enable models to extend\nthemselves and learn data successively. Research topics are related but not\nlimited to developing continual deep learning algorithms, strategies for\nnon-stationarity detection in data streams, explainable and visualizable\nartificial intelligence, etc. Moreover, the framework- and algorithm-related\nhyperparameters should be dynamically updated in applications. Forecasting\nexperiments will be conducted based on power generation and consumption data\ncollected from real-world applications.

From the numerical\nresults, we observe optimum points for both the constellation altitude and the\nnumber of orthogonal frequency channels; interestingly, the optimum user's\nlatitude is greater than the inclination angle due to the presence of fewer\ninterfering satellites.

    "abstract": "The Polyline Bundle Simplification (PBS) problem is a generalization of the\nclassical polyline simplification problem. Given a set of polylines, which may\nshare line segments and points, PBS asks for the smallest consistent\nsimplification of these polylines with respect to a given distance threshold.\nHere, consistent means that each point is either kept in or discarded from all\npolylines containing it. In previous work, it was proven that PBS is NP-hard to\napproximate within a factor of $n^{\\frac{1}{3}-\\varepsilon}$ for any\n$\\varepsilon > 0$ where $n$ denotes the number of points in the input. This\nhardness result holds even for two polylines. In this paper we first study the\npractically relevant setting of planar inputs. While for many combinatorial\noptimization problems the restriction to planar settings makes the problem\nsubstantially easier, we show that the inapproximability bound known for\ngeneral inputs continues to hold even for planar inputs. We proceed with the\ninteresting special case of PBS where the polylines form a rooted tree. Such\ntree bundles naturally arise in the context of movement data visualization. We\nprove that optimal simplifications of these tree bundles can be computed in\n$O(n^3)$ for the Fr\\'echet distance and in $O(n^2)$ for the Hausdorff distance\n(which both match the computation time for single polylines). Furthermore, we\npresent a greedy heuristic that allows to decompose polyline bundles into tree\nbundles in order to make our exact algorithm for trees useful on general\ninputs. The applicability of our approaches is demonstrated in an experimental\nevaluation on real-world data.",

On Ethereum, the most popular blockchain that\nsupports smart contracts, developers can choose among three\ntransaction-reverting statements (i.e., require, if...revert, and if...throw)\nto handle anomalous transactions. While these transaction-reverting statements\nare vital for preventing smart contracts from exhibiting abnormal behaviors or\nsuffering malicious attacks, there is limited understanding of how they are\nused in practice. In this work, we perform the first empirical study to\ncharacterize transaction-reverting statements in Ethereum smart contracts.

    "abstract": "In this thesis, we introduce Greenformers, a collection of model efficiency\nmethods to improve the model efficiency of the recently renowned transformer\nmodels with a low-rank approximation approach. The development trend of deep\nlearning models tends to results in a more complex and larger model. Although\nit leads to a better and more accurate prediction, the resulting model becomes\neven more costly, as it requires weeks of training with a huge amount of GPU\nresources. Particularly, the size and computational cost of transformer-based\nmodels have increased tremendously since its first debut in 2017 from ~100\nmillion parameters up to ~1.6 trillion parameters in early 2021. This\ncomputationally hungry model also incurs a substantial cost to the environment\nand even reaches an alarming level of carbon footprint. Some of these models\nare so massive that it is even impossible to run the model without a GPU\ncluster.\nGreenformers improve the model efficiency of transformer models by applying\nlow-rank approximation approaches. Specifically, we propose a low-rank\nfactorization approach to improve the efficiency of the transformer model\ncalled Low-Rank Transformer. We further compare our model with an existing\nlow-rank factorization approach called Linformer. Based on our analysis, the\nLow-Rank Transformer model is suitable for improving both the time and memory\nefficiency in processing short-sequence (<= 512) input data, while the\nLinformer model is suitable for improving the efficiency in processing\nlong-sequence input data (>= 512). We also show that Low-Rank Transformer is\nmore suitable for on-device deployment, as it significantly reduces the model\nsize. Additionally, we estimate that applying LRT to the existing BERT-base\nmodel can significantly reduce the computational, economical, and environmental\ncosts for developing such models by more than 30% of its original costs.",

    "abstract": "Classification and regression are two pillars of object detectors. In most\nCNN-based detectors, these two pillars are optimized independently. Without\ndirect interactions between them, the classification loss and the regression\nloss can not be optimized synchronously toward the optimal direction in the\ntraining phase. This clearly leads to lots of inconsistent predictions with\nhigh classification score but low localization accuracy or low classification\nscore but high localization accuracy in the inference phase, especially for the\nobjects of irregular shape and occlusion, which severely hurts the detection\nperformance of existing detectors after NMS. To reconcile prediction\nconsistency for balanced object detection, we propose a Harmonic loss to\nharmonize the optimization of classification branch and localization branch.\nThe Harmonic loss enables these two branches to supervise and promote each\nother during training, thereby producing consistent predictions with high\nco-occurrence of top classification and localization in the inference phase.\nFurthermore, in order to prevent the localization loss from being dominated by\noutliers during training phase, a Harmonic IoU loss is proposed to harmonize\nthe weight of the localization loss of different IoU-level samples.\nComprehensive experiments on benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate the\ngenerality and effectiveness of our model for facilitating existing object\ndetectors to state-of-the-art accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory diseases, including asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, and upper\nrespiratory tract infection (RTI), are among the most common diseases in\nclinics. The similarities among the symptoms of these diseases precludes prompt\ndiagnosis upon the patients' arrival. In pediatrics, the patients' limited\nability in expressing their situation makes precise diagnosis even harder. This\nbecomes worse in primary hospitals, where the lack of medical imaging devices\nand the doctors' limited experience further increase the difficulty of\ndistinguishing among similar diseases. In this paper, a pediatric fine-grained\ndiagnosis-assistant system is proposed to provide prompt and precise diagnosis\nusing solely clinical notes upon admission, which would assist clinicians\nwithout changing the diagnostic process. The proposed system consists of two\nstages: a test result structuralization stage and a disease identification\nstage. The first stage structuralizes test results by extracting relevant\nnumerical values from clinical notes, and the disease identification stage\nprovides a diagnosis based on text-form clinical notes and the structured data\nobtained from the first stage. A novel deep learning algorithm was developed\nfor the disease identification stage, where techniques including adaptive\nfeature infusion and multi-modal attentive fusion were introduced to fuse\nstructured and text data together. Clinical notes from over 12000 patients with\nrespiratory diseases were used to train a deep learning model, and clinical\nnotes from a non-overlapping set of about 1800 patients were used to evaluate\nthe performance of the trained model. The average precisions (AP) for\npneumonia, RTI, bronchitis and asthma are 0.878, 0.857, 0.714, and 0.825,\nrespectively, achieving a mean AP (mAP) of 0.819.",

These\nrobots move on a tabletop and change their height and orientation to haptically\nrender various surfaces and objects on-demand. Compared to previous\nencountered-type haptic approaches like shape displays or robotic arms, our\nproposed approach has an advantage in deployability, scalability, and\ngeneralizability -- these robots can be easily deployed due to their compact\nform factor. They can support multiple concurrent touch points in a large area\nthanks to the distributed nature of the robots. We propose and evaluate a novel\nset of interactions enabled by these robots which include: 1) rendering haptics\nfor VR objects by providing just-in-time touch-points on the user's hand, 2)\nsimulating continuous surfaces with the concurrent height and position change,\nand 3) enabling the user to pick up and move VR objects through graspable proxy\nobjects. Finally, we demonstrate HapticBots with various applications,\nincluding remote collaboration, education and training, design and 3D modeling,\nand gaming and entertainment.",

    "abstract": "It is very challenging for various visual tasks such as image fusion,\npedestrian detection and image-to-image translation in low light conditions due\nto the loss of effective target areas. In this case, infrared and visible\nimages can be used together to provide both rich detail information and\neffective target areas. In this paper, we present LLVIP, a visible-infrared\npaired dataset for low-light vision. This dataset contains 33672 images, or\n16836 pairs, most of which were taken at very dark scenes, and all of the\nimages are strictly aligned in time and space.

We compare the dataset with other visible-infrared datasets and\nevaluate the performance of some popular visual algorithms including image\nfusion, pedestrian detection and image-to-image translation on the dataset. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the complementary effect of fusion on image\ninformation, and find the deficiency of existing algorithms of the three visual\ntasks in very low-light conditions.

    "title": "A Techno-Economic Cost Framework for Satellite Networks Applied to Low  Earth Orbit Constellations: Assessing Starlink, OneWeb and Kuiper",
    "abstract": "Delivering broadband connectivity to unconnected areas is extremely\nchallenging. The emergence of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems has been\nseen as a potential solution for connecting remote areas. Despite the hype\naround these new technologies, we still lack an open-source modeling framework\nfor assessing the techno-economics of satellite broadband connectivity which is\ntherefore the purpose of this paper. Firstly, a generalizable techno-economic\nmodel is presented to assess the engineering-economics of satellite\nconstellations. Secondly, the approach is applied to assess the three main\ncompeting LEO constellations which include Starlink, OneWeb and Kuiper. This\ninvolves simulating the impact on coverage, capacity and cost as both the\nnumber of satellites and quantity of subscribers increases. Finally, a global\nassessment is undertaken visualizing the potential capacity and cost per user\nvia different subscriber scenarios. The results demonstrate how limited the\ncapacity will be once resources are spread across users in each satellite\ncoverage area. For example, if there is 1 user per 10 km^2 we estimate a mean\nper user capacity of 24.94 Mbps, 1.01 Mbps and 10.30 Mbps for Starlink, OneWeb\nand Kuiper respectively in the busiest hour of the day. But if the subscriber\ndensity increases to 1 user per km^2, then the mean per user capacity drops\nsignificantly to 2.49 Mbps, 0.10 Mbps and 1.02 Mbps for Starlink, OneWeb and\nKuiper respectively. LEO broadband will be an essential part of the\nconnectivity toolkit, but the results reveal that these mega-constellations\nwill most likely have to operate below 0.1 users per km^2 to provide a service\nthat outcompetes other broadband connectivity options. The open-source codebase\nwhich the paper contributes is provided with the hope that other engineers will\naccess, use, and further develop the satellite assessment capability.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning-based methods have shown promising results in\ncomputer vision area. However, a common deep learning model requires a large\namount of labeled data, which is labor-intensive to collect and label. What's\nmore, the model can be ruined due to the domain shift between training data and\ntesting data. Text recognition is a broadly studied field in computer vision\nand suffers from the same problems noted above due to the diversity of fonts\nand complicated backgrounds. In this paper, we focus on the text recognition\nproblem and mainly make three contributions toward these problems. First, we\ncollect a multi-source domain adaptation dataset for text recognition,\nincluding five different domains with over five million images, which is the\nfirst multi-domain text recognition dataset to our best knowledge. Secondly, we\npropose a new method called Meta Self-Learning, which combines the\nself-learning method with the meta-learning paradigm and achieves a better\nrecognition result under the scene of multi-domain adaptation. Thirdly,\nextensive experiments are conducted on the dataset to provide a benchmark and\nalso show the effectiveness of our method.

In particular, we provide a\ncounterexample to the claim that the described encoding is faithful.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods can dramatically improve\ngeneralization on unlabeled target domains. However, optimal hyper-parameter\nselection is critical to achieving high accuracy and avoiding negative\ntransfer. Supervised hyper-parameter validation is not possible without labeled\ntarget data, which raises the question: How can we validate unsupervised\nadaptation techniques in a realistic way? We first empirically analyze existing\ncriteria and demonstrate that they are not very effective for tuning\nhyper-parameters. Intuitively, a well-trained source classifier should embed\ntarget samples of the same class nearby, forming dense neighborhoods in feature\nspace. Based on this assumption, we propose a novel unsupervised validation\ncriterion that measures the density of soft neighborhoods by computing the\nentropy of the similarity distribution between points. Our criterion is simpler\nthan competing validation methods, yet more effective; it can tune\nhyper-parameters and the number of training iterations in both image\nclassification and semantic segmentation models.

    "abstract": "In recent years, filterbank learning has become an increasingly popular\nstrategy for various audio-related machine learning tasks. This is partly due\nto its ability to discover task-specific audio characteristics which can be\nleveraged in downstream processing. It is also a natural extension of the\nnearly ubiquitous deep learning methods employed to tackle a diverse array of\naudio applications. In this work, several variations of a frontend filterbank\nlearning module are investigated for piano transcription, a challenging\nlow-level music information retrieval task. We build upon a standard piano\ntranscription model, modifying only the feature extraction stage. The\nfilterbank module is designed such that its complex filters are unconstrained\n1D convolutional kernels with long receptive fields. Additional variations\nemploy the Hilbert transform to render the filters intrinsically analytic and\napply variational dropout to promote filterbank sparsity. Transcription results\nare compared across all experiments, and we offer visualization and analysis of\nthe filterbanks.",

    "abstract": "When solving the American options with or without dividends, numerical\nmethods often obtain lower convergence rates if further treatment is not\nimplemented even using high-order schemes. In this article, we present a fast\nand explicit fourth-order compact scheme for solving the free boundary options.\nIn particular, the early exercise features with the asset option and option\nsensitivity are computed based on a coupled of nonlinear PDEs with fixed\nboundaries for which a high order analytical approximation is obtained.\nFurthermore, we implement a new treatment at the left boundary by introducing a\nthird-order Robin boundary condition. Rather than computing the optimal\nexercise boundary from the analytical approximation, we simply obtain it from\nthe asset option based on the linear relationship at the left boundary. As\nsuch, a high order convergence rate can be achieved. We validate by examples\nthat the improvement at the left boundary yields a fourth-order convergence\nrate without further implementation of mesh refinement, Rannacher\ntime-stepping, and/or smoothing of the initial condition. Furthermore, we\nextensively compare, the performance of our present method with several 5(4)\nRunge-Kutta pairs and observe that Dormand and Prince and Bogacki and Shampine\n5(4) pairs are faster and provide more accurate numerical solutions. Based on\nnumerical results and comparison with other existing methods, we can validate\nthat the present method is very fast and provides more accurate solutions with\nvery coarse grids.",

    "abstract": "There are essentially three kinds of approaches to Uncertainty Quantification\n(UQ): (A) robust optimization, (B) Bayesian, (C) decision theory. Although (A)\nis robust, it is unfavorable with respect to accuracy and data assimilation.\n(B) requires a prior, it is generally brittle and posterior estimations can be\nslow. Although (C) leads to the identification of an optimal prior, its\napproximation suffers from the curse of dimensionality and the notion of risk\nis one that is averaged with respect to the distribution of the data. We\nintroduce a 4th kind which is a hybrid between (A), (B), (C), and hypothesis\ntesting. It can be summarized as, after observing a sample $x$, (1) defining a\nlikelihood region through the relative likelihood and (2) playing a minmax game\nin that region to define optimal estimators and their risk. The resulting\nmethod has several desirable properties (a) an optimal prior is identified\nafter measuring the data, and the notion of risk is a posterior one, (b) the\ndetermination of the optimal estimate and its risk can be reduced to computing\nthe minimum enclosing ball of the image of the likelihood region under the\nquantity of interest map (which is fast and not subject to the curse of\ndimensionality). The method is characterized by a parameter in $ [0,1]$ acting\nas an assumed lower bound on the rarity of the observed data (the relative\nlikelihood). When that parameter is near $1$, the method produces a posterior\ndistribution concentrated around a maximum likelihood estimate with tight but\nlow confidence UQ estimates. When that parameter is near $0$, the method\nproduces a maximal risk posterior distribution with high confidence UQ\nestimates. In addition to navigating the accuracy-uncertainty tradeoff, the\nproposed method addresses the brittleness of Bayesian inference by navigating\nthe robustness-accuracy tradeoff associated with data assimilation.",

Unfortunately,\nsolution of PDEs is non-trivial and often involves significant computational\ntime. With recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning, the solution of PDEs using neural network has emerged as a\ndomain with huge potential. However, most of the developments in this field are\nbased on either fully connected neural networks (FNN) or convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN). While FNN is computationally inefficient as the number of\nnetwork parameters can be potentially huge, CNN necessitates regular grid and\nsimpler domain.

The proposed approach couples FNN, graph neural network, and\nrecently developed Neural ODE framework. The primary idea is to use graph\nneural network for modeling the spatial domain, and Neural ODE for modeling the\ntemporal domain. The attention mechanism identifies important inputs/features\nand assign more weightage to the same; this enhances the performance of the\nproposed framework. Neural ODE, on the other hand, results in constant memory\ncost and allows trading of numerical precision for speed. We also propose depth\nrefinement as an effective technique for training the proposed architecture in\nlesser time with better accuracy.

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the regulation control of a one-dimensional\nreaction-diffusion equation in the presence of a state-delay in the reaction\nterm. The objective is to achieve the PI regulation of the right Dirichlet\ntrace with a command selected as the left Dirichlet trace. The control design\nstrategy consists of the design of a PI controller on a finite dimensional\ntruncated model obtained by spectral reduction. By an adequate selection of the\nnumber of modes of the original infinite-dimensional system, we show that the\nproposed control design procedure achieves both the exponential stabilization\nof the original infinite-dimensional system as well as the setpoint regulation\nof the right Dirichlet trace.",

    "abstract": "Music transcription is the process of transcribing music audio into music\nnotation. It is a field in which the machines still cannot beat human\nperformance. The main motivation for automatic music transcription is to make\nit possible for anyone playing a musical instrument, to be able to generate the\nmusic notes for a piece of music quickly and accurately. It does not matter if\nthe person is a beginner and simply struggles to find the music score by\nsearching, or an expert who heard a live jazz improvisation and would like to\nreproduce it without losing time doing manual transcription. We propose\nScorpiano -- a system that can automatically generate a music score for simple\nmonophonic piano melody tracks using digital signal processing. The system\nintegrates multiple digital audio processing methods: notes onset detection,\ntempo estimation, beat detection, pitch detection and finally generation of the\nmusic score. The system has proven to give good results for simple piano\nmelodies, comparable to commercially available neural network based systems.",

    "title": "Curricular SincNet: Towards Robust Deep Speaker Recognition by  Emphasizing Hard Samples in Latent Space",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models have become an increasingly preferred option for\nbiometric recognition systems, such as speaker recognition. SincNet, a deep\nneural network architecture, gained popularity in speaker recognition tasks due\nto its parameterized sinc functions that allow it to work directly on the\nspeech signal. The original SincNet architecture uses the softmax loss, which\nmay not be the most suitable choice for recognition-based tasks. Such loss\nfunctions do not impose inter-class margins nor differentiate between easy and\nhard training samples. Curriculum learning, particularly those leveraging\nangular margin-based losses, has proven very successful in other biometric\napplications such as face recognition. The advantage of such a curriculum\nlearning-based techniques is that it will impose inter-class margins as well as\ntaking to account easy and hard samples. In this paper, we propose Curricular\nSincNet (CL-SincNet), an improved SincNet model where we use a curricular loss\nfunction to train the SincNet architecture. The proposed model is evaluated on\nmultiple datasets using intra-dataset and inter-dataset evaluation protocols.\nIn both settings, the model performs competitively with other previously\npublished work. In the case of inter-dataset testing, it achieves the best\noverall results with a reduction of 4\\% error rate compare to SincNet and other\npublished work.",

    "abstract": "Gravitational waves from the coalescence of compact-binary sources are now\nroutinely observed by Earth bound detectors. The most sensitive search\nalgorithms convolve many different pre-calculated gravitational waveforms with\nthe detector data and look for coincident matches between different detectors.\nMachine learning is being explored as an alternative approach to building a\nsearch algorithm that has the prospect to reduce computational costs and target\nmore complex signals. In this work we construct a two-detector search for\ngravitational waves from binary black hole mergers using neural networks\ntrained on non-spinning binary black hole data from a single detector. The\nnetwork is applied to the data from both observatories independently and we\ncheck for events coincident in time between the two. This enables the efficient\nanalysis of large quantities of background data by time-shifting the\nindependent detector data. We find that while for a single detector the network\nretains $91.5\\%$ of the sensitivity matched filtering can achieve, this number\ndrops to $83.9\\%$ for two observatories. To enable the network to check for\nsignal consistency in the detectors, we then construct a set of simple networks\nthat operate directly on data from both detectors. We find that none of these\nsimple two-detector networks are capable of improving the sensitivity over\napplying networks individually to the data from the detectors and searching for\ntime coincidences.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural network transducers (RNN-T) are a promising end-to-end\nspeech recognition framework that transduces input acoustic frames into a\ncharacter sequence. The state-of-the-art encoder network for RNN-T is the\nConformer, which can effectively model the local-global context information via\nits convolution and self-attention layers. Although Conformer RNN-T has shown\noutstanding performance (measured by word error rate (WER) in general), most\nstudies have been verified in the setting where the train and test data are\ndrawn from the same domain. The domain mismatch problem for Conformer RNN-T has\nnot been intensively investigated yet, which is an important issue for the\nproduct-level speech recognition system. In this study, we identified that\nfully connected self-attention layers in the Conformer caused high deletion\nerrors, specifically in the long-form out-domain utterances. To address this\nproblem, we introduce sparse self-attention layers for Conformer-based encoder\nnetworks, which can exploit local and generalized global information by pruning\nmost of the in-domain fitted global connections. Further, we propose a state\nreset method for the generalization of the prediction network to cope with\nlong-form utterances. Applying proposed methods to an out-domain test, we\nobtained 24.6\\% and 6.5\\% relative character error rate (CER) reduction\ncompared to the fully connected and local self-attention layer-based\nConformers, respectively.",

    "abstract": "LDCT has drawn major attention in the medical imaging field due to the\npotential health risks of CT-associated X-ray radiation to patients. Reducing\nthe radiation dose, however, decreases the quality of the reconstructed images,\nwhich consequently compromises the diagnostic performance. Various deep\nlearning techniques have been introduced to improve the image quality of LDCT\nimages through denoising. GANs-based denoising methods usually leverage an\nadditional classification network, i.e. discriminator, to learn the most\ndiscriminate difference between the denoised and normal-dose images and, hence,\nregularize the denoising model accordingly; it often focuses either on the\nglobal structure or local details. To better regularize the LDCT denoising\nmodel, this paper proposes a novel method, termed DU-GAN, which leverages U-Net\nbased discriminators in the GANs framework to learn both global and local\ndifference between the denoised and normal-dose images in both image and\ngradient domains. The merit of such a U-Net based discriminator is that it can\nnot only provide the per-pixel feedback to the denoising network through the\noutputs of the U-Net but also focus on the global structure in a semantic level\nthrough the middle layer of the U-Net. In addition to the adversarial training\nin the image domain, we also apply another U-Net based discriminator in the\nimage gradient domain to alleviate the artifacts caused by photon starvation\nand enhance the edge of the denoised CT images. Furthermore, the CutMix\ntechnique enables the per-pixel outputs of the U-Net based discriminator to\nprovide radiologists with a confidence map to visualize the uncertainty of the\ndenoised results, facilitating the LDCT-based screening and diagnosis.\nExtensive experiments on the simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate\nsuperior performance over recently published methods both qualitatively and\nquantitatively.",
