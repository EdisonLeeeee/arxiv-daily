    "abstract": "Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is a remarkable\ntechnology to support data and energy transfer in the era of Internet of Things\n(IoT). In this paper, we propose a beam-compression resonant beam (BCRB) system\nfor long-range optical wireless information and power transfer based on the\ntelescope-like internal modulator (TIM). Utilizing the TIM, the resonant beam\nis compressed, making the transmission energy be further concentrated. Thus the\nover-the-air power loss produced by the beam diverged decreases, which enables\nthe long-range SWIPT capability. We establish the analytical models of the\ntransmission loss, the stability condition, the output power, and the spectral\nefficiency of the BCRB system, and evaluate the performance on the\nbeam-compression, energy delivery, and data transfer. Numerical analysis\nillustrates that the exemplary BCRB system can deliver 6 W power and have 14\nbit/s/Hz spectral efficiency over 200 m distance. Overall, the BCRB system is a\npotential scheme for long-range SWIPT in IoT.",

    "abstract": "Several studies analyzed existing Web APIs against the constraints of REST to\nestimate the degree of REST compliance among state-of-the-art APIs. These\nstudies revealed that only a small number of Web APIs are truly RESTful.\nMoreover, identified mismatches between theoretical REST concepts and practical\nimplementations lead us to believe that practitioners perceive many rules and\nbest practices aligned with these REST concepts differently in terms of their\nimportance and impact on software quality. We therefore conducted a Delphi\nstudy in which we confronted eight Web API experts from industry with a catalog\nof 82 REST API design rules. For each rule, we let them rate its importance and\nsoftware quality impact. As consensus, our experts rated 28 rules with high, 17\nwith medium, and 37 with low importance. Moreover, they perceived usability,\nmaintainability, and compatibility as the most impacted quality attributes. The\ndetailed analysis revealed that the experts saw rules for reaching Richardson\nmaturity level 2 as critical, while reaching level 3 was less important. As the\nacquired consensus data may serve as valuable input for designing a\ntool-supported approach for the automatic quality evaluation of RESTful APIs,\nwe briefly discuss requirements for such an approach and comment on the\napplicability of the most important rules.",

In our approach, we extend the physics-informed conditional\nKarhunen-Lo\\'{e}ve expansion (PICKLE) method for modeling subsurface flow with\nunknown flux (Neumann) and varying head (Dirichlet) boundary conditions. We\ndemonstrate that the PICKLE method is comparable in accuracy with the standard\nmaximum a posteriori (MAP) method, but is significantly faster than MAP for\nlarge-scale problems. Both methods use a mesh to discretize the computational\ndomain. In MAP, the parameters and states are discretized on the mesh;\ntherefore, the size of the MAP parameter estimation problem directly depends on\nthe mesh size. In PICKLE, the mesh is used to evaluate the residuals of the\ngoverning equation, while the parameters and states are approximated by the\ntruncated conditional Karhunen-Lo\\'{e}ve expansions with the number of\nparameters controlled by the smoothness of the parameter and state fields, and\nnot by the mesh size. For a considered example, we demonstrate that the\ncomputational cost of PICKLE increases near linearly (as $N_{FV}^{1.15}$) with\nthe number of grid points $N_{FV}$, while that of MAP increases much faster as\n$N_{FV}^{3.28}$. We demonstrated that once trained for one set of Dirichlet\nboundary conditions (i.e., one river stage), the PICKLE method provides\naccurate estimates of the hydraulic head for any value of the Dirichlet\nboundary conditions (i.e., for any river stage).",

However, the learned representations are often\ncontextually biased to the spurious scene correlations of different objects or\nobject and background, which may harm their generalization on the downstream\ntasks. To tackle the issue, we develop a novel object-aware contrastive\nlearning framework that first (a) localizes objects in a self-supervised manner\nand then (b) debias scene correlations via appropriate data augmentations\nconsidering the inferred object locations. For (a), we propose the contrastive\nclass activation map (ContraCAM), which finds the most discriminative regions\n(e.g., objects) in the image compared to the other images using the\ncontrastively trained models. We further improve the ContraCAM to detect\nmultiple objects and entire shapes via an iterative refinement procedure. For\n(b), we introduce two data augmentations based on ContraCAM, object-aware\nrandom crop and background mixup, which reduce contextual and background biases\nduring contrastive self-supervised learning, respectively.

Furthermore, statistical measures which are appropriate in these\nscenarios are discussed and implemented on a real-life dataset (car insurance\nclaims). In the end, popular data-level methods such as random oversampling,\nrandom undersampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique, Tomek link,\nand others are implemented in Python, and their performance is compared.",

    "abstract": "We consider a sequential blocked matching (SBM) model where strategic agents\nrepeatedly report ordinal preferences over a set of services to a central\nmechanism. The central mechanism's goal is to elicit agents' true preferences\nand design a policy that matches services to agents in order to maximize the\nexpected social welfare with the added constraint that each matched service can\nbe \\emph{blocked} or unavailable for a number of time periods. Naturally, SBM\nmodels the repeated allocation of reusable services to a set of agents where\neach allocated service becomes unavailable for a fixed duration. We first\nconsider the offline SBM setting, where the the strategic agents are aware of\nthe true preferences. We measure the performance of any policy by\n\\emph{distortion}, the worst-case multiplicative approximation guaranteed by\nany policy. For the setting with $S$ services, we establish lower bounds of\n$\\Omega(S)$ and $\\Omega(\\sqrt{S})$ on the distortions of any deterministic and\nrandomised mechanisms, respectively. We complement these results by providing\napproximately truthful, measured by \\emph{incentive ratio}, deterministic and\nrandomised policies based on the repeated application of random serial\ndictatorship that match the lower bounds. Our results show that there is a\nsignificant improvement if one considers the class of randomised policies.\nFinally, we consider the online SBM setting with bandit feedback where each\nagent is unaware of her true preference, and the center must facilitate each\nagent in the learning of agent's preference through the matching of services\nover time. We design an approximately truthful mechanism based on the\nExplore-then-Commit paradigm, which achieves logarithmic dynamic approximate\nregret.",

We propose the majorization minimization (MM) method for distributed\nPGO ($\\mathsf{MM\\!\\!-\\!\\!PGO}$) that applies to a broad class of robust loss\nkernels. The $\\mathsf{MM\\!\\!-\\!\\!PGO}$ method is guaranteed to converge to\nfirst-order critical points under mild conditions. Furthermore, noting that the\n$\\mathsf{MM\\!\\!-\\!\\!PGO}$ method is reminiscent of proximal methods, we\nleverage Nesterov's method and adopt adaptive restarts to accelerate\nconvergence. The resulting accelerated MM methods for distributed PGO -- both\nwith a master node in the network ($\\mathsf{AMM\\!\\!-\\!\\!PGO}^*$) and without\n($\\mathsf{AMM\\!\\!-\\!\\!PGO}^{\\#}$) -- have faster convergence in contrast to the\n$\\mathsf{MM\\!\\!-\\!\\!PGO}$ method without sacrificing theoretical guarantees.

The efficacy of this work is validated\nthrough extensive applications to 2D and 3D SLAM benchmark datasets and\ncomprehensive comparisons against existing state-of-the-art methods, indicating\nthat our MM methods converge faster and result in better solutions to\ndistributed PGO.",

    "title": "Extracting Grammars from a Neural Network Parser for Anomaly Detection  in Unknown Formats",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise as a technique for training\nan artificial neural network to parse sentences in some unknown format. A key\naspect of this approach is that rather than explicitly inferring a grammar that\ndescribes the format, the neural network learns to perform various parsing\nactions (such as merging two tokens) over a corpus of sentences, with the goal\nof maximizing the total reward, which is roughly based on the estimated\nfrequency of the resulting parse structures. This can allow the learning\nprocess to more easily explore different action choices, since a given choice\nmay change the optimality of the parse (as expressed by the total reward), but\nwill not result in the failure to parse a sentence. However, the approach also\nexhibits limitations: first, the neural network does not provide production\nrules for the grammar that it uses during parsing; second, because this neural\nnetwork can successfully parse any sentence, it cannot be directly used to\nidentify sentences that deviate from the format of the training sentences,\ni.e., that are anomalous. In this paper, we address these limitations by\npresenting procedures for extracting production rules from the neural network,\nand for using these rules to determine whether a given sentence is nominal or\nanomalous, when compared to structures observed within training data. In the\nlatter case, an attempt is made to identify the location of the anomaly.\nAdditionally, a two pass mechanism is presented for dealing with formats\ncontaining high-entropy information. We empirically evaluate the approach on\nartificial formats, demonstrating effectiveness, but also identifying\nlimitations. By further improving parser learning, and leveraging rule\nextraction and anomaly detection, one might begin to understand common errors,\neither benign or malicious, in practical formats.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based language models pre-trained on large amounts of text data\nhave proven remarkably successful in learning generic transferable linguistic\nrepresentations. Here we study whether structural guidance leads to more\nhuman-like systematic linguistic generalization in Transformer language models\nwithout resorting to pre-training on very large amounts of data. We explore two\ngeneral ideas. The \"Generative Parsing\" idea jointly models the incremental\nparse and word sequence as part of the same sequence modeling task. The\n\"Structural Scaffold\" idea guides the language model's representation via\nadditional structure loss that separately predicts the incremental constituency\nparse. We train the proposed models along with a vanilla Transformer language\nmodel baseline on a 14 million-token and a 46 million-token subset of the BLLIP\ndataset, and evaluate models' syntactic generalization performances on SG Test\nSuites and sized BLiMP.

Unfortunately, the\nstate-of-the-art vision-based tracking algorithms fail in surgical images due\nto the challenges imposed by the nature of such environments. In this paper, we\nproposed a novel and unified deep learning-based approach that can learn how to\ntrack features reliably as well as learn how to detect such reliable features\nfor tracking purposes. The proposed network dubbed as Deep-PT, consists of a\ntracker network which is a convolutional neural network simulating\ncross-correlation in terms of deep learning and two fully connected networks\nthat operate on the output of intermediate layers of the tracker to detect\nfeatures and predict trackability of the detected points. The ability to detect\nfeatures based on the capabilities of the tracker distinguishes the proposed\nmethod from previous algorithms used in this area and improves the robustness\nof the algorithms against dynamics of the scene. The network is trained using\nmultiple datasets due to the lack of specialized dataset for feature tracking\ndatasets and extensive comparisons are conducted to compare the accuracy of\nDeep-PT against recent pixel tracking algorithms. As the experiments suggest,\nthe proposed deep architecture deliberately learns what to track and how to\ntrack and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

However, deep neural\nnetworks are often under- or over-confident in their predictions. Consequently,\nmethods have been developed to improve the calibration of their predictive\nuncertainty both during training and post-hoc. In this work, we propose\ndifferentiable losses to improve calibration based on a soft (continuous)\nversion of the binning operation underlying popular calibration-error\nestimators. When incorporated into training, these soft calibration losses\nachieve state-of-the-art single-model ECE across multiple datasets with less\nthan 1% decrease in accuracy. For instance, we observe an 82% reduction in ECE\n(70% relative to the post-hoc rescaled ECE) in exchange for a 0.7% relative\ndecrease in accuracy relative to the cross entropy baseline on CIFAR-100. When\nincorporated post-training, the soft-binning-based calibration error objective\nimproves upon temperature scaling, a popular recalibration method. Overall,\nexperiments across losses and datasets demonstrate that using\ncalibration-sensitive procedures yield better uncertainty estimates under\ndataset shift than the standard practice of using a cross entropy loss and\npost-hoc recalibration methods.",

However, since the emergence of the ImageNet dataset and the AlexNet\nmodel in 2012, the size of new open-source labeled vision datasets has remained\nroughly constant. Consequently, only a minority of publications in the computer\nvision community tackle supervised learning on datasets that are orders of\nmagnitude larger than Imagenet. In this paper, we survey computer vision\nresearch domains that study the effects of such large datasets on model\nperformance across different vision tasks. We summarize the community's current\nunderstanding of those effects, and highlight some open questions related to\ntraining with massive datasets. In particular, we tackle: (a) The largest\ndatasets currently used in computer vision research and the interesting\ntakeaways from training on such datasets; (b) The effectiveness of pre-training\non large datasets; (c) Recent advancements and hurdles facing synthetic\ndatasets; (d) An overview of double descent and sample non-monotonicity\nphenomena; and finally, (e) A brief discussion of lifelong/continual learning\nand how it fares compared to learning from huge labeled datasets in an offline\nsetting.

Manifold\nmodels are closely related to semi-local similarity, a well-known property of\nnatural images, referring to that for most natural-image patches, several\nsimilar patches can be found in its spatial neighborhood. Many approaches to\nsingle image interpolation use manifold models to exploit semi-local similarity\nby two mutually exclusive parts: i) searching each target patch's similar\npatches and ii) operating on the searched similar patches, the target patch and\nthe measured input pixels to estimate the target patch. Unfortunately, aliasing\nin the input image makes it challenging for both parts. A very few works\nexplicitly deal with those challenges and only ad-hoc solutions are proposed.\nTo overcome the challenge in the first part, we propose a carefully-designed\nadaptive technique to remove aliasing in severely aliased regions, which cannot\nbe removed from traditional techniques. This technique enables reliable\nidentification of similar patches even in the presence of strong aliasing. To\novercome the challenge in the second part, we propose to use the\naliasing-removed image to guide the initialization of the interpolated image\nand develop a progressive scheme to refine the interpolated image based on\nmanifold models.

    "abstract": "Top-$k$ multi-label learning, which returns the top-$k$ predicted labels from\nan input, has many practical applications such as image annotation, document\nanalysis, and web search engine. However, the vulnerabilities of such\nalgorithms with regards to dedicated adversarial perturbation attacks have not\nbeen extensively studied previously. In this work, we develop methods to create\nadversarial perturbations that can be used to attack top-$k$ multi-label\nlearning-based image annotation systems (TkML-AP).

    "abstract": "Database algorithms play a crucial part in systems biology studies by\nidentifying proteins from mass spectrometry data. Many of these database search\nalgorithms incur huge computational costs by computing similarity scores for\neach pair of sparse experimental spectrum and candidate theoretical spectrum\nvectors. Modern MS instrumentation techniques which are capable of generating\nhigh-resolution spectrometry data require comparison against an enormous search\nspace, further emphasizing the need of efficient accelerators. Recent research\nhas shown that the overall cost of scoring, and deducing peptides is dominated\nby the communication costs between different hierarchies of memory and\nprocessing units. However, these communication costs are seldom considered in\naccelerator-based architectures leading to inefficient DRAM accesses, and poor\ndata-utilization due to irregular memory access patterns. In this paper, we\npropose a novel communication-avoiding micro-architecture to compute\ncross-correlation based similarity score by utilizing efficient local cache,\nand peptide pre-fetching to minimize DRAM accesses, and a custom-designed\npeptide broadcast bus to allow input reuse. An efficient bus arbitration scheme\nwas designed, and implemented to minimize synchronization cost and exploit\nparallelism of processing elements. Our simulation results show that the\nproposed micro-architecture performs on average 24x better than a CPU\nimplementation running on a 3.6 GHz Intel i7-4970 processor with 16GB memory.",

Although exploration is indispensable for long success of a\nrecommender system, the exploration has been considered as the risk to decrease\nuser satisfaction. The reason for the risk is that items chosen for exploration\nfrequently mismatch with the user's interests. To mitigate this risk,\nrecommender systems have mixed items chosen for exploration into a\nrecommendation list, disguising the items as recommendations to elicit feedback\non the items to discover the user's additional tastes. This mix-in approach has\nbeen widely used in many recommenders, but there is rare research, evaluating\nthe effectiveness of the mix-in approach or proposing a new approach for\neliciting user feedback without deceiving users. In this work, we aim to\npropose a new approach for feedback elicitation without any deception and\ncompare our approach to the conventional mix-in approach for evaluation.

As a general trend, the\nbehavior of a classic synchronous generator is to be emulated for a class of\nconventional grid components like, e.g., renewable generators or/and power\nelectronic units. Most of the times production of these units is of interest,\nas it is the case for the new AGC scheme of Spain which, from this point of\nview, looks like a VPP. However, dynamic aspects are of high importance,\nespecially for increasing the actual rate of penetration of Renewable Energy\nSources (RES). Indeed, to go above the actual rate of RES penetration, one\nshould deal with full participation of RES to grid services. For that, we\npropose here a new concept called Dynamic VPP (DVPP) which fully integrates the\ndynamic aspects at all levels: locally (for each RES generator), globally (for\ngrid ancillary services and interaction with other neighbor elements of the\ngrid) and economically (for internal optimal dispatch and participation to\nelectricity markets). A DVPP is a set of RES along with a set of control and\noperation procedures. This means methodologies for: choosing the participating\nRES, optimal and continuous operation as a whole (especially in case of loss of\nnatural resources - e.g., wind, sun - on a part of the DVPP), regulation (in\nthe dynamic sense) to ensure local objectives for each generator, participation\nto ancillary services of the DVPP as a unit and to diminish negative effects of\ninteraction with neighbor dynamics elements of the power system, integration in\nboth actual power systems scenarios (with mixed classic and power electronics\nbased generation) and future ones with high degree of RES penetration.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have made much progress in dealing with visual tasks. However,\nexisting vision transformers still do not possess an ability that is important\nto visual input: building the attention among features of different scales. The\nreasons for this problem are two-fold: (1) Input embeddings of each layer are\nequal-scale without cross-scale features; (2) Some vision transformers\nsacrifice the small-scale features of embeddings to lower the cost of the\nself-attention module. To make up this defect, we propose Cross-scale Embedding\nLayer (CEL) and Long Short Distance Attention (LSDA). In particular, CEL blends\neach embedding with multiple patches of different scales, providing the model\nwith cross-scale embeddings. LSDA splits the self-attention module into a\nshort-distance and long-distance one, also lowering the cost but keeping both\nsmall-scale and large-scale features in embeddings. Through these two designs,\nwe achieve cross-scale attention. Besides, we propose dynamic position bias for\nvision transformers to make the popular relative position bias apply to\nvariable-sized images. Based on these proposed modules, we construct our vision\narchitecture called CrossFormer. Experiments show that CrossFormer outperforms\nother transformers on several representative visual tasks, especially object\ndetection and segmentation.

    "abstract": "Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, the most common control\nstrategy in the industry, always suffers from health problems resulting from\nexternal disturbances, improper tuning, etc. Therefore, there have been many\nstudies on control performance assessment (CPA) and optimal tuning. Minimum\noutput variance (MOV) is used as a benchmark for CPA of PID, but it is\ndifficult to be found due to the associated non-convex optimization problem.\nFor the optimal tuning, many different objective functions have been proposed,\nbut few consider the stochastic disturbance rejection. In this paper, a\nmulti-objective function simultaneously considering integral of absolute error\n(IAE) and MOV is proposed to optimize PID for better disturbance rejection. The\nnon-convex problem and multi-objective problem are solved by\nteaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO). This stochastic optimization\nalgorithm can guarantee a tighter lower bound for MOV due to the excellent\ncapability of local optima avoidance and needs less calculation time due to the\nlow complexity. Furthermore, CPA and the tuning method are extended to the PI/P\ncascade case. The results of several numerical examples of CPA problems show\nthat TLBO can generate better MOV than existing methods within one second on\nmost examples. The simulation results of the tuning method applied to two\ntemperature control systems reveal that the weight of the multi-objective\nfunction can compromise other performance criteria such as overshoot and\nsettling time to improve the disturbance rejection. It also indicates that the\ntuning method can be utilized to multi-stage PID control strategy to resolve\nthe contradiction between disturbance rejection and other performance criteria.",

    "abstract": "The target representation learned by convolutional neural networks plays an\nimportant role in Thermal Infrared (TIR) tracking. Currently, most of the\ntop-performing TIR trackers are still employing representations learned by the\nmodel trained on the RGB data. However, this representation does not take into\naccount the information in the TIR modality itself, limiting the performance of\nTIR tracking. To solve this problem, we propose to distill representations of\nthe TIR modality from the RGB modality with Cross-Modal Distillation (CMD) on a\nlarge amount of unlabeled paired RGB-TIR data. We take advantage of the\ntwo-branch architecture of the baseline tracker, i.e. DiMP, for cross-modal\ndistillation working on two components of the tracker. Specifically, we use one\nbranch as a teacher module to distill the representation learned by the model\ninto the other branch. Benefiting from the powerful model in the RGB modality,\nthe cross-modal distillation can learn the TIR-specific representation for\npromoting TIR tracking. The proposed approach can be incorporated into\ndifferent baseline trackers conveniently as a generic and independent\ncomponent. Furthermore, the semantic coherence of paired RGB and TIR images is\nutilized as a supervised signal in the distillation loss for cross-modal\nknowledge transfer. In practice, three different approaches are explored to\ngenerate paired RGB-TIR patches with the same semantics for training in an\nunsupervised way. It is easy to extend to an even larger scale of unlabeled\ntraining data. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR dataset and PTB-TIR\ndataset demonstrate that our proposed cross-modal distillation method\neffectively learns TIR-specific target representations transferred from the RGB\nmodality. Our tracker outperforms the baseline tracker by achieving absolute\ngains of 2.3% Success, 2.7% Precision, and 2.5% Normalized Precision\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Learning with noisy labels is an important and challenging task for training\naccurate deep neural networks. Some commonly-used loss functions, such as Cross\nEntropy (CE), suffer from severe overfitting to noisy labels. Robust loss\nfunctions that satisfy the symmetric condition were tailored to remedy this\nproblem, which however encounter the underfitting effect. In this paper, we\ntheoretically prove that \\textbf{any loss can be made robust to noisy labels}\nby restricting the network output to the set of permutations over a fixed\nvector. When the fixed vector is one-hot, we only need to constrain the output\nto be one-hot, which however produces zero gradients almost everywhere and thus\nmakes gradient-based optimization difficult. In this work, we introduce the\nsparse regularization strategy to approximate the one-hot constraint, which is\ncomposed of network output sharpening operation that enforces the output\ndistribution of a network to be sharp and the $\\ell_p$-norm ($p\\le 1$)\nregularization that promotes the network output to be sparse. This simple\napproach guarantees the robustness of arbitrary loss functions while not\nhindering the fitting ability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\ncan significantly improve the performance of commonly-used loss functions in\nthe presence of noisy labels and class imbalance, and outperform the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "In subjective full-reference image quality assessment, differences between\nperceptual image qualities of the reference image and its distorted versions\nare evaluated, often using degradation category ratings (DCR). However, the DCR\nhas been criticized since differences between rating categories on this ordinal\nscale might not be perceptually equidistant, and observers may have different\nunderstandings of the categories. Pair comparisons (PC) of distorted images,\nfollowed by Thurstonian reconstruction of scale values, overcome these\nproblems. In addition, PC is more sensitive than DCR, and it can provide scale\nvalues in fractional, just noticeable difference (JND) units that express a\nprecise perceptional interpretation. Still, the comparison of images of nearly\nthe same quality can be difficult. We introduce boosting techniques embedded in\nmore general triplet comparisons (TC) that increase the sensitivity even more.\nBoosting amplifies the artefacts of distorted images, enlarges their visual\nrepresentation by zooming, increases the visibility of the distortions by a\nflickering effect, or combines some of the above. Experimental results show the\neffectiveness of boosted TC for seven types of distortion. We crowdsourced over\n1.7 million responses to triplet questions. A detailed analysis shows that\nboosting increases the discriminatory power and allows to reduce the number of\nsubjective ratings without sacrificing the accuracy of the resulting relative\nimage quality values. Our technique paves the way to fine-grained image quality\ndatasets, allowing for more distortion levels, yet with high-quality subjective\nannotations.

However, they\neither employ a single map from the last convolutional layer which degrades the\nlocalization accuracy in complex scenarios or separately use multiple maps for\ndecision making, introducing intractable computations for aerial mobile\nplatforms. Thus, in this work, we propose an efficient and effective\nhierarchical feature transformer (HiFT) for aerial tracking. Hierarchical\nsimilarity maps generated by multi-level convolutional layers are fed into the\nfeature transformer to achieve the interactive fusion of spatial (shallow\nlayers) and semantics cues (deep layers). Consequently, not only the global\ncontextual information can be raised, facilitating the target search, but also\nour end-to-end architecture with the transformer can efficiently learn the\ninterdependencies among multi-level features, thereby discovering a\ntracking-tailored feature space with strong discriminability.

    "abstract": "Datasets are rarely a realistic approximation of the target population. Say,\nprevalence is misrepresented, image quality is above clinical standards, etc.\nThis mismatch is known as sampling bias. Sampling biases are a major hindrance\nfor machine learning models. They cause significant gaps between model\nperformance in the lab and in the real world. Our work is a solution to\nprevalence bias. Prevalence bias is the discrepancy between the prevalence of a\npathology and its sampling rate in the training dataset, introduced upon\ncollecting data or due to the practioner rebalancing the training batches. This\npaper lays the theoretical and computational framework for training models, and\nfor prediction, in the presence of prevalence bias. Concretely a bias-corrected\nloss function, as well as bias-corrected predictive rules, are derived under\nthe principles of Bayesian risk minimization. The loss exhibits a direct\nconnection to the information gain. It offers a principled alternative to\nheuristic training losses and complements test-time procedures based on\nselecting an operating point from summary curves. It integrates seamlessly in\nthe current paradigm of (deep) learning using stochastic backpropagation and\nnaturally with Bayesian models.",

Recently, pseudo transient analysis\n(PTA) has shown to be one of the most promising continuation SPICE solver.\nHowever, the PTA efficiency is highly influenced by the inserted\npseudo-parameters.

    "abstract": "We present a generative adversarial network to synthesize 3D pose sequences\nof co-speech upper-body gestures with appropriate affective expressions. Our\nnetwork consists of two components: a generator to synthesize gestures from a\njoint embedding space of features encoded from the input speech and the seed\nposes, and a discriminator to distinguish between the synthesized pose\nsequences and real 3D pose sequences. We leverage the Mel-frequency cepstral\ncoefficients and the text transcript computed from the input speech in separate\nencoders in our generator to learn the desired sentiments and the associated\naffective cues. We design an affective encoder using multi-scale\nspatial-temporal graph convolutions to transform 3D pose sequences into latent,\npose-based affective features. We use our affective encoder in both our\ngenerator, where it learns affective features from the seed poses to guide the\ngesture synthesis, and our discriminator, where it enforces the synthesized\ngestures to contain the appropriate affective expressions. We perform extensive\nevaluations on two benchmark datasets for gesture synthesis from the speech,\nthe TED Gesture Dataset and the GENEA Challenge 2020 Dataset. Compared to the\nbest baselines, we improve the mean absolute joint error by 10--33%, the mean\nacceleration difference by 8--58%, and the Fr\\'echet Gesture Distance by\n21--34%.

    "abstract": "Traffic accident anticipation is a vital function of Automated Driving\nSystems (ADSs) for providing a safety-guaranteed driving experience. An\naccident anticipation model aims to predict accidents promptly and accurately\nbefore they occur. Existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models of accident\nanticipation lack a human-interpretable explanation of their decision-making.\nAlthough these models perform well, they remain a black-box to the ADS users,\nthus difficult to get their trust. To this end, this paper presents a Gated\nRecurrent Unit (GRU) network that learns spatio-temporal relational features\nfor the early anticipation of traffic accidents from dashcam video data. A\npost-hoc attention mechanism named Grad-CAM is integrated into the network to\ngenerate saliency maps as the visual explanation of the accident anticipation\ndecision. An eye tracker captures human eye fixation points for generating\nhuman attention maps. The explainability of network-generated saliency maps is\nevaluated in comparison to human attention maps. Qualitative and quantitative\nresults on a public crash dataset confirm that the proposed explainable network\ncan anticipate an accident on average 4.57 seconds before it occurs, with\n94.02% average precision. In further, various post-hoc attention-based XAI\nmethods are evaluated and compared. It confirms that the Grad-CAM chosen by\nthis study can generate high-quality, human-interpretable saliency maps (with\n1.42 Normalized Scanpath Saliency) for explaining the crash anticipation\ndecision. Importantly, results confirm that the proposed AI model, with a\nhuman-inspired design, can outperform humans in the accident anticipation.",

    "abstract": "3D ultrasound (US) is widely used for its rich diagnostic information.\nHowever, it is criticized for its limited field of view. 3D freehand US\nreconstruction is promising in addressing the problem by providing broad range\nand freeform scan. The existing deep learning based methods only focus on the\nbasic cases of skill sequences, and the model relies on the training data\nheavily. The sequences in real clinical practice are a mix of diverse skills\nand have complex scanning paths. Besides, deep models should adapt themselves\nto the testing cases with prior knowledge for better robustness, rather than\nonly fit to the training cases. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to\nsensorless freehand 3D US reconstruction considering the complex skill\nsequences. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we advance a novel online\nlearning framework by designing a differentiable reconstruction algorithm. It\nrealizes an end-to-end optimization from section sequences to the reconstructed\nvolume. Second, a self-supervised learning method is developed to explore the\ncontext information that reconstructed by the testing data itself, promoting\nthe perception of the model. Third, inspired by the effectiveness of shape\nprior, we also introduce adversarial training to strengthen the learning of\nanatomical shape prior in the reconstructed volume. By mining the context and\nstructural cues of the testing data, our online learning methods can drive the\nmodel to handle complex skill sequences. Experimental results on developmental\ndysplasia of the hip US and fetal US datasets show that, our proposed method\ncan outperform the start-of-the-art methods regarding the shift errors and path\nsimilarities.",

    "abstract": "Traditional imitation learning provides a set of methods and algorithms to\nlearn a reward function or policy from expert demonstrations. Learning from\ndemonstration has been shown to be advantageous for navigation tasks as it\nallows for machine learning non-experts to quickly provide information needed\nto learn complex traversal behaviors. However, a minimal set of demonstrations\nis unlikely to capture all relevant information needed to achieve the desired\nbehavior in every possible future operational environment. Due to\ndistributional shift among environments, a robot may encounter features that\nwere rarely or never observed during training for which the appropriate reward\nvalue is uncertain, leading to undesired outcomes. This paper proposes a\nBayesian technique which quantifies uncertainty over the weights of a linear\nreward function given a dataset of minimal human demonstrations to operate\nsafely in dynamic environments. This uncertainty is quantified and incorporated\ninto a risk averse set of weights used to generate cost maps for planning.\nExperiments in a 3-D environment with a simulated robot show that our proposed\nalgorithm enables a robot to avoid dangerous terrain completely in two out of\nthree test scenarios and accumulates a lower amount of risk than related\napproaches in all scenarios without requiring any additional demonstrations.",

We demonstrate the\neffectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of our grasp planner on a row of\nchallenging 3D objects and high-DOF grippers, such as Barrett Hand and Shadow\nHand, where our method achieves superior grasp qualities over competitors.",

    "title": "A Hybrid Ensemble Feature Selection Design for Candidate Biomarkers  Discovery from Transcriptome Profiles",
    "abstract": "The discovery of disease biomarkers from gene expression data has been\ngreatly advanced by feature selection (FS) methods, especially using ensemble\nFS (EFS) strategies with perturbation at the data level (i.e., homogeneous,\nHom-EFS) or method level (i.e., heterogeneous, Het-EFS). Here we proposed a\nHybrid EFS (Hyb-EFS) design that explores both types of perturbation to improve\nthe stability and the predictive power of candidate biomarkers. With this,\nHyb-EFS aims to disrupt associations of good performance with a single dataset,\nsingle algorithm, or a specific combination of both, which is particularly\ninteresting for better reproducibility of genomic biomarkers. We investigated\nthe adequacy of our approach for microarray data related to four types of\ncancer, carrying out an extensive comparison with other ensemble and single FS\napproaches. Five FS methods were used in our experiments: Wx, Symmetrical\nUncertainty (SU), Gain Ratio (GR), Characteristic Direction (GeoDE), and\nReliefF. We observed that the Hyb-EFS and Het-EFS approaches attenuated the\nlarge performance variation observed for most single FS and Hom-EFS across\ndistinct datasets. Also, the Hyb-EFS improved upon the stability of the Het-EFS\nwithin our domain. Comparing the Hyb-EFS and Het-EFS composed of the\ntop-performing selectors (Wx, GR, and SU), our hybrid approach surpassed the\nequivalent heterogeneous design and the best Hom-EFS (Hom-Wx). Interestingly,\nthe rankings produced by our Hyb-EFS reached greater biological plausibility,\nwith a notably high enrichment for cancer-related genes and pathways. Thus, our\nexperiments suggest the potential of the proposed Hybrid EFS design in\ndiscovering candidate biomarkers from microarray data. Finally, we provide an\nopen-source framework to support similar analyses in other domains, both as a\nuser-friendly application and a plain Python package.",

    "abstract": "In adversarial environments, one side could gain an advantage by identifying\nthe opponent's strategy. For example, in combat games, if an opponents strategy\nis identified as overly aggressive, one could lay a trap that exploits the\nopponent's aggressive nature. However, an opponent's strategy is not always\napparent and may need to be estimated from observations of their actions. This\npaper proposes to use inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to identify\nstrategies in adversarial environments. Specifically, the contributions of this\nwork are 1) the demonstration of this concept on gaming combat data generated\nfrom three pre-defined strategies and 2) the framework for using IRL to achieve\nstrategy identification.

    "abstract": "With the growing interest in the machine learning community to solve\nreal-world problems, it has become crucial to uncover the hidden reasoning\nbehind their decisions by focusing on the fairness and auditing the predictions\nmade by these black-box models. In this paper, we propose a novel method to\naddress two key issues: (a) Can we simultaneously learn fair disentangled\nrepresentations while ensuring the utility of the learned representation for\ndownstream tasks, and (b)Can we provide theoretical insights into when the\nproposed approach will be both fair and accurate. To address the former, we\npropose the method FRIED, Fair Representation learning using Interpolation\nEnabled Disentanglement. In our architecture, by imposing a critic-based\nadversarial framework, we enforce the interpolated points in the latent space\nto be more realistic. This helps in capturing the data manifold effectively and\nenhances the utility of the learned representation for downstream prediction\ntasks. We address the latter question by developing a theory on\nfairness-accuracy trade-offs using classifier-based conditional mutual\ninformation estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FRIED on datasets\nof different modalities - tabular, text, and image datasets. We observe that\nthe representations learned by FRIED are overall fairer in comparison to\nexisting baselines and also accurate for downstream prediction tasks.\nAdditionally, we evaluate FRIED on a real-world healthcare claims dataset where\nwe conduct an expert aided model auditing study providing useful insights into\nopioid ad-diction patterns.",

    "abstract": "Dealing with missing values and incomplete time series is a labor-intensive\nand time-consuming inevitable task when handling data coming from real-world\napplications. Effective spatio-temporal representations would allow imputation\nmethods to reconstruct missing temporal data by exploiting information coming\nfrom sensors at different locations. However, standard methods fall short in\ncapturing the nonlinear time and space dependencies existing within networks of\ninterconnected sensors and do not take full advantage of the available - and\noften strong - relational information. Notably, most of state-of-the-art\nimputation methods based on deep learning do not explicitly model relational\naspects and, in any case, do not exploit processing frameworks able to\nadequately represent structured spatio-temporal data. Conversely, graph neural\nnetworks have recently surged in popularity as both expressive and scalable\ntools for processing sequential data with relational inductive biases. In this\nwork, we present the first assessment of graph neural networks in the context\nof multivariate time series imputation. In particular, we introduce a novel\ngraph neural network architecture, named GRIL, which aims at reconstructing\nmissing data in the different channels of a multivariate time series by\nlearning spatial-temporal representations through message passing. Preliminary\nempirical results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nthe imputation task on relevant benchmarks with mean absolute error\nimprovements often higher than 20%.",

Specifically, we first\nshow that under some mild assumptions on the loss functions, there is an\nalgorithm whose output could achieve an upper bound of\n$\\tilde{O}((\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}+\\frac{\\sqrt{d\\log\n\\frac{1}{\\delta}}}{n\\epsilon})^\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta-1})$ for $(\\epsilon,\n\\delta)$-DP when $\\theta\\geq 2$, here $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the\ndimension of the space.

Next we show that\nthe excess population risk of population functions satisfying TNC with\nparameter $\\theta>1$ is always lower bounded by\n$\\Omega((\\frac{d}{n\\epsilon})^\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta-1}) $ and\n$\\Omega((\\frac{\\sqrt{d\\log\n\\frac{1}{\\delta}}}{n\\epsilon})^\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta-1})$ for $\\epsilon$-DP and\n$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP, respectively.

Our result\naccurately predicts the statistical characteristics of data traffic and verify\nagainst the ground truth observations.

    "title": "Towards Adversarially Robust and Domain Generalizable Stereo Matching by  Rethinking DNN Feature Backbones",
    "abstract": "Stereo matching has recently witnessed remarkable progress using Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNNs). But, how robust are they? Although it has been well-known that\nDNNs often suffer from adversarial vulnerability with a catastrophic drop in\nperformance, the situation is even worse in stereo matching. This paper first\nshows that a type of weak white-box attacks can fail state-of-the-art methods.\nThe attack is learned by a proposed stereo-constrained projected gradient\ndescent (PGD) method in stereo matching. This observation raises serious\nconcerns for the deployment of DNN-based stereo matching. Parallel to the\nadversarial vulnerability, DNN-based stereo matching is typically trained under\nthe so-called simulation to reality pipeline, and thus domain generalizability\nis an important problem. This paper proposes to rethink the learnable DNN-based\nfeature backbone towards adversarially-robust and domain generalizable stereo\nmatching, either by completely removing it or by applying it only to the left\nreference image. It computes the matching cost volume using the classic\nmulti-scale census transform (i.e., local binary pattern) of the raw input\nstereo images, followed by a stacked Hourglass head sub-network solving the\nmatching problem. In experiments, the proposed method is tested in the\nSceneFlow dataset and the KITTI2015 benchmark. It significantly improves the\nadversarial robustness, while retaining accuracy performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art methods. It also shows better generalizability from simulation\n(SceneFlow) to real (KITTI) datasets when no fine-tuning is used.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of how to identify samples from unseen categories\n(open-set classification) when there are only a few samples given from the seen\ncategories (few-shot setting). The challenge of learning a good abstraction for\na class with very few samples makes it extremely difficult to detect samples\nfrom the unseen categories; consequently, open-set recognition has received\nminimal attention in the few-shot setting. Most open-set few-shot\nclassification methods regularize the softmax score to indicate uniform\nprobability for open class samples but we argue that this approach is often\ninaccurate, especially at a fine-grained level. Instead, we propose a novel\nexemplar reconstruction-based meta-learning strategy for jointly detecting open\nclass samples, as well as, categorizing samples from seen classes via\nmetric-based classification. The exemplars, which act as representatives of a\nclass, can either be provided in the training dataset or estimated in the\nfeature domain.

The recent\ndevelopment of microservice architecture brings three major challenges (i.e.,\noperation, system scale, and monitoring complexities) to root cause analysis\n(RCA) in industrial settings. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we\npresent Groot, an event-graph-based approach for RCA. Groot constructs a\nreal-time causality graph based on events that summarize various types of\nmetrics, logs, and activities in the system under analysis. Moreover, to\nincorporate domain knowledge from site reliability engineering (SRE) engineers,\nGroot can be customized with user-defined events and domain-specific rules.\nCurrently, Groot supports RCA among 5,000 real production services and is\nactively used by the SRE teamin a global e-commerce system serving more than\n185 million active buyers per year. Over 15 months, we collect a data\nsetcontaining labeled root causes of 952 real production incidents for\nevaluation. The evaluation results show that Groot is able to achieve 95% top-3\naccuracy and 78% top-1 accuracy. To share our experience in deploying and\nadopting RCA in industrial settings, we conduct survey to show that users of\nGrootfindit helpful and easy to use.

MRTA problems are known to be challenging when tasks\nrequire multiple robots and the team is composed of heterogeneous robots.

The\npre-trained image encoder can then be used as a feature extractor to build\ndownstream classifiers for many downstream tasks with a small amount of or no\nlabeled training data. In this work, we propose BadEncoder, the first backdoor\nattack to self-supervised learning. In particular, our BadEncoder injects\nbackdoors into a pre-trained image encoder such that the downstream classifiers\nbuilt based on the backdoored image encoder for different downstream tasks\nsimultaneously inherit the backdoor behavior. We formulate our BadEncoder as an\noptimization problem and we propose a gradient descent based method to solve\nit, which produces a backdoored image encoder from a clean one. Our extensive\nempirical evaluation results on multiple datasets show that our BadEncoder\nachieves high attack success rates while preserving the accuracy of the\ndownstream classifiers.

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising candidate\nsolution for data collection of large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In\nthis paper, we investigate a UAV-aided WSN, where cluster heads (CHs) receive\ndata from their member nodes, and a UAV is dispatched to collect data from CHs\nalong the planned trajectory. We aim to minimize the total energy consumption\nof the UAV-WSN system in a complete round of data collection. Toward this end,\nwe formulate the energy consumption minimization problem as a constrained\ncombinatorial optimization problem by jointly selecting CHs from nodes within\nclusters and planning the UAV's visiting order to the selected CHs. The\nformulated energy consumption minimization problem is NP-hard, and hence, hard\nto solve optimally. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose a novel deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) technique, pointer network-A* (Ptr-A*), which can\nefficiently learn from experiences the UAV trajectory policy for minimizing the\nenergy consumption. The UAV's start point and the WSN with a set of\npre-determined clusters are fed into the Ptr-A*, and the Ptr-A* outputs a group\nof CHs and the visiting order to these CHs, i.e., the UAV's trajectory. The\nparameters of the Ptr-A* are trained on small-scale clusters problem instances\nfor faster training by using the actor-critic algorithm in an unsupervised\nmanner. At inference, three search strategies are also proposed to improve the\nquality of solutions. Simulation results show that the trained models based on\n20-clusters and 40-clusters have a good generalization ability to solve the\nUAV's trajectory planning problem in WSNs with different numbers of clusters,\nwithout the need to retrain the models. Furthermore, the results show that our\nproposed DRL algorithm outperforms two baseline techniques.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning allows multiple participants to collaboratively train an\nefficient model without exposing data privacy. However, this distributed\nmachine learning training method is prone to attacks from Byzantine clients,\nwhich interfere with the training of the global model by modifying the model or\nuploading the false gradient. In this paper, we propose a novel serverless\nfederated learning framework Committee Mechanism based Federated Learning\n(CMFL), which can ensure the robustness of the algorithm with convergence\nguarantee. In CMFL, a committee system is set up to screen the uploaded local\ngradients. The committee system selects the local gradients rated by the\nelected members for the aggregation procedure through the selection strategy,\nand replaces the committee member through the election strategy. Based on the\ndifferent considerations of model performance and defense, two opposite\nselection strategies are designed for the sake of both accuracy and robustness.\nExtensive experiments illustrate that CMFL achieves faster convergence and\nbetter accuracy than the typical Federated Learning, in the meanwhile obtaining\nbetter robustness than the traditional Byzantine-tolerant algorithms, in the\nmanner of a decentralized approach. In addition, we theoretically analyze and\nprove the convergence of CMFL under different election and selection\nstrategies, which coincides with the experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Extreme multi-label classification (XML) involves tagging a data point with\nits most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set, with\nseveral applications such as product-to-product recommendation with millions of\nproducts. Although leading XML algorithms scale to millions of labels, they\nlargely ignore label meta-data such as textual descriptions of the labels.

DECAF makes specific contributions to model\narchitecture design, initialization, and training, enabling it to offer up to\n2-6% more accurate prediction than leading extreme classifiers on publicly\navailable benchmark product-to-product recommendation datasets, such as\nLF-AmazonTitles-1.3M. At the same time, DECAF was found to be up to 22x faster\nat inference than leading deep extreme classifiers, which makes it suitable for\nreal-time applications that require predictions within a few milliseconds.

To differentiate\namong samples, we train our model to predict the regression error after each\niteration.

We analyze the patch attention data\nto infer where the model is attending when regressing facial landmarks and\ncompare it to face attention in humans.

The diagnosis of MVI needs discovering the vessels that contain\nhepatocellular carcinoma cells and counting their number in each vessel, which\ndepends heavily on experiences of the doctor, is largely subjective and\ntime-consuming. However, there is no algorithm as yet tailored for the MVI\ndetection from pathological images. This paper collects the first pathological\nliver image dataset containing 522 whole slide images with labels of vessels,\nMVI, and hepatocellular carcinoma grades. The first and essential step for the\nautomatic diagnosis of MVI is the accurate segmentation of vessels. The unique\ncharacteristics of pathological liver images, such as super-large size,\nmulti-scale vessel, and blurred vessel edges, make the accurate vessel\nsegmentation challenging. Based on the collected dataset, we propose an\nEdge-competing Vessel Segmentation Network (EVS-Net), which contains a\nsegmentation network and two edge segmentation discriminators. The segmentation\nnetwork, combined with an edge-aware self-supervision mechanism, is devised to\nconduct vessel segmentation with limited labeled patches. Meanwhile, two\ndiscriminators are introduced to distinguish whether the segmented vessel and\nbackground contain residual features in an adversarial manner. In the training\nstage, two discriminators are devised tocompete for the predicted position of\nedges. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with only limited labeled\npatches, EVS-Net achieves a close performance of fully supervised methods,\nwhich provides a convenient tool for the pathological liver vessel\nsegmentation.

The\nbackbone network architecture is based on YOLOv4, but we could compress the\nnetwork greatly by replacing the high-calculation-load CSP DenseNet with the\nlighter modules of ShuffleNet. Experiments with KITTI dataset showed that the\nproposed YOffleNet is compressed by 4.7 times than the YOLOv4-s that could\nachieve as fast as 46 FPS on an embedded GPU system(NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier).\nCompared to the high compression ratio, the accuracy is reduced slightly to\n85.8% mAP, that is only 2.6% lower than YOLOv4-s. Thus, the proposed network\nshowed a high potential to be deployed on the embedded system of the autonomous\nsystem for the real-time and accurate object detection applications.",

    "abstract": "Graph matching is an important problem that has received widespread\nattention, especially in the field of computer vision. Recently,\nstate-of-the-art methods seek to incorporate graph matching with deep learning.\nHowever, there is no research to explain what role the graph matching algorithm\nplays in the model. Therefore, we propose an approach integrating a MILP\nformulation of the graph matching problem. This formulation is solved to\noptimal and it provides inherent baseline. Meanwhile, similar approaches are\nderived by releasing the optimal guarantee of the graph matching solver and by\nintroducing a quality level. This quality level controls the quality of the\nsolutions provided by the graph matching solver. In addition, several\nrelaxations of the graph matching problem are put to the test.

The idea of transferring prior object knowledge\nfrom humans to scene recognition is significant but still less exploited.

Therefore, developing effective scene\nrepresentation and recognition methods are of significant importance in\nrobotics. Currently, a large body of research focuses on developing novel\nauxiliary features and networks to improve indoor scene recognition ability.\nHowever, few of them focus on directly constructing object features and\nrelations for indoor scene recognition. In this paper, we analyze the\nweaknesses of current methods and propose an Object-to-Scene (OTS) method,\nwhich extracts object features and learns object relations to recognize indoor\nscenes. The proposed OTS first extracts object features based on the\nsegmentation network and the proposed object feature aggregation module (OFAM).\nAfterwards, the object relations are calculated and the scene representation is\nconstructed based on the proposed object attention module (OAM) and global\nrelation aggregation module (GRAM). The final results in this work show that\nOTS successfully extracts object features and learns object relations from the\nsegmentation network. Moreover, OTS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by\nmore than 2\\% on indoor scene recognition without using any additional streams.\nCode is publicly available at: https://github.com/FreeformRobotics/OTS.",

Many semantic segmentation methods based\non traditional deep learning insufficiently captured the semantic and\nappearance information of images, which put limit on their generality and\nrobustness for various application scenes. In this paper, we proposed a novel\nstrategy that reformulated the popularly-used convolution operation to\nmulti-layer convolutional sparse coding block to ease the aforementioned\ndeficiency. This strategy can be possibly used to significantly improve the\nsegmentation performance of any semantic segmentation model that involves\nconvolutional operations. To prove the effectiveness of our idea, we chose the\nwidely-used U-Net model for the demonstration purpose, and we designed CSC-Unet\nmodel series based on U-Net. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we\nprovided credible evidence showing that the multi-layer convolutional sparse\ncoding block enables semantic segmentation model to converge faster, can\nextract finer semantic and appearance information of images, and improve the\nability to recover spatial detail information. The best CSC-Unet model\nsignificantly outperforms the results of the original U-Net on three public\ndatasets with different scenarios, i.e., 87.14% vs. 84.71% on DeepCrack\ndataset, 68.91% vs. 67.09% on Nuclei dataset, and 53.68% vs. 48.82% on CamVid\ndataset, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Virtually indexed and virtually tagged (VIVT) caches are an attractive option\nfor micro-processor level-1 caches, because of their fast response time and\nbecause they are cheaper to implement than more complex caches such as\nvirtually-indexed physical-tagged (VIPT) caches. The level-1 VIVT cache becomes\neven simpler to construct if it is implemented as a direct-mapped cache\n(VIVT-DM cache). However, VIVT and VIVT-DM caches have some drawbacks. When the\nnumber of sets in the cache is larger than the smallest page size, there is a\npossibility of synonyms (two or more virtual addresses mapped to the same\nphysical address) existing in the cache. Further, maintenance of cache\ncoherence across multiple processors requires a physical to virtual translation\nmechanism in the hardware.

    "abstract": "Charts are used to measure relative success for a large variety of cultural\nitems. Traditional music charts have been shown to follow self-organizing\nprinciples with regard to the distribution of item lifetimes, the on-chart\nresidence times. Here we examine if this observation holds also for (a) music\nstreaming charts (b) book best-seller lists and (c) for social network activity\ncharts, such as Twitter hashtags and the number of comments Reddit postings\nreceive. We find that charts based on the active production of items, like\ncommenting, are more likely to be influenced by external factors, in particular\nby the 24 hour day-night cycle. External factors are less important for\nconsumption-based charts (sales, downloads), which can be explained by a\ngeneric theory of decision-making. In this view, humans aim to optimize the\ninformation content of the internal representation of the outside world, which\nis logarithmically compressed. Further support for information maximization is\nargued to arise from the comparison of hourly, daily and weekly charts, which\nallow to gauge the importance of decision times with respect to the chart\ncompilation period.",

    "abstract": "Text style transfer aims to alter the style (e.g., sentiment) of a sentence\nwhile preserving its content. A common approach is to map a given sentence to\ncontent representation that is free of style, and the content representation is\nfed to a decoder with a target style. Previous methods in filtering style\ncompletely remove tokens with style at the token level, which incurs the loss\nof content information. In this paper, we propose to enhance content\npreservation by implicitly removing the style information of each token with\nreverse attention, and thereby retain the content. Furthermore, we fuse content\ninformation when building the target style representation, making it dynamic\nwith respect to the content. Our method creates not only style-independent\ncontent representation, but also content-dependent style representation in\ntransferring style. Empirical results show that our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines by a large margin in terms of content preservation.\nIn addition, it is also competitive in terms of style transfer accuracy and\nfluency.",

Existing methods\nmainly focus on upsampling sparse point clouds in a supervised manner by using\ndense ground truth point clouds. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised\npoint cloud upsampling network (SSPU-Net) to generate dense point clouds\nwithout using ground truth. To achieve this, we exploit the consistency between\nthe input sparse point cloud and generated dense point cloud for the shapes and\nrendered images. Specifically, we first propose a neighbor expansion unit (NEU)\nto upsample the sparse point clouds, where the local geometric structures of\nthe sparse point clouds are exploited to learn weights for point interpolation.\nThen, we develop a differentiable point cloud rendering unit (DRU) as an\nend-to-end module in our network to render the point cloud into multi-view\nimages. Finally, we formulate a shape-consistent loss and an image-consistent\nloss to train the network so that the shapes of the sparse and dense point\nclouds are as consistent as possible.

    "abstract": "Existing anomaly detection paradigms overwhelmingly focus on training\ndetection models using exclusively normal data or unlabeled data (mostly normal\nsamples). One notorious issue with these approaches is that they are weak in\ndiscriminating anomalies from normal samples due to the lack of the knowledge\nabout the anomalies. Here, we study the problem of few-shot anomaly detection,\nin which we aim at using a few labeled anomaly examples to train\nsample-efficient discriminative detection models. To address this problem, we\nintroduce a novel weakly-supervised anomaly detection framework to train\ndetection models without assuming the examples illustrating all possible\nclasses of anomaly.\nSpecifically, the proposed approach learns discriminative normality\n(regularity) by leveraging the labeled anomalies and a prior probability to\nenforce expressive representations of normality and unbounded deviated\nrepresentations of abnormality. This is achieved by an end-to-end optimization\nof anomaly scores with a neural deviation learning, in which the anomaly scores\nof normal samples are imposed to approximate scalar scores drawn from the prior\nwhile that of anomaly examples is enforced to have statistically significant\ndeviations from these sampled scores in the upper tail. Furthermore, our model\nis optimized to learn fine-grained normality and abnormality by top-K\nmultiple-instance-learning-based feature subspace deviation learning, allowing\nmore generalized representations. Comprehensive experiments on nine real-world\nimage anomaly detection benchmarks show that our model is substantially more\nsample-efficient and robust, and performs significantly better than\nstate-of-the-art competing methods in both closed-set and open-set settings.\nOur model can also offer explanation capability as a result of its prior-driven\nanomaly score learning.

    "title": "On the Success Probability of Three Detectors for the Box-Constrained  Integer Linear Model",
    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with detecting an integer parameter vector inside a\nbox from a linear model that is corrupted with a noise vector following the\nGaussian distribution. One of the commonly used detectors is the maximum\nlikelihood detector, which is obtained by solving a box-constrained integer\nleast squares problem, that is NP-hard. Two other popular detectors are the\nbox-constrained rounding and Babai detectors due to their high efficiency of\nimplementation. In this paper, we first present formulas for the success\nprobabilities (the probabilities of correct detection) of these three detectors\nfor two different situations: the integer parameter vector is deterministic and\nis uniformly distributed over the constraint box. Then, we give two simple\nexamples to respectively show that the success probability of the\nbox-constrained rounding detector can be larger than that of the\nbox-constrained Babai detector and the latter can be larger than the success\nprobability of the maximum likelihood detector when the parameter vector is\ndeterministic, and prove that the success probability of the box-constrained\nrounding detector is always not larger than that of the box-constrained Babai\ndetector when the parameter vector is uniformly distributed over the constraint\nbox. Some relations between the results for the box constrained and ordinary\ncases are presented, and two bounds on the success probability of the maximum\nlikelihood detector, which can easily be computed, are developed. Finally,\nsimulation results are provided to illustrate our main theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "Given the damages from earthquakes, seismic isolation of critical\ninfrastructure is vital to mitigate losses due to seismic events. A promising\napproach for seismic isolation systems is metamaterials-based wave barriers.\nMetamaterials -- engineered composites -- manipulate the propagation and\nattenuation of seismic waves. Borrowing ideas from phononic and sonic crystals,\nthe central goal of a metamaterials-based wave barrier is to create band gaps\nthat cover the frequencies of seismic waves. The two quantities of interest\n(QoIs) that characterize band-gaps are the first-frequency cutoff and the\nband-gap's width. Researchers often use analytical (band-gap analysis),\nexperimental (shake table tests), and statistical (global variance) approaches\nto tailor the QoIs. However, these approaches are expensive and\ncompute-intensive. So, a pressing need exists for alternative easy-to-use\nmethods to quantify the correlation between input (design) parameters and QoIs.\nTo quantify such a correlation, in this paper, we will use Shapley values, a\ntechnique from the cooperative game theory. In addition, we will develop\nmachine learning models that can predict the QoIs for a given set of input\n(material and geometrical) parameters.",

Existing machine reading comprehension approaches in\nclinical domain can only handle questions about a single block of clinical\ntexts and fail to retrieve information about different patients and clinical\nnotes. To handle more complex questions, we aim at creating knowledge base from\nclinical notes to link different patients and clinical notes, and performing\nknowledge base question answering (KBQA). Based on the expert annotations in\nn2c2, we first created the ClinicalKBQA dataset that includes 8,952 QA pairs\nand covers questions about seven medical topics through 322 question templates.\nThen, we proposed an attention-based aspect reasoning (AAR) method for KBQA and\ninvestigated the impact of different aspects of answers (e.g., entity, type,\npath, and context) for prediction. The AAR method achieves better performance\ndue to the well-designed encoder and attention mechanism. In the experiments,\nwe find that both aspects, type and path, enable the model to identify answers\nsatisfying the general conditions and produce lower precision and higher\nrecall. On the other hand, the aspects, entity and context, limit the answers\nby node-specific information and lead to higher precision and lower recall.",

    "abstract": "Tracking the 6D pose of objects in video sequences is important for robot\nmanipulation. Most prior efforts, however, often assume that the target\nobject's CAD model, at least at a category-level, is available for offline\ntraining or during online template matching. This work proposes BundleTrack, a\ngeneral framework for 6D pose tracking of novel objects, which does not depend\nupon 3D models, either at the instance or category-level. It leverages the\ncomplementary attributes of recent advances in deep learning for segmentation\nand robust feature extraction, as well as memory-augmented pose graph\noptimization for spatiotemporal consistency. This enables long-term, low-drift\ntracking under various challenging scenarios, including significant occlusions\nand object motions. Comprehensive experiments given two public benchmarks\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-art,\ncategory-level 6D tracking or dynamic SLAM methods. When compared against\nstate-of-art methods that rely on an object instance CAD model, comparable\nperformance is achieved, despite the proposed method's reduced information\nrequirements. An efficient implementation in CUDA provides a real-time\nperformance of 10Hz for the entire framework. Code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/wenbowen123/BundleTrack",

Startups are an important topic for\nresearch and development. The fundamentals of success are the characteristics\nof individuals and teams, partner investors, the market, and the speed at which\neverything evolves. Startup's business environment is fraught with uncertainty,\nas actors tend to be young and inexperienced, technologies either new or\nrapidly evolving, and team-combined skills and knowledge either key or fatal.\nAs over 90 per cent of software startups fail, having a capable and reliable\nteam is crucial to survival and success.\nMany aspects of this topic have been extensively studied, and the results of\nthe study on human capital are particularly important. Regarding human capital\nabilities, such as knowledge, experience, skills, and other cognitive\nabilities, this dissertation focuses on design skills and their deployment in\nstartups. Design is widely studied in artistic and industrial contexts, but its\napplication to startup culture and software startups follows its own method\nprison. In the method prison, old and conventional means are chosen instead of\nnew techniques and demanding design studies. This means that when a software\nstartup considers design as a foundation for creativity and generating better\nofferings, they can grab any industry with a disruptive agenda, making anything\nsoftware-intensive.",

The current literature on hate speech detection leverages\nprimarily the textual content to find hateful posts and subsequently identify\nhateful users. However, this methodology disregards the social connections\nbetween users. In this paper, we run a detailed exploration of the problem\nspace and investigate an array of models ranging from purely textual to graph\nbased to finally semi-supervised techniques using Graph Neural Networks (GNN)\nthat utilize both textual and graph-based features. We run exhaustive\nexperiments on two datasets -- Gab, which is loosely moderated and Twitter,\nwhich is strictly moderated. Overall the AGNN model achieves 0.791 macro\nF1-score on the Gab dataset and 0.780 macro F1-score on the Twitter dataset\nusing only 5% of the labeled instances, considerably outperforming all the\nother models including the fully supervised ones. We perform detailed error\nanalysis on the best performing text and graph based models and observe that\nhateful users have unique network neighborhood signatures and the AGNN model\nbenefits by paying attention to these signatures. This property, as we observe,\nalso allows the model to generalize well across platforms in a zero-shot\nsetting.

    "abstract": "Accurate localization on autonomous driving cars is essential for autonomy\nand driving safety, especially for complex urban streets and search-and-rescue\nsubterranean environments where high-accurate GPS is not available. However\ncurrent odometry estimation may introduce the drifting problems in long-term\nnavigation without robust global localization. The main challenges involve\nscene divergence under the interference of dynamic environments and effective\nperception of observation and object layout variance from different viewpoints.\nTo tackle these challenges, we present PSE-Match, a viewpoint-free place\nrecognition method based on parallel semantic analysis of isolated semantic\nattributes from 3D point-cloud models. Compared with the original point cloud,\nthe observed variance of semantic attributes is smaller. PSE-Match incorporates\na divergence place learning network to capture different semantic attributes\nparallelly through the spherical harmonics domain. Using both existing\nbenchmark datasets and two in-field collected datasets, our experiments show\nthat the proposed method achieves above 70% average recall with top one\nretrieval and above 95% average recall with top ten retrieval cases.

As the performance\nrequirements of ML applications grow continuously, the hardware accelerators\nstart playing a central role in DNN design. This trend makes NAS even more\ncomplicated and time-consuming for most real applications. This paper proposes\nFLASH, a very fast NAS methodology that co-optimizes the DNN accuracy and\nperformance on a real hardware platform. As the main theoretical contribution,\nwe first propose the NN-Degree, an analytical metric to quantify the\ntopological characteristics of DNNs with skip connections (e.g., DenseNets,\nResNets, Wide-ResNets, and MobileNets). The newly proposed NN-Degree allows us\nto do training-free NAS within one second and build an accuracy predictor by\ntraining as few as 25 samples out of a vast search space with more than 63\nbillion configurations. Second, by performing inference on the target hardware,\nwe fine-tune and validate our analytical models to estimate the latency, area,\nand energy consumption of various DNN architectures while executing standard ML\ndatasets. Third, we construct a hierarchical algorithm based on simplicial\nhomology global optimization (SHGO) to optimize the model-architecture\nco-design process, while considering the area, latency, and energy consumption\nof the target hardware. We demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art\nNAS approaches, our proposed hierarchical SHGO-based algorithm enables more\nthan four orders of magnitude speedup (specifically, the execution time of the\nproposed algorithm is about 0.1 seconds). Finally, our experimental evaluations\nshow that FLASH is easily transferable to different hardware architectures,\nthus enabling us to do NAS on a Raspberry Pi-3B processor in less than 3\nseconds.",

These algorithms are computationally expensive on conventional\nprocessors, yet their statistical properties, namely interpretability and\nuncertainty quantification (UQ) compared to deep learning, make them an\nattractive alternative approach. Therefore, hardware specialization can be\nadopted to address the shortcomings of conventional processors in running these\napplications.\nIn this paper, we propose a high-throughput accelerator for Markov Random\nField (MRF) inference, a powerful model for representing a wide range of\napplications, using MCMC with Gibbs sampling.

    "abstract": "The benefits that arise from the adoption of a systems engineering approach\nto the design of engineered systems are well understood and documented. However\n, with software systems, different approaches are required given the\nchangeability of requirements and the malleability of software. With the design\nof industrial cyber-physical systems, one is confronted with the challenge of\ndesigning engineered systems that have a significant software component.\nFurthermore, that software component must be able to seamlessly interact with\nboth the enterprise's business systems and industrial systems. In this paper,\nwe present Janus, which together with the GORITE BDI agent framework, provides\na methodology for the design of agent-based industrial cyber-physical systems.\nCentral to the Janus approach is the development of a logical architecture as\nin traditional systems engineering and then the allocation of the logical\nrequirements to a BDI (Belief Desire Intention) agent architecture which is\nderived from the physical architecture for the system. Janus has its origins in\nproduct manufacturing; in this paper, we apply it to the problem of Fault\nLocation, Isolation and Service Restoration (FLISR) for power substations.",

    "title": "Exact Pareto Optimal Search for Multi-Task Learning: Touring the Pareto  Front",
    "abstract": "Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a well-established paradigm for training deep\nneural network models for multiple correlated tasks. Often the task objectives\nconflict, requiring trade-offs between them during model building. In such\ncases, MTL models can use gradient-based multi-objective optimization (MOO) to\nfind one or more Pareto optimal solutions. A common requirement in MTL\napplications is to find an {\\it Exact} Pareto optimal (EPO) solution, which\nsatisfies user preferences with respect to task-specific objective functions.\nFurther, to improve model generalization, various constraints on the weights\nmay need to be enforced during training. Addressing these requirements is\nchallenging because it requires a search direction that allows descent not only\ntowards the Pareto front but also towards the input preference, within the\nconstraints imposed and in a manner that scales to high-dimensional gradients.\nWe design and theoretically analyze such search directions and develop the\nfirst scalable algorithm, with theoretical guarantees of convergence, to find\nan EPO solution, including when box and equality constraints are imposed. Our\nunique method combines multiple gradient descent with carefully controlled\nascent to traverse the Pareto front in a principled manner, making it robust to\ninitialization. This also facilitates systematic exploration of the Pareto\nfront, that we utilize to approximate the Pareto front for multi-criteria\ndecision-making. Empirical results show that our algorithm outperforms\ncompeting methods on benchmark MTL datasets and MOO problems.",

In the sub-1 GHz UHF band where only SISO deployment is possible,\ninterference aware receiver algorithms are essential to mitigate the ITI. In\nthis work, we develop a Joint Modified Least Squares (JmLS) algorithm for\nchannel estimation in the presence of ITI. Firstly, it is shown that the JmLS\nalgorithm achieves the Cramer-Rao lower bound. Next, an approach to managing\nthe possibly distinct carrier frequency offsets of the different co-channel\nsignals of interest is proposed. This improves the quality of the bit-level\nJoint Log-Likelihood Ratio. Finally, the impact of the choice of pilot\nsub-carrier information in the block modulated air-interface on the coded block\nerror rate performance is studied. In particular, a comparison is made between\n(i) frequency orthogonal pilots from the different sectors, vis-a-vis, (ii) a\npilot-on-pilot arrangement using pseudo-orthogonal sequences.

To bridge this gap, an implicit generative model with Wasserstein GAN\nobjectives, namely unbalanced graph generative adversarial network (UG-GAN), is\ndesigned to generate synthetic three-phase unbalanced active distribution\nsystem connectivity. The basic idea is to learn the distribution of random\nwalks both over a real-world system and across each phase of line segments,\ncapturing the underlying local properties of an individual real-world\ndistribution network and generating specific synthetic networks accordingly.\nThen, to create a comprehensive synthetic test case, a network correction and\nextension process is proposed to obtain time-series nodal demands and standard\ndistribution grid components with realistic parameters, including distributed\nenergy resources (DERs) and capacity banks. A Midwest distribution system with\n1-year SM data has been utilized to validate the performance of our method.\nCase studies with several power applications demonstrate that synthetic active\nnetworks generated by the proposed framework can mimic almost all features of\nreal-world networks while avoiding the disclosure of confidential information.",

We propose a multi-stage\nProgressive Upsampling and Inpainting Generative Adversarial Network, dubbed\nPro-UIGAN, which exploits facial geometry priors to replenish and upsample (8*)\nthe occluded and tiny faces (16*16 pixels). Pro-UIGAN iteratively (1) estimates\nfacial geometry priors for low-resolution (LR) faces and (2) acquires\nnon-occluded HR face images under the guidance of the estimated priors. Our\nmulti-stage hallucination network super-resolves and inpaints occluded LR faces\nin a coarse-to-fine manner, thus reducing unwanted blurriness and artifacts\nsignificantly. Specifically, we design a novel cross-modal transformer module\nfor facial priors estimation, in which an input face and its landmark features\nare formulated as queries and keys, respectively. Such a design encourages\njoint feature learning across the input facial and landmark features, and deep\nfeature correspondences will be discovered by attention. Thus, facial\nappearance features and facial geometry priors are learned in a mutual\npromotion manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Pro-UIGAN achieves\nvisually pleasing HR faces, reaching superior performance in downstream tasks,\ni.e., face alignment, face parsing, face recognition and expression\nclassification, compared with other state-of-the-art (SotA) methods.",

    "abstract": "With the growing DRAM capacity and core count in modern servers, database\nsystems are becoming increasingly multi-engine to feature a heterogeneous set\nof engines. In particular, a memory-optimized engine and a conventional\nstorage-centric engine may coexist for various application needs. However,\nhandling cross-engine transactions that access more than one engine remains\nchallenging in terms of correctness, performance and programmability.\nThis paper describes Skeena, a holistic approach to cross-engine\ntransactions. We propose a lightweight transaction tracking structure and an\natomic commit protocol to ensure correctness and support various isolation\nlevels in multi-engine systems. Evaluation on a 40-core server shows that\nSkeena (1) does not penalize single-engine transactions and (2) enables the use\nof cross-engine transactions to improve throughput by up to 30x and/or reduce\nstorage cost by judiciously placing tables in different engines.",

However, we still have little understanding of the\nactivities of SWM livestream and the streamer's motivation to produce SWM\nlivestream. This paper provides an overview of the activities and how streamers\nregulate these activities of SWM livestream on a Chinese popular User Generated\nContent(UGC) website, Bilibili. We observed the number and popularity of the\nSWM livestreams and analyzed 800 livestreams to understand the streamers' study\ngoals. We analyzed 20 SWM livestreams in detail and interviewed 12 streamers\nand 10 viewers to understand the activities and the streamer's motivation. We\nfound that streamers produced SWM livestream to seek supervision, find\nlike-minded study partners and help and company others. Streamers don't\ninteract or instruct with the viewers directly but use chat-bot and autonomous\ninteraction to alleviated the interaction burden. Unique sessions like\nchecking-in and study progress reporting promote the viewers' social presence,\npromoting SOC, and enhancing their engagement. Strict rules and punishment are\nwidely used to concentrate the members on study and contribute to positive\natmosphere. We also found that SWM livestream often disappears when the\nexamination is done and the streamer faces doubts on motivation and appearance.\nThese findings suggest that SRL community can provide cognitive and\nsocioemotional support for lonely learners to stick to a long-term study. The\nactivities and streamer's practice inspired how streamers can focus on\ncontemplative efforts while controlling the interaction.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Information Retrieval community has witnessed fast-paced advances\nin Dense Retrieval (DR), which performs first-stage retrieval by encoding\ndocuments in a low-dimensional embedding space and querying them with\nembedding-based search. Despite the impressive ranking performance, previous\nstudies usually adopt brute-force search to acquire candidates, which is\nprohibitive in practical Web search scenarios due to its tremendous memory\nusage and time cost. To overcome these problems, vector compression methods, a\nbranch of Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), have been adopted in many\npractical embedding-based retrieval applications. One of the most popular\nmethods is Product Quantization (PQ). However, although existing vector\ncompression methods including PQ can help improve the efficiency of DR, they\nincur severely decayed retrieval performance due to the separation between\nencoding and compression. To tackle this problem, we present JPQ, which stands\nfor Joint optimization of query encoding and Product Quantization. It trains\nthe query encoder and PQ index jointly in an end-to-end manner based on three\noptimization strategies, namely ranking-oriented loss, PQ centroid\noptimization, and end-to-end negative sampling. We evaluate JPQ on two publicly\navailable retrieval benchmarks. Experimental results show that JPQ\nsignificantly outperforms existing popular vector compression methods in terms\nof different trade-off settings. Compared with previous DR models that use\nbrute-force search, JPQ almost matches the best retrieval performance with 30x\ncompression on index size. The compressed index further brings 10x speedup on\nCPU and 2x speedup on GPU in query latency.",

    "abstract": "Taking advantage of the rich information provided by Wi-Fi measurement\nsetups, Wi-Fi-based human behavior sensing leveraging Channel State Information\n(CSI) measurements has received a lot of research attention in recent years.\nThe CSI-based human sensing algorithms typically either rely on an explicit\nchannel propagation model or, more recently, adopt machine learning so as to\nrobustify feature extraction. In most related work, the considered CSI is\nextracted from a single dedicated Access Point (AP) communication setup. In\nthis paper, we consider a more realistic setting where a legacy network of\nmultiple APs is already deployed for communications purposes and leveraged for\nsensing benefits using machine learning. The use of legacy network presents\nchallenges and opportunities as many Wi-Fi links can present with richer yet\nunequally useful data sets. In order to break the curse of dimensionality\nassociated with training over a too large dimensional CSI, we propose a link\nselection mechanism based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) which allows for\ndimension reduction while preserving the data that is most relevant for human\nbehavior sensing. The method is based on a sequential state decision-making\nprocess in which the CSI is modeled as a part of the state. From actual\nexperiment results, our method is shown to perform better than state-of-the-art\napproaches in a scenario with multiple available Wi-Fi links.",

    "abstract": "Automated tagging of video advertisements has been a critical yet challenging\nproblem, and it has drawn increasing interests in last years as its\napplications seem to be evident in many fields. Despite sustainable efforts\nhave been made, the tagging task is still suffered from several challenges,\nsuch as, efficiently feature fusion approach is desirable, but under-explored\nin previous studies. In this paper, we present our approach for Multimodal\nVideo Ads Tagging in the 2021 Tencent Advertising Algorithm Competition.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel multi-modal feature fusion framework, with the\ngoal to combine complementary information from multiple modalities. This\nframework introduces stacking-based ensembling approach to reduce the influence\nof varying levels of noise and conflicts between different modalities. Thus,\nour framework can boost the performance of the tagging task, compared to\nprevious methods. To empirically investigate the effectiveness and robustness\nof the proposed framework, we conduct extensive experiments on the challenge\ndatasets. The obtained results suggest that our framework can significantly\noutperform related approaches and our method ranks as the 1st place on the\nfinal leaderboard, with a Global Average Precision (GAP) of 82.63%. To better\npromote the research in this field, we will release our code in the final\nversion.",

    "abstract": "Many current deep learning approaches make extensive use of backbone networks\npre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet, which are then fine-tuned to\nperform a certain task. In remote sensing, the lack of comparable large\nannotated datasets and the wide diversity of sensing platforms impedes similar\ndevelopments. In order to contribute towards the availability of pre-trained\nbackbone networks in remote sensing, we devise a self-supervised approach for\npre-training deep neural networks. By exploiting the correspondence between\ngeo-tagged audio recordings and remote sensing imagery, this is done in a\ncompletely label-free manner, eliminating the need for laborious manual\nannotation. For this purpose, we introduce the SoundingEarth dataset, which\nconsists of co-located aerial imagery and audio samples all around the world.\nUsing this dataset, we then pre-train ResNet models to map samples from both\nmodalities into a common embedding space, which encourages the models to\nunderstand key properties of a scene that influence both visual and auditory\nappearance. To validate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we evaluate\nthe transfer learning performance of pre-trained weights obtained against\nweights obtained through other means. By fine-tuning the models on a number of\ncommonly used remote sensing datasets, we show that our approach outperforms\nexisting pre-training strategies for remote sensing imagery.

Instead of predicting facial\nlandmarks via heatmap or coordinate regression, we formulate this task in a\ndiffeomorphic registration manner and predict momenta that uniquely\nparameterize the deformation between initial boundary and true boundary, and\nthen perform large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM)\nsimultaneously for curve and landmark to localize the facial landmarks. Due to\nthe embedding of LDDMM into a deep network, LDDMM-Face can consistently\nannotate facial landmarks without ambiguity and flexibly handle various\nannotation schemes, and can even predict dense annotations from sparse ones.\nOur method can be easily integrated into various face alignment networks. We\nextensively evaluate LDDMM-Face on four benchmark datasets: 300W, WFLW, HELEN\nand COFW-68. LDDMM-Face is comparable or superior to state-of-the-art methods\nfor traditional within-dataset and same-annotation settings, but truly\ndistinguishes itself with outstanding performance when dealing with\nweakly-supervised learning (partial-to-full), challenging cases (e.g., occluded\nfaces), and different training and prediction datasets.

In most of the drone and unmanned\naerial vehicle (UAV) based systems supporting SAR missions, several drones\ndeployed in different areas acquire images and videos that are sent to a ground\ncontrol station (GCS) for processing and detecting a missing person. Although\nthis offers many advantages, such as easy management and deployment, the\napproach still has many limitations.

Currently, many practitioners prefer the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)\ndue to its simplicity and reliability, despite its few drawbacks. While most\nprevious functions proposed to supplant ReLU have been hand-designed, recent\nwork on learning the function during training has shown promising results. In\nthis paper we propose an adaptive piecewise linear activation function, the\nPiecewise Linear Unit (PiLU), which can be learned independently for each\ndimension of the neural network. We demonstrate how PiLU is a generalised\nrectifier unit and note its similarities with the Adaptive Piecewise Linear\nUnits, namely adaptive and piecewise linear. Across a distribution of 30\nexperiments, we show that for the same model architecture, hyperparameters, and\npre-processing, PiLU significantly outperforms ReLU: reducing classification\nerror by 18.53% on CIFAR-10 and 13.13% on CIFAR-100, for a minor increase in\nthe number of neurons.

To solve this problem and further\ndevelop the OMR systems, in this paper, we categorize the tasks related to OMR\nchassis into orientation transition tasks and position transition tasks, where\nthe two tasks can be carried out at the same time. By integrating the parallel\ntask goals in a single planning problem, we proposed an orientation-aware\nplanning architecture for OMR systems to execute the orientation transition and\nposition transition in a unified and efficient way. A modified trajectory\noptimization method called orientation-aware timed-elastic-band (OATEB) is\nintroduced to generate the trajectory that satisfies the requirements of both\ntasks. Experiments in both 2D simulated environments and real scenes are\ncarried out. A four-wheeled OMR is deployed to conduct the real scene\nexperiment and the results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of\nsimultaneously executing parallel tasks and is applicable to real-life\nscenarios.",

We present a Multi-modal Semantics enhanced\nJoint Embedding approach (MSJE) for learning a common feature space between the\ntwo modalities (text and image), with the ultimate goal of providing\nhigh-performance cross-modal retrieval services. Our MSJE approach has three\nunique features. First, we extract the TFIDF feature from the title,\ningredients and cooking instructions of recipes. By determining the\nsignificance of word sequences through combining LSTM learned features with\ntheir TFIDF features, we encode a recipe into a TFIDF weighted vector for\ncapturing significant key terms and how such key terms are used in the\ncorresponding cooking instructions. Second, we combine the recipe TFIDF feature\nwith the recipe sequence feature extracted through two-stage LSTM networks,\nwhich is effective in capturing the unique relationship between a recipe and\nits associated image(s). Third, we further incorporate TFIDF enhanced category\nsemantics to improve the mapping of image modality and to regulate the\nsimilarity loss function during the iterative learning of cross-modal joint\nembedding.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a variational model for splines in the image\nmetamorphosis model for the the smooth interpolation of key frames in the space\nof images. The original metamorphosis model is based on a simultaneous\ntransport of image intensities and a modulation of intensities along motion\ntrajectories and the energy functional measures the motion velocity and the\nmaterial derivative of the image intensity. As in the case of cubic splines in\nEuclidean space where cubic splines are known to minimize the squared\nacceleration along the interpolation path we consider different acceleration\nterms to define a spline metamorphis model. In fact, the proposed spline\nfunctional combines quadratic functionals of the Eulerian motion acceleration\nand of the second material derivative representing an acceleration in the\nchange of intensities along motion paths.\nFurthermore, a variational time discretization of this spline model is\nproposed and the convergence to a suitably relaxed time continuous model is\ndiscussed via $\\Gamma$-convergence methodology. As a byproduct, this also\nallows to establish the existence of metamorphosis splines for given key frame\nimages as minimizers of the continuous spline functional. An effective spatial\ndiscretization is proposed based on a finite difference discretization in space\ncombined with a stable B-spline interpolation of deformed quantities. A variety\nof numerical examples demonstrates the robustness and versatility of the\nproposed method in applications using a variant of the iPALM algorithm for the\nminimization of the fully discrete energy functional.",

Starting\nwith 387 parameters characterizing each well, including construction, reservoir\nproperties, fracturing design features and production, we end up with 38 key\nparameters used as input features for each well in the model training process.\nThe model demonstrates physically explainable dependencies plots of the target\non the design parameters (number of stages, proppant mass, average and final\nproppant concentrations and fluid rate).

Analyzing 166 participants responses from\nBrazil, South Korea, and the US, we examined the similarity between the ratings\nof nine categories of perceived moods in music and estimated their alignment\nwith four popular mood detection algorithms. We created a dataset of 360 recent\npop songs drawn from major music charts of the countries and constructed\nsemantically identical mood descriptors across English, Korean, and Portuguese\nlanguages. Multiple participants from the three countries rated their\nfamiliarity, preference, and perceived moods for a given song.

However, we found significant cross-cultural\ndifferences for more complex characteristics such as dreamy and love.

Our study thus suggests that the mood\ndetection algorithms can be considered as an objective measure at least within\nthe popular music context.",

    "abstract": "Retrieving answer passages from long documents is a complex task requiring\nsemantic understanding of both discourse and document context. We approach this\nchallenge specifically in a clinical scenario, where doctors retrieve cohorts\nof patients based on diagnoses and other latent medical aspects. We introduce\nCAPR, a rule-based self-supervision objective for training Transformer language\nmodels for domain-specific passage matching. In addition, we contribute a novel\nretrieval dataset based on clinical notes to simulate this scenario on a large\ncorpus of clinical notes. We apply our objective in four Transformer-based\narchitectures: Contextual Document Vectors, Bi-, Poly- and Cross-encoders. From\nour extensive evaluation on MIMIC-III and three other healthcare datasets, we\nreport that CAPR outperforms strong baselines in the retrieval of\ndomain-specific passages and effectively generalizes across rule-based and\nhuman-labeled passages. This makes the model powerful especially in zero-shot\nscenarios where only limited training data is available.",

    "abstract": "Meta-learning, or learning to learn, offers a principled framework for\nfew-shot learning. It leverages data from multiple related learning tasks to\ninfer an inductive bias that enables fast adaptation on a new task. The\napplication of meta-learning was recently proposed for learning how to\ndemodulate from few pilots. The idea is to use pilots received and stored for\noffline use from multiple devices in order to meta-learn an adaptation\nprocedure with the aim of speeding up online training on new devices. Standard\nfrequentist learning, which can yield relatively accurate \"hard\" classification\ndecisions, is known to be poorly calibrated, particularly in the small-data\nregime. Poor calibration implies that the soft scores output by the demodulator\nare inaccurate estimates of the true probability of correct demodulation. In\nthis work, we introduce the use of Bayesian meta-learning via variational\ninference for the purpose of obtaining well-calibrated few-pilot demodulators.\nIn a Bayesian framework, each neural network weight is represented by a\ndistribution, capturing epistemic uncertainty. Bayesian meta-learning optimizes\nover the prior distribution of the weights. The resulting Bayesian ensembles\noffer better calibrated soft decisions, at the computational cost of running\nmultiple instances of the neural network for demodulation. Numerical results\nfor single-input single-output Rayleigh fading channels with transmitter's\nnon-linearities are provided that compare symbol error rate and expected\ncalibration error for both frequentist and Bayesian meta-learning, illustrating\nhow the latter is both more accurate and better-calibrated.",

    "abstract": "During the first wave of COVID-19, hospitals were overwhelmed with the high\nnumber of admitted patients. An accurate prediction of the most likely\nindividual disease progression can improve the planning of limited resources\nand finding the optimal treatment for patients. However, when dealing with a\nnewly emerging disease such as COVID-19, the impact of patient- and\ndisease-specific factors (e.g. body weight or known co-morbidities) on the\nimmediate course of disease is by and large unknown. In the case of COVID-19,\nthe need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission of pneumonia patients is often\ndetermined only by acute indicators such as vital signs (e.g. breathing rate,\nblood oxygen levels), whereas statistical analysis and decision support systems\nthat integrate all of the available data could enable an earlier prognosis. To\nthis end, we propose a holistic graph-based approach combining both imaging and\nnon-imaging information. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal similarity\nmetric to build a population graph for clustering patients and an image-based\nend-to-end Graph Attention Network to process this graph and predict the\nCOVID-19 patient outcomes: admission to ICU, need for ventilation and\nmortality. Additionally, the network segments chest CT images as an auxiliary\ntask and extracts image features and radiomics for feature fusion with the\navailable metadata. Results on a dataset collected in Klinikum rechts der Isar\nin Munich, Germany show that our approach outperforms single modality and\nnon-graph baselines. Moreover, our clustering and graph attention allow for\nincreased understanding of the patient relationships within the population\ngraph and provide insight into the network's decision-making process.",

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to localize objects by only\nutilizing image-level labels. Class activation maps (CAMs) are the commonly\nused features to achieve WSOL. However, previous CAM-based methods did not take\nfull advantage of the shallow features, despite their importance for WSOL.\nBecause shallow features are easily buried in background noise through\nconventional fusion. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective Shallow\nfeature-aware Pseudo supervised Object Localization (SPOL) model for accurate\nWSOL, which makes the utmost of low-level features embedded in shallow layers.\nIn practice, our SPOL model first generates the CAMs through a novel\nelement-wise multiplication of shallow and deep feature maps, which filters the\nbackground noise and generates sharper boundaries robustly. Besides, we further\npropose a general class-agnostic segmentation model to achieve the accurate\nobject mask, by only using the initial CAMs as the pseudo label without any\nextra annotation. Eventually, a bounding box extractor is applied to the object\nmask to locate the target. Experiments verify that our SPOL outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art on both CUB-200 and ImageNet-1K benchmarks, achieving 93.44%\nand 67.15% (i.e., 3.93% and 2.13% improvement) Top-5 localization accuracy,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "The problem of domain adaptation conventionally considers the setting where a\nsource domain has plenty of labeled data, and a target domain (with a different\ndata distribution) has plenty of unlabeled data but none or very limited\nlabeled data. In this paper, we address the setting where the target domain has\nonly limited labeled data from a distribution that is expected to change\nfrequently. We first propose a fast and light-weight method for adapting a\nGaussian mixture density network (MDN) using only a small set of target domain\nsamples. This method is well-suited for the setting where the distribution of\ntarget data changes rapidly (e.g., a wireless channel), making it challenging\nto collect a large number of samples and retrain. We then apply the proposed\nMDN adaptation method to the problem of end-of-end learning of a wireless\ncommunication autoencoder. A communication autoencoder models the encoder,\ndecoder, and the channel using neural networks, and learns them jointly to\nminimize the overall decoding error rate. However, the error rate of an\nautoencoder trained on a particular (source) channel distribution can degrade\nas the channel distribution changes frequently, not allowing enough time for\ndata collection and retraining of the autoencoder to the target channel\ndistribution. We propose a method for adapting the autoencoder without\nmodifying the encoder and decoder neural networks, and adapting only the MDN\nmodel of the channel. The method utilizes feature transformations at the\ndecoder to compensate for changes in the channel distribution, and effectively\npresent to the decoder samples close to the source distribution. Experimental\nevaluation on simulated datasets and real mmWave wireless channels demonstrate\nthat the proposed methods can quickly adapt the MDN model, and improve or\nmaintain the error rate of the autoencoder under changing channel conditions.",

    "abstract": "Accurate polyp segmentation is of great importance for colorectal cancer\ndiagnosis. However, even with a powerful deep neural network, there still\nexists three big challenges that impede the development of polyp segmentation.\n(i) Samples collected under different conditions show inconsistent colors,\ncausing the feature distribution gap and overfitting issue; (ii) Due to\nrepeated feature downsampling, small polyps are easily degraded; (iii)\nForeground and background pixels are imbalanced, leading to a biased training.\nTo address the above issues, we propose the Shallow Attention Network (SANet)\nfor polyp segmentation. Specifically, to eliminate the effects of color, we\ndesign the color exchange operation to decouple the image contents and colors,\nand force the model to focus more on the target shape and structure.\nFurthermore, to enhance the segmentation quality of small polyps, we propose\nthe shallow attention module to filter out the background noise of shallow\nfeatures. Thanks to the high resolution of shallow features, small polyps can\nbe preserved correctly. In addition, to ease the severe pixel imbalance for\nsmall polyps, we propose a probability correction strategy (PCS) during the\ninference phase. Note that even though PCS is not involved in the training\nphase, it can still work well on a biased model and consistently improve the\nsegmentation performance.

    "abstract": "In model checking, when a given model fails to satisfy the desired\nspecification, a typical model checker provides a counterexample that\nillustrates how the violation occurs. In general, there exist many diverse\ncounterexamples that exhibit distinct violating behaviors, which the user may\nwish to examine before deciding how to repair the model. Unfortunately,\nobtaining this information is challenging in existing model checkers since (1)\nthe number of counterexamples may be too large to enumerate one by one, and (2)\nmany of these counterexamples are redundant, in that they describe the same\ntype of violating behavior. In this paper, we propose a technique called\ncounterexample classification. The goal of classification is to partition the\nspace of all counterexamples into a finite set of counterexample classes, each\nof which describes a distinct type of violating behavior for the given\nspecification. These classes are then presented as a summary of possible\nviolating behaviors in the system, freeing the user from manually having to\ninspect or analyze numerous counterexamples to extract the same information.

While the proliferation of data on disasters is\nalready helping to save lives, identifying damages in buildings, assessing\nshelter needs, and finding appropriate places to establish emergency shelters\nor settlements require a wide range of data to be combined rapidly. To address\nthis gap and make a headway in comprehensive assessments, this paper proposes a\nmachine learning workflow that aims to fuse and rapidly analyse multimodal\ndata. This workflow is built around open and online data to ensure scalability\nand broad accessibility. Based on a database of 19 characteristics for more\nthan 200 disasters worldwide, a fusion approach at the decision level was used.\nThis technique allows the collected multimodal data to share a common semantic\nspace that facilitates the prediction of individual variables.

The trained SOM serves as a predictor for future\ncases, allowing predicting consequences such as total deaths, total people\naffected, and total damage, and provides specific recommendations for\nassessments in the shelter and housing sector.

Along the vertical direction, we place\na PML to truncate the unbounded domain onto a strip and prove that the PML\nsolution converges linearly to the true solution in the physical subregion of\nthe strip with the PML thickness. Laterally, we divide the unbounded strip into\nthree regions: a region containing the defect and two semi-waveguide regions,\nseparated by two vertical line segments. In both semi-waveguides, we prove the\nwell-posedness of an associated scattering problem so as to well define a\nNeumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) operator on the associated vertical segment. The two\nNtD operators, serving as exact lateral boundary conditions, reformulate the\nunbounded strip problem as a boundary value problem onto the defected region.\nDue to the periodicity of the semi-waveguides, both NtD operators turn out to\nbe closely related to a Neumann-marching operator, governed by a nonlinear\nRiccati equation. It is proved that the Neumann-marching operators are\ncontracting, so that the PML solution decays exponentially fast along both\nlateral directions. The consequences culminate in two opposite aspects.\nNegatively, the PML solution cannot exponentially converge to the true solution\nin the whole physical region of the strip. Positively, from a numerical\nperspective, the Riccati equations can now be efficiently solved by a recursive\ndoubling procedure and a high-accuracy PML-based BIE method so that the\nboundary value problem on the defected region can be solved efficiently and\naccurately. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the PML solution converges\nexponentially fast to the true solution in any compact subdomain of the strip.",

    "abstract": "Weakly-Sticky(WS) Datalog+/- is an expressive member of the family of\nDatalog+/- program classes that is defined on the basis of the conditions of\nstickiness and weak-acyclicity. Conjunctive query answering (QA) over the WS\nprograms has been investigated, and its tractability in data complexity has\nbeen established. However, the design and implementation of practical QA\nalgorithms and their optimizations have been open. In order to fill this gap,\nwe first study Sticky and WS programs from the point of view of the behavior of\nthe chase procedure. We extend the stickiness property of the chase to that of\ngeneralized stickiness of the chase (GSCh) modulo an oracle that selects (and\nprovides) the predicate positions where finitely values appear during the\nchase. Stickiness modulo a selection function S that provides only a subset of\nthose positions defines sch(S), a semantic subclass of GSCh. Program classes\nwith selection functions include Sticky and WS, and another syntactic class\nthat we introduce and characterize, namely JWS, of jointly-weakly-sticky\nprograms, which contains WS. The selection functions for these last three\nclasses are computable, and no external, possibly non-computable oracle is\nneeded. We propose a bottom-up QA algorithm for programs in the class sch(S),\nfor a general selection S.As a particular case, we obtain a polynomial-time QA\nalgorithm for JWS and weakly-sticky programs. Unlike WS, JWS turns out to be\nclosed under magic-sets query optimization. As a consequence, both the generic\npolynomial-time QA algorithm and its magic-set optimization can be\nparticularized and applied to WS.",

    "abstract": "Human vision is often adversely affected by complex environmental factors,\nespecially in night vision scenarios. Thus, infrared cameras are often\nleveraged to help enhance the visual effects via detecting infrared radiation\nin the surrounding environment, but the infrared videos are undesirable due to\nthe lack of detailed semantic information. In such a case, an effective\nvideo-to-video translation method from the infrared domain to the visible light\ncounterpart is strongly needed by overcoming the intrinsic huge gap between\ninfrared and visible fields. To address this challenging problem, we propose an\ninfrared-to-visible (I2V) video translation method I2V-GAN to generate\nfine-grained and spatial-temporal consistent visible light videos by given\nunpaired infrared videos. Technically, our model capitalizes on three types of\nconstraints: 1)adversarial constraint to generate synthetic frames that are\nsimilar to the real ones, 2)cyclic consistency with the introduced perceptual\nloss for effective content conversion as well as style preservation, and\n3)similarity constraints across and within domains to enhance the content and\nmotion consistency in both spatial and temporal spaces at a fine-grained level.\nFurthermore, the current public available infrared and visible light datasets\nare mainly used for object detection or tracking, and some are composed of\ndiscontinuous images which are not suitable for video tasks. Thus, we provide a\nnew dataset for I2V video translation, which is named IRVI. Specifically, it\nhas 12 consecutive video clips of vehicle and monitoring scenes, and both\ninfrared and visible light videos could be apart into 24352 frames.\nComprehensive experiments validate that I2V-GAN is superior to the compared\nSOTA methods in the translation of I2V videos with higher fluency and finer\nsemantic details. The code and IRVI dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/BIT-DA/I2V-GAN.",

    "title": "Hardness and Approximation of Submodular Minimum Linear Ordering  Problems",
    "abstract": "The minimum linear ordering problem (MLOP) seeks to minimize an aggregated\ncost $f(\\cdot)$ due to an ordering $\\sigma$ of the items (say $[n]$), i.e.,\n$\\min_{\\sigma} \\sum_{i\\in [n]} f(E_{i,\\sigma})$, where $E_{i,\\sigma}$ is the\nset of items that are mapped by $\\sigma$ to indices at most $i$. This problem\nhas been studied in the literature for various special cases of the cost\nfunction $f$, and in a general setting for a submodular or supermodular cost\n$f$ [ITT2012]. Though MLOP was known to be NP-hard for general submodular\nfunctions, it was unknown whether the special case of graphic matroid MLOP\n(with $f$ being the matroid rank function of a graph) was polynomial-time\nsolvable. Following this motivation, we explore related classes of linear\nordering problems, including symmetric submodular MLOP, minimum latency vertex\ncover, and minimum sum vertex cover. We show that the most special cases of our\nproblem, graphic matroid MLOP and minimum latency vertex cover, are both\nNP-hard.\nWe further expand the toolkit for approximating MLOP variants: using the\ntheory of principal partitions, we show a $2-\\frac{1+\\ell_{f}}{1+|E|}$\napproximation to monotone submodular MLOP, where\n$\\ell_{f}=\\frac{f(E)}{\\max_{x\\in E}f(\\{x\\})}$ satisfies $1 \\leq \\ell_f \\leq\n|E|$. Thus our result improves upon the best known bound of $2-\\frac{2}{1+|E|}$\nby Iwata, Tetali, and Tripathi [ITT2012]. This leads to a\n$2-\\frac{1+r(E)}{1+|E|}$ approximation for the matroid MLOP, corresponding to\nthe case when $r$ is the rank function of a given matroid. Finally, we show\nthat MLVC can be $4/3$ approximated, matching the integrality gap of its\nvanilla LP relaxation.",

    "abstract": "Exploratory search starts with ill-defined goals and involves browsing,\nlearning, and formulating new targets for search. To fluidly support such\ndynamic search behaviours, we focus on devising interactive visual facets\n(IVF), visualising information facets to support user comprehension and control\nof the information space. To do this, we reviewed existing faceted search\ninterfaces and derived two design requirements (DR) that have not been fully\naddressed to support fluid interactions in exploratory search. We then\nexemplified the requirements through devising an IVF tool, which coordinates a\nlinear and a categorical facet representing the distribution and summarisation\nof items, respectively, and providing context for faceted exploration (DR1). To\nsupport rapid transitions between search criteria (DR2), the tool introduces a\nnovel design concept of using facets to select items without filtering the item\nspace. Particularly, we propose a filter-swipe technique that enables users to\ndrag a categorical facet value sequentially over linear facet bars to view the\nitems in the intersection of the two facets along with the categorical facet\ndynamically summarizing the items in the interaction. Three applications\ndemonstrate how the features support information discovery with ease. A user\nstudy of 11 participants with realistic email search tasks shows that dynamic\nsuggestions through the timeline navigation can help discover useful\nsuggestions for search; the novel design concept was favoured over using facet\nvalues as filters. Based on these practices, we derive IVF design implications\nfor fluid, exploratory searches.",

The use of digital\ntechnologies has been seen as an important effort to combat the pandemic and\none of such technologies is contact tracing applications. These applications\nwere successfully employed to face other infectious diseases, thus they have\nbeen used during the current pandemic. However, the use of contact tracing\nposes several privacy concerns since it is necessary to store and process data\nwhich can lead to the user/device identification as well as location and\nbehavior tracking. These concerns are even more relevant when considering\nnationwide implementations since they can lead to mass surveillance by\nauthoritarian governments. Despite the restrictions imposed by data protection\nlaws from several countries, there are still doubts on the preservation of the\nprivacy of the users. In this article, we analyze the privacy features in\nnational contact tracing COVID-19 applications considering their intrinsic\ncharacteristics. As a case study, we discuss in more depth the Brazilian\nCOVID-19 application Coronav\\'irus-SUS, since Brazil is one of the most\nimpacted countries by the current pandemic.

    "abstract": "Air traffic management (ATM) of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (AVs)\nrelies critically on ubiquitous location tracking. While technologies exist for\nAVs to broadcast their location periodically and for airports to track and\ndetect AVs, methods to verify the broadcast locations and complement the ATM\ncoverage are urgently needed, addressing anti-spoofing and safe coexistence\nconcerns. In this work, we propose an ATM solution by exploiting noncoherent\ncrowdsourced wireless networks (CWNs) and correcting the inherent\nclock-synchronization problems present in such non-coordinated sensor networks.\nWhile CWNs can provide a great number of measurements for ubiquitous ATM, these\nare normally obtained from unsynchronized sensors. This article first presents\nan analysis of the effects of lack of clock synchronization in ATM with CWN and\nprovides solutions based on the presence of few trustworthy sensors in a large\nnon-coordinated network. Secondly, autoregressive-based and long short-term\nmemory (LSTM)-based approaches are investigated to achieve the time\nsynchronization needed for localization of the AVs. Finally, a combination of a\nmultilateration (MLAT) method and a Kalman filter is employed to provide an\nanti-spoofing tracking solution for AVs. We demonstrate the performance\nadvantages of our framework through a dataset collected by a real-world CWN.\nOur results show that the proposed framework achieves localization accuracy\ncomparable to that acquired using only GPS-synchronized sensors and outperforms\nthe localization accuracy obtained based on state-of-the-art CWN\nsynchronization methods.",

    "title": "Exploring Lottery Ticket Hypothesis in Media Recommender Systems",
    "abstract": "Media recommender systems aim to capture users' preferences and provide\nprecise personalized recommendation of media content. There are two critical\ncomponents in the common paradigm of modern recommender models: (1)\nrepresentation learning, which generates an embedding for each user and item;\nand (2) interaction modeling, which fits user preferences towards items based\non their representations. Despite of great success, when a great amount of\nusers and items exist, it usually needs to create, store, and optimize a huge\nembedding table, where the scale of model parameters easily reach millions or\neven larger. Hence, it naturally raises questions about the heavy recommender\nmodels: Do we really need such large-scale parameters? We get inspirations from\nthe recently proposed lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH), which argues that the\ndense and over-parameterized model contains a much smaller and sparser\nsub-model that can reach comparable performance to the full model. In this\npaper, we extend LTH to media recommender systems, aiming to find the winning\ntickets in deep recommender models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work to study LTH in media recommender systems. With MF and LightGCN as\nthe backbone models, we found that there widely exist winning tickets in\nrecommender models. On three media convergence datasets -- Yelp2018, TikTok and\nKwai, the winning tickets can achieve comparable recommendation performance\nwith only 29%~48%, 7%~10% and 3%~17% of parameters, respectively.",

We show that\nthrough natural language prompts and a few minutes of training, our method can\nadapt a generator across a multitude of domains characterized by diverse styles\nand shapes. Notably, many of these modifications would be difficult or outright\nimpossible to reach with existing methods. We conduct an extensive set of\nexperiments and comparisons across a wide range of domains. These demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach and show that our shifted models maintain the\nlatent-space properties that make generative models appealing for downstream\ntasks.",

    "title": "Rethinking gradient sparsification as total error minimization",
    "abstract": "Gradient compression is a widely-established remedy to tackle the\ncommunication bottleneck in distributed training of large deep neural networks\n(DNNs). Under the error-feedback framework, Top-$k$ sparsification, sometimes\nwith $k$ as little as $0.1\\%$ of the gradient size, enables training to the\nsame model quality as the uncompressed case for a similar iteration count. From\nthe optimization perspective, we find that Top-$k$ is the communication-optimal\nsparsifier given a per-iteration $k$ element budget. We argue that to further\nthe benefits of gradient sparsification, especially for DNNs, a different\nperspective is necessary -- one that moves from per-iteration optimality to\nconsider optimality for the entire training.\nWe identify that the total error -- the sum of the compression errors for all\niterations -- encapsulates sparsification throughout training. Then, we propose\na communication complexity model that minimizes the total error under a\ncommunication budget for the entire training. We find that the hard-threshold\nsparsifier, a variant of the Top-$k$ sparsifier with $k$ determined by a\nconstant hard-threshold, is the optimal sparsifier for this model. Motivated by\nthis, we provide convex and non-convex convergence analyses for the\nhard-threshold sparsifier with error-feedback. Unlike with Top-$k$ sparsifier,\nwe show that hard-threshold has the same asymptotic convergence and linear\nspeedup property as SGD in the convex case and has no impact on the\ndata-heterogeneity in the non-convex case. Our diverse experiments on various\nDNNs and a logistic regression model demonstrated that the hard-threshold\nsparsifier is more communication-efficient than Top-$k$.",

    "abstract": "For a global breeding organization, identifying the next generation of\nsuperior crops is vital for its success. Recognizing new genetic varieties\nrequires years of in-field testing to gather data about the crop's yield, pest\nresistance, heat resistance, etc. At the conclusion of the growing season,\norganizations need to determine which varieties will be advanced to the next\ngrowing season (or sold to farmers) and which ones will be discarded from the\ncandidate pool. Specifically for soybeans, identifying their relative maturity\nis a vital piece of information used for advancement decisions. However, this\ntrait needs to be physically observed, and there are resource limitations\n(time, money, etc.) that bottleneck the data collection process. To combat\nthis, breeding organizations are moving toward advanced image capturing\ndevices. In this paper, we develop a robust and automatic approach for\nestimating the relative maturity of soybeans using a time series of UAV images.\nAn end-to-end hybrid model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed to extract features and capture the\nsequential behavior of time series data. The proposed deep learning model was\ntested on six different environments across the United States. Results suggest\nthe effectiveness of our proposed CNN-LSTM model compared to the local\nregression method. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this newfound information\ncan be used to aid in plant breeding advancement decisions.",

In this way, we find the model can quickly\nadapt to few-shot relationships using only a handful of known facts with\ninductive settings.

    "title": "Scope-Bounded Reachability in Valence Systems",
    "abstract": "Multi-pushdown systems are a standard model for concurrent recursive\nprograms, but they have an undecidable reachability problem. Therefore, there\nhave been several proposals to underapproximate their sets of runs so that\nreachability in this underapproximation becomes decidable. One such\nunderapproximation that covers a relatively high portion of runs is scope\nboundedness. In such a run, after each push to stack $i$, the corresponding pop\noperation must come within a bounded number of visits to stack $i$. In this\nwork, we generalize this approach to a large class of infinite-state systems.\nFor this, we consider the model of valence systems, which consist of a\nfinite-state control and an infinite-state storage mechanism that is specified\nby a finite undirected graph. This framework captures pushdowns, vector\naddition systems, integer vector addition systems, and combinations thereof.\nFor this framework, we propose a notion of scope boundedness that coincides\nwith the classical notion when the storage mechanism happens to be a\nmulti-pushdown. We show that with this notion, reachability can be decided in\nPSPACE for every storage mechanism in the framework. Moreover, we describe the\nfull complexity landscape of this problem across all storage mechanisms, both\nin the case of (i) the scope bound being given as input and (ii) for fixed\nscope bounds.\nFinally, we provide an almost complete description of the complexity\nlandscape if even a description of the storage mechanism is part of the input.",

When sampling methods such as MCMC or rejection\nsampling are used to implement a mechanism, the runtime can leak privacy. We\ncharacterize the additional privacy cost due to the runtime of a rejection\nsampler in terms of both $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP as well as $f$-DP. We also show\nthat unless the acceptance probability is constant across databases, the\nruntime of a rejection sampler does not satisfy $\\epsilon$-DP for any\n$\\epsilon$. We show that there is a similar breakdown in privacy with adaptive\nrejection samplers. We propose three modifications to the rejection sampling\nalgorithm, with varying assumptions, to protect against timing attacks by\nmaking the runtime independent of the data. The modification with the weakest\nassumptions is an approximate sampler, introducing a small increase in the\nprivacy cost, whereas the other modifications give perfect samplers. We also\nuse our techniques to develop an adaptive rejection sampler for log-H\\\"{o}lder\ndensities, which also has data-independent runtime.

We propose a new human-machine interface to drive\nbilateral ankle exoskeletons during a range of 'unseen' walking conditions that\nwere not used for establishing the control interface. The proposed approach\nuses person-specific neuromechanical models of the human body to estimate\nbiological ankle torques in real-time from electromyograms (EMGS) and joint\nangles. A low-level controller based on a disturbance observer translates\nbiological torque estimates into exoskeleton commands. We call this\n'neuromechanical model-based control' (NMBC). NMBC enabled five individuals to\nvoluntarily control exoskeletons across two walking speeds performed at three\nground elevations with no need for predefined torque profiles, nor a prior\nchosen neuromuscular reflex rules, or state machines as common in literature.\nFurthermore, a single subject case study was carried out on a dexterous\nmoonwalk task, showing reduction in muscular effort. NMBC enabled reducing\nbiological ankle torques as well as eight ankle muscle EMGs both within (22%\nfor the torque; 13% for the EMG) and between walking conditions (22% for the\ntorque; 13% for the EMG) when compared to non-assisted conditions. Torque and\nEMG reduction in novel walking conditions indicated the exoskeleton operated\nsymbiotically as an exomuscle controlled by the operator's neuromuscular\nsystem.

    "abstract": "The recent Covid-19 pandemic and the fact that wearing masks in public is now\nmandatory in several countries, created challenges in the use of face\nrecognition systems (FRS). In this work, we address the challenge of masked\nface recognition (MFR) and focus on evaluating the verification performance in\nFRS when verifying masked vs unmasked faces compared to verifying only unmasked\nfaces. We propose a methodology that combines the traditional triplet loss and\nthe mean squared error (MSE) intending to improve the robustness of an MFR\nsystem in the masked-unmasked comparison mode. The results obtained by our\nproposed method show improvements in a detailed step-wise ablation study. The\nconducted study showed significant performance gains induced by our proposed\ntraining paradigm and modified triplet loss on two evaluation databases.",

    "abstract": "Robots are being designed to communicate with people in various public and\ndomestic venues in a helpful, discreet way. Here, we use a speculative approach\nto shine light on a new concept of robot steganography (RS), that a robot could\nseek to help vulnerable populations by discreetly warning of potential threats.\nWe first identify some potentially useful scenarios for RS related to safety\nand security -- concerns that are estimated to cost the world trillions of\ndollars each year -- with a focus on two kinds of robots, an autonomous vehicle\n(AV) and a socially assistive humanoid robot (SAR). Next, we propose that\nexisting, powerful, computer-based steganography (CS) approaches can be adopted\nwith little effort in new contexts (SARs), while also pointing out potential\nbenefits of human-like steganography (HS): although less efficient and robust\nthan CS, HS represents a currently-unused form of RS that could also be used to\navoid requiring computers or detection by more technically advanced\nadversaries. This analysis also introduces some unique challenges of RS that\narise from message generation, indirect perception, and effects of perspective.\nFor this, we explore some related theoretical and practical concerns for\nselecting carrier signals and generating messages, also making available some\ncode and a video demo. Finally, we report on checking the current feasibility\nof the RS concept via a simplified user study, confirming that messages can be\nhidden in a robot's behaviors. The immediate implication is that RS could help\nto improve people's lives and mitigate some costly problems -- suggesting the\nusefulness of further discussion, ideation, and consideration by designers.",

Efficient classification of wood points and leaf\npoints is essential to study tree structural parameters and ecological\ncharacteristics. By using both the intensity and spatial information, a\nthree-step classification and verification method was proposed to achieve\nautomated wood-leaf classification. Tree point cloud was classified into wood\npoints and leaf points by using intensity threshold, neighborhood density and\nvoxelization successively. Experiment was carried in Haidian Park, Beijing, and\n24 trees were scanned by using the RIEGL VZ-400 scanner. The tree point clouds\nwere processed by using the proposed method, whose classification results were\ncompared with the manual classification results which were used as standard\nresults. To evaluate the classification accuracy, three indicators were used in\nthe experiment, which are Overall Accuracy (OA), Kappa coefficient (Kappa) and\nMatthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The ranges of OA, Kappa and MCC of the\nproposed method are from 0.9167 to 0.9872, from 0.7276 to 0.9191, and from\n0.7544 to 0.9211 respectively.

    "abstract": "The field of Continual Learning (CL) seeks to develop algorithms that\naccumulate knowledge and skills over time through interaction with\nnon-stationary environments and data distributions. Measuring progress in CL\ncan be difficult because a plethora of evaluation procedures (\\emph{settings})\nand algorithmic solutions (\\emph{methods}) have emerged, each with their own\npotentially disjoint set of assumptions about the CL problem. In this work, we\nview each setting as a set of \\emph{assumptions}. We then create a tree-shaped\nhierarchy of the research settings in CL, in which more general settings become\nthe parents of those with more restrictive assumptions. This makes it possible\nto use inheritance to share and reuse research, as developing a method for a\ngiven setting also makes it directly applicable onto any of its children. We\ninstantiate this idea as a publicly available software framework called\n\\emph{Sequoia}, which features a variety of settings from both the Continual\nSupervised Learning (CSL) and Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) domains.\nSequoia also includes a growing suite of methods which are easy to extend and\ncustomize, in addition to more specialized methods from third-party libraries.\nWe hope that this new paradigm and its first implementation can serve as a\nfoundation for the unification and acceleration of research in CL.

The turnaround time has a significant impact\nin terms of marketability and value creation potential of an aircraft and, for\nthis reason, it should be considered as an important driver of fuselage and\ncabin design decisions. Estimating the turnaround time during the early stages\nof aircraft design is therefore an essential task. This task becomes even more\ndecisive when designers explore unconventional aircraft architectures or, in\ngeneral, are still evaluating the fuselage design and its internal layout. In\nparticular, it is of paramount importance to properly estimate the boarding and\ndeboarding times, which contribute for up the 40% to the overall turnaround\ntime. For this purpose, a tool, called SimBaD, has been developed and validated\nwith publicly available data for existing aircraft of different classes. In\norder to demonstrate SimBaD capability of evaluating the influence of fuselage\nand cabin features on the turnaround time, its application to an unconventional\nbox-wing aircraft architecture, known as PrandtlPlane, is presented as case\nstudy. Finally, considering standard scenarios provided by aircraft\nmanufacturers, a comparison between the turnaround time of the PrandtlPlane and\nthe turnaround time of a conventional competitor aircraft is presented.",

An understanding\nof the relationships between SA and SC is expected to bridge the gap between SA\nand SC for supporting maintenance and evolution of software systems. Objective:\nWe aimed at exploring practitioners' understanding about the relationships\nbetween SA and SC. Method: We used a mixed-method that combines an online\nsurvey with 87 respondents and an interview with 8 participants to collect the\nviews of practitioners from 37 countries about the relationships between SA and\nSC. Results: Our results reveal that: practitioners mainly discuss five\nfeatures of relationships between SA and SC; a few practitioners have adopted\ndedicated approaches and tools in the literature for identifying and analyzing\nthe relationships between SA and SC despite recognizing the importance of such\ninformation for improving a system's quality attributes, especially\nmaintainability and reliability. It is felt that cost and effort are the major\nimpediments that prevent practitioners from identifying, analyzing, and using\nthe relationships between SA and SC. Conclusions: The results have empirically\nidentified five features of relationships between SA and SC reported in the\nliterature from the perspective of practitioners and a systematic framework to\nmanage the five features of relationships should be developed with dedicated\napproaches and tools considering the cost and benefit of maintaining the\nrelationships.",

    "abstract": "One of the most important problems in the field of pattern recognition is\ndata classification. Due to the increasing development of technologies\nintroduced in the field of data classification, some of the solutions are still\nopen and need more research. One of the challenging problems in this area is\nthe curse of dimensionality of the feature set of the data classification\nproblem. In solving the data classification problems, when the feature set is\ntoo large, typical approaches will not be able to solve the problem. In this\ncase, an approach can be used to partition the feature set into multiple\nfeature sub-sets so that the data classification problem is solved for each of\nthe feature subsets and finally using the ensemble classification, the\nclassification is applied to the entire feature set. In the above-mentioned\napproach, the partitioning of feature set into feature sub-sets is still an\ninteresting area in the literature of this field. In this research, an\ninnovative framework for multi-view ensemble classification, inspired by the\nproblem of object recognition in the multiple views theory of humans, is\nproposed. In this method, at first, the collaboration values between the\nfeatures is calculated using a criterion called the features collaboration\ncriterion. Then, the collaboration graph is formed based on the calculated\ncollaboration values. In the next step, using the community detection method,\ngraph communities are found. The communities are considered as the problem\nviews and the different base classifiers are trained for different views using\nthe views corresponding training data. The multi-view ensemble classifier is\nthen formed by a combination of base classifiers based on the AdaBoost\nalgorithm.

However,\nlimited by large model and computation complexity, GCNs for action recognition\nlike 2s-AGCN have insufficient power-efficiency and throughput on GPU. Thus,\nthe demand of model reduction and hardware acceleration for low-power GCNs\naction recognition application becomes continuously higher.\nTo address challenges above, this paper proposes a runtime sparse feature\ncompress accelerator with hybrid pruning method: RFC-HyPGCN. First, this method\nskips both graph and spatial convolution workloads by reorganizing the\nmultiplication order. Following spatial convolution workloads channel-pruning\ndataflow, a coarse-grained pruning method on temporal filters is designed,\ntogether with sampling-like fine-grained pruning on time dimension. Later, we\ncome up with an architecture where all convolutional layers are mapped on chip\nto pursue high throughput. To further reduce storage resource utilization,\nonline sparse feature compress format is put forward. Features are divided and\nencoded into several banks according to presented format, then bank storage is\nsplit into depth-variable mini-banks. Furthermore, this work applies\nquantization, input-skipping and intra-PE dynamic data scheduling to accelerate\nthe model. In experiments, proposed pruning method is conducted on 2s-AGCN,\nacquiring 3.0x-8.4x model compression ratio and 73.20\\% graph-skipping\nefficiency with balancing weight pruning. Implemented on Xilinx XCKU-115 FPGA,\nthe proposed architecture has the peak performance of 1142 GOP/s and achieves\nup to 9.19x and 3.91x speedup over high-end GPU NVIDIA 2080Ti and NVIDIA V100,\nrespectively. Compared with latest accelerator for action recognition GCNs\nmodels, our design reaches 22.9x speedup and 28.93\\% improvement on DSP\nefficiency.",

We use these annotations to train a BERT model with\nmultiple data augmentation strategies. Our augmented BERT model that combines\nboth expert and crowd annotations outperforms the baseline BERT classifier\ntrained with expert annotations only by over 25 points, from 58\\% macro-F1 to\nalmost 85\\%.

Our results show that\nsolidarity became increasingly salient and contested during the crisis.

That is,\ngiven an image, the goal is to automatically generate a sentence describing the\ncontext of the image with each noun word grounded to the corresponding region\nin the image. This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit fine-grained\nregion word alignments as supervision. Previous weakly supervised methods\nmainly explore various kinds of regularization schemes to improve attention\naccuracy. However, their performances are still far from the fully supervised\nones. One main issue that has been ignored is that the attention for generating\nvisually groundable words may only focus on the most discriminate parts and can\nnot cover the whole object. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective\nmethod to alleviate the issue, termed as partial grounding problem in our\npaper. Specifically, we design a distributed attention mechanism to enforce the\nnetwork to aggregate information from multiple spatially different regions with\nconsistent semantics while generating the words. Therefore, the union of the\nfocused region proposals should form a visual region that encloses the object\nof interest completely.

To find the answer,\nwe propose a new diagnostic tool -- Filter Attribution method based on Integral\nGradient (FAIG). Unlike previous integral gradient methods, our FAIG aims at\nfinding the most discriminative filters instead of input pixels/features for\ndegradation removal in blind SR networks. With the discovered filters, we\nfurther develop a simple yet effective method to predict the degradation of an\ninput image. Based on FAIG, we show that, in one-branch blind SR networks, 1)\nwe are able to find a very small number of (1%) discriminative filters for each\nspecific degradation; 2) The weights, locations and connections of the\ndiscovered filters are all important to determine the specific network\nfunction. 3) The task of degradation prediction can be implicitly realized by\nthese discriminative filters without explicit supervised learning.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development and evolution of sophisticated algorithms for\nstatistical analysis of time series data, the research community has started\nspending considerable effort in technical analysis of such data. Forecasting is\nalso an area which has witnessed a paradigm shift in its approach. In this\nwork, we have used the time series of the index values of the Auto sector in\nIndia during January 2010 to December 2015 for a deeper understanding of the\nbehavior of its three constituent components, e.g., the Trend, the Seasonal\ncomponent, and the Random component. Based on this structural analysis, we have\nalso designed three approaches for forecasting and also computed their accuracy\nin prediction using suitably chosen training and test data sets. The results\nclearly demonstrate the accuracy of our decomposition results and efficiency of\nour forecasting techniques, even in presence of a dominant Random component in\nthe time series.",

    "abstract": "A connected partition is a partition of the vertices of a graph into sets\nthat induce connected subgraphs. Such partitions naturally occur in many\napplication areas such as road networks, and image processing. We consider\nBalanced Connected Partitions (BCP), where the two classical objectives for BCP\nare to maximize the weight of the smallest, or minimize the weight of the\nlargest component. We study BCP on c-claw-free graphs, the class of graphs that\ndo not have $K_{1,c}$ as an induced subgraph, and present efficient\n(c-1)-approximation algorithms for both objectives. In particular, due to the\n(3-)claw-freeness of line graphs, this also implies a 2-approximations for the\nedge-partition version of BCP in general graphs.\nIn the 1970s Gy\\H{o}ri and Lov\\'{a}sz showed for natural numbers\n$w_1,\\dots,w_k$ where $\\sum_i w_i$ is the vertex size, that if $G$ is\nk-connected, then there exist a connected k-partition with part sizes\n$w_1,\\dots,w_k$. However, to this day no polynomial algorithm to compute such\npartitions exists for k>4. Towards finding such a partition $T_1,\\dots, T_k$,\nwe show how to efficiently compute connected partitions that at least\napproximately meet the target weights, subject to the mild assumption that each\n$w_i$ is greater than the weight of the heaviest vertex. In particular, we give\na 3-approximation for both the lower and the upper bounded version i.e. we\nguarantee that each $T_i$ has weight at least $\\frac{w_i}{3}$ or that each\n$T_i$ has weight most $3w_i$, respectively. Also, we present a both-side\nbounded version that produces a connected partition where each $T_i$ has size\nat least $\\frac{w_i}{3}$ and at most $\\max(\\{r,3\\}) w_i$, where $r \\geq 1$ is\nthe ratio between the largest and smallest value in $w_1, \\dots, w_k$. In\nparticular for the balanced version, i.e.~$w_1=w_2=, \\dots,=w_k$, this gives a\npartition with $\\frac{1}{3}w_i \\leq w(T_i) \\leq 3w_i$.",

The recent\nadvancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in computer vision as\nwell as in medical imaging may provide a basis for enhanced capabilities in\ncancer detection and analysis.

We provide a critical appraisal of the\nexisting literature of GANs applied to cancer imagery, together with\nsuggestions on future research directions to address these challenges. We\nanalyse and discuss 163 papers that apply adversarial training techniques in\nthe context of cancer imaging and elaborate their methodologies, advantages and\nlimitations.

This leads to unexpected\nfailures when noisy data is processed by an autonomous system. In this work, we\npropose a framework for robust autotuning of QD devices that combines a machine\nlearning (ML) state classifier with a data quality control module. The data\nquality control module acts as a ``gatekeeper'' system, ensuring that only\nreliable data is processed by the state classifier. Lower data quality results\nin either device recalibration or termination. To train both ML systems, we\nenhance the QD simulation by incorporating synthetic noise typical of QD\nexperiments. We confirm that the inclusion of synthetic noise in the training\nof the state classifier significantly improves the performance, resulting in an\naccuracy of 95.1(7) % when tested on experimental data. We then validate the\nfunctionality of the data quality control module by showing the state\nclassifier performance deteriorates with decreasing data quality, as expected.\nOur results establish a robust and flexible ML framework for autonomous tuning\nof noisy QD devices.",

In this paper, we introduce a\nsystem to efficiently reconstruct thermal images. Specifically, we explore how\nto effectively attend to contrasting receptive fields (RFs) where increasing\nthe RFs of a network can be computationally expensive. For this purpose, we\nintroduce a deep attention to varying receptive fields network (AVRFN). We\nsupply a gated convolutional layer with higher-order information extracted from\ndisparate RFs, whereby an RF is parameterized by a dilation rate. In this way,\nthe dilation rate can be tuned to use fewer parameters thus increasing the\nefficacy of AVRFN.

    "abstract": "Despite decades of practice, finite-size errors in many widely used\nelectronic structure theories for periodic systems remain poorly understood.\nFor periodic systems using a general Monkhorst-Pack grid, there has been no\nrigorous analysis of the finite-size error in the Hartree-Fock theory (HF) and\nthe second order M{\\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), which are the\nsimplest wavefunction based method, and the simplest post-Hartree-Fock method,\nrespectively. Such calculations can be viewed as a multi-dimensional integral\ndiscretized with certain trapezoidal rules. Due to the Coulomb singularity, the\nintegrand has many points of discontinuity in general, and standard error\nanalysis based on the Euler-Maclaurin formula gives overly pessimistic results.\nThe lack of analytic understanding of finite-size errors also impedes the\ndevelopment of effective finite-size correction schemes. We propose a unified\nmethod to obtain sharp convergence rates of finite-size errors for the periodic\nHF and MP2 theories. Our main technical advancement is a generalization of the\nresult of [Lyness, 1976] for obtaining sharp convergence rates of the\ntrapezoidal rule for a class of non-smooth integrands. Our result is applicable\nto three-dimensional bulk systems as well as low dimensional systems (such as\nnanowires and 2D materials). Our unified analysis also allows us to prove the\neffectiveness of the Madelung-constant correction to the Fock exchange energy,\nand the effectiveness of a recently proposed staggered mesh method for periodic\nMP2 calculations [Xing, Li, Lin, 2021]. Our analysis connects the effectiveness\nof the staggered mesh method with integrands with removable singularities, and\nsuggests a new staggered mesh method for reducing finite-size errors of\nperiodic HF calculations.",

    "title": "Provably Efficient Lottery Ticket Discovery",
    "abstract": "The lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) claims that randomly-initialized, dense\nneural networks contain (sparse) subnetworks that, when trained an equal amount\nin isolation, can match the dense network's performance. Although LTH is useful\nfor discovering efficient network architectures, its three-step process --\npre-training, pruning, and re-training -- is computationally expensive, as the\ndense model must be fully pre-trained. Luckily, \"early-bird\" tickets can be\ndiscovered within neural networks that are minimally pre-trained, allowing for\nthe creation of efficient, LTH-inspired training procedures. Yet, no\ntheoretical foundation of this phenomenon exists. We derive an analytical bound\nfor the number of pre-training iterations that must be performed for a winning\nticket to be discovered, thus providing a theoretical understanding of when and\nwhy such early-bird tickets exist. By adopting a greedy forward selection\npruning strategy, we directly connect the pruned network's performance to the\nloss of the dense network from which it was derived, revealing a threshold in\nthe number of pre-training iterations beyond which high-performing subnetworks\nare guaranteed to exist. We demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results\nacross a variety of architectures and datasets, including multi-layer\nperceptrons (MLPs) trained on MNIST and several deep convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) architectures trained on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.",

We show that\npath-lengths traversed in the manifold of thermodynamic states, measured in a\nsuitable Riemannian metric, represent dissipative losses, while area integrals\nof a work-density quantify work being extracted. Thus, the maximal amount of\nwork that can be extracted relates to an isoperimetric problem, trading off\narea against length of an encircling path. We derive an isoperimetric\ninequality that provides a universal bound on the efficiency of all cyclic\noperating protocols, and a bound on how fast a closed path can be traversed\nbefore it becomes impossible to extract positive work.

Channel estimation is exceptionally challenging in scenarios\nwhere NOMA schemes are integrated with millimeter wave (mmWave) massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. An accurate estimation of the\nchannel is essential in exploiting the benefits of the pairing of the duo-NOMA\nand mmWave.

Initially, users are grouped into different clusters based on\ntheir channel gains and beamforming technique is performed to maximize the\nsignal in the direction of desired cluster. A coarse estimation of the channel\nis first made from the received signal and this estimate is given as the input\nto CNN to fine estimate the channel coefficients.

Traditional network models normally use graph theory to\nconsider articles as nodes and citations as pairwise relationships between\nthem. In this paper, we propose an alternative evolutionary model based on\nhypergraph theory in which one hyperedge can have an arbitrary number of nodes,\ncombined with an aging effect to reflect the temporal dynamics of scientific\ncitation behavior. Both theoretical approximate solution and simulation\nanalysis of the model are developed and validated using two benchmark datasets\nfrom different disciplines, i.e. publications of the American Physical Society\n(APS) and the Digital Bibliography & Library Project (DBLP). Further analysis\nindicates that the attraction of early publications will decay exponentially.\nMoreover, the experimental results show that the aging effect indeed has a\nsignificant influence on the description of collective citation patterns.\nShedding light on the complex dynamics driving these mechanisms facilitates the\nunderstanding of the laws governing scientific evolution and the quantitative\nevaluation of scientific outputs.",

    "abstract": "The performance of deep segmentation models often degrades due to\ndistribution shifts in image intensities between the training and test data\nsets. This is particularly pronounced in multi-centre studies involving data\nacquired using multi-vendor scanners, with variations in acquisition protocols.\nIt is challenging to address this degradation because the shift is often not\nknown \\textit{a priori} and hence difficult to model. We propose a novel\nframework to ensure robust segmentation in the presence of such distribution\nshifts. Our contribution is three-fold. First, inspired by the spirit of\ncurriculum learning, we design a novel style curriculum to train the\nsegmentation models using an easy-to-hard mode. A style transfer model with\nstyle fusion is employed to generate the curriculum samples. Gradually focusing\non complex and adversarial style samples can significantly boost the robustness\nof the models. Second, instead of subjectively defining the curriculum\ncomplexity, we adopt an automated gradient manipulation method to control the\nhard and adversarial sample generation process. Third, we propose the Local\nGradient Sign strategy to aggregate the gradient locally and stabilise training\nduring gradient manipulation. The proposed framework can generalise to unknown\ndistribution without using any target data. Extensive experiments on the public\nM\\&Ms Challenge dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework can generalise\ndeep models well to unknown distributions and achieve significant improvements\nin segmentation accuracy.",

In practice,\nhowever, all Bell experiments rely on the precise understanding of the\nunderlying physical mechanisms. Given that, it is natural to ask: Can one\nwitness nonclassical behaviour in a truly black-box scenario? Here we propose\nand implement, computationally and experimentally, a solution to this ab-initio\ntask. It exploits a robust automated optimization approach based on the\nStochastic Nelder-Mead algorithm. Treating preparation and measurement devices\nas black-boxes, and relying on the observed statistics only, our adaptive\nprotocol approaches the optimal Bell inequality violation after a limited\nnumber of iterations for a variety photonic states, measurement responses and\nBell scenarios. In particular, we exploit it for randomness certification from\nunknown states and measurements.

    "abstract": "With increased wind power penetration in modern power systems, wind plants\nare required to provide frequency support similar to conventional plants.\nHowever, for the existing frequency regulation scheme of wind turbines, the\ncontrol gains in the auxiliary frequency controller are difficult to set\nbecause of the compromise of the frequency regulation performance and the\nstable operation of wind turbines, especially when the wind speed remains\nvariable. This paper proposes a novel frequency regulation scheme (FRS) for\nde-loaded wind turbines. Instead of an auxiliary frequency controller,\nfrequency support is provided by modifying the parametrized power versus rotor\nspeed curve, including the inertia power versus rotor speed curve and the droop\npower versus rotor speed curve. The advantage of the proposed scheme is that it\ndoes not contain any control gains and generally adapts to different wind\nspeeds. Further, the proposed scheme can work for the whole section of wind\nspeed without wind speed measurement information. The compared simulation\nresults demonstrate the scheme improves the system frequency response while\nensuring the stable operation of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs)-based\nvariable-speed wind turbines (VSWTs) under various wind conditions.\nFurthermore, the scheme prevents rotor speed overdeceleration even when the\nwind speed decreases during frequency regulation control.",

Chaotic\nsensing is one such methodology that employs deterministic, fractal sampling in\nconjunction with finite, iterative reconstruction schemes to form an image from\nlimited samples. Using a sampling pattern constructed entirely from periodic\nlines in DFT space, chaotic sensing was found to outperform traditional\ncompressed sensing for magnetic resonance imaging; however, only one such\nsampling pattern was presented and the reason for its fractal nature was not\nproven. Through the introduction of a novel image transform known as the\nkaleidoscope transform, which formalises and extends upon the concept of\ndownsampling and concatenating an image with itself, this paper: (1)\ndemonstrates a fundamental relationship between multiplication in modular\narithmetic and downsampling; (2) provides a rigorous mathematical explanation\nfor the fractal nature of the sampling pattern in the DFT; and (3) leverages\nthis understanding to develop a collection of novel fractal sampling patterns\nfor the 2D DFT with customisable properties. The ability to design tailor-made\nfractal sampling patterns expands the utility of the DFT in chaotic imaging and\nmay form the basis for a bespoke chaotic sensing methodology, in which the\nfractal sampling matches the imaging task for improved reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Based on a novel generalized second law of thermodynamics, we demonstrate\nthat feedback control enjoys more net-extractable work than the control without\nmeasurements. The generalized second law asserts that the total entropy\nproduction of a closed system is bounded below by correlation's dissipation,\nsimply named co-dissipation. Accordingly, co-dissipation is entropy production\nnot to be converted to work. For the control without measurement,\nco-dissipation is caused by the loss of internal correlations among subsystems.\nOn the other hand, because the feedback control can vanish the co-dissipation,\nit can extract work in principle from the internal correlation loss, which\nresults in its fundamental advantage. Moreover, the characteristics of\nco-dissipation are consistent with heat dissipation in terms of irreversible\nuseless entropy production. Hence, the generalized second law implies that the\nsystem's entropy production is bounded by the sum of two types of dissipation:\nheat and correlation. The generalized second law is derived by taking the sum\nof the entropy productions for all subsystems. We develop the technique for\nthis computation, where the entropy productions are summed in parallel with the\nsequence of the graphs representing the dependency among subsystems.\nFurthermore, the positivity of co-dissipation is guaranteed by a purely\ninformation-theoretic fact, the data processing inequality, which will possibly\nshed light on the relation between thermodynamics and information theory.",

Hence, understanding the fundamental\nlimits and the attainable performance of estimators of that signal inevitably\ncalls for the study of random tensors. Substantial progress has been achieved\non this subject thanks to recent efforts, under the assumption that the tensor\ndimensions grow large. Yet, some of the most significant among these\nresults--in particular, a precise characterization of the abrupt phase\ntransition (in terms of signal-to-noise ratio) that governs the performance of\nthe maximum likelihood (ML) estimator of a symmetric rank-one model with\nGaussian noise--were derived on the basis of statistical physics ideas, which\nare not easily accessible to non-experts.\nIn this work, we develop a sharply distinct approach, relying instead on\nstandard but powerful tools brought by years of advances in random matrix\ntheory. The key idea is to study the spectra of random matrices arising from\ncontractions of a given random tensor. We show how this gives access to\nspectral properties of the random tensor itself. In the specific case of a\nsymmetric rank-one model with Gaussian noise, our technique yields a hitherto\nunknown characterization of the local maximum of the ML problem that is global\nabove the phase transition threshold.

    "abstract": "Environmentally assisted cracking phenomena are widespread across the\ntransport, defence, energy and construction sectors. However, predicting\nenvironmentally assisted fractures is a highly cross-disciplinary endeavour\nthat requires resolving the multiple material-environment interactions taking\nplace. In this manuscript, an overview is given of recent breakthroughs in the\nmodelling of environmentally assisted cracking. The focus is on the\nopportunities created by two recent developments: phase field and multi-physics\nmodelling. The possibilities enabled by the confluence of phase field methods\nand electro-chemo-mechanics modelling are discussed in the context of three\nenvironmental assisted cracking phenomena of particular engineering interest:\nhydrogen embrittlement, localised corrosion and corrosion fatigue. Mechanical\nprocesses such as deformation and fracture can be coupled with chemical\nphenomena like local reactions, ionic transport and hydrogen uptake and\ndiffusion. Moreover, these can be combined with the prediction of an evolving\ninterface, such as a growing pit or a crack, as dictated by a phase field\nvariable that evolves based on thermodynamics and local kinetics. Suitable for\nboth microstructural and continuum length scales, this new generation of\nsimulation-based, multi-physics phase field models can open new modelling\nhorizons and enable Virtual Testing in harmful environments.",

Despite the\nscientific interest suggested by such assumptions, the relationships between\ndescriptive time series features (e.g., temporal dependence, entropy,\nseasonality, trend and nonlinearity features) and actual time series\nforecastability (quantified by issuing and assessing forecasts for the past)\nare scarcely studied and quantified in the literature. In this work, we aim to\nfill in this gap by investigating such relationships, and the way that they can\nbe exploited for understanding hydroclimatic forecastability. To this end, we\nfollow a systematic framework bringing together a variety of -- mostly new for\nhydrology -- concepts and methods, including 57 descriptive features. We apply\nthis framework to three global datasets. As these datasets comprise over 13 000\nmonthly temperature, precipitation and river flow time series from several\ncontinents and hydroclimatic regimes, they allow us to provide trustable\ncharacterizations and interpretations of 12-month ahead hydroclimatic\nforecastability at the global scale. We find that this forecastability in terms\nof Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency is strongly related to several descriptive\nfeatures. We further (i) show that, if such descriptive information is\navailable for a time series, we can even foretell the quality of its future\nforecasts with a considerable degree of confidence, and (ii) rank the features\naccording to their efficiency in inferring and foretelling forecastability.\nSpatial forecastability patterns are also revealed through our experiments.

    "abstract": "Lagrangian data assimilation of complex nonlinear turbulent flows is an\nimportant but computationally challenging topic. In this article, an efficient\ndata-driven statistically accurate reduced-order modeling algorithm is\ndeveloped that significantly accelerates the computational efficiency of\nLagrangian data assimilation. The algorithm starts with a Fourier transform of\nthe high-dimensional flow field, which is followed by an effective model\nreduction that retains only a small subset of the Fourier coefficients\ncorresponding to the energetic modes. Then a linear stochastic model is\ndeveloped to approximate the nonlinear dynamics of each Fourier coefficient.\nEffective additive and multiplicative noise processes are incorporated to\ncharacterize the modes that exhibit Gaussian and non-Gaussian statistics,\nrespectively. All the parameters in the reduced order system, including the\nmultiplicative noise coefficients, are determined systematically via closed\nanalytic formulae. These linear stochastic models succeed in forecasting the\nuncertainty and facilitate an extremely rapid data assimilation scheme. The new\nLagrangian data assimilation is then applied to observations of sea ice floe\ntrajectories that are driven by atmospheric winds and turbulent ocean currents.\nIt is shown that observing only about $30$ non-interacting floes in a\n$200$km$\\times200$km domain is sufficient to recover the key multi-scale\nfeatures of the ocean currents. The additional observations of the floe angular\ndisplacements are found to be suitable supplements to the center-of-mass\npositions for improving the data assimilation skill. In addition, the observed\nlarge and small floes are more useful in recovering the large- and small-scale\nfeatures of the ocean, respectively. The Fourier domain data assimilation also\nsucceeds in recovering the ocean features in the areas where cloud cover\nobscures the observations.",

    "abstract": "The growth of wind generation capacities in the past decades has shown that\nwind energy can contribute to the energy transition in many parts of the world.\nBeing highly variable and complex to model, the quantification of the\nspatio-temporal variation of wind power and the related uncertainty is highly\nrelevant for energy planners. Machine Learning has become a popular tool to\nperform wind-speed and power predictions. However, the existing approaches have\nseveral limitations. These include (i) insufficient consideration of\nspatio-temporal correlations in wind-speed data, (ii) a lack of existing\nmethodologies to quantify the uncertainty of wind speed prediction and its\npropagation to the wind-power estimation, and (iii) a focus on less than hourly\nfrequencies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a framework to\nreconstruct a spatio-temporal field on a regular grid from irregularly\ndistributed wind-speed measurements. After decomposing data into temporally\nreferenced basis functions and their corresponding spatially distributed\ncoefficients, the latter are spatially modelled using Extreme Learning\nMachines. Estimates of both model and prediction uncertainties, and of their\npropagation after the transformation of wind speed into wind power, are then\nprovided without any assumptions on distribution patterns of the data. The\nmethodology is applied to the study of hourly wind power potential on a grid of\n$250\\times 250$ m$^2$ for turbines of 100 meters hub height in Switzerland,\ngenerating the first dataset of its type for the country. The potential wind\npower generation is combined with the available area for wind turbine\ninstallations to yield an estimate of the technical potential for wind power in\nSwitzerland. The wind power estimate presented here represents an important\ninput for planners to support the design of future energy systems with\nincreased wind power generation.",

This\npaper proposes a manifold learning framework to classify two types of EEG data\nfrom motor imagery (MI) tasks by discovering lower dimensional geometric\nstructures. For feature extraction, it is implemented by Common Spatial Pattern\n(CSP) from the preprocessed EEG signals. In the neighborhoods of the features\nfor classification, the local approximation to the support of the data is\nobtained, and then the features are assigned to the classes with the closest\nsupport. A spherical approximation (SPA) classifier is created using spherelets\nfor local approximation, and the extracted features are classified with this\nmanifold-based method. The SPA classifier achieves high accuracy in the 2008\nBCI competition data, and the analysis shows that this method can significantly\nimprove the decoding accuracy of MI tasks and exhibit strong robustness for\nsmall sample datasets.

The impact of this interdependence on the tendency to adopt less\nor more restrictive measures is hard to evaluate, more so if diversity in\neconomic exposures to citizens' mobility are considered. Here, we address this\nproblem by developing an analytical and computational game-theoretical model\nencompassing the conflicts arising from the need to control the economic\neffects of global risks, such as in the COVID-19 pandemic. The model includes\nthe individual costs derived from severe restrictions imposed by governments,\nincluding the resulting economic interdependence among all the parties involved\nin the game. By using tourism-based data, the model is enriched with actual\nheterogeneous income losses, such that every player has a different economic\ncost when applying restrictions. We show that economic interdependence enhances\ncooperation because of the decline in the expected payoffs by free-riding\nparties (i.e., those neglecting the application of mobility restrictions).\nFurthermore, we show (analytically and through numerical simulations) that\nthese cross-exposures can transform the nature of the cooperation dilemma each\nregion or country faces, modifying the position of the fixed points and the\nsize of the basins of attraction that characterize this class of games.\nFinally, our results suggest that heterogeneity among regions may be used to\nleverage the impact of intervention policies by ensuring an agreement among the\nmost relevant initial set of cooperators.",

State-of-the-art\nmulti-phase LiTS methods usually fused cross-phase features through\nphase-weighted summation or channel-attention based concatenation. However,\nthese methods ignored the spatial (pixel-wise) relationships between different\nphases, hence leading to insufficient feature integration. In addition, the\nperformance of existing methods remains subject to the uncertainty in\nsegmentation, which is particularly acute in tumor boundary regions. In this\nwork, we propose a novel LiTS method to adequately aggregate multi-phase\ninformation and refine uncertain region segmentation. To this end, we introduce\na spatial aggregation module (SAM), which encourages per-pixel interactions\nbetween different phases, to make full use of cross-phase information.\nMoreover, we devise an uncertain region inpainting module (URIM) to refine\nuncertain pixels using neighboring discriminative features. Experiments on an\nin-house multi-phase CT dataset of focal liver lesions (MPCT-FLLs) demonstrate\nthat our method achieves promising liver tumor segmentation and outperforms\nstate-of-the-arts.",

    "abstract": "We present an iVector based Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) system suited\nfor real life settings where active foreground speech can be present. In the\nproposed system, each recording is represented by a fixed-length iVector that\nmodels the recording's important properties. A regularized Gaussian backend\nclassifier with class-specific covariance models is used to extract the\nrelevant acoustic scene information from these iVectors. To alleviate the large\nperformance degradation when a foreground speaker dominates the captured\nsignal, we investigate the use of the iVector framework on Mel-Frequency\nCepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) that are derived from an estimate of the noise\npower spectral density. This noise-floor can be extracted in a statistical\nmanner for single channel recordings. We show that the use of noise-floor\nfeatures is complementary to multi-condition training in which foreground\nspeech is added to training signal to reduce the mismatch between training and\ntesting conditions. Experimental results on the DCASE 2016 Task 1 dataset show\nthat the noise-floor based features and multi-condition training realize\nsignificant classification accuracy gains of up to more than 25 percentage\npoints (absolute) in the most adverse conditions. These promising results can\nfurther facilitate the integration of ASC in resource-constrained devices such\nas hearables.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive predictive coding (CPC) aims to learn representations of speech\nby distinguishing future observations from a set of negative examples. Previous\nwork has shown that linear classifiers trained on CPC features can accurately\npredict speaker and phone labels. However, it is unclear how the features\nactually capture speaker and phonetic information, and whether it is possible\nto normalize out the irrelevant details (depending on the downstream task). In\nthis paper, we first show that the per-utterance mean of CPC features captures\nspeaker information to a large extent. Concretely, we find that comparing means\nperforms well on a speaker verification task. Next, probing experiments show\nthat standardizing the features effectively removes speaker information. Based\non this observation, we propose a speaker normalization step to improve\nacoustic unit discovery using K-means clustering of CPC features. Finally, we\nshow that a language model trained on the resulting units achieves some of the\nbest results in the ZeroSpeech2021~Challenge.",

    "abstract": "Efficient methods for the representation of relevant quantum states and\nquantum operations are crucial for the simulation and optimization of quantum\ncircuits. Decision diagrams (DDs), a well-studied data structure originally\nused to represent Boolean functions, have proven capable of capturing\ninteresting aspects of quantum systems, but their limits are not well\nunderstood. In this work, we investigate and bridge the gap between existing\nDD-based structures and the stabilizer formalism, a well-studied method for\nsimulating quantum circuits in the tractable regime. We first show that\nalthough DDs were suggested to succinctly represent important quantum states,\nthey actually require exponential space for a subset of stabilizer states. To\nremedy this, we introduce a more powerful decision diagram variant, called\nLocal Invertible Map-DD (LIMDD). We prove that the set of quantum states\nrepresented by poly-sized LIMDDs strictly contains the union of stabilizer\nstates and other decision diagram variants. We also provide evidence that\nLIMDD-based simulation is capable of efficiently simulating some circuits for\nwhich both stabilizer-based and other DD-based methods require exponential\ntime. By uniting two successful approaches, LIMDDs thus pave the way for\nfundamentally more powerful solutions for simulation and analysis of quantum\ncomputing.",

Quantum machine learning for real-world data has to handle\nextensive amounts of high-dimensional data. However, conventional methods for\nmeasuring quantum kernels are impractical for large datasets as they scale with\nthe square of the dataset size. Here, we measure quantum kernels using\nrandomized measurements to gain a quadratic speedup in computation time and\nquickly process large datasets. Further, we efficiently encode high-dimensional\ndata into quantum computers with the number of features scaling linearly with\nthe circuit depth. The encoding is characterized by the quantum Fisher\ninformation metric and is related to the radial basis function kernel. We\ndemonstrate the advantages and speedups of our methods by classifying images\nwith the IBM quantum computer. Our approach is exceptionally robust to noise\nvia a complementary error mitigation scheme.
