    "abstract": "The generalization error of a classifier is related to the complexity of the\nset of functions among which the classifier is chosen. Roughly speaking, the\nmore complex the family, the greater the potential disparity between the\ntraining error and the population error of the classifier. This principle is\nembodied in layman's terms by Occam's razor principle, which suggests favoring\nlow-complexity hypotheses over complex ones. We study a family of\nlow-complexity classifiers consisting of thresholding the one-dimensional\nfeature obtained by projecting the data on a random line after embedding it\ninto a higher dimensional space parametrized by monomials of order up to k.\nMore specifically, the extended data is projected n-times and the best\nclassifier among those n (based on its performance on training data) is chosen.\nWe obtain a bound on the generalization error of these low-complexity\nclassifiers. The bound is less than that of any classifier with a non-trivial\nVC dimension, and thus less than that of a linear classifier. We also show\nthat, given full knowledge of the class conditional densities, the error of the\nclassifiers would converge to the optimal (Bayes) error as k and n go to\ninfinity; if only a training dataset is given, we show that the classifiers\nwill perfectly classify all the training points as k and n go to infinity.",

    "abstract": "A common tool used by security professionals for reverse-engineering binaries\nfound in the wild is the decompiler. A decompiler attempts to reverse\ncompilation, transforming a binary to a higher-level language such as C.\nHigh-level languages ease reasoning about programs by providing useful\nabstractions such as loops, typed variables, and comments, but these\nabstractions are lost during compilation. Decompilers are able to\ndeterministically reconstruct structural properties of code, but comments,\nvariable names, and custom variable types are technically impossible to\nrecover.\nIn this paper we present DIRTY (DecompIled variable ReTYper), a novel\ntechnique for improving the quality of decompiler output that automatically\ngenerates meaningful variable names and types. Empirical evaluation on a novel\ndataset of C code mined from GitHub shows that DIRTY outperforms prior work\napproaches by a sizable margin, recovering the original names written by\ndevelopers 66.4% of the time and the original types 75.8% of the time.",

    "abstract": "Many scientific conferences employ a two-phase paper review process, where\nsome papers are assigned additional reviewers after the initial reviews are\nsubmitted. Many conferences also design and run experiments on their paper\nreview process, where some papers are assigned reviewers who provide reviews\nunder an experimental condition. In this paper, we consider the question: how\nshould reviewers be divided between phases or conditions in order to maximize\ntotal assignment similarity? We make several contributions towards answering\nthis question. First, we prove that when the set of papers requiring additional\nreview is unknown, a simplified variant of this problem is NP-hard. Second, we\nempirically show that across several datasets pertaining to real conference\ndata, dividing reviewers between phases/conditions uniformly at random allows\nan assignment that is nearly as good as the oracle optimal assignment. This\nuniformly random choice is practical for both the two-phase and conference\nexperiment design settings. Third, we provide explanations of this phenomenon\nby providing theoretical bounds on the suboptimality of this random strategy\nunder certain natural conditions. From these easily-interpretable conditions,\nwe provide actionable insights to conference program chairs about whether a\nrandom reviewer split is suitable for their conference.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent vehicles clearly benefit from the expanded Field of View (FoV) of\nthe 360-degree sensors, but the vast majority of available semantic\nsegmentation training images are captured with pinhole cameras. In this work,\nwe look at this problem through the lens of domain adaptation and bring\npanoramic semantic segmentation to a setting, where labelled training data\noriginates from a different distribution of conventional pinhole camera images.\nFirst, we formalize the task of unsupervised domain adaptation for panoramic\nsemantic segmentation, where a network trained on labelled examples from the\nsource domain of pinhole camera data is deployed in a different target domain\nof panoramic images, for which no labels are available. To validate this idea,\nwe collect and publicly release DensePASS - a novel densely annotated dataset\nfor panoramic segmentation under cross-domain conditions, specifically built to\nstudy the Pinhole-to-Panoramic transfer and accompanied with pinhole camera\ntraining examples obtained from Cityscapes. DensePASS covers both, labelled-\nand unlabelled 360-degree images, with the labelled data comprising 19 classes\nwhich explicitly fit the categories available in the source domain (i.e.\npinhole) data. To meet the challenge of domain shift, we leverage the current\nprogress of attention-based mechanisms and build a generic framework for\ncross-domain panoramic semantic segmentation based on different variants of\nattention-augmented domain adaptation modules. Our framework facilitates\ninformation exchange at local- and global levels when learning the domain\ncorrespondences and improves the domain adaptation performance of two standard\nsegmentation networks by 6.05% and 11.26% in Mean IoU.",

These two-stage detectors improve with the accuracy of\nthe intermediate depth estimation network, which can itself be improved without\nmanual labels via large-scale self-supervised learning. However, they tend to\nsuffer from overfitting more than end-to-end methods, are more complex, and the\ngap with similar lidar-based detectors remains significant. In this work, we\npropose an end-to-end, single stage, monocular 3D object detector, DD3D, that\ncan benefit from depth pre-training like pseudo-lidar methods, but without\ntheir limitations. Our architecture is designed for effective information\ntransfer between depth estimation and 3D detection, allowing us to scale with\nthe amount of unlabeled pre-training data.

    "abstract": "This paper describes Georeference Contrastive Learning of visual\nRepresentation (GeoCLR) for efficient training of deep-learning Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs). The method leverages georeference information by\ngenerating a similar image pair using images taken of nearby locations, and\ncontrasting these with an image pair that is far apart. The underlying\nassumption is that images gathered within a close distance are more likely to\nhave similar visual appearance, where this can be reasonably satisfied in\nseafloor robotic imaging applications where image footprints are limited to\nedge lengths of a few metres and are taken so that they overlap along a\nvehicle's trajectory, whereas seafloor substrates and habitats have patch sizes\nthat are far larger. A key advantage of this method is that it is\nself-supervised and does not require any human input for CNN training. The\nmethod is computationally efficient, where results can be generated between\ndives during multi-day AUV missions using computational resources that would be\naccessible during most oceanic field trials. We apply GeoCLR to habitat\nclassification on a dataset that consists of ~86k images gathered using an\nAutonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We demonstrate how the latent\nrepresentations generated by GeoCLR can be used to efficiently guide human\nannotation efforts, where the semi-supervised framework improves classification\naccuracy by an average of 11.8 % compared to state-of-the-art transfer learning\nusing the same CNN and equivalent number of human annotations for training.",

The separate regression modules allow us to take full advantage of\ntheir state-of-the-art performances without compromising the original accuracy\nand reliability in practice.

Recently, image translation models have been\nproposed to augment data across domains to create synthetic data points.

Researchers have proposed\ndifferent approaches for predicting cybersickness from bio-physiological data\n(e.g., heart rate, breathing rate, electroencephalogram). However, collecting\nbio-physiological data often requires external sensors, limiting locomotion and\n3D-object manipulation during the virtual reality (VR) experience.

    "abstract": "Video captioning targets interpreting the complex visual contents as text\ndescriptions, which requires the model to fully understand video scenes\nincluding objects and their interactions. Prevailing methods adopt\noff-the-shelf object detection networks to give object proposals and use the\nattention mechanism to model the relations between objects. They often miss\nsome undefined semantic concepts of the pretrained model and fail to identify\nexact predicate relationships between objects. In this paper, we investigate an\nopen research task of generating text descriptions for the given videos, and\npropose Cross-Modal Graph (CMG) with meta concepts for video captioning.\nSpecifically, to cover the useful semantic concepts in video captions, we\nweakly learn the corresponding visual regions for text descriptions, where the\nassociated visual regions and textual words are named cross-modal meta\nconcepts. We further build meta concept graphs dynamically with the learned\ncross-modal meta concepts. We also construct holistic video-level and local\nframe-level video graphs with the predicted predicates to model video sequence\nstructures. We validate the efficacy of our proposed techniques with extensive\nexperiments and achieve state-of-the-art results on two public datasets.",

    "abstract": "Privileged malware neutralizes software-based versioning systems and destroys\ndata. To counter this threat, a versioning solid-state drive (SSD) that\nperforms versioning inside the SSD has been studied. An SSD is a suitable\ncandidate for data versioning because it can preserve previous versions without\nadditional copying, and provide high security with a very small trusted\ncomputing base (TCB). However, the versioning SSDs studied so far commonly use\na full disk versioning method that preserves all file versions in a batch. This\npaper demonstrates that SSDs, which provide full disk versioning, can be\nexposed to data tampering attacks when the retention time of data is less than\nthe malware's dwell time. To deal with this threat, we propose SGX-SSD, a\npolicy-based per-file versioning SSD to keep a deeper history for only the\nimportant files of users. However, since the SSD isn't aware of a file\nsemantic, and the versioning policy information should be securely received\nfrom the untrusted host computer, implementing the per-file versioning in SSD\nis a huge challenge. To solve this problem, SGX-SSD utilizes the Intel SGX and\nhas a secure host interface to securely receive policy information\n(configuration values) from the user. Also, to solve the file semantic\nunawareness problem of the SSD, a piggyback module is designed to give a file\nhint at the host layer, and an algorithm for selective versioning based on the\npolicy is implemented in the SSD. To prove our system, we prototyped SGX-SSD\nthe Jasmine OpenSSD platform in Linux environment. In the experimental\nevaluation, we proved that SGX-SSD provides strong security with little\nadditional overhead for selective per-file versioning.",

    "abstract": "Registration of 3D anatomic structures to their 2D dual fluoroscopic X-ray\nimages is a widely used motion tracking technique. However, deep learning\nimplementation is often impeded by a paucity of medical images and ground\ntruths. In this study, we proposed a transfer learning strategy for 3D-to-2D\nregistration using deep neural networks trained from an artificial dataset.\nDigitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) and radiographic skull landmarks\nwere automatically created from craniocervical CT data of a female subject.\nThey were used to train a residual network (ResNet) for landmark detection and\na cycle generative adversarial network (GAN) to eliminate the style difference\nbetween DRRs and actual X-rays. Landmarks on the X-rays experiencing GAN style\ntranslation were detected by the ResNet, and were used in triangulation\noptimization for 3D-to-2D registration of the skull in actual dual-fluoroscope\nimages (with a non-orthogonal setup, point X-ray sources, image distortions,\nand partially captured skull regions). The registration accuracy was evaluated\nin multiple scenarios of craniocervical motions. In walking, learning-based\nregistration for the skull had angular/position errors of 3.9 +- 2.1 deg / 4.6\n+- 2.2 mm. However, the accuracy was lower during functional neck activity, due\nto overly small skull regions imaged on the dual fluoroscopic images at\nend-range positions. The methodology to strategically augment artificial\ntraining data can tackle the complicated skull registration scenario, and has\npotentials to extend to widespread registration scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Sequential Recommendationdescribes a set of techniques to model dynamic user\nbehavior in order to predict future interactions in sequential user data. At\ntheir core, such approaches model transition probabilities between items in a\nsequence, whether through Markov chains, recurrent networks, or more recently,\nTransformers. However both old and new issues remain, including data-sparsity\nand noisy data; such issues can impair the performance, especially in complex,\nparameter-hungry models. In this paper, we investigate the application of\ncontrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) to the sequential recommendation, as\na way to alleviate some of these issues. Contrastive SSL constructs\naugmentations from unlabelled instances, where agreements among positive pairs\nare maximized. It is challenging to devise a contrastive SSL framework for a\nsequential recommendation, due to its discrete nature, correlations among\nitems, and skewness of length distributions. To this end, we propose a novel\nframework, Contrastive Self-supervised Learning for sequential Recommendation\n(CoSeRec). We introduce two informative augmentation operators leveraging item\ncorrelations to create high-quality views for contrastive learning.\nExperimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed method on improving model performance and the robustness\nagainst sparse and noisy data.

    "abstract": "Chest radiograph (CXR) interpretation in pediatric patients is error-prone\nand requires a high level of understanding of radiologic expertise. Recently,\ndeep convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs) have shown remarkable performance\nin interpreting CXR in adults. However, there is a lack of evidence indicating\nthat D-CNNs can recognize accurately multiple lung pathologies from pediatric\nCXR scans. In particular, the development of diagnostic models for the\ndetection of pediatric chest diseases faces significant challenges such as (i)\nlack of physician-annotated datasets and (ii) class imbalance problems. In this\npaper, we retrospectively collect a large dataset of 5,017 pediatric CXR scans,\nfor which each is manually labeled by an experienced radiologist for the\npresence of 10 common pathologies. A D-CNN model is then trained on 3,550\nannotated scans to classify multiple pediatric lung pathologies automatically.\nTo address the high-class imbalance issue, we propose to modify and apply\n\"Distribution-Balanced loss\" for training D-CNNs which reshapes the standard\nBinary-Cross Entropy loss (BCE) to efficiently learn harder samples by\ndown-weighting the loss assigned to the majority classes. On an independent\ntest set of 777 studies, the proposed approach yields an area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.709 (95% CI, 0.690-0.729).

This leads to\nan obstacle in deploying AI solutions for analyzing medical images, which often\nrequires identifying the right body part before feeding the image into a\nspecified AI model. This challenge raises the need for an automated and\nefficient approach to classifying body parts from X-ray scans. Unfortunately,\nto the best of our knowledge, there is no open tool or framework for this task\nto date. To fill this lack, we introduce a DICOM Imaging Router that deploys\ndeep CNNs for categorizing unknown DICOM X-ray images into five anatomical\ngroups: abdominal, adult chest, pediatric chest, spine, and others. To this\nend, a large-scale X-ray dataset consisting of 16,093 images has been collected\nand manually classified. We then trained a set of state-of-the-art deep CNNs\nusing a training set of 11,263 images. These networks were then evaluated on an\nindependent test set of 2,419 images and showed superior performance in\nclassifying the body parts. Specifically, our best performing model achieved a\nrecall of 0.982 (95% CI, 0.977-0.988), a precision of 0.985 (95% CI,\n0.975-0.989) and a F1-score of 0.981 (95% CI, 0.976-0.987), whilst requiring\nless computation for inference (0.0295 second per image). Our external validity\non 1,000 X-ray images shows the robustness of the proposed approach across\nhospitals. These remarkable performances indicate that deep CNNs can accurately\nand effectively differentiate human body parts from X-ray scans, thereby\nproviding potential benefits for a wide range of applications in clinical\nsettings.

    "title": "Collaborative Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning from  Decentralized Data",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised representation learning has achieved outstanding performances\nusing centralized data available on the Internet. However, the increasing\nawareness of privacy protection limits sharing of decentralized unlabeled image\ndata that grows explosively in multiple parties (e.g., mobile phones and\ncameras). As such, a natural problem is how to leverage these data to learn\nvisual representations for downstream tasks while preserving data privacy. To\naddress this problem, we propose a novel federated unsupervised learning\nframework, FedU. In this framework, each party trains models from unlabeled\ndata independently using contrastive learning with an online network and a\ntarget network. Then, a central server aggregates trained models and updates\nclients' models with the aggregated model. It preserves data privacy as each\nparty only has access to its raw data. Decentralized data among multiple\nparties are normally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID),\nleading to performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose two\nsimple but effective methods: 1) We design the communication protocol to upload\nonly the encoders of online networks for server aggregation and update them\nwith the aggregated encoder; 2) We introduce a new module to dynamically decide\nhow to update predictors based on the divergence caused by non-IID. The\npredictor is the other component of the online network. Extensive experiments\nand ablations demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of FedU. It\noutperforms training with only one party by over 5% and other methods by over\n14% in linear and semi-supervised evaluation on non-IID data.",

    "abstract": "Person re-identification (ReID) aims to re-identify a person from\nnon-overlapping camera views. Since person ReID data contains sensitive\npersonal information, researchers have adopted federated learning, an emerging\ndistributed training method, to mitigate the privacy leakage risks. However,\nexisting studies rely on data labels that are laborious and time-consuming to\nobtain. We present FedUReID, a federated unsupervised person ReID system to\nlearn person ReID models without any labels while preserving privacy. FedUReID\nenables in-situ model training on edges with unlabeled data. A cloud server\naggregates models from edges instead of centralizing raw data to preserve data\nprivacy. Moreover, to tackle the problem that edges vary in data volumes and\ndistributions, we personalize training in edges with joint optimization of\ncloud and edge. Specifically, we propose personalized epoch to reassign\ncomputation throughout training, personalized clustering to iteratively predict\nsuitable labels for unlabeled data, and personalized update to adapt the server\naggregated model to each edge. Extensive experiments on eight person ReID\ndatasets demonstrate that FedUReID not only achieves higher accuracy but also\nreduces computation cost by 29%.

    "abstract": "It is often argued that one goal of explaining automated decision systems\n(ADS) is to facilitate positive perceptions (e.g., fairness or trustworthiness)\nof users towards such systems. This viewpoint, however, makes the implicit\nassumption that a given ADS is fair and trustworthy, to begin with. If the ADS\nissues unfair outcomes, then one might expect that explanations regarding the\nsystem's workings will reveal its shortcomings and, hence, lead to a decrease\nin fairness perceptions. Consequently, we suggest that it is more meaningful to\nevaluate explanations against their effectiveness in enabling people to\nappropriately assess the quality (e.g., fairness) of an associated ADS. We\nargue that for an effective explanation, perceptions of fairness should\nincrease if and only if the underlying ADS is fair. In this in-progress work,\nwe introduce the desideratum of appropriate fairness perceptions, propose a\nnovel study design for evaluating it, and outline next steps towards a\ncomprehensive experiment.",

    "title": "LinkTeller: Recovering Private Edges from Graph Neural Networks via  Influence Analysis",
    "abstract": "Graph structured data have enabled several successful applications such as\nrecommendation systems and traffic prediction, given the rich node features and\nedges information. However, these high-dimensional features and high-order\nadjacency information are usually heterogeneous and held by different data\nholders in practice. Given such vertical data partition (e.g., one data holder\nwill only own either the node features or edge information), different data\nholders have to develop efficient joint training protocols rather than directly\ntransfer data to each other due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we focus on\nthe edge privacy, and consider a training scenario where Bob with node features\nwill first send training node features to Alice who owns the adjacency\ninformation. Alice will then train a graph neural network (GNN) with the joint\ninformation and release an inference API. During inference, Bob is able to\nprovide test node features and query the API to obtain the predictions for test\nnodes. Under this setting, we first propose a privacy attack LinkTeller via\ninfluence analysis to infer the private edge information held by Alice via\ndesigning adversarial queries for Bob. We then empirically show that LinkTeller\nis able to recover a significant amount of private edges, outperforming\nexisting baselines. To further evaluate the privacy leakage, we adapt an\nexisting algorithm for differentially private graph convolutional network (DP\nGCN) training and propose a new DP GCN mechanism LapGraph. We show that these\nDP GCN mechanisms are not always resilient against LinkTeller empirically under\nmild privacy guarantees ($\\varepsilon>5$). Our studies will shed light on\nfuture research towards designing more resilient privacy-preserving GCN models;\nin the meantime, provide an in-depth understanding of the tradeoff between GCN\nmodel utility and robustness against potential privacy attacks.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing affordability and availability of patient data, hospitals\ntend to outsource their data to cloud service providers (CSPs) for the purpose\nof storage and analytics. However, the concern of data privacy significantly\nlimits the data owners' choice. In this work, we propose the first solution, to\nthe best of our knowledge, that allows a CSP to perform efficient\nidentification of target patients (e.g., pre-processing for a genome-wide\nassociation study - GWAS) over multi-tenant encrypted phenotype data (owned by\nmultiple hospitals or data owners). We first propose an encryption mechanism\nfor phenotype data, where each data owner is allowed to encrypt its data with a\nunique secret key. Moreover, the ciphertext supports privacy-preserving search\nand, consequently, enables the selection of the target group of patients (e.g.,\ncase and control groups). In addition, we provide a per-query based\nauthorization mechanism for a client to access and operate on the data stored\nat the CSP. Based on the identified patients, the proposed scheme can either\n(i) directly conduct GWAS (i.e., computation of statistics about genomic\nvariants) at the CSP or (ii) provide the identified groups to the client to\ndirectly query the corresponding data owners and conduct GWAS using existing\ndistributed solutions. We implement the proposed scheme and run experiments\nover a real-life genomic dataset to show its effectiveness. The result shows\nthat the proposed solution is capable to efficiently identify the case/control\ngroups in a privacy-preserving way.",

Such attributed accuracy measures become important as machine\nlearning models get deployed as a service, where the training data distribution\nis hidden from clients, and different clients may be interested in diverse\nregions of the data distribution. We present Attributed Accuracy Assay (AAA)--a\nGaussian Process (GP)--based probabilistic estimator for such an accuracy\nsurface.

We expect the GP to\nsmooth the parameters of the Beta density over related arms to mitigate\nsparsity. We show that obvious application of GPs cannot address the challenge\nof heteroscedastic uncertainty over a huge attribute space that is sparsely and\nunevenly populated. In response, we present two enhancements: pooling sparse\nobservations, and regularizing the scale parameter of the Beta densities.

In this paper, a\nHistoryNet including three parts, namely, classification, fine grained semantic\nparsing and colorization, is proposed.

Moreover, we also propose a\nnovel Modern Historical Movies Dataset (MHMD) containing 1,353,166 images and\n42 labels of eras, nationalities, and garment types for automatic colorization\nfrom 147 historical movies or TV series made in modern time.

Our DI-PSS uses skull stripping and\nCycleGAN-based image transformations that map to a standard brain followed by\ntransformation into a brain image taken with a given reference scanner. Then,\nour 3D convolutioinal autoencoders (3D-CAE) with deep metric learning acquires\na low-dimensional embedding that better reflects the characteristics of the\ndisease. The effectiveness of our proposed framework was tested on the\nT1-weighted MRIs selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative\nand the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. We confirmed that our PSS\ngreatly reduced the variability of low-dimensional embeddings caused by\ndifferent scanner and datasets.

These properties allow DI-PSS to generate lower\ndimensional representations that are more amenable to disease classification.\nIn AD and CN classification experiments based on spectral clustering, PSS\nimproved the average accuracy and macro-F1 by 6.2% and 10.7%, respectively.\nGiven the potential of the DI-PSS for harmonizing images scanned by MRI\nscanners that were not used to scan the training data, we expect that the\nDI-PSS is suitable for application to a large number of legacy MRIs scanned in\nheterogeneous environments.",

    "abstract": "Automatic 3D neuron reconstruction is critical for analysing the morphology\nand functionality of neurons in brain circuit activities. However, the\nperformance of existing tracing algorithms is hinged by the low image quality.\nRecently, a series of deep learning based segmentation methods have been\nproposed to improve the quality of raw 3D optical image stacks by removing\nnoises and restoring neuronal structures from low-contrast background. Due to\nthe variety of neuron morphology and the lack of large neuron datasets, most of\ncurrent neuron segmentation models rely on introducing complex and\nspecially-designed submodules to a base architecture with the aim of encoding\nbetter feature representations. Though successful, extra burden would be put on\ncomputation during inference. Therefore, rather than modifying the base\nnetwork, we shift our focus to the dataset itself. The encoder-decoder backbone\nused in most neuron segmentation models attends only intra-volume voxel points\nto learn structural features of neurons but neglect the shared intrinsic\nsemantic features of voxels belonging to the same category among different\nvolumes, which is also important for expressive representation learning. Hence,\nto better utilise the scarce dataset, we propose to explicitly exploit such\nintrinsic features of voxels through a novel voxel-level cross-volume\nrepresentation learning paradigm on the basis of an encoder-decoder\nsegmentation model. Our method introduces no extra cost during inference.\nEvaluated on 42 3D neuron images from BigNeuron project, our proposed method is\ndemonstrated to improve the learning ability of the original segmentation model\nand further enhancing the reconstruction performance.",

With\nonly video annotations, most existing methods seek to handle this task with a\nlocalization-by-classification framework, which generally adopts a selector to\nselect snippets of high probabilities of actions or namely the foreground.\nNevertheless, the existing foreground selection strategies have a major\nlimitation of only considering the unilateral relation from foreground to\nactions, which cannot guarantee the foreground-action consistency.

First,\nour class-wise foreground classification branch regularizes the relation\nbetween actions and foreground to maximize the foreground-background\nseparation. Besides, the class-agnostic attention branch and multiple instance\nlearning branch are adopted to regularize the foreground-action consistency and\nhelp to learn a meaningful foreground classifier. Within each branch, we\nintroduce a hybrid attention mechanism, which calculates multiple attention\nscores for each snippet, to focus on both discriminative and\nless-discriminative snippets to capture the full action boundaries.\nExperimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art performance of our method.

In SEIGuard, the password check\nin authentication is omitted and this design is further combined with the SEI\nencryption design using honey encryption. The login password merely serves as a\ntemporary key to encrypt SEI and there is no password plaintext or ciphertext\nstored in the database. During the login, the server doesn't check the login\npasswords, correct passwords decrypt ciphertexts to be correct plaintexts;\nincorrect passwords decrypt ciphertexts to be phony but plausible-looking\nplaintexts (sampled from the same distribution). And these two situations share\nthe same undifferentiated backend procedures. This scheme eliminates the anchor\nthat both online and offline brute-force attacks depending on. Furthermore,\nthis paper presents four SEIGuard scheme designs and algorithms for 4 typical\nsocial engineering information objects (mobile phone number, identification\nnumber, email address, personal name), which represent 4 different types of\nmessage space, i.e. 1) limited and uniformly distributed, 2) limited, complex\nand uniformly distributed, 3) unlimited and uniformly distributed, 4) unlimited\nand non-uniformly distributed message space. Specially, we propose multiple\nsmall mapping files strategies, binary search algorithms, two-part HE (DTE)\ndesign and incremental mapping files solutions for the applications of SEIGuard\nscheme. Finally, this paper develops the SEIGuard system based on the proposed\nschemes, designs and algorithms. Experiment result shows that the SEIGuard\nscheme can effectively protect server-side SEI against brute-force attacks, and\nSEIGuard also has an impressive real-time response performance that is better\nthan conventional PBE server scheme and HE encryption/decryption.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation (GZS3)\npredicting pixel-wise semantic labels for seen and unseen classes. Most GZS3\nmethods adopt a generative approach that synthesizes visual features of unseen\nclasses from corresponding semantic ones (e.g., word2vec) to train novel\nclassifiers for both seen and unseen classes. Although generative methods show\ndecent performance, they have two limitations: (1) the visual features are\nbiased towards seen classes; (2) the classifier should be retrained whenever\nnovel unseen classes appear. We propose a discriminative approach to address\nthese limitations in a unified framework. To this end, we leverage visual and\nsemantic encoders to learn a joint embedding space, where the semantic encoder\ntransforms semantic features to semantic prototypes that act as centers for\nvisual features of corresponding classes. Specifically, we introduce\nboundary-aware regression (BAR) and semantic consistency (SC) losses to learn\ndiscriminative features. Our approach to exploiting the joint embedding space,\ntogether with BAR and SC terms, alleviates the seen bias problem. At test time,\nwe avoid the retraining process by exploiting semantic prototypes as a\nnearest-neighbor (NN) classifier. To further alleviate the bias problem, we\nalso propose an inference technique, dubbed Apollonius calibration (AC), that\nmodulates the decision boundary of the NN classifier to the Apollonius circle\nadaptively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nframework, achieving a new state of the art on standard benchmarks.",

Instead, we match each point cloud color to the\nholistic view of the panorama image with gradient-descent optimization to find\nthe camera pose. Our loss function, called sampling loss, is point\ncloud-centric, evaluated at the projected location of every point in the point\ncloud. In contrast, conventional photometric loss is image-centric, comparing\ncolors at each pixel location. With a simple change in the compared entities,\nsampling loss effectively overcomes the severe visual distortion of\nomnidirectional images, and enjoys the global context of the 360 view to handle\nchallenging scenarios for visual localization.

    "abstract": "Labeling vertebral discs from MRI scans is important for the proper diagnosis\nof spinal related diseases, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral\nsclerosis, degenerative cervical myelopathy and cancer. Automatic labeling of\nthe vertebral discs in MRI data is a difficult task because of the similarity\nbetween discs and bone area, the variability in the geometry of the spine and\nsurrounding tissues across individuals, and the variability across scans\n(manufacturers, pulse sequence, image contrast, resolution and artefacts). In\nprevious studies, vertebral disc labeling is often done after a disc detection\nstep and mostly fails when the localization algorithm misses discs or has false\npositive detection. In this work, we aim to mitigate this problem by\nreformulating the semantic vertebral disc labeling using the pose estimation\ntechnique. To do so, we propose a stacked hourglass network with multi-level\nattention mechanism to jointly learn intervertebral disc position and their\nskeleton structure. The proposed deep learning model takes into account the\nstrength of semantic segmentation and pose estimation technique to handle the\nmissing area and false positive detection. To further improve the performance\nof the proposed method, we propose a skeleton-based search space to reduce\nfalse positive detection. The proposed method evaluated on spine generic public\nmulti-center dataset and demonstrated better performance comparing to previous\nwork, on both T1w and T2w contrasts.

Spherical glass, a dome port, is well suited for high water\npressures at great depth, allows for a large field of view, and avoids\nrefraction if a pinhole camera is positioned exactly at the sphere's center.\nAdjusting a real lens perfectly to the dome center is a challenging task, both\nin terms of how to actually guide the centering process (e.g. visual servoing)\nand how to measure the alignment quality, but also, how to mechanically perform\nthe alignment. Consequently, such systems are prone to being decentered by some\noffset, leading to challenging refraction patterns at the sphere that\ninvalidate the pinhole camera model. We show that the overall camera system\nbecomes an axial camera, even for thick domes as used for deep sea exploration\nand provide a non-iterative way to compute the center of refraction without\nrequiring knowledge of exact air, glass or water properties. We also analyze\nthe refractive geometry at the sphere, looking at effects such as forward- vs.\nbackward decentering, iso-refraction curves and obtain a 6th-degree polynomial\nequation for forward projection of 3D points in thin domes. We then propose a\npure underwater calibration procedure to estimate the decentering from multiple\nimages.

    "abstract": "Microscopic epidemic models are powerful tools for government policy makers\nto predict and simulate epidemic outbreaks, which can capture the impact of\nindividual behaviors on the macroscopic phenomenon. However, existing models\nonly consider simple rule-based individual behaviors, limiting their\napplicability. This paper proposes a deep-reinforcement-learning-powered\nmicroscopic model named Microscopic Pandemic Simulator (MPS). By replacing\nrule-based agents with rational agents whose behaviors are driven to maximize\nrewards, the MPS provides a better approximation of real world dynamics. To\nefficiently simulate with massive amounts of agents in MPS, we propose Scalable\nMillion-Agent DQN (SMADQN). The MPS allows us to efficiently evaluate the\nimpact of different government strategies. This paper first calibrates the MPS\nagainst real-world data in Allegheny, US, then demonstratively evaluates two\ngovernment strategies: information disclosure and quarantine. The results\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed method. As a broad impact, this\npaper provides novel insights for the application of DRL in large scale\nagent-based networks such as economic and social networks.",

    "title": "Few-Sample Named Entity Recognition for Security Vulnerability Reports  by Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Language Models",
    "abstract": "Public security vulnerability reports (e.g., CVE reports) play an important\nrole in the maintenance of computer and network systems. Security companies and\nadministrators rely on information from these reports to prioritize tasks on\ndeveloping and deploying patches to their customers. Since these reports are\nunstructured texts, automatic information extraction (IE) can help scale up the\nprocessing by converting the unstructured reports to structured forms, e.g.,\nsoftware names and versions and vulnerability types. Existing works on\nautomated IE for security vulnerability reports often rely on a large number of\nlabeled training samples. However, creating massive labeled training set is\nboth expensive and time consuming. In this work, for the first time, we propose\nto investigate this problem where only a small number of labeled training\nsamples are available. In particular, we investigate the performance of\nfine-tuning several state-of-the-art pre-trained language models on our small\ntraining dataset. The results show that with pre-trained language models and\ncarefully tuned hyperparameters, we have reached or slightly outperformed the\nstate-of-the-art system on this task. Consistent with previous two-step process\nof first fine-tuning on main category and then transfer learning to others as\nin [7], if otherwise following our proposed approach, the number of required\nlabeled samples substantially decrease in both stages: 90% reduction in\nfine-tuning from 5758 to 576,and 88.8% reduction in transfer learning with 64\nlabeled samples per category. Our experiments thus demonstrate the\neffectiveness of few-sample learning on NER for security vulnerability report.\nThis result opens up multiple research opportunities for few-sample learning\nfor security vulnerability reports, which is discussed in the paper.

    "abstract": "Few-shot semantic segmentation is a challenging task of predicting object\ncategories in pixel-wise with only few annotated samples. However, existing\napproaches still face two main challenges. First, huge feature distinction\nbetween support and query images causes knowledge transferring barrier, which\nharms the segmentation performance. Second, few support samples cause\nunrepresentative of support features, hardly to guide high-quality query\nsegmentation. To deal with the above two issues, we propose self-distillation\nembedded supervised affinity attention model (SD-AANet) to improve the\nperformance of few-shot segmentation task. Specifically, the self-distillation\nguided prototype module (SDPM) extracts intrinsic prototype by\nself-distillation between support and query to capture representative features.\nThe supervised affinity attention module (SAAM) adopts support ground truth to\nguide the production of high quality query attention map, which can learn\naffinity information to focus on whole area of query target. Extensive\nexperiments prove that our SD-AANet significantly improves the performance\ncomparing with existing methods. Comprehensive ablation experiments and\nvisualization studies also show the significant effect of SDPM and SAAM for\nfew-shot segmentation task. On benchmark datasets, PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i, our\nproposed SD-AANet both achieve state-of-the-art results. Our code will be\npublicly available soon.",

Theories abound for the aptitude of convolutional neural\nnetworks for image classification, but less is understood about why such models\nwould be capable of complex visual tasks such as inference and anomaly\nidentification. Here, we propose a sparse coding interpretation of neural\nnetworks that have ReLU activation and of convolutional neural networks in\nparticular.

    "abstract": "Dropout Regularization, serving to reduce variance, is nearly ubiquitous in\nDeep Learning models. We explore the relationship between the dropout rate and\nmodel complexity by training 2,000 neural networks configured with random\ncombinations of the dropout rate and the number of hidden units in each dense\nlayer, on each of the three data sets we selected. The generated figures, with\nbinary cross entropy loss and binary accuracy on the z-axis, question the\ncommon assumption that adding depth to a dense layer while increasing the\ndropout rate will certainly enhance performance. We also discover a complex\ncorrelation between the two hyperparameters that we proceed to quantify by\nbuilding additional machine learning and Deep Learning models which predict the\noptimal dropout rate given some hidden units in each dense layer. Linear\nregression and polynomial logistic regression require the use of arbitrary\nthresholds to select the cost data points included in the regression and to\nassign the cost data points a binary classification, respectively. These\nmachine learning models have mediocre performance because their naive nature\nprevented the modeling of complex decision boundaries. Turning to Deep Learning\nmodels, we build neural networks that predict the optimal dropout rate given\nthe number of hidden units in each dense layer, the desired cost, and the\ndesired accuracy of the model. Though, this attempt encounters a mathematical\nerror that can be attributed to the failure of the vertical line test. The\nultimate Deep Learning model is a neural network whose decision boundary\nrepresents the 2,000 previously generated data points. This final model leads\nus to devise a promising method for tuning hyperparameters to minimize\ncomputational expense yet maximize performance.

    "abstract": "The time required for training the neural networks increases with size,\ncomplexity, and depth. Training model parameters by backpropagation inherently\ncreates feedback loops. These loops hinder efficient pipelining and scheduling\nof the tasks within the layer and between consecutive layers. Prior approaches,\nsuch as PipeDream, have exploited the use of delayed gradient to achieve\ninter-layer pipelining. However, these approaches treat the entire\nbackpropagation as a single task; this leads to an increase in computation time\nand processor underutilization. This paper presents novel optimization\napproaches where the gradient computations with respect to the weights and the\nactivation functions are considered independently; therefore, these can be\ncomputed in parallel. This is referred to as intra-layer optimization.\nAdditionally, the gradient computation with respect to the activation function\nis further divided into two parts and distributed to two consecutive layers.\nThis leads to balanced scheduling where the computation time of each layer is\nthe same. This is referred to as inter-layer optimization. The proposed system,\nreferred to as LayerPipe, reduces the number of clock cycles required for\ntraining while maximizing processor utilization with minimal inter-processor\ncommunication overhead. LayerPipe achieves an average speedup of 25% and\nupwards of 80% with 7 to 9 processors with less communication overhead when\ncompared to PipeDream.",

Analyses of\nonline information sources that enabled the production of vaccine narratives\nrevealed that vaccine content using low credibility sources was less than 2%,\nand anti-vaccine groups have increasingly more utilized other relatively\ncredible sources, such as government sources and legitimate news media. It was\nalso found that nearly 20% of sources used by anti-vaccine groups each month\nwere not shared by any pro-vaccine groups, and sources that were more widely\nused among anti-vaccine groups tended to represent more conservative and\nfar-right political beliefs.

Typical NMT based code editor only considers\nthe code that needs to be changed as input and suggests developers with a\nranked list of patched code to choose from - where the correct one may not\nalways be at the top of the list. While NMT based code editing systems generate\na broad spectrum of plausible patches, the correct one depends on the\ndevelopers' requirement and often on the context where the patch is applied.\nThus, if developers provide some hints, using natural language, or providing\npatch context, NMT models can benefit from them. As a proof of concept, in this\nresearch, we leverage three modalities of information: edit location, edit code\ncontext, commit messages (as a proxy of developers' hint in natural language)\nto automatically generate edits with NMT models. To that end, we build MODIT, a\nmulti-modal NMT based code editing engine. With in-depth investigation and\nanalysis, we show that developers' hint as an input modality can narrow the\nsearch space for patches and outperform state-of-the-art models to generate\ncorrectly patched code in top-1 position.",

    "abstract": "Fine-grained action recognition is attracting increasing attention due to the\nemerging demand of specific action understanding in real-world applications,\nwhereas the data of rare fine-grained categories is very limited. Therefore, we\npropose the few-shot fine-grained action recognition problem, aiming to\nrecognize novel fine-grained actions with only few samples given for each\nclass. Although progress has been made in coarse-grained actions, existing\nfew-shot recognition methods encounter two issues handling fine-grained\nactions: the inability to capture subtle action details and the inadequacy in\nlearning from data with low inter-class variance. To tackle the first issue, a\nhuman vision inspired bidirectional attention module (BAM) is proposed.\nCombining top-down task-driven signals with bottom-up salient stimuli, BAM\ncaptures subtle action details by accurately highlighting informative\nspatio-temporal regions. To address the second issue, we introduce contrastive\nmeta-learning (CML). Compared with the widely adopted ProtoNet-based method,\nCML generates more discriminative video representations for low inter-class\nvariance data, since it makes full use of potential contrastive pairs in each\ntraining episode. Furthermore, to fairly compare different models, we establish\nspecific benchmark protocols on two large-scale fine-grained action recognition\ndatasets.

We show that PE is equivalent to maintaining the\nmartingale condition of a process. From this perspective, we find that the\nmean--square TD error approximates the quadratic variation of the martingale\nand thus is not a suitable objective for PE. We present two methods to use the\nmartingale characterization for designing PE algorithms. The first one\nminimizes a \"martingale loss function\", whose solution is proved to be the best\napproximation of the true value function in the mean--square sense. This method\ninterprets the classical gradient Monte-Carlo algorithm. The second method is\nbased on a system of equations called the \"martingale orthogonality conditions\"\nwith \"test functions\". Solving these equations in different ways recovers\nvarious classical TD algorithms, such as TD($\\lambda$), LSTD, and GTD.\nDifferent choices of test functions determine in what sense the resulting\nsolutions approximate the true value function.

    "abstract": "Distributed Learning often suffers from Byzantine failures, and there have\nbeen a number of works studying the problem of distributed stochastic\noptimization under Byzantine failures, where only a portion of workers, instead\nof all the workers in a distributed learning system, compute stochastic\ngradients at each iteration. These methods, albeit workable under Byzantine\nfailures, have the shortcomings of either a sub-optimal convergence rate or\nhigh computation cost. To this end, we propose a new Byzantine-resilient\nstochastic gradient descent algorithm (BrSGD for short) which is provably\nrobust against Byzantine failures. BrSGD obtains the optimal statistical\nperformance and efficient computation simultaneously. In particular, BrSGD can\nachieve an order-optimal statistical error rate for strongly convex loss\nfunctions. The computation complexity of BrSGD is O(md), where d is the model\ndimension and m is the number of machines. Experimental results show that BrSGD\ncan obtain competitive results compared with non-Byzantine machines in terms of\neffectiveness and convergence.",

To tackle this challenge, we\npropose a new lightweight and end-to-end learning-based framework.\nSpecifically, on the basis of the intrinsic imaging degradation model of RGB\nimages from HS images, we progressively spread the differences between input\nRGB images and re-projected RGB images from recovered HS images via effective\nunsupervised camera spectral response function estimation. To enable the\nlearning without paired ground-truth HS images as supervision, we adopt the\nadversarial learning manner and boost it with a simple yet effective\n$\\mathcal{L}_1$ gradient clipping scheme. Besides, we embed the semantic\ninformation of input RGB images to locally regularize the unsupervised\nlearning, which is expected to promote pixels with identical semantics to have\nconsistent spectral signatures. In addition to conducting quantitative\nexperiments over two widely-used datasets for HS image reconstruction from\nsynthetic RGB images, we also evaluate our method by applying recovered HS\nimages from real RGB images to HS-based visual tracking.

Particularly, we propose three types of IRS\nbeamforming configurations to strike a balance between the system performance\nand signaling overhead as well as implementation complexity. We first propose\nthe fully dynamic IRS beamforming, where the IRS phase-shift vectors vary with\neach time slot for both DL wireless energy transfer (WET) and UL wireless\ninformation transmission (WIT). To further reduce signaling overhead and\nimplementation complexity, we then study two special cases, namely, partially\ndynamic IRS beamforming and static IRS beamforming. For the former case, two\ndifferent phase-shift vectors can be exploited for the DL WET and the UL WIT,\nrespectively, whereas for the latter case, the same phase-shift vector needs to\nbe applied for both DL and UL transmissions. We aim to maximize the system\nthroughput by jointly optimizing the time allocation, HAP transmit power, and\nIRS phase shifts for the above three cases. Two efficient algorithms based on\nalternating optimization and penalty-based algorithms are respectively proposed\nfor both perfect self-interference cancellation (SIC) case and imperfect SIC\ncase by applying successive convex approximation and difference-of-convex\noptimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of IRS for\nenhancing the performance of FD-WPCN, and also show that the IRS-aided FD-WPCN\nis able to achieve significantly performance gain compared to its counterpart\nwith half-duplex when the self-interference (SI) is properly suppressed.",

    "abstract": "Handwritten character recognition (HCR) is a challenging learning problem in\npattern recognition, mainly due to similarity in structure of characters,\ndifferent handwriting styles, noisy datasets and a large variety of languages\nand scripts. HCR problem is studied extensively for a few decades but there is\nvery limited research on script independent models. This is because of factors,\nlike, diversity of scripts, focus of the most of conventional research efforts\non handcrafted feature extraction techniques which are language/script specific\nand are not always available, and unavailability of public datasets and codes\nto reproduce the results. On the other hand, deep learning has witnessed huge\nsuccess in different areas of pattern recognition, including HCR, and provides\nend-to-end learning, i.e., automated feature extraction and recognition. In\nthis paper, we have proposed a novel deep learning architecture which exploits\ntransfer learning and image-augmentation for end-to-end learning for script\nindependent handwritten character recognition, called HCR-Net. The network is\nbased on a novel transfer learning approach for HCR, where some of lower layers\nof a pre-trained VGG16 network are utilised. Due to transfer learning and\nimage-augmentation, HCR-Net provides faster training, better performance and\nbetter generalisations. The experimental results on publicly available datasets\nof Bangla, Punjabi, Hindi, English, Swedish, Urdu, Farsi, Tibetan, Kannada,\nMalayalam, Telugu, Marathi, Nepali and Arabic languages prove the efficacy of\nHCR-Net and establishes several new benchmarks.

However, due\nto the unclear compartment boundary, thin compartment structure and large\nanatomy variation of 3D kidney CT images, deep-learning based renal compartment\nsegmentation is a challenging task. We propose a novel weakly supervised\nlearning framework, Cycle Prototype Network, for 3D renal compartment\nsegmentation.

It learns from pseudo labels\nthrough the forward process and learns consistency regularization through the\nreverse process. The two processes make the model robust to noise and\nlabel-efficient. 2) We propose a Bayes Weakly Supervised Module (BWSM) based on\ncross-period prior knowledge.

ST3D++ aims at reducing noise in pseudo label generation\nas well as alleviating the negative impacts of noisy pseudo labels on model\ntraining. First, ST3D++ pre-trains the 3D object detector on the labeled source\ndomain with random object scaling (ROS) which is designed to reduce target\ndomain pseudo label noise arising from object scale bias of the source domain.\nThen, the detector is progressively improved through alternating between\ngenerating pseudo labels and training the object detector with pseudo-labeled\ntarget domain data. Here, we equip the pseudo label generation process with a\nhybrid quality-aware triplet memory to improve the quality and stability of\ngenerated pseudo labels. Meanwhile, in the model training stage, we propose a\nsource data assisted training strategy and a curriculum data augmentation\npolicy to effectively rectify noisy gradient directions and avoid model\nover-fitting to noisy pseudo labeled data. These specific designs enable the\ndetector to be trained on meticulously refined pseudo labeled target data with\ndenoised training signals, and thus effectively facilitate adapting an object\ndetector to a target domain without requiring annotations.

The system consists of a\nlow-frequency planning thread (5 Hz) to find an asymptotically optimal path and\na high-frequency reactive thread (300 Hz) to accommodate robot deviation. The\nplanning thread includes: a multi-layer local map to compute traversability for\nthe robot on the terrain; an anytime omnidirectional Control Lyapunov Function\n(CLF) for use with a Rapidly Exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) that generates a\nvector field for specifying motion between nodes; a sub-goal finder when the\nfinal goal is outside of the current map; and a finite-state machine to handle\nhigh-level mission decisions. The system also includes a reactive thread to\nobviate the non-smooth motions that arise with traditional RRT* algorithms when\nperforming path following. The reactive thread copes with robot deviation while\neliminating non-smooth motions via a vector field (defined by a closed-loop\nfeedback policy) that provides real-time control commands to the robot's gait\ncontroller as a function of instantaneous robot pose. The system is evaluated\non various challenging outdoor terrains and cluttered indoor scenes in both\nsimulation and experiment on Cassie Blue, a bipedal robot with 20 degrees of\nfreedom. All implementations are coded in C++ with the Robot Operating System\n(ROS) and are available at\nhttps://github.com/UMich-BipedLab/CLF_reactive_planning_system.",

    "abstract": "With the pandemic of COVID-19, people around the world increasingly work from\nhome. Each natural person typically has several digital identities with\ndifferent associated information. During the last years, various identity and\naccess management approaches have gained attraction, helping for example to\naccess other organization's services within trust boundaries. The resulting\nheterogeneity creates a high complexity to differentiate between these\napproaches and scenarios as participating entity; combining them is even\nharder. Last but not least, various actors have a different understanding or\nperspective of the terms, like 'service', in this context. Our paper describes\na reference service with standard components in generic federated identity\nmanagement. This is utilized with modern Enterprise Architecture using the\nframework ArchiMate. The proposed universal federated identity management\nservice model (FIMSM) is applied to describe various federated identity\nmanagement scenarios in a generic service-oriented way.

    "abstract": "Since its public introduction in the mid-2010s, the Row Hammer (RH)\nphenomenon has drawn significant attention from the research community due to\nits security implications. Although many RH-protection schemes have been\nproposed by processor vendors, DRAM manufacturers, and academia, they still\nhave shortcomings. Solutions implemented in the memory controller (MC) pay an\nincreasingly higher cost due to their conservative design for the worst case in\nterms of the number of DRAM banks and RH threshold to support. Meanwhile, the\nDRAM-side implementation has a limited time margin for RH protection measures\nor requires extensive modifications to the standard DRAM interface. Recently, a\nnew command for RH protection has been introduced in the DDR5/LPDDR5 standards,\ncalled refresh management (RFM). RFM enables the separation of the tasks for RH\nprotection to both MC and DRAM. It does so by having the former generate an RFM\ncommand at a specific activation frequency, and the latter take proper RH\nprotection measures within a given time window. Although promising, no existing\nstudy presents and analyzes RFM-based solutions for RH protection. In this\npaper, we propose Mithril, the first RFM interface-compatible, DRAM-MC\ncooperative RH protection scheme providing deterministic protection guarantees.\nMithril has minimal energy overheads for common use cases without adversarial\nmemory access patterns. We also introduce Mithril+, an extension to provide\nminimal performance overheads at the expense of a tiny modification to the MC\nwhile utilizing an existing DRAM command.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, the success in action recognition on short trimmed\nvideos has led more investigations towards the temporal segmentation of actions\nin untrimmed long videos. Recently, supervised approaches have achieved\nexcellent performance in segmenting complex human actions in untrimmed videos.\nHowever, besides action labels, such approaches also require the start and end\npoints of each action, which is expensive and tedious to collect.\nIn this paper, we aim to learn the action segments taking only the high-level\nactivity labels as input. Under the setting where no action-level supervision\nis provided, Hungarian matching is often used to find the mapping between\nsegments and ground truth actions to evaluate the model and report the\nperformance. On the one hand, we show that with the high-level supervision, we\nare able to generalize the Hungarian matching settings from the current video\nand activity level to the global level. The extended global-level matching\nallows for the shared actions across activities. On the other hand, we propose\na novel action discovery framework that automatically discovers constituent\nactions in videos with the activity classification task. Specifically, we\ndefine a finite number of prototypes to form a dual representation of a video\nsequence. These collectively learned prototypes are considered discovered\nactions. This classification setting endows our approach the capability of\ndiscovering potentially shared actions across multiple complex activities.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the discovered actions are helpful in\nperforming temporal action segmentation and activity recognition.",

While\nrecent 3D detection research focuses on improving performance within a single\ndomain, our study reveals that the performance of modern detectors can drop\ndrastically cross-domain. In this paper, we investigate unsupervised domain\nadaptation (UDA) for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. On the Waymo Domain\nAdaptation dataset, we identify the deteriorating point cloud quality as the\nroot cause of the performance drop. To address this issue, we present Semantic\nPoint Generation (SPG), a general approach to enhance the reliability of LiDAR\ndetectors against domain shifts. Specifically, SPG generates semantic points at\nthe predicted foreground regions and faithfully recovers missing parts of the\nforeground objects, which are caused by phenomena such as occlusions, low\nreflectance or weather interference. By merging the semantic points with the\noriginal points, we obtain an augmented point cloud, which can be directly\nconsumed by modern LiDAR-based detectors. To validate the wide applicability of\nSPG, we experiment with two representative detectors, PointPillars and PV-RCNN.\nOn the UDA task, SPG significantly improves both detectors across all object\ncategories of interest and at all difficulty levels. SPG can also benefit\nobject detection in the original domain.

    "abstract": "Generating conversational gestures from speech audio is challenging due to\nthe inherent one-to-many mapping between audio and body motions. Conventional\nCNNs/RNNs assume one-to-one mapping, and thus tend to predict the average of\nall possible target motions, resulting in plain/boring motions during\ninference. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a novel conditional\nvariational autoencoder (VAE) that explicitly models one-to-many\naudio-to-motion mapping by splitting the cross-modal latent code into shared\ncode and motion-specific code. The shared code mainly models the strong\ncorrelation between audio and motion (such as the synchronized audio and motion\nbeats), while the motion-specific code captures diverse motion information\nindependent of the audio. However, splitting the latent code into two parts\nposes training difficulties for the VAE model. A mapping network facilitating\nrandom sampling along with other techniques including relaxed motion loss,\nbicycle constraint, and diversity loss are designed to better train the VAE.\nExperiments on both 3D and 2D motion datasets verify that our method generates\nmore realistic and diverse motions than state-of-the-art methods,\nquantitatively and qualitatively.

Responding to the above limitations, we propose\na simple method that starts with a model with time-sensitive parameters but\nregularizes its temporal complexity using a Gradient Interpolation (GI) loss.\nGI allows the decision boundary to change along time and can still prevent\noverfitting to the limited training time snapshots by allowing task-specific\ncontrol over changes along time.

    "title": "Effective and Efficient Graph Learning for Multi-view Clustering",
    "abstract": "Despite the impressive clustering performance and efficiency in\ncharacterizing both the relationship between data and cluster structure,\nexisting graph-based multi-view clustering methods still have the following\ndrawbacks. They suffer from the expensive time burden due to both the\nconstruction of graphs and eigen-decomposition of Laplacian matrix, and fail to\nexplore the cluster structure of large-scale data. Moreover, they require a\npost-processing to get the final clustering, resulting in suboptimal\nperformance. Furthermore, rank of the learned view-consensus graph cannot\napproximate the target rank. In this paper, drawing the inspiration from the\nbipartite graph, we propose an effective and efficient graph learning model for\nmulti-view clustering. Specifically, our method exploits the view-similar\nbetween graphs of different views by the minimization of tensor Schatten\np-norm, which well characterizes both the spatial structure and complementary\ninformation embedded in graphs of different views. We learn view-consensus\ngraph with adaptively weighted strategy and connectivity constraint such that\nthe connected components indicates clusters directly. Our proposed algorithm is\ntime-economical and obtains the stable results and scales well with the data\nsize. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method is superior to\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Within electrical distribution networks, substation constraints management\nrequires that aggregated power demand from residential users is kept within\nsuitable bounds. Efficiency of substation constraints management can be\nmeasured as the reduction of constraints violations w.r.t. unmanaged demand.\nHome batteries hold the promise of enabling efficient and user-oblivious\nsubstation constraints management. Centralized control of home batteries would\nachieve optimal efficiency. However, it is hardly acceptable by users, since\nservice providers (e.g., utilities or aggregators) would directly control\nbatteries at user premises. Unfortunately, devising efficient hierarchical\ncontrol strategies, thus overcoming the above problem, is far from easy.\nWe present a novel two-layer control strategy for home batteries that avoids\ndirect control of home devices by the service provider and at the same time\nyields near-optimal substation constraints management efficiency. Our\nsimulation results on field data from 62 households in Denmark show that the\nsubstation constraints management efficiency achieved with our approach is at\nleast 82% of the one obtained with a theoretical optimal centralized strategy.",

In this work, we\npresent a novel, flexible, and effective transformer-based model for\nhigh-quality instance segmentation.

SOTR can effectively\nextract lower-level feature representations and capture long-range context\ndependencies by Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and twin transformer,\nrespectively. Meanwhile, compared with the original transformer, the proposed\ntwin transformer is time- and resource-efficient since only a row and a column\nattention are involved to encode pixels. Moreover, SOTR is easy to be\nincorporated with various CNN backbones and transformer model variants to make\nconsiderable improvements for the segmentation accuracy and training\nconvergence. Extensive experiments show that our SOTR performs well on the MS\nCOCO dataset and surpasses state-of-the-art instance segmentation approaches.\nWe hope our simple but strong framework could serve as a preferment baseline\nfor instance-level recognition.

The common paradigm is to learn object proposals from data labeled\nwith a set of object regions and their corresponding categories. However, this\napproach often struggles with novel objects in the open world that are absent\nin the training set. In this paper, we identify that the problem is that the\nbinary classifiers in existing proposal methods tend to overfit to the training\ncategories. Therefore, we propose a classification-free Object Localization\nNetwork (OLN) which estimates the objectness of each region purely by how well\nthe location and shape of a region overlap with any ground-truth object (e.g.,\ncenterness and IoU). This simple strategy learns generalizable objectness and\noutperforms existing proposals on cross-category generalization on COCO, as\nwell as cross-dataset evaluation on RoboNet, Object365, and EpicKitchens.\nFinally, we demonstrate the merit of OLN for long-tail object detection on\nlarge vocabulary dataset, LVIS, where we notice clear improvement in rare and\ncommon categories.",

    "abstract": "Mainstream math libraries for floating point (FP) do not produce correctly\nrounded results for all inputs. In contrast, CR-LIBM and RLIBM provide\ncorrectly rounded implementations for a specific FP representation with one\nrounding mode. Using such libraries for a representation with a new rounding\nmode or with different precision will result in wrong results due to double\nrounding. This paper proposes a novel method to generate a single polynomial\napproximation that produces correctly rounded results for all inputs for\nmultiple rounding modes and multiple precision configurations. To generate a\ncorrectly rounded library for $n$-bits, our key idea is to generate such a\npolynomial approximation for a representation with $n+2$-bits using the\n\\emph{round-to-odd} mode. We prove that the resulting polynomial approximation\nwill produce correctly rounded results for all five rounding modes in the\nstandard and for multiple representations with $k$-bits such that $|E| +1 < k\n\\leq n$, where $|E|$ is the number of exponent bits in the representation.\nBuilding on our prior work in the RLIBM project, we also approximate the\ncorrectly rounded result when we generate the library with $n+2$-bits using the\nround-to-odd mode. We also generate polynomial approximations by structuring it\nas a linear programming problem but propose enhancements to polynomial\ngeneration to handle the round-to-odd mode. Our prototype is the first 32-bit\nfloat library that produces correctly rounded results with all rounding modes\nin the IEEE standard for all inputs with a single polynomial approximation. It\nalso produces correctly rounded results for any FP configuration ranging from\n10-bits to 32-bits while also being faster than mainstream libraries.",

    "title": "NPBDREG: A Non-parametric Bayesian Deep-Learning Based Approach for  Diffeomorphic Brain MRI Registration",
    "abstract": "Quantification of uncertainty in deep-neural-networks (DNN) based image\nregistration algorithms plays an important role in the safe deployment of\nreal-world medical applications and research-oriented processing pipelines, and\nin improving generalization capabilities. Currently available approaches for\nuncertainty estimation, including the variational encoder-decoder architecture\nand the inference-time dropout approach, require specific network architectures\nand assume parametric distribution of the latent space which may result in\nsub-optimal characterization of the posterior distribution for the predicted\ndeformation-fields. We introduce the NPBDREG, a fully non-parametric Bayesian\nframework for unsupervised DNN-based deformable image registration by combining\nan \\texttt{Adam} optimizer with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) to\ncharacterize the true posterior distribution through posterior sampling. The\nNPBDREG provides a principled non-parametric way to characterize the true\nposterior distribution, thus providing improved uncertainty estimates and\nconfidence measures in a theoretically well-founded and computationally\nefficient way. We demonstrated the added-value of NPBDREG, compared to the\nbaseline probabilistic \\texttt{VoxelMorph} unsupervised model (PrVXM), on brain\nMRI images registration using $390$ image pairs from four publicly available\ndatabases: MGH10, CMUC12, ISBR18 and LPBA40. The NPBDREG shows a slight\nimprovement in the registration accuracy compared to PrVXM (Dice score of\n$0.73$ vs. $0.68$, $p \\ll 0.01$), a better generalization capability for data\ncorrupted by a mixed structure noise (e.g Dice score of $0.729$ vs. $0.686$ for\n$\\alpha=0.2$) and last but foremost, a significantly better correlation of the\npredicted uncertainty with out-of-distribution data ($r>0.95$ vs. $r<0.5$).",

Online continual learning\naims to learn new classes from data stream by using each new data only once\nwithout forgetting the previously learned knowledge. However, none of the\nexisting works target food image analysis, which is more difficult to learn\nincrementally due to its high intra-class variation with the unbalanced and\nunpredictable characteristics of future food class distribution.

The\nde-facto solution to model the dependencies is to feed the data into a\nrecurrent neural network (RNN). However, the fully connected network structure\nunderneath the RNN (either GRU or LSTM) assumes a static and complete\ndependency graph between time-series, which may not hold in many real-world\napplications. To alleviate this assumption, we propose a dynamic bipartite\ngraph structure to encode the inter-dependencies between time-series. More\nconcretely, we model time series as one type of nodes, and the time series\nsegments (regarded as event) as another type of nodes, where the edge between\ntwo types of nodes describe a temporal pattern occurred on a specific time\nseries at a certain time. Based on this design, relations between time series\ncan be explicitly modelled via dynamic connections to event nodes, and the\nmultivariate time-series anomaly detection problem can be formulated as a\nself-supervised, edge stream prediction problem in dynamic graphs.

    "abstract": "Kinodynamic motion planning for non-holomonic mobile robots is a challenging\nproblem that is lacking a universal solution. One of the computationally\nefficient ways to solve it is to build a geometric path first and then\ntransform this path into a kinematically feasible one. Gradient-informed Path\nSmoothing (GRIPS) is a recently introduced method for such transformation.\nGRIPS iteratively deforms the path and adds/deletes the waypoints while trying\nto connect each consecutive pair of them via the provided steering function\nthat respects the kinematic constraints. The algorithm is relatively fast but,\nunfortunately, does not provide any guarantees that it will succeed. In\npractice, it often fails to produce feasible trajectories for car-like robots\nwith large turning radius. In this work, we introduce a range of modifications\nthat are aimed at increasing the success rate of GRIPS for car-like robots. The\nmain enhancement is adding the additional step that heuristically samples\nwaypoints along the bottleneck parts of the geometric paths (such as sharp\nturns). The results of the experimental evaluation provide a clear evidence\nthat the success rate of the suggested algorithm is up to 40% higher compared\nto the original GRIPS and hits the bar of 90%, while its runtime is lower.",

This annotation issue is more concerned for aerial\nimages: Aerial data collected from sensors naturally cover a relatively large\nland area with multiple labels, while annotated aerial datasets, which are\npublicly available (e.g., UCM, AID), are single-labeled. As manually annotating\nmulti-label aerial images would be time/labor-consuming, we propose a novel\nself-correction integrated domain adaptation (SCIDA) method for automatic\nmulti-label learning.

To achieve this goal, we propose a novel\nLabel-Wise self-Correction (LWC) module to better explore underlying label\ncorrelations. This module also makes the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)\nfrom single- to multi-label data possible.

For parallel training and simple\ndesign purposes, the proposed MILP model is first decomposed into a number of\nsub-problems and, then, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained to\npredict content caching locations of these sub-problems. Furthermore, since the\nMILP model decomposition neglects the internal effects among sub-problems, the\nCNNs' outputs have the risk to be infeasible solutions. Therefore, two\nalgorithms are provided: the first uses predictions from CNNs as an extra\nconstraint to reduce the number of decision variables; the second employs CNNs'\noutputs to accelerate local search. Numerical results show that the proposed\nscheme can reduce 71.6% computation time with only 0.8% additional performance\ncost compared to the MILP solution, which provides high quality decision making\nin real-time.",

    "abstract": "Event camera is an emerging imaging sensor for capturing dynamics of moving\nobjects as events, which motivates our work in estimating 3D human pose and\nshape from the event signals. Events, on the other hand, have their unique\nchallenges: rather than capturing static body postures, the event signals are\nbest at capturing local motions. This leads us to propose a two-stage deep\nlearning approach, called EventHPE. The first-stage, FlowNet, is trained by\nunsupervised learning to infer optical flow from events. Both events and\noptical flow are closely related to human body dynamics, which are fed as input\nto the ShapeNet in the second stage, to estimate 3D human shapes. To mitigate\nthe discrepancy between image-based flow (optical flow) and shape-based flow\n(vertices movement of human body shape), a novel flow coherence loss is\nintroduced by exploiting the fact that both flows are originated from the\nidentical human motion. An in-house event-based 3D human dataset is curated\nthat comes with 3D pose and shape annotations, which is by far the largest one\nto our knowledge. Empirical evaluations on DHP19 dataset and our in-house\ndataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

Through\nexperience, users have refined multiple strategies to foster good\ncross-partisan engagement. Contrary to offline settings where knowing about the\ninterlocutor can help manage disagreements, on Reddit, some users look to\nactively learn as little as possible about their outpartisan interlocutors for\nfear that such information may bias their interactions. Through design probes\nabout hypothetical features intended to reduce partisan hostility, we find that\nusers are actually open to knowing certain kinds of information about their\ninterlocutors, such as non-political subreddits that they both participate in,\nand to having that information made visible to their interlocutors.

Polarization camera is known to be able to capture\nthe polarization of reflected lights that preserves rich geometric cues of an\nobject surface. Inspired by the recent applications in surface normal\nreconstruction from polarization images, in this paper, we attempt to estimate\nhuman pose and shape from single polarization images by leveraging the\npolarization-induced geometric cues. A dedicated two-stage pipeline is\nproposed: given a single polarization image, stage one (Polar2Normal) focuses\non the fine detailed human body surface normal estimation; stage two\n(Polar2Shape) then reconstructs clothed human shape from the polarization image\nand the estimated surface normal. To empirically validate our approach, a\ndedicated dataset (PHSPD) is constructed, consisting of over 500K frames with\naccurate pose and shape annotations. Empirical evaluations on this real-world\ndataset as well as a synthetic dataset, SURREAL, demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach.

With Human Activity\nRecognition (HAR), applications could track if a patient took his pills and\ndetect the behavioral changes associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's.\nCurrent systems for HAR require diverse sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones,\nproximity sensors, and accelerometers) placed throughout the environment to\nprovide detailed observations needed for high-accuracy HAR. The difficulty of\ninstrumenting an environment with these sensors makes this approach\nimpractical.\nThis project considers whether recent advances in indoor localization (Wi-Fi\nRound Trip Time) enable high-accuracy HAR using only a smartphone. My design,\ncalled Location-Enhanced HAR (LEHAR), uses machine learning to combine\nacceleration, audio, and location data to detect common human activities. A\nLEHAR prototype, designed to recognize a dozen common activities conducted in a\ntypical household, achieved an F1-score of 0.965. In contrast, existing\napproaches, which use only acceleration or audio data, obtained F1-scores of\n0.660 and 0.865, respectively, on the same activities. In addition, the\nF1-score of existing designs dropped significantly as more activities were\nadded for recognition, while LEHAR was able to maintain high accuracy.

Firstly, we design the network of ML-MemAE-SC (Multi-Level\nMemory modules in an Autoencoder with Skip Connections) to memorize normal\npatterns for optical flow reconstruction so that abnormal events can be\nsensitively identified with larger flow reconstruction errors. More\nimportantly, conditioned on the reconstructed flows, we then employ a\nConditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which captures the high correlation\nbetween video frame and optical flow, to predict the next frame given several\nprevious frames. By CVAE, the quality of flow reconstruction essentially\ninfluences that of frame prediction. Therefore, poorly reconstructed optical\nflows of abnormal events further deteriorate the quality of the final predicted\nfuture frame, making the anomalies more detectable.

In this paper, we propose a novel model to address the NR-IQA task by\nleveraging a hybrid approach that benefits from Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) and self-attention mechanism in Transformers to extract both local and\nnon-local features from the input image. We capture local structure information\nof the image via CNNs, then to circumvent the locality bias among the extracted\nCNNs features and obtain a non-local representation of the image, we utilize\nTransformers on the extracted features where we model them as a sequential\ninput to the Transformer model. Furthermore, to improve the monotonicity\ncorrelation between the subjective and objective scores, we utilize the\nrelative distance information among the images within each batch and enforce\nthe relative ranking among them. Last but not least, we observe that the\nperformance of NR-IQA models degrades when we apply equivariant transformations\n(e.g. horizontal flipping) to the inputs. Therefore, we propose a method that\nleverages self-consistency as a source of self-supervision to improve the\nrobustness of NRIQA models. Specifically, we enforce self-consistency between\nthe outputs of our quality assessment model for each image and its\ntransformation (horizontally flipped) to utilize the rich self-supervisory\ninformation and reduce the uncertainty of the model. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our work, we evaluate it on seven standard IQA datasets (both\nsynthetic and authentic) and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on various datasets.",

    "abstract": "Due to the variety of cyber-attacks or threats, the cybersecurity community\nhas been enhancing the traditional security control mechanisms to an advanced\nlevel so that automated tools can encounter potential security threats. Very\nrecently a term, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has been represented as one of\nthe proactive and robust mechanisms because of its automated cybersecurity\nthreat prediction based on data. In general, CTI collects and analyses data\nfrom various sources e.g. online security forums, social media where cyber\nenthusiasts, analysts, even cybercriminals discuss cyber or computer security\nrelated topics and discovers potential threats based on the analysis. As the\nmanual analysis of every such discussion i.e. posts on online platforms is\ntime-consuming, inefficient, and susceptible to errors, CTI as an automated\ntool can perform uniquely to detect cyber threats. In this paper, our goal is\nto identify and explore relevant CTI from hacker forums by using different\nsupervised and unsupervised learning techniques. To this end, we collect data\nfrom a real hacker forum and constructed two datasets: a binary dataset and a\nmulti-class dataset. Our binary dataset contains two classes one containing\ncybersecurity-relevant posts and another one containing posts that are not\nrelated to security. This dataset is constructed using simple keyword search\ntechnique. Using a similar approach, we further categorize posts from\nsecurity-relevant posts into five different threat categories. We then applied\nseveral machine learning classifiers along with deep neural network-based\nclassifiers and use them on the datasets to compare their performances. We also\ntested the classifiers on a leaked dataset with labels named nulled.io as our\nground truth. We further explore the datasets using unsupervised techniques\ni.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization\n(NMF).",

    "abstract": "A central question in federated learning (FL) is how to design optimization\nalgorithms that minimize the communication cost of training a model over\nheterogeneous data distributed across many clients. A popular technique for\nreducing communication is the use of local steps, where clients take multiple\noptimization steps over local data before communicating with the server (e.g.,\nFedAvg, SCAFFOLD). This contrasts with centralized methods, where clients take\none optimization step per communication round (e.g., Minibatch SGD). A recent\nlower bound on the communication complexity of first-order methods shows that\ncentralized methods are optimal over highly-heterogeneous data, whereas local\nmethods are optimal over purely homogeneous data [Woodworth et al., 2020]. For\nintermediate heterogeneity levels, no algorithm is known to match the lower\nbound. In this paper, we propose a multistage optimization scheme that nearly\nmatches the lower bound across all heterogeneity levels. The idea is to first\nrun a local method up to a heterogeneity-induced error floor; next, we switch\nto a centralized method for the remaining steps. Our analysis may help explain\nempirically-successful stepsize decay methods in FL [Charles et al., 2020;\nReddi et al., 2020]. We demonstrate the scheme's practical utility in image\nclassification tasks.",

Data augmentation is a widely used strategy that improves the\ntraining of CNNs, and the design of the augmentation method for brain lesion\nsegmentation is still an open problem. In this work, we propose a simple data\naugmentation approach, dubbed as CarveMix, for CNN-based brain lesion\nsegmentation. Like other \"mix\"-based methods, such as Mixup and CutMix,\nCarveMix stochastically combines two existing labeled images to generate new\nlabeled samples. Yet, unlike these augmentation strategies based on image\ncombination, CarveMix is lesion-aware, where the combination is performed with\nan attention on the lesions and a proper annotation is created for the\ngenerated image. Specifically, from one labeled image we carve a region of\ninterest (ROI) according to the lesion location and geometry, and the size of\nthe ROI is sampled from a probability distribution. The carved ROI then\nreplaces the corresponding voxels in a second labeled image, and the annotation\nof the second image is replaced accordingly as well. In this way, we generate\nnew labeled images for network training and the lesion information is\npreserved. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were performed on two\nbrain lesion datasets.

In this work, we consider how to efficiently retrain graph\nconvolution network (GCN) based recommender models, which are state-of-the-art\ntechniques for collaborative recommendation. To pursue high efficiency, we set\nthe target as using only new data for model updating, meanwhile not sacrificing\nthe recommendation accuracy compared with full model retraining. This is\nnon-trivial to achieve, since the interaction data participates in both the\ngraph structure for model construction and the loss function for model\nlearning, whereas the old graph structure is not allowed to use in model\nupdating. Towards the goal, we propose a \\textit{Causal Incremental Graph\nConvolution} approach, which consists of two new operators named\n\\textit{Incremental Graph Convolution} (IGC) and \\textit{Colliding Effect\nDistillation} (CED) to estimate the output of full graph convolution. In\nparticular, we devise simple and effective modules for IGC to ingeniously\ncombine the old representations and the incremental graph and effectively fuse\nthe long-term and short-term preference signals. CED aims to avoid the\nout-of-date issue of inactive nodes that are not in the incremental graph,\nwhich connects the new data with inactive nodes through causal inference.

    "abstract": "We present Memtrade, the first memory disaggregation system for public\nclouds. Public clouds introduce a set of unique challenges for resource\ndisaggregation across different tenants, including security, isolation and\npricing. Memtrade allows producer virtual machines (VMs) to lease both their\nunallocated memory and allocated-but-idle application memory to remote consumer\nVMs for a limited period of time. Memtrade does not require any modifications\nto host-level system software or support from the cloud provider. It harvests\nproducer memory using an application-aware control loop to form a distributed\ntransient remote memory pool with minimal performance impact; it employs a\nbroker to match producers with consumers while satisfying performance\nconstraints; and it exposes the matched memory to consumers as a secure KV\ncache. Our evaluation using real-world cluster traces shows that Memtrade\nprovides significant performance benefit for consumers (improving average read\nlatency up to 2.8x) while preserving confidentiality and integrity, with little\nimpact on producer applications (degrading performance by less than 2.1%).",

    "abstract": "While deep reinforcement learning has achieved promising results in\nchallenging decision-making tasks, the main bones of its success --- deep\nneural networks are mostly black-boxes. A feasible way to gain insight into a\nblack-box model is to distill it into an interpretable model such as a decision\ntree, which consists of if-then rules and is easy to grasp and be verified.\nHowever, the traditional model distillation is usually a supervised learning\ntask under a stationary data distribution assumption, which is violated in\nreinforcement learning. Therefore, a typical policy distillation that clones\nmodel behaviors with even a small error could bring a data distribution shift,\nresulting in an unsatisfied distilled policy model with low fidelity or low\nperformance. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by changing the\ndistillation objective from behavior cloning to maximizing an advantage\nevaluation. The novel distillation objective maximizes an approximated\ncumulative reward and focuses more on disastrous behaviors in critical states,\nwhich controls the data shift effect. We evaluate our method on several Gym\ntasks, a commercial fight game, and a self-driving car simulator. The empirical\nresults show that the proposed method can preserve a higher cumulative reward\nthan behavior cloning and learn a more consistent policy to the original one.\nMoreover, by examining the extracted rules from the distilled decision trees,\nwe demonstrate that the proposed method delivers reasonable and robust\ndecisions.",

    "abstract": "Failure trajectories, identifying the probable failure zones, and damage\nstatistics are some of the key quantities of relevance in brittle fracture\napplications. High-fidelity numerical solvers that reliably estimate these\nrelevant quantities exist but they are computationally demanding requiring a\nhigh resolution of the crack. Moreover, independent intensive simulations need\nto be carried out even for a small change in domain parameters and/or material\nproperties. Therefore, fast and generalizable surrogate models are needed to\nalleviate the computational burden but the discontinuous nature of fracture\nmechanics presents a major challenge to developing such models. We propose a\nphysics-informed variational formulation of DeepONet (V-DeepONet) for brittle\nfracture analysis. V-DeepONet is trained to map the initial configuration of\nthe defect to the relevant fields of interests (e.g., damage and displacement\nfields). Once the network is trained, the entire global solution can be rapidly\nobtained for any initial crack configuration and loading steps on that domain.\nWhile the original DeepONet is solely data-driven, we take a different path to\ntrain the V-DeepONet by imposing the governing equations in variational form\nand we also use some labelled data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nV-DeepOnet through two benchmarks of brittle fracture, and we verify its\naccuracy using results from high-fidelity solvers. Encoding the physical laws\nand also some data to train the network renders the surrogate model capable of\naccurately performing both interpolation and extrapolation tasks, considering\nthat fracture modeling is very sensitive to fluctuations. The proposed hybrid\ntraining of V-DeepONet is superior to state-of-the-art methods and can be\napplied to a wide array of dynamical systems with complex responses.",

Existing FL designs have been shown to exhibit\nvulnerabilities which can be exploited by adversaries both within and outside\nof the system to compromise data privacy. However, most current works conduct\nattacks by leveraging gradients on a small batch of data, which is less\npractical in FL. In this work, we consider a more practical and interesting\nscenario in which participants share their epoch-averaged gradients (share\ngradients after at least 1 epoch of local training) rather than per-example or\nsmall batch-averaged gradients as in previous works. We perform the first\nsystematic evaluation of attribute reconstruction attack (ARA) launched by the\nmalicious server in the FL system, and empirically demonstrate that the shared\nepoch-averaged local model gradients can reveal sensitive attributes of local\ntraining data of any victim participant. To achieve this goal, we develop a\nmore effective and efficient gradient matching based method called cos-matching\nto reconstruct the training data attributes.

Recent works make use of deep neural networks to\naccelerate this process, by improving either low-resolution or fewer-sample\nrendering with super-resolution or denoising neural networks in\npost-processing. However, denoising and super-resolution have only been\nconsidered separately in previous work.

This new type of joint filtering allows only a\nlow-resolution and fewer-sample (thus noisy) image to be rendered by path\ntracing, which is then fed into a deep neural network to produce a\nhigh-resolution and clean image. The main contribution of this work is a new\nend-to-end network architecture, specifically designed for the SRD task. It\ncontains two cascaded stages with shared components.

    "abstract": "Electromyography (EMG) refers to a biomedical signal indicating neuromuscular\nactivity and muscle morphology. Experts accurately diagnose neuromuscular\ndisorders using this time series. Modern data analysis techniques have recently\nled to introducing novel approaches for mapping time series data to graphs and\ncomplex networks with applications in diverse fields, including medicine. The\nresulting networks develop a completely different visual acuity that can be\nused to complement physician findings of time series. This can lead to a more\nenriched analysis, reduced error, more accurate diagnosis of the disease, and\nincreased accuracy and speed of the treatment process. The mapping process may\ncause the loss of essential data from the time series and not retain all the\ntime series features. As a result, achieving an approach that can provide a\ngood representation of the time series while maintaining essential features is\ncrucial. This paper proposes a new approach to network development named\nGraphTS to overcome the limited accuracy of existing methods through EMG time\nseries using the visibility graph method. For this purpose, EMG signals are\npre-processed and mapped to a complex network by a standard visibility graph\nalgorithm. The resulting networks can differentiate between healthy and patient\nsamples. In the next step, the properties of the developed networks are given\nin the form of a feature matrix as input to classifiers after extracting\noptimal features. Performance evaluation of the proposed approach with deep\nneural network shows 99.30% accuracy for training data and 99.18% for test\ndata. Therefore, in addition to enriched network representation and covering\nthe features of time series for healthy, myopathy, and neuropathy EMG, the\nproposed technique improves accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.",

    "abstract": "Most polyp segmentation methods use CNNs as their backbone, leading to two\nkey issues when exchanging information between the encoder and decoder: 1)\ntaking into account the differences in contribution between different-level\nfeatures; and 2) designing effective mechanism for fusing these features.\nDifferent from existing CNN-based methods, we adopt a transformer encoder,\nwhich learns more powerful and robust representations. In addition, considering\nthe image acquisition influence and elusive properties of polyps, we introduce\nthree novel modules, including a cascaded fusion module (CFM), a camouflage\nidentification module (CIM), a and similarity aggregation module (SAM). Among\nthese, the CFM is used to collect the semantic and location information of\npolyps from high-level features, while the CIM is applied to capture polyp\ninformation disguised in low-level features. With the help of the SAM, we\nextend the pixel features of the polyp area with high-level semantic position\ninformation to the entire polyp area, thereby effectively fusing cross-level\nfeatures. The proposed model, named \\ourmodel, effectively suppresses noises in\nthe features and significantly improves their expressive capabilities.\nExtensive experiments on five widely adopted datasets show that the proposed\nmodel is more robust to various challenging situations (e.g., appearance\nchanges, small objects) than existing methods, and achieves the new\nstate-of-the-art performance. The proposed model is available at\nhttps://github.com/DengPingFan/Polyp-PVT .",

    "abstract": "Non-overlapping codes are a set of codewords in $\\bigcup_{n \\ge 2}\n\\mathbb{Z}_q^n$, where $\\mathbb{Z}_q = \\{0,1,\\dots,q-1\\}$, such that, the\nprefix of each codeword is not a suffix of any codeword in the set, including\nitself; and for variable-length codes, a codeword does not contain any other\ncodeword as a subword. In this paper, we investigate a generic method to\ngeneralize binary codes to $q$-ary for $q > 2$, and analyze this generalization\non the two constructions given by Levenshtein (also by Gilbert; Chee, Kiah,\nPurkayastha, and Wang) and Bilotta, respectively. The generalization on the\nformer construction gives large non-expandable fixed-length non-overlapping\ncodes whose size can be explicitly determined; the generalization on the later\nconstruction is the first attempt to generate $q$-ary variable-length\nnon-overlapping codes. More importantly, this generic method allows us to\nutilize the generating function approach to analyze the cardinality of the\nunderlying $q$-ary non-overlapping codes. The generating function approach not\nonly enables us to derive new results, e.g., recurrence relations on their\ncardinalities, new combinatorial interpretations for the constructions, and the\nlimit superior of their cardinalities for some special cases, but also greatly\nsimplifies the arguments for these results. Furthermore, we give an exact\nformula for the number of fixed-length words that do not contain the codewords\nin a variable-length non-overlapping code as subwords. This thereby solves an\nopen problem by Bilotta and induces a recursive upper bound on the maximum size\nof variable-length non-overlapping codes.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) has attracted increasing\nresearch interests because of its scalability and possibility for real-world\napplications. State-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods usually follow a\nclustering-based strategy, which generates pseudo labels by clustering and\nmaintains a memory to store instance features and represent the centroid of the\nclusters for contrastive learning. This approach suffers two problems. First,\nthe centroid generated by unsupervised learning may not be a perfect prototype.\nForcing images to get closer to the centroid emphasizes the result of\nclustering, which could accumulate clustering errors during iterations. Second,\nprevious methods utilize features obtained at different training iterations to\nrepresent one centroid, which is not consistent with the current training\nsample, since the features are not directly comparable. To this end, we propose\nan unsupervised re-ID approach with a stochastic learning strategy.\nSpecifically, we adopt a stochastic updated memory, where a random instance\nfrom a cluster is used to update the cluster-level memory for contrastive\nlearning. In this way, the relationship between randomly selected pair of\nimages are learned to avoid the training bias caused by unreliable pseudo\nlabels. The stochastic memory is also always up-to-date for classifying to keep\nthe consistency. Besides, to relieve the issue of camera variance, a unified\ndistance matrix is proposed during clustering, where the distance bias from\ndifferent camera domain is reduced and the variances of identities is\nemphasized.",

    "abstract": "Surface defect detection plays an increasingly important role in\nmanufacturing industry to guarantee the product quality. Many deep learning\nmethods have been widely used in surface defect detection tasks, and have been\nproven to perform well in defects classification and location. However, deep\nlearning-based detection methods often require plenty of data for training,\nwhich fail to apply to the real industrial scenarios since the distribution of\ndefect categories is often imbalanced. In other words, common defect classes\nhave many samples but rare defect classes have extremely few samples, and it is\ndifficult for these methods to well detect rare defect classes. To solve the\nimbalanced distribution problem, in this paper we propose TL-SDD: a novel\nTransfer Learning-based method for Surface Defect Detection. First, we adopt a\ntwo-phase training scheme to transfer the knowledge from common defect classes\nto rare defect classes. Second, we propose a novel Metric-based Surface Defect\nDetection (M-SDD) model. We design three modules for this model: (1) feature\nextraction module: containing feature fusion which combines high-level semantic\ninformation with low-level structural information. (2) feature reweighting\nmodule: transforming examples to a reweighting vector that indicates the\nimportance of features. (3) distance metric module: learning a metric space in\nwhich defects are classified by computing distances to representations of each\ncategory. Finally, we validate the performance of our proposed method on a real\ndataset including surface defects of aluminum profiles. Compared to the\nbaseline methods, the performance of our proposed method has improved by up to\n11.98% for rare defect classes.",

One fundamental problem for\nCKM-enabled communication is how to efficiently construct the CKM based on\nfinite measurement data points at limited user locations. Towards this end,\nthis paper proposes a novel map construction method based on the\n\\emph{expectation maximization} (EM) algorithm, by utilizing the available\nmeasurement data, jointly with the expert knowledge of well-established\nstatistic channel models. The key idea is to partition the available data\npoints into different groups, where each group shares the same modelling\nparameter values to be determined. We show that determining the modelling\nparameter values can be formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation problem\nwith latent variables, which is then efficiently solved by the classic EM\nalgorithm. Compared to the pure data-driven methods such as the nearest\nneighbor based interpolation, the proposed method is more efficient since only\na small number of modelling parameters need to be determined and stored.\nFurthermore, the proposed method is extended for constructing a specific type\nof CKM, namely, the channel gain map (CGM), where closed-form expressions are\nderived for the E-step and M-step of the EM algorithm.

To this end, we introduce two adversarial frameworks:\n(i) multi-discriminator, which explicitly aligns each target domain to its\ncounterparts, and (ii) multi-target knowledge transfer, which learns a\ntarget-agnostic model thanks to a multi-teacher/single-student distillation\nmechanism.The evaluation is done on four newly-proposed multi-target benchmarks\nfor UDA in semantic segmentation. In all tested scenarios, our approaches\nconsistently outperform baselines, setting competitive standards for the novel\ntask.",

Existing work predominantly adopts simple statistical\nmeasures, such as the difference of mean or median popularity, to quantify\npopularity bias. Moreover, it does so irrespective of user characteristics\nother than the inclination to popular content. In this work, in contrast, we\npropose to investigate popularity differences (between the user profile and\nrecommendation list) in terms of median, a variety of statistical moments, as\nwell as similarity measures that consider the entire popularity distributions\n(Kullback-Leibler divergence and Kendall's tau rank-order correlation).

We investigate the algorithmic\npopularity bias of seven common recommendation algorithms (five collaborative\nfiltering and two baselines).

    "abstract": "Detecting drifts in data is essential for machine learning applications, as\nchanges in the statistics of processed data typically has a profound influence\non the performance of trained models. Most of the available drift detection\nmethods require access to true labels during inference time. In a real-world\nscenario, true labels usually available only during model training. In this\nwork, we propose a novel task-sensitive drift detection framework, which is\nable to detect drifts without access to true labels during inference. It\nutilizes metric learning of a constrained low-dimensional embedding\nrepresentation of the input data, which is best suited for the classification\ntask. It is able to detect real drift, where the drift affects the\nclassification performance, while it properly ignores virtual drift, where the\nclassification performance is not affected by the drift. In the proposed\nframework, the actual method to detect a change in the statistics of incoming\ndata samples can be chosen freely. We also propose the two change detection\nmethods, which are based on the exponential moving average and a modified\n$z$-score, respectively. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework\nwith a novel metric, which accumulates the standard metrics of detection\naccuracy, false positive rate and detection delay into one value. Experimental\nevaluation on nine benchmarks datasets, with different types of drift,\ndemonstrates that the proposed framework can reliably detect drifts, and\noutperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised drift detection approaches.",

Quantization\nmethods use a rounding function to map full-precision values to the nearest\nquantized ones, but this operation is not differentiable. There are mainly two\napproaches to training quantized networks with gradient-based optimizers.\nFirst, a straight-through estimator (STE) replaces the zero derivative of the\nrounding with that of an identity function, which causes a gradient mismatch\nproblem. Second, soft quantizers approximate the rounding with continuous\nfunctions at training time, and exploit the rounding for quantization at test\ntime. This alleviates the gradient mismatch, but causes a quantizer gap\nproblem. We alleviate both problems in a unified framework. To this end, we\nintroduce a novel quantizer, dubbed a distance-aware quantizer (DAQ), that\nmainly consists of a distance-aware soft rounding (DASR) and a temperature\ncontroller. To alleviate the gradient mismatch problem, DASR approximates the\ndiscrete rounding with the kernel soft argmax, which is based on our insight\nthat the quantization can be formulated as a distance-based assignment problem\nbetween full-precision values and quantized ones. The controller adjusts the\ntemperature parameter in DASR adaptively according to the input, addressing the\nquantizer gap problem.

    "abstract": "Recently, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can achieve human-level\nperformance in edge detection with the rich and abstract edge representation\ncapacities. However, the high performance of CNN based edge detection is\nachieved with a large pretrained CNN backbone, which is memory and energy\nconsuming. In addition, it is surprising that the previous wisdom from the\ntraditional edge detectors, such as Canny, Sobel, and LBP are rarely\ninvestigated in the rapid-developing deep learning era. To address these\nissues, we propose a simple, lightweight yet effective architecture named Pixel\nDifference Network (PiDiNet) for efficient edge detection. Extensive\nexperiments on BSDS500, NYUD, and Multicue are provided to demonstrate its\neffectiveness, and its high training and inference efficiency. Surprisingly,\nwhen training from scratch with only the BSDS500 and VOC datasets, PiDiNet can\nsurpass the recorded result of human perception (0.807 vs. 0.803 in ODS\nF-measure) on the BSDS500 dataset with 100 FPS and less than 1M parameters. A\nfaster version of PiDiNet with less than 0.1M parameters can still achieve\ncomparable performance among state of the arts with 200 FPS. Results on the\nNYUD and Multicue datasets show similar observations. The codes are available\nat https://github.com/zhuoinoulu/pidinet.",

To the best of\nour knowledge, it is the largest prohibited items detection dataset to date.\nMeanwhile, we design the selective dense attention network (SDANet) to\nconstruct a strong baseline, which consists of the dense attention module and\nthe dependency refinement module. The dense attention module formed by the\nspatial and channel-wise dense attentions, is designed to learn the\ndiscriminative features to boost the performance.

    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) targets at recognizing unseen categories by\nleveraging auxiliary information, such as attribute embedding. Despite the\nencouraging results achieved, prior ZSL approaches focus on improving the\ndiscriminant power of seen-class features, yet have largely overlooked the\ngeometric structure of the samples and the prototypes. The subsequent\nattribute-based generative adversarial network (GAN), as a result, also\nneglects the topological information in sample generation and further yields\ninferior performances in classifying the visual features of unseen classes. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel structure-aware feature generation scheme,\ntermed as SA-GAN, to explicitly account for the topological structure in\nlearning both the latent space and the generative networks. Specifically, we\nintroduce a constraint loss to preserve the initial geometric structure when\nlearning a discriminative latent space, and carry out our GAN training with\nadditional supervising signals from a structure-aware discriminator and a\nreconstruction module. The former supervision distinguishes fake and real\nsamples based on their affinity to class prototypes, while the latter aims to\nreconstruct the original feature space from the generated latent space. This\ntopology-preserving mechanism enables our method to significantly enhance the\ngeneralization capability on unseen-classes and consequently improve the\nclassification performance. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that the\nproposed approach consistently outperforms the state of the art.

The application of building metadata simplifies the creation of digital\nrepresentations and provides portable data analytics. Typical metadata\nstandards such as Brick and Haystack are used to describe the data of the\nbuilding system. Brick uses standard ontologies to create building metadata.\nHowever, neither Haystack nor Brick has provided definitions about the Variable\nRefrigerant Flow (VRF) system so far. For years, both Brick and Haystack\nworking groups have been discussing how to describe VRF in their schema, mainly\nabout the classification of VRF and the definitions of VRF units. There were no\nsettled solutions for these problems. Meanwhile, the global VRF market is\ngrowing increasingly fast because of the energy efficiency and installation\nsimplicity of the VRF system. It is needed to have the metadata to describe VRF\nunits in buildings for data analysis and management. Addressing this challenge,\nthis paper extended Brick Schema with the VRF module and verified the Brick VRF\nmodule. Then, the model and the service framework were developed and applied\nfor a building in China. The framework can serve portable energy analysis for\ndifferent areas. The VRF module of this paper provides a possible solution for\nthe expression of the VRF system in the building semantic web.

    "abstract": "The $Q$-function is a central quantity in many Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nalgorithms for which RL agents behave following a (soft)-greedy policy w.r.t.\nto $Q$. It is a powerful tool that allows action selection without a model of\nthe environment and even without explicitly modeling the policy. Yet, this\nscheme can only be used in discrete action tasks, with small numbers of\nactions, as the softmax cannot be computed exactly otherwise. Especially the\nusage of function approximation, to deal with continuous action spaces in\nmodern actor-critic architectures, intrinsically prevents the exact computation\nof a softmax. We propose to alleviate this issue by parametrizing the\n$Q$-function implicitly, as the sum of a log-policy and of a value function. We\nuse the resulting parametrization to derive a practical off-policy deep RL\nalgorithm, suitable for large action spaces, and that enforces the softmax\nrelation between the policy and the $Q$-value. We provide a theoretical\nanalysis of our algorithm: from an Approximate Dynamic Programming perspective,\nwe show its equivalence to a regularized version of value iteration, accounting\nfor both entropy and Kullback-Leibler regularization, and that enjoys\nbeneficial error propagation results.

    "abstract": "Bugs in learners' programs are often the result of fundamental\nmisconceptions. Teachers frequently face the challenge of first having to\nunderstand such bugs, and then suggest ways to fix them. In order to enable\nteachers to do so effectively and efficiently, it is desirable to support them\nin recognising and fixing bugs. Misconceptions often lead to recurring patterns\nof similar bugs, enabling automated tools to provide this support in terms of\nhints on occurrences of common bug patterns. In this paper, we investigate to\nwhat extent the hints improve the effectiveness and efficiency of teachers in\ndebugging learners' programs using a cohort of 163 primary school teachers in\ntraining, tasked to correct buggy Scratch programs, with and without hints on\nbug patterns. Our experiment suggests that automatically generated hints can\nreduce the effort of finding and fixing bugs from 8.66 to 5.24 minutes, while\nincreasing the effectiveness by 34% more correct solutions. While this\nimprovement is convincing, arguably teachers in training might first need to\nlearn debugging \"the hard way\" to not miss the opportunity to learn by relying\non tools. We therefore investigate whether the use of hints during training\naffects their ability to recognise and fix bugs without hints. Our experiment\nprovides no significant evidence that either learning to debug with hints or\nlearning to debug \"the hard way\" leads to better learning effects. Overall,\nthis suggests that bug patterns might be a useful concept to include in the\ncurriculum for teachers in training, while tool-support to recognise these\npatterns is desirable for teachers in practice.",

However, the issue of feature\nalignment remains as neglected by most existing approaches for simplicity.\nDirect pixel addition between upsampled and local features leads to feature\nmaps with misaligned contexts that, in turn, translate to mis-classifications\nin prediction, especially on object boundaries. In this paper, we propose a\nfeature alignment module that learns transformation offsets of pixels to\ncontextually align upsampled higher-level features; and another feature\nselection module to emphasize the lower-level features with rich spatial\ndetails.

    "abstract": "Unscheduled power disturbances cause severe consequences both for customers\nand grid operators. To defend against such events, it is necessary to identify\nthe causes of interruptions in the power distribution network. In this work, we\nfocus on the power grid of a Norwegian community in the Arctic that experiences\nseveral faults whose sources are unknown. First, we construct a data set\nconsisting of relevant meteorological data and information about the current\npower quality logged by power-quality meters. Then, we adopt machine-learning\ntechniques to predict the occurrence of faults. Experimental results show that\nboth linear and non-linear classifiers achieve good classification performance.\nThis indicates that the considered power-quality and weather variables explain\nwell the power disturbances. Interpreting the decision process of the\nclassifiers provides valuable insights to understand the main causes of\ndisturbances. Traditional features selection methods can only indicate which\nare the variables that, on average, mostly explain the fault occurrences in the\ndataset. Besides providing such a global interpretation, it is also important\nto identify the specific set of variables that explain each individual fault.\nTo address this challenge, we adopt a recent technique to interpret the\ndecision process of a deep learning model, called Integrated Gradients. The\nproposed approach allows to gain detailed insights on the occurrence of a\nspecific fault, which are valuable for the distribution system operators to\nimplement strategies to prevent and mitigate power disturbances.",

However, evaluating and comparing\nthese techniques is challenging as fuzzers depend on randomness when generating\ntest inputs.

First, it is unclear if the proposed guidelines are necessary due to\nthe lack of comprehensive empirical data in the case of fuzz testing. Second,\nthere does not yet exist a framework that integrates statistical evaluation\ntechniques to enable fair comparison of fuzzers. To address these limitations,\nwe introduce a novel fuzzing evaluation framework called SENF (Statistical\nEvaluatioN of Fuzzers).

    "abstract": "Semantic text matching is a critical problem in information retrieval.\nRecently, deep learning techniques have been widely used in this area and\nobtained significant performance improvements. However, most models are black\nboxes and it is hard to understand what happened in the matching process, due\nto the poor interpretability of deep learning. This paper aims at tackling this\nproblem. The key idea is to test whether existing deep text matching methods\nsatisfy some fundamental heuristics in information retrieval. Specifically,\nfour heuristics are used in our study, i.e., term frequency constraint, term\ndiscrimination constraint, length normalization constraints, and TF-length\nconstraint. Since deep matching models usually contain many parameters, it is\ndifficult to conduct a theoretical study for these complicated functions. In\nthis paper, We propose an empirical testing method. Specifically, We first\nconstruct some queries and documents to make them satisfy the assumption in a\nconstraint, and then test to which extend a deep text matching model trained on\nthe original dataset satisfies the corresponding constraint. Besides, a famous\nattribution based interpretation method, namely integrated gradient, is adopted\nto conduct detailed analysis and guide for feasible improvement. Experimental\nresults on LETOR 4.0 and MS Marco show that all the investigated deep text\nmatching methods, both representation and interaction based methods, satisfy\nthe above constraints with high probabilities in statistics. We further extend\nthese constraints to the semantic settings, which are shown to be better\nsatisfied for all the deep text matching models. These empirical findings give\nclear understandings on why deep text matching models usually perform well in\ninformation retrieval. We believe the proposed evaluation methodology will be\nuseful for testing future deep text matching models.",

We first transform the original\nfeatures of arbitrary views to a fixed number of view features, dubbed\ncanonical view representation, by aligning the arbitrary view features to a set\nof learnable reference view features using optimal transport. In this way, each\n3D shape with arbitrary views is represented by a fixed number of canonical\nview features, which are further aggregated to generate a rich and robust 3D\nshape representation for shape recognition. We also propose a canonical view\nfeature separation constraint to enforce that the view features in canonical\nview representation can be embedded into scattered points in a Euclidean space.\nExperiments on the ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and RGBD datasets show that our\nmethod achieves competitive results under the fixed viewpoint settings, and\nsignificantly outperforms the applicable methods under the arbitrary view\nsetting.",

Recently, deep unsupervised hashing\nmethods have attracted increasing attention due to the high cost of human\nannotations in the real world and the superiority of deep learning technology.\nHowever, most deep unsupervised hashing methods usually pre-compute a\nsimilarity matrix to model the pairwise relationship in the pre-trained feature\nspace. Then this similarity matrix would be used to guide hash learning, in\nwhich most of the data pairs are treated equivalently. The above process is\nconfronted with the following defects: 1) The pre-computed similarity matrix is\ninalterable and disconnected from the hash learning process, which cannot\nexplore the underlying semantic information. 2) The informative data pairs may\nbe buried by the large number of less-informative data pairs.

There exist two main challenges in the diabetes prediction\ntask: data heterogeneity since demographic and metabolic data are of different\ntypes, data insufficiency since the number of diabetes cases in a single\nmedical center is usually limited. To tackle the above challenges, we employ\ngradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) to handle data heterogeneity and\nintroduce multi-task learning (MTL) to solve data insufficiency.

    "abstract": "Block-based programming languages like Scratch have become increasingly\npopular as introductory languages for novices. These languages are intended to\nbe used with a \"tinkering\" approach which allows learners and teachers to\nquickly assemble working programs and games, but this often leads to low code\nquality. Such code can be hard to comprehend, changing it is error-prone, and\nlearners may struggle and lose interest. The general solution to improve code\nquality is to refactor the code. However, Scratch lacks many of the common\nabstraction mechanisms used when refactoring programs written in higher\nprogramming languages. In order to improve Scratch code, we therefore propose a\nset of atomic code transformations to optimise readability by (1) rewriting\ncontrol structures and (2) simplifying scripts using the inherently concurrent\nnature of Scratch programs. By automating these transformations it is possible\nto explore the space of possible variations of Scratch programs. In this paper,\nwe describe a multi-objective search-based approach that determines sequences\nof code transformations which improve the readability of a given Scratch\nprogram and therefore form refactorings. Evaluation on a random sample of 1000\nScratch programs demonstrates that the generated refactorings reduce complexity\nand entropy in 70.4% of the cases, and 354 projects are improved in at least\none metric without making any other metric worse. The refactored programs can\nhelp both novices and their teachers to improve their code.",

    "title": "Autocomplete Repetitive Stroking with Image Guidance",
    "abstract": "Image-guided drawing can compensate for the lack of skills but often requires\na significant number of repetitive strokes to create textures. Existing\nautomatic stroke synthesis methods are usually limited to predefined styles or\nrequire indirect manipulation that may break the spontaneous flow of drawing.\nWe present a method to autocomplete repetitive short strokes during users'\nnormal drawing process. Users can draw over a reference image as usual. At the\nsame time, our system silently analyzes the input strokes and the reference to\ninfer strokes that follow users' input style when certain repetition is\ndetected. Users can accept, modify, or ignore the system predictions and\ncontinue drawing, thus maintaining the fluid control of drawing. Our key idea\nis to jointly analyze image regions and operation history for detecting and\npredicting repetitions. The proposed system can effectively reduce users'\nworkload in drawing repetitive short strokes and facilitates users in creating\nresults with rich patterns.",

    "abstract": "Automatically constructing a program based on given specifications has been\nstudied for decades. Despite the advances in the field of Program Synthesis,\nthe current approaches still synthesize a block of code snippet and leave the\ntask of reusing it in an existing code base to program developers. Due to its\nprogram-wide effects, synthesizing an architectural tactic and reusing it in a\nprogram is even more challenging. Architectural tactics need to be synthesized\nbased on the context of different locations of the program, broken down to\nsmaller pieces, and added to corresponding locations in the code. Moreover,\neach piece needs to establish correct data- and control-dependencies to its\nsurrounding environment as well as to the other synthesized pieces. This is an\nerror-prone and challenging task, especially for novice program developers. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel program synthesis approach that synthesizes\narchitectural tactics and adds them to an existing code base.",

Monitoring stations have been established to continuously\nobtain air quality information, but they do not cover all areas. Thus, there\nare numerous methods for spatially fine-grained air quality inference.

In this\npaper, we first study the air quality inference in unmonitored cities. To\naccurately infer air quality in unmonitored cities, we propose a neural\nnetwork-based approach AIREX. The novelty of AIREX is employing a\nmixture-of-experts approach, which is a machine learning technique based on the\ndivide-and-conquer principle, to learn correlations of air quality between\nmultiple cities. To further boost the performance, it employs attention\nmechanisms to compute impacts of air quality inference from the monitored\ncities to the locations in the unmonitored city.

    "abstract": "The task of searching for and tracking of multiple targets is a challenging\none. However, most works in this area do not consider evasive targets that move\nfaster than the agents comprising the multi-robot system. This is due to the\nassumption that the movement patterns of such targets, combined with their\nexcessive speed, would make the task nearly impossible to accomplish. In this\nwork, we show that this is not the case and we propose a decentralized search\nand tracking strategy in which the level of exploration and exploitation\ncarried out by the swarm is adjustable. By tuning a swarm's exploration and\nexploitation dynamics, we demonstrate that there exists an optimal balance\nbetween the level of exploration and exploitation performed. This optimum\nmaximizes its tracking performance and changes depending on the number of\ntargets and the targets' movement profiles. We also show that the use of\nagent-based memory is critical in enabling the tracking of an evasive target.\nThe obtained simulation results are validated through experimental tests with a\ndecentralized swarm of six robots tracking a virtual fast-moving target.",

    "abstract": "The functional correspondence is a manual derivation technique transforming\nhigher-order evaluators into the semantically equivalent abstract machines. The\ntransformation consists of two well-known program transformations: translation\nto continuation-passing style that uncovers the control flow of the evaluator\nand Reynolds's defunctionalization that generates a first-order transition\nfunction. Ever since the transformation was first described by Danvy et al. it\nhas found numerous applications in connecting known evaluators and abstract\nmachines, but also in discovering new abstract machines for a variety of\n$\\lambda$-calculi as well as for logic-programming, imperative and\nobject-oriented languages.\nWe present an algorithm that automates the functional correspondence. The\nalgorithm accepts an evaluator written in a dedicated minimal functional\nmeta-language and it first transforms it to administrative normal form, which\nfacilitates program analysis, before performing selective translation to\ncontinuation-passing style, and selective defunctionalization. The two\nselective transformations are driven by a control-flow analysis that is\ncomputed by an abstract interpreter obtained using the abstracting abstract\nmachines methodology, which makes it possible to transform only the desired\nparts of the evaluator. The article is accompanied by an implementation of the\nalgorithm in the form of a command-line tool that allows for automatic\ntransformation of an evaluator embedded in a Racket source file and gives\nfine-grained control over the resulting machine.",

We work under the\nmost realistic settings where only partial and noisy observations of the state\nare available at runtime. Such settings directly affect the accuracy and\nreliability of the reachability predictions, jeopardizing the safety of the\nsystem. In this work, we present a learning-based method for PM that produces\naccurate and reliable reachability predictions despite partial observability\n(PO). We build on Neural Predictive Monitoring (NPM), a PM method that uses\ndeep neural networks for approximating hybrid systems reachability, and extend\nit to the PO case. We propose and compare two solutions, an end-to-end\napproach, which directly operates on the rough observations, and a two-step\napproach, which introduces an intermediate state estimation step. Both\nsolutions rely on conformal prediction to provide 1) probabilistic guarantees\nin the form of prediction regions and 2) sound estimates of predictive\nuncertainty. We use the latter to identify unreliable (and likely erroneous)\npredictions and to retrain and improve the monitors on these uncertain inputs\n(i.e., active learning).

    "abstract": "Cross-domain object detection and semantic segmentation have witnessed\nimpressive progress recently. Existing approaches mainly consider the domain\nshift resulting from external environments including the changes of background,\nillumination or weather, while distinct camera intrinsic parameters appear\ncommonly in different domains, and their influence for domain adaptation has\nbeen very rarely explored. In this paper, we observe that the Field of View\n(FoV) gap induces noticeable instance appearance differences between the source\nand target domains. We further discover that the FoV gap between two domains\nimpairs domain adaptation performance under both the FoV-increasing (source FoV\n< target FoV) and FoV-decreasing cases. Motivated by the observations, we\npropose the \\textbf{Position-Invariant Transform} (PIT) to better align images\nin different domains. We also introduce a reverse PIT for mapping the\ntransformed/aligned images back to the original image space and design a loss\nre-weighting strategy to accelerate the training process. Our method can be\neasily plugged into existing cross-domain detection/segmentation frameworks\nwhile bringing about negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method can soundly boost the performance on both\ncross-domain object detection and segmentation for state-of-the-art techniques.\nOur code is available at\nhttps://github.com/sheepooo/PIT-Position-Invariant-Transform.",

In this framework, the BS and UEs are\nreinforcement learning (RL) agents that need to learn to cooperate in order to\ndeliver data. The network nodes can exchange control messages to collaborate\nand deliver data across the network, but without any prior agreement on the\nmeaning of the control messages. In such a framework, the agents have to learn\nnot only the channel access policy, but also the signaling policy. The\ncollaboration between agents is shown to be important, by comparing the\nproposed algorithm to ablated versions where either the communication between\nagents or the central critic is removed. The comparison with a contention-free\nbaseline shows that our framework achieves a superior performance in terms of\ngoodput and can effectively be used to learn a new protocol.",

    "abstract": "Human motion prediction is a challenging task due to the stochasticity and\naperiodicity of future poses. Recently, graph convolutional network has been\nproven to be very effective to learn dynamic relations among pose joints, which\nis helpful for pose prediction. On the other hand, one can abstract a human\npose recursively to obtain a set of poses at multiple scales. With the increase\nof the abstraction level, the motion of the pose becomes more stable, which\nbenefits pose prediction too. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Scale\nResidual Graph Convolution Network (MSR-GCN) for human pose prediction task in\nthe manner of end-to-end. The GCNs are used to extract features from fine to\ncoarse scale and then from coarse to fine scale. The extracted features at each\nscale are then combined and decoded to obtain the residuals between the input\nand target poses. Intermediate supervisions are imposed on all the predicted\nposes, which enforces the network to learn more representative features. Our\nproposed approach is evaluated on two standard benchmark datasets, i.e., the\nHuman3.6M dataset and the CMU Mocap dataset.

It\nis known that listing all simplicial vertices can be done in $O(nm)$ time or\n$O(n^{\\omega})$ time, where $O(n^{\\omega})$ is the time needed to perform a\nfast matrix multiplication. The notion of avoidable vertices generalizes the\nconcept of simplicial vertices in the following way: a vertex $u$ is avoidable\nif every induced path on three vertices with middle vertex $u$ is contained in\nan induced cycle. We present algorithms for listing all avoidable vertices of a\ngraph through the notion of minimal triangulations and common neighborhood\ndetection. In particular we give algorithms with running times $O(n^{2}m)$ and\n$O(n^{1+\\omega})$, respectively.

In this paper, we\nattempt to improve self-supervised pretrained representations through the lens\nof curriculum learning by proposing a hardness-aware dynamic curriculum\nlearning (HaDCL) approach. To improve the robustness and generalizability of\nSSL, we dynamically leverage progressive harder examples via easy-to-hard and\nhard-to-very-hard samples during mini-batch downstream fine-tuning. We discover\nthat by progressive stage-wise curriculum learning, the pretrained\nrepresentations are significantly enhanced and adaptable to both in-domain and\nout-of-domain distribution data.\nWe performed extensive validation on three histology benchmark datasets on\nboth patch-wise and slide-level classification problems. Our curriculum based\nfine-tuning yields a significant improvement over standard fine-tuning, with a\nminimum improvement in area-under-the-curve (AUC) score of 1.7% and 2.2% on\nin-domain and out-of-domain distribution data, respectively.

    "title": "Real-time Human-Centric Segmentation for Complex Video Scenes",
    "abstract": "Most existing video tasks related to \"human\" focus on the segmentation of\nsalient humans, ignoring the unspecified others in the video. Few studies have\nfocused on segmenting and tracking all humans in a complex video, including\npedestrians and humans of other states (e.g., seated, riding, or occluded). In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework, abbreviated as HVISNet, that segments\nand tracks all presented people in given videos based on a one-stage detector.\nTo better evaluate complex scenes, we offer a new benchmark called HVIS (Human\nVideo Instance Segmentation), which comprises 1447 human instance masks in 805\nhigh-resolution videos in diverse scenes. Extensive experiments show that our\nproposed HVISNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy\nat a real-time inference speed (30 FPS), especially on complex video scenes. We\nalso notice that using the center of the bounding box to distinguish different\nindividuals severely deteriorates the segmentation accuracy, especially in\nheavily occluded conditions. This common phenomenon is referred to as the\nambiguous positive samples problem. To alleviate this problem, we propose a\nmechanism named Inner Center Sampling to improve the accuracy of instance\nsegmentation. Such a plug-and-play inner center sampling mechanism can be\nincorporated in any instance segmentation models based on a one-stage detector\nto improve the performance. In particular, it gains 4.1 mAP improvement on the\nstate-of-the-art method in the case of occluded humans. Code and data are\navailable at https://github.com/IIGROUP/HVISNet.",

This\nmanuscript presents a new computational approach that avoids this issue by\npre-constructing a fast direct solver for the wall ahead of time, computing a\nlow-rank factorization to capture the changes due to the refinement, and\nsolving the problem on the refined discretization via a Woodbury formula.\nNumerical results illustrate the efficiency of the solver in accelerating\nparticulate Stokes simulations.",

    "abstract": "Securing necessary resources for edge computing processes via effective\nresource trading becomes a critical technique in supporting\ncomputation-intensive mobile applications. Conventional onsite spot trading\ncould facilitate this paradigm with proper incentives, which, however, incurs\nexcessive decision-making latency/energy consumption, and further leads to\nunderutilization of dynamic resources. Motivated by this, a hybrid market\nunifying futures and spot is proposed to facilitate resource trading among an\nedge server (seller) and multiple smart devices (buyers) by encouraging some\nbuyers to sign a forward contract with seller in advance, while leaving the\nremaining buyers to compete for available resources with spot trading.\nSpecifically, overbooking is adopted to achieve substantial utilization and\nprofit advantages owing to dynamic resource demands. By integrating overbooking\ninto futures market, mutually beneficial and risk-tolerable forward contracts\nwith appropriate overbooking rate can be achieved relying on analyzing\nhistorical statistics associated with future resource demand and communication\nquality, which are determined by an alternative optimization-based negotiation\nscheme. Besides, spot trading problem is studied via considering\nuniform/differential pricing rules, for which two bilateral negotiation schemes\nare proposed by addressing both non-convex optimization and knapsack problems.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves mutually\nbeneficial players' utilities, while outperforming baseline methods on critical\nindicators, e.g., decision-making latency, resource usage, etc.",

Characterizing the robustness properties of\npatch attacks and their invariance to 3D pose is important, yet not fully\nelucidated, and is the focus of this paper.

We\nbegin by introducing three practical properties associated with the notion of\nrobustness in hierarchical clustering: linear scale preservation, stability,\nand excisiveness. Linear scale preservation enforces imperviousness to change\nin units of measure whereas stability ensures that a bounded perturbation in\nthe input network entails a bounded perturbation in the clustering output.\nExcisiveness refers to the local consistency of the clustering outcome.\nAlgorithmically, excisiveness implies that we can reduce computational\ncomplexity by only clustering a subset of our data while theoretically\nguaranteeing that the same hierarchical outcome would be observed when\nclustering the whole dataset. In parallel to these three properties, we\nintroduce the concept of representability, a generative model for describing\nclustering methods through the specification of their action on a collection of\nnetworks. Our main result is to leverage this generative model to give a\nprecise characterization of all robust -- i.e., excisive, linear scale\npreserving, and stable -- hierarchical clustering methods for directed\nnetworks.

We call these models foundation models to\nunderscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report\nprovides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation\nmodels, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics,\nreasoning, human interaction) and technical principles (e.g., model\narchitectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation,\ntheory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal\nimpact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and\nethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on conventional\ndeep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent\ncapabilities, and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes\nhomogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution,\nas the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models\ndownstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,\nwe currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and\nwhat they are even capable of due to their emergent properties.

    "abstract": "In the design of stellarators, energetic particle confinement is a critical\npoint of concern which remains challenging to study from a numerical point of\nview. Standard Monte Carlo analyses are highly expensive because a large number\nof particle trajectories need to be integrated over long time scales, and small\ntime steps must be taken to accurately capture the features of the wide variety\nof trajectories. Even when they are based on guiding center trajectories, as\nopposed to full-orbit trajectories, these standard Monte Carlo studies are too\nexpensive to be included in most stellarator optimization codes. We present the\nfirst multifidelity Monte Carlo scheme for accelerating the estimation of\nenergetic particle confinement in stellarators. Our approach relies on a\ntwo-level hierarchy, in which a guiding center model serves as the\nhigh-fidelity model, and a data-driven linear interpolant is leveraged as the\nlow-fidelity surrogate model. We apply multifidelity Monte Carlo to the study\nof energetic particle confinement in a 4-period quasi-helically symmetric\nstellarator, assessing various metrics of confinement. Stemming from the very\nhigh computational efficiency of our surrogate model as well as its sufficient\ncorrelation to the high-fidelity model, we obtain speedups of up to 10 with\nmultifidelity Monte Carlo compared to standard Monte Carlo.",

    "abstract": "While the study of graphs has been very popular, simplicial complexes are\nrelatively new in the network science community. Despite being are a source of\nrich information, graphs are limited to pairwise interactions. However, several\nreal world networks such as social networks, neuronal networks etc. involve\nsimultaneous interactions between more than two nodes. Simplicial complexes\nprovide a powerful mathematical way to model such interactions. Now, the\nspectrum of the graph Laplacian is known to be indicative of community\nstructure, with nonzero eigenvectors encoding the identity of communities.\nHere, we propose that the spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian, a higher-order\nLaplacian applied to simplicial complexes, encodes simplicial communities. We\nformulate an algorithm to extract simplicial communities (of arbitrary\ndimension). We apply this algorithm on simplicial complex benchmarks and on\nreal data including social networks and language-networks, where higher-order\nrelationships are intrinsic. Additionally, datasets for simplicial complexes\nare scarce. Hence, we introduce a method of optimally generating a simplicial\ncomplex from its network backbone through estimating the \\textit{true}\nhigher-order relationships when its community structure is known. We do so by\nusing the adjusted mutual information to identify the configuration that best\nmatches the expected data partition. Lastly, we demonstrate an example of\npersistent simplicial communities inspired by the field of persistence\nhomology.",

This\nwork explores Weakly Supervised Continual Learning (WSCL): here, only a small\nfraction of labeled input examples are shown to the learner. We assess how\ncurrent CL methods (e.g.: EWC, LwF, iCaRL, ER, GDumb, DER) perform in this\nnovel and challenging scenario, in which overfitting entangles forgetting.\nSubsequently, we design two novel WSCL methods which exploit metric learning\nand consistency regularization to leverage unsupervised data while learning.

    "abstract": "The error rates of quantum devices are orders of magnitude higher than what\nis needed to run most quantum applications. To close this gap, Quantum Error\nCorrection (QEC) encodes logical qubits and distributes information using\nseveral physical qubits. By periodically executing a syndrome extraction\ncircuit on the logical qubits, information about errors (called syndrome) is\nextracted while running programs. A decoder uses these syndromes to identify\nand correct errors in real time, which is required to use feedback implemented\nin quantum algorithms. Unfortunately, software decoders are slow and hardware\ndecoders are fast but less accurate. Thus, almost all QEC studies so far have\nrelied on offline decoding.\nTo enable real-time decoding in near-term QEC, we propose LILLIPUT-- a\nLightweight Low Latency Look-Up Table decoder. LILLIPUT consists of two parts--\nFirst, it translates syndromes into error detection events that index into a\nLook-Up Table (LUT) whose entry provides the error information in real-time.\nSecond, it programs the LUTs with error assignments for all possible error\nevents by running a software decoder offline. LILLIPUT tolerates an error on\nany operation in the quantum hardware, including gates and measurement, and the\nnumber of tolerated errors grows with the size of the code. It needs <7% logic\non off-the-shelf FPGAs that allows it to be easily integrated alongside the\ncontrol and readout circuits in existing systems. LILLIPUT incurs a latency of\nfew nanoseconds and enables real-time decoding. We also propose Compressed LUTs\n(CLUTs) to reduce the memory needed by LILLIPUT. By exploiting the fact that\nnot all error events are equally likely and only storing data for the most\nprobable error events, CLUTs reduce the memory needed by up-to 107x (from 148\nMB to 1.38 MB) without degrading accuracy.",

However,\nproviding the exact ETA during congestion is a challenge owing to the complex\npropagation process between roads and high uncertainty regarding the future\nbehavior of the process. Recent studies have focused on finding frequent\ncongestion propagation patterns and determining the propagation probabilities.\nBy contrast, this study proposes a novel time delay estimation method for\ntraffic congestion propagation between roads using lag-specific transfer\nentropy (TE). Nonlinear normalization with a sliding window is used to\neffectively reveal the causal relationship between the source and target time\nseries in calculating the TE. Moreover, Markov bootstrap techniques were\nadopted to quantify the uncertainty in the time delay estimator. To the best of\nour knowledge, the time delay estimation method presented in this article is\nthe first to determine the time delay between roads for any congestion\npropagation pattern.

Firstly, a prioritized experience replay automated reinforcement\nlearning (PER-AutoRL) is designed to simplify the deployment of deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL)-based forecasting model in a customized manner,\nthe single-step multi-period forecasting method based on PER-AutoRL is proposed\nfor the first time to address the error accumulation issue suffered by existing\nmulti-step forecasting methods, then the prediction values obtained by the\nproposed forecasting method are revised via the error distribution to improve\nthe prediction accuracy; secondly, a scheduling model considering demand\nresponse is constructed to minimize the total microgrid operating costs, where\nthe revised forecasting values are used as the dispatch basis, and a spinning\nreserve chance constraint is set according to the error distribution; finally,\nby transforming the original scheduling model into a readily solvable mixed\ninteger linear programming via the sequence operation theory (SOT), the\ntransformed model is solved by using CPLEX solver. The simulation results show\nthat compared with the traditional scheduling model without forecasting, this\napproach manages to significantly reduce the system operating costs by\nimproving the prediction accuracy.",

    "title": "The Proximal ID Algorithm",
    "abstract": "Unobserved confounding is a fundamental obstacle to establishing valid causal\nconclusions from observational data. Two complementary types of approaches have\nbeen developed to address this obstacle. An extensive line of work is based on\ntaking advantage of fortuitous external aids (such as the presence of an\ninstrumental variable or other proxy), along with additional assumptions to\nensure identification. A recent line of work of proximal causal inference (Miao\net al., 2018a) has aimed to provide a novel approach to using proxies to deal\nwith unobserved confounding without relying on stringent parametric\nassumptions. On the other hand, a complete characterization of identifiability\nof a large class of causal parameters in arbitrary causal models with hidden\nvariables has been developed using the language of graphical models, resulting\nin the ID algorithm and related extensions (Tian and Pearl, 2002; Shpitser and\nPearl, 2006a,b). Celebrated special cases of this approach, such as the\nfront-door model, are able to obtain non-parametric identification in seemingly\ncounter-intuitive situations when a treatment and an outcome share an\narbitrarily complicated unobserved common cause.\nIn this paper we aim to develop a synthesis of the proximal and graphical\napproaches to identification in causal inference to yield the most general\nidentification algorithm in multi- variate systems currently known - the\nproximal ID algorithm. In addition to being able to obtain non-parametric\nidentification in all cases where the ID algorithm succeeds, our approach\nallows us to systematically exploit proxies to adjust for the presence of\nunobserved confounders that would have otherwise prevented identification.\nIn addition, we outline a class of estimation strategies for causal\nparameters identified by our method in an important special case. We\nillustration our approach by simulation studies.",

    "abstract": "Most research in quantum computing today is performed against simulations of\nquantum computers rather than true quantum computers. Simulating a quantum\ncomputer entails implementing all of the unitary operators corresponding to the\nquantum gates as tensors. For high numbers of qubits, performing tensor\nmultiplications for these simulations becomes quite expensive, since $N$-qubit\ngates correspond to $2^{N}$-dimensional tensors. One way to accelerate such a\nsimulation is to use field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware to\nefficiently compute the matrix multiplications. Though FPGAs can efficiently\nperform tensor multiplications, they are memory bound, having relatively small\nblock random access memory. One way to potentially reduce the memory footprint\nof a quantum computing system is to represent it as a tensor network; tensor\nnetworks are a formalism for representing compositions of tensors wherein\neconomical tensor contractions are readily identified. Thus we explore tensor\nnetworks as a means to reducing the memory footprint of quantum computing\nsystems and broadly accelerating simulations of such systems.",

    "abstract": "Localization is important for a large number of Internet of Things (IoT)\nendpoint devices connected by LoRaWAN. Due to the bandwidth limitations of\nLoRaWAN, existing localization methods without specialized hardware (e.g., GPS)\nproduce poor performance. To increase the localization accuracy, we propose a\nsuper-resolution localization method, called Seirios, which features a novel\nalgorithm to synchronize multiple non-overlapped communication channels by\nexploiting the unique features of the radio physical layer to increase the\noverall bandwidth. By exploiting both the original and the conjugate of the\nphysical layer, Seirios can resolve the direct path from multiple reflectors in\nboth indoor and outdoor environments. We design a Seirios prototype and\nevaluate its performance in an outdoor area of 100 m $\\times$ 60 m, and an\nindoor area of 25 m $\\times$ 15 m, which shows that Seirios can achieve a\nmedian error of 4.4 m outdoors (80% samples < 6.4 m), and 2.4 m indoors (80%\nsamples < 6.1 m), respectively. The results show that Seirios produces 42% less\nlocalization error than the baseline approach. Our evaluation also shows that,\ndifferent to previous studies in Wi-Fi localization systems that have wider\nbandwidth, time-of-fight (ToF) estimation is less effective for LoRaWAN\nlocalization systems with narrowband radio signals.",

Acoustic features measuring vowel articulation have been\ndemonstrated to be effective indicators of PD in its assessment. Standard\nclinical vowel articulation features of vowel working space area (VSA), vowel\narticulation index (VAI) and formants centralization ratio (FCR), are derived\nthe first two formants of the three corner vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/.\nConventionally, manual annotation of the corner vowels from speech data is\nrequired before measuring vowel articulation. This process is time-consuming.\nThe present work aims to reduce human effort in clinical analysis of PD speech\nby proposing an automatic pipeline for vowel articulation assessment. The\nmethod is based on automatic corner vowel detection using a language universal\nphoneme recognizer, followed by statistical analysis of the formant data. The\napproach removes the restrictions of prior knowledge of speaking content and\nthe language in question. Experimental results on a Finnish PD speech corpus\ndemonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed automatic method in\nderiving VAI, VSA, FCR and F2i/F2u (the second formant ratio for vowels /i/ and\n/u/). The automatically computed parameters are shown to be highly correlated\nwith features computed with manual annotations of corner vowels. In addition,\nautomatically and manually computed vowel articulation features have comparable\ncorrelations with experts' ratings on speech intelligibility, voice impairment\nand overall severity of communication disorder.

However,\nit is still unclear how the RS affects spatiotemporal calibration of the camera\nin a sensor assembly, which is crucial to good performance in aforementioned\napplications.\nThis work takes the camera-IMU system as an example and looks into the RS\neffect on its spatiotemporal calibration. To this end, we develop a calibration\nmethod for a RS-camera-IMU system with continuous-time B-splines by using a\ncalibration target. Unlike in calibrating GS cameras, every observation of a\nlandmark on the target has a unique camera pose fitted by continuous-time\nB-splines. With simulated data generated from four sets of public calibration\ndata, we show that RS can noticeably affect the extrinsic parameters, causing\nerrors about 1$^\\circ$ in orientation and 2 $cm$ in translation with a RS\nsetting as in common smartphone cameras. With real data collected by two\nindustrial camera-IMU systems, we find that considering the RS effect gives\nmore accurate and consistent spatiotemporal calibration.

    "title": "Variational Inference at Glacier Scale",
    "abstract": "We characterize the complete joint posterior distribution over\nspatially-varying basal traction and and ice softness parameters of an ice\nsheet model from observations of surface speed by using stochastic variational\ninference combined with natural gradient descent to find an approximating\nvariational distribution. By placing a Gaussian process prior over the\nparameters and casting the problem in terms of eigenfunctions of a kernel, we\ngain substantial control over prior assumptions on parameter smoothness and\nlength scale, while also rendering the inference tractable. In a synthetic\nexample, we find that this method recovers known parameters and accounts for\nmutual indeterminacy, both of which can influence observed surface speed. In an\napplication to Helheim Glacier in Southeast Greenland, we show that our method\nscales to glacier-sized problems. We find that posterior uncertainty in regions\nof slow flow is high regardless of the choice of observational noise model.",
