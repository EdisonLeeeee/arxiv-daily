    "title": "Hierarchical Power Flow Control in Smart Grids: Enhancing Rotor Angle  and Frequency Stability with Demand-Side Flexibility",
    "abstract": "Large-scale integration of renewables in power systems gives rise to new\nchallenges for keeping synchronization and frequency stability in volatile and\nuncertain power flow states. To ensure the safety of operation, the system must\nmaintain adequate disturbance rejection capability at the time scales of both\nrotor angle and system frequency dynamics. This calls for flexibility to be\nexploited on both the generation and demand sides, compensating volatility and\nensuring stability at the two separate time scales. This article proposes a\nhierarchical power flow control architecture that involves both transmission\nand distribution networks as well as individual buildings to enhance both\nsmall-signal rotor angle stability and frequency stability of the transmission\nnetwork. The proposed architecture consists of a transmission-level optimizer\nenhancing system damping ratios, a distribution-level controller following\ntransmission commands and providing frequency support, and a building-level\nscheduler accounting for quality of service and following the\ndistribution-level targets. We validate the feasibility and performance of the\nwhole control architecture through real-time hardware-in-loop tests involving\nreal-world transmission and distribution network models along with real devices\nat the Stone Edge Farm Microgrid.",

We use\nKripke structures to represent the high-level decision-making of the agent\nunder test and the abstraction of the test environment.

Second, we formulate the\nproblem of test graph synthesis to find a test configuration for which the\nagent must satisfy the test specification to satisfy its mission objectives. We\nan algorithm, based on network flows, for synthesizing a test graph by\nrestricting transitions, represented by edge deletions, on the original graph\ninduced by the Kripke structures. The algorithm synthesizes the test graph\niteratively using an integer linear program. We prove completeness for our\nalgorithm, and we show that the edge deletions in each iteration maintain\nfeasibility of the integer linear program in the subsequent iteration. We\nformalize the notion of a minimally constrained test graph in terms of maximum\nflow, and prove the synthesized test graph to be minimally constrained.

    "abstract": "We introduce the problem of finding a satisfying assignment to a CNF formula\nthat must further belong to a prescribed input subspace. Equivalent\nformulations of the problem include finding a point outside a union of\nsubspaces (the Union-of-Subspace Avoidance (USA) problem), and finding a common\nzero of a system of polynomials over $\\F_2$ each of which is a product of\naffine forms.\nWe focus on the case of k-CNF formulas (the k-SUB-SAT problem). Clearly, it\nis no easier than k-SAT, and might be harder. Indeed, via simple reductions we\nshow NP-hardness for k=2 and W[1]-hardness parameterized by the co-dimension of\nthe subspace. We also prove that the optimization version Max-2-SUB-SAT is\nNP-hard to approximate better than the trivial 3/4 ratio even on satisfiable\ninstances.\nOn the algorithmic front, we investigate fast exponential algorithms which\ngive non-trivial savings over brute-force algorithms. We give a simple\nbranching algorithm with runtime 1.5^r for 2-SUB-SAT, where $r$ is the subspace\ndimension and an O^*(1.4312)^n time algorithm where $n$ is the number of\nvariables.\nFor k more than 2, while known algorithms for solving a system of degree $k$\npolynomial equations already imply a solution with runtime 2^{r(1-1/2k)}, we\nexplore a more combinatorial approach. For instance, based on the notion of\ncritical variables, we give an algorithm with running time ${n\\choose {\\le t}}\n2^{n-n/k}$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $t$ is the co-dimension of\nthe subspace. This improves upon the running time of the polynomial equations\napproach for small co-dimension. Our algorithm also achieves polynomial space\nin contrast to the algebraic approach that uses exponential space.",

The dataset is\ncollected from a Twitter archive and pre-classified by a machine learning\nsystem. HASOC has two sub-task for all three languages: task A is a binary\nclassification problem (Hate and Not Offensive) while task B is a fine-grained\nclassification problem for three classes (HATE) Hate speech, OFFENSIVE and\nPROFANITY. Overall, 252 runs were submitted by 40 teams. The performance of the\nbest classification algorithms for task A are F1 measures of 0.51, 0.53 and\n0.52 for English, Hindi, and German, respectively. For task B, the best\nclassification algorithms achieved F1 measures of 0.26, 0.33 and 0.29 for\nEnglish, Hindi, and German, respectively.

For an arbitrary manifold, there is no smooth global\ncoordinate representation, so following the formalism of differential topology\nwe represent the manifold as an atlas of charts. We first partition the data\ninto overlapping regions. Then undercomplete autoencoders are used to find\nlow-dimensional coordinate representations for each region. We then use the\ndata to learn dynamical models in each region, which together yield a global\nlow-dimensional dynamical model. We apply this method to examples ranging from\nsimple periodic dynamics to complex, nominally high-dimensional non-periodic\nbursting dynamics of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. We demonstrate that it:\n(1) can yield dynamical models of the lowest possible dimension, where previous\nmethods generally cannot; (2) exhibits computational benefits including\nscalability, parallelizability, and adaptivity; and (3) separates state space\ninto regions of distinct behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Ocean current, fluid mechanics, and many other spatio-temporal physical\ndynamical systems are essential components of the universe. One key\ncharacteristic of such systems is that certain physics laws -- represented as\nordinary/partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs) -- largely dominate the\nwhole process, irrespective of time or location. Physics-informed learning has\nrecently emerged to learn physics for accurate prediction, but they often lack\na mechanism to leverage localized spatial and temporal correlation or rely on\nhard-coded physics parameters. In this paper, we advocate a physics-coupled\nneural network model to learn parameters governing the physics of the system,\nand further couple the learned physics to assist the learning of recurring\ndynamics. A spatio-temporal physics-coupled neural network (ST-PCNN) model is\nproposed to achieve three goals: (1) learning the underlying physics\nparameters, (2) transition of local information between spatio-temporal\nregions, and (3) forecasting future values for the dynamical system. The\nphysics-coupled learning ensures that the proposed model can be tremendously\nimproved by using learned physics parameters, and can achieve good long-range\nforecasting (e.g., more than 30-steps). Experiments, using simulated and\nfield-collected ocean current data, validate that ST-PCNN outperforms existing\nphysics-informed models.",

We\nmaintain that although both its first principles and its conclusions drawn from\nthe research conducted by the PBOC from 2014 to date are broadly reasonable and\nappropriate, the PBOC has also missed some important considerations and\nentertained some questionable assumptions, which many central banks around the\nworld have also done.

A current limitation of CAD\nprograms (even those that are specifically designed for educational purposes)\nis that they are not capable of providing automated real-time help to students.\nTo encourage CAD programs to build in assistance to students, we used data\ngenerated from students using a free, open source CAD software called Aladdin\nto demonstrate how student data combined with machine learning techniques can\npredict how well a particular student will perform in a design task. We\nchallenged students to design a house that consumed zero net energy as part of\nan introductory engineering technology undergraduate course. Using data from\n128 students, along with the scikit-learn Python machine learning library, we\ntested our models using both total counts of design actions and sequences of\ndesign actions as inputs. We found that our models using early design sequence\nactions are particularly valuable for prediction. Our logistic regression model\nachieved a >60% chance of predicting if a student would succeed in designing a\nzero net energy house.

While remaining as\none of the most popular optimization methods, its capability is hindered by the\nsize of data, the dimensionality of the considered problem, and the nature of\nsequential optimization. These scalability issues are intertwined with each\nother and must be tackled simultaneously. In this work, we propose the\nScalable$^3$-BO framework, which employs sparse GP as the underlying surrogate\nmodel to scope with Big Data and is equipped with a random embedding to\nefficiently optimize high-dimensional problems with low effective\ndimensionality. The Scalable$^3$-BO framework is further leveraged with\nasynchronous parallelization feature, which fully exploits the computational\nresource on HPC within a computational budget. As a result, the proposed\nScalable$^3$-BO framework is scalable in three independent perspectives: with\nrespect to data size, dimensionality, and computational resource on HPC. The\ngoal of this work is to push the frontiers of BO beyond its well-known\nscalability issues and minimize the wall-clock waiting time for optimizing\nhigh-dimensional computationally expensive applications.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer the knowledge learnt\nfrom a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous work is\nmainly built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn\ndomain-invariant representations. With the recent exponential increase in\napplying Vision Transformer (ViT) to vision tasks, the capability of ViT in\nadapting cross-domain knowledge, however, remains unexplored in the literature.\nTo fill this gap, this paper first comprehensively investigates the\ntransferability of ViT on a variety of domain adaptation tasks. Surprisingly,\nViT demonstrates superior transferability over its CNNs-based counterparts with\na large margin, while the performance can be further improved by incorporating\nadversarial adaptation. Notwithstanding, directly using CNNs-based adaptation\nstrategies fails to take the advantage of ViT's intrinsic merits (e.g.,\nattention mechanism and sequential image representation) which play an\nimportant role in knowledge transfer. To remedy this, we propose an unified\nframework, namely Transferable Vision Transformer (TVT), to fully exploit the\ntransferability of ViT for domain adaptation. Specifically, we delicately\ndevise a novel and effective unit, which we term Transferability Adaption\nModule (TAM). By injecting learned transferabilities into attention blocks, TAM\ncompels ViT focus on both transferable and discriminative features. Besides, we\nleverage discriminative clustering to enhance feature diversity and separation\nwhich are undermined during adversarial domain alignment. To verify its\nversatility, we perform extensive studies of TVT on four benchmarks and the\nexperimental results demonstrate that TVT attains significant improvements\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art UDA methods.",

By solving the associated\ndiscounted cost problem and analyzing the Markov chain under the optimal\npolicy, we prove that there exists a threshold optimal stationary policy with\nonly two thresholds, i.e., one threshold on the AoI at the transmitter (AoIT)\nand the other on the AoI at the receiver (AoIR). Moreover, the two thresholds\ncan be efficiently found by a line search. Numerical results show the\nperformance of the optimal policies and the tradeoff curves with different\nparameters. Comparisons with the conventional policies show that considering\nsensing energy is of significant impact on the policy design, and introducing\nsleep mode greatly expands the tradeoff range.",

    "abstract": "Real-time detection and tracking of fast-moving objects have achieved great\nsuccess in various fields. However, many existing methods, especially low-cost\nones, are difficult to achieve real-time and long-term object detection and\ntracking. Here, a non-imaging strategy is proposed, including two stages, to\nrealize fast-moving object detection and tracking in real-time and for the long\nterm: 1) a contour-moments-based method is proposed to optimize the Hadamard\npattern sequence. And then reconstructing projection curves of the object based\non single-pixel imaging technology. The projection curve, which including the\nobject location information, is reconstructed directly with the measurements\ncollected by a single-pixel detector; 2) The fastest changing position in the\nprojection curve can be obtained by solving first-order gradients. A gradient\ndifferential is used in two first-order gradients to calculate a differential\ncurve with the sudden change positions. Finally, we can obtain the boundary\ninformation of the fast-moving object. We experimentally demonstrate that our\napproach can achieve a temporal resolution of 105 frames per second at a 1.28%\nsampling rate by using a 22,000 Hz digital micro-mirror device. The detection\nand tracking algorithm of the proposed strategy is computationally efficient.\nCompared with the state-of-the-art methods, our approach can make the sampling\nrate lower. Additionally, the strategy acquires not more than 1MB of data for\neach frame, which is capable of fast-moving object real-time and long-term\ndetection and tracking.",

    "abstract": "While deep neural networks have shown impressive performance in many tasks,\nthey are fragile to carefully designed adversarial attacks. We propose a novel\nadversarial training-based model by Attention Guided Knowledge Distillation and\nBi-directional Metric Learning (AGKD-BML). The attention knowledge is obtained\nfrom a weight-fixed model trained on a clean dataset, referred to as a teacher\nmodel, and transferred to a model that is under training on adversarial\nexamples (AEs), referred to as a student model. In this way, the student model\nis able to focus on the correct region, as well as correcting the intermediate\nfeatures corrupted by AEs to eventually improve the model accuracy. Moreover,\nto efficiently regularize the representation in feature space, we propose a\nbidirectional metric learning. Specifically, given a clean image, it is first\nattacked to its most confusing class to get the forward AE. A clean image in\nthe most confusing class is then randomly picked and attacked back to the\noriginal class to get the backward AE. A triplet loss is then used to shorten\nthe representation distance between original image and its AE, while enlarge\nthat between the forward and backward AEs. We conduct extensive adversarial\nrobustness experiments on two widely used datasets with different attacks. Our\nproposed AGKD-BML model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art\napproaches.

A distinct characteristic in vehicle tracking is that the trajectories\nof vehicles are fairly smooth in both the world coordinate and the image\ncoordinate.

However, tracking with the standalone motion-based trackers is quite\nchallenging because targets could get lost easily due to limited information,\ndetection error and occlusion. Leveraging appearance information to assist\nobject re-identification could resolve this challenge to some extent. However,\ndoing so requires extra computation while appearance information is sensitive\nto occlusion as well.

We model the flows' long-run guarantees as worst-case services that map\neach arrival vector recording a flow's cumulative task arrivals to a worst-case\nacceptable departure vector lower-bounding its cumulative task departures. We\nshow that these services are states that can be updated as tasks arrive and\ndepart, introduce state-based scheduling, and find the schedulability condition\nthat must be preserved to maintain all flows' long-run guarantees. We then use\nthis condition to identify, in each slot, all short-run scheduling decisions\nthat preserve schedulability. To illustrate how scheduling complexity can be\nreduced, we additionally show that special schedules can be efficiently\nidentified by maximizing the server's capacity slack, and that special services\ncan be efficiently specified and updated using properties of the min-plus\nalgebra.",

The data-driven methods have a stronger prior knowledge\nlearning capability for huge data, especially for nonlinear statistical\nfeatures; however, the interpretability of the networks is poor, and they are\nover-dependent on training data. In this paper, we systematically investigate\nthe coupling of model-driven and data-driven methods, which has rarely been\nconsidered in the remote sensing image restoration and fusion communities. We\nare the first to summarize the coupling approaches into the following three\ncategories: 1) data-driven and model-driven cascading methods; 2) variational\nmodels with embedded learning; and 3) model-constrained network learning\nmethods.

Therefore, we\npresent a novel 3D Transformer, called Point-Voxel Transformer (PVT) that\nleverages self-attention computation in points to gather global context\nfeatures, while performing multi-head self-attention (MSA) computation in\nvoxels to capture local information and reduce the irregular data access.\nAdditionally, to further reduce the cost of MSA computation, we design a cyclic\nshifted boxing scheme which brings greater efficiency by limiting the MSA\ncomputation to non-overlapping local boxes while also preserving cross-box\nconnection. Our method fully exploits the potentials of Transformer\narchitecture, paving the road to efficient and accurate recognition results.\nEvaluated on classification and segmentation benchmarks, our PVT not only\nachieves strong accuracy but outperforms previous state-of-the-art\nTransformer-based models with 9x measured speedup on average.

There is an increasing need to detect similar code for vulnerability\nsearch across architectures with the increase of critical vulnerabilities in\nIoT devices. The variety of IoT hardware architectures and software platforms\nrequires to capture semantic equivalence of code fragments in the similarity\ndetection. However, existing approaches are insufficient in capturing the\nsemantic similarity. We notice that the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a\nfunction contains rich semantic information. Inspired by successful\napplications of natural language processing technologies in sentence semantic\nunderstanding, we propose a deep learning-based AST-encoding method, named\nASTERIA, to measure the semantic equivalence of functions in different\nplatforms. Our method leverages the Tree-LSTM network to learn the semantic\nrepresentation of a function from its AST.

The Tree-LSTM model is trained on a dataset with 1,022,616 function\npairs and evaluated on a dataset with 95,078 function pairs. Evaluation results\nshow that our method outperforms the AST-based tool Diaphora and\nthe-state-of-art method Gemini by large margins with respect to the binary\nsimilarity detection.

Despite showing great results, this\ngenerates two training efficiency challenges. First, training large corpora can\nbe extremely timing consuming, and how to present training samples to the model\nto improve the token-wise convergence speed remains a challenging and open\nquestion. Second, many of these large models have to be trained with hundreds\nor even thousands of processors using data-parallelism with a very large batch\nsize. Despite of its better compute efficiency, it has been observed that\nlarge-batch training often runs into training instability issue or converges to\nsolutions with bad generalization performance. To overcome these two\nchallenges, we present a study of a curriculum learning based approach, which\nhelps improves the pre-training convergence speed of autoregressive models.\nMore importantly, we find that curriculum learning, as a regularization method,\nexerts a gradient variance reduction effect and enables to train autoregressive\nmodels with much larger batch sizes and learning rates without training\ninstability, further improving the training speed. Our evaluations demonstrate\nthat curriculum learning enables training GPT-2 models (with up to 1.5B\nparameters) with 8x larger batch size and 4x larger learning rate, whereas the\nbaseline approach struggles with training divergence. To achieve the same\nvalidation perplexity targets during pre-training, curriculum learning reduces\nthe required number of tokens and wall clock time by up to 59% and 54%,\nrespectively. To achieve the same or better zero-shot WikiText-103/LAMBADA\nevaluation results at the end of pre-training, curriculum learning reduces the\nrequired number of tokens and wall clock time by up to 13% and 61%,\nrespectively.",

We also extend our method to a\npersonalized FL application, pFedPara, which separates parameters into global\nand local ones. We show that pFedPara outperforms competing personalized FL\nmethods with more than three times fewer parameters.",

    "abstract": "Semantic change detection (SCD) extends the change detection (CD) task to\nprovide not only the change locations but also the detailed semantic categories\n(before and after the observation intervals). This fine-grained change\ninformation is more useful in land-cover/land-use (LC/LU) applications. Recent\nstudies indicate that the SCD can be modeled through a triple-branch\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN), which contains two temporal branches and a\nchange branch. However, in this architecture, the connections between the\ntemporal branches and the change branch are weak. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel CNN architecture for the SCD, where the\ntemporal features are re-used and are deeply merged in the temporal branch.\nFurthermore, we elaborate on this architecture to model the bi-temporal\nsemantic correlations. The resulting Bi-temporal Semantic Reasoning Network\n(Bi-SRNet) contains two types of semantic reasoning blocks to reason both\nsingle-temporal and cross-temporal semantic correlations, as well as a novel\nloss function to improve the semantic consistency of change detection results.\nExperimental results on a benchmark dataset show that the proposed architecture\nobtains significant accuracy improvements over the existing approaches, while\nthe added designs in the Bi-SRNet further improves the segmentation of both\nsemantic categories and the changed areas.

Directly transferring these trained policies\nto real environments can be extremely challenging or even dangerous. We tackle\nthis problem with a hierarchical navigation method composed of four decoupled\nmodules. The first module maintains an obstacle map during robot navigation.\nThe second one predicts a long-term goal on the real-time map periodically. The\nthird one plans collision-free command sets for navigating to long-term goals,\nwhile the final module stops the robot properly near the goal image. The four\nmodules are developed separately to suit the image-goal navigation in real\ncrowded scenarios. In addition, the hierarchical decomposition decouples the\nlearning of navigation goal planning, collision avoidance and navigation ending\nprediction, which cuts down the search space during navigation training and\nhelps improve the generalization to previously unseen real scenes. We evaluate\nthe method in both a simulator and the real world with a mobile robot.

As the existing distributed power method is\nusually sequentially updating the eigenvectors, it exhibits two obvious\ndisadvantages: 1) when it calculates the $h$th eigenvector, it needs to wait\nfor the results of previous $(h-1)$ eigenvectors, which causes a delay in\nacquiring all the eigenvalues; 2) when calculating each eigenvector, it needs a\ncertain cost of information exchange within the neighboring nodes for every\npower iteration, which could be unbearable when the number of eigenvectors or\nthe number of nodes is large. This motivates us to propose a parallel\ndistributed power method, which simultaneously calculates all the eigenvectors\nat each power iteration to ensure that more information could be exchanged in\none shaking-hand of communication. We are particularly interested in the\ndistributed power method for both an eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) and a\nsingular value decomposition (SVD), wherein the distributed process is proceed\nbased on a gossip algorithm. It can be shown that, under the same condition,\nthe communication cost of the gossip-based parallel method is only $1/H$ times\nof that for the sequential counterpart, where $H$ is the number of eigenvectors\nwe want to compute, while the convergence time and error performance of the\nproposed parallel method are both comparable to those of its sequential\ncounterpart.",

Both time division multiple access\n(TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes are considered for\nuplink (UL) offloading. Given the capability of IRSs in intelligently\nreconfiguring wireless channels over time, it is fundamentally unknown which\nmultiple access scheme is superior for MEC UL offloading. To answer this\nquestion, we first investigate the impact of three different dynamic IRS\nbeamforming (DIBF) schemes on the computation rate of both offloading schemes,\nbased on the flexibility for the IRS in adjusting its beamforming (BF) vector\nin each transmission frame. Under the DIBF framework, computation rate\nmaximization problems are formulated for both the NOMA and TDMA schemes,\nrespectively, by jointly optimizing the IRS passive BF and the resource\nallocation. We rigorously prove that offloading adopting TDMA can achieve the\nsame computation rate as that of NOMA, when all the devices share the same IRS\nBF vector during the UL offloading. By contrast, offloading exploiting TDMA\noutperforms NOMA, when the IRS BF vector can be flexibly adapted for UL\noffloading. Despite the non-convexity of the computation rate maximization\nproblems for each DIBF scheme associated with highly coupled optimization\nvariables, we conceive computationally efficient algorithms by invoking\nalternating optimization.

To fully harness the power of deep leaning for the IoT,\nthese technologies must ultimately be brought directly to the edge. The obvious\nchallenge is that deep learning techniques can only be implemented on strictly\nresource-constrained edge devices if the models are radically downsized. This\ntask relies on different model compression techniques, such as network pruning,\nquantization and the recent advancement of XNOR-Net. This paper examines the\nsuitability of these techniques for audio classification in microcontrollers.\nWe present an XNOR-Net for end-to-end raw audio classification and a\ncomprehensive empirical study comparing this approach with\npruning-and-quantization methods. We show that raw audio classification with\nXNOR yields comparable performance to regular full precision networks for small\nnumbers of classes while reducing memory requirements 32-fold and computation\nrequirements 58-fold. However, as the number of classes increases\nsignificantly, performance degrades and pruning-and-quantization based\ncompression techniques take over as the preferred technique being able to\nsatisfy the same space constraints but requiring about 8x more computation. We\nshow that these insights are consistent between raw audio classification and\nimage classification using standard benchmark sets.To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study applying XNOR to end-to-end audio\nclassification and evaluating it in the context of alternative techniques.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables a learning machine to adapt from\na labeled source domain to an unlabeled domain under the distribution shift.\nThanks to the strong representation ability of deep neural networks, recent\nremarkable achievements in UDA resort to learning domain-invariant features.\nIntuitively, the hope is that a good feature representation, together with the\nhypothesis learned from the source domain, can generalize well to the target\ndomain. However, the learning processes of domain-invariant features and source\nhypothesis inevitably involve domain-specific information that would degrade\nthe generalizability of UDA models on the target domain. In this paper,\nmotivated by the lottery ticket hypothesis that only partial parameters are\nessential for generalization, we find that only partial parameters are\nessential for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in\nUDA. Such parameters are termed transferable parameters. In contrast, the other\nparameters tend to fit domain-specific details and often fail to generalize,\nwhich we term as untransferable parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose\nTransferable Parameter Learning (TransPar) to reduce the side effect brought by\ndomain-specific information in the learning process and thus enhance the\nmemorization of domain-invariant information. Specifically, according to the\ndistribution discrepancy degree, we divide all parameters into transferable and\nuntransferable ones in each training iteration. We then perform separate\nupdates rules for the two types of parameters. Extensive experiments on image\nclassification and regression tasks (keypoint detection) show that TransPar\noutperforms prior arts by non-trivial margins. Moreover, experiments\ndemonstrate that TransPar can be integrated into the most popular deep UDA\nnetworks and be easily extended to handle any data distribution shift\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "A reliable quality assessment procedure for pansharpening methods is of\ncritical importance for the development of the related solutions.\nUnfortunately, the lack of ground-truths to be used as guidance for an\nobjective evaluation has pushed the community to resort to either\nreference-based reduced-resolution indexes or to no-reference subjective\nquality indexes that can be applied on full-resolution datasets. In particular,\nthe reference-based approach leverages on Wald's protocol, a resolution\ndegradation process that allows one to synthesize data with related ground\ntruth. Both solutions, however, present critical shortcomings that we aim to\nmitigate in this work by means of an alternative no-reference full-resolution\nframework. On one side we introduce a protocol, namely the reprojection\nprotocol, which allows to handle the spectral fidelity problem. On the other\nside, a new index of the spatial consistency between the pansharpened image and\nthe panchromatic band at full resolution is proposed. The experimental results\nshow the effectiveness of the proposed approach which is confirmed also by\nvisual inspection.",

    "abstract": "The recently-developed DETR approach applies the transformer encoder and\ndecoder architecture to object detection and achieves promising performance. In\nthis paper, we handle the critical issue, slow training convergence, and\npresent a conditional cross-attention mechanism for fast DETR training. Our\napproach is motivated by that the cross-attention in DETR relies highly on the\ncontent embeddings for localizing the four extremities and predicting the box,\nwhich increases the need for high-quality content embeddings and thus the\ntraining difficulty. Our approach, named conditional DETR, learns a conditional\nspatial query from the decoder embedding for decoder multi-head\ncross-attention. The benefit is that through the conditional spatial query,\neach cross-attention head is able to attend to a band containing a distinct\nregion, e.g., one object extremity or a region inside the object box. This\nnarrows down the spatial range for localizing the distinct regions for object\nclassification and box regression, thus relaxing the dependence on the content\nembeddings and easing the training. Empirical results show that conditional\nDETR converges 6.7x faster for the backbones R50 and R101 and 10x faster for\nstronger backbones DC5-R50 and DC5-R101.

    "abstract": "The goals of this research were to search for Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) architectures, suitable for an on-device processor with limited computing\nresources, performing at substantially lower Network Architecture Search (NAS)\ncosts. A new algorithm entitled an Early Exit Population Initialisation (EE-PI)\nfor Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) was developed to achieve both goals. The EE-PI\nreduces the total number of parameters in the search process by filtering the\nmodels with fewer parameters than the maximum threshold. It will look for a new\nmodel to replace those models with parameters more than the threshold. Thereby,\nreducing the number of parameters, memory usage for model storage and\nprocessing time while maintaining the same performance or accuracy. The search\ntime was reduced to 0.52 GPU day. This is a huge and significant achievement\ncompared to the NAS of 4 GPU days achieved using NSGA-Net, 3,150 GPU days by\nthe AmoebaNet model, and the 2,000 GPU days by the NASNet model. As well, Early\nExit Evolutionary Algorithm networks (EEEA-Nets) yield network architectures\nwith minimal error and computational cost suitable for a given dataset as a\nclass of network algorithms. Using EEEA-Net on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and\nImageNet datasets, our experiments showed that EEEA-Net achieved the lowest\nerror rate among state-of-the-art NAS models, with 2.46% for CIFAR-10, 15.02%\nfor CIFAR-100, and 23.8% for ImageNet dataset. Further, we implemented this\nimage recognition architecture for other tasks, such as object detection,\nsemantic segmentation, and keypoint detection tasks, and, in our experiments,\nEEEA-Net-C2 outperformed MobileNet-V3 on all of these various tasks.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have proven effective in robot\nnavigation, especially in unknown environments, through directly mapping\nperception inputs into robot control commands. Most existing methods adopt\nuniform execution duration with robots taking commands at fixed intervals. As\nsuch, the length of execution duration becomes a crucial parameter to the\nnavigation algorithm. In particular, if the duration is too short, then the\nnavigation policy would be executed at a high frequency, with increased\ntraining difficulty and high computational cost. Meanwhile, if the duration is\ntoo long, then the policy becomes unable to handle complex situations, like\nthose with crowded obstacles. It is thus tricky to find the \"sweet\" duration\nrange; some duration values may render a DRL model to fail to find a navigation\npath. In this paper, we propose to employ adaptive execution duration to\novercome this problem. Specifically, we formulate the navigation task as a\nSemi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) problem to handle adaptive execution\nduration. We also improve the distributed proximal policy optimization (DPPO)\nalgorithm and provide its theoretical guarantee for the specified SMDP problem.\nWe evaluate our approach both in the simulator and on an actual robot. The\nresults show that our approach outperforms the other DRL-based method (with\nfixed execution duration) by 10.3% in terms of the navigation success rate.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning and convolutional neural networks allow achieving impressive\nperformance in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic\nsegmentation (SS). However, recent studies have shown evident weaknesses of\nsuch models against adversarial perturbations. In a real-world scenario\ninstead, like autonomous driving, more attention should be devoted to\nreal-world adversarial examples (RWAEs), which are physical objects (e.g.,\nbillboards and printable patches) optimized to be adversarial to the entire\nperception pipeline. This paper presents an in-depth evaluation of the\nrobustness of popular SS models by testing the effects of both digital and\nreal-world adversarial patches. These patches are crafted with powerful attacks\nenriched with a novel loss function. Firstly, an investigation on the\nCityscapes dataset is conducted by extending the Expectation Over\nTransformation (EOT) paradigm to cope with SS. Then, a novel attack\noptimization, called scene-specific attack, is proposed. Such an attack\nleverages the CARLA driving simulator to improve the transferability of the\nproposed EOT-based attack to a real 3D environment. Finally, a printed physical\nbillboard containing an adversarial patch was tested in an outdoor driving\nscenario to assess the feasibility of the studied attacks in the real world.\nExhaustive experiments revealed that the proposed attack formulations\noutperform previous work to craft both digital and real-world adversarial\npatches for SS. At the same time, the experimental results showed how these\nattacks are notably less effective in the real world, hence questioning the\npractical relevance of adversarial attacks to SS models for autonomous/assisted\ndriving.",

    "abstract": "Robots in our daily surroundings are increasing day by day. Their usability\nand acceptability largely depend on their explicit and implicit interaction\ncapability with fellow human beings. As a result, social behavior is one of the\nmost sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no\nspecific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it\nlargely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we\ninvestigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of\npeople is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as\nhuman beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we\ndo position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group\nactivity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality,\nfirst, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine\na position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation\ncan be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very\ndiverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we\nprovide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and\ngroup detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications. We also\nput forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible\nconcerns and modules relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on\nmethods, camera views, datasets, detection capabilities and scale, evaluation\napproaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open challenges and\nlimitations in current literature along with possible future research\ndirections based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing\nmethods/techniques and their relative merits and demerits, applications, and\nprovide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous parking systems start with the detection of available parking\nslots. Parking slot detection performance has been dramatically improved by\ndeep learning techniques. Deep learning-based object detection methods can be\ncategorized into one-stage and two-stage approaches. Although it is well-known\nthat the two-stage approach outperforms the one-stage approach in general\nobject detection, they have performed similarly in parking slot detection so\nfar. We consider this is because the two-stage approach has not yet been\nadequately specialized for parking slot detection. Thus, this paper proposes a\nhighly specialized two-stage parking slot detector that uses region-specific\nmulti-scale feature extraction. In the first stage, the proposed method finds\nthe entrance of the parking slot as a region proposal by estimating its center,\nlength, and orientation. The second stage of this method designates specific\nregions that most contain the desired information and extracts features from\nthem. That is, features for the location and orientation are separately\nextracted from only the specific regions that most contain the locational and\norientational information. In addition, multi-resolution feature maps are\nutilized to increase both positioning and classification accuracies. A\nhigh-resolution feature map is used to extract detailed information (location\nand orientation), while another low-resolution feature map is used to extract\nsemantic information (type and occupancy). In experiments, the proposed method\nwas quantitatively evaluated with two large-scale public parking slot detection\ndatasets and outperformed previous methods, including both one-stage and\ntwo-stage approaches.",

    "title": "Nonlinear modal testing of damped structures: Velocity feedback vs.  phase resonance",
    "abstract": "In recent years, a new method for experimental nonlinear modal analysis has\nbeen developed, which is based on the extended periodic motion concept. The\nmethod is well suited to experimentally obtain amplitude-dependent modal\nproperties (modal frequency, damping ratio and deflection shape) for strongly\nnonlinear systems. To isolate a nonlinear mode, the negative viscous damping\nterm of the extended periodic motion concept is approximated by ensuring phase\nresonance between excitation and response. In this work, an alternative\napproach to isolate a nonlinear mode is developed and analyzed: velocity\nfeedback. The accuracy of the extracted modal properties and robustness of\nvelocity feedback is first assessed by means of simulated experiments. The two\napproaches phase resonance and velocity feedback are then compared in terms of\naccuracy and experimental implementation effort. To this end, both approaches\nare applied to an experimental specimen, which is a cantilevered beam\ninfluenced by a strong dry friction nonlinearity. In this work, the discussion\nis limited to single-point excitation. It is shown that a robust implementation\nof velocity feedback requires the measurement of several response signals,\ndistributed over the structure. An advantage of velocity feedback is that no\ncontroller is needed. The accuracy of the modal properties can, however, suffer\nfrom imperfections of the excitation mechanism such as a phase lag due to\nexciter-structure interactions or gyroscopic forces due to single-point\nexcitation.",

    "abstract": "Computer-generated holographic (CGH) displays show great potential and are\nemerging as the next-generation displays for augmented and virtual reality, and\nautomotive heads-up displays. One of the critical problems harming the wide\nadoption of such displays is the presence of speckle noise inherent to\nholography, that compromises its quality by introducing perceptible artifacts.\nAlthough speckle noise suppression has been an active research area, the\nprevious works have not considered the perceptual characteristics of the Human\nVisual System (HVS), which receives the final displayed imagery. However, it is\nwell studied that the sensitivity of the HVS is not uniform across the visual\nfield, which has led to gaze-contingent rendering schemes for maximizing the\nperceptual quality in various computer-generated imagery. Inspired by this, we\npresent the first method that reduces the \"perceived speckle noise\" by\nintegrating foveal and peripheral vision characteristics of the HVS, along with\nthe retinal point spread function, into the phase hologram computation.\nSpecifically, we introduce the anatomical and statistical retinal receptor\ndistribution into our computational hologram optimization, which places a\nhigher priority on reducing the perceived foveal speckle noise while being\nadaptable to any individual's optical aberration on the retina. Our method\ndemonstrates superior perceptual quality on our emulated holographic display.\nOur evaluations with objective measurements and subjective studies demonstrate\na significant reduction of the human perceived noise.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent recommendation and reminder systems are the need of the\nfast-pacing life. Current intelligent systems such as Siri, Google Assistant,\nMicrosoft Cortona, etc., have limited capability. For example, if you want to\nwake up at 6 am because you have an upcoming trip, you have to set the alarm\nmanually. Besides, these systems do not recommend or remind what else to carry,\nsuch as carrying an umbrella during a likely rain. The present work proposes a\nsystem that takes an email as input and returns a recommendation-cumreminder\nlist. As a first step, we parse the emails, recognize the entities using named\nentity recognition (NER). In the second step, information retrieval over the\nweb is done to identify nearby places, climatic conditions, etc. Imperative\nsentences from the reviews of all places are extracted and passed to the object\nextraction module. The main challenge lies in extracting the objects (items) of\ninterest from the review. To solve it, a modified Machine Reading\nComprehension-NER (MRC-NER) model is trained to tag objects of interest by\nformulating annotation rules as a query. The objects so found are recommended\nto the user one day in advance. The final reminder list of objects is pruned by\nour proposed model for tracking objects kept during the \"packing activity.\"\nEventually, when the user leaves for the event/trip, an alert is sent\ncontaining the reminding list items. Our approach achieves superior performance\ncompared to several baselines by as much as 30% on recall and 10% on precision.",

Therefore, detecting\nmultimodal hateful content has recently garnered much attention in academic and\nindustry research communities. This paper aims to contribute to this emerging\nresearch topic by proposing DisMultiHate, which is a novel framework that\nperformed the classification of multimodal hateful content. Specifically,\nDisMultiHate is designed to disentangle target entities in multimodal memes to\nimprove hateful content classification and explainability. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on two publicly available hateful and offensive memes datasets. Our\nexperiment results show that DisMultiHate is able to outperform\nstate-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal baselines in the hateful meme\nclassification task.

    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is a long-standing problem of recommender\nsystems. Many novel methods have been proposed, ranging from classical matrix\nfactorization to recent graph convolutional network-based approaches. After\nrecent fierce debates, researchers started to focus on linear graph\nconvolutional networks (GCNs) with a layer combination, which show\nstate-of-the-art accuracy in many datasets. In this work, we extend them based\non neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), because the linear GCN\nconcept can be interpreted as a differential equation, and present the method\nof Learnable-Time ODE-based Collaborative Filtering (LT-OCF). The main novelty\nin our method is that after redesigning linear GCNs on top of the NODE regime,\ni) we learn the optimal architecture rather than relying on manually designed\nones, ii) we learn smooth ODE solutions that are considered suitable for CF,\nand iii) we test with various ODE solvers that internally build a diverse set\nof neural network connections. We also present a novel training method\nspecialized to our method. In our experiments with three benchmark datasets,\nGowalla, Yelp2018, and Amazon-Book, our method consistently shows better\naccuracy than existing methods, e.g., a recall of 0.0411 by LightGCN vs. 0.0442\nby LT-OCF and an NDCG of 0.0315 by LightGCN vs. 0.0341 by LT-OCF in\nAmazon-Book. One more important discovery in our experiments that is worth\nmentioning is that our best accuracy was achieved by dense connections rather\nthan linear connections.",

One practical challenge for popularity prediction\ntakes roots in the different settings of popularity prediction tasks in\ndifferent situations, e.g., the varying lengths of the observation time window\nor prediction horizon. In other words, a good model for popularity prediction\nis desired to handle various tasks with different settings. However, the\nconventional paradigm for popularity prediction is training a separate\nprediction model for each prediction task, and thus the obtained model for one\ntask is difficult to be generalized to other tasks, causing a great waste of\ntraining time and computational resources. To solve this issue, in this paper,\nwe propose a novel pre-training framework for popularity prediction, aiming to\npre-train a general deep representation model by learning intrinsic knowledge\nabout popularity dynamics from the readily available diffusion cascades. We\ndesign a novel pretext task for pre-training, i.e., temporal context prediction\nfor two randomly sampled time slices of popularity dynamics, impelling the deep\nprediction model to effectively capture the characteristics of popularity\ndynamics.

However, most existing\nlearning-based approaches usually suffer from limited manually annotated\nmedical data, which poses a major practical problem for accurate and robust\nmedical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised\napproaches are usually not robust compared with the supervised counterparts,\nand also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic\ninformation, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we\npresent SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly\nadvances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe\nan unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and\npredicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive\nobjective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach\nworks surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully\nsupervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can\nbe viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust\nto representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation\nby distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular\ndatasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT\ndataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of\nlabeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of\n90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to\nprevious best results.

However, due to the limitations of data collection, including\ninfrastructure density, user privacy, and business security, such fine-grained\ndata is hard to collect and usually, only coarse-grained data is available.\nThus, obtaining fine-grained population distribution from coarse-grained\ndistribution becomes an important problem. To complete this task, existing\nmethods mainly rely on sufficient fine-grained ground truth for training, which\nis not often available. This limits the applications of these methods and\nbrings the necessity to transfer knowledge from data-sufficient cities to\ndata-scarce cities.\nIn knowledge transfer scenario, we employ single reference fine-grained\nground truth in the target city as the ground truth to inform the large-scale\nurban structure and support the knowledge transfer in the target city. By this\napproach, we transform the fine-grained population mapping problem into a\none-shot transfer learning problem for population mapping task.\nIn this paper, we propose a one-shot transfer learning framework, PSRNet, to\ntransfer spatial-temporal knowledge across cities in fine-grained population\nmapping task from the view of network structure, data, and optimization.\nExperiments on real-life datasets of 4 cities demonstrate that PSRNet has\nsignificant advantages over 8 baselines by reducing RMSE and MAE for more than\n25%.

    "abstract": "While there has been a number of studies on Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) for 2D\nimages, its application to 3D data is still recent and scarce, with just a few\nmethods limited to classification. We present the first generative approach for\nboth ZSL and Generalized ZSL (GZSL) on 3D data, that can handle both\nclassification and, for the first time, semantic segmentation. We show that it\nreaches or outperforms the state of the art on ModelNet40 classification for\nboth inductive ZSL and inductive GZSL. For semantic segmentation, we created\nthree benchmarks for evaluating this new ZSL task, using S3DIS, ScanNet and\nSemanticKITTI.

In such dynamic environments, the so-called data\nstreams, fairness-aware learning cannot be considered as a one-off requirement,\nbut rather it should comprise a continual requirement over the stream. Recent\nfairness-aware stream classifiers ignore the problem of class imbalance, which\nmanifests in many real-life applications, and mitigate discrimination mainly\nbecause they \"reject\" minority instances at large due to their inability to\neffectively learn all classes.\nIn this work, we propose \\ours, an online fairness-aware approach that\nmaintains a valid and fair classifier over the stream. \\ours~is an online\nboosting approach that changes the training distribution in an online fashion\nby monitoring stream's class imbalance and tweaks its decision boundary to\nmitigate discriminatory outcomes over the stream. Experiments on 8 real-world\nand 1 synthetic datasets from different domains with varying class imbalance\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art fairness-aware\nstream approaches with a range (relative) increase [11.2\\%-14.2\\%] in balanced\naccuracy, [22.6\\%-31.8\\%] in gmean, [42.5\\%-49.6\\%] in recall, [14.3\\%-25.7\\%]\nin kappa and [89.4\\%-96.6\\%] in statistical parity (fairness).",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, the advent of cybercrime has accelarated the research\non cybersecurity. However, the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls\nshort. One of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic evaluation\ndatasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare them.\nThis is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to\nclassify network connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can\nlearn from small sets of labeled data, (ii) that can make predictions on large\nsets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of only specially\nselected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of\ninterest. These approaches choose speci?fic unlabeled instances by a query\nfunction that are expected to improve overall classi?cation performance. The\nresulting query observations are labeled by a human expert and added to the\nlabeled set.\nIn this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine. Firstly, it\ndetermines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it\nis to enhance classi?cation. These properties are the uncertainty score and\nanomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine introduces dynamic updating. This allows the\nmodel to adjust the balance between querying uncertain, anomalous and randomly\nselected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query\nstrategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL\nmethods in cybersecurity that all have static, predetermined query functions.\nWe show that dynamic updating, and therefore Jasmine, is able to consistently\nobtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties, only\nanomalies or a ?fixed combination of the two.",

    "abstract": "Algorithmic decision support is rapidly becoming a staple of personalized\nmedicine, especially for high-stakes recommendations in which access to certain\ninformation can drastically alter the course of treatment, and thus, patient\noutcome; a prominent example is radiomics for cancer subtyping. Because in\nthese scenarios the stakes are high, it is desirable for decision systems to\nnot only provide recommendations but supply transparent reasoning in support\nthereof. For learning-based systems, this can be achieved through an\ninterpretable design of the inference pipeline. Herein we describe an automated\nyet interpretable system for uveal melanoma subtyping with digital cytology\nimages from fine needle aspiration biopsies. Our method embeds every\nautomatically segmented cell of a candidate cytology image as a point in a 2D\nmanifold defined by many representative slides, which enables reasoning about\nthe cell-level composition of the tissue sample, paving the way for\ninterpretable subtyping of the biopsy. Finally, a rule-based slide-level\nclassification algorithm is trained on the partitions of the circularly\ndistorted 2D manifold. This process results in a simple rule set that is\nevaluated automatically but highly transparent for human verification. On our\nin house cytology dataset of 88 uveal melanoma patients, the proposed method\nachieves an accuracy of 87.5% that compares favorably to all competing\napproaches, including deep \"black box\" models. The method comes with a user\ninterface to facilitate interaction with cell-level content, which may offer\nadditional insights for pathological assessment.",

    "abstract": "We introduce \\textbf{OP}tical \\textbf{AD}versarial attack (OPAD). OPAD is an\nadversarial attack in the physical space aiming to fool image classifiers\nwithout physically touching the objects (e.g., moving or painting the objects).\nThe principle of OPAD is to use structured illumination to alter the appearance\nof the target objects. The system consists of a low-cost projector, a camera,\nand a computer. The challenge of the problem is the non-linearity of the\nradiometric response of the projector and the spatially varying spectral\nresponse of the scene. Attacks generated in a conventional approach do not work\nin this setting unless they are calibrated to compensate for such a\nprojector-camera model. The proposed solution incorporates the projector-camera\nmodel into the adversarial attack optimization, where a new attack formulation\nis derived. Experimental results prove the validity of the solution. It is\ndemonstrated that OPAD can optically attack a real 3D object in the presence of\nbackground lighting for white-box, black-box, targeted, and untargeted attacks.\nTheoretical analysis is presented to quantify the fundamental performance limit\nof the system.",

The work\nreported in this paper builds on this project through the use of transfer\nlearning and data augmentation techniques to ameliorate classification\naccuracy. Starting with a convolutional neural network (CNN), a systematic\napproach is followed for selecting appropriate splitting ratios and for tuning\nmultiple training parameters including learning rate schedulers, layers\nfreezing, batch sizes and loss functions, in the context of the given scenario\nwhich requires classification of waste into different recycling types.

Subsequently, a range of\ndata augmentation techniques are then incorporated into this work including\nflipping, rotation, shearing, zooming, and brightness control. Results show\nthat these augmentation techniques further improve the test accuracy of the\nfinal model to 95.40%. Unlike other work reported in the field, this paper\nprovides full details regarding the training of the model.

In the existing\nliterature in neural ranking, two dense retrieval families have become\napparent: single representation, where entire passages are represented by a\nsingle embedding (usually BERT's [CLS] token, as exemplified by the recent ANCE\napproach), or multiple representations, where each token in a passage is\nrepresented by its own embedding (as exemplified by the recent ColBERT\napproach). These two families have not been directly compared. However, because\nof the likely importance of dense retrieval moving forward, a clear\nunderstanding of their advantages and disadvantages is paramount. To this end,\nthis paper contributes a direct study on their comparative effectiveness,\nnoting situations where each method under/over performs w.r.t. each other, and\nw.r.t. a BM25 baseline. We observe that, while ANCE is more efficient than\nColBERT in terms of response time and memory usage, multiple representations\nare statistically more effective than the single representations for MAP and\nMRR@10. We also show that multiple representations obtain better improvements\nthan single representations for queries that are the hardest for BM25, as well\nas for definitional queries, and those with complex information needs.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks on the graph structure. Although multiple\nworks have been proposed to improve their robustness against such structural\nadversarial attacks, the reasons for the success of the attacks remain unclear.\nIn this work, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that structural\nadversarial examples can be attributed to the non-robust aggregation scheme\n(i.e., the weighted mean) of GCNs. Specifically, our analysis takes advantage\nof the breakdown point which can quantitatively measure the robustness of\naggregation schemes. The key insight is that weighted mean, as the basic design\nof GCNs, has a low breakdown point and its output can be dramatically changed\nby injecting a single edge. We show that adopting the aggregation scheme with a\nhigh breakdown point (e.g., median or trimmed mean) could significantly enhance\nthe robustness of GCNs against structural attacks. Extensive experiments on\nfour real-world datasets demonstrate that such a simple but effective method\nachieves the best robustness performance compared to state-of-the-art models.",

However, it remains nontrivial to better\nadaptively balance effective multi-modal information in the feature fusion\nphase. In this letter, we propose a novel gated recoding network (GRNet) to\nevaluate the information validity of the two modes, and balance their\ninfluence. Our framework is divided into three phases: perception phase,\nrecoding mixing phase and feature integration phase. First, A perception\nencoder is adopted to extract multi-level single-modal features, which lays the\nfoundation for multi-modal semantic comparative analysis. Then, a\nmodal-adaptive gate unit (MGU) is proposed to suppress the invalid information\nand transfer the effective modal features to the recoding mixer and the hybrid\nbranch decoder. The recoding mixer is responsible for recoding and mixing the\nbalanced multi-modal information. Finally, the hybrid branch decoder completes\nthe multi-level feature integration under the guidance of an optional edge\nguidance stream (OEGS). Experiments and analysis on eight popular benchmarks\nverify that our framework performs favorably against 9 state-of-art methods.",

Moreover, Transformer-based architectures have proven to\nbeat state-of-the-art models in summarizing news data. In this paper, we\nutilize a Transformer-based Pointer Generator Network to generate abstract\nsummaries for meeting transcripts. This model uses 2 LSTMs as an encoder and a\ndecoder, a Pointer network which copies words from the inputted text, and a\nGenerator network to produce out-of-vocabulary words (hence making the summary\nabstractive). Moreover, a coverage mechanism is used to avoid repetition of\nwords in the generated summary. First, we show that training the model on a\nnews summary dataset and using zero-shot learning to test it on the meeting\ndataset proves to produce better results than training it on the AMI meeting\ndataset.

We show that our improved model is able to improve on previous\nmodels by at least 5 ROUGE-2 scores, which is a substantial improvement.

As these DNNs\nare expensive and because many applications can tolerate approximate answers,\nanalysts are interested in accelerating these queries via approximations.\nUnfortunately, standard approximate query processing techniques to accelerate\nsuch queries are not applicable because they assume the result of the\npredicates are available ahead of time. Furthermore, recent work using cheap\napproximations (i.e., proxies) do not support aggregation queries with\npredicates.\nTo accelerate aggregation queries with expensive predicates, we develop and\nanalyze a query processing algorithm that leverages proxies (ABae). ABae must\naccount for the key challenge that it may sample records that do not satisfy\nthe predicate. To address this challenge, we first use the proxy to group\nrecords into strata so that records satisfying the predicate are ideally\ngrouped into few strata. Given these strata, ABae uses pilot sampling and\nplugin estimates to sample according to the optimal allocation. We show that\nABae converges at an optimal rate in a novel analysis of stratified sampling\nwith draws that may not satisfy the predicate.

However, the existing QA\ndatasets contain rather few time-sensitive questions, hence not suitable for\ndiagnosing or benchmarking the model's temporal reasoning capability. In order\nto promote research in this direction, we propose to construct a time-sensitive\nQA dataset. The dataset is constructed by 1) mining time-evolving facts from\nWikiData and align them to their corresponding Wikipedia page, 2) employing\ncrowd workers to verify and calibrate these noisy facts, 3) generating\nquestion-answer pairs based on the annotated time-sensitive facts. Our dataset\nposes two novel challenges: 1) the model needs to understand both explicit and\nimplicit mention of time information in the long document, 2) the model needs\nto perform temporal reasoning like comparison, addition, subtraction. We\nevaluate different SoTA long-document QA systems like BigBird and FiD on our\ndataset.

    "abstract": "Cloud computing provides a powerful yet low-cost environment for distributed\ndeep learning workloads. However, training complex deep learning models often\nrequires accessing large amounts of data, which can easily exceed the capacity\nof local disks. Prior research often overlooks this training data problem by\nimplicitly assuming that data is available locally or via low latency\nnetwork-based data storage. Such implicit assumptions often do not hold in a\ncloud-based training environment, where deep learning practitioners create and\ntear down dedicated GPU clusters on demand, or do not have the luxury of local\nstorage, such as in serverless workloads. In this work, we investigate the\nperformance of distributed training that leverages training data residing\nentirely inside cloud storage buckets. These buckets promise low storage costs,\nbut come with inherent bandwidth limitations that make them seem unsuitable for\nan efficient training solution. To account for these bandwidth limitations, we\npropose the use of two classical techniques, namely caching and pre-fetching,\nto mitigate the training performance degradation. We implement a prototype,\nDELI, based on the popular deep learning framework PyTorch by building on its\ndata loading abstractions. We then evaluate the training performance of two\ndeep learning workloads using Google Cloud's NVIDIA K80 GPU servers and show\nthat we can reduce the time that the training loop is waiting for data by\n85.6%-93.5% compared to loading directly from a storage bucket - thus achieving\ncomparable performance to loading data directly from disk - while only storing\na fraction of the data locally at a time.

    "abstract": "Recent work building open-domain chatbots has demonstrated that increasing\nmodel size improves performance. On the other hand, latency and connectivity\nconsiderations dictate the move of digital assistants on the device. Giving a\ndigital assistant like Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant the ability to discuss\njust about anything leads to the need for reducing the chatbot model size such\nthat it fits on the user's device. We demonstrate that low parameter models can\nsimultaneously retain their general knowledge conversational abilities while\nimproving in a specific domain. Additionally, we propose a generic framework\nthat accounts for variety in question types, tracks reference throughout\nmulti-turn conversations, and removes inconsistent and potentially toxic\nresponses. Our framework seamlessly transitions between chatting and performing\ntransactional tasks, which will ultimately make interactions with digital\nassistants more human-like. We evaluate our framework on 1 internal and 4\npublic benchmark datasets using both automatic (Perplexity) and human (SSA -\nSensibleness and Specificity Average) evaluation metrics and establish\ncomparable performance while reducing model parameters by 90%.",

Under this setting, we reproduced a large\nnumber of previous augmentation methods and found that these methods bring\nmarginal gains at best and sometimes degrade the performance much. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation method FlipDA that jointly\nuses a generative model and a classifier to generate label-flipped data.\nCentral to the idea of FlipDA is the discovery that generating label-flipped\ndata is more crucial to the performance than generating label-preserved data.\nExperiments show that FlipDA achieves a good tradeoff between effectiveness and\nrobustness---it substantially improves many tasks while not negatively\naffecting the others.",

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation enables to alleviate the need for\nlarge-scale pixel-wise annotations. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL)\nwith a combination of image-to-image translation shows great effectiveness in\nadaptive segmentation. The most common practice is to perform SSL along with\nimage translation to well align a single domain (the source or target).\nHowever, in this single-domain paradigm, unavoidable visual inconsistency\nraised by image translation may affect subsequent learning. In this paper,\nbased on the observation that domain adaptation frameworks performed in the\nsource and target domain are almost complementary in terms of image translation\nand SSL, we propose a novel dual path learning (DPL) framework to alleviate\nvisual inconsistency. Concretely, DPL contains two complementary and\ninteractive single-domain adaptation pipelines aligned in source and target\ndomain respectively. The inference of DPL is extremely simple, only one\nsegmentation model in the target domain is employed. Novel technologies such as\ndual path image translation and dual path adaptive segmentation are proposed to\nmake two paths promote each other in an interactive manner. Experiments on\nGTA5$\\rightarrow$Cityscapes and SYNTHIA$\\rightarrow$Cityscapes scenarios\ndemonstrate the superiority of our DPL model over the state-of-the-art methods.\nThe code and models are available at: \\url{https://github.com/royee182/DPL}",

Numerical evaluation of the Karhunen-Lo\\`eve\nexpansion is performed once during precomputation and involves computing a\nnumerical eigendecomposition of an integral operator whose kernel is the\ncovariance function of the Gaussian process. The Karhunen-Lo\\`eve expansion is\nindependent of observed data and depends only on the covariance kernel and the\nsize of the interval on which the Gaussian process is defined. The scheme of\nthis paper does not require translation invariance of the covariance kernel. We\nalso introduce a class of fast algorithms for Bayesian fitting of\nhyperparameters, and demonstrate the performance of our algorithms with\nnumerical experiments in one and two dimensions.

    "abstract": "Mining dense subgraphs where vertices connect closely with each other is a\ncommon task when analyzing graphs. A very popular notion in subgraph analysis\nis core decomposition. Recently, Esfahani et al. presented a probabilistic core\ndecomposition algorithm based on graph peeling and Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\nthat is capable of handling very large graphs. Their proposed peeling algorithm\n(PA) starts from the lowest degree vertices and recursively deletes these\nvertices, assigning core numbers, and updating the degree of neighbour vertices\nuntil it reached the maximum core. However, in many applications, particularly\nin biology, more valuable information can be obtained from dense\nsub-communities and we are not interested in small cores where vertices do not\ninteract much with others. To make the previous PA focus more on dense\nsubgraphs, we propose a multi-stage graph peeling algorithm (M-PA) that has a\ntwo-stage data screening procedure added before the previous PA. After removing\nvertices from the graph based on the user-defined thresholds, we can reduce the\ngraph complexity largely and without affecting the vertices in subgraphs that\nwe are interested in. We show that M-PA is more efficient than the previous PA\nand with the properly set filtering threshold, can produce very similar if not\nidentical dense subgraphs to the previous PA (in terms of graph density and\nclustering coefficient).",

The conventional wisdom of estimating the impact\nof a feature in tree based models is to measure the \\textit{node-wise reduction\nof a loss function}, which (i) yields only global importance measures and (ii)\nis known to suffer from severe biases. Conditional feature contributions (CFCs)\nprovide \\textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following\nthe decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model\nto each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a\npotential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree.\nThe by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)\nvalues appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more\nexpensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations\ncomputed by both methods on a set of 164 publicly available classification\nproblems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current\nresearchers. For random forests, we find extremely high similarities and\ncorrelations of both local and global SHAP values and CFC scores, leading to\nvery similar rankings and interpretations.

Microbes have become novel targets for the development of\nantibacterial agents. Therefore, screening of microbe-drug associations can\nbenefit greatly drug research and development. With the increase of microbial\ngenomic and pharmacological datasets, we are greatly motivated to develop an\neffective computational method to identify new microbe-drug associations. In\nthis paper, we proposed a novel method, Graph2MDA, to predict microbe-drug\nassociations by using variational graph autoencoder (VGAE). We constructed\nmulti-modal attributed graphs based on multiple features of microbes and drugs,\nsuch as molecular structures, microbe genetic sequences, and function\nannotations. Taking as input the multi-modal attribute graphs, VGAE was trained\nto learn the informative and interpretable latent representations of each node\nand the whole graph, and then a deep neural network classifier was used to\npredict microbe-drug associations. The hyperparameter analysis and model\nablation studies showed the sensitivity and robustness of our model. We\nevaluated our method on three independent datasets and the experimental results\nshowed that our proposed method outperformed six existing state-of-the-art\nmethods. We also explored the meaningness of the learned latent representations\nof drugs and found that the drugs show obvious clustering patterns that are\nsignificantly consistent with drug ATC classification.
