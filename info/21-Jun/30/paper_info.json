    "abstract": "Advancing the state-of-the-art in large-scale biomedical semantic indexing\nand question answering is the main focus of the BioASQ challenge. BioASQ\norganizes respective tasks where different teams develop systems that are\nevaluated on the same benchmark datasets that represent the real information\nneeds of experts in the biomedical domain. This paper presents an overview of\nthe ninth edition of the BioASQ challenge in the context of the Conference and\nLabs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2021. In this year, a new question\nanswering task, named Synergy, is introduced to support researchers studying\nthe COVID-19 disease and measure the ability of the participating teams to\ndiscern information while the problem is still developing. In total, 42 teams\nwith more than 170 systems were registered to participate in the four tasks of\nthe challenge. The evaluation results, similarly to previous years, show a\nperformance gain against the baselines which indicates the continuous\nimprovement of the state-of-the-art in this field.",

    "abstract": "Trust is essential for sustaining cooperation among humans. The same\nprinciple applies during interaction with computers and robots: if we do not\ntrust them, we will not accept help from them. Extensive evidence has shown\nthat our trust in other agents depends on their performance. However, in\nuncertain environments, humans may not be able to estimate correctly other\nagents' performance, potentially leading to distrust or over-trust in peers and\nmachines. In the current study, we investigate whether humans' trust towards\npeers, computers and robots is biased by prior beliefs in uncertain interactive\nsettings. Participants made perceptual judgments and observed the simulated\nestimates of either a human participant, a computer or a social robot.\nParticipants could modify their judgments based on this feedback. Results show\nthat participants' belief about the nature of the interacting partner biased\ntheir compliance with the partners' judgments, although the partners' judgments\nwere identical. Surprisingly, the social robot was trusted more than the\ncomputer and the human partner. Trust in the alleged human partner was not\nfully predicted by its perceived performance, suggesting the emergence of\nnormative processes in peer interaction. Our findings offer novel insights in\nthe understanding of the mechanisms underlying trust towards peers and\nautonomous agents.",

    "title": "Striking the Right Balance: Recall Loss for Semantic Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Class imbalance is a fundamental problem in computer vision applications such\nas semantic segmentation. Specifically, uneven class distributions in a\ntraining dataset often result in unsatisfactory performance on\nunder-represented classes. Many works have proposed to weight the standard\ncross entropy loss function with pre-computed weights based on class\nstatistics, such as the number of samples and class margins. There are two\nmajor drawbacks to these methods: 1) constantly up-weighting minority classes\ncan introduce excessive false positives in semantic segmentation; 2) a minority\nclass is not necessarily a hard class. The consequence is low precision due to\nexcessive false positives. In this regard, we propose a hard-class mining loss\nby reshaping the vanilla cross entropy loss such that it weights the loss for\neach class dynamically based on instantaneous recall performance. We show that\nthe novel recall loss changes gradually between the standard cross entropy loss\nand the inverse frequency weighted loss. Recall loss also leads to improved\nmean accuracy while offering competitive mean Intersection over Union (IoU)\nperformance. On Synthia dataset, recall loss achieves 9% relative improvement\non mean accuracy with competitive mean IoU using DeepLab-ResNet18 compared to\nthe cross entropy loss.

    "abstract": "Edge intelligence, which is a new paradigm to accelerate artificial\nintelligence (AI) applications by leveraging computing resources on the network\nedge, can be used to improve intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However,\ndue to physical limitations and energy-supply constraints, the computing powers\nof edge equipment are usually limited. High altitude platform station (HAPS)\ncomputing can be considered as a promising extension of edge computing. HAPS is\ndeployed in the stratosphere to provide wide coverage and strong computational\ncapabilities. It is suitable to coordinate terrestrial resources and store the\nfundamental data associated with ITS-based applications. In this work, three\ncomputing layers,i.e., vehicles, terrestrial network edges, and HAPS, are\nintegrated to build a computation framework for ITS, where the HAPS data\nlibrary stores the fundamental data needed for the applications. In addition,\nthe caching technique is introduced for network edges to store some of the\nfundamental data from the HAPS so that large propagation delays can be reduced.\nWe aim to minimize the delay of the system by optimizing computation offloading\nand caching decisions as well as bandwidth and computing resource allocations.\nThe simulation results highlight the benefits of HAPS computing for mitigating\ndelays and the significance of caching at network edges.",

We\nconsider the problem of designing data structures that maintain the\nconnectivity structure of $\\mathcal{D}(S)$ while allowing the insertion and\ndeletion of sites. For unit disk graphs we describe a data structure that has\n$O(\\log^2n)$ amortized update time and $O((\\log n)/(\\log\\log n))$ amortized\nquery time.\nFor disk graphs where the ratio $\\Psi$ between the largest and smallest\nradius is bounded, we consider the decremental and the incremental case\nseparately, in addition to the fully dynamic case.

Significant progress has recently been made in developing\nneural scene representations and rendering techniques that synthesize\nphotorealistic images from arbitrary views.

Inspired by neural\nvariants of image-based rendering, we develop a new neural rendering approach\nwith the goal of quickly learning a high-quality representation which can also\nbe rendered in real-time. Our approach, MetaNLR++, accomplishes this by using a\nunique combination of a neural shape representation and 2D CNN-based image\nfeature extraction, aggregation, and re-projection. To push representation\nconvergence times down to minutes, we leverage meta learning to learn neural\nshape and image feature priors which accelerate training. The optimized shape\nand image features can then be extracted using traditional graphics techniques\nand rendered in real time. We show that MetaNLR++ achieves similar or better\nnovel view synthesis results in a fraction of the time that competing methods\nrequire.",

As more and more realistic PAs with novel types spring up, traditional\nFAS methods based on handcrafted features become unreliable due to their\nlimited representation capacity. With the emergence of large-scale academic\ndatasets in the recent decade, deep learning based FAS achieves remarkable\nperformance and dominates this area. However, existing reviews in this field\nmainly focus on the handcrafted features, which are outdated and uninspiring\nfor the progress of FAS community. In this paper, to stimulate future research,\nwe present the first comprehensive review of recent advances in deep learning\nbased FAS. It covers several novel and insightful components: 1) besides\nsupervision with binary label (e.g., '0' for bonafide vs. '1' for PAs), we also\ninvestigate recent methods with pixel-wise supervision (e.g., pseudo depth\nmap); 2) in addition to traditional intra-dataset evaluation, we collect and\nanalyze the latest methods specially designed for domain generalization and\nopen-set FAS; and 3) besides commercial RGB camera, we summarize the deep\nlearning applications under multi-modal (e.g., depth and infrared) or\nspecialized (e.g., light field and flash) sensors.

To the best of our\nknowledge, these are the first adversarially robust results for these problems\nyet require no new algorithmic implementations.

    "abstract": "Tool use requires reasoning about the fit between an object's affordances and\nthe demands of a task. Visual affordance learning can benefit from\ngoal-directed interaction experience, but current techniques rely on human\nlabels or expert demonstrations to generate this data. In this paper, we\ndescribe a method that grounds affordances in physical interactions instead,\nthus removing the need for human labels or expert policies. We use an efficient\nsampling-based method to generate successful trajectories that provide contact\ndata, which are then used to reveal affordance representations. Our framework,\nGIFT, operates in two phases: first, we discover visual affordances from\ngoal-directed interaction with a set of procedurally generated tools; second,\nwe train a model to predict new instances of the discovered affordances on\nnovel tools in a self-supervised fashion. In our experiments, we show that GIFT\ncan leverage a sparse keypoint representation to predict grasp and interaction\npoints to accommodate multiple tasks, such as hooking, reaching, and hammering.\nGIFT outperforms baselines on all tasks and matches a human oracle on two of\nthree tasks using novel tools.",

Despite their popularity, the\nliterature on two-stage recommenders is relatively scarce, and the algorithms\nare often treated as the sum of their parts. Such treatment presupposes that\nthe two-stage performance is explained by the behavior of individual components\nif they were deployed independently. This is not the case: using synthetic and\nreal-world data, we demonstrate that interactions between the ranker and the\nnominators substantially affect the overall performance. Motivated by these\nfindings, we derive a generalization lower bound which shows that careful\nchoice of each nominator's training set is sometimes the only difference\nbetween a poor and an optimal two-stage recommender. Since searching for a good\nchoice manually is difficult, we learn one instead.

It removes the need for a robot\nto access and process information from many separate maps when performing a\ncomplex task and benefits from the correlation between map layers, advancing\nthe way robots interact with their environments. To this end, we design a\nmulti-task deep neural network with attention mechanisms as our front-end to\nprovide multiple observations for multiple map layers simultaneously.

This paper considers and analyzes a fully discrete\nfinite element method for a class of nonlinear stochastic wave equations, where\nthe diffusion term is globally Lipschitz continuous while the drift term is\nonly assumed to satisfy weaker conditions as in [11]. The novelties of this\npaper are threefold. First, the error estimates cannot not be directly obtained\nif the numerical scheme in primal form is used. The numerical scheme in mixed\nform is introduced and several H\\\"{o}lder continuity results of the strong\nsolution are proved, which are used to establish the error estimates in both\n$L^2$ norm and energy norms. Second, two types of discretization of the\nnonlinear term are proposed to establish the $L^2$ stability and energy\nstability results of the discrete solutions. These two types of discretization\nand proper test functions are designed to overcome the challenges arising from\nthe stochastic scaling in time issues and the nonlinear interaction. These\nstability results play key roles in proving the probability of the set on which\nthe error estimates hold approaches one. Third, higher order moment stability\nresults of the discrete solutions are proved based on an energy argument and\nthe underlying energy decaying property of the method. Numerical experiments\nare also presented to show the stability results of the discrete solutions and\nthe convergence rates in various norms.",

Nevertheless, many aspects of optimization and\ngeneralization and in particular the critical role of small random\ninitialization are not fully understood. In this paper, we take a step towards\ndemystifying this role by proving that small random initialization followed by\na few iterations of gradient descent behaves akin to popular spectral methods.\nWe also show that this implicit spectral bias from small random initialization,\nwhich is provably more prominent for overparameterized models, also puts the\ngradient descent iterations on a particular trajectory towards solutions that\nare not only globally optimal but also generalize well. Concretely, we focus on\nthe problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few measurements via a\nnatural nonconvex formulation. In this setting, we show that the trajectory of\nthe gradient descent iterations from small random initialization can be\napproximately decomposed into three phases: (I) a spectral or alignment phase\nwhere we show that that the iterates have an implicit spectral bias akin to\nspectral initialization allowing us to show that at the end of this phase the\ncolumn space of the iterates and the underlying low-rank matrix are\nsufficiently aligned, (II) a saddle avoidance/refinement phase where we show\nthat the trajectory of the gradient iterates moves away from certain degenerate\nsaddle points, and (III) a local refinement phase where we show that after\navoiding the saddles the iterates converge quickly to the underlying low-rank\nmatrix.

    "abstract": "This paper studies construction of above-ground biomass (AGB) prediction maps\nfrom synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity images. The purpose is to improve\ntraditional regression models based on SAR intensity, trained with a limited\namount of AGB in situ measurements. Although it is costly to collect, data from\nairborne laser scanning (ALS) sensors are highly correlated with AGB.\nTherefore, we propose using AGB predictions based on ALS data as surrogate\nresponse variables for SAR data in a sequential modelling fashion. This\nincreases the amount of training data dramatically. To model the regression\nfunction between SAR intensity and ALS-predicted AGB we propose to utilise a\nconditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), i.e. the Pix2Pix\nconvolutional neural network. This enables the recreation of existing ALS-based\nAGB prediction maps. The generated synthesised ALS-based AGB predictions are\nevaluated qualitatively and quantitatively against ALS-based AGB predictions\nretrieved from a traditional non-sequential regression model trained in the\nsame area. Results show that the proposed architecture manages to capture\ncharacteristics of the actual data. This suggests that the use of ALS-guided\ngenerative models is a promising avenue for AGB prediction from SAR intensity.\nFurther research on this area has the potential of providing both large-scale\nand low-cost predictions of AGB.",

Nevertheless, deploying such AI models across commodity\ndevices faces significant challenges: large computational cost, multiple\nperformance objectives, hardware heterogeneity and a common need for high\naccuracy, together pose critical problems to the deployment of DNNs across the\nvarious embedded and mobile devices in the wild. As such, we have yet to\nwitness the mainstream usage of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms\nacross consumer devices.

Then, we\npresent diverse methods for achieving real-time performance following a\ncross-stack approach. These span model-, system- and hardware-level techniques,\nand their combination. Our findings provide illustrative examples of AI systems\nthat do not overburden mobile hardware, while also indicating how they can\nimprove inference accuracy. Moreover, we showcase how custom ASIC- and\nFPGA-based accelerators can be an enabling factor for next-generation AI\napplications, such as multi-DNN systems.

Under-canopy agricultural\nnavigation has been a challenging problem because GNSS and other positioning\nsensors are prone to significant errors due to attentuation and multi-path\ncaused by crop leaves and stems. Reactive navigation by detecting crop rows\nusing LiDAR measurements is a better alternative to GPS but suffers from\nchallenges due to occlusion from leaves under the canopy.

Our system is validated extensively in real-world field\nenvironments over a distance of 50.88~km on multiple robots in different field\nconditions across different locations. We report state-of-the-art distance\nbetween intervention results, showing that our system is able to safely\nnavigate without interventions for 386.9~m on average in fields without\nsignificant gaps in the crop rows, 56.1~m in production fields and 47.5~m in\nfields with gaps (space of 1~m without plants in both sides of the row).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present Approximation Schemes for Capacitated Vehicle\nRouting Problem (CVRP) on several classes of graphs. In CVRP, introduced by\nDantzig and Ramser (1959), we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with metric edges\ncosts, a depot $r\\in V$, and a vehicle of bounded capacity $Q$. The goal is to\nfind minimum cost collection of tours for the vehicle that returns to the\ndepot, each visiting at most $Q$ nodes, such that they cover all the nodes.\nThis generalizes classic TSP and has been studied extensively. In the more\ngeneral setting, each node $v$ has a demand $d_v$ and the total demand of each\ntour must be no more than $Q$. Either the demand of each node must be served by\none tour (unsplittable) or can be served by multiple tour (splittable). The\nbest known approximation algorithm for general graphs has ratio\n$\\alpha+2(1-\\epsilon)$ (for the unsplittable) and $\\alpha+1-\\epsilon$ (for the\nsplittable) for some fixed $\\epsilon>\\frac{1}{3000}$, where $\\alpha$ is the\nbest approximation for TSP. Even for the case of trees, the best approximation\nratio is $4/3$ by Becker (2018) and it has been an open question if there is an\napproximation scheme for this simple class of graphs. Das and Mathieu (2015)\npresented an approximation scheme with time $n^{\\log^{O(1/\\epsilon)}n}$ for\nEuclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. No other approximation scheme is known for any\nother class of metrics (without further restrictions on $Q$). In this paper, we\nmake significant progress on this classic problem by presenting\nQuasi-Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (QPTAS) for graphs of bounded\ntreewidth, graphs of bounded highway dimensions, and graphs of bounded doubling\ndimensions. For comparison, our result implies an approximation scheme for\nEuclidean plane with run time $n^{O(\\log^{10}n/\\epsilon^{9})}$.",

    "abstract": "The rapid rise of accessibility of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones pose a\nthreat to general security and confidentiality. Most of the commercially\navailable or custom-built drones are multi-rotors and are comprised of multiple\npropellers. Since these propellers rotate at a high-speed, they are generally\nthe fastest moving parts of an image and cannot be directly \"seen\" by a\nclassical camera without severe motion blur. We utilize a class of sensors that\nare particularly suitable for such scenarios called event cameras, which have a\nhigh temporal resolution, low-latency, and high dynamic range.\nIn this paper, we model the geometry of a propeller and use it to generate\nsimulated events which are used to train a deep neural network called EVPropNet\nto detect propellers from the data of an event camera. EVPropNet directly\ntransfers to the real world without any fine-tuning or retraining. We present\ntwo applications of our network: (a) tracking and following an unmarked drone\nand (b) landing on a near-hover drone. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate\nthe proposed approach in many real-world experiments with different propeller\nshapes and sizes. Our network can detect propellers at a rate of 85.1% even\nwhen 60% of the propeller is occluded and can run at upto 35Hz on a 2W power\nbudget. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based solution for\ndetecting propellers (to detect drones). Finally, our applications also show an\nimpressive success rate of 92% and 90% for the tracking and landing tasks\nrespectively.",

Previous methods focus on learning\ndomain-invariant features to decrease the discrepancy between the feature\ndistributions as well as minimizing the source error and have made remarkable\nprogress.

It shows that besides a\nsmall source error, both the discrepancy between the feature distributions and\nthe discrepancy between the labeling functions should be small across domains.\nThe discrepancy between the labeling functions is essentially the cross-domain\nerrors which are ignored by existing methods.

In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of face recognition models\nusing adversarial patches based on transferability, where the attacker has\nlimited accessibility to the target models. First, we extend the existing\ntransfer-based attack techniques to generate transferable adversarial patches.\nHowever, we observe that the transferability is sensitive to initialization and\ndegrades when the perturbation magnitude is large, indicating the overfitting\nto the substitute models. Second, we propose to regularize the adversarial\npatches on the low dimensional data manifold. The manifold is represented by\ngenerative models pre-trained on legitimate human face images. Using face-like\nfeatures as adversarial perturbations through optimization on the manifold, we\nshow that the gaps between the responses of substitute models and the target\nmodels dramatically decrease, exhibiting a better transferability.

Numerous methods\nhave been proposed to tackle this problem, with most focusing on utilizing the\npredictions of unlabeled instances consistency alone to regularize networks.\nHowever, treating labeled and unlabeled data separately often leads to the\ndiscarding of mass prior knowledge learned from the labeled examples, and\nfailure to mine the feature interaction between the labeled and unlabeled image\npairs. In this paper, we propose a novel method for semi-supervised semantic\nsegmentation named GuidedMix-Net, by leveraging labeled information to guide\nthe learning of unlabeled instances. Specifically, we first introduce a feature\nalignment objective between labeled and unlabeled data to capture potentially\nsimilar image pairs and then generate mixed inputs from them. The proposed\nmutual information transfer (MITrans), based on the cluster assumption, is\nshown to be a powerful knowledge module for further progressive refining\nfeatures of unlabeled data in the mixed data space. To take advantage of the\nlabeled examples and guide unlabeled data learning, we further propose a mask\ngeneration module to generate high-quality pseudo masks for the unlabeled data.\nAlong with supervised learning for labeled data, the prediction of unlabeled\ndata is jointly learned with the generated pseudo masks from the mixed data.\nExtensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context and Cityscapes\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our GuidedMix-Net, which achieves competitive\nsegmentation accuracy and significantly improves the mIoU by +7$\\%$ compared to\nprevious state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Decomposable tasks are complex and comprise of a hierarchy of sub-tasks.\nSpoken intent prediction, for example, combines automatic speech recognition\nand natural language understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, typically\nhold out examples for only the surface-level sub-task. As a result, models with\nsimilar performance on these benchmarks may have unobserved performance\ndifferences on the other sub-tasks. To allow insightful comparisons between\ncompetitive end-to-end architectures, we propose a framework to construct\nrobust test sets using coordinate ascent over sub-task specific utility\nfunctions. Given a dataset for a decomposable task, our method optimally\ncreates a test set for each sub-task to individually assess sub-components of\nthe end-to-end model. Using spoken language understanding as a case study, we\ngenerate new splits for the Fluent Speech Commands and Snips SmartLights\ndatasets. Each split has two test sets: one with held-out utterances assessing\nnatural language understanding abilities, and one with held-out speakers to\ntest speech processing skills. Our splits identify performance gaps up to 10%\nbetween end-to-end systems that were within 1% of each other on the original\ntest sets. These performance gaps allow more realistic and actionable\ncomparisons between different architectures, driving future model development.\nWe release our splits and tools for the community.",

    "abstract": "Attention Mechanism is a widely used method for improving the performance of\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) on computer vision tasks. Despite its\npervasiveness, we have a poor understanding of what its effectiveness stems\nfrom. It is popularly believed that its effectiveness stems from the visual\nattention explanation, advocating focusing on the important part of input data\nrather than ingesting the entire input. In this paper, we find that there is\nonly a weak consistency between the attention weights of features and their\nimportance. Instead, we verify the crucial role of feature map multiplication\nin attention mechanism and uncover a fundamental impact of feature map\nmultiplication on the learned landscapes of CNNs: with the high order\nnon-linearity brought by the feature map multiplication, it played a\nregularization role on CNNs, which made them learn smoother and more stable\nlandscapes near real samples compared to vanilla CNNs. This smoothness and\nstability induce a more predictive and stable behavior in-between real samples,\nand make CNNs generate better. Moreover, motivated by the proposed\neffectiveness of feature map multiplication, we design feature map\nmultiplication network (FMMNet) by simply replacing the feature map addition in\nResNet with feature map multiplication. FMMNet outperforms ResNet on various\ndatasets, and this indicates that feature map multiplication plays a vital role\nin improving the performance even without finely designed attention mechanism\nin existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Neural text generation models are typically trained by maximizing\nlog-likelihood with the sequence cross entropy loss, which encourages an exact\ntoken-by-token match between a target sequence with a generated sequence. Such\ntraining objective is sub-optimal when the target sequence not perfect, e.g.,\nwhen the target sequence is corrupted with noises, or when only weak sequence\nsupervision is available. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nEdit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL), which computes the matching loss of a\ntarget n-gram with all n-grams in the generated sequence. EISL draws\ninspirations from convolutional networks (ConvNets) which are shift-invariant\nto images, hence is robust to the shift of n-grams to tolerate edits in the\ntarget sequences. Moreover, the computation of EISL is essentially a\nconvolution operation with target n-grams as kernels, which is easy to\nimplement with existing libraries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EISL, we\nconduct experiments on three tasks: machine translation with noisy target\nsequences, unsupervised text style transfer, and non-autoregressive machine\ntranslation. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms\ncross entropy loss on these three tasks.",

This improves\nmemorization of seen facts from the training time period, as well as\ncalibration on predictions about unseen facts from future time periods. We also\nshow that models trained with temporal context can be efficiently ``refreshed''\nas new data arrives, without the need for retraining from scratch.",

The low efficiency in model training and\ninference has increased the validation costs of model architectures in\nlarge-scale datasets. To address the above issue, recent advanced separable\nconvolutional layers are embedded into an early fused Multiple Input Branches\n(MIB) network, constructing an efficient Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)\nbaseline for skeleton-based action recognition.

On two\nlarge-scale datasets, i.e., NTU RGB+D 60 and 120, the proposed EfficientGCN-B4\nbaseline outperforms other SOTA methods, e.g., achieving 91.7% accuracy on the\ncross-subject benchmark of NTU 60 dataset, while being 3.15x smaller and 3.21x\nfaster than MS-G3D, which is one of the best SOTA methods.

Since several given topics\nonly provide limited source information, utilizing various topic-related\nknowledge is essential for improving essay generation performance.

This paper aims to improve essay generation by extracting\ninformation from both internal and external knowledge. Thus, a topic-to-essay\ngeneration model with comprehensive knowledge enhancement, named TEGKE, is\nproposed. For internal knowledge enhancement, both topics and related essays\nare fed to a teacher network as source information. Then, informative features\nwould be obtained from the teacher network and transferred to a student network\nwhich only takes topics as input but provides comparable information compared\nwith the teacher network. For external knowledge enhancement, a topic knowledge\ngraph encoder is proposed. Unlike the previous works only using the nearest\nneighbors of topics in the commonsense base, our topic knowledge graph encoder\ncould exploit more structural and semantic information of the commonsense\nknowledge graph to facilitate essay generation. Moreover, the adversarial\ntraining based on the Wasserstein distance is proposed to improve generation\nquality.

These\ndiffer by various factors, such as structural differences, input types, user\nassistance, etc. Most of them, base the architectural structure on\nconvolutional layers with no emphasis on layers specialised in object features\nextraction. We introduce a novel downsampling upsampling architecture named\nTUCaN (Tiny UCapsNet) that exploits the collaboration of convolutional layers\nand capsule layers to obtain a neat colourisation of entities present in every\nsingle image.

To\ntrain the network, in contrast with the standard end to end learning method, we\npropose the progressive learning scheme to extract the context of objects by\nonly manipulating the learning process without changing the model. In this\nscheme, the upsampling starts from the reconstruction of low resolution images\nand progressively grows to high resolution images throughout the training\nphase. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our approach\nwith ImageNet10k dataset outperforms existing methods on standard quality\nmetrics and achieves state of the art performances on image colourisation.

To bring about such ambition, a suite of collaborative sensing\nmodalities is required in order to sustain performance irrespective of\nchallenging dynamic conditions. Of the many modalities on offer, inertial\ntracking plays a key role under momentary unfavourable operational conditions\nowing to its independence of the surrounding environment. However, inertial\ntracking has traditionally (i) suffered from excessive error growth and (ii)\nrequired extensive and cumbersome tuning. Both of these issues have limited the\nappeal and utility of inertial tracking. In this paper, we present DIT: a novel\nDeep learning Inertial Tracking system that overcomes prior limitations;\nnamely, by (i) significantly reducing tracking drift and (ii) seamlessly\nconstructing robust and generalisable learned models. DIT describes two core\ncontributions: (i) DIT employs a robotic platform augmented with a mechanical\nslider subsystem that automatically samples inertial signal variabilities\narising from different sensor mounting geometries. We use the platform to\ncurate in-house a 7.2 million sample dataset covering an aggregate distance of\n21 kilometres split into 11 indexed sensor mounting geometries. (ii) DIT uses\ndeep learning, optimal transport, and domain adaptation (DA) to create a model\nwhich is robust to variabilities in sensor mounting geometry. The overall\nsystem synthesises high-performance and generalisable inertial navigation\nmodels in an end-to-end, robotic-learning fashion.

This paper presents a novel\napproach for analyzing failure data from cloud systems, in order to relieve\nhuman analysts from manually fine-tuning the data for feature engineering. The\napproach leverages Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), a family of unsupervised\nclustering algorithms based on deep learning, which uses an autoencoder to\noptimize data dimensionality and inter-cluster variance. We applied the\napproach in the context of the OpenStack cloud computing platform, both on the\nraw failure data and in combination with an anomaly detection pre-processing\nalgorithm. The results show that the performance of the proposed approach, in\nterms of purity of clusters, is comparable to, or in some cases even better\nthan manually fine-tuned clustering, thus avoiding the need for deep domain\nknowledge and reducing the effort to perform the analysis. In all cases, the\nproposed approach provides better performance than unsupervised clustering when\nno feature engineering is applied to the data.

    "abstract": "In many classification problems, collecting massive clean-annotated data is\nnot easy, and thus a lot of researches have been done to handle data with noisy\nlabels. Most recent state-of-art solutions for noisy label problems are built\non the small-loss strategy which exploits the memorization effect. While it is\na powerful tool, the memorization effect has several drawbacks. The\nperformances are sensitive to the choice of a training epoch required for\nutilizing the memorization effect. In addition, when the labels are heavily\ncontaminated or imbalanced, the memorization effect may not occur in which case\nthe methods based on the small-loss strategy fail to identify clean labeled\ndata. We introduce a new method called INN(Integration with the Nearest\nNeighborhoods) to refine clean labeled data from training data with noisy\nlabels. The proposed method is based on a new discovery that a prediction\npattern at neighbor regions of clean labeled data is consistently different\nfrom that of noisy labeled data regardless of training epochs. The INN method\nrequires more computation but is much stable and powerful than the small-loss\nstrategy. By carrying out various experiments, we demonstrate that the INN\nmethod resolves the shortcomings in the memorization effect successfully and\nthus is helpful to construct more accurate deep prediction models with training\ndata with noisy labels.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining the stability of the modern power grid is becoming increasingly\ndifficult due to fluctuating power consumption, unstable power supply coming\nfrom renewable energies, and unpredictable accidents such as man-made and\nnatural disasters. As the operation on the power grid must consider its impact\non future stability, reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed to provide\nsequential decision-making in power grid management. However, existing methods\nhave not considered the environmental constraints. As a result, the learned\npolicy has risk of selecting actions that violate the constraints in\nemergencies, which will escalate the issue of overloaded power lines and lead\nto large-scale blackouts. In this work, we propose a novel method for this\nproblem, which builds on top of the search-based planning algorithm. At the\nplanning stage, the search space is limited to the action set produced by the\npolicy. The selected action strictly follows the constraints by testing its\noutcome with the simulation function provided by the system. At the learning\nstage, to address the problem that gradients cannot be propagated to the\npolicy, we introduce Evolutionary Strategies (ES) with black-box policy\noptimization to improve the policy directly, maximizing the returns of the long\nrun.

    "abstract": "Deep learning based image recognition systems have been widely deployed on\nmobile devices in today's world. In recent studies, however, deep learning\nmodels are shown vulnerable to adversarial examples. One variant of adversarial\nexamples, called adversarial patch, draws researchers' attention due to its\nstrong attack abilities. Though adversarial patches achieve high attack success\nrates, they are easily being detected because of the visual inconsistency\nbetween the patches and the original images. Besides, it usually requires a\nlarge amount of data for adversarial patch generation in the literature, which\nis computationally expensive and time-consuming. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose an approach to generate inconspicuous adversarial patches with one\nsingle image. In our approach, we first decide the patch locations basing on\nthe perceptual sensitivity of victim models, then produce adversarial patches\nin a coarse-to-fine way by utilizing multiple-scale generators and\ndiscriminators. The patches are encouraged to be consistent with the background\nimages with adversarial training while preserving strong attack abilities. Our\napproach shows the strong attack abilities in white-box settings and the\nexcellent transferability in black-box settings through extensive experiments\non various models with different architectures and training methods. Compared\nto other adversarial patches, our adversarial patches hold the most negligible\nrisks to be detected and can evade human observations, which is supported by\nthe illustrations of saliency maps and results of user evaluations. Lastly, we\nshow that our adversarial patches can be applied in the physical world.",

    "abstract": "Domain generalization in person re-identification is a highly important\nmeaningful and practical task in which a model trained with data from several\nsource domains is expected to generalize well to unseen target domains. Domain\nadversarial learning is a promising domain generalization method that aims to\nremove domain information in the latent representation through adversarial\ntraining. However, in person re-identification, the domain and class are\ncorrelated, and we theoretically show that domain adversarial learning will\nlose certain information about class due to this domain-class correlation.\nInspired by casual inference, we propose to perform interventions to the domain\nfactor $d$, aiming to decompose the domain-class correlation. To achieve this\ngoal, we proposed estimating the resulting representation $z^{*}$ caused by the\nintervention through first- and second-order statistical characteristic\nmatching. Specifically, we build a memory bank to restore the statistical\ncharacteristics of each domain. Then, we use the newly generated samples\n$\\{z^{*},y,d^{*}\\}$ to compute the loss function. These samples are\ndomain-class correlation decomposed; thus, we can learn a domain-invariant\nrepresentation that can capture more class-related features. Extensive\nexperiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the\nlarge-scale domain generalization Re-ID benchmark.",

    "abstract": "The evaluation of neural machine translation systems is usually built upon\ngenerated translation of a certain decoding method (e.g., beam search) with\nevaluation metrics over the generated translation (e.g., BLEU). However, this\nevaluation framework suffers from high search errors brought by heuristic\nsearch algorithms and is limited by its nature of evaluation over one best\ncandidate. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation protocol, which not\nonly avoids the effect of search errors but provides a system-level evaluation\nin the perspective of model ranking. In particular, our method is based on our\nnewly proposed exact top-$k$ decoding instead of beam search. Our approach\nevaluates model errors by the distance between the candidate spaces scored by\nthe references and the model respectively. Extensive experiments on WMT'14\nEnglish-German demonstrate that bad ranking ability is connected to the\nwell-known beam search curse, and state-of-the-art Transformer models are\nfacing serious ranking errors. By evaluating various model architectures and\ntechniques, we provide several interesting findings.

Secondly, the process of system\nmodeling, error-system derivation, linearization and control has the manifold\nconstraints completely decoupled from the system descriptions, enabling the\ndevelopment of a symbolic MPC framework that naturally encapsulates the\nmanifold constraints. In this framework, users need only to supply\nsystem-specific descriptions without dealing with the manifold constraints. We\nimplement this framework and test it on a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV) operating on $SO(3) \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$ and an unmanned ground vehicle\n(UGV) moving on a curved surface. Real-world experiments show that the proposed\nframework and implementation achieve high tracking performance and\ncomputational efficiency even in highly aggressive aerobatic quadrotor\nmaneuvers.",

Deep\ngenerative models have also made significant advances through better modelling\nof the local correlations in the graph topology, which have been very useful\nfor predicting unobserved graph components, such as the existence of a link or\nthe class of a node, from nearby observed graph components. A complete\nscientific understanding of graph data should address both global and local\nstructure. In this paper, we propose a joint model for both as complementary\nobjectives in a graph VAE framework. Global structure is captured by\nincorporating graph kernels in a probabilistic model whose loss function is\nclosely related to the maximum mean discrepancy(MMD) between the global\nstructures of the reconstructed and the input graphs. The ELBO objective\nderived from the model regularizes a standard local link reconstruction term\nwith an MMD term.

As the view of cognitive neuroscience, visual depth perception\nmethods are divided into three categories, namely binocular, active, and\npictorial. The first two categories have been studied for decades in detail.\nHowever, research for the exploration of the third category is still in its\ninfancy and has got momentum by the advent of deep learning methods in recent\nyears. In cognitive neuroscience, it is known that pictorial depth perception\nmechanisms are dependent on the perception of seen objects. Inspired by this\nfact, in this thesis, we investigated the relation of perception of objects and\ndepth estimation convolutional neural networks. For this purpose, we developed\nnew network structures based on a simple depth estimation network that only\nused a single image at its input. Our proposed structures use both an image and\na semantic label of the image as their input. We used semantic labels as the\noutput of object perception. The obtained results of performance comparison\nbetween the developed network and original network showed that our novel\nstructures can improve the performance of depth estimation by 52\\% of relative\nerror of distance in the examined cases. Most of the experimental studies were\ncarried out on synthetic datasets that were generated by game engines to\nisolate the performance comparison from the effect of inaccurate depth and\nsemantic labels of non-synthetic datasets. It is shown that particular\nsynthetic datasets may be used for training of depth networks in cases that an\nappropriate dataset is not available. Furthermore, we showed that in these\ncases, usage of semantic labels improves the robustness of the network against\ndomain shift from synthetic training data to non-synthetic test data.",

Skeletal and Musculoskeletal human models were\nconsidered for motions in the sagittal plane, and results from both were\ncompared exhaustively. While skeletal models are driven with motor actuation,\nmusculoskeletal models perform through muscle-tendon actuation. Model-free\nreinforcement learning algorithms were used to optimize inverse dynamics\ncontrol actions to satisfy the objective of imitating a reference motion along\nwith secondary objectives of minimizing effort in terms of power spent by\nmotors and metabolic energy consumed by the muscles. On the one hand, the\ncontrol actions for the motor actuated model is the target joint angles\nconverted into joint torques through a Proportional-Differential controller.\nWhile on the other hand, the control actions for the muscle-tendon actuated\nmodel is the muscle excitations converted implicitly to muscle activations and\nthen to muscle forces which apply moments on joints. Muscle-tendon actuated\nmodels were found to have superiority over motor actuation as they are\ninherently smooth due to muscle activation dynamics and don't need any external\nregularizers. Finally, a strategy that was used to obtain an optimal\nconfiguration of the significant decision variables in the framework was\ndiscussed. All the results and analysis are presented in an illustrative,\nqualitative, and quantitative manner. Supporting video links are provided in\nthe Appendix.",

    "abstract": "3D LiDAR (light detection and ranging) based semantic segmentation is\nimportant in scene understanding for many applications, such as auto-driving\nand robotics. For example, for autonomous cars equipped with RGB cameras and\nLiDAR, it is crucial to fuse complementary information from different sensors\nfor robust and accurate segmentation. Existing fusion-based methods, however,\nmay not achieve promising performance due to the vast difference between two\nmodalities. In this work, we investigate a collaborative fusion scheme called\nperception-aware multi-sensor fusion (PMF) to exploit perceptual information\nfrom two modalities, namely, appearance information from RGB images and\nspatio-depth information from point clouds. To this end, we first project point\nclouds to the camera coordinates to provide spatio-depth information for RGB\nimages. Then, we propose a two-stream network to extract features from the two\nmodalities, separately, and fuse the features by effective residual-based\nfusion modules. Moreover, we propose additional perception-aware losses to\nmeasure the great perceptual difference between the two modalities. Extensive\nexperiments on two benchmark data sets show the superiority of our method. For\nexample, on nuScenes, our PMF outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.8%\nin mIoU.",

    "abstract": "Omnidirectional lighting provides the foundation for achieving\nspatially-variant photorealistic 3D rendering, a desirable property for mobile\naugmented reality applications. However, in practice, estimating\nomnidirectional lighting can be challenging due to limitations such as partial\npanoramas of the rendering positions, and the inherent environment lighting and\nmobile user dynamics. A new opportunity arises recently with the advancements\nin mobile 3D vision, including built-in high-accuracy depth sensors and deep\nlearning-powered algorithms, which provide the means to better sense and\nunderstand the physical surroundings. Centering the key idea of 3D vision, in\nthis work, we design an edge-assisted framework called Xihe to provide mobile\nAR applications the ability to obtain accurate omnidirectional lighting\nestimation in real time. Specifically, we develop a novel sampling technique\nthat efficiently compresses the raw point cloud input generated at the mobile\ndevice. This technique is derived based on our empirical analysis of a recent\n3D indoor dataset and plays a key role in our 3D vision-based lighting\nestimator pipeline design. To achieve the real-time goal, we develop a tailored\nGPU pipeline for on-device point cloud processing and use an encoding technique\nthat reduces network transmitted bytes. Finally, we present an adaptive\ntriggering strategy that allows Xihe to skip unnecessary lighting estimations\nand a practical way to provide temporal coherent rendering integration with the\nmobile AR ecosystem. We evaluate both the lighting estimation accuracy and time\nof Xihe using a reference mobile application developed with Xihe's APIs. Our\nresults show that Xihe takes as fast as 20.67ms per lighting estimation and\nachieves 9.4% better estimation accuracy than a state-of-the-art neural\nnetwork.",

Administrators at the state and local level are faced with the\nexceedingly difficult task of ensuring that each of their jurisdictions is\nproperly managed, while also monitoring for improper modifications to the\ndatabase. Monitoring changes to Voter Registration Files (VRFs) is crucial,\ngiven that a malicious actor wishing to disrupt the democratic process in the\nUS would be well-advised to manipulate the contents of these files in order to\nachieve their goals. In 2020, we saw election officials perform admirably when\nfaced with administering one of the most contentious elections in US history,\nbut much work remains to secure and monitor the election systems Americans rely\non. Using data created by comparing snapshots taken of VRFs over time, we\npresent a set of methods that make use of machine learning to ease the burden\non analysts and administrators in protecting voter rolls. We first evaluate the\neffectiveness of multiple unsupervised anomaly detection methods in detecting\nVRF modifications by modeling anomalous changes as sparse additive noise. In\nthis setting we determine that statistical models comparing administrative\ndistricts within a short time span and non-negative matrix factorization are\nmost effective for surfacing anomalous events for review. These methods were\ndeployed during 2019-2020 in our organization's monitoring system and were used\nin collaboration with the office of the Iowa Secretary of State.

However, continual learning methods are\nusually prone to catastrophic forgetting. This issue is further aggravated in\nCSS where, at each step, old classes from previous iterations are collapsed\ninto the background.

For the problem of\nrobust learning under such noisy data, several algorithms have been proposed. A\nprominent class of algorithms rely on sample selection strategies, motivated by\ncurriculum learning. For example, many algorithms use the `small loss trick'\nwherein a fraction of samples with loss values below a certain threshold are\nselected for training. These algorithms are sensitive to such thresholds, and\nit is difficult to fix or learn these thresholds. Often, these algorithms also\nrequire information such as label noise rates which are typically unavailable\nin practice. In this paper, we propose a data-dependent, adaptive sample\nselection strategy that relies only on batch statistics of a given mini-batch\nto provide robustness against label noise.

This ability is of\ngreat importance in day-to-day work and special projects undertaken by\nplanners, geo-designers, and architects. In this research, we implemented a\nnovel approach to 3D building models for such matter, which included the\nintegration of geographic information systems (GIS) and 3D Computer Graphics\n(3DCG) components that generate 3D house models from building footprints\n(polygons), and the automated generation of simple and complex roof geometries\nfor rapid roof area damage reporting.

The proposed GIS and 3DCG integrated system partitions orthogonal\nbuilding polygons into a set of rectangles and places rectangular roofs and\nbox-shaped building bodies on these rectangles. Since technicians are drawing\nthese polygons manually with digitizers, depending on aerial photos, not all\nbuilding polygons are precisely orthogonal. But, when placing a set of boxes as\nbuilding bodies for creating the buildings, there may be gaps or overlaps\nbetween these boxes if building polygons are not precisely orthogonal. In our\nproposal, after approximately orthogonal building polygons are partitioned and\nrectified into a set of mutually orthogonal rectangles, each rectangle knows\nwhich rectangle is adjacent to and which edge of the rectangle is adjacent to,\nwhich will avoid unwanted intersection of windows and doors when building\nbodies combined.",

Similarly, neural networks perform a given task by learning\nfeatures of the training data set. Recently both data-driven and model-driven\nfeature extracting methods have become extremely popular and have achieved\nremarkable results. Nevertheless, practical implementations are often too slow\nto be employed in real-life scenarios, especially for real-time applications.\nWe propose a speed-up upgraded version of the classic iterative thresholding\nalgorithm, that produces a good approximation of the convolutional sparse code\nwithin 2-5 iterations. The speed advantage is gained mostly from the\nobservation that most solvers are slowed down by inefficient global\nthresholding. The main idea is to normalize each data point by the local\nreceptive field energy, before applying a threshold. This way, the natural\ninclination towards strong feature expressions is suppressed, so that one can\nrely on a global threshold that can be easily approximated, or learned during\ntraining. The proposed algorithm can be employed with a known predetermined\ndictionary, or with a trained dictionary. The trained version is implemented as\na neural net designed as the unfolding of the proposed solver. The performance\nof the proposed solution is demonstrated via the seismic inversion problem in\nboth synthetic and real data scenarios. We also provide theoretical guarantees\nfor a stable support recovery. Namely, we prove that under certain conditions\nthe true support is perfectly recovered within the first iteration.",

Recent work has\ngeneralized the traditional convolutional layer of a convolutional neural\nnetwork to non-Euclidean spaces and shown group equivariance of the generalized\nconvolution operation. In this paper, we present a novel higher order Volterra\nconvolutional neural network (VolterraNet) for data defined as samples of\nfunctions on Riemannian homogeneous spaces.

We also prove that second order functional\nconvolution operations can be represented as cascaded convolutions which leads\nto an efficient implementation. Beyond this, we also propose a dilated\nVolterraNet model. These advances lead to large parameter reductions relative\nto baseline non-Euclidean CNNs. To demonstrate the efficacy of the VolterraNet\nperformance, we present several real data experiments involving classification\ntasks on spherical-MNIST, atomic energy, Shrec17 data sets, and group testing\non diffusion MRI data.

Most of the current captioning metrics rely\non token level matching between candidate caption and the ground truth label\nsentences. It usually neglects the sentence-level information. Motivated by the\nauto-encoder mechanism and contrastive representation learning advances, we\npropose a learning-based metric for image captioning, which we call Intrinsic\nImage Captioning Evaluation($I^2CE$). We develop three progressive model\nstructures to learn the sentence level representations--single branch model,\ndual branches model, and triple branches model. Our empirical tests show that\n$I^2CE$ trained with dual branches structure achieves better consistency with\nhuman judgments to contemporary image captioning evaluation metrics.\nFurthermore, We select several state-of-the-art image captioning models and\ntest their performances on the MS COCO dataset concerning both contemporary\nmetrics and the proposed $I^2CE$.

Since the dramatic increase in amount of data puts\nforward higher requirements for the capability of real-time signal analysis, it\nis difficult for existing EMD and its variants to trade off the growth of data\ndimension and the speed of signal analysis. In order to decompose\nmulti-dimensional signals at a faster speed, we present a novel\nsignal-serialization method (serial-EMD), which concatenates multi-variate or\nmulti-dimensional signals into a one-dimensional signal and uses various\none-dimensional EMD algorithms to decompose it. To verify the effects of the\nproposed method, synthetic multi-variate time series, artificial 2D images with\nvarious textures and real-world facial images are tested. Compared with\nexisting multi-EMD algorithms, the decomposition time becomes significantly\nreduced. In addition, the results of facial recognition with Intrinsic Mode\nFunctions (IMFs) extracted using our method can achieve a higher accuracy than\nthose obtained by existing multi-EMD algorithms, which demonstrates the\nsuperior performance of our method in terms of the quality of IMFs.\nFurthermore, this method can provide a new perspective to optimize the existing\nEMD algorithms, that is, transforming the structure of the input signal rather\nthan being constrained by developing envelope computation techniques or signal\ndecomposition methods.

The corpus is growing as new born-digital\ndocuments are included, and since millions of older theses and dissertations\nhave been converted to digital form to be disseminated electronically in\ninstitutional repositories. In ETDs, as with other scholarly works, figures and\ntables can communicate a large amount of information in a concise way. Although\nmethods have been proposed for extracting figures and tables from born-digital\nPDFs, they do not work well with scanned ETDs. Considering this problem, our\nassessment of state-of-the-art figure extraction systems is that the reason\nthey do not function well on scanned PDFs is that they have only been trained\non born-digital documents. To address this limitation, we present ScanBank, a\nnew dataset containing 10 thousand scanned page images, manually labeled by\nhumans as to the presence of the 3.3 thousand figures or tables found therein.\nWe use this dataset to train a deep neural network model based on YOLOv5 to\naccurately extract figures and tables from scanned ETDs. We pose and answer\nimportant research questions aimed at finding better methods for figure\nextraction from scanned documents. One of those concerns the value for\ntraining, of data augmentation techniques applied to born-digital documents\nwhich are used to train models better suited for figure extraction from scanned\ndocuments. To the best of our knowledge, ScanBank is the first manually\nannotated dataset for figure and table extraction for scanned ETDs. A\nYOLOv5-based model, trained on ScanBank, outperforms existing comparable\nopen-source and freely available baseline methods by a considerable margin.",

    "title": "Soft Attention: Does it Actually Help to Learn Social Interactions in  Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction?",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of predicting the future path of a pedestrian using\nits motion history and the motion history of the surrounding pedestrians,\ncalled social information. Since the seminal paper on Social-LSTM,\ndeep-learning has become the main tool used to model the impact of social\ninteractions on a pedestrian's motion. The demonstration that these models can\nlearn social interactions relies on an ablative study of these models. The\nmodels are compared with and without their social interactions module on two\nstandard metrics, the Average Displacement Error and Final Displacement Error.\nYet, these complex models were recently outperformed by a simple\nconstant-velocity approach. This questions if they actually allow to model\nsocial interactions as well as the validity of the proof. In this paper, we\nfocus on the deep-learning models with a soft-attention mechanism for social\ninteraction modeling and study whether they use social information at\nprediction time. We conduct two experiments across four state-of-the-art\napproaches on the ETH and UCY datasets, which were also used in previous work.\nFirst, the models are trained by replacing the social information with random\nnoise and compared to model trained with actual social information. Second, we\nuse a gating mechanism along with a $L_0$ penalty, allowing models to shut down\ntheir inner components. The models consistently learn to prune their\nsoft-attention mechanism. For both experiments, neither the course of the\nconvergence nor the prediction performance were altered. This demonstrates that\nthe soft-attention mechanism and therefore the social information are ignored\nby the models.",

Current proficiency\ntests rely on static sets of stimulus items, and so, cannot be administered\nvalidly to the same individual multiple times. To create a proficiency test, a\nlarge number of items of \"known\" difficulty must be assembled. Multiple tests\nof equal difficulty can be constructed then using subsets of items. Here, we\nintroduce a proficiency test, the Triad Identity Matching (TIM) test, based on\nstimulus difficulty measures based on Item Response Theory (IRT). Participants\nview face-image \"triads\" (N=225) (two images of one identity and one image of a\ndifferent identity) and select the different identity. In Experiment 1,\nuniversity students (N=197) showed wide-ranging accuracy on the TIM test.\nFurthermore, IRT modeling demonstrated that the TIM test produces items of\nvarious difficulty levels. In Experiment 2, IRT-based item difficulty measures\nwere used to partition the TIM test into three equally \"easy\" and three equally\n\"difficult\" subsets. Simulation results indicated that the full set, as well as\ncurated subsets, of the TIM items yielded reliable estimates of subject\nability. In summary, the TIM test can provide a starting point for developing a\nframework that is flexible, calibrated, and adaptive to measure proficiency\nacross various ability levels (e.g., professionals or populations with face\nprocessing deficits)",

    "abstract": "With the goal of making deep learning more label-efficient, a growing number\nof papers have been studying active learning (AL) for deep models. However,\nthere are a number of issues in the prevalent experimental settings, mainly\nstemming from a lack of unified implementation and benchmarking. Issues in the\ncurrent literature include sometimes contradictory observations on the\nperformance of different AL algorithms, unintended exclusion of important\ngeneralization approaches such as data augmentation and SGD for optimization, a\nlack of study of evaluation facets like the labeling efficiency of AL, and\nlittle or no clarity on the scenarios in which AL outperforms random sampling\n(RS). In this work, we present a unified re-implementation of state-of-the-art\nAL algorithms in the context of image classification, and we carefully study\nthese issues as facets of effective evaluation. On the positive side, we show\nthat AL techniques are 2x to 4x more label-efficient compared to RS with the\nuse of data augmentation. Surprisingly, when data augmentation is included,\nthere is no longer a consistent gain in using BADGE, a state-of-the-art\napproach, over simple uncertainty sampling. We then do a careful analysis of\nhow existing approaches perform with varying amounts of redundancy and number\nof examples per class. Finally, we provide several insights for AL\npractitioners to consider in future work, such as the effect of the AL batch\nsize, the effect of initialization, the importance of retraining a new model at\nevery round, and other insights.",

Various techniques using conventional network\narchitectures have been proposed for the same. However, the body of research\nwork is limited and there are various issues like using inefficient 3D\nrepresentation formats, weak 3D model generation backbones, inability to\ngenerate dense point clouds, dependence of post-processing for generation of\ndense point clouds, and dependence on silhouettes in RGB images. In this paper,\na novel 2D RGB image to point cloud conversion technique is proposed, which\nimproves the state of art in the field due to its efficient, robust and simple\nmodel by using the concept of parallelization in network architecture. It not\nonly uses the efficient and rich 3D representation of point clouds, but also\nuses a novel and robust point cloud generation backbone in order to address the\nprevalent issues. This involves using a single-encoder multiple-decoder deep\nnetwork architecture wherein each decoder generates certain fixed viewpoints.\nThis is followed by fusing all the viewpoints to generate a dense point cloud.\nVarious experiments are conducted on the technique and its performance is\ncompared with those of other state of the art techniques and impressive gains\nin performance are demonstrated.

    "abstract": "We study a practical domain adaptation task, called source-free unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (UDA) problem, in which we cannot access source domain data\ndue to data privacy issues but only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled\ntarget data are available. This task, however, is very difficult due to one key\nchallenge: the lack of source data and target domain labels makes model\nadaptation very challenging. To address this, we propose to mine the hidden\nknowledge in the source model and exploit it to generate source avatar\nprototypes (i.e., representative features for each source class) as well as\ntarget pseudo labels for domain alignment. To this end, we propose a\nContrastive Prototype Generation and Adaptation (CPGA) method. Specifically,\nCPGA consists of two stages: (1) prototype generation: by exploring the\nclassification boundary information of the source model, we train a prototype\ngenerator to generate avatar prototypes via contrastive learning. (2) prototype\nadaptation: based on the generated source prototypes and target pseudo labels,\nwe develop a new robust contrastive prototype adaptation strategy to align each\npseudo-labeled target data to the corresponding source prototypes.

Each new model trained with DP increases\nthe bound on data leakage and can be seen as consuming part of a global privacy\nbudget that should not be exceeded. This budget is a scarce resource that must\nbe carefully managed to maximize the number of successfully trained models.\nWe describe PrivateKube, an extension to the popular Kubernetes datacenter\norchestrator that adds privacy as a new type of resource to be managed\nalongside other traditional compute resources, such as CPU, GPU, and memory.\nThe abstractions we design for the privacy resource mirror those defined by\nKubernetes for traditional resources, but there are also major differences.

    "abstract": "Image inpainting is one of the important tasks in computer vision which\nfocuses on the reconstruction of missing regions in an image. The aim of this\npaper is to introduce an image inpainting model based on Wasserstein Generative\nAdversarial Imputation Network. The generator network of the model uses\nbuilding blocks of convolutional layers with different dilation rates, together\nwith skip connections that help the model reproduce fine details of the output.\nThis combination yields a universal imputation model that is able to handle\nvarious scenarios of missingness with sufficient quality. To show this\nexperimentally, the model is simultaneously trained to deal with three\nscenarios given by missing pixels at random, missing various smaller square\nregions, and one missing square placed in the center of the image. It turns out\nthat our model achieves high-quality inpainting results on all scenarios.\nPerformance is evaluated using peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural\nsimilarity index on two real-world benchmark datasets, CelebA faces and Paris\nStreetView. The results of our model are compared to biharmonic imputation and\nto some of the other state-of-the-art image inpainting methods.",

    "abstract": "Subscription services face a difficult problem when estimating the causal\nimpact of content launches on acquisition. Customers buy subscriptions, not\nindividual pieces of content, and once subscribed they may consume many pieces\nof content in addition to the one(s) that drew them to the service. In this\npaper, we propose a scalable methodology to estimate the incremental\nacquisition impact of content launches in a subscription business model when\nrandomized experimentation is not feasible. Our approach uses simple\nassumptions to transform the problem into an equivalent question: what is the\nexpected consumption rate for new subscribers who did not join due to the\ncontent launch? We estimate this counterfactual rate using the consumption rate\nof new subscribers who joined just prior to launch, while making adjustments\nfor variation related to subscriber attributes, the in-product experience, and\nseasonality. We then compare our counterfactual consumption to the actual rate\nin order to back out an acquisition estimate. Our methodology provides top-line\nimpact estimates at the content / day / region grain. Additionally, to enable\nsubscriber-level attribution, we present an algorithm that assigns specific\nindividual accounts to add up to the top-line estimate. Subscriber-level\nattribution is derived by solving an optimization problem to minimize the\nnumber of subscribers attributed to more than one piece of content, while\nmaximizing the average propensity to be incremental for subscribers attributed\nto each piece of content. Finally, in the absence of definitive ground truth,\nwe present several validation methods which can be used to assess the\nplausibility of impact estimates generated by these methods.",

    "abstract": "Critical role of Internet of Things (IoT) in various domains like smart city,\nhealthcare, supply chain and transportation has made them the target of\nmalicious attacks. Past works in this area focused on centralized Intrusion\nDetection System (IDS), assuming the existence of a central entity to perform\ndata analysis and identify threats. However, such IDS may not always be\nfeasible, mainly due to spread of data across multiple sources and gathering at\ncentral node can be costly. Also, the earlier works primarily focused on\nimproving True Positive Rate (TPR) and ignored the False Positive Rate (FPR),\nwhich is also essential to avoid unnecessary downtime of the systems. In this\npaper, we first present an architecture for IDS based on hybrid ensemble model,\nnamed PHEC, which gives improved performance compared to state-of-the-art\narchitectures. We then adapt this model to a federated learning framework that\nperforms local training and aggregates only the model parameters. Next, we\npropose Noise-Tolerant PHEC in centralized and federated settings to address\nthe label-noise problem. The proposed idea uses classifiers using weighted\nconvex surrogate loss functions. Natural robustness of KNN classifier towards\nnoisy data is also used in the proposed architecture. Experimental results on\nfour benchmark datasets drawn from various security attacks show that our model\nachieves high TPR while keeping FPR low on noisy and clean data. Further, they\nalso demonstrate that the hybrid ensemble models achieve performance in\nfederated settings close to that of the centralized settings.",

    "abstract": "Scientific and engineering problems often require the use of artificial\nintelligence to aid understanding and the search for promising designs. While\nGaussian processes (GP) stand out as easy-to-use and interpretable learners,\nthey have difficulties in accommodating big datasets, categorical inputs, and\nmultiple responses, which has become a common challenge for a growing number of\ndata-driven design applications. In this paper, we propose a GP model that\nutilizes latent variables and functions obtained through variational inference\nto address the aforementioned challenges simultaneously. The method is built\nupon the latent variable Gaussian process (LVGP) model where categorical\nfactors are mapped into a continuous latent space to enable GP modeling of\nmixed-variable datasets. By extending variational inference to LVGP models, the\nlarge training dataset is replaced by a small set of inducing points to address\nthe scalability issue. Output response vectors are represented by a linear\ncombination of independent latent functions, forming a flexible kernel\nstructure to handle multiple responses that might have distinct behaviors.\nComparative studies demonstrate that the proposed method scales well for large\ndatasets with over 10^4 data points, while outperforming state-of-the-art\nmachine learning methods without requiring much hyperparameter tuning. In\naddition, an interpretable latent space is obtained to draw insights into the\neffect of categorical factors, such as those associated with building blocks of\narchitectures and element choices in metamaterial and materials design.

However, the single-step adversarial training is\nmost likely to cause catastrophic overfitting, as after a few training epochs\nit will be hard to generate strong adversarial examples to continuously boost\nthe adversarial robustness. In this work, we aim to avoid the catastrophic\noverfitting by introducing multi-step adversarial examples during the\nsingle-step adversarial training. Then, to balance the large training overhead\nof generating multi-step adversarial examples, we propose a Multi-stage\nOptimization based Adversarial Training (MOAT) method that periodically trains\nthe model on mixed benign examples, single-step adversarial examples, and\nmulti-step adversarial examples stage by stage. In this way, the overall\ntraining overhead is reduced significantly, meanwhile, the model could avoid\ncatastrophic overfitting.

    "abstract": "TANet is one of state-of-the-art 3D object detection method on KITTI and JRDB\nbenchmark, the network contains a Triple Attention module and Coarse-to-Fine\nRegression module to improve the robustness and accuracy of 3D Detection.\nHowever, since the original input data (point clouds) contains a lot of noise\nduring collecting the data, which will further affect the training of the\nmodel. For example, the object is far from the robot, the sensor is difficult\nto obtain enough pointcloud. If the objects only contains few point clouds, and\nthe samples are fed into model with the normal samples together during\ntraining, the detector will be difficult to distinguish the individual with few\npointcloud belong to object or background. In this paper, we propose TANet++ to\nimprove the performance on 3D Detection, which adopt a novel training strategy\non training the TANet. In order to reduce the negative impact by the weak\nsamples, the training strategy previously filtered the training data, and then\nthe TANet++ is trained by the rest of data. The experimental results shows that\nAP score of TANet++ is 8.98\\% higher than TANet on JRDB benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is one of the most popular and\nwidely-adopted meta-learning algorithms nowadays, which achieves remarkable\nsuccess in various learning problems. Yet, with the unique design of nested\ninner-loop and outer-loop updates which respectively govern the task-specific\nand meta-model-centric learning, the underlying learning objective of MAML\nstill remains implicit and thus impedes a more straightforward understanding of\nit. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to the working mechanism of\nMAML and discover that: MAML is analogous to a meta-learner using a supervised\ncontrastive objective function, where the query features are pulled towards the\nsupport features of the same class and against those of different classes, in\nwhich such contrastiveness is experimentally verified via an analysis based on\nthe cosine similarity. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the vanilla MAML\nalgorithm has an undesirable interference term originating from the random\ninitialization and the cross-task interaction. We therefore propose a simple\nbut effective technique, zeroing trick, to alleviate such interference, where\nthe extensive experiments are then conducted on both miniImagenet and Omniglot\ndatasets to demonstrate the consistent improvement brought by our proposed\ntechnique thus well validating its effectiveness.",

However, most of existing STISR methods\nregard text images as natural scene images, ignoring the categorical\ninformation of text. In this paper, we make an inspiring attempt to embed\ncategorical text prior into STISR model training. Specifically, we adopt the\ncharacter probability sequence as the text prior, which can be obtained\nconveniently from a text recognition model. The text prior provides categorical\nguidance to recover high-resolution (HR) text images. On the other hand, the\nreconstructed HR image can refine the text prior in return. Finally, we present\na multi-stage text prior guided super-resolution (TPGSR) framework for STISR.\nOur experiments on the benchmark TextZoom dataset show that TPGSR can not only\neffectively improve the visual quality of scene text images, but also\nsignificantly improve the text recognition accuracy over existing STISR\nmethods. Our model trained on TextZoom also demonstrates certain generalization\ncapability to the LR images in other datasets.",

In turn, deep\nreinforcement learning provides effective means to address myopia by estimating\nhow much discounted cumulated future reward states promise. In this work, we\nleverage deep reinforcement learning to accelerate the learning of concepts in\n$\\mathcal{ALC}$ by proposing DRILL -- a novel class expression learning\napproach that uses a convolutional deep Q-learning model to steer its search.\nBy virtue of its architecture, DRILL is able to compute the expected discounted\ncumulated future reward of more than $10^3$ class expressions in a second on\nstandard hardware. We evaluate DRILL on four benchmark datasets against\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

To begin with, by exploring structural\nobservability of large-scale Boolean networks (LSBNs), an underlying type of\nSOGs is provided based on a recent observability criterion of conjunctive BNs.\nBesides, SOGs are also proved to have important applicability to structural\nobservability of general discrete-time systems. Further, two minimum\nrealization strategies are considered to induce an SOG from an arbitrarily\ngiven digraph by marking and controlling the minimal vertices, respectively. It\nindicates that one can induce an observable system by means of adding the\nminimal sensors or modifying the adjacency relation of minimal vertices.\nFinally, the structural observability of finite-field networks, and the minimum\npinned node theorem for Boolean networks are displayed as application and\nsimulation. The most salient superiority is that the designed algorithms are\npolynomial time and avoid exhaustive brute-force searches.

The policy is implicitly defined on these optimal\nvalue estimates, rather than being decomposed among the subtasks. As a\nconsequence, our approach can learn the globally optimal policy, and does not\nsuffer from the non-stationarity of high-level decisions. If several partitions\nhave equivalent dynamics, the subtasks of those partitions can be shared.

Cloud\nService Providers (CSP) must be fully trusted to not tamper with or disclose\nprocessed data, hampering adoption of cloud services for many sensitive or\ncritical applications. As a result, CSPs and CPU manufacturers are rushing to\nfind solutions for secure outsourced computation in the Cloud. While enclaves,\nlike Intel SGX, are strongly limited in terms of throughput and size, AMD's\nSecure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) offers hardware support for transparently\nprotecting code and data of entire VMs, thus removing the performance, memory\nand software adaption barriers of enclaves. Through attestation of boot code\nintegrity and means for securely transferring secrets into an encrypted VM,\nCSPs are effectively removed from the list of trusted entities. There have been\nseveral attacks on the security of SEV, by abusing I/O channels to encrypt and\ndecrypt data, or by moving encrypted code blocks at runtime. Yet, none of these\nattacks have targeted the attestation protocol, the core of the secure\ncomputing environment created by SEV. We show that the current attestation\nmechanism of Zen 1 and Zen 2 architectures has a significant flaw, allowing us\nto manipulate the loaded code without affecting the attestation outcome. An\nattacker may abuse this weakness to inject arbitrary code at startup -- and\nthus take control over the entire VM execution, without any indication to the\nVM's owner. Our attack primitives allow the attacker to do extensive\nmodifications to the bootloader and the operating system, like injecting spy\ncode or extracting secret data. We present a full end-to-end attack, from the\ninitial exploit to leaking the key of the encrypted disk image during boot,\ngiving the attacker unthrottled access to all of the VM's persistent data.",

In addition,\nthe design and testing of complex systems, e.g., robots, which often employ\ndeep learning-based perception models, may face severe difficulties as even\nstate-of-the-art methods trained on real and large-scale datasets cannot always\nperform adequately as they have not adapted to the visual differences between\nthe virtual and the real world data. As an attempt to tackle and mitigate the\neffect of these issues, we present a method that automatically generates\nrealistic synthetic data with annotations for a) person detection, b) face\nrecognition, and c) human pose estimation. The proposed method takes as input\nreal background images and populates them with human figures in various poses.\nInstead of using hand-made 3D human models, we propose the use of models\ngenerated through deep learning methods, further reducing the dataset creation\ncosts, while maintaining a high level of realism. In addition, we provide\nopen-source and easy to use tools that implement the proposed pipeline,\nallowing for generating highly-realistic synthetic datasets for a variety of\ntasks. A benchmarking and evaluation in the corresponding tasks shows that\nsynthetic data can be effectively used as a supplement to real data.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization is a promising methodology for analog circuit\nsynthesis. However, the sequential nature of the Bayesian optimization\nframework significantly limits its ability to fully utilize real-world\ncomputational resources. In this paper, we propose an efficient parallelizable\nBayesian optimization algorithm via Multi-objective ACquisition function\nEnsemble (MACE) to further accelerate the optimization procedure. By sampling\nquery points from the Pareto front of the probability of improvement (PI),\nexpected improvement (EI) and lower confidence bound (LCB), we combine the\nbenefits of state-of-the-art acquisition functions to achieve a delicate\ntradeoff between exploration and exploitation for the unconstrained\noptimization problem. Based on this batch design, we further adjust the\nalgorithm for the constrained optimization problem. By dividing the\noptimization procedure into two stages and first focusing on finding an initial\nfeasible point, we manage to gain more information about the valid region and\ncan better avoid sampling around the infeasible area. After achieving the first\nfeasible point, we favor the feasible region by adopting a specially designed\npenalization term to the acquisition function ensemble. The experimental\nresults quantitatively demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce the\noverall simulation time by up to 74 times compared to differential evolution\n(DE) for the unconstrained optimization problem when the batch size is 15. For\nthe constrained optimization problem, our proposed algorithm can speed up the\noptimization process by up to 15 times compared to the weighted expected\nimprovement based Bayesian optimization (WEIBO) approach, when the batch size\nis 15.",

We argue that\nthis sequential scheme does not ensure these two tasks fully benefit each\nother, and present an Iterative Mutual Enhancement Network (IMENet) to solve\nthem jointly, which interactively refines the two tasks at the late prediction\nstage.

    "abstract": "With the wide adoption of black-box models, instance-based \\emph{post hoc}\nexplanation tools, such as LIME and SHAP became increasingly popular. These\ntools produce explanations, pinpointing contributions of key features\nassociated with a given prediction. However, the obtained explanations remain\nat the raw feature level and are not necessarily understandable by a human\nexpert without extensive domain knowledge. We propose ReEx (Reasoning with\nExplanations), a method applicable to explanations generated by arbitrary\ninstance-level explainers, such as SHAP. By using background knowledge in the\nform of ontologies, ReEx generalizes instance explanations in a least general\ngeneralization-like manner. The resulting symbolic descriptions are specific\nfor individual classes and offer generalizations based on the explainer's\noutput. The derived semantic explanations are potentially more informative, as\nthey describe the key attributes in the context of more general background\nknowledge, e.g., at the biological process level. We showcase ReEx's\nperformance on nine biological data sets, showing that compact, semantic\nexplanations can be obtained and are more informative than generic ontology\nmappings that link terms directly to feature names. ReEx is offered as a\nsimple-to-use Python library and is compatible with tools such as SHAP and\nsimilar. To our knowledge, this is one of the first methods that directly\ncouples semantic reasoning with contemporary model explanation methods. This\npaper is a preprint.

    "abstract": "Electronic health record (EHR) coding is the task of assigning ICD codes to\neach EHR. Most previous studies either only focus on the frequent ICD codes or\ntreat rare and frequent ICD codes in the same way. These methods perform well\non frequent ICD codes but due to the extremely unbalanced distribution of ICD\ncodes, the performance on rare ones is far from satisfactory. We seek to\nimprove the performance for both frequent and rare ICD codes by using a\ncontrastive graph-based EHR coding framework, CoGraph, which re-casts EHR\ncoding as a few-shot learning task. First, we construct a heterogeneous EHR\nword-entity (HEWE) graph for each EHR, where the words and entities extracted\nfrom an EHR serve as nodes and the relations between them serve as edges. Then,\nCoGraph learns similarities and dissimilarities between HEWE graphs from\ndifferent ICD codes so that information can be transferred among them. In a\nfew-shot learning scenario, the model only has access to frequent ICD codes\nduring training, which might force it to encode features that are useful for\nfrequent ICD codes only. To mitigate this risk, CoGraph devises two graph\ncontrastive learning schemes, GSCL and GECL, that exploit the HEWE graph\nstructures so as to encode transferable features. GSCL utilizes the\nintra-correlation of different sub-graphs sampled from HEWE graphs while GECL\nexploits the inter-correlation among HEWE graphs at different clinical stages.\nExperiments on the MIMIC-III benchmark dataset show that CoGraph significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on EHR coding, not only on frequent ICD\ncodes, but also on rare codes, in terms of several evaluation indicators. On\nfrequent ICD codes, GSCL and GECL improve the classification accuracy and F1 by\n1.31% and 0.61%, respectively, and on rare ICD codes CoGraph has more obvious\nimprovements by 2.12% and 2.95%.",

    "abstract": "Open-source, Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) are emerging as\nalternatives to the popular yet centralized and profit-driven platforms like\nFacebook or Twitter. In DOSNs, users can set up their own server, or instance,\nwhile they can actually interact with users of other instances. Moreover, by\nadopting the same communication protocol, DOSNs become part of a massive social\nnetwork, namely the Fediverse. Mastodon is the most relevant platform in the\nFediverse to date, and also the one that has attracted attention from the\nresearch community. Existing studies are however limited to an analysis of a\nrelatively outdated sample of Mastodon focusing on few aspects at a user level,\nwhile several open questions have not been answered yet, especially at the\ninstance level. In this work, we aim at pushing forward our understanding of\nthe Fediverse by leveraging the primary role of Mastodon therein. Our first\ncontribution is the building of an up-to-date and highly representative dataset\nof Mastodon. Upon this new data, we have defined a network model over Mastodon\ninstances and exploited it to investigate three major aspects: the structural\nfeatures of the Mastodon network of instances from a macroscopic as well as a\nmesoscopic perspective, to unveil the distinguishing traits of the underlying\nfederative mechanism; the backbone of the network, to discover the essential\ninterrelations between the instances; and the growth of Mastodon, to understand\nhow the shape of the instance network has evolved during the last few years,\nalso when broading the scope to account for instances belonging to other\nplatforms. Our extensive analysis of the above aspects has provided a number of\nfindings that reveal distinguishing features of Mastodon and that can be used\nas a starting point for the discovery of all the DOSN Fediverse.",

While the impact of label noise on learning in deep\nneural networks has been studied in prior work, these studies have exclusively\nfocused on homogeneous label noise, i.e., the degree of label noise is the same\nacross all categories. However, in the real-world, label noise is often\nheterogeneous, with some categories being affected to a greater extent than\nothers. Here, we address this gap in the literature. We hypothesized that\nheterogeneous label noise would only affect the classes that had label noise\nunless there was transfer from those classes to the classes without label\nnoise. To test this hypothesis, we designed a series of computer vision studies\nusing MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MS-COCO where we imposed heterogeneous\nlabel noise during the training of multi-class, multi-task, and multi-label\nsystems.

Most existing\nworks focus on analyzing the queueing and workload processing latencies\nassociated with fog computing, ignoring the fact that wireless access latency\ncan sometimes dominate the overall latency. This motivates the work in this\npaper, where we report on a five-month measurement study of the wireless access\nlatency between connected vehicles and a fog/cloud computing system supported\nby commercially available LTE networks. We propose AdaptiveFog, a novel\nframework for autonomous and dynamic switching between different LTE networks\nthat implement a fog/cloud infrastructure. AdaptiveFog's main objective is to\nmaximize the service confidence level, defined as the probability that the\nlatency of a given service type is below some threshold. To quantify the\nperformance gap between different LTE networks, we introduce a novel\nstatistical distance metric, called weighted Kantorovich-Rubinstein (K-R)\ndistance. Two scenarios based on finite- and infinite-horizon optimization of\nshort-term and long-term confidence are investigated. For each scenario, a\nsimple threshold policy based on weighted K-R distance is proposed and proved\nto maximize the latency confidence for smart vehicles. Extensive analysis and\nsimulations are performed based on our latency measurements.

    "abstract": "Federated learning aims to learn a global model that performs well on client\ndevices with limited cross-client communication. Personalized federated\nlearning (PFL) further extends this setup to handle data heterogeneity between\nclients by learning personalized models. A key challenge in this setting is to\nlearn effectively across clients even though each client has unique data that\nis often limited in size. Here we present pFedGP, a solution to PFL that is\nbased on Gaussian processes (GPs) with deep kernel learning. GPs are highly\nexpressive models that work well in the low data regime due to their Bayesian\nnature. However, applying GPs to PFL raises multiple challenges. Mainly, GPs\nperformance depends heavily on access to a good kernel function, and learning a\nkernel requires a large training set. Therefore, we propose learning a shared\nkernel function across all clients, parameterized by a neural network, with a\npersonal GP classifier for each client. We further extend pFedGP to include\ninducing points using two novel methods, the first helps to improve\ngeneralization in the low data regime and the second reduces the computational\ncost. We derive a PAC-Bayes generalization bound on novel clients and\nempirically show that it gives non-vacuous guarantees. Extensive experiments on\nstandard PFL benchmarks with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10, and on a new\nsetup of learning under input noise show that pFedGP achieves well-calibrated\npredictions while significantly outperforming baseline methods, reaching up to\n21% in accuracy gain.",

    "abstract": "Given a set of multiple point clouds, how to find the rigid transformations\n(rotation, reflection, and shifting) such that these point clouds are well\naligned? This problem, known as the generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem\n(GOPP), plays a fundamental role in several scientific disciplines including\nstatistics, imaging science and computer vision. Despite its tremendous\npractical importance, it is still a challenging computational problem due to\nthe inherent nonconvexity. In this paper, we study the semidefinite programming\n(SDP) relaxation of the generalized orthogonal Procrustes problems and prove\nthat the tightness of the SDP relaxation holds, i.e., the SDP estimator exactly\nequals the least squares estimator, if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is\nrelatively large. We also prove that an efficient generalized power method with\na proper initialization enjoys global linear convergence to the least squares\nestimator. In addition, we analyze the Burer-Monteiro factorization and show\nthe corresponding optimization landscape is free of spurious local optima if\nthe SNR is large. This explains why first-order Riemannian gradient methods\nwith random initializations usually produce a satisfactory solution despite the\nnonconvexity. One highlight of our work is that the theoretical guarantees are\npurely algebraic and do not require any assumptions on the statistical property\nof the noise. Our results partially resolve one open problem posed in\n[Bandeira, Khoo, Singer, 2014] on the tightness of the SDP relaxation in\nsolving the generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem.

    "abstract": "Having access to an exploring restart distribution (the so-called wide\ncoverage assumption) is critical with policy gradient methods. This is due to\nthe fact that, while the objective function is insensitive to updates in\nunlikely states, the agent may still need improvements in those states in order\nto reach a nearly optimal payoff. For this reason, wide coverage is used in\nsome form when analyzing theoretical properties of practical policy gradient\nmethods. However, this assumption can be unfeasible in certain environments,\nfor instance when learning is online, or when restarts are possible only from a\nfixed initial state. In these cases, classical policy gradient algorithms can\nhave very poor convergence properties and sample efficiency. In this paper, we\ndevelop Curious Explorer, a novel and simple iterative state space exploration\nstrategy that can be used with any starting distribution $\\rho$. Curious\nExplorer starts from $\\rho$, then using intrinsic rewards assigned to the set\nof poorly visited states produces a sequence of policies, each one more\nexploratory than the previous one in an informed way, and finally outputs a\nrestart model $\\mu$ based on the state visitation distribution of the\nexploratory policies. Curious Explorer is provable, in the sense that we\nprovide theoretical upper bounds on how often an optimal policy visits poorly\nvisited states. These bounds can be used to prove PAC convergence and sample\nefficiency results when a PAC optimizer is plugged in Curious Explorer. This\nallows to achieve global convergence and sample efficiency results without any\ncoverage assumption for REINFORCE, and potentially for any other policy\ngradient method ensuring PAC convergence with wide coverage. Finally, we plug\n(the output of) Curious Explorer into REINFORCE and TRPO, and show empirically\nthat it can improve performance in MDPs with challenging exploration.",

Specifically, the generative model\nlearns to approximate the distribution of anomalous samples from the candidate\nset of graph snapshots, and the discriminative model detects whether the\nsampled snapshot is from the ground-truth or not. Experiments on 4 real-world\nnetworks show that GraphAnoGAN outperforms 6 baselines with a significant\nmargin (28.29% and 22.01% higher precision and recall, respectively compared to\nthe best baseline, averaged across all datasets).",

While primarily run on\nCPUs in HPC clusters, these algorithms have been shown to scale in performance\nwhen developed to be run on massively parallel architectures such as GPUs.\nWhile parallelizing existing SBI algorithms provides us with performance gains,\nthis might not be the most efficient way to utilize the achieved parallelism.\nThis work proposes a new algorithm, that builds on an existing SBI method -\nApproximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo(ABC-SMC). This new\nalgorithm is designed to utilize the parallelism not only for performance gain,\nbut also toward qualitative benefits in the learnt parameters. The key idea is\nto replace the notion of a single 'step-size' hyperparameter, which governs how\nthe state space of parameters is explored during learning, with step-sizes\nsampled from a tuned Beta distribution. This allows this new ABC-SMC algorithm\nto more efficiently explore the state-space of the parameters being learnt. We\ntest the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to learn parameters for an\nepidemiology model running on a Tesla T4 GPU. Compared to the parallelized\nstate-of-the-art SBI algorithm, we get similar quality results in $\\sim 100$x\nfewer simulations and observe ~80x lower run-to-run variance across 10\nindependent trials.",

Experimental studies on real datasets abound\nand, to some extent, there are also studies regarding their control of false\npositive rate (Type I error). However, assessment of their power, i.e., their\nability to identify true similarity, has been limited to some members or\nvariants of the \\Dd family and the asymptotic theoretic results have been\ncomplemented by experimental studies on short sequences, not adequate for\ncurrent genome-scale applications. Such a State of the Art is methodologically\nproblematic, since information regarding a key feature such as power is either\nmissing or limited.\nResults: By concentrating on histogram-based AF functions, we perform the\nfirst coherent and uniform evaluation of the power of those functions,\ninvolving also Type I error for completeness. The experiments carried out are\nextensive, as we use two Alternative models of important genomic features (CIS\nRegulatory Modules and Horizontal Gene Transfer), sequence lengths from a few\nthousand to millions and different values of $k$. As a result, and using power,\nwe provide a characterization of those AF functions that is novel and\ninformative. Indeed, we identify weak and strong points of each function\nconsidered, which may be used as a guide to choose one for analysis tasks.

    "abstract": "Seminal works on light spanners over the years provide spanners with optimal\nor near-optimal lightness in various graph classes, such as in general graphs,\nEuclidean spanners, and minor-free graphs. Two shortcomings of all previous\nwork on light spanners are: (1) The techniques are ad hoc per graph class, and\nthus can't be applied broadly (e.g., some require large stretch and are thus\nsuitable to general graphs, while others are naturally suitable to stretch $1 +\n\\epsilon$). (2) The runtimes of these constructions are almost always\nsub-optimal, and usually far from optimal.\nThis work aims at initiating a unified theory of light spanners by presenting\na single framework that can be used to construct light spanners in a variety of\ngraph classes. This theory is developed in two papers. The current paper is the\nfirst of the two -- it lays the foundations of the theory of light spanners and\nthen applies it to design fast constructions with optimal lightness for several\ngraph classes. Our new constructions are significantly faster than the\nstate-of-the-art for every examined graph class; moreover, our runtimes are\nnear-linear and usually optimal.\nSpecifically, this paper includes the following results: (i) An $O(m\n\\alpha(m,n))$ -time construction of $(2k-1)(1+\\epsilon)$-spanner with lightness\n$O(n^{1/k})$ for general graphs; (ii) An $O(n\\log n)$-time construction of\nEuclidean $(1+\\epsilon)$-spanners with lightness and degree both bounded by\nconstants in the basic algebraic computation tree (ACT) model. This\nconstruction resolves a major problem in the area of geometric spanners, which\nwas open for three decades; (ii) An $O(n\\log n)$-time construction of\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-spanners with constant lightness and degree, in the ACT model\nfor unit disk graphs; (iv) a linear-time algorithm for constructing\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-spanners with constant lightness for minor-free graphs.",

Myocardial segmentation of\nMyocardial Contrast Echocardiography (MCE), a critical task in automatic\nmyocardial perfusion analysis, is an example. Due to the low resolution and\nserious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can\nvary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,\nhow can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we\ntrain the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by\nproposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation\nperformance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our\nproposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new\nmetric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn\ngeneral features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set\ndemonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function\noutperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from\nmultiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

To reduce their financial burden on the world economy and to\nenhance their quality of life, it is essential to develop technology-based\nsolutions that are adaptive, assistive and intelligent in nature. Intelligent\nAffect Aware Systems that can not only analyze but also predict the behavior of\nelderly people in the context of their day to day interactions with technology\nin an IoT-based environment, holds immense potential for serving as a long-term\nsolution for improving the user experience of elderly in smart homes. This work\ntherefore proposes the framework for an Intelligent Affect Aware environment\nfor elderly people that can not only analyze the affective components of their\ninteractions but also predict their likely user experience even before they\nstart engaging in any activity in the given smart home environment. This\nforecasting of user experience would provide scope for enhancing the same,\nthereby increasing the assistive and adaptive nature of such intelligent\nsystems. To uphold the efficacy of this proposed framework for improving the\nquality of life of elderly people in smart homes, it has been tested on three\ndatasets and the results are presented and discussed.",

In this paper, we investigate speculative type confusion, a\nSpectre v1 attack vector in which branch mispredictions make the victim execute\nwith variables holding values of the wrong type and thereby leak memory\ncontent.\nWe observe that speculative type confusion can be inadvertently introduced by\na compiler, making it extremely hard for programmers to reason about security\nand manually apply Spectre mitigations. We thus set out to determine the extent\nto which speculative type confusion affects the Linux kernel. Our analysis\nfinds exploitable and potentially-exploitable arbitrary memory disclosure\nvulnerabilities. We also find many latent vulnerabilities, which could become\nexploitable due to innocuous system changes, such as coding style changes.\nOur results suggest that Spectre mitigations which rely on\nstatically/manually identifying \"bad\" code patterns need to be rethought, and\nmore comprehensive mitigations are needed.",

As an alternative\napproach, recent methods rely on limited supervision to disentangle the factors\nof variation and allow their identifiability. While annotating the true\ngenerative factors is only required for a limited number of observations, we\nargue that it is infeasible to enumerate all the factors of variation that\ndescribe a real-world image distribution. To this end, we propose a method for\ndisentangling a set of factors which are only partially labeled, as well as\nseparating the complementary set of residual factors that are never explicitly\nspecified.

This work studies an important aspect of these methods: splitting the\ndata from each task into train (support) and validation (query) sets during\nmeta-training. Inspired by recent work (Raghu et al., 2020), we view such\nmeta-learning methods through the lens of representation learning and argue\nthat the train-validation split encourages the learned representation to be\nlow-rank without compromising on expressivity, as opposed to the non-splitting\nvariant that encourages high-rank representations. Since sample efficiency\nbenefits from low-rankness, the splitting strategy will require very few\nsamples to solve unseen test tasks. We present theoretical results that\nformalize this idea for linear representation learning on a subspace\nmeta-learning instance, and experimentally verify this practical benefit of\nsplitting in simulations and on standard meta-learning benchmarks.",

The high-level dynamics has a multiplicative uncertainty in the\ncontrol input effectiveness and is subjected to an exogenous disturbance input.\nOn the other hand, the low-level system is subjected to actuator faults causing\na time-varying multiplicative uncertainty in the dynamical model and associated\ncontrol effectiveness. Moreover, the nonlinear coupling between the high-level\nand the low-level dynamics makes the problem even more challenging. To address\nthis problem, an online parameter estimation algorithm is designed, coupled\nwith an adaptive splitting mechanism which automatically distributes the\ncontrol action among low level multi-agent systems.

Previous works demonstrate that test-time adaptation to data\nshift, for instance using entropy minimization, effectively improves\nperformance on such shifted distributions. This paper focuses on the fully\ntest-time adaptation setting, where only unlabeled data from the target\ndistribution is required. This allows adapting arbitrary pretrained networks.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel loss that improves test-time adaptation by\naddressing both premature convergence and instability of entropy minimization.\nThis is achieved by replacing the entropy by a non-saturating surrogate and\nadding a diversity regularizer based on batch-wise entropy maximization that\nprevents convergence to trivial collapsed solutions. Moreover, we propose to\nprepend an input transformation module to the network that can partially undo\ntest-time distribution shifts. Surprisingly, this preprocessing can be learned\nsolely using the fully test-time adaptation loss in an end-to-end fashion\nwithout any target domain labels or source domain data.

For each class of problems, this paper presents\ntwo HJ equations: one for time-varying dynamics, cost, and state constraint;\nthe other for time-invariant dynamics, cost, and state constraint.

    "abstract": "Dictionary methods for system identification typically rely on one set of\nmeasurements to learn governing dynamics of a system. In this paper, we\ninvestigate how fusion of output measurements with state measurements affects\nthe dictionary selection process in Koopman operator learning problems. While\nprior methods use dynamical conjugacy to show a direct link between Koopman\neigenfunctions in two distinct data spaces (measurement channels), we explore\nthe specific case where output measurements are nonlinear, non-invertible\nfunctions of the system state. This setup reflects the measurement constraints\nof many classes of physical systems, e.g., biological measurement data, where\none type of measurement does not directly transform to another. We propose\noutput constrained Koopman operators (OC-KOs) as a new framework to fuse two\nmeasurement sets. We show that OC-KOs are effective for sensor fusion by\nproving that when learning a Koopman operator, output measurement functions\nserve to constrain the space of potential Koopman observables and their\neigenfunctions. Further, low-dimensional output measurements can be embedded to\ninform selection of Koopman dictionary functions for high-dimensional models.\nWe propose two algorithms to identify OC-KO representations directly from data:\na direct optimization method that uses state and output data simultaneously and\na sequential optimization method. We prove a theorem to show that the solution\nspaces of the two optimization problems are equivalent. We illustrate these\nfindings with a theoretical example and two numerical simulations.",

FedAvg\nand FedProx are two widely adopted algorithms. However, recent work raised\nconcerns on these two methods: (1) their fixed points do not correspond to the\nstationary points of the original optimization problem, and (2) the common\nmodel found might not generalize well locally.\nIn this paper, we alleviate these concerns. Towards this, we adopt the\nstatistical learning perspective yet allow the distributions to be\nheterogeneous and the local data to be unbalanced. We show, in the general\nkernel regression setting, that both FedAvg and FedProx converge to the\nminimax-optimal error rates. Moreover, when the kernel function has a finite\nrank, the convergence is exponentially fast. Our results further analytically\nquantify the impact of the model heterogeneity and characterize the federation\ngain - the reduction of the estimation error for a worker to join the federated\nlearning compared to the best local estimator. To the best of our knowledge, we\nare the first to show the achievability of minimax error rates under FedAvg and\nFedProx, and the first to characterize the gains in joining FL.

In addition to\nproviding full access to the data, code, and methodology, Strumia (2020)\nsystematically describes and accounts for gender differences in HEP citation\nnetworks. His analysis points both to ongoing difficulties in attracting women\nto high-energy physics and an encouraging-though slow-trend in improvement.\nUnfortunately, however, the time and effort Strumia (2020) devoted to collating\nand quantifying the data are not matched by a similar rigour in interpreting\nthe results. To support his conclusions, he selectively cites available\nliterature and fails to adequately adjust for a range of confounding factors.\nFor example, his analyses do not consider how unobserved factors - e.g., a\ntendency to overcite well-known authors-drive a wedge between quality and\ncitations and correlate with author gender. He also fails to take into account\nmany structural and non-structural factors - including, but not limited to,\ndirect discrimination and the expectations women form (and actions they take)\nin response to it-that undoubtedly lead to gender differences in productivity.\nWe therefore believe that a number of Strumia's conclusions are not supported\nby his analysis. Indeed, we re-analyse a subsample of solo-authored papers from\nhis data, adjusting for year and journal of publication, authors' research age\nand their lifetime \"fame\". Our re-analysis suggests that female-authored papers\nare actually cited more than male-authored papers.

    "title": "Frequency Reflection Modulation for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface  Aided OFDM Systems",
    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) based reflection modulation has been\nconsidered as a promising information delivery mechanism, and has the potential\nto realize passive information transfer of a RIS without consuming any\nadditional radio frequency chain and time/frequency/energy resources. The\nexisting on-off reflection modulation (ORM) schemes are based on manipulating\nthe ``on/off'' states of RIS elements, which may lead to the degradation of RIS\nreflection efficiency. This paper proposes a frequency reflection modulation\n(FRM) method for RIS-aided OFDM systems. The FRM-OFDM scheme modulates the\nfrequency of the incident electromagnetic waves, and the RIS information is\nembedded in the frequency-hoping states of RIS elements. Unlike the ORM-OFDM\nscheme, the FRM-OFDM scheme can achieve higher reflection efficiency, since the\nlatter does not turn off any reflection element in reflection modulation. We\npropose a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to maximize the user\nachievable rate for the FRM-OFDM system by jointly optimizing the phase shift\nof the RIS and the power allocation at the transmitter. Further, we design a\nbilinear message passing (BMP) algorithm for the bilinear recovery of both the\nuser symbols and the RIS data. Numerical simulations have verified the\nefficiency of the designed BCD algorithm for system optimization and the BMP\nalgorithm for signal detection, as well as the superiority of the proposed\nFRM-OFDM scheme over the ORM-OFDM scheme.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a flurry of research on the use of Reconfigurable\nIntelligent Surfaces (RIS) in wireless networks to create dynamic radio\nenvironments. In this paper, we investigate the use of an RIS panel to improve\nbi-directional communications. Assuming that the RIS will be located on the\nfacade of a building, we propose to connect it to a solar panel that harvests\nenergy to be used to power the RIS panel's smart controller and reflecting\nelements. Therefore, we present a novel framework to optimally decide the\ntransmit power of each user and the number of elements that will be used to\nreflect the signal of any two communicating pair in the system (user-user or\nbase station-user). An optimization problem is formulated to jointly minimize a\nscalarized function of the energy of the communicating pair and the RIS panel\nand to find the optimal number of reflecting elements used by each user.\nAlthough the formulated problem is a mixed-integer non-linear problem, the\noptimal solution is found by linearizing the non-linear constraints. Besides, a\nmore efficient close to the optimal solution is found using Bender\ndecomposition. Simulation results show that the proposed model is capable of\ndelivering the minimum rate of each user even if line-of-sight communication is\nnot achievable.",

Second,\nwe analyzed the most comprehensive US fatal police shooting dataset from\nWashington Post. We used FP-growth to reveal the frequent patterns and DBSCAN\nclustering to find fatal shooting hotspots. We brought multi-attributes (social\neconomics, demographics, political tendency, education, gun ownership rate,\npolice training hours, etc.) to reveal connections under the iceberg. We found\nthat the police shooting rate of a state depends on many variables. The top\nfour most relevant attributes were state joined year, state land area, gun\nownership rate, and violent crime rate. Third, we proposed four regression\nmodels to predict police shooting rates at the state level. The best model\nKstar could predict the fatal police shooting rate with about 88.53%\ncorrelation coefficient. We also proposed classification models, including\nGradient Boosting Machine, Multi-class Classifier, Logistic Regression, and\nNaive Bayes Classifier, to predict the race of fatal police shooting victims.\nOur classification models show no significant evidence to conclude that racial\ndiscrimination happened during fatal police shootings recorded by the WP\ndataset.",

We first show that when using i.i.d.\nGaussian measurements and an $L$-Lipschitz continuous generative model with\nbounded $k$-dimensional inputs, roughly $O(k \\log L)$ samples suffice to\nguarantee that the signal is close to any vector that minimizes an\namplitude-based empirical loss function. Attaining this sample complexity with\na practical algorithm remains a difficult challenge, and a popular spectral\ninitialization method has been observed to pose a major bottleneck. To\npartially address this, we further show that roughly $O(k \\log L)$ samples\nensure sufficient closeness between the signal and any {\\em globally optimal}\nsolution to an optimization problem designed for spectral initialization\n(though finding such a solution may still be challenging). We adapt this result\nto sparse phase retrieval, and show that $O(s \\log n)$ samples are sufficient\nfor a similar guarantee when the underlying signal is $s$-sparse and\n$n$-dimensional, matching an information-theoretic lower bound. While our\nguarantees do not directly correspond to a practical algorithm, we propose a\npractical spectral initialization method motivated by our findings, and\nexperimentally observe significant performance gains over various existing\nspectral initialization methods of sparse phase retrieval.",

Moreover, dependencies of various\norders co-exist in the datasets. In the Undirected probabilistic Graphical\nModel (UGM) framework the Glasso algorithm has been proposed to deal with high\ndimensional micro-array datasets forcing sparsity. Also, modifications of the\ndefault Glasso algorithm are developed to overcome the problem of complex\ninteraction structure. In this work we advocate the use of a simple score-based\nHill Climbing algorithm (HC) that learns Gaussian Bayesian Networks (BNs)\nleaning on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). We compare HC with Glasso and its\nmodifications in the UGM framework on their capability to reconstruct GRNs from\nmicro-array data belonging to the Escherichia Coli genome. We benefit from the\nanalytical properties of the Joint Probability Density (JPD) function on which\nboth directed and undirected PGMs build to convert DAGs to UGMs.\nWe conclude that dependencies in complex data are learned best by the HC\nalgorithm, presenting them most accurately and efficiently, simultaneously\nmodelling strong local and weaker but significant global connections coexisting\nin the gene expression dataset. The HC algorithm adapts intrinsically to the\ncomplex dependency structure of the dataset, without forcing a specific\nstructure in advance.

Nevertheless, alternative dynamics have been\nintroduced using ad-hoc auxiliary objects, such as that resulting from binary\nprojections of Memory Boolean networks, or that resulting from additional\npseudo-states for Most Permissive Boolean networks.

Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential to re-construct\nthe high-resolution (HR) thin-slice MR images from those low-resolution (LR)\ncases, which we refer to as the slice interpolation task in this work. However,\nsince it is generally difficult to sample abundant paired LR-HR MR images, the\nclassical fully supervised DL-based models cannot be effectively trained to get\nrobust performance.

The paired LR-HR images are synthesized along the sagittal\nand coronal directions of input LR images for network pretraining in the\nfirst-stage SSL, and then a cyclic in-terpolation procedure based on triplet\naxial slices is designed in the second-stage SSL for further refinement. More\ntraining samples with rich contexts along all directions are exploited as\nguidance to guarantee the improved in-terpolation performance. Moreover, a new\ncycle-consistency constraint is proposed to supervise this cyclic procedure,\nwhich encourages the network to reconstruct more realistic HR images.

Theory and Methods: The predictable\ncomponents sampled across the echo dimension in a multi-echo GRE sequence are\nrecovered by rank minimizing a Hankel matrix formed using the complex\nexponential of the background suppressed phase. To estimate the single\nfrequency component that relates to the susceptibility induced field, it is\nrequired to maintain consistency with the measured phase after background\nsuppression, penalized by a unity rank approximation (URA) prior. This is\nformulated as an optimization problem, implemented using the alternating\ndirection method of multiplier (ADMM). Results: With in vivo multi-echo GRE\ndata, the magnitude susceptibility weighted image (SWI) reconstructed using URA\nprior shows additional venous structures that are obscured due to phase\ndispersion and noise in regions subject to remnant non-local field variations.\nThe performance is compared with the susceptibility map weighted imaging (SMWI)\nand the standard SWI. It is also shown using numerical simulation that\nquantitative susceptibility map (QSM) computed from the reconstructed phase\nexhibits reduced artifacts and quantification error. In vivo experiments reveal\niron depositions in insular, motor cortex and superior frontal gyrus that are\nnot identified in standard QSM.

This results in substantial recurring calibration\noverheads even on current systems which use only a few gate types.

We develop NuOp, a flexible\ncompilation pass based on numerical optimization, to efficiently decompose\napplication operations into arbitrary hardware gate types. Using NuOp and four\nimportant quantum applications, we study the instruction set proposals of\nRigetti and Google, with realistic noise simulations and a calibration model.\nOur experiments show that implementing 4-8 types of 2Q gates is sufficient to\nattain nearly the same expressivity as a full continuous gate family, while\nreducing the calibration overhead by two orders of magnitude. With several\nvendors proposing rich gate families as means to higher fidelity, our work has\npotential to provide valuable instruction set design guidance for near-term QC\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "We approach the question, \"What is Consciousness?\" in a new way, not as\nDescartes' \"systematic doubt\", but as how organisms find their way in their\nworld. Finding one's way involves finding possible uses of features of the\nworld that might be beneficial or avoiding those that might be harmful.\n\"Possible uses of X to accomplish Y\" are \"Affordances\". The number of uses of X\nis indefinite, the different uses are unordered and are not deducible from one\nanother. All biological adaptations are either affordances seized by heritable\nvariation and selection or, far faster, by the organism acting in its world\nfinding uses of X to accomplish Y. Based on this, we reach rather astonishing\nconclusions: 1) Strong AI is not possible. Universal Turing Machines cannot\n\"find\" novel affordances. 2) Brain-mind is not purely classical physics for no\nclassical physics system can be an analogue computer whose dynamical behavior\ncan be isomorphic to \"possible uses\". 3) Brain mind must be partly quantum --\nsupported by increasing evidence at 6.0 sigma to 7.3 Sigma. 4) Based on\nHeisenberg's interpretation of the quantum state as \"Potentia\" converted to\n\"Actuals\" by Measurement, a natural hypothesis is that mind actualizes\nPotentia. This is supported at 5.2 Sigma. Then Mind's actualization of\nentangled brain-mind-world states are experienced as qualia and allow \"seeing\"\nor \"perceiving\" of uses of X to accomplish Y. We can and do jury-rig. Computers\ncannot. 5) Beyond familiar quantum computers, we consider Trans-Turing-Systems.",

    "title": "Model-Centric Volumetric Point Cloud Attributes",
    "abstract": "Point clouds have recently gained interest, especially for real-time\napplications and for 3D-scanned material, such as is used in autonomous\ndriving, architecture, and engineering, to model real estate for renovation or\ndisplay. Point clouds are associated with geometry information and attributes\nsuch as color. Be the color unique or direction-dependent (in the case of\nplenoptic point clouds), it reflects the colors observed by cameras displaced\naround the object. Hence, not only are the viewing references assumed, but the\nillumination spectrum and illumination geometry is also implicit. We propose a\nmodel-centric description of the 3D object, that is independent of the\nillumination and of the position of the cameras. We want to be able to describe\nthe objects themselves such that, at a later stage, the rendering of the model\nmay decide where to place illumination, from which it may calculate the image\nviewed by a given camera. We want to be able to describe transparent or\ntranslucid objects, mirrors, fishbowls, fog and smoke. Volumetric clouds may\nallow us to describe the air, however ``empty'', and introduce air particles,\nin a manner independent of the viewer position. For that, we rely on some\neletromagnetic properties to arrive at seven attributes per voxel that would\ndescribe the material and its color or transparency. Three attributes are for\nthe transmissivity of each color, three are for the attenuation of each color,\nand another attribute is for diffuseness. These attributes give information\nabout the object to the renderer, with whom lies the decision on how to render\nand depict each object.",

    "abstract": "Physically consistent coupling conditions at the fluid-porous interface with\ncorrectly determined effective parameters are necessary for accurate\nmathematical modeling of various applications described by coupled free-flow\nand porous-medium problems. To model single-fluid-phase flows at low Reynolds\nnumbers in such coupled systems, the Stokes/Darcy equations are typically used\ntogether with the conservation of mass across the fluid-porous interface, the\nbalance of normal forces and the Beavers-Joseph condition on the tangential\ncomponent of velocity. In the latter condition, the value of the Beavers-Joseph\nslip coefficient is uncertain, however, it is routinely set equal to one that\nis not correct for many applications. In this paper, three flow problems\n(pressure-driven flow, lid-driven cavity over porous bed, general filtration\nproblem) with different pore geometries are studied. We determine the optimal\nvalue of the Beavers-Joseph parameter for unidirectional flows minimizing the\nerror between the pore-scale resolved and macroscale simulation results. We\ndemonstrate that the Beavers-Joseph slip coefficient is not constant along the\nfluid-porous interface for arbitrary flow directions, thus, the Beavers-Joseph\ncondition is not applicable in this case.",

While high-quality image\nacquisition is typically expensive and time-consuming, medium-quality images\nare faster to acquire, at lower equipment costs, and available in larger\nquantities. Thus, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) that\ncan leverage training data at multiple levels of quality (e.g., high and medium\nquality) to improve performance while limiting costs of data curation. We apply\nour mixed-supervision GAN to (i) super-resolve histopathology images and (ii)\nenhance laparoscopy images by combining super-resolution and surgical smoke\nremoval.

    "abstract": "Tensor product operators on finite dimensional Hilbert spaces are studied.\nThe focus is on bilinear tensor product operators. A tensor product operator on\na pair of Hilbert spaces is a maximally general bilinear operator into a target\nHilbert space. By 'maximally general' is meant every bilinear operator from the\nsame pair of spaces to any Hilbert space factors into the composition of the\ntensor product operator with a uniquely determined linear mapping on the target\nspace. There are multiple distinct tensor product operators of the same type;\nthere is no \"the\" tensor product. Distinctly different tensor product operators\ncan be associated with different parts of a multipartite system without\ndifficulty. Separability of states, and locality of operators and observables\nis tensor product operator dependent. The same state in the target state space\ncan be inseparable with respect to one tensor product operator but separable\nwith respect to another, and no tensor product operator is distinguished\nrelative to the others; the unitary operator used to construct a Bell state\nfrom a pair of |0>'s being highly tensor product operator-dependent is a prime\nexample. The relationship between two tensor product operators of the same type\nis given by composition with a unitary operator. There is an equivalence\nbetween change of tensor product operator and change of basis in the target\nspace. Among the gains from change of tensor product operator is the\nlocalization of some nonlocal operators as well as separability of inseparable\nstates. Examples are given.",
