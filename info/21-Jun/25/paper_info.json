    "abstract": "Recent advances in differentially private deep learning have demonstrated\nthat application of differential privacy, specifically the DP-SGD algorithm,\nhas a disparate impact on different sub-groups in the population, which leads\nto a significantly high drop-in model utility for sub-populations that are\nunder-represented (minorities), compared to well-represented ones. In this\nwork, we aim to compare PATE, another mechanism for training deep learning\nmodels using differential privacy, with DP-SGD in terms of fairness. We show\nthat PATE does have a disparate impact too, however, it is much less severe\nthan DP-SGD. We draw insights from this observation on what might be promising\ndirections in achieving better fairness-privacy trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "Deep Learning as a field has been successfully used to solve a plethora of\ncomplex problems, the likes of which we could not have imagined a few decades\nback. But as many benefits as it brings, there are still ways in which it can\nbe used to bring harm to our society. Deep fakes have been proven to be one\nsuch problem, and now more than ever, when any individual can create a fake\nimage or video simply using an application on the smartphone, there need to be\nsome countermeasures, with which we can detect if the image or video is a fake\nor real and dispose of the problem threatening the trustworthiness of online\ninformation. Although the Deep fakes created by neural networks, may seem to be\nas real as a real image or video, it still leaves behind spatial and temporal\ntraces or signatures after moderation, these signatures while being invisible\nto a human eye can be detected with the help of a neural network trained to\nspecialize in Deep fake detection. In this paper, we analyze several such\nstates of the art neural networks (MesoNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, and Xception\nNet) and compare them against each other, to find an optimal solution for\nvarious scenarios like real-time deep fake detection to be deployed in online\nsocial media platforms where the classification should be made as fast as\npossible or for a small news agency where the classification need not be in\nreal-time but requires utmost accuracy.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes FBK's system submission to the IWSLT 2021 Offline Speech\nTranslation task. We participated with a direct model, which is a\nTransformer-based architecture trained to translate English speech audio data\ninto German texts. The training pipeline is characterized by knowledge\ndistillation and a two-step fine-tuning procedure. Both knowledge distillation\nand the first fine-tuning step are carried out on manually segmented real and\nsynthetic data, the latter being generated with an MT system trained on the\navailable corpora. Differently, the second fine-tuning step is carried out on a\nrandom segmentation of the MuST-C v2 En-De dataset. Its main goal is to reduce\nthe performance drops occurring when a speech translation model trained on\nmanually segmented data (i.e. an ideal, sentence-like segmentation) is\nevaluated on automatically segmented audio (i.e. actual, more realistic testing\nconditions). For the same purpose, a custom hybrid segmentation procedure that\naccounts for both audio content (pauses) and for the length of the produced\nsegments is applied to the test data before passing them to the system. At\ninference time, we compared this procedure with a baseline segmentation method\nbased on Voice Activity Detection (VAD). Our results indicate the effectiveness\nof the proposed hybrid approach, shown by a reduction of the gap with manual\nsegmentation from 8.3 to 1.4 BLEU points.",

CNER facilitates the study of side-effect on medications including\nidentification of novel phenomena and human-focused information extraction.\nExisting approaches in extracting the entities of interests focus on using\nstatic word embeddings to represent each word. However, one word can have\ndifferent interpretations that depend on the context of the sentences.\nEvidently, static word embeddings are insufficient to integrate the diverse\ninterpretation of a word. To overcome this challenge, the technique of\ncontextualized word embedding has been introduced to better capture the\nsemantic meaning of each word based on its context. Two of these language\nmodels, ELMo and Flair, have been widely used in the field of Natural Language\nProcessing to generate the contextualized word embeddings on domain-generic\ndocuments. However, these embeddings are usually too general to capture the\nproximity among vocabularies of specific domains. To facilitate various\ndownstream applications using clinical case reports (CCRs), we pre-train two\ndeep contextualized language models, Clinical Embeddings from Language Model\n(C-ELMo) and Clinical Contextual String Embeddings (C-Flair) using the\nclinical-related corpus from the PubMed Central.

For networks of constant depth and with a\nlarge range of widths (for instance, it suffices if the width of each layer is\npolynomial in that of any other layer), small perturbations of input vectors\nlead to large changes of outputs. This generalizes results of Daniely and\nSchacham (2020) for networks of rapidly decreasing width and of Bubeck et al\n(2021) for two-layer networks. The proof shows that adversarial examples arise\nin these networks because the functions that they compute are very close to\nlinear. Bottleneck layers in the network play a key role: the minimal width up\nto some point in the network determines scales and sensitivities of mappings\ncomputed up to that point. The main result is for networks with constant depth,\nbut we also show that some constraint on depth is necessary for a result of\nthis kind, because there are suitably deep networks that, with constant\nprobability, compute a function that is close to constant.",

It is known that NNs have a specific\nscale transformation that constitutes equivalent classes where functional\nproperties are completely identical, and at the same time, their sharpness\ncould change unlimitedly. We define our sharpness through a minimization\nproblem over the equivalent NNs being invariant to the scale transformation. We\nalso develop an efficient and exact technique to make the sharpness tractable,\nwhich reduces the heavy computational costs involved with Hessian.

    "abstract": "The self-attention-based model, transformer, is recently becoming the leading\nbackbone in the field of computer vision. In spite of the impressive success\nmade by transformers in a variety of vision tasks, it still suffers from heavy\ncomputation and intensive memory cost. To address this limitation, this paper\npresents an Interpretability-Aware REDundancy REDuction framework (IA-RED$^2$).\nWe start by observing a large amount of redundant computation, mainly spent on\nuncorrelated input patches, and then introduce an interpretable module to\ndynamically and gracefully drop these redundant patches. This novel framework\nis then extended to a hierarchical structure, where uncorrelated tokens at\ndifferent stages are gradually removed, resulting in a considerable shrinkage\nof computational cost. We include extensive experiments on both image and video\ntasks, where our method could deliver up to 1.4X speed-up for state-of-the-art\nmodels like DeiT and TimeSformer, by only sacrificing less than 0.7% accuracy.\nMore importantly, contrary to other acceleration approaches, our method is\ninherently interpretable with substantial visual evidence, making vision\ntransformer closer to a more human-understandable architecture while being\nlighter. We demonstrate that the interpretability that naturally emerged in our\nframework can outperform the raw attention learned by the original visual\ntransformer, as well as those generated by off-the-shelf interpretation\nmethods, with both qualitative and quantitative results.

Indeed, learning to rank via\ncombining representations is both principled and practical for learning a\nranking function for a particular query. In extremely data-scarce settings,\nhowever, the amount of labeled data available for a particular query can lead\nto a highly variable and ineffective ranking function. One way to mitigate the\neffect of the small amount of data is to leverage information from semantically\nsimilar queries. Indeed, as we demonstrate in simulation settings and real data\nexamples, when semantically similar queries are available it is possible to\ngainfully use them when ranking with respect to a particular query.

As these applications need to run 'forever'\nand cope with large, spiky data loads, they further require to be run in a\ndistributed setting. We are unaware of any streaming system that provides all\nthose properties. Instead, existing systems take large simplifications, such as\nimplementing sliding windows as a fixed set of overlapping windows,\njeopardizing metric accuracy (violating regulatory rules) or latency (breaching\nservice agreements).

We\nbenchmarked an initial prototype of Railgun using real data, showing\nsignificant lower latency than Flink and low memory usage independent of window\nsize. Further, we show that Railgun scales nearly linearly, respecting our\nmsec-level latencies at high percentiles (<250ms @ 99.9%) even under a load of\n1 million events per second.",

We then annotated the dialogue acts in the corpus along four\ndimensions: illocutionary intent, API information type(s), backward-facing\nfunction, and traceability to specific API components. We observed a diverse\nrange of interactions that will facilitate the development of dialogue\nstrategies for virtual assistants for API usage.",

    "abstract": "It is increasingly common to model, simulate, and process complex materials\nbased on loopy structures, such as in yarn-level cloth garments, which possess\ntopological constraints between inter-looping curves. While the input model may\nsatisfy specific topological linkages between pairs of closed loops, subsequent\nprocessing may violate those topological conditions. In this paper, we explore\na family of methods for efficiently computing and verifying linking numbers\nbetween closed curves, and apply these to applications in geometry processing,\nanimation, and simulation, so as to verify that topological invariants are\npreserved during and after processing of the input models. Our method has three\nstages: (1) we identify potentially interacting loop-loop pairs, then (2)\ncarefully discretize each loop's spline curves into line segments so as to\nenable (3) efficient linking number evaluation using accelerated kernels based\non either counting projected segment-segment crossings, or by evaluating the\nGauss linking integral using direct or fast summation methods (Barnes-Hut or\nfast multipole methods). We evaluate CPU and GPU implementations of these\nmethods on a suite of test problems, including yarn-level cloth and chainmail,\nthat involve significant processing: physics-based relaxation and animation,\nuser-modeled deformations, curve compression and reparameterization. We show\nthat topology errors can be efficiently identified to enable more robust\nprocessing of loopy structures.",

    "title": "Extreme Multi-label Learning for Semantic Matching in Product Search",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of semantic matching in product search: given a\ncustomer query, retrieve all semantically related products from a huge catalog\nof size 100 million, or more. Because of large catalog spaces and real-time\nlatency constraints, semantic matching algorithms not only desire high recall\nbut also need to have low latency. Conventional lexical matching approaches\n(e.g., Okapi-BM25) exploit inverted indices to achieve fast inference time, but\nfail to capture behavioral signals between queries and products. In contrast,\nembedding-based models learn semantic representations from customer behavior\ndata, but the performance is often limited by shallow neural encoders due to\nlatency constraints. Semantic product search can be viewed as an eXtreme\nMulti-label Classification (XMC) problem, where customer queries are input\ninstances and products are output labels. In this paper, we aim to improve\nsemantic product search by using tree-based XMC models where inference time\ncomplexity is logarithmic in the number of products. We consider hierarchical\nlinear models with n-gram features for fast real-time inference.\nQuantitatively, our method maintains a low latency of 1.25 milliseconds per\nquery and achieves a 65% improvement of Recall@100 (60.9% v.s. 36.8%) over a\ncompeting embedding-based DSSM model. Our model is robust to weight pruning\nwith varying thresholds, which can flexibly meet different system requirements\nfor online deployments. Qualitatively, our method can retrieve products that\nare complementary to existing product search system and add diversity to the\nmatch set.",

The world is highly dynamic, and\nbehavioural agents must generalize across a variety of environments and\nobjectives over time. This scenario can be modeled as a partially-observable\nmulti-task reinforcement learning problem. We use genetic programming to evolve\nhighly-generalized agents capable of operating in six unique environments from\nthe control literature, including OpenAI's entire Classic Control suite. This\nrequires the agent to support discrete and continuous actions simultaneously.\nNo task-identification sensor inputs are provided, thus agents must identify\ntasks from the dynamics of state variables alone and define control policies\nfor each task. We show that emergent hierarchical structure in the evolving\nprograms leads to multi-task agents that succeed by performing a temporal\ndecomposition and encoding of the problem environments in memory.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel and robust algorithm is proposed for adaptive\nbeamforming based on the idea of reconstructing the autocorrelation sequence\n(ACS) of a random process from a set of measured data. This is obtained from\nthe first column and the first row of the sample covariance matrix (SCM) after\naveraging along its diagonals. Then, the power spectrum of the correlation\nsequence is estimated using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The DFT\ncoefficients corresponding to the angles within the noise-plus-interference\nregion are used to reconstruct the noise-plus-interference covariance matrix\n(NPICM), while the desired signal covariance matrix (DSCM) is estimated by\nidentifying and removing the noise-plus-interference component from the SCM. In\nparticular, the spatial power spectrum of the estimated received signal is\nutilized to compute the correlation sequence corresponding to the\nnoise-plus-interference in which the dominant DFT coefficient of the\nnoise-plus-interference is captured. A key advantage of the proposed adaptive\nbeamforming is that only little prior information is required. Specifically, an\nimprecise knowledge of the array geometry and of the angular sectors in which\nthe interferences are located is needed. Simulation results demonstrate that\ncompared with previous reconstruction-based beamformers, the proposed approach\ncan achieve better overall performance in the case of multiple mismatches over\na very large range of input signal-to-noise ratios.",

Due to\nlimited availability of resources a substantial part of people at risk can not\nreceive necessary monitoring and thus are exposed to excessive danger.\nNowadays, this problem is usually solved via applying Human Activity\nRecognition (HAR) methods. HAR is a perspective and fast-paced Data Science\nfield, which has a wide range of application areas such as healthcare, sport,\nsecurity etc. However, the currently techniques of recognition are markedly\nlacking in accuracy, hence, the present paper suggests a highly accurate method\nfor human activity classification. Wepropose a new workflow to address the HAR\nproblem and evaluate it on the UniMiB SHAR dataset, which consists of the\naccelerometer signals. The model we suggest is based on continuous wavelet\ntransform (CWT) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Wavelet transform\nlocalizes signal features both in time and frequency domains and after that a\nCNN extracts these features and recognizes activity. It is also worth noting\nthat CWT converts 1D accelerometer signal into 2D images and thus enables to\nobtain better results as 2D networks have a significantly higher predictive\ncapacity. In the course of the work we build a convolutional neural network and\nvary such model parameters as number of spatial axes, number of layers, number\nof neurons in each layer, image size, type of mother wavelet, the order of zero\nmoment of mother wavelet etc. Besides, we also apply models with residual\nblocks which resulted in significantly higher metric values.

The\nproposed scheme automatically determines relevant neural connections and adapts\naccordingly, in contrast to the classical LSTM solution. Due to its\nflexibility, the new LSTM scheme is less prone to overfitting, and hence can\napproximate time dependent solutions by use of a smaller data set.

    "abstract": "When reasoning about strategic behavior in a machine learning context it is\ntempting to combine standard microfoundations of rational agents with the\nstatistical decision theory underlying classification. In this work, we argue\nthat a direct combination of these standard ingredients leads to brittle\nsolution concepts of limited descriptive and prescriptive value. First, we show\nthat rational agents with perfect information produce discontinuities in the\naggregate response to a decision rule that we often do not observe empirically.\nSecond, when any positive fraction of agents is not perfectly strategic,\ndesirable stable points -- where the classifier is optimal for the data it\nentails -- cease to exist. Third, optimal decision rules under standard\nmicrofoundations maximize a measure of negative externality known as social\nburden within a broad class of possible assumptions about agent behavior.\nRecognizing these limitations we explore alternatives to standard\nmicrofoundations for binary classification. We start by describing a set of\ndesiderata that help navigate the space of possible assumptions about how\nagents respond to a decision rule. In particular, we analyze a natural\nconstraint on feature manipulations, and discuss properties that are sufficient\nto guarantee the robust existence of stable points. Building on these insights,\nwe then propose the noisy response model. Inspired by smoothed analysis and\nempirical observations, noisy response incorporates imperfection in the agent\nresponses, which we show mitigates the limitations of standard\nmicrofoundations. Our model retains analytical tractability, leads to more\nrobust insights about stable points, and imposes a lower social burden at\noptimality.",

This has\nelevated the need for improved designs by embodying countermeasures, with\nmasking being the most prominent example. To formally verify the security of a\nmasking scheme, numerous attack models have been developed to capture the\nphysical properties of the information leakage as well as the capabilities of\nthe adversary. With regard to these models, extensive research has been\nperformed to realize masking schemes. These research efforts have led to\nsignificant progress in the development of security assessment methodologies\nand further initiated standardization activities. However, since the majority\nof this work is theoretical, it is challenging for the more practice-oriented\nhardware security community to fully grasp and contribute to. To bridge the\ngap, these advancements are reviewed and discussed in this survey, mainly from\nthe perspective of hardware security. In doing so, a clear taxonomy is provided\nthat is helpful for a systematic treatment of the masking-related topics. By\ngiving an extensive overview of the existing methods, this survey (1) provides\na research landscape of circuit masking for newcomers to the field, (2) offers\nguidelines on which attack model and verification tool to choose when designing\nmasking schemes, and (3) identifies interesting new research directions where\nmasking models and assessment tools can be applied.

    "abstract": "Arbitrary-shaped text detection is a challenging task since curved texts in\nthe wild are of the complex geometric layouts. Existing mainstream methods\nfollow the instance segmentation pipeline to obtain the text regions. However,\narbitraryshaped texts are difficult to be depicted through one single\nsegmentation network because of the varying scales. In this paper, we propose a\ntwo-stage segmentation-based detector, termed as NASK (Need A Second looK), for\narbitrary-shaped text detection. Compared to the traditional single-stage\nsegmentation network, our NASK conducts the detection in a coarse-to-fine\nmanner with the first stage segmentation spotting the rectangle text proposals\nand the second one retrieving compact representations. Specifically, NASK is\ncomposed of a Text Instance Segmentation (TIS) network (1st stage), a\nGeometry-aware Text RoI Alignment (GeoAlign) module, and a Fiducial pOint\neXpression (FOX) module (2nd stage). Firstly, TIS extracts the augmented\nfeatures with a novel Group Spatial and Channel Attention (GSCA) module and\nconducts instance segmentation to obtain rectangle proposals. Then, GeoAlign\nconverts these rectangles into the fixed size and encodes RoI-wise feature\nrepresentation. Finally, FOX disintegrates the text instance into serval\npivotal geometrical attributes to refine the detection results. Extensive\nexperimental results on three public benchmarks including Total-Text,\nSCUTCTW1500, and ICDAR 2015 verify that our NASK outperforms recent\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

The suffix array of a\nlength-$n$ text uses $\\Theta(n \\log n)$ bits, which is prohibitive in many\napplications. To address this, Grossi and Vitter [STOC 2000] and,\nindependently, Ferragina and Manzini [FOCS 2000] introduced space-efficient\nversions of the suffix array, known as the compressed suffix array (CSA) and\nthe FM-index. For a length-$n$ text over an alphabet of size $\\sigma$, these\ndata structures use only $O(n \\log \\sigma)$ bits. Immediately after their\ndiscovery, they almost completely replaced plain suffix arrays in practical\napplications, and a race started to develop efficient construction procedures.\nYet, after more than 20 years, even for $\\sigma=2$, the fastest algorithm\nremains stuck at $O(n)$ time [Hon et al., FOCS 2003], which is slower by a\n$\\Theta(\\log n)$ factor than the lower bound of $\\Omega(n / \\log n)$ (following\nsimply from the necessity to read the entire input). We break this\nlong-standing barrier with a new data structure that takes $O(n \\log \\sigma)$\nbits, answers suffix array queries in $O(\\log^{\\epsilon} n)$ time, and can be\nconstructed in $O(n\\log \\sigma / \\sqrt{\\log n})$ time using $O(n\\log \\sigma)$\nbits of space. Our result is based on several new insights into the recently\ndeveloped notion of string synchronizing sets [STOC 2019]. In particular,\ncompared to their previous applications, we eliminate orthogonal range queries,\nreplacing them with new queries that we dub prefix rank and prefix selection\nqueries. As a further demonstration of our techniques, we present a new\npattern-matching index that simultaneously minimizes the construction time and\nthe query time among all known compact indexes (i.e., those using $O(n \\log\n\\sigma)$ bits).",

In this survey, we first introduce\nthe background of popular sensors for autonomous cars, including their common\ndata representations as well as object detection networks developed for each\ntype of sensor data. Next, we discuss some popular datasets for multi-modal 3D\nobject detection, with a special focus on the sensor data included in each\ndataset. Then we present in-depth reviews of recent multi-modal 3D detection\nnetworks by considering the following three aspects of the fusion: fusion\nlocation, fusion data representation, and fusion granularity. After a detailed\nreview, we discuss open challenges and point out possible solutions. We hope\nthat our detailed review can help researchers to embark investigations in the\narea of multi-modal 3D object detection.",

    "abstract": "The conventional spatial convolution layers in the Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) are computationally expensive at the point where the training\ntime could take days unless the number of layers, the number of training images\nor the size of the training images are reduced. The image size of 256x256\npixels is commonly used for most of the applications of CNN, but this image\nsize is too small for applications like Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)\nclassification where the image details are important for accurate\nclassification. This research proposed Frequency Domain Convolution (FDC) and\nFrequency Domain Pooling (FDP) layers which were built with RFFT, kernel\ninitialization strategy, convolution artifact removal and Channel Independent\nConvolution (CIC) to replace the conventional convolution and pooling layers.\nThe FDC and FDP layers are used to build a Frequency Domain Convolutional\nNeural Network (FDCNN) to accelerate the training of large images for DR\nclassification. The Full FDC layer is an extension of the FDC layer to allow\ndirect use in conventional CNNs, it is also used to modify the VGG16\narchitecture. FDCNN is shown to be at least 54.21% faster and 70.74% more\nmemory efficient compared to an equivalent CNN architecture. The modified VGG16\narchitecture with Full FDC layer is reported to achieve a shorter training time\nand a higher accuracy at 95.63% compared to the original VGG16 architecture for\nDR classification.",

    "abstract": "The autonomous real-time optical navigation of planetary UAV is of the key\ntechnologies to ensure the success of the exploration. In such a GPS denied\nenvironment, vision-based localization is an optimal approach. In this paper,\nwe proposed a multi-modal registration based SLAM algorithm, which estimates\nthe location of a planet UAV using a nadir view camera on the UAV compared with\npre-existing digital terrain model. To overcome the scale and appearance\ndifference between on-board UAV images and pre-installed digital terrain model,\na theoretical model is proposed to prove that topographic features of UAV image\nand DEM can be correlated in frequency domain via cross power spectrum. To\nprovide the six-DOF of the UAV, we also developed an optimization approach\nwhich fuses the geo-referencing result into a SLAM system via LBA (Local Bundle\nAdjustment) to achieve robust and accurate vision-based navigation even in\nfeatureless planetary areas. To test the robustness and effectiveness of the\nproposed localization algorithm, a new cross-source drone-based localization\ndataset for planetary exploration is proposed. The proposed dataset includes\n40200 synthetic drone images taken from nine planetary scenes with related DEM\nquery images. Comparison experiments carried out demonstrate that over the\nflight distance of 33.8km, the proposed method achieved average localization\nerror of 0.45 meters, compared to 1.31 meters by ORB-SLAM, with the processing\nspeed of 12hz which will ensure a real-time performance. We will make our\ndatasets available to encourage further work on this promising topic.",

    "abstract": "Containerization is a lightweight application virtualization technology,\nproviding high environmental consistency, operating system distribution\nportability, and resource isolation. Existing mainstream cloud service\nproviders have prevalently adopted container technologies in their distributed\nsystem infrastructures for automated application management. To handle the\nautomation of deployment, maintenance, autoscaling, and networking of\ncontainerized applications, container orchestration is proposed as an essential\nresearch problem.

Such insights could further improve the\nquality of resource provisioning decisions in response to the changing\nworkloads under complex environments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive\nliterature review of existing machine learning-based container orchestration\napproaches. Detailed taxonomies are proposed to classify the current researches\nby their common features. Moreover, the evolution of machine learning-based\ncontainer orchestration technologies from the year 2016 to 2021 has been\ndesigned based on objectives and metrics.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Leverage existing biomedical NLP tools and DS domain terminology\nto produce a novel and comprehensive knowledge graph containing dietary\nsupplement (DS) information for discovering interactions between DS and drugs,\nor Drug-Supplement Interactions (DSI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created\nSemRepDS (an extension of SemRep), capable of extracting semantic relations\nfrom abstracts by leveraging a DS-specific terminology (iDISK) containing\n28,884 DS terms not found in the UMLS. PubMed abstracts were processed using\nSemRepDS to generate semantic relations, which were then filtered using a\nPubMedBERT-based model to remove incorrect relations before generating our\nknowledge graph (SuppKG). Two pathways are used to identify potential DS-Drug\ninteractions which are then evaluated by medical professionals for mechanistic\nplausibility. RESULTS: Comparison analysis found that SemRepDS returned 206.9%\nmore DS relations and 158.5% more DS entities than SemRep. The fine-tuned BERT\nmodel obtained an F1 score of 0.8605 and removed 43.86% of the relations,\nimproving the precision of the relations by 26.4% compared to pre-filtering.\nSuppKG consists of 2,928 DS-specific nodes. Manual review of findings\nidentified 44 (88%) proposed DS-Gene-Drug and 32 (64%) proposed\nDS-Gene1-Function-Gene2-Drug pathways to be mechanistically plausible.\nDISCUSSION: The additional relations extracted using SemRepDS generated SuppKG\nthat was used to find plausible DSI not found in the current literature. By the\nnature of the SuppKG, these interactions are unlikely to have been found using\nSemRep without the expanded DS terminology. CONCLUSION: We successfully extend\nSemRep to include DS information and produce SuppKG which can be used to find\npotential DS-Drug interactions.",

    "abstract": "Background noise and room reverberation are regarded as two major factors to\ndegrade the subjective speech quality. In this paper, we propose an integrated\nframework to address simultaneous denoising and dereverberation under\ncomplicated scenario environments. It adopts a chain optimization strategy and\ndesigns four sub-stages accordingly. In the first two stages, we decouple the\nmulti-task learning w.r.t. complex spectrum into magnitude and phase, and only\nimplement noise and reverberation removal in the magnitude domain. Based on the\nestimated priors above, we further polish the spectrum in the third stage,\nwhere both magnitude and phase information are explicitly repaired with the\nresidual learning. Due to the data mismatch and nonlinear effect of DNNs, the\nresidual noise often exists in the DNN-processed spectrum. To resolve the\nproblem, we adopt a light-weight algorithm as the post-processing module to\ncapture and suppress the residual noise in the non-active regions.

    "abstract": "Service manual documents are crucial to the engineering company as they\nprovide guidelines and knowledge to service engineers. However, it has become\ninconvenient and inefficient for service engineers to retrieve specific\nknowledge from documents due to the complexity of resources. In this research,\nwe propose an automated knowledge mining and document classification system\nwith novel multi-model transfer learning approaches. Particularly, the\nclassification performance of the system has been improved with three effective\ntechniques: fine-tuning, pruning, and multi-model method. The fine-tuning\ntechnique optimizes a pre-trained BERT model by adding a feed-forward neural\nnetwork layer and the pruning technique is used to retrain the BERT model with\nnew data. The multi-model method initializes and trains multiple BERT models to\novercome the randomness of data ordering during the fine-tuning process. In the\nfirst iteration of the training process, multiple BERT models are being trained\nsimultaneously. The best model is then selected for the next phase of the\ntraining process with another two iterations and the training processes for\nother BERT models will be terminated. The performance of the proposed system\nhas been evaluated by comparing with two robust baseline methods, BERT and\nBERT-CNN. Experimental results on a widely used Corpus of Linguistic\nAcceptability (CoLA) dataset have shown that the proposed techniques perform\nbetter than these baseline methods in terms of accuracy and MCC score.",

However, it is still challenging\nto detect the initial intrusion on IoT devices prior to massive attacks. Recent\nstudies have utilized power side-channel information to characterize this\nintrusion behavior on IoT devices but still lack real-time detection\napproaches. This study aimed to design an online intrusion detection system\ncalled DeepAuditor for IoT devices via power auditing. To realize the real-time\nsystem, we first proposed a lightweight power auditing device called Power\nAuditor. With the Power Auditor, we developed a Distributed CNN classifier for\nonline inference in our laboratory setting. In order to protect data leakage\nand reduce networking redundancy, we also proposed a privacy-preserved\ninference protocol via Packed Homomorphic Encryption and a sliding window\nprotocol in our system. The classification accuracy and processing time were\nmeasured in our laboratory settings. We also demonstrated that the distributed\nCNN design is secure against any distributed components.

This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that\nstate-of-the-art models for NLP tasks are becoming deeper and more complex,\noften increasing the amount of training data required even for fine-tuning.\nWeak supervision methods, including data programming, address this problem and\nreduce the cost of label collection by using noisy label sources for\nsupervision.

To bridge this gap, the Data Programming by\nDemonstration framework was proposed to facilitate the automatic creation of\nlabeling functions based on a few examples labeled by a domain expert. This\nframework has proven successful for generating high-accuracy labeling models\nfor document classification. In this work, we extend the DPBD framework to\nspan-level annotation tasks, arguably one of the most time-consuming NLP\nlabeling tasks. We built a novel tool, TagRuler, that makes it easy for\nannotators to build span-level labeling functions without programming and\nencourages them to explore trade-offs between different labeling models and\nactive learning strategies.

However, the\nredundant information between distant frames has not been fully exploited in\nthese methods: corresponding patches of the same instance appear across distant\nframes at different scales. Based on this observation, we propose a video\nsuper-resolution method with long-term cross-scale aggregation that leverages\nsimilar patches (self-exemplars) across distant frames. Our model also consists\nof a multi-reference alignment module to fuse the features derived from similar\npatches: we fuse the features of distant references to perform high-quality\nsuper-resolution. We also propose a novel and practical training strategy for\nreferenced-based super-resolution. To evaluate the performance of our proposed\nmethod, we conduct extensive experiments on our collected CarCam dataset and\nthe Waymo Open dataset, and the results demonstrate our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods. Our source code will be publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Accurate models of robot dynamics are critical for safe and stable control\nand generalization to novel operational conditions. Hand-designed models,\nhowever, may be insufficiently accurate, even after careful parameter tuning.\nThis motivates the use of machine learning techniques to approximate the robot\ndynamics over a training set of state-control trajectories. The dynamics of\nmany robots, including ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles, are described\nin terms of their SE(3) pose and generalized velocity, and satisfy conservation\nof energy principles. This paper proposes a Hamiltonian formulation over the\nSE(3) manifold of the structure of a neural ordinary differential equation\n(ODE) network to approximate the dynamics of a rigid body. In contrast to a\nblack-box ODE network, our formulation guarantees total energy conservation by\nconstruction. We develop energy shaping and damping injection control for the\nlearned, potentially under-actuated SE(3) Hamiltonian dynamics to enable a\nunified approach for stabilization and trajectory tracking with various\nplatforms, including pendulum, rigid-body, and quadrotor systems.",

    "abstract": "We aim to solve the highly challenging task of generating continuous sign\nlanguage videos solely from speech segments for the first time. Recent efforts\nin this space have focused on generating such videos from human-annotated text\ntranscripts without considering other modalities. However, replacing speech\nwith sign language proves to be a practical solution while communicating with\npeople suffering from hearing loss. Therefore, we eliminate the need of using\ntext as input and design techniques that work for more natural, continuous,\nfreely uttered speech covering an extensive vocabulary. Since the current\ndatasets are inadequate for generating sign language directly from speech, we\ncollect and release the first Indian sign language dataset comprising\nspeech-level annotations, text transcripts, and the corresponding sign-language\nvideos. Next, we propose a multi-tasking transformer network trained to\ngenerate signer's poses from speech segments. With speech-to-text as an\nauxiliary task and an additional cross-modal discriminator, our model learns to\ngenerate continuous sign pose sequences in an end-to-end manner. Extensive\nexperiments and comparisons with other baselines demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach. We also conduct additional ablation studies to analyze the\neffect of different modules of our network. A demo video containing several\nresults is attached to the supplementary material.",

As (big) data\ncomplexity increases in the dimensions volume, variety, and velocity, this\nbecomes even more important. Many tools for cluster analysis have been\ndeveloped from early on and the variety of different clustering algorithms is\nhuge. As the selection of the right clustering procedure is crucial to the\nresults of the data analysis, users are in need for support on their journey of\nextracting knowledge from raw data. Thus, the objective of this paper lies in\nthe identification of a systematic selection logic for clustering algorithms\nand corresponding validation concepts. The goal is to enable potential users to\nchoose an algorithm that fits best to their needs and the properties of their\nunderlying data clustering problem. Moreover, users are supported in selecting\nthe right validation concepts to make sense of the clustering results. Based on\na comprehensive literature review, this paper provides assessment criteria for\nclustering method evaluation and validation concept selection. The criteria are\napplied to several common algorithms and the selection process of an algorithm\nis supported by the introduction of pseudocode-based routines that consider the\nunderlying data structure.",

Firstly, it is a\nnontrivial problem to identify bogus institutions selling education\ncredentials. While institutions are often accredited by qualified authorities\non a regional level, there is no global authority fulfilling this task.\nSecondly, many different data schemas are used to encode education credentials,\nwhich represents a considerable challenge to automated processing.\nConsequently, significant manual effort is required to verify credentials.\nIn this paper, we tackle these challenges by introducing a decentralized and\nopen system to automatically verify the legitimacy of issuers and interpret\ncredentials in unknown schemas. We do so by enabling participants to publish\ntransformation information, which enables verifiers to transform credentials\ninto their preferred schema. Due to the lack of a global root of trust, we\nutilize a distributed ledger to build a decentralized web of trust, which\nverifiers can query to gather information on the trustworthiness of issuing\ninstitutions and to establish trust in transformation information. Going beyond\ndiploma fraud, our system can be generalized to tackle the generalized problem\nfor other domains lacking a root of trust and agreements on data schemas.",

    "abstract": "Monte Carlo rendering algorithms are widely used to produce photorealistic\ncomputer graphics images. However, these algorithms need to sample a\nsubstantial amount of rays per pixel to enable proper global illumination and\nthus require an immense amount of computation. In this paper, we present a\nhybrid rendering method to speed up Monte Carlo rendering algorithms. Our\nmethod first generates two versions of a rendering: one at a low resolution\nwith a high sample rate (LRHS) and the other at a high resolution with a low\nsample rate (HRLS). We then develop a deep convolutional neural network to fuse\nthese two renderings into a high-quality image as if it were rendered at a high\nresolution with a high sample rate. Specifically, we formulate this fusion task\nas a super resolution problem that generates a high resolution rendering from a\nlow resolution input (LRHS), assisted with the HRLS rendering. The HRLS\nrendering provides critical high frequency details which are difficult to\nrecover from the LRHS for any super resolution methods. Our experiments show\nthat our hybrid rendering algorithm is significantly faster than the\nstate-of-the-art Monte Carlo denoising methods while rendering high-quality\nimages when tested on both our own BCR dataset and the Gharbi dataset.\n\\url{https://github.com/hqqxyy/msspl}",

However, when it is applied in interference networks,\nthe problem about information delay arises which has not been noticed yet. In\nthis paper, we first propose degree of delay (DoD) to quantify the issue of\ninformation delay, and characterize DoD for three typical transmission schemes,\ni.e., TDMA, beamforming based TDMA (BD-TDMA) and retrospective interference\nalignment (RIA). By analyzing DoD of these schemes, its value mainly depends on\nthree factors, i.e., delay sensitive factor, queueing delay slot and size of\ndataset. Therefore, to improve queueing delay slot and reduce DoD, three novel\njoint IA schemes are proposed for BC networks with different amounts of users.\nThat is, hybrid antenna array based partial interference elimination and\nretrospective interference regeneration scheme (HAA-PIE-RIR), HAA based\nimproved PIE and RIR scheme (HAA-IPIE-RIR) and HAA based cyclic interference\nelimination and RIR scheme (HAA-CIE-RIR). The second scheme extends the\napplication scenarios of the first scheme from 2-user to K-user while brings\nhuge computational burden. The third scheme relieves this computational\ncomplexity burden but it has somewhat degree of freedom (DoF) loss.

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the detection of a M-dimensional useful signal modeled as\nthe output of a M xK MIMO filter driven by a K-dimensional white Gaussian\nnoise, and corrupted by a M-dimensional Gaussian noise with mutually\nuncorrelated components. The study is focused on frequency domain test\nstatistics based on the eigenvalues of an estimate of the spectral coherence\nmatrix (SCM), obtained as a renormalization of the frequency-smoothed\nperiodogram of the observed signal. If N denotes the sample size and B the\nsmoothing span, it is proved that in the high-dimensional regime where M, B, N\nconverge to infinity while K remains fixed, the SCM behaves as a certain\ncorrelated Wishart matrix. Exploiting well-known results on the behaviour of\nthe eigenvalues of such matrices, it is deduced that the standard tests based\non linear spectral statistics of the SCM fail to detect the presence of the\nuseful signal in the high-dimensional regime. A new test based on the SCM,\nwhich is proved to be consistent, is also proposed, and its statistical\nperformance is evaluated through numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study algorithmic questions concerning products of matrices\nand their consequences for recognition algorithms for polyhedra.\nThe 1-product of matrices $S_1$, $S_2$ is a matrix whose columns are the\nconcatenation of each column of $S_1$ with each column of $S_2$. The\n$k$-product generalizes the $1$-product, by taking as input two matrices $S_1,\nS_2$ together with $k-1$ special rows of each of those matrices, and outputting\na certain composition of $S_1,S_2$.\nOur study is motivated by a close link between the 1-product of matrices and\nthe Cartesian product of polytopes, and more generally between the $k$-product\nof matrices and the glued product of polytopes. These connections rely on the\nconcept of slack matrix, which gives an algebraic representation of classes of\naffinely equivalent polytopes. The slack matrix recognition problem is the\nproblem of determining whether a given matrix is a slack matrix. This is an\nintriguing problem whose complexity is unknown. Our algorithm reduces the\nproblem to instances which cannot be expressed as $k$-products of smaller\nmatrices.\nIn the second part of the paper, we give a combinatorial interpretation of\n$k$-products for two well-known classes of polytopes: 2-level matroid base\npolytopes and stable set polytopes of perfect graphs. We also show that the\nslack matrix recognition problem is polynomial-time solvable for such\npolytopes. Those two classes are special cases of $2$-level polytopes, for\nwhich we conjecture that the slack matrix recognition problem is\npolynomial-time solvable.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid progress of deepfake techniques in recent years, facial video\nforgery can generate highly deceptive video contents and bring severe security\nthreats. And detection of such forgery videos is much more urgent and\nchallenging. Most existing detection methods treat the problem as a vanilla\nbinary classification problem. In this paper, the problem is treated as a\nspecial fine-grained classification problem since the differences between fake\nand real faces are very subtle. It is observed that most existing face forgery\nmethods left some common artifacts in the spatial domain and time domain,\nincluding generative defects in the spatial domain and inter-frame\ninconsistencies in the time domain. And a spatial-temporal model is proposed\nwhich has two components for capturing spatial and temporal forgery traces in\nglobal perspective respectively. The two components are designed using a novel\nlong distance attention mechanism. The one component of the spatial domain is\nused to capture artifacts in a single frame, and the other component of the\ntime domain is used to capture artifacts in consecutive frames. They generate\nattention maps in the form of patches. The attention method has a broader\nvision which contributes to better assembling global information and extracting\nlocal statistic information. Finally, the attention maps are used to guide the\nnetwork to focus on pivotal parts of the face, just like other fine-grained\nclassification methods. The experimental results on different public datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance,\nand the proposed long distance attention method can effectively capture pivotal\nparts for face forgery.",

Previous\nwork explored how embeddings can be obtained in zero-resource settings where no\nlabelled data is available in the target language.

However, it is still\nunclear how the specific choice of training languages affect downstream\nperformance. Concretely, here we ask whether it is beneficial to use training\nlanguages related to the target. Using data from eleven languages spoken in\nSouthern Africa, we experiment with adding data from different language\nfamilies while controlling for the amount of data per language. In word\ndiscrimination and query-by-example search evaluations, we show that training\non languages from the same family gives large improvements.

The part of the domain\nallocated to each compute unit is called a partition. Besides the balancing of\nthe work, the communication cost to exchange data between units determines the\nquality of a chosen partition. This cost can be approximated by the\nsurface-to-volume ratio of partitions: the volume represents the amount of\nlocal work, while the surface represents the amount of data to be transmitted.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that space-filling curves yield advantageous\nsurface-to-volume ratios. Formal proofs are available only for regular grids.\nWe investigate the surface-to-volume ratio of space-filling curve partitions\nfor adaptive grids and derive the maximum surface-to-volume ratio as a function\nof the number of cells in the partition. In order to prove our main theorem, we\nconstruct a new framework for the study of adaptive grids, notably introducing\nthe concepts of a shape and of classified partitions. The new methodological\nframework yields insight about the SFC-induced partition character even if the\ngrids refine rather aggressively in localised areas: it quantifies the obtained\nsurface-to-volume ratio.

The learning-based image stitching solutions are rarely studied\ndue to the lack of labeled data, making the supervised methods unreliable. To\naddress the above limitations, we propose an unsupervised deep image stitching\nframework consisting of two stages: unsupervised coarse image alignment and\nunsupervised image reconstruction. In the first stage, we design an\nablation-based loss to constrain an unsupervised homography network, which is\nmore suitable for large-baseline scenes. Moreover, a transformer layer is\nintroduced to warp the input images in the stitching-domain space. In the\nsecond stage, motivated by the insight that the misalignments in pixel-level\ncan be eliminated to a certain extent in feature-level, we design an\nunsupervised image reconstruction network to eliminate the artifacts from\nfeatures to pixels. Specifically, the reconstruction network can be implemented\nby a low-resolution deformation branch and a high-resolution refined branch,\nlearning the deformation rules of image stitching and enhancing the resolution\nsimultaneously. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning\nframework, a comprehensive real-world image dataset for unsupervised deep image\nstitching is presented and released.

Contra this, the most prominent syntax-based solution, the\nFagin-Halpern (FH) model, accounts for this distinction and offers a simple\nrepresentation of awareness, but lacks the intuitiveness of the lattice\nstructure. Here, we combine these two approaches by providing a lattice of\nKripke models, induced by atom subset inclusion, in which uncertainty and\nunawareness are separate. We show our model equivalent to both HMS and FH\nmodels by defining transformations between them which preserve satisfaction of\nformulas of a language for explicit knowledge, and obtain completeness through\nour and HMS' results.

    "abstract": "Multibeam high throughput satellite (MB-HTS) systems will play a key role in\ndelivering broadband services to a large number of users with diverse Quality\nof Service (QoS) requirements. This paper focuses on MB-HTS where the same\nspectrum is re-used by all user links and, in particular, we propose a novel\nuser scheduling design capable to provide guarantees in terms of individual QoS\nrequirements while maximizing the system throughput. This is achieved by\nprecoding to mitigate mutual interference. The combinatorial optimization\nstructure requires an extremely high cost to obtain the global optimum even\nwith a reduced number of users. We, therefore, propose a heuristic algorithm\nyielding a good local solution and tolerable computational complexity,\napplicable for large-scale networks. Numerical results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed algorithm on scheduling many users with better\nsum throughput than the other benchmarks. Besides, the QoS requirements for all\nscheduled users are guaranteed.",

Generally, process models are considered from\ntwo different perspectives: process modelers and readers. Both perspectives\nshare similarities and differences in the comprehension of process models\n(e.g., diverse experiences when working with process models). The literature\nproposed many rules and guidelines to ensure a proper comprehension of process\nmodels for both perspectives. As a novel contribution in this context, this\npaper introduces the Process Model Comprehension Framework (PMCF) as a first\nstep towards the measurement and quantification of the perspectives of process\nmodelers and readers as well as the interaction of both regarding the\ncomprehension of process models. Therefore, the PMCF describes an Evaluation\nTheory Tree based on the Communication Theory as well as the Conceptual\nModeling Quality Framework and considers a total of 96 quality metrics in order\nto quantify process model comprehension. Furthermore, the PMCF was evaluated in\na survey with 131 participants and has been implemented as well as applied\nsuccessfully in a practical case study including 33 participants. To conclude,\nthe PMCF allows for the identification of pitfalls and provides related\ninformation about how to assist process modelers as well as readers in order to\nfoster and enable a proper comprehension of process models.",

The antenna comprises of a L-shaped element which is coupled with a\nground shorted parasitic resonator to generate three resonant modes for\ntri-band operation. The L-shaped element which is placed on top of the\nsubstrate is fed by a 50$\\Omega$ microstrip feed line and is responsible for\nthe generation of a wide band at 5.5 GHz. The parasitic resonator is placed on\nthe other side of the substrate and is directly connected to the ground plane.\nThe presence of the parasitic resonator gives rise to two additional resonant\nbands at 2.3 GHz and 3.5 GHz. Thus, together the two elements generate three\nresonant bands to cover WLAN, WiMAX and Bluetooth bands of operation. A\nthorough parametric study has been performed on the antenna and it has been\nfound that the three bands can be tuned by varying certain dimensions of the\nantenna. Hence, the same design can be used for frequencies in adjacent bands\nas well with minor changes in its dimensions. Important antenna parameters such\nas return loss, radiation pattern and peak gains in the operating bands have\nbeen studied in detail to prove that the proposed design is a promising\ncandidate for the aforementioned wireless technologies.",

Evaluating the fixed-point\nformula that defines the winning region in a given game in an appropriate\nsemiring of polynomials provides not only the Boolean information on who wins,\nbut also tells us how they win and which strategies they might use. This is\nwell-understood for reachability games, where the winning region is definable\nas a least fixed point. The case of B\\\"uchi games is of special interest, not\nonly due to their practical importance, but also because it is the simplest\ncase where the fixed-point definition involves a genuine alternation of a\ngreatest and a least fixed point.\nWe show that, in a precise sense, semiring semantics provide information\nabout all absorption-dominant strategies -- strategies that win with minimal\neffort, and we discuss how these relate to positional and the more general\npersistent strategies. This information enables further applications such as\ngame synthesis or determining minimal modifications to the game needed to\nchange its outcome.

In previous work, a 3-step method was proposed to generate\nhigh-quality TTS while greatly reducing the amount of data required for\ntraining. However, we have observed a ceiling effect in the level of\nnaturalness achievable for highly expressive voices when using this approach.\nIn this paper, we present a method for building highly expressive TTS voices\nwith as little as 15 minutes of speech data from the target speaker. Compared\nto the current state-of-the-art approach, our proposed improvements close the\ngap to recordings by 23.3% for naturalness of speech and by 16.3% for speaker\nsimilarity. Further, we match the naturalness and speaker similarity of a\nTacotron2-based full-data (~10 hours) model using only 15 minutes of target\nspeaker data, whereas with 30 minutes or more, we significantly outperform it.\nThe following improvements are proposed: 1) changing from an autoregressive,\nattention-based TTS model to a non-autoregressive model replacing attention\nwith an external duration model and 2) an additional Conditional Generative\nAdversarial Network (cGAN) based fine-tuning step.",

The studies suggest that neural networks can provide good\npredictions of Dengue and should be included in the set of candidate models.\nThe use of convolutional, recurrent, or deep networks is relatively unexplored\nbut offers promising avenues for further research, as does the use of a broader\nset of input features such as social media or mobile phone data.",

    "abstract": "The information bottleneck (IB) principle has been suggested as a way to\nanalyze deep neural networks. The learning dynamics are studied by inspecting\nthe mutual information (MI) between the hidden layers and the input and output.\nNotably, separate fitting and compression phases during training have been\nreported. This led to some controversy including claims that the observations\nare not reproducible and strongly dependent on the type of activation function\nused as well as on the way the MI is estimated. Our study confirms that\ndifferent ways of binning when computing the MI lead to qualitatively different\nresults, either supporting or refusing IB conjectures. To resolve the\ncontroversy, we study the IB principle in settings where MI is non-trivial and\ncan be computed exactly. We monitor the dynamics of quantized neural networks,\nthat is, we discretize the whole deep learning system so that no approximation\nis required when computing the MI. This allows us to quantify the information\nflow without measurement errors. In this setting, we observed a fitting phase\nfor all layers and a compression phase for the output layer in all experiments;\nthe compression in the hidden layers was dependent on the type of activation\nfunction. Our study shows that the initial IB results were not artifacts of\nbinning when computing the MI. However, the critical claim that the compression\nphase may not be observed for some networks also holds true.",

    "abstract": "The ASVspoof Dataset is one of the most established datasets for training and\nbenchmarking systems designed for the detection of spoofed audio and audio\ndeepfakes. However, we observe an uneven distribution of leading silence in\ndataset's training and test data, which hints at the target label: Bona-fide\ninstances tend to have significantly longer leading silences than spoofed\ninstances. This could be problematic, since a model may learn to only, or at\nleast partially, base its decision on the length of the leading silence\n(similar to the issue with the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset, where all images of\nhorses also contained a specific watermark). In this paper, we explore this\nphenomenon in depth. We train a number of networks on only a) the length of the\nleading silence and b) with and without leading silence. Results show that\nmodels trained on only the length of the leading silence perform suspiciously\nwell: They achieve up to 85% percent accuracy and an equal error rate (EER) of\n0.15 on the 'eval' split of the data. Conversely, when training strong models\non the full audio files, we observe that removing leading silence during\npreprocessing dramatically worsens performance (EER increases from 0.05 to\n0.2). This could indicate that previous work may, in part, have learned only to\nclassify targets based on leading silence. We hope that by sharing these\nresults, the ASV community can further evaluate this phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success on various tasks and\nfields that require relational modeling. GNNs aggregate node features using the\ngraph structure as inductive biases resulting in flexible and powerful models.\nHowever, GNNs remain hard to interpret as the interplay between node features\nand graph structure is only implicitly learned. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel method called Kedge for explicitly sparsifying the underlying graph by\nremoving unnecessary neighbors. Our key idea is based on a tractable method for\nsparsification using the Hard Kumaraswamy distribution that can be used in\nconjugation with any GNN model. Kedge learns edge masks in a modular fashion\ntrained with any GNN allowing for gradient based optimization in an end-to-end\nfashion. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our model Kedge can\nprune a large proportion of the edges with only a minor effect on the test\naccuracy. Specifically, in the PubMed dataset, Kedge learns to drop more than\n80% of the edges with an accuracy drop of merely 2% showing that graph\nstructure has only a small contribution in comparison to node features.\nFinally, we also show that Kedge effectively counters the over-smoothing\nphenomena in deep GNNs by maintaining good task performance with increasing GNN\nlayers.",

Machine Learning (ML) techniques show promise as diagnostic aids in\nhealthcare. Material and methods: We investigated the following features\nseeking to investigate their performance in predicting hospital admission:\nserum levels of Urea, Creatinine, Lactate Dehydrogenase, Creatine Kinase,\nC-Reactive Protein, Complete Blood Count with differential, Activated Partial\nThromboplastin Time, D Dimer, International Normalized Ratio, age, gender,\ntriage disposition to ED unit and ambulance utilization. A total of 3,204 ED\nvisits were analyzed. Results: The proposed algorithms generated models which\ndemonstrated acceptable performance in predicting hospital admission of ED\npatients. The range of F-measure and ROC Area values of all eight evaluated\nalgorithms were [0.679-0.708] and [0.734-0.774], respectively. Discussion: The\nmain advantages of this tool include easy access, availability, yes/no result,\nand low cost. The clinical implications of our approach might facilitate a\nshift from traditional clinical decision-making to a more sophisticated model.\nConclusion: Developing robust prognostic models with the utilization of common\nbiomarkers is a project that might shape the future of emergency medicine.

    "abstract": "Spatial-temporal forecasting has attracted tremendous attention in a wide\nrange of applications, and traffic flow prediction is a canonical and typical\nexample. The complex and long-range spatial-temporal correlations of traffic\nflow bring it to a most intractable challenge. Existing works typically utilize\nshallow graph convolution networks (GNNs) and temporal extracting modules to\nmodel spatial and temporal dependencies respectively. However, the\nrepresentation ability of such models is limited due to: (1) shallow GNNs are\nincapable to capture long-range spatial correlations, (2) only spatial\nconnections are considered and a mass of semantic connections are ignored,\nwhich are of great importance for a comprehensive understanding of traffic\nnetworks. To this end, we propose Spatial-Temporal Graph Ordinary Differential\nEquation Networks (STGODE). Specifically, we capture spatial-temporal dynamics\nthrough a tensor-based ordinary differential equation (ODE), as a result,\ndeeper networks can be constructed and spatial-temporal features are utilized\nsynchronously. To understand the network more comprehensively, semantical\nadjacency matrix is considered in our model, and a well-design temporal\ndialated convolution structure is used to capture long term temporal\ndependencies.

Ideally, a focus on a\nparticular practice method should be made in a way to maximize the learner's\nprogress in learning to play the piano. Because we each learn differently, and\nbecause there are many choices for possible piano practice tasks and methods,\nthe set of practice tasks should be dynamically adapted to the human learner.\nHowever, having a human teacher guide individual practice is not always\nfeasible since it is time consuming, expensive, and not always available.\nInstead, we suggest to optimize in the space of practice methods, the so-called\npractice modes. The proposed optimization process takes into account the skills\nof the individual learner and their history of learning. In this work we\npresent a modeling framework to guide the human learner through the learning\nprocess by choosing practice modes that have the highest expected utility\n(i.e., improvement in piano playing skill).

In this\npaper, we propose a novel architecture, Temporal Routing Adaptor (TRA), to\nempower existing stock prediction models with the ability to model multiple\nstock trading patterns. Essentially, TRA is a lightweight module that consists\nof a set of independent predictors for learning multiple patterns as well as a\nrouter to dispatch samples to different predictors. Nevertheless, the lack of\nexplicit pattern identifiers makes it quite challenging to train an effective\nTRA-based model. To tackle this challenge, we further design a learning\nalgorithm based on Optimal Transport (OT) to obtain the optimal sample to\npredictor assignment and effectively optimize the router with such assignment\nthrough an auxiliary loss term. Experiments on the real-world stock ranking\ntask show that compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, e.g., Attention LSTM\nand Transformer, the proposed method can improve information coefficient (IC)\nfrom 0.053 to 0.059 and 0.051 to 0.056 respectively.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised deep learning methods have leveraged stereo images for\ntraining monocular depth estimation. Although these methods show strong results\non outdoor datasets such as KITTI, they do not match performance of supervised\nmethods on indoor environments with camera rotation. Indoor, rotated scenes are\ncommon for less constrained applications and pose problems for two reasons:\nabundance of low texture regions and increased complexity of depth cues for\nimages under rotation. In an effort to extend self-supervised learning to more\ngeneralised environments we propose two additions. First, we propose a novel\nFilled Disparity Loss term that corrects for ambiguity of image reconstruction\nerror loss in textureless regions. Specifically, we interpolate disparity in\nuntextured regions, using the estimated disparity from surrounding textured\nareas, and use L1 loss to correct the original estimation. Our experiments show\nthat depth estimation is substantially improved on low-texture scenes, without\nany loss on textured scenes, when compared to Monodepth by Godard et al.\nSecondly, we show that training with an application's representative rotations,\nin both pitch and roll, is sufficient to significantly improve performance over\nthe entire range of expected rotation. We demonstrate that depth estimation is\nsuccessfully generalised as performance is not lost when evaluated on test sets\nwith no camera rotation. Together these developments enable a broader use of\nself-supervised learning of monocular depth estimation for complex\nenvironments.",

In this setting, Novelty Detection\nbecomes more important, interesting and challenging.

Recent algorithms such as deep\nlearning-based convolutional neural networks have achieved high accuracy and\nreal-time performance, but they usually need to know the classes of targets in\nadvance, which limits the practical applications. Therefore, we proposed a\nmodel free moving target detection algorithm. This algorithm extracts the\nmoving area through the difference of image features. Then, the color and\nlocation probability map of the moving area will be calculated through maximum\na posteriori probability. And the target probability map can be obtained\nthrough the dot multiply between the two maps. Finally, the optimal moving\ntarget area can be solved by stochastic gradient descent on the target\nprobability map. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the highest\naccuracy compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, without needing to know the\nclasses of targets.

Heyman's assumptions of infinite compressive and vanishing tensile\nstrengths are made, with cohesionless friction behavior governing the shear\nstrength, to characterize the admissible stress states in the dome. An original\ncomputational strategy is developed to address the resulting static limit\nanalysis problem, involving the introduction of a mesh on the dome mid-surface,\nthe interpolation of the physical components of the shell stress tensors on the\nelement boundaries, and the imposition of equilibrium and admissibility\nconditions respectively for the elements and at the nodes of the mesh. The\ndescending discrete convex optimization problem is solved by standard and\neffective optimization tools, automatically providing collapse multiplier of\nhorizontal forces, incipient collapse mechanism and expected crack pattern.\nConvergence analysis, validation with experimental results available in the\nliterature, and parametric analyses with respect to geometric parameters and\nfriction coefficient, are presented for spherical and ellipsoidal masonry\ndomes, proving the reliability of the proposed approach for estimating the\npseudo-static seismic resistance of masonry domes.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of laboratory animal behavior is of central interest in modern\nneuroscience research. Behavior is typically studied in terms of pose changes,\nwhich are ideally captured in three dimensions. This requires triangulation\nover a multi-camera system which view the animal from different angles.\nHowever, this is challenging in realistic laboratory setups due to occlusions\nand other technical constrains. Here we propose the usage of lift-pose models\nthat allow for robust 3D pose estimation of freely moving rodents from a single\nview camera view. To obtain high-quality training data for the pose-lifting, we\nfirst perform geometric calibration in a camera setup involving bottom as well\nas side views of the behaving animal. We then evaluate the performance of two\npreviously proposed model architectures under given inference perspectives and\nconclude that reliable 3D pose inference can be obtained using temporal\nconvolutions. With this work we would like to contribute to a more robust and\ndiverse behavior tracking of freely moving rodents for a wide range of\nexperiments and setups in the neuroscience community.",

    "abstract": "Depth completion aims to generate a dense depth map from the sparse depth map\nand aligned RGB image. However, current depth completion methods use extremely\nexpensive 64-line LiDAR(about $100,000) to obtain sparse depth maps, which will\nlimit their application scenarios. Compared with the 64-line LiDAR, the\nsingle-line LiDAR is much less expensive and much more robust. Therefore, we\npropose a method to tackle the problem of single-line depth completion, in\nwhich we aim to generate a dense depth map from the single-line LiDAR info and\nthe aligned RGB image. A single-line depth completion dataset is proposed based\non the existing 64-line depth completion dataset(KITTI). A network called\nSemantic Guided Two-Branch Network(SGTBN) which contains global and local\nbranches to extract and fuse global and local info is proposed for this task. A\nSemantic guided depth upsampling module is used in our network to make full use\nof the semantic info in RGB images. Except for the usual MSE loss, we add the\nvirtual normal loss to increase the constraint of high-order 3D geometry in our\nnetwork. Our network outperforms the state-of-the-art in the single-line depth\ncompletion task.

We implement a\nframework that employs the Linux kernel's userfault mechanism to fill the\ncontents of runtime objects on demand.

The back-end can generate data from thin air, calculate it from a\nformula, or retrieve it from persistent storage, the network, or other sources\n(with or without post-processing). UFOs follow the memory layout of standard\nruntime objects, so they can be introspected and written to safely. The\nframework manages the loading and unloading of object segments to ensure that\nmemory is reclaimed as needed and data is never lost. This allows the UFO\nframework to implement larger-than-memory data structures that never\nmaterialize into memory in full. Implementing objects as UFOs also impacts\nperformance, since overhead of populating memory is amortized by loading entire\npages of data at a time.

This paper studies the \\textit{long-term forecasting} problem of time\nseries. Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms\nto discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns\nof the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies.\nAlso, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise\nself-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information\nutilization bottleneck. Towards these challenges, we propose Autoformer as a\nnovel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We go\nbeyond the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as\na basic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with\nprogressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired\nby the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism\nbased on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and\nrepresentation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation\noutperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term\nforecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative\nimprovement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy,\ntraffic, economics, weather and disease.",

While this runtime permission model provides users\nwith greater flexibility in controlling an app's access to sensitive data and\nsystem features, it brings new challenges to app development. First, as users\nmay grant or revoke permissions at any time while they are using an app,\ndevelopers need to ensure that the app properly checks and requests required\npermissions before invoking any permission-protected APIs. Second, Android's\npermission mechanism keeps evolving and getting customized by device\nmanufacturers. Developers are expected to comprehensively test their apps on\ndifferent Android versions and device models to make sure permissions are\nproperly requested in all situations. Unfortunately, these requirements are\noften impractical for developers. In practice, many Android apps suffer from\nvarious runtime permission issues (ARP issues).\nWhile existing studies have explored ARP issues, the understanding of such\nissues is still preliminary. To better characterize ARP issues, we performed an\nempirical study using 135 Stack Overflow posts that discuss ARP issues and 199\nreal ARP issues archived in popular open-source Android projects on GitHub. Via\nanalyzing the data, we observed 11 types of ARP issues that commonly occur in\nAndroid apps.

However, most of the traditional IA schemes suffer from the high\ncomputational complexity and require the global and instantaneous channel state\ninformation (CSI), both of which make them difficult to be extended to cellular\nMIMO systems. To handle these issues, two new interference alignment schemes,\ni.e., the retrospective interference regeneration (RIR) scheme and the\nbeamforming based distributed retrospective interference alignment (B-DRIA)\nscheme, are proposed for cellular K-user MIMO downlink networks. For the RIR\nscheme, it adopts interference elimination algorithm to erase redundant symbols\nin inter-cell interference (ICI) signals, and then uses interference\nregeneration algorithm to avoid secondary interference. The RIR scheme obtains\ngreater DoF gain than the retrospective interference alignment (RIA) scheme,\nbut incurs performance degradation when the transceiver antennas ratio (TAR)\napproaches 1. Therefore, the B-DRIA scheme is further proposed. For the B-DRIA\nscheme, the cellular beamforming matrix is introduced to eliminate the ICI, and\nmeanwhile distributed retrospective interference alignment algorithm is adopted\nto align inter-user interference (IUI). The simulation results show that the\nB-DRIA scheme obtains larger DoF than the RIR scheme locally. Specifically,\nwhen TAR approaches 1, two schemes obtain the same DoF.

To handle these issues, this paper provides a novel\nProgrEssively Region-based scene Text eraser (PERT), which introduces\nregion-based modification strategy to progressively erase the pixels in only\ntext region. Firstly, PERT decomposes the STR task to several erasing stages.\nAs each stage aims to take a further step toward the text-removed image rather\nthan directly regress to the final result, the decomposed operation reduces the\nlearning difficulty in each stage, and an exhaustive erasure result can be\nobtained by iterating over lightweight erasing blocks with shared parameters.\nThen, PERT introduces a region-based modification strategy to ensure the\nintegrity of text-free areas by decoupling text localization from erasure\nprocess to guide the removal. Benefiting from the simplicity architecture, PERT\nis a simple and strong baseline, and is easy to be followed and developed.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that PERT obtains the state-of-the-art\nresults on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

    "abstract": "Convolutional networks are ubiquitous in deep learning. They are particularly\nuseful for images, as they reduce the number of parameters, reduce training\ntime, and increase accuracy. However, as a model of the brain they are\nseriously problematic, since they require weight sharing - something real\nneurons simply cannot do. Consequently, while neurons in the brain can be\nlocally connected (one of the features of convolutional networks), they cannot\nbe convolutional. Locally connected but non-convolutional networks, however,\nsignificantly underperform convolutional ones. This is troublesome for studies\nthat use convolutional networks to explain activity in the visual system. Here\nwe study plausible alternatives to weight sharing that aim at the same\nregularization principle, which is to make each neuron within a pool react\nsimilarly to identical inputs. The most natural way to do that is by showing\nthe network multiple translations of the same image, akin to saccades in animal\nvision. However, this approach requires many translations, and doesn't remove\nthe performance gap. We propose instead to add lateral connectivity to a\nlocally connected network, and allow learning via Hebbian plasticity. This\nrequires the network to pause occasionally for a sleep-like phase of \"weight\nsharing\". This method enables locally connected networks to achieve nearly\nconvolutional performance on ImageNet, thus supporting convolutional networks\nas a model of the visual stream.",

    "abstract": "In federated learning (FL), model training is distributed over clients and\nlocal models are aggregated by a central server. The performance of uploaded\nmodels in such situations can vary widely due to imbalanced data distributions,\npotential demands on privacy protections, and quality of transmissions. In this\npaper, we aim to minimize FL training delay over wireless channels, constrained\nby overall training performance as well as each client's differential privacy\n(DP) requirement. We solve this problem in the framework of multi-agent\nmulti-armed bandit (MAMAB) to deal with the situation where there are multiple\nclients confornting different unknown transmission environments, e.g., channel\nfading and interferences. Specifically, we first transform the long-term\nconstraints on both training performance and each client's DP into a virtual\nqueue based on the Lyapunov drift technique. Then, we convert the MAMAB to a\nmax-min bipartite matching problem at each communication round, by estimating\nrewards with the upper confidence bound (UCB) approach. More importantly, we\npropose two efficient solutions to this matching problem, i.e., modified\nHungarian algorithm and greedy matching with a better alternative (GMBA), in\nwhich the first one can achieve the optimal solution with a high complexity\nwhile the second one approaches a better trade-off by enabling a verified\nlow-complexity with little performance loss. In addition, we develop an upper\nbound on the expected regret of this MAMAB based FL framework, which shows a\nlinear growth over the logarithm of communication rounds, justifying its\ntheoretical feasibility. Extensive experimental results are conducted to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, and the impacts of\nvarious parameters on the FL performance over wireless edge networks are also\ndiscussed.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the 3D world from 2D projected natural images is a fundamental\nchallenge in computer vision and graphics. Recently, an unsupervised learning\napproach has garnered considerable attention owing to its advantages in data\ncollection. However, to mitigate training limitations, typical methods need to\nimpose assumptions for viewpoint distribution (e.g., a dataset containing\nvarious viewpoint images) or object shape (e.g., symmetric objects). These\nassumptions often restrict applications; for instance, the application to\nnon-rigid objects or images captured from similar viewpoints (e.g., flower or\nbird images) remains a challenge. To complement these approaches, we propose\naperture rendering generative adversarial networks (AR-GANs), which equip\naperture rendering on top of GANs, and adopt focus cues to learn the depth and\ndepth-of-field (DoF) effect of unlabeled natural images. To address the\nambiguities triggered by unsupervised setting (i.e., ambiguities between smooth\ntexture and out-of-focus blurs, and between foreground and background blurs),\nwe develop DoF mixture learning, which enables the generator to learn real\nimage distribution while generating diverse DoF images. In addition, we devise\na center focus prior to guiding the learning direction. In the experiments, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of AR-GANs in various datasets, such as flower,\nbird, and face images, demonstrate their portability by incorporating them into\nother 3D representation learning GANs, and validate their applicability in\nshallow DoF rendering.",

The key difference between PFL and conventional FL lies\nin the training target, of which the personalized models in PFL usually pursue\na trade-off between personalization (i.e., usually from local models) and\ngeneralization (i.e., usually from the global model) on trained models.\nConventional FL methods can hardly meet this target because of their both\nwell-developed global and local models. The prevalent PFL approaches usually\nmaintain a global model to guide the training process of local models and\ntransfer a proper degree of generalization to them. However, the sole global\nmodel can only provide one direction of generalization and may even transfer\nnegative effects to some local models when rich statistical diversity exists\nacross multiple local datasets. Based on our observation, most real or\nsynthetic data distributions usually tend to be clustered to some degree, of\nwhich we argue different directions of generalization can facilitate the PFL.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel concept called clustered generalization to\nhandle the challenge of statistical heterogeneity in FL.

Three tracks were proposed in which\nvisual inpainting might be helpful but still challenging: human body pose\nestimation, text overlays removal and fingerprint denoising. This chapter\ndescribes the design of the challenge, which includes the release of three\nnovel datasets, and the description of evaluation metrics, baselines and\nevaluation protocol. The results of the challenge are analyzed and discussed in\ndetail and conclusions derived from this event are outlined.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning is emerging as a machine learning technique that trains a\nmodel across multiple decentralized parties. It is renowned for preserving\nprivacy as the data never leaves the computational devices, and recent\napproaches further enhance its privacy by hiding messages transferred in\nencryption. However, we found that despite the efforts, federated learning\nremains privacy-threatening, due to its interactive nature across different\nparties. In this paper, we analyze the privacy threats in industrial-level\nfederated learning frameworks with secure computation, and reveal such threats\nwidely exist in typical machine learning models such as linear regression,\nlogistic regression and decision tree. For the linear and logistic regression,\nwe show through theoretical analysis that it is possible for the attacker to\ninvert the entire private input of the victim, given very few information. For\nthe decision tree model, we launch an attack to infer the range of victim's\nprivate inputs. All attacks are evaluated on popular federated learning\nframeworks and real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "We consider the approximability of constraint satisfaction problems in the\nstreaming setting. For every constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) on $n$\nvariables taking values in $\\{0,\\ldots,q-1\\}$, we prove that improving over the\ntrivial approximability by a factor of $q$ requires $\\Omega(n)$ space even on\ninstances with $O(n)$ constraints. We also identify a broad subclass of\nproblems for which any improvement over the trivial approximability requires\n$\\Omega(n)$ space. The key technical core is an optimal,\n$q^{-(k-1)}$-inapproximability for the case where every constraint is given by\na system of $k-1$ linear equations $\\bmod\\; q$ over $k$ variables. Prior to our\nwork, no such hardness was known for an approximation factor less than $1/2$\nfor any CSP. Our work builds on and extends the work of Kapralov and Krachun\n(Proc. STOC 2019) who showed a linear lower bound on any non-trivial\napproximation of the max cut in graphs. This corresponds roughly to the case of\nMax $k$-LIN-$\\bmod\\; q$ with $k=q=2$.

However, existing benchmarks generally\nsuffer from low levels of user diversity, limited user information and data\nscarcity. Therefore, these datasets are not sufficient to train and stably\nbenchmark bot detection measures. To alleviate these problems, we present\nTwiBot-20, a massive Twitter bot detection benchmark, which contains 229,573\nusers, 33,488,192 tweets, 8,723,736 user property items and 455,958 follow\nrelationships. TwiBot-20 covers diversified bots and genuine users to better\nrepresent the real-world Twittersphere. TwiBot-20 also includes three modals of\nuser information to support both binary classification of single users and\ncommunity-aware approaches. To the best of our knowledge, TwiBot-20 is the\nlargest Twitter bot detection benchmark to date. We reproduce competitive bot\ndetection methods and conduct a thorough evaluation on TwiBot-20 and two other\npublic datasets. Experiment results demonstrate that existing bot detection\nmeasures fail to match their previously claimed performance on TwiBot-20, which\nsuggests that Twitter bot detection remains a challenging task and requires\nfurther research efforts.",

To address the two challenges\nof Twitter bot detection, we propose SATAR, a self-supervised representation\nlearning framework of Twitter users, and apply it to the task of bot detection.\nIn particular, SATAR generalizes by jointly leveraging the semantics, property\nand neighborhood information of a specific user. Meanwhile, SATAR adapts by\npre-training on a massive number of self-supervised users and fine-tuning on\ndetailed bot detection scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SATAR\noutperforms competitive baselines on different bot detection datasets of\nvarying information completeness and collection time.

    "abstract": "The black-box nature of machine learning models limits their use in\ncase-critical applications, raising faithful and ethical concerns that lead to\ntrust crises. One possible way to mitigate this issue is to understand how a\n(mispredicted) decision is carved out from the decision boundary. This paper\npresents a human-in-the-loop approach to explain machine learning models using\nverbatim neighborhood manifestation. Contrary to most of the current\neXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems, which provide hit-or-miss\napproximate explanations, our approach generates the local decision boundary of\nthe given instance and enables human intelligence to conclude the model\nbehavior. Our method can be divided into three stages: 1) a neighborhood\ngeneration stage, which generates instances based on the given sample; 2) a\nclassification stage, which yields classifications on the generated instances\nto carve out the local decision boundary and delineate the model behavior; and\n3) a human-in-the-loop stage, which involves human to refine and explore the\nneighborhood of interest. In the generation stage, a generative model is used\nto generate the plausible synthetic neighbors around the given instance. After\nthe classification stage, the classified neighbor instances provide a\nmultifaceted understanding of the model behavior. Three intervention points are\nprovided in the human-in-the-loop stage, enabling humans to leverage their own\nintelligence to interpret the model behavior. Several experiments on two\ndatasets are conducted, and the experimental results demonstrate the potential\nof our proposed approach for boosting human understanding of the complex\nmachine learning model.",

    "abstract": "The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) has become universal during\nthe past decade, which has afforded in-depth data-based research. By learning\nfrom the large amount of healthcare data, various data-driven models have been\nbuilt to predict future events for different medical tasks, such as auto\ndiagnosis and heart-attack prediction. Although EHR is abundant, the population\nthat satisfies specific criteria for learning population-specific tasks is\nscarce, making it challenging to train data-hungry deep learning models. This\nstudy presents the Claim Pre-Training (Claim-PT) framework, a generic\npre-training model that first trains on the entire pediatric claims dataset,\nfollowed by a discriminative fine-tuning on each population-specific task. The\nsemantic meaning of medical events can be captured in the pre-training stage,\nand the effective knowledge transfer is completed through the task-aware\nfine-tuning stage. The fine-tuning process requires minimal parameter\nmodification without changing the model architecture, which mitigates the data\nscarcity issue and helps train the deep learning model adequately on small\npatient cohorts. We conducted experiments on a real-world claims dataset with\nmore than one million patient records. Experimental results on two downstream\ntasks demonstrated the effectiveness of our method: our general task-agnostic\npre-training framework outperformed tailored task-specific models, achieving\nmore than 10\\% higher in model performance as compared to baselines. In\naddition, our framework showed a great generalizability potential to transfer\nlearned knowledge from one institution to another, paving the way for future\nhealthcare model pre-training across institutions.",

This\ninfectious respiratory disease has spread rapidly across more than 3000\ncounties and 50 states in the U.S. and have exhibited evolutionary clustering\nand complex triggering patterns. It is essential to understand the complex\nspacetime intertwined propagation of this disease so that accurate prediction\nor smart external intervention can be carried out. In this paper, we model the\npropagation of the COVID-19 as spatio-temporal point processes and propose a\ngenerative and intensity-free model to track the spread of the disease. We\nfurther adopt a generative adversarial imitation learning framework to learn\nthe model parameters. In comparison with the traditional likelihood-based\nlearning methods, this imitation learning framework does not need to prespecify\nan intensity function, which alleviates the model-misspecification. Moreover,\nthe adversarial learning procedure bypasses the difficult-to-evaluate integral\ninvolved in the likelihood evaluation, which makes the model inference more\nscalable with the data and variables. We showcase the dynamic learning\nperformance on the COVID-19 confirmed cases in the U.S. and evaluate the social\ndistancing policy based on the learned generative model.",

Based on this\npremise, we propose a framework for combining skills using the formalism of\noptions. We show that every deterministic option can be unambiguously\nrepresented as a cumulant defined in an extended domain. Building on this\ninsight and on previous results on transfer learning, we show how to\napproximate options whose cumulants are linear combinations of the cumulants of\nknown options. This means that, once we have learned options associated with a\nset of cumulants, we can instantaneously synthesise options induced by any\nlinear combination of them, without any learning involved. We describe how this\nframework provides a hierarchical interface to the environment whose abstract\nactions correspond to combinations of basic skills.

Such events are useful for early warning for accident, protest, election\nor breaking news. However, neither the list of events nor the resolution of\nboth event time and space is fixed or known beforehand. In this work, we\npropose an online spatio-temporal event detection system using social media\nthat is able to detect events at different time and space resolutions. First,\nto address the challenge related to the unknown spatial resolution of events, a\nquad-tree method is exploited in order to split the geographical space into\nmultiscale regions based on the density of social media data. Then, a\nstatistical unsupervised approach is performed that involves Poisson\ndistribution and a smoothing method for highlighting regions with unexpected\ndensity of social posts. Further, event duration is precisely estimated by\nmerging events happening in the same region at consecutive time intervals. A\npost processing stage is introduced to filter out events that are spam, fake or\nwrong. Finally, we incorporate simple semantics by using social media entities\nto assess the integrity, and accuracy of detected events. The proposed method\nis evaluated using different social media datasets: Twitter and Flickr for\ndifferent cities: Melbourne, London, Paris and New York. To verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, we compare our results with two baseline\nalgorithms based on fixed split of geographical space and clustering method.\nFor performance evaluation, we manually compute recall and precision.

Many research\nquestions have been raised about this topic. For example, drone-enabled\nwildlife monitoring has received much attention in recent years. Unfortunately,\nthis approach results in significant disturbance to different species of wild\nanimals. Moreover, with the capability of rapidly moving communication supply\ntowards demand when required, the drone equipped with a base station, i.e.,\ndrone-cell, is becoming a promising solution for providing cellular networks to\nvictims and rescue teams in disaster-affected areas. However, few studies have\ninvestigated the optimal deployments of multiple drone-cells with limited\nbackhaul communication distances. In addition, the use of autonomous drones as\nflying interactors for many real-life applications has not been sufficiently\ndiscussed.

Nevertheless, previous studies of autonomous drones have not dealt\nwith such applications in much detail.

    "abstract": "Transient stability has been extensively studied in the framework of Lyapunov\nstability. Theorists are interested in the convergence of all states to certain\npost-disturbance equilibrium, while practitioners often assess transient\nstability solely based on convergence to nominal frequencies and steady-state\nvoltages, which we refer to as augmented synchronization. Despite substantial\nresults, conventional transient stability theories suffer from the stringent\nrequirement of prior knowledge of the post-disturbance equilibrium. On the\nother hand, the wisdom from practice seems to provide an\nequilibrium-independent approach, although one intriguing and worrying question\nremains: does the convergence of frequencies and voltages always imply\nconvergence of all states? This paper aims to bridge such a theory-practice gap\nby pursuing two objectives. First, we derive checkable conditions under which\nconverging to augmented synchronization implies convergence of all states to\nthe equilibrium set, and hence lay a theoretical foundation for the empirical\nwisdom. Second, we establish several theorems that answer under what conditions\nthe power system can converge to augmented synchronization. These two results\nenable a new equilibrium-independent analytic for transient stability, which\nessentially re-defines the nominal motion of power systems as augmented\nsynchronization rather than certain equilibrium. This new methodology is\npromising especially when the post-disturbance equilibrium is unknown or\nnon-isolated equilibria exit, in which cases the conventional methods cannot\napply. Rudimentary single-machine examples and the IEEE 9-bus benchmark system\nwell verify our results and illustrate interesting implications.",

More specifically, RISs are\ndeployed under the UAVs termed as UAVs-RISs that operate over the micro-wave\n($\\mu$W) channel in the sky to sustain a strong line-of-sight (LoS) connection\nwith the ground users. The macro-cell operates over the $\\mu$W channel based on\northogonal multiple access (OMA), while small base stations (SBSs) operate over\nthe millimeter-wave (mmW) channel based on non-orthogonal multiple access\n(NOMA). We study the problem of total transmit power minimization by jointly\noptimizing the trajectory/velocity of each UAV, RISs' phase shifts, subcarrier\nallocations, and active beamformers at each BS. The underlying problem is\nhighly non-convex and the global optimal solution is intractable. To handle it,\nwe decompose the original problem into two subproblems, i.e., a subproblem\nwhich deals with the UAVs' trajectories/velocities, RISs' phase shifts, and\nsubcarrier allocations for $\\mu$W; and a subproblem for active beamforming\ndesign and subcarrier allocation for mmW. In particular, we solve the first\nsubproblem via the dueling deep Q-Network (DQN) learning approach by developing\na distributed algorithm which leads to a better policy evaluation. Then, we\nsolve the active beamforming design and subcarrier allocation for the mmW via\nthe successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results exhibit\nthe effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation scheme compared to other\nbaseline schemes. In particular, it is revealed that by deploying UAVs-RISs,\nthe transmit power can be reduced by 6 dBm while maintaining similar guaranteed\nQoS.",

In this paper, we propose a morph attack detection\nalgorithm that leverages an undecimated 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for\nidentifying morphed face images. The core of our framework is that artifacts\nresulting from the morphing process that are not discernible in the image\ndomain can be more easily identified in the spatial frequency domain. A\ndiscriminative wavelet sub-band can accentuate the disparity between a real and\na morphed image. To this end, multi-level DWT is applied to all images,\nyielding 48 mid and high-frequency sub-bands each. The entropy distributions\nfor each sub-band are calculated separately for both bona fide and morph\nimages. For some of the sub-bands, there is a marked difference between the\nentropy of the sub-band in a bona fide image and the identical sub-band's\nentropy in a morphed image. Consequently, we employ Kullback-Liebler Divergence\n(KLD) to exploit these differences and isolate the sub-bands that are the most\ndiscriminative. We measure how discriminative a sub-band is by its KLD value\nand the 22 sub-bands with the highest KLD values are chosen for network\ntraining. Then, we train a deep Siamese neural network using these 22 selected\nsub-bands for differential morph attack detection.

As part of the collaboration between\nNovartis and the Oxford Big Data Institute, we generate a synthetic dataset\nbased on COSENTYX (secukinumab) Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) clinical study. We\napply an Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ac-GAN) to generate synthetic magnetic\nresonance images (MRIs) of vertebral units (VUs). The images are conditioned on\nthe VU location (cervical, thoracic and lumbar). In this paper, we present a\nmethod for generating a synthetic dataset and conduct an in-depth analysis on\nits properties of along three key metrics: image fidelity, sample diversity and\ndataset privacy.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative learning, which enables collaborative and decentralized\ntraining of deep neural networks at multiple institutions in a\nprivacy-preserving manner, is rapidly emerging as a valuable technique in\nhealthcare applications. However, its distributed nature often leads to\nsignificant heterogeneity in data distributions across institutions. Existing\ncollaborative learning approaches generally do not account for the presence of\nheterogeneity in data among institutions, or only mildly skewed label\ndistributions are studied. In this paper, we present a novel generative replay\nstrategy to address the challenge of data heterogeneity in collaborative\nlearning methods. Instead of directly training a model for task performance, we\nleverage recent image synthesis techniques to develop a novel dual model\narchitecture: a primary model learns the desired task, and an auxiliary\n\"generative replay model\" either synthesizes images that closely resemble the\ninput images or helps extract latent variables. The generative replay strategy\nis flexible to use, can either be incorporated into existing collaborative\nlearning methods to improve their capability of handling data heterogeneity\nacross institutions, or be used as a novel and individual collaborative\nlearning framework (termed FedReplay) to reduce communication cost.\nExperimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in\nhandling heterogeneous data across institutions. On highly heterogeneous data\npartitions, our model achieves ~4.88% improvement in the prediction accuracy on\na diabetic retinopathy classification dataset, and ~49.8% reduction of mean\nabsolution value on a Bone Age prediction dataset, respectively, compared to\nthe state-of-the art collaborative learning methods.",

The current best algorithms for\nsolving dense linear systems reduce the problem to matrix multiplication, and\nrun in time $O(n^{\\omega})$. We consider the problem of finding\n$\\varepsilon$-approximate solutions to linear systems with respect to the\n$L_2$-norm, that is, given a satisfiable linear system $(A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\n\\times n}, b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n)$, find an $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $||Ax -\nb||_2 \\leq \\varepsilon||b||_2$.

In particular, if the best known $O(n^\\omega)$\ntime algorithm for computing the rank of $n \\times O(n)$ matrices is optimal\n(which we conjecture is true), then finding an $\\varepsilon$-approximate\nsolution to a dense linear system also requires $\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^{\\omega})$\ntime, even for $\\varepsilon$ as large as $(1 - 1/\\text{poly}(n))$.

The ability to accurately and efficiently\npredict mood from easily collectible data has several important implications\nfor the early detection, intervention, and treatment of mental health\ndisorders. One promising data source to help monitor human behavior is daily\nsmartphone usage. However, care must be taken to summarize behaviors without\nidentifying the user through personal (e.g., personally identifiable\ninformation) or protected (e.g., race, gender) attributes. In this paper, we\nstudy behavioral markers of daily mood using a recent dataset of mobile\nbehaviors from adolescent populations at high risk of suicidal behaviors. Using\ncomputational models, we find that language and multimodal representations of\nmobile typed text (spanning typed characters, words, keystroke timings, and app\nusage) are predictive of daily mood. However, we find that models trained to\npredict mood often also capture private user identities in their intermediate\nrepresentations. To tackle this problem, we evaluate approaches that obfuscate\nuser identity while remaining predictive.

    "abstract": "Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment camouflaged objects hiding\nin the environment, which is challenging due to the similar appearance of\ncamouflaged objects and their surroundings. Research in biology suggests that\ndepth can provide useful object localization cues for camouflaged object\ndiscovery, as all the animals have 3D perception ability. However, the depth\ninformation has not been exploited for camouflaged object detection. To explore\nthe contribution of depth for camouflage detection, we present a depth-guided\ncamouflaged object detection network with pre-computed depth maps from existing\nmonocular depth estimation methods. Due to the domain gap between the depth\nestimation dataset and our camouflaged object detection dataset, the generated\ndepth may not be accurate enough to be directly used in our framework. We then\nintroduce a depth quality assessment module to evaluate the quality of depth\nbased on the model prediction from both RGB COD branch and RGB-D COD branch.\nDuring training, only high-quality depth is used to update the modal\ninteraction module for multi-modal learning. During testing, our depth quality\nassessment module can effectively determine the contribution of depth and\nselect the RGB branch or RGB-D branch for camouflage prediction.

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are able to reconstruct scenes with\nunprecedented fidelity, and various recent works have extended NeRF to handle\ndynamic scenes. A common approach to reconstruct such non-rigid scenes is\nthrough the use of a learned deformation field mapping from coordinates in each\ninput image into a canonical template coordinate space. However, these\ndeformation-based approaches struggle to model changes in topology, as\ntopological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but these\ndeformation fields are necessarily continuous. We address this limitation by\nlifting NeRFs into a higher dimensional space, and by representing the 5D\nradiance field corresponding to each individual input image as a slice through\nthis \"hyper-space\". Our method is inspired by level set methods, which model\nthe evolution of surfaces as slices through a higher dimensional surface. We\nevaluate our method on two tasks: (i) interpolating smoothly between \"moments\",\ni.e., configurations of the scene, seen in the input images while maintaining\nvisual plausibility, and (ii) novel-view synthesis at fixed moments. We show\nthat our method, which we dub HyperNeRF, outperforms existing methods on both\ntasks by significant margins.

    "abstract": "Clinical predictions using clinical data by computational methods are common\nin bioinformatics. However, clinical predictions using information from\ngenomics datasets as well is not a frequently observed phenomenon in research.\nPrecision medicine research requires information from all available datasets to\nprovide intelligent clinical solutions. In this paper, we have attempted to\ncreate a prediction model which uses information from both clinical and\ngenomics datasets. We have demonstrated multiclass disease predictions based on\ncombined clinical and genomics datasets using machine learning methods. We have\ncreated an integrated dataset, using a clinical (ClinVar) and a genomics (gene\nexpression) dataset, and trained it using instance-based learner to predict\nclinical diseases. We have used an innovative but simple way for multiclass\nclassification, where the number of output classes is as high as 75. We have\nused Principal Component Analysis for feature selection. The classifier\npredicted diseases with 73\\% accuracy on the integrated dataset. The results\nwere consistent and competent when compared with other classification models.\nThe results show that genomics information can be reliably included in datasets\nfor clinical predictions and it can prove to be valuable in clinical\ndiagnostics and precision medicine.",

The neural ODE model for the thermoacoustic system uses time series\nof the heat release rate and the pressure fluctuations, measured simultaneously\nwithout introducing any external perturbations, to model their coupled\ninteraction. Further, we use the parameters of neural ODE to define an anomaly\nmeasure that represents the proximity of system dynamics to limit cycle\noscillations and thus provide an early warning signal for the onset of\nthermoacoustic instability.",

    "abstract": "Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential of utilizing\nnear-term quantum machines to gain certain computational advantages over\nclassical methods. Nevertheless, modern VQAs suffer from cumbersome\ncomputational overhead, hampered by the tradition of employing a solitary\nquantum processor to handle large-volume data. As such, to better exert the\nsuperiority of VQAs, it is of great significance to improve their runtime\nefficiency. Here we devise an efficient distributed optimization scheme, called\nQUDIO, to address this issue. Specifically, in QUDIO, a classical central\nserver partitions the learning problem into multiple subproblems and allocate\nthem to multiple local nodes where each of them consists of a quantum processor\nand a classical optimizer. During the training procedure, all local nodes\nproceed parallel optimization and the classical server synchronizes\noptimization information among local nodes timely. In doing so, we prove a\nsublinear convergence rate of QUDIO in terms of the number of global iteration\nunder the ideal scenario, while the system imperfection may incur divergent\noptimization. Numerical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that QUDIO\ncan surprisingly achieve a superlinear runtime speedup with respect to the\nnumber of local nodes. Our proposal can be readily mixed with other advanced\nVQAs-based techniques to narrow the gap between the state of the art and\napplications with quantum advantage.",

The lack of data in the\nmedical imaging field creates a bottleneck for the application of deep learning\nto medical image analysis. Medical image acquisition, annotation, and analysis\nare costly, and their usage is constrained by ethical restrictions. They also\nrequire many resources, such as human expertise and funding.

    "abstract": "Despite a large body of literature on trip inference using call detail record\n(CDR) data, a fundamental understanding of their limitations is lacking. In\nparticular, because of the sparse nature of CDR data, users may travel to a\nlocation without being revealed in the data, which we refer to as a \"hidden\nvisit\". The existence of hidden visits hinders our ability to extract reliable\ninformation about human mobility and travel behavior from CDR data. In this\nstudy, we propose a data fusion approach to obtain labeled data for statistical\ninference of hidden visits. In the absence of complementary data, this can be\naccomplished by extracting labeled observations from more granular cellular\ndata access records, and extracting features from voice call and text messaging\nrecords. The proposed approach is demonstrated using a real-world CDR dataset\nof 3 million users from a large Chinese city. Logistic regression, support\nvector machine, random forest, and gradient boosting are used to infer whether\na hidden visit exists during a displacement observed from CDR data. The test\nresults show significant improvement over the naive no-hidden-visit rule, which\nis an implicit assumption adopted by most existing studies. Based on the\nproposed model, we estimate that over 10% of the displacements extracted from\nCDR data involve hidden visits. The proposed data fusion method offers a\nsystematic statistical approach to inferring individual mobility patterns based\non telecommunication records.",

So far, this\napproach was constrained to predefined image acquisition intervals and\nsequences of fixed length, which limits its applicability in more realistic\nscenarios. We overcome these limitations by extending Neural Processes, a class\nof conditional generative models for stochastic time series, with a\nhierarchical multi-scale representation encoding including a spatio-temporal\nattention mechanism. The result is a learned growth model that can be\nconditioned on an arbitrary number of observations, and that can produce a\ndistribution of temporally consistent growth trajectories on a continuous time\naxis.

Specifically, our work casts optimization\nas iteratively playing a two-player zero-sum game. Many existing optimization\nalgorithms including Frank-Wolfe and Nesterov's acceleration methods can be\nrecovered from the game by pitting two online learners with appropriate\nstrategies against each other. Furthermore, the sum of the weighted average\nregrets of the players in the game implies the convergence rate. As a result,\nour approach provides simple alternative proofs to these algorithms. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate that our approach of optimization as iteratively playing a game\nleads to three new fast Frank-Wolfe-like algorithms for some constraint sets,\nwhich further shows that our framework is indeed generic, modular, and\neasy-to-use.\nIn the second part, we develop a modular analysis of provable acceleration\nvia Polyak's momentum for certain problems, which include solving the classical\nstrongly quadratic convex problems, training a wide ReLU network under the\nneural tangent kernel regime, and training a deep linear network with an\northogonal initialization. We develop a meta theorem and show that when\napplying Polyak's momentum for these problems, the induced dynamics exhibit a\nform where we can directly apply our meta theorem.\nIn the last part of the dissertation, we show another advantage of the use of\nPolyak's momentum -- it facilitates fast saddle point escape in smooth\nnon-convex optimization. This result, together with those of the second part,\nsheds new light on Polyak's momentum in modern non-convex optimization and deep\nlearning.",

In this work, we present the\nAutoregressive Matrix Product States (AMPS), a tensor-network-based model\ncombining the matrix product states from quantum many-body physics and the\nautoregressive models from machine learning. The model enjoys exact calculation\nof normalized probability and unbiased sampling, as well as a clear theoretical\nunderstanding of expressive power. We demonstrate the performance of our model\nusing two applications, the generative modeling on synthetic and real-world\ndata, and the reinforcement learning in statistical physics. Using extensive\nnumerical experiments, we show that the proposed model significantly\noutperforms the existing tensor-network-based models and the restricted\nBoltzmann machines, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art neural network\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models like Ernie or Bert are currently used in many\napplications. These models come with a set of pre-trained weights typically\nobtained in unsupervised/self-supervised modality on a huge amount of data.\nAfter that, they are fine-tuned on a specific task. Applications then use these\nmodels for inference, and often some additional constraints apply, like low\npower-budget or low latency between input and output. The main avenue to meet\nthese additional requirements for the inference settings, is to use low\nprecision computation (e.g. INT8 rather than FP32), but this comes with a cost\nof deteriorating the functional performance (e.g. accuracy) of the model. Some\napproaches have been developed to tackle the problem and go beyond the\nlimitations of the PTO (Post-Training Quantization), more specifically the QAT\n(Quantization Aware Training, see [4]) is a procedure that interferes with the\ntraining process in order to make it affected (or simply disturbed) by the\nquantization phase during the training itself. Besides QAT, recently\nIntel-Habana Labs have proposed an additional and more direct way to make the\ntraining results more robust to subsequent quantization which uses a\nregularizer, therefore changing the loss function that drives the training\nprocedure. But their proposal does not work out-of-the-box for pre-trained\nmodels like Ernie, for example. In this short paper we show why this is not\nhappening (for the Ernie case) and we propose a very basic way to deal with it,\nsharing as well some initial results (increase in final INT8 accuracy) that\nmight be of interest to practitioners willing to use Ernie in their\napplications, in low precision regime.",

Moreover, they are also expensive in\nterms of computational processing. To address this problem, this research\nproposes a state estimation method for power grids using Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNN).

To quantify the effect of DFA bias, we\nintroduce an approach to rapidly obtain property predictions from 23\nrepresentative DFAs spanning multiple families and \"rungs\" (e.g., semi-local to\ndouble hybrid) and basis sets on over 2,000 TMCs. Although computed properties\n(e.g., spin-state ordering and frontier orbital gap) naturally differ by DFA,\nhigh linear correlations persist across all DFAs. We train independent ML\nmodels for each DFA and observe convergent trends in feature importance; these\nfeatures thus provide DFA-invariant, universal design rules.

    "title": "Q-space Conditioned Translation Networks for Directional Synthesis of  Diffusion Weighted Images from Multi-modal Structural MRI",
    "abstract": "Current deep learning approaches for diffusion MRI modeling circumvent the\nneed for densely-sampled diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) by directly\npredicting microstructural indices from sparsely-sampled DWIs. However, they\nimplicitly make unrealistic assumptions of static $q$-space sampling during\ntraining and reconstruction. Further, such approaches can restrict downstream\nusage of variably sampled DWIs for usages including the estimation of\nmicrostructural indices or tractography. We propose a generative adversarial\ntranslation framework for high-quality DWI synthesis with arbitrary $q$-space\nsampling given commonly acquired structural images (e.g., B0, T1, T2). Our\ntranslation network linearly modulates its internal representations conditioned\non continuous $q$-space information, thus removing the need for fixed sampling\nschemes. Moreover, this approach enables downstream estimation of high-quality\nmicrostructural maps from arbitrarily subsampled DWIs, which may be\nparticularly important in cases with sparsely sampled DWIs. Across several\nrecent methodologies, the proposed approach yields improved DWI synthesis\naccuracy and fidelity with enhanced downstream utility as quantified by the\naccuracy of scalar microstructure indices estimated from the synthesized\nimages.

    "abstract": "This paper describes a new library for learning Bayesian networks from data\ncontaining discrete and continuous variables (mixed data). In addition to the\nclassical learning methods on discretized data, this library proposes its\nalgorithm that allows structural learning and parameters learning from mixed\ndata without discretization since data discretization leads to information\nloss. This algorithm based on mixed MI score function for structural learning,\nand also linear regression and Gaussian distribution approximation for\nparameters learning. The library also offers two algorithms for enumerating\ngraph structures - the greedy Hill-Climbing algorithm and the evolutionary\nalgorithm. Thus the key capabilities of the proposed library are as follows:\n(1) structural and parameters learning of a Bayesian network on discretized\ndata, (2) structural and parameters learning of a Bayesian network on mixed\ndata using the MI mixed score function and Gaussian approximation, (3)\nlaunching learning algorithms on one of two algorithms for enumerating graph\nstructures - Hill-Climbing and the evolutionary algorithm. Since the need for\nmixed data representation comes from practical necessity, the advantages of our\nimplementations are evaluated in the context of solving approximation and gap\nrecovery problems on synthetic data and real datasets.",

    "abstract": "Warming oceans due to climate change are leading to increased numbers of\nectoparasitic copepods, also known as sea lice, which can cause significant\necological loss to wild salmon populations and major economic loss to\naquaculture sites. The main transport mechanism driving the spread of sea lice\npopulations are near-surface ocean currents. Present strategies to estimate the\ndistribution of sea lice larvae are computationally complex and limit\nfull-scale analysis. Motivated to address this challenge, we propose SALT: Sea\nlice Adaptive Lattice Tracking approach for efficient estimation of sea lice\ndispersion and distribution in space and time. Specifically, an adaptive\nspatial mesh is generated by merging nodes in the lattice graph of the Ocean\nModel based on local ocean properties, thus enabling highly efficient graph\nrepresentation. SALT demonstrates improved efficiency while maintaining\nconsistent results with the standard method, using near-surface current data\nfor Hardangerfjord, Norway. The proposed SALT technique shows promise for\nenhancing proactive aquaculture management through predictive modelling of sea\nlice infestation pressure maps in a changing climate.",
