    "title": "XL-Sum: Large-Scale Multilingual Abstractive Summarization for 44  Languages",
    "abstract": "Contemporary works on abstractive text summarization have focused primarily\non high-resource languages like English, mostly due to the limited availability\nof datasets for low/mid-resource ones. In this work, we present XL-Sum, a\ncomprehensive and diverse dataset comprising 1 million professionally annotated\narticle-summary pairs from BBC, extracted using a set of carefully designed\nheuristics. The dataset covers 44 languages ranging from low to high-resource,\nfor many of which no public dataset is currently available. XL-Sum is highly\nabstractive, concise, and of high quality, as indicated by human and intrinsic\nevaluation. We fine-tune mT5, a state-of-the-art pretrained multilingual model,\nwith XL-Sum and experiment on multilingual and low-resource summarization\ntasks. XL-Sum induces competitive results compared to the ones obtained using\nsimilar monolingual datasets: we show higher than 11 ROUGE-2 scores on 10\nlanguages we benchmark on, with some of them exceeding 15, as obtained by\nmultilingual training. Additionally, training on low-resource languages\nindividually also provides competitive performance. To the best of our\nknowledge, XL-Sum is the largest abstractive summarization dataset in terms of\nthe number of samples collected from a single source and the number of\nlanguages covered. We are releasing our dataset and models to encourage future\nresearch on multilingual abstractive summarization. The resources can be found\nat \\url{https://github.com/csebuetnlp/xl-sum}.",

    "abstract": "Encodings of term rewriting systems (TRSs) into graph rewriting systems\nusually lose global termination, meaning the encodings do not terminate on all\ngraphs. A typical encoding of the terminating TRS rule a(b(x)) -> b(a(x)), for\nexample, may be indefinitely applicable along a cycle of a's and b's. Recently,\nwe introduced PBPO+, a graph rewriting formalism in which rules employ a type\ngraph to specify transformations and control rule applicability. In the present\npaper, we show that PBPO+ allows for a natural encoding of linear TRS rules\nthat preserves termination globally. This result is a step towards modeling\nother rewriting formalisms, such as lambda calculus and higher order rewriting,\nusing graph rewriting in a way that preserves properties like termination and\nconfluence. We moreover expect that the encoding can serve as a guide for\nlifting TRS termination methods to PBPO+ rewriting.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative inference enables resource-constrained edge devices to make\ninferences by uploading inputs (e.g., images) to a server (i.e., cloud) where\nthe heavy deep learning models run. While this setup works cost-effectively for\nsuccessful inferences, it severely underperforms when the model faces input\nsamples on which the model was not trained (known as Out-of-Distribution (OOD)\nsamples). If the edge devices could, at least, detect that an input sample is\nan OOD, that could potentially save communication and computation resources by\nnot uploading those inputs to the server for inference workload. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel lightweight OOD detection approach that mines important\nfeatures from the shallow layers of a pretrained CNN model and detects an input\nsample as ID (In-Distribution) or OOD based on a distance function defined on\nthe reduced feature space. Our technique (a) works on pretrained models without\nany retraining of those models, and (b) does not expose itself to any OOD\ndataset (all detection parameters are obtained from the ID training dataset).\nTo this end, we develop EARLIN (EARLy OOD detection for Collaborative\nINference) that takes a pretrained model and partitions the model at the OOD\ndetection layer and deploys the considerably small OOD part on an edge device\nand the rest on the cloud. By experimenting using real datasets and a prototype\nimplementation, we show that our technique achieves better results than other\napproaches in terms of overall accuracy and cost when tested against popular\nOOD datasets on top of popular deep learning models pretrained on benchmark\ndatasets.",

We present ongoing work on a logical\nframework with a meta-language based on graphs. A simpler meta-language leads\nto a shallower embedding of the object language, but hopefully leads to easier\nimplementation and usage. A graph-based logical framework also opens up\ninteresting possibilities in time and space performance by using heavily\noptimized graph databases as backends and by proof compression algorithms\ngeared towards graphs. Deductive systems can be specified using simple\ndomain-specific languages built on top of the graph database's query language.\nThere is support for interactive (through a web-based interface) and\nsemiautomatic (following user-defined tactics specified by a domain-specific\nlanguage) proof modes.

This is an important case of the general problem of extracting a PN\nfrom a TS.

We in this work propose to\nautomate multiple such steps end-to-end, by synthesizing complex data pipelines\nwith both string transformations and table-manipulation operators. We propose a\nnovel \"by-target\" paradigm that allows users to easily specify the desired\npipeline, which is a significant departure from the traditional by-example\nparadigm. Using by-target, users would provide input tables (e.g., csv or json\nfiles), and point us to a \"target table\" (e.g., an existing database table or\nBI dashboard) to demonstrate how the output from the desired pipeline would\nschematically \"look like\". While the problem is seemingly underspecified, our\nunique insight is that implicit table constraints such as FDs and keys can be\nexploited to significantly constrain the space to make the problem tractable.\nWe develop an Auto-Pipeline system that learns to synthesize pipelines using\nreinforcement learning and search.

In the swallow-level stage, three\nmodels based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed to predict\nswallow type, swallow pressurization, and integrated relaxation pressure (IRP).\nAt the study-level stage, model selection from families of the\nexpert-knowledge-based rule models, xgboost models and artificial neural\nnetwork(ANN) models were conducted, with the latter two model designed and\naugmented with motivation from the export knowledge. A simple model-agnostic\nstrategy of model balancing motivated by Bayesian principles was utilized,\nwhich gave rise to model averaging weighted by precision scores. The averaged\n(blended) models and individual models were compared and evaluated, of which\nthe best performance on test dataset is 0.81 in top-1 prediction, 0.92 in top-2\npredictions. This is the first artificial-intelligence-style model to\nautomatically predict CC diagnosis of HRM study from raw multi-swallow data.\nMoreover, the proposed modeling framework could be easily extended to\nmulti-modal tasks, such as diagnosis of esophageal patients based on clinical\ndata from both HRM and functional luminal imaging probe panometry (FLIP).",

    "abstract": "We propose a method to estimate the uncertainty of the outcome of an image\nclassifier on a given input datum. Deep neural networks commonly used for image\nclassification are deterministic maps from an input image to an output class.\nAs such, their outcome on a given datum involves no uncertainty, so we must\nspecify what variability we are referring to when defining, measuring and\ninterpreting \"confidence.\" To this end, we introduce the Wellington Posterior,\nwhich is the distribution of outcomes that would have been obtained in response\nto data that could have been generated by the same scene that produced the\ngiven image. Since there are infinitely many scenes that could have generated\nthe given image, the Wellington Posterior requires induction from scenes other\nthan the one portrayed. We explore alternate methods using data augmentation,\nensembling, and model linearization. Additional alternatives include generative\nadversarial networks, conditional prior networks, and supervised single-view\nreconstruction. We test these alternatives against the empirical posterior\nobtained by inferring the class of temporally adjacent frames in a video. These\ndevelopments are only a small step towards assessing the reliability of deep\nnetwork classifiers in a manner that is compatible with safety-critical\napplications.",

Numerical results illustrate that the proposed\nalgorithms can deliver up to two times the speedup compared with that of\nclassical Revolve.

HSM uses the spectral space of ultrashort laser pulses to\ncreate line codes in the form of 2D holograms. The pulse processing is\nperformed in the temporal Fourier domain by spatially dispersing the pulse\nfrequency components in a spectral processing device (SPD). The 2D holograms\nare composed of the patterns of intensity disparities that an SLM inscribes on\nthe spectrally-decomposed Fourier plane of the pulse. The holographic line\ncodes defined in this way transform the ultrashort laser pulses into\nhigh-entropy data symbols, hence, enhance the communication's spectral\nefficiency. Unlike conventional optical multiplexing schemes (e.g., TDM, WDM,\nor SDM), HSM does not physically or abstractly separate the communication\npropagation space into subchannels. Rather, HSM realizes a MIMO communication\nparadigm by allowing the photonic waves under the pulse envelope to propagate\nin the same space so they scatter and interfere by chromatic dispersion. This\nallows HSM to form beams between the pixels of SLM at the sender and receiver\nsides and optimize the beam to adapt to channel scattering situations. In this\nway, HSM delivers a rate gain that in the best case exponentially increases the\ninformation rate of communication.",

Our analysis reveals that this goal can\nbe accomplished by utilizing the right optimization method that replicates the\nimplicit regularization effect of SGD, leading to gradient alignment as well as\nimprovements in test accuracies. Since the existence of this regularization in\nSGD completely relies on the sequential use of different mini-batches during\ntraining, it is inherently absent when training with large mini-batches.

Domain adaptation approaches thus appeared as a useful\nframework yielding extra flexibility in that distinct train and test data\ndistributions are supported, provided that other assumptions are satisfied such\nas covariate shift, which expects the conditional distributions over labels to\nbe independent of the underlying data distribution. Several approaches were\nintroduced in order to induce generalization across varying train and test data\nsources, and those often rely on the general idea of domain-invariance, in such\na way that the data-generating distributions are to be disregarded by the\nprediction model. In this contribution, we tackle the problem of generalizing\nacross data sources by approaching it from the opposite direction: we consider\na conditional modeling approach in which predictions, in addition to being\ndependent on the input data, use information relative to the underlying\ndata-generating distribution. For instance, the model has an explicit mechanism\nto adapt to changing environments and/or new data sources. We argue that such\nan approach is more generally applicable than current domain adaptation methods\nsince it does not require extra assumptions such as covariate shift and further\nyields simpler training algorithms that avoid a common source of training\ninstabilities caused by minimax formulations, often employed in\ndomain-invariant methods.",

    "abstract": "Context: Refactoring is the art of modifying the design of a system without\naltering its behavior. The idea is to reorganize variables, classes and methods\nto facilitate their future adaptations and comprehension. As the concept of\nbehavior preservation is fundamental for refactoring, several studies, using\nformal verification, language transformation and dynamic analysis, have been\nproposed to monitor the execution of refactoring operations and their impact on\nthe program semantics. However, there is no existing study that examines the\navailable behavior preservation strategies for each refactoring operation.\nObjective: This paper identifies behavior preservation approaches in the\nresearch literature.\nMethod: We conduct, in this paper, a systematic mapping study, to capture all\nexisting behavior preservation approaches that we classify based on several\ncriteria including their methodology, applicability, and their degree of\nautomation.\nResults: The results indicate that several behavior preservation approaches\nhave been proposed in the literature. The approaches vary between using\nformalisms and techniques, developing automatic refactoring safety tools, and\nperforming a manual analysis of the source code.\nConclusion: Our taxonomy reveals that there exist some types of refactoring\noperations whose behavior preservation is under-researched. Our classification\nalso indicates that several possible strategies can be combined to better\ndetect any violation of the program semantics.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increased emphasis on understanding and\nmitigating adverse impacts of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies on\nsociety. Across academia, industry, and government bodies, a variety of\nendeavours are being pursued towards enhancing AI ethics. A significant\nchallenge in the design of ethical AI systems is that there are multiple\nstakeholders in the AI pipeline, each with their own set of constraints and\ninterests. These different perspectives are often not understood, due in part\nto communication gaps.For example, AI researchers who design and develop AI\nmodels are not necessarily aware of the instability induced in consumers' lives\nby the compounded effects of AI decisions. Educating different stakeholders\nabout their roles and responsibilities in the broader context becomes\nnecessary. In this position paper, we outline some potential ways in which\ngenerative artworks can play this role by serving as accessible and powerful\neducational tools for surfacing different perspectives. We hope to spark\ninterdisciplinary discussions about computational creativity broadly as a tool\nfor enhancing AI ethics.",

Recent approaches automatically generate a reward\nfunction from a given specification and use a suitable reinforcement learning\nalgorithm to learn a policy that maximizes the expected reward.

In this work, we develop a compositional learning approach, called\nDiRL, that interleaves high-level planning and reinforcement learning. First,\nDiRL encodes the specification as an abstract graph; intuitively, vertices and\nedges of the graph correspond to regions of the state space and simpler\nsub-tasks, respectively. Our approach then incorporates reinforcement learning\nto learn neural network policies for each edge (sub-task) within a\nDijkstra-style planning algorithm to compute a high-level plan in the graph.

    "abstract": "Training large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs) currently requires a\nsignificant amount of energy, leading to serious environmental impacts. One\npromising approach to reduce the energy costs is representing DNNs with\nlow-precision numbers. While it is common to train DNNs with forward and\nbackward propagation in low-precision, training directly over low-precision\nweights, without keeping a copy of weights in high-precision, still remains to\nbe an unsolved problem. This is due to complex interactions between learning\nalgorithms and low-precision number systems. To address this, we jointly design\na low-precision training framework involving a logarithmic number system (LNS)\nand a multiplicative weight update training method, termed LNS-Madam. LNS has a\nhigh dynamic range even in a low-bitwidth setting, leading to high energy\nefficiency and making it relevant for on-board training in energy-constrained\nedge devices. We design LNS to have the flexibility of choosing different bases\nfor weights and gradients, as they usually require different quantization gaps\nand dynamic ranges during training. By drawing the connection between LNS and\nmultiplicative update, LNS-Madam ensures low quantization error during weight\nupdate, leading to a stable convergence even if the bitwidth is limited.\nCompared to using a fixed-point or floating-point number system and training\nwith popular learning algorithms such as SGD and Adam, our joint design with\nLNS and LNS-Madam optimizer achieves better accuracy while requiring smaller\nbitwidth. Notably, with only 5-bit for gradients, the proposed training\nframework achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision state-of-the-art\nmodels such as ResNet-50 and BERT. After conducting energy estimations by\nanalyzing the math datapath units during training, the results show that our\ndesign achieves over 60x energy reduction compared to FP32 on BERT models.",

Simply storing an indicator\ntensor for all relationships is already intractable for moderately sized $n$,\nprompting previous approaches to restrict the number of vertices a hyperedge\nconnects.

We leverage the property that most hypergraphs of interest are\nsparsely connected and reduce the memory requirement to $\\mathcal{O}(nk)$,\nwhere $k$ is the maximum number of positive edges, i.e., edges that actually\nexist. In order to counteract the linearly growing memory cost from training a\nlengthening sequence of refinement steps, we further propose an algorithm that\napplies backpropagation through time on randomly sampled subsequences.

One problem of Gram matrix-based\noptimization is that it does not consider the correlation between colors and\ntheir styles. Specifically, certain textures or structures should be associated\nwith specific colors. This is particularly challenging when the target style\nimage exhibits multiple style types.

Apart from the traditional\ncode completion methods, which only support single token completion at minimal\npositions, recent studies show the ability to provide longer code completion at\nmore flexible positions. However, such frequently triggered and longer\ncompletion results reduce the overall precision as they generate more invalid\nresults. Moreover, different studies are mostly incompatible with each other.\nThus, it is vital to develop an ensemble framework that can combine results\nfrom multiple models to draw merits and offset defects of each model.\nThis paper conducts a coding simulation to collect data from code context and\ndifferent code completion models and then apply the data in two tasks. First,\nwe introduce an acceptance model which can dynamically control whether to\ndisplay completion results to the developer. It uses simulation features to\npredict whether correct results exist in the output of these models. Our best\nmodel reduces the percentage of false-positive completion from 55.09% to\n17.44%. Second, we design a fusion ranking scheme that can automatically\nidentify the priority of the completion results and reorder the candidates from\nmultiple code completion models. This scheme is flexible in dealing with\nvarious models, regardless of the type or the length of their completion\nresults. We integrate this ranking scheme with two frequency models and a GPT-2\nstyled language model, along with the acceptance model to yield 27.80% and\n37.64% increase in TOP1 and TOP5 accuracy, respectively.

    "title": "Dual-Stream Reciprocal Disentanglement Learning for Domain Adaption  Person Re-Identification",
    "abstract": "Since human-labeled samples are free for the target set, unsupervised person\nre-identification (Re-ID) has attracted much attention in recent years, by\nadditionally exploiting the source set. However, due to the differences on\ncamera styles, illumination and backgrounds, there exists a large gap between\nsource domain and target domain, introducing a great challenge on cross-domain\nmatching. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a novel method named\nDual-stream Reciprocal Disentanglement Learning (DRDL), which is quite\nefficient in learning domain-invariant features. In DRDL, two encoders are\nfirst constructed for id-related and id-unrelated feature extractions, which\nare respectively measured by their associated classifiers. Furthermore,\nfollowed by an adversarial learning strategy, both streams reciprocally and\npositively effect each other, so that the id-related features and id-unrelated\nfeatures are completely disentangled from a given image, allowing the encoder\nto be powerful enough to obtain the discriminative but domain-invariant\nfeatures. In contrast to existing approaches, our proposed method is free from\nimage generation, which not only reduces the computational complexity\nremarkably, but also removes redundant information from id-related features.\nExtensive experiments substantiate the superiority of our proposed method\ncompared with the state-of-the-arts. The source code has been released in\nhttps://github.com/lhf12278/DRDL.",

Despite their impressive\nperformance, object detectors suffer from a lack of interpretability.\nVisualization techniques have been developed and widely applied to introspect\nthe decisions made by other kinds of deep learning models; however, visualizing\nobject detectors has been underexplored. In this paper, we propose using\ninversion as a primary tool to understand modern object detectors and develop\nan optimization-based approach to layout inversion, allowing us to generate\nsynthetic images recognized by trained detectors as containing a desired\nconfiguration of objects. We reveal intriguing properties of detectors by\napplying our layout inversion technique to a variety of modern object\ndetectors, and further investigate them via validation experiments: they rely\non qualitatively different features for classification and regression; they\nlearn canonical motifs of commonly co-occurring objects; they use diff erent\nvisual cues to recognize objects of varying sizes.

    "title": "Partial Strong Structural Controllability",
    "abstract": "In linear control theory, a structured system is a system whose entries of\nits system matrices are either fixed zero or indeterminate. This system is\nstructurally controllable, if there exists a realization of it that is\ncontrollable, and is strongly structurally controllable (SSC), if for any\nnonzero values of the indeterminate entries, the corresponding system is\ncontrollable. This paper introduces a new controllability notion, termed\npartial strong structural controllability (PSSC), which naturally extends SSC\nand bridges the gap between structural controllability and SSC. Dividing the\nindeterminate entries into two categories, generic entries and unspecified\nentries, a system is PSSC, if for almost all values of the generic entries in\nthe parameter space except for a set of measure zero, and any nonzero (complex)\nvalues of the unspecified entries, the corresponding system is controllable. We\nhighlight that this notion generalizes the generic property embedded in the\nconventional structural controllability for single-input systems. We then give\nalgebraic and (bipartite) graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor single-input systems to be PSSC. Conditions for multi-input systems are\nsubsequently given for a particular case. We also extend our results to the\ncase where the unspecified entries can take either nonzero values or\nzero/nonzero values. Finally, we show the established results can induce a new\ngraph-theoretic criterion for SSC in maximum matchings over the system\nbipartite graph representations.",

However, the\ndesign of robot skills can often be intractable in real-world applications due\nto the prohibitive amount of effort and expertise that it requires. In this\nwork, we introduce Skill Learning In Diversified Environments (SLIDE), a method\nto discover generalizable skills via automated generation of a diverse set of\ntasks. As opposed to prior work on unsupervised discovery of skills which\nincentivizes the skills to produce different outcomes in the same environment,\nour method pairs each skill with a unique task produced by a trainable task\ngenerator. To encourage generalizable skills to emerge, our method trains each\nskill to specialize in the paired task and maximizes the diversity of the\ngenerated tasks. A task discriminator defined on the robot behaviors in the\ngenerated tasks is jointly trained to estimate the evidence lower bound of the\ndiversity objective. The learned skills can then be composed in a hierarchical\nreinforcement learning algorithm to solve unseen target tasks. We demonstrate\nthat the proposed method can effectively learn a variety of robot skills in two\ntabletop manipulation domains.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel adaptive smooth disturbance observer-based fast\nfinite-time adaptive backstepping control scheme is presented for the attitude\ntracking of the 3-DOF helicopter system subject to compound disturbances.\nFirst, an adaptive smooth disturbance observer (ASDO) is proposed to estimate\nthe composite disturbance, which owns the characteristics of smooth output,\nfast finite-time convergence, and adaptability to the disturbance of unknown\nderivative boundary. Then, a finite-time backstepping control protocol is\nconstruct to drive the elevation and pitch angles to track reference\ntrajectories. To tackle the \"explosion of complexity\" and \"singularity\"\nproblems in the conventional backstepping design framework, a fast finite-time\ncommand filter (FFTCF) is utilized to estimate the virtual control signal and\nits derivative. Moreover, a fractional power-based auxiliary dynamic system is\nintroduced to compensate the error caused by the FFTCF estimation. Furthermore,\nan improved fractional power-based adaptive law with the $\\sigma $-modification\nterm is designed to attenuate the observer approximation error, such that the\ntracking performance is further enhanced. In terms of the fast finite-time\nstability theory, the signals of the closed-loop system are all fast\nfinite-time bounded while the attitude tracking errors can fast converge to a\nsufficiently small region of the origin in finite time.

    "abstract": "The common practice of quality monitoring in industry relies on manual\ninspection well-known to be slow, error-prone and operator-dependent. This\nissue raises strong demand for automated real-time quality monitoring developed\nfrom data-driven approaches thus alleviating from operator dependence and\nadapting to various process uncertainties. Nonetheless, current approaches do\nnot take into account the streaming nature of sensory information while relying\nheavily on hand-crafted features making them application-specific. This paper\nproposes the online quality monitoring methodology developed from recently\ndeveloped deep learning algorithms for data streams, Neural Networks with\nDynamically Evolved Capacity (NADINE), namely NADINE++. It features the\nintegration of 1-D and 2-D convolutional layers to extract natural features of\ntime-series and visual data streams captured from sensors and cameras of the\ninjection molding machines from our own project. Real-time experiments have\nbeen conducted where the online quality monitoring task is simulated on the fly\nunder the prequential test-then-train fashion - the prominent data stream\nevaluation protocol. Comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques clearly\nexhibits the advantage of NADINE++ with 4.68\\% improvement on average for the\nquality monitoring task in streaming environments. To support the reproducible\nresearch initiative, codes, results of NADINE++ along with supplementary\nmaterials and injection molding dataset are made available in\n\\url{https://github.com/ContinualAL/NADINE-IJCNN2021}.",

Solar energy\nis one of the most significant contributors to renewable energy and is\ndependent on solar irradiation. For the effective management of electrical\npower grids, forecasting models that predict solar irradiation, with high\naccuracy, are needed.

The framework starts with semantic\nsegmentation of the point cloud, which is initially projected onto a spherical\nsurface. The same semantic segmentation is applied to the corresponding camera\nimage. Next, our new conditional generative model adversarially learns to\ntranslate the predicted LiDAR segment maps to the camera image counterparts.\nFinally, generated image segments are processed to render the panoramic scene\nimages.

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with distributed detection of central nodes in\ncomplex networks using closeness centrality. Closeness centrality plays an\nessential role in network analysis. Evaluating closeness centrality exactly\nrequires complete knowledge of the network; for large networks, this may be\ninefficient, so closeness centrality should be approximated. Distributed tasks\nsuch as leader election can make effective use of centrality information for\nhighly central nodes, but complete network information is not locally\navailable. This paper refines a distributed centrality computation algorithm by\nYou et al. [24] by pruning nodes which are almost certainly not most central.\nFor example, in a large network, leave nodes can not play a central role. This\nleads to a reduction in the number of messages exchanged to determine the\ncentrality of the remaining nodes. Our results show that our approach reduces\nthe number of messages for networks which contain many prunable nodes. Our\nresults also show that reducing the number of messages may",

Though effective, their\nrepresentation expressiveness is still hindered by the sparse learning signals.\nAs a result, the sequential recommender is prone to make inconsistent\npredictions. In this paper, we propose a model, \\textbf{SSI}, to improve\nsequential recommendation consistency with Self-Supervised Imitation.\nPrecisely, we extract the consistency knowledge by utilizing three\nself-supervised pre-training tasks, where temporal consistency and persona\nconsistency capture user-interaction dynamics in terms of the chronological\norder and persona sensitivities, respectively. Furthermore, to provide the\nmodel with a global perspective, global session consistency is introduced by\nmaximizing the mutual information among global and local interaction sequences.\nFinally, to comprehensively take advantage of all three independent aspects of\nconsistency-enhanced knowledge, we establish an integrated imitation learning\nframework. The consistency knowledge is effectively internalized and\ntransferred to the student model by imitating the conventional prediction logit\nas well as the consistency-enhanced item representations. In addition, the\nflexible self-supervised imitation framework can also benefit other student\nrecommenders.

In this paper,\nwe propose an alternative query engine, called gSmart, based on matrix algebra.\nThis approach can potentially better exploit the computing power of\nhigh-performance heterogeneous architectures that we target. gSmart\nincorporates: (1) grouped incident edge-based SPARQL query evaluation, in which\nall unevaluated edges of a vertex are evaluated together using a series of\nmatrix operations to fully utilize query constraints and narrow down the\nsolution space; (2) a graph query planner that determines the order in which\nvertices in query graphs should be evaluated; (3) memory- and\ncomputation-efficient data structures including the light-weight sparse matrix\n(LSpM) storage for RDF data and the tree-based representation for evaluation\nresults; (4) a multi-stage data partitioner to map the incident edge-based\nquery evaluation into heterogeneous HPC architectures and develop multi-level\nparallelism; and (5) a parallel executor that uses the fine-grained processing\nscheme, pre-pruning technique, and tree-pruning technique to lower inter-node\ncommunication and enable high throughput. Evaluations of gSmart on a CPU+GPU\nHPC architecture show execution time speedups of up to 46920.00x compared to\nthe existing SPARQL query engines on a single node machine.

    "title": "Vision-driven Compliant Manipulation for Reliable, High-Precision  Assembly Tasks",
    "abstract": "Highly constrained manipulation tasks continue to be challenging for\nautonomous robots as they require high levels of precision, typically less than\n1mm, which is often incompatible with what can be achieved by traditional\nperception systems. This paper demonstrates that the combination of\nstate-of-the-art object tracking with passively adaptive mechanical hardware\ncan be leveraged to complete precision manipulation tasks with tight,\nindustrially-relevant tolerances (0.25mm). The proposed control method closes\nthe loop through vision by tracking the relative 6D pose of objects in the\nrelevant workspace. It adjusts the control reference of both the compliant\nmanipulator and the hand to complete object insertion tasks via within-hand\nmanipulation. Contrary to previous efforts for insertion, our method does not\nrequire expensive force sensors, precision manipulators, or time-consuming,\nonline learning, which is data hungry. Instead, this effort leverages\nmechanical compliance and utilizes an object agnostic manipulation model of the\nhand learned offline, off-the-shelf motion planning, and an RGBD-based object\ntracker trained solely with synthetic data. These features allow the proposed\nsystem to easily generalize and transfer to new tasks and environments. This\npaper describes in detail the system components and showcases its efficacy with\nextensive experiments involving tight tolerance peg-in-hole insertion tasks of\nvarious geometries as well as open-world constrained placement tasks.",

Interflow weights and\nfuses the features learned in both shallower and deeper layers, making the\nfeature information at each stage processed reasonably and effectively,\nenabling the middle layers to learn more distinguished features, and enhancing\nthe model representation ability. In addition, Interflow can alleviate gradient\nvanishing problem, lower the difficulty of network depth selection, and lighten\npossible over-fitting problem by introducing attention mechanism. Besides, it\ncan avoid network degradation as a byproduct. Compared with the original model,\nthe CNN model with Interflow achieves higher test accuracy on multiple\nbenchmark datasets.",

Here, we propose an $opinion$-$free$ BIQA method\nthat learns from synthetically-distorted images and multiple agents to assess\nthe perceptual quality of authentically-distorted ones captured in the wild\nwithout relying on human labels. Specifically, we first assemble a large number\nof image pairs from synthetically-distorted images and use a set of\nfull-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) models to assign pseudo-binary\nlabels of each pair indicating which image has higher quality as the\nsupervisory signal. We then train a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\nBIQA model to rank the perceptual quality, optimized for consistency with the\nbinary labels. Since there exists domain shift between the synthetically- and\nauthentically-distorted images, an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) module\nis introduced to alleviate this issue.

For the task of\nclassification, techniques such as meta-learning, zero-shot learning, and\nfew-shot learning showcase the ability to learn information about novel classes\nbased on prior knowledge. Recent techniques try to learn a cross-modal mapping\nbetween the semantic space and the image space. However, they tend to ignore\nthe local and global semantic knowledge. To overcome this problem, we propose a\nMultimodal Variational Auto-Encoder (M-VAE) which can learn the shared latent\nspace of image features and the semantic space. In our approach we concatenate\nmultimodal data to a single embedding before passing it to the VAE for learning\nthe latent space.

Our approach is\ncapable to correlating modalities and exploit the local and global semantic\nknowledge for novel sample predictions.

First, we give a much simpler algorithm to\nconstruct piecewise-linear morphs between planar straight-line graphs.\nSpecifically, given isomorphic straight-line drawings $\\Gamma_0$ and $\\Gamma_1$\nof the same 3-connected planar graph $G$, with the same convex outer face, we\nconstruct a morph from $\\Gamma_0$ to $\\Gamma_1$ that consists of $O(n)$\nunidirectional morphing steps, in $O(n^{1+\\omega/2})$ time. Our algorithm\nentirely avoids the classical edge-collapsing strategy dating back to Cairns;\ninstead, in each morphing step, we interpolate the pair of weights associated\nwith a single edge. Second, we describe a natural extension of barycentric\ninterpolation to geodesic graphs on the flat torus. Barycentric interpolation\ncannot be applied directly in this setting, because the linear systems defining\nintermediate vertex positions are not necessarily solvable. We describe a\nsimple scaling strategy that circumvents this issue. Computing the appropriate\nscaling requires $O(n^{\\omega/2})$ time, after which we can can compute the\ndrawing at any point in the morph in $O(n^{\\omega/2})$ time. Our algorithm is\nconsiderably simpler than the recent algorithm of Chambers et al.\n(arXiv:2007.07927) and produces more natural morphs.

    "abstract": "Automotive traffic scenes are complex due to the variety of possible\nscenarios, objects, and weather conditions that need to be handled. In contrast\nto more constrained environments, such as automated underground trains,\nautomotive perception systems cannot be tailored to a narrow field of specific\ntasks but must handle an ever-changing environment with unforeseen events. As\ncurrently no single sensor is able to reliably perceive all relevant activity\nin the surroundings, sensor data fusion is applied to perceive as much\ninformation as possible. Data fusion of different sensors and sensor modalities\non a low abstraction level enables the compensation of sensor weaknesses and\nmisdetections among the sensors before the information-rich sensor data are\ncompressed and thereby information is lost after a sensor-individual object\ndetection. This paper develops a low-level sensor fusion network for 3D object\ndetection, which fuses lidar, camera, and radar data. The fusion network is\ntrained and evaluated on the nuScenes data set. On the test set, fusion of\nradar data increases the resulting AP (Average Precision) detection score by\nabout 5.1% in comparison to the baseline lidar network. The radar sensor fusion\nproves especially beneficial in inclement conditions such as rain and night\nscenes. Fusing additional camera data contributes positively only in\nconjunction with the radar fusion, which shows that interdependencies of the\nsensors are important for the detection result. Additionally, the paper\nproposes a novel loss to handle the discontinuity of a simple yaw\nrepresentation for object detection.

    "abstract": "We propose a new perspective on video understanding by casting the video\nrecognition problem as an image recognition task. We show that an image\nclassifier alone can suffice for video understanding without temporal modeling.\nOur approach is simple and universal. It composes input frames into a super\nimage to train an image classifier to fulfill the task of action recognition,\nin exactly the same way as classifying an image. We prove the viability of such\nan idea by demonstrating strong and promising performance on four public\ndatasets including Kinetics400, Something-to-something (V2), MiT and Jester,\nusing a recently developed vision transformer. We also experiment with the\nprevalent ResNet image classifiers in computer vision to further validate our\nidea. The results on Kinetics400 are comparable to some of the best-performed\nCNN approaches based on spatio-temporal modeling. our code and models will be\nmade available at https://github.com/IBM/sifar-pytorch.",

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised\nTime-Series representation learning framework via Temporal and Contextual\nContrasting (TS-TCC), to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data.\nFirst, the raw time-series data are transformed into two different yet\ncorrelated views by using weak and strong augmentations. Second, we propose a\nnovel temporal contrasting module to learn robust temporal representations by\ndesigning a tough cross-view prediction task. Last, to further learn\ndiscriminative representations, we propose a contextual contrasting module\nbuilt upon the contexts from the temporal contrasting module. It attempts to\nmaximize the similarity among different contexts of the same sample while\nminimizing similarity among contexts of different samples. Experiments have\nbeen carried out on three real-world time-series datasets. The results manifest\nthat training a linear classifier on top of the features learned by our\nproposed TS-TCC performs comparably with the supervised training.

To address the two performance limitations, we consider in this\npaper an MEC-enabled IoT system with an energy harvesting (EH) wireless device\n(WD) which opportunistically accesses the licensed spectrum of an overlaid\nprimary communication link for task offloading. We aim to maximize the\nlong-term average sensing rate of the WD subject to quality of service (QoS)\nrequirement of primary link, average power constraint of MEC server (MS) and\ndata queue stability of both MS and WD.

    "abstract": "The past few years have witnessed great progress in the domain of face\nrecognition thanks to advances in deep learning. However, cross pose face\nrecognition remains a significant challenge. It is difficult for many deep\nlearning algorithms to narrow the performance gap caused by pose variations;\nthe main reasons for this relate to the intra-class discrepancy between face\nimages in different poses and the pose imbalances of training datasets.\nLearning pose-robust features by traversing to the feature space of frontal\nfaces provides an effective and cheap way to alleviate this problem. In this\npaper, we present a method for progressively transforming profile face\nrepresentations to the canonical pose with an attentive pair-wise loss.\nFirstly, to reduce the difficulty of directly transforming the profile face\nfeatures into a frontal pose, we propose to learn the feature residual between\nthe source pose and its nearby pose in a block-byblock fashion, and thus\ntraversing to the feature space of a smaller pose by adding the learned\nresidual. Secondly, we propose an attentive pair-wise loss to guide the feature\ntransformation progressing in the most effective direction. Finally, our\nproposed progressive module and attentive pair-wise loss are light-weight and\neasy to implement, adding only about 7:5% extra parameters.

Meanwhile, AdaptCL provides a\nmechanism for handling the trade-off between accuracy and time overhead and can\nbe combined with other techniques to accelerate training further. Empirical\nresults show that AdaptCL introduces little computing and communication\noverhead.

A few studies have made\ngreat progress either through image translation with deep latent features or\nneural rendering with explicit 3D features. However, both of them rely on large\namounts of training data to generate realistic results, and the performance\ndegrades on more accessible internet videos due to insufficient training\nframes. In this paper, we demonstrate that the dynamic details can be preserved\neven trained from short monocular videos. Overall, we propose a neural video\nrendering framework coupled with an image-translation-based dynamic details\ngeneration network (D2G-Net), which fully utilizes both the stability of\nexplicit 3D features and the capacity of learning components. To be specific, a\nnovel texture representation is presented to encode both the static and\npose-varying appearance characteristics, which is then mapped to the image\nspace and rendered as a detail-rich frame in the neural rendering stage.\nMoreover, we introduce a concise temporal loss in the training stage to\nsuppress the detail flickering that is made more visible due to high-quality\ndynamic details generated by our method.

Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the semi-supervised\nsegmentation problem where only a small set of labeled data is provided with a\nmuch larger collection of totally unlabeled images. Nevertheless, due to the\nlimited annotations, models may overly rely on the contexts available in the\ntraining data, which causes poor generalization to the scenes unseen before.

Moreover, we present the Directional Contrastive Loss (DC Loss)\nto accomplish the consistency in a pixel-to-pixel manner, only requiring the\nfeature with lower quality to be aligned towards its counterpart. In addition,\nto avoid the false-negative samples and filter the uncertain positive samples,\nwe put forward two sampling strategies.

    "title": "Query-graph with Cross-gating Attention Model for Text-to-Audio  Grounding",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the text-to-audio grounding issue, namely,\ngrounding the segments of the sound event described by a natural language query\nin the untrimmed audio. This is a newly proposed but challenging audio-language\ntask, since it requires to not only precisely localize all the on- and off-sets\nof the desired segments in the audio, but to perform comprehensive acoustic and\nlinguistic understandings and reason the multimodal interactions between the\naudio and query. To tackle those problems, the existing method treats the query\nholistically as a single unit by a global query representation, which fails to\nhighlight the keywords that contain rich semantics. Besides, this method has\nnot fully exploited interactions between the query and audio. Moreover, since\nthe audio and queries are arbitrary and variable in length, many meaningless\nparts of them are not filtered out in this method, which hinders the grounding\nof the desired segments.\nTo this end, we propose a novel Query Graph with Cross-gating Attention\n(QGCA) model, which models the comprehensive relations between the words in\nquery through a novel query graph. Besides, to capture the fine-grained\ninteractions between audio and query, a cross-modal attention module that\nassigns higher weights to the keywords is introduced to generate the\nsnippet-specific query representations. Finally, we also design a cross-gating\nmodule to emphasize the crucial parts as well as weaken the irrelevant ones in\nthe audio and query. We extensively evaluate the proposed QGCA model on the\npublic Audiogrounding dataset with significant improvements over several\nstate-of-the-art methods. Moreover, further ablation study shows the consistent\neffectiveness of different modules in the proposed QGCA model.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are emerging as powerful tools for image\nprocessing in important commercial applications. We focus on the important\nproblem of improving the latency of image recognition. CNNs' large data at each\nlayer's input, filters, and output poses a memory bandwidth problem. While\nprevious work captures only some of the enormous data reuse, full reuse implies\nthat the initial input image and filters are read once from off chip and the\nfinal output is written once off chip without spilling the intermediate layers'\ndata to off-chip. We propose Occam to capture full reuse via four\ncontributions. (1) We identify the necessary condition for full reuse. (2) We\nidentify the dependence closure as the sufficient condition to capture full\nreuse using the least on-chip memory. (3) Because the dependence closure is\noften too large to fit in on-chip memory, we propose a dynamic programming\nalgorithm that optimally partitions a given CNN to guarantee the least off-chip\ntraffic at the partition boundaries for a given on-chip capacity. Occam's\npartitions reside on different chips forming a pipeline so that a partition's\nfilters and dependence closure remain on-chip as different images pass through\n(i.e., each partition incurs off-chip traffic only for its inputs and outputs).\n(4) because the optimal partitions may result in an unbalanced pipeline, we\npropose staggered asynchronous pipelines (STAP) which replicates the bottleneck\nstages to improve throughput by staggering the mini-batches across the\nreplicas. Importantly, STAP achieves balanced pipelines without changing\nOccam's optimal partitioning. Our simulations show that Occam cuts off-chip\ntransfers by 21x and achieves 2.06x and 1.36x better performance, and 33\\% and\n24\\% better energy than the base case and Layer Fusion, respectively. On an\nFPGA implementation, Occam performs 5.1x better than the base case.",

    "abstract": "Reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDH-EI) has attracted increasing\nattention, since it can protect the privacy of original images while the\nembedded data can be exactly extracted. Recently, some RDH-EI schemes with\nmultiple data hiders have been proposed using secret sharing technique.\nHowever, these schemes protect the contents of the original images with\nlightweight security level. In this paper, we propose a high-security RDH-EI\nscheme with multiple data hiders. First, we introduce a cipher-feedback secret\nsharing (CFSS) technique. It follows the cryptography standards by introducing\nthe cipher-feedback strategy of AES. Then, using the CFSS technique, we devise\na new (r,n)-threshold (r<=n) RDH-EI scheme with multiple data hiders called\nCFSS-RDHEI. It can encrypt an original image into n encrypted images with\nreduced size using an encryption key and sends each encrypted image to one data\nhider. Each data hider can independently embed secret data into the encrypted\nimage to obtain the corresponding marked encrypted image. The original image\ncan be completely recovered from r marked encrypted images and the encryption\nkey. Performance evaluations show that our CFSS-RDHEI scheme has high embedding\nrate and its generated encrypted images are much smaller, compared to existing\nsecret sharing-based RDH-EI schemes.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of flexible loads in providing\nfrequency response services. However, uncertainty and variability in various\nweather-related and end-use behavioral factors often affect the demand-side\ncontrol performance. This work addresses this problem with the design of a\ndemand-side control to achieve frequency response under load uncertainties. Our\napproach involves modeling the load uncertainties via stochastic processes that\nappear as both multiplicative and additive to the system states in closed-loop\npower system dynamics. Extending the recently developed mean square exponential\nstability (MSES) results for stochastic systems, we formulate multi-objective\nlinear matrix inequality (LMI)-based optimal control synthesis problems to not\nonly guarantee stochastic stability, but also promote sparsity, enhance\nclosed-loop transient performance, and maximize allowable uncertainties. The\nfundamental trade-off between the maximum allowable (\\textit{critical})\nuncertainty levels and the optimal stochastic stabilizing control efforts is\nestablished. Moreover, the sparse control synthesis problem is generalized to\nthe realistic power systems scenario in which only partial-state measurements\nare available. Detailed numerical studies are carried out on IEEE 39-bus system\nto demonstrate the closed-loop stochastic stabilizing performance of the sparse\ncontrollers in enhancing frequency response under load uncertainties; as well\nas illustrate the fundamental trade-off between the allowable uncertainties and\noptimal control efforts.",

    "abstract": "As people spend up to 87% of their time indoors, intelligent Heating,\nVentilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in buildings are essential for\nmaintaining occupant comfort and reducing energy consumption. Those HVAC\nsystems in modern smart buildings rely on real-time sensor readings, which in\npractice often suffer from various faults and could also be vulnerable to\nmalicious attacks. Such faulty sensor inputs may lead to the violation of\nindoor environment requirements (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) and the\nincrease of energy consumption. While many model-based approaches have been\nproposed in the literature for building HVAC control, it is costly to develop\naccurate physical models for ensuring their performance and even more\nchallenging to address the impact of sensor faults. In this work, we present a\nnovel learning-based framework for sensor fault-tolerant HVAC control, which\nincludes three deep learning based components for 1) generating temperature\nproposals with the consideration of possible sensor faults, 2) selecting one of\nthe proposals based on the assessment of their accuracy, and 3) applying\nreinforcement learning with the selected temperature proposal. Moreover, to\naddress the challenge of training data insufficiency in building-related tasks,\nwe propose a model-assisted learning method leveraging an abstract model of\nbuilding physical dynamics.

    "abstract": "Modern magnetic sensor arrays conventionally utilize state of the art low\npower magnetometers such as parallel and orthogonal fluxgates. Low power\nfluxgates tend to have large Barkhausen jumps that appear as a dc jump in the\nfluxgate output. This phenomenon deteriorates the signal fidelity and\neffectively increases the internal sensor noise. Even if sensors that are more\nprone to dc jumps can be screened during production, the conventional noise\nmeasurement does not always catch the dc jump because of its sparsity.\nMoreover, dc jumps persist in almost all the sensor cores although at a slower\nbut still intolerable rate. Even if dc jumps can be easily detected in a\nshielded environment, when deployed in presence of natural noise and clutter,\nit can be hard to positively detect them. This work fills this gap and presents\nalgorithms that distinguish dc jumps embedded in natural magnetic field data.\nTo improve robustness to noise, we developed two machine learning algorithms\nthat employ temporal and statistical physical-based features of a pre-acquired\nand well-known experimental data set. The first algorithm employs a support\nvector machine classifier, while the second is based on a neural network\narchitecture. We compare these new approaches to a more classical kernel-based\nmethod. To that purpose, the receiver operating characteristic curve is\ngenerated, which allows diagnosis ability of the different classifiers by\ncomparing their performances across various operation points. The accuracy of\nthe machine learning-based algorithms over the classic method is highly\nemphasized. In addition, high generalization and robustness of the neural\nnetwork can be concluded, based on the rapid convergence of the corresponding\nreceiver operating characteristic curves.",

For example, rotation of a cylinder by any amount around\nits centerline does not change its geometric shape relative to the grasper.\nObjects that can be approximated to solids of revolution or contain other\ngeometric symmetries are prevalent in everyday life, and this information can\nbe employed to improve the efficiency of existing grasp planning models. This\npaper experimentally investigates change in human-planned grasps under varied\nobject orientations. With 13,440 recorded human grasps, our results indicate\nthat during pick-and-place task of ordinary objects, stable grasps can be\nachieved with a small subset of grasp types, and the wrist-related parameters\nfollow normal distribution. Furthermore, we show this knowledge can allow\nfaster convergence of grasp planning algorithm.",

    "title": "Few-Shot Domain Expansion for Face Anti-Spoofing",
    "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) is an indispensable and widely used module in face\nrecognition systems. Although high accuracy has been achieved, a FAS system\nwill never be perfect due to the non-stationary applied environments and the\npotential emergence of new types of presentation attacks in real-world\napplications. In practice, given a handful of labeled samples from a new\ndeployment scenario (target domain) and abundant labeled face images in the\nexisting source domain, the FAS system is expected to perform well in the new\nscenario without sacrificing the performance on the original domain. To this\nend, we identify and address a more practical problem: Few-Shot Domain\nExpansion for Face Anti-Spoofing (FSDE-FAS). This problem is challenging since\nwith insufficient target domain training samples, the model may suffer from\nboth overfitting to the target domain and catastrophic forgetting of the source\ndomain. To address the problem, this paper proposes a Style transfer-based\nAugmentation for Semantic Alignment (SASA) framework. We propose to augment the\ntarget data by generating auxiliary samples based on photorealistic style\ntransfer. With the assistant of the augmented data, we further propose a\ncarefully designed mechanism to align different domains from both\ninstance-level and distribution-level, and then stabilize the performance on\nthe source domain with a less-forgetting constraint. Two benchmarks are\nproposed to simulate the FSDE-FAS scenarios, and the experimental results show\nthat the proposed SASA method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Extracting relational triples from texts is a fundamental task in knowledge\ngraph construction. The popular way of existing methods is to jointly extract\nentities and relations using a single model, which often suffers from the\noverlapping triple problem. That is, there are multiple relational triples that\nshare the same entities within one sentence. In this work, we propose an\neffective cascade dual-decoder approach to extract overlapping relational\ntriples, which includes a text-specific relation decoder and a\nrelation-corresponded entity decoder. Our approach is straightforward: the\ntext-specific relation decoder detects relations from a sentence according to\nits text semantics and treats them as extra features to guide the entity\nextraction; for each extracted relation, which is with trainable embedding, the\nrelation-corresponded entity decoder detects the corresponding head and tail\nentities using a span-based tagging scheme. In this way, the overlapping triple\nproblem is tackled naturally. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate\nthat our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves\nbetter F1 scores under the strict evaluation metric.

It aims to infer the\nusers' bipolar ideas using visual, textual, and acoustic signals. Although\nresearchers affirm the association between cognitive cues and emotional\nmanifestations, most of the current multimodal approaches in sentiment analysis\ndisregard user-specific aspects. To tackle this issue, we devise a novel method\nto perform multimodal sentiment prediction using cognitive cues, such as\npersonality. Our framework constructs an adaptive tree by hierarchically\ndividing users and trains the LSTM-based submodels, utilizing an\nattention-based fusion to transfer cognitive-oriented knowledge within the\ntree. Subsequently, the framework consumes the conclusive agglomerative\nknowledge from the adaptive tree to predict final sentiments. We also devise a\ndynamic dropout method to facilitate data sharing between neighboring nodes,\nreducing data sparsity. The empirical results on real-world datasets determine\nthat our proposed model for sentiment prediction can surpass trending rivals.\nMoreover, compared to other ensemble approaches, the proposed transfer-based\nalgorithm can better utilize the latent cognitive cues and foster the\nprediction outcomes.

The nodal force contributions are expressed using only the Jacobian\noperator, instead of the deformation gradient tensor and finite deformation\ntensor, for fewer computational operations at run-time. Owing to this proposed\nJacobian formulation, novel expressions are developed for strain invariants and\nconstant components, which are also based on the Jacobian operator. Results\nshow that the proposed DJ-TLED consumed between 0.70x and 0.88x CPU solution\ntimes compared to state-of-the-art TLED and achieved up to 121.72x and 94.26x\nspeed improvements in tetrahedral and hexahedral meshes, respectively, using\nGPU acceleration.

Such a force\nformulation can be beneficial for fast deformation computation and can be\nparticularly useful if the displacement field is of primary interest, which is\ndemonstrated using a neurosurgical simulation of brain deformations for\nimage-guided neurosurgery.

In this paper, we propose an\nEntropy-Based Convolutional Layer Estimation (EBCLE) heuristic which is robust\nand simple, yet effective in resolving the problem of over-parameterization\nwith regards to network depth of CNN model. The EBCLE heuristic employs a\npriori knowledge of the entropic data distribution of input datasets to\ndetermine an upper bound for convolutional network depth, beyond which identity\ntransformations are prevalent offering insignificant contributions for\nenhancing model performance. Restricting depth redundancies by forcing feature\ncompression and abstraction restricts over-parameterization while decreasing\ntraining time by 24.99% - 78.59% without degradation in model performance. We\npresent empirical evidence to emphasize the relative effectiveness of broader,\nyet shallower models trained using the EBCLE heuristic, which maintains or\noutperforms baseline classification accuracies of narrower yet deeper models.\nThe EBCLE heuristic is architecturally agnostic and EBCLE based CNN models\nrestrict depth redundancies resulting in enhanced utilization of the available\ncomputational resources. The proposed EBCLE heuristic is a compelling technique\nfor researchers to analytically justify their HyperParameter (HP) choices for\nCNNs. Empirical validation of the EBCLE heuristic in training CNN models was\nestablished on five benchmarking datasets (ImageNet32, CIFAR-10/100, STL-10,\nMNIST) and four network architectures (DenseNet, ResNet, ResNeXt and\nEfficientNet B0-B2) with appropriate statistical tests employed to infer any\nconclusive claims presented in this paper.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method of Category-level 6D Object Pose and Size Estimation\n(COPSE) from a single depth image, without external pose-annotated real-world\ntraining data. While previous works exploit visual cues in RGB(D) images, our\nmethod makes inferences based on the rich geometric information of the object\nin the depth channel alone. Essentially, our framework explores such geometric\ninformation by learning the unified 3D Orientation-Consistent Representations\n(3D-OCR) module, and further enforced by the property of Geometry-constrained\nReflection Symmetry (GeoReS) module. The magnitude information of object size\nand the center point is finally estimated by Mirror-Paired Dimensional\nEstimation (MPDE) module. Extensive experiments on the category-level NOCS\nbenchmark demonstrate that our framework competes with state-of-the-art\napproaches that require labeled real-world images. We also deploy our approach\nto a physical Baxter robot to perform manipulation tasks on unseen but\ncategory-known instances, and the results further validate the efficacy of our\nproposed model.

To explore the answer, we give a thorough review of data representations\nin CSS for both text and network.

From the statistics of these applications, we unearth the strength of\neach kind of representations and discover the tendency that embedding-based\nrepresentations are emerging and obtaining increasing attention over the last\ndecade.

However, the realization of drone-based\nnetworks raises several issues. One of the critical issues is drones are\nextremely power-hungry. To overcome this, we need to characterize a new type of\ndrones, so-called charging drones, which can deliver energy to MBS drones.\nMotivated by the fact that the charging drones also need to be charged, we\ndeploy ground-mounted charging towers for delivering energy to the charging\ndrones. We introduce a new energy-efficiency maximization problem, which is\npartitioned into two independently separable tasks. More specifically, as our\nfirst optimization task, two-stage charging matching is proposed due to the\ninherent nature of our network model, where the first matching aims to schedule\nbetween charging towers and charging drones while the second matching solves\nthe scheduling between charging drones and MBS drones. We analyze how to\nconvert the formulation containing non-convex terms to another one only with\nconvex terms. As our second optimization task, each MBS drone conducts\nenergy-aware time-average transmit power allocation minimization subject to\nstability via Lyapunov optimization. Our solutions enable the MBS drones to\nextend their lifetimes; in turn, network coverage-time can be extended.",

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims to leverage users' historical behaviors to\npredict their next interaction. Existing works have not yet addressed two main\nchallenges in sequential recommendation. First, user behaviors in their rich\nhistorical sequences are often implicit and noisy preference signals, they\ncannot sufficiently reflect users' actual preferences. In addition, users'\ndynamic preferences often change rapidly over time, and hence it is difficult\nto capture user patterns in their historical sequences. In this work, we\npropose a graph neural network model called SURGE (short for SeqUential\nRecommendation with Graph neural nEtworks) to address these two issues.\nSpecifically, SURGE integrates different types of preferences in long-term user\nbehaviors into clusters in the graph by re-constructing loose item sequences\ninto tight item-item interest graphs based on metric learning. This helps\nexplicitly distinguish users' core interests, by forming dense clusters in the\ninterest graph. Then, we perform cluster-aware and query-aware graph\nconvolutional propagation and graph pooling on the constructed graph. It\ndynamically fuses and extracts users' current activated core interests from\nnoisy user behavior sequences. We conduct extensive experiments on both public\nand proprietary industrial datasets. Experimental results demonstrate\nsignificant performance gains of our proposed method compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Considering\nthat the SE improvement in the CRNs is limited due to the interference\ntemperature imposed on the primary user (PU), and the severe path loss and high\ndirectivity in mmWave communications make it vulnerable to blockage events, we\nintroduce an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) into mmWave CRNs. This paper\ninvestigates the robust secure beamforming (BF) design in the IRS-assisted\nmmWave CRNs. By using a uniform linear array (ULA) at the cognitive base\nstation (CBS) and a uniform planar array (UPA) at the IRS, and supposing that\nthe imperfect channel state information (CSI) of wiretap links is known, we\nformulate a constrained problem to maximize the worst-case achievable secrecy\nrate (ASR) of the secondary user (SU) by jointly designing the transmit BF at\nthe CBS and reflect BF at the IRS. To solve the non-convex problem with coupled\nvariables, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is proposed. As for\nthe transmit BF at the CBS, we propose a heuristic robust transmit BF algorithm\nto attain the BF vectors analytically. As for the reflect BF at the IRS, by\nmeans of an auxiliary variable, we transform the non-convex problem into a\nsemi-definite programming (SDP) problem with rank-1 constraint, which is\nhandled with the help of an iterative penalty function, and then obtain the\noptimal reflect BF through CVX.

However, overheads\nincurred by a heavy software-stack intervention seriously negate the benefits\nof such memories. First, to significantly reduce the software stack overheads,\nwe propose HAMS, a hardware automated Memory-over-Storage (MoS) solution.\nSpecifically, HAMS aggregates the capacity of NVDIMM and ultra-low latency\nflash archives (ULL-Flash) into a single large memory space, which can be used\nas a working or persistent memory expansion, in an OS-transparent manner. HAMS\nresides in the memory controller hub and manages its MoS address pool over\nconventional DDR and NVMe interfaces; it employs a simple hardware cache to\nserve all the memory requests from the host MMU after mapping the storage space\nof ULL-Flash to the memory space of NVDIMM. Second, to make HAMS more\nenergy-efficient and reliable, we propose an \"advanced HAMS\" which removes\nunnecessary data transfers between NVDIMM and ULL-Flash after optimizing the\ndatapath and hardware modules of HAMS. This approach unleashes the ULL-Flash\nand its NVMe controller from the storage box and directly connects the HAMS\ndatapath to NVDIMM over the conventional DDR4 interface. Our evaluations show\nthat HAMS and advanced HAMS can offer 97% and 119% higher system performance\nthan a software-based hybrid NVDIMM design, while consuming 41% and 45% lower\nsystem energy, respectively.",

The framework is\nillustrated by applying it to a healthcare application. For the inverse\npairing, machine learning can impact conceptual modeling through text and rule\nmining, as well as knowledge graphs. The pairing of conceptual modeling and\nmachine learning in this this way should help lay the foundations for future\nresearch.",

However, owing to the lack of full\ntrust in the cloud, the cloud users prefer privacy-preserving outsourced data\ncomputation with correctness verification. However, cryptography-based schemes\nintroduce high computational costs to both the cloud and its users for\nverifiable computation with privacy preservation, which makes it difficult to\nsupport complicated computations in practice.\nIntel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) as a trusted execution environment is\nwidely researched in various fields (such as secure data analytics and\ncomputation), and is regarded as a promising way to achieve efficient\noutsourced data computation with privacy preservation over the cloud. But we\nfind two types of threats towards the computation with SGX: Disarranging\nData-Related Code threat and Output Tampering and Misrouting threat. In this\npaper, we depict these threats using formal methods and successfully conduct\nthe two threats on the enclave program constructed by Rust SGX SDK to\ndemonstrate their impacts on the correctness of computations over SGX enclaves.\nIn order to provide countermeasures, we propose an efficient and secure scheme\nto resist the threats and realize verifiable computation for Intel SGX.

This study aims to improve running speed by\nperforming human detection at a certain frame interval because it accounts for\nmost of the running time. The question is how to maintain accuracy while\nskipping human detection.

To maintain the\ntracking accuracy, we introduce robust interest point selection within human\nregions and a tracking termination metric calculated by the distribution of the\ninterest points.

In a context where workers'\ncontributions are now easily comparable, we modify the Peer Truth Serum for\nCrowdsourcing mechanism (PTSC) for FD to reward honest participation based on\npeer consistency in an incentive compatible fashion.

    "abstract": "Polygonal meshes are ubiquitous, but have only played a relatively minor role\nin the deep learning revolution. State-of-the-art neural generative models for\n3D shapes learn implicit functions and generate meshes via expensive\niso-surfacing. We overcome these challenges by employing a classical spatial\ndata structure from computer graphics, Binary Space Partitioning (BSP), to\nfacilitate 3D learning. The core operation of BSP involves recursive\nsubdivision of 3D space to obtain convex sets. By exploiting this property, we\ndevise BSP-Net, a network that learns to represent a 3D shape via convex\ndecomposition without supervision. The network is trained to reconstruct a\nshape using a set of convexes obtained from a BSP-tree built over a set of\nplanes, where the planes and convexes are both defined by learned network\nweights. BSP-Net directly outputs polygonal meshes from the inferred convexes.\nThe generated meshes are watertight, compact (i.e., low-poly), and well suited\nto represent sharp geometry. We show that the reconstruction quality by BSP-Net\nis competitive with those from state-of-the-art methods while using much fewer\nprimitives. We also explore variations to BSP-Net including using a more\ngeneric decoder for reconstruction, more general primitives than planes, as\nwell as training a generative model with variational auto-encoders.

    "abstract": "When we fine-tune a well-trained deep learning model for a new set of\nclasses, the network learns new concepts but gradually forgets the knowledge of\nold training. In some real-life applications, we may be interested in learning\nnew classes without forgetting the capability of previous experience. Such\nlearning without forgetting problem is often investigated using 2D image\nrecognition tasks. In this paper, considering the growth of depth camera\ntechnology, we address the same problem for the 3D point cloud object data.\nThis problem becomes more challenging in the 3D domain than 2D because of the\nunavailability of large datasets and powerful pretrained backbone models. We\ninvestigate knowledge distillation techniques on 3D data to reduce catastrophic\nforgetting of the previous training. Moreover, we improve the distillation\nprocess by using semantic word vectors of object classes. We observe that\nexploring the interrelation of old and new knowledge during training helps to\nlearn new concepts without forgetting old ones. Experimenting on three 3D point\ncloud recognition backbones (PointNet, DGCNN, and PointConv) and synthetic\n(ModelNet40, ModelNet10) and real scanned (ScanObjectNN) datasets, we establish\nnew baseline results on learning without forgetting for 3D data.

We show that kernels defined by\npseudo-differential operators are able to approximate uniformly any continuous\nMercer kernel on a compact set.\nThe symbol $p({\\mathbf x}, {\\mathbf y})$ encapsulates a lot of useful\ninformation about the structure of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy distance\ndefined by the kernel $K$. We approximate $p({\\mathbf x}, {\\mathbf y})$ with\nthe sum of the first $r$ terms of the Singular Value Decomposition of $p$,\ndenoted by $p_r({\\mathbf x}, {\\mathbf y})$. If ordered singular values of the\nintegral operator associated with $p({\\mathbf x}, {\\mathbf y})$ die down\nrapidly, the MMD distance defined by the new symbol $p_r$ differs from the\ninitial one only slightly. Moreover, the new MMD distance can be interpreted as\nan aggregated result of comparing $r$ local moments of two probability\ndistributions.\nThe latter results holds under the condition that right singular vectors of\nthe integral operator associated with $p$ are uniformly bounded. But even if\nthis is not satisfied we can still hold that the Hilbert-Schmidt distance\nbetween $p$ and $p_r$ vanishes. Thus, we report an interesting phenomenon: the\nMMD distance measures the difference of two probability distributions with\nrespect to a certain number of local moments, $r^\\ast$, and this number\n$r^\\ast$ depends on the speed with which singular values of $p$ die down.",

In this chapter, the authors utilize the\nimaging geometry and present approaches that perform 3D reconstruction from\ncross-view images that are drastically different in their viewpoints. We\nintroduce our framework that takes ground-view images and satellite images for\nfull 3D recovery, which includes necessary methods in satellite and\nground-based point cloud generation from images, 3D data co-registration,\nfusion and mesh generation. We demonstrate our proposed framework on a dataset\nconsisting of twelve satellite images and 150k video frames acquired through a\nvehicle-mounted Go-pro camera and demonstrate the reconstruction results. We\nhave also compared our results with results generated from an intuitive\nprocessing pipeline that involves typical geo-registration and meshing methods.",

The edit operations can be mapped to atomic\ntransition units. Through this approach, the animated transition between two\ncharts can be expressed as a set of transition units. Then, we conduct a\nformative study to understand people's preferences for animation sequences.\nBased on the study, we propose a set of principles and a sequence composition\nalgorithm to compose the transition units into a meaningful animation sequence.\nFinally, we synthesize these units together to deliver a smooth and intuitive\nanimated transition between charts.

    "abstract": "Python type inference is challenging in practice. Due to its dynamic\nproperties and extensive dependencies on third-party libraries without type\nannotations, the performance of traditional static analysis techniques is\nlimited. Although semantics in source code can help manifest intended usage for\nvariables (thus help infer types), they are usually ignored by existing tools.\nIn this paper, we propose PYInfer, an end-to-end learning-based type inference\ntool that automatically generates type annotations for Python variables. The\nkey insight is that contextual code semantics is critical in inferring the type\nfor a variable. For each use of a variable, we collect a few tokens within its\ncontextual scope, and design a neural network to predict its type. One\nchallenge is that it is difficult to collect a high-quality human-labeled\ntraining dataset for this purpose. To address this issue, we apply an existing\nstatic analyzer to generate the ground truth for variables in source code.\nOur main contribution is a novel approach to statically infer variable types\neffectively and efficiently. Formulating the type inference as a classification\nproblem, we can handle user-defined types and predict type probabilities for\neach variable. Our model achieves 91.2% accuracy on classifying 11 basic types\nin Python and 81.2% accuracy on classifying 500 most common types. Our results\nsubstantially outperform the state-of-the-art type annotators. Moreover,\nPYInfer achieves 5.2X more code coverage and is 187X faster than a\nstate-of-the-art learning-based tool. With similar time consumption, our model\nannotates 5X more variables than a state-of-the-art static analysis tool. Our\nmodel also outperforms a learning-based function-level annotator on annotating\ntypes for variables and function arguments.

Conventional UFLS methods, most of which are off-line, usually\nshed fixed amounts of predetermined loads based on a predetermined schedule\nwhich can lead to over or under curtailment of load. This paper presents a\nco-operative game theory-based two-stage strategy to effectively and precisely\ndetermine locations and amounts of loads to be shed for UFLS control. In the\nfirst stage, the total amount of loads to be shed, also referred to as deficit\nin generation or the disturbance power, is computed using the initial rate of\nchange of frequency (ROCOF) referred to the equivalent inertial center. In the\nsecond stage, the Shapley value, one of the solution concepts of cooperative\ngame theory, is used to determine load shedding amounts and locations. The\nproposed method is implemented on the reduced 9-bus 3-machine Western\nElectricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system and simulated on Real-time\nDigital Simulators (RTDS).

    "abstract": "Many deep learning based methods are designed to remove non-uniform\n(spatially variant) motion blur caused by object motion and camera shake\nwithout knowing the blur kernel. Some methods directly output the latent sharp\nimage in one stage, while others utilize a multi-stage strategy (\\eg\nmulti-scale, multi-patch, or multi-temporal) to gradually restore the sharp\nimage. However, these methods have the following two main issues: 1) The\ncomputational cost of multi-stage is high; 2) The same convolution kernel is\napplied in different regions, which is not an ideal choice for non-uniform\nblur. Hence, non-uniform motion deblurring is still a challenging and open\nproblem. In this paper, we propose a new architecture which consists of\nmultiple Atrous Spatial Pyramid Deformable Convolution (ASPDC) modules to\ndeblur an image end-to-end with more flexibility. Multiple ASPDC modules\nimplicitly learn the pixel-specific motion with different dilation rates in the\nsame layer to handle movements of different magnitude.

    "abstract": "Deep equilibrium networks (DEQs) are a new class of models that eschews\ntraditional depth in favor of finding the fixed point of a single nonlinear\nlayer. These models have been shown to achieve performance competitive with the\nstate-of-the-art deep networks while using significantly less memory. Yet they\nare also slower, brittle to architectural choices, and introduce potential\ninstability to the model. In this paper, we propose a regularization scheme for\nDEQ models that explicitly regularizes the Jacobian of the fixed-point update\nequations to stabilize the learning of equilibrium models. We show that this\nregularization adds only minimal computational cost, significantly stabilizes\nthe fixed-point convergence in both forward and backward passes, and scales\nwell to high-dimensional, realistic domains (e.g., WikiText-103 language\nmodeling and ImageNet classification). Using this method, we demonstrate, for\nthe first time, an implicit-depth model that runs with approximately the same\nspeed and level of performance as popular conventional deep networks such as\nResNet-101, while still maintaining the constant memory footprint and\narchitectural simplicity of DEQs.

    "abstract": "Supervised learning, while deployed in real-life scenarios, often encounters\ninstances of unknown classes. Conventional algorithms for training a supervised\nlearning model do not provide an option to detect such instances, so they\nmiss-classify such instances with 100% probability. Open Set Recognition (OSR)\nand Non-Exhaustive Learning (NEL) are potential solutions to overcome this\nproblem. Most existing methods of OSR first classify members of existing\nclasses and then identify instances of new classes. However, many of the\nexisting methods of OSR only makes a binary decision, i.e., they only identify\nthe existence of the unknown class. Hence, such methods cannot distinguish test\ninstances belonging to incremental unseen classes. On the other hand, the\nmajority of NEL methods often make a parametric assumption over the data\ndistribution, which either fail to return good results, due to the reason that\nreal-life complex datasets may not follow a well-known data distribution. In\nthis paper, we propose a new online non-exhaustive learning model, namely,\nNon-Exhaustive Gaussian Mixture Generative Adversarial Networks (NE-GM-GAN) to\naddress these issues. Our proposed model synthesizes Gaussian mixture based\nlatent representation over a deep generative model, such as GAN, for\nincremental detection of instances of emerging classes in the test data.\nExtensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that\nNE-GM-GAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in detecting\ninstances of novel classes in streaming data.",

We present Revelio, a\ndebugging assistant which takes user reports and system logs as input, and\noutputs debugging queries that developers can use to find a bug's root cause.\nThe key challenges lie in (1) combining inputs of different types (e.g.,\nnatural language reports and quantitative logs) and (2) generalizing to unseen\nfaults. Revelio addresses these by employing deep neural networks to uniformly\nembed diverse input sources and potential queries into a high-dimensional\nvector space. In addition, it exploits observations from production systems to\nfactorize query generation into two computationally and statistically simpler\nlearning tasks. To evaluate Revelio, we built a testbed with multiple\ndistributed applications and debugging tools.

Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender, and\nrecent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias\nof our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine).

    "abstract": "Target speech separation is the process of filtering a certain speaker's\nvoice out of speech mixtures according to the additional speaker identity\ninformation provided. Recent works have made considerable improvement by\nprocessing signals in the time domain directly. The majority of them take fully\noverlapped speech mixtures for training. However, since most real-life\nconversations occur randomly and are sparsely overlapped, we argue that\ntraining with different overlap ratio data benefits. To do so, an unavoidable\nproblem is that the popularly used SI-SNR loss has no definition for silent\nsources. This paper proposes the weighted SI-SNR loss, together with the joint\nlearning of target speech separation and personal VAD. The weighted SI-SNR loss\nimposes a weight factor that is proportional to the target speaker's duration\nand returns zero when the target speaker is absent. Meanwhile, the personal VAD\ngenerates masks and sets non-target speech to silence. Experiments show that\nour proposed method outperforms the baseline by 1.73 dB in terms of SDR on\nfully overlapped speech, as well as by 4.17 dB and 0.9 dB on sparsely\noverlapped speech of clean and noisy conditions.

    "abstract": "A recent study has introduced a procedure to quantify the survivability of a\nteam of armoured fighting vehicles when it is subjected to a single missile\nattack. In particular this study investigated the concept of collaborative\nactive protection systems, focusing on the case where vehicle defence is\nprovided by high power radio frequency directed energy weapons. The purpose of\nthe current paper is to demonstrate how this analysis can be extended to\naccount for more than one missile threat. This is achieved by introducing a\njump stochastic process whose states represent the number of missiles defeated\nat a given time instant. Analysis proceeds through consideration of the sojourn\ntimes of this stochastic process, and it is shown how consideration of these\njump times can be related to transition probabilities of the auxiliary\nstochastic process. The latter probabilities are then related to the\nprobabilities of detection and disruption of missile threats. The sum of these\nsojourn times can then be used to quantify the survivability of the team at any\ngiven time instant. Due to the fact that there is much interest in the\napplication of high energy lasers in the context of this paper, the numerical\nexamples will thus focus on such directed energy weapons for armoured fighting\nvehicle team defence.",

    "abstract": "The recent vision transformer(i.e.for image classification) learns non-local\nattentive interaction of different patch tokens. However, prior arts miss\nlearning the cross-scale dependencies of different pixels, the semantic\ncorrespondence of different labels, and the consistency of the feature\nrepresentations and semantic embeddings, which are critical for biomedical\nsegmentation. In this paper, we tackle the above issues by proposing a unified\ntransformer network, termed Multi-Compound Transformer (MCTrans), which\nincorporates rich feature learning and semantic structure mining into a unified\nframework. Specifically, MCTrans embeds the multi-scale convolutional features\nas a sequence of tokens and performs intra- and inter-scale self-attention,\nrather than single-scale attention in previous works. In addition, a learnable\nproxy embedding is also introduced to model semantic relationship and feature\nenhancement by using self-attention and cross-attention, respectively. MCTrans\ncan be easily plugged into a UNet-like network and attains a significant\nimprovement over the state-of-the-art methods in biomedical image segmentation\nin six standard benchmarks. For example, MCTrans outperforms UNet by 3.64%,\n3.71%, 4.34%, 2.8%, 1.88%, 1.57% in Pannuke, CVC-Clinic, CVC-Colon, Etis,\nKavirs, ISIC2018 dataset, respectively.

    "abstract": "This paper presents Kimera-Multi, the first multi-robot system that (i) is\nrobust and capable of identifying and rejecting incorrect inter and intra-robot\nloop closures resulting from perceptual aliasing, (ii) is fully distributed and\nonly relies on local (peer-to-peer) communication to achieve distributed\nlocalization and mapping, and (iii) builds a globally consistent\nmetric-semantic 3D mesh model of the environment in real-time, where faces of\nthe mesh are annotated with semantic labels. Kimera-Multi is implemented by a\nteam of robots equipped with visual-inertial sensors. Each robot builds a local\ntrajectory estimate and a local mesh using Kimera. When communication is\navailable, robots initiate a distributed place recognition and robust pose\ngraph optimization protocol based on a novel distributed graduated\nnon-convexity algorithm. The proposed protocol allows the robots to improve\ntheir local trajectory estimates by leveraging inter-robot loop closures while\nbeing robust to outliers. Finally, each robot uses its improved trajectory\nestimate to correct the local mesh using mesh deformation techniques.\nWe demonstrate Kimera-Multi in photo-realistic simulations, SLAM benchmarking\ndatasets, and challenging outdoor datasets collected using ground robots. Both\nreal and simulated experiments involve long trajectories (e.g., up to 800\nmeters per robot). The experiments show that Kimera-Multi (i) outperforms the\nstate of the art in terms of robustness and accuracy, (ii) achieves estimation\nerrors comparable to a centralized SLAM system while being fully distributed,\n(iii) is parsimonious in terms of communication bandwidth, (iv) produces\naccurate metric-semantic 3D meshes, and (v) is modular and can be also used for\nstandard 3D reconstruction (i.e., without semantic labels) or for trajectory\nestimation (i.e., without reconstructing a 3D mesh).",

Improving\nthe recommendation of tail items can promote novelty and bring positive effects\nto both users and providers, and thus is a desirable property of recommender\nsystems. Current novel recommendation studies over-emphasize the importance of\ntail items without differentiating the degree of users' intent on popularity\nand often incur a sharp decline of accuracy. Moreover, none of existing methods\nhas ever taken the extreme case of tail items, i.e., cold-start items without\nany interaction, into consideration.\nIn this work, we first disclose the mechanism that drives a user's\ninteraction towards popular or niche items by disentangling her intent into\nconformity influence (popularity) and personal interests (preference). We then\npresent a unified end-to-end framework to simultaneously optimize accuracy and\nnovelty targets based on the disentangled intent of popularity and that of\npreference. We further develop a new paradigm for novel recommendation of\ncold-start items which exploits the self-supervised learning technique to model\nthe correlation between collaborative features and content features.

This\ncharacteristic was used to differentiate between encrypted files and other high\nentropy files such as archives. This discovery was leveraged in the development\nof a file classification model that used the differential area between the\nentropy curve of a file under analysis and one generated from random data.

We consider here a scenario where\nthe learning agent has the ability to collect online experiences through direct\ninteractions with the environment (interventional data), but has also access to\na large collection of offline experiences, obtained by observing another agent\ninteracting with the environment (observational data). A key ingredient, that\nmakes this situation non-trivial, is that we allow the observed agent to\ninteract with the environment based on hidden information, which is not\nobserved by the learning agent. We then ask the following questions: can the\nonline and offline experiences be safely combined for learning a causal model ?\nAnd can we expect the offline experiences to improve the agent's performances ?\nTo answer these questions, we import ideas from the well-established causal\nframework of do-calculus, and we express model-based reinforcement learning as\na causal inference problem. Then, we propose a general yet simple methodology\nfor leveraging offline data during learning. In a nutshell, the method relies\non learning a latent-based causal transition model that explains both the\ninterventional and observational regimes, and then using the recovered latent\nvariable to infer the standard POMDP transition model via deconfounding.

    "title": "Modelling Monotonic and Non-Monotonic Attribute Dependencies with  Embeddings: A Theoretical Analysis",
    "abstract": "During the last decade, entity embeddings have become ubiquitous in\nArtificial Intelligence. Such embeddings essentially serve as compact but\nsemantically meaningful representations of the entities of interest. In most\napproaches, vectors are used for representing the entities themselves, as well\nas for representing their associated attributes. An important advantage of\nusing attribute embeddings is that (some of the) semantic dependencies between\nthe attributes can thus be captured. However, little is known about what kinds\nof semantic dependencies can be modelled in this way. The aim of this paper is\nto shed light on this question, focusing on settings where the embedding of an\nentity is obtained by pooling the embeddings of its known attributes. Our\nparticular focus is on studying the theoretical limitations of different\nembedding strategies, rather than their ability to effectively learn attribute\ndependencies in practice. We first show a number of negative results, revealing\nthat some of the most popular embedding models are not able to capture even\nbasic Horn rules. However, we also find that some embedding strategies are\ncapable, in principle, of modelling both monotonic and non-monotonic attribute\ndependencies.",

    "abstract": "Image matting is an ill-posed problem that aims to estimate the opacity of\nforeground pixels in an image. However, most existing deep learning-based\nmethods still suffer from the coarse-grained details. In general, these\nalgorithms are incapable of felicitously distinguishing the degree of\nexploration between deterministic domains (certain FG and BG pixels) and\nundetermined domains (uncertain in-between pixels), or inevitably lose\ninformation in the continuous sampling process, leading to a sub-optimal\nresult. In this paper, we propose a novel network named Prior-Induced\nInformation Alignment Matting Network (PIIAMatting), which can efficiently\nmodel the distinction of pixel-wise response maps and the correlation of\nlayer-wise feature maps. It mainly consists of a Dynamic Gaussian Modulation\nmechanism (DGM) and an Information Alignment strategy (IA). Specifically, the\nDGM can dynamically acquire a pixel-wise domain response map learned from the\nprior distribution. The response map can present the relationship between the\nopacity variation and the convergence process during training. On the other\nhand, the IA comprises an Information Match Module (IMM) and an Information\nAggregation Module (IAM), jointly scheduled to match and aggregate the adjacent\nlayer-wise features adaptively. Besides, we also develop a Multi-Scale\nRefinement (MSR) module to integrate multi-scale receptive field information at\nthe refinement stage to recover the fluctuating appearance details. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed\nPIIAMatting performs favourably against state-of-the-art image matting methods\non the Alphamatting.com, Composition-1K and Distinctions-646 dataset.",

    "abstract": "Perceiving and manipulating 3D articulated objects (e.g., cabinets, doors) in\nhuman environments is an important yet challenging task for future\nhome-assistant robots. The space of 3D articulated objects is exceptionally\nrich in their myriad semantic categories, diverse shape geometry, and\ncomplicated part functionality. Previous works mostly abstract kinematic\nstructure with estimated joint parameters and part poses as the visual\nrepresentations for manipulating 3D articulated objects. In this paper, we\npropose object-centric actionable visual priors as a novel\nperception-interaction handshaking point that the perception system outputs\nmore actionable guidance than kinematic structure estimation, by predicting\ndense geometry-aware, interaction-aware, and task-aware visual action\naffordance and trajectory proposals. We design an interaction-for-perception\nframework VAT-Mart to learn such actionable visual representations by\nsimultaneously training a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy\nexploring diverse interaction trajectories and a perception module summarizing\nand generalizing the explored knowledge for pointwise predictions among diverse\nshapes. Experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach using the\nlarge-scale PartNet-Mobility dataset in SAPIEN environment and show promising\ngeneralization capabilities to novel test shapes, unseen object categories, and\nreal-world data.

Despite having desirable properties from the viewpoint of game theory\nlike being contained in the core, the EA is in general hard to compute. Another\nwell-known method is given by Vickrey Payments (VP). Again, the VP have\ndesirable properties like coalitional rationality, the VP do not fulfill budget\nbalance in general and, thus, are not contained in the core in general. One\nattempt to overcome this shortcoming is to scale down the VP. This can be done\nby a unique scaling factor, or, by individual scaling factors. Now, the\nindividual scaled Vickrey Payments (ISV) are computed by maximizing the scaling\nfactors lexicographically. In this paper we show that the ISV payments are in\nfact identical to a weighted EA, thus exhibiting an interesting connection\nbetween EA and VP. With this, we conclude the uniqueness of the ISV payments\nand provide a polynomial time algorithm for computing a special weighted EA.",

    "abstract": "In the budget-feasible allocation problem, a set of items with varied sizes\nand values are to be allocated to a group of agents. Each agent has a budget\nconstraint on the total size of items she can receive. The goal is to compute a\nfeasible allocation that is envy-free (EF), in which the agents do not envy\neach other for the items they receive, nor do they envy a charity, who is\nendowed with all the unallocated items. Since EF allocations barely exist even\nwithout budget constraints, we are interested in the relaxed notion of\nenvy-freeness up to one item (EF1). The computation of both exact and\napproximate EF1 allocations remains largely open, despite a recent effort by Wu\net al. (IJCAI 2021) in showing that any budget-feasible allocation that\nmaximizes the Nash Social Welfare (NSW) is 1/4-approximate EF1. In this paper,\nwe move one step forward by showing that for agents with identical additive\nvaluations, a 1/2-approximate EF1 allocation can be computed in polynomial\ntime. For the uniform-budget and two-agent cases, we propose efficient\nalgorithms for computing an exact EF1 allocation. We also consider the large\nbudget setting, i.e., when the item sizes are infinitesimal compared with the\nagents' budgets, and show that both the NSW maximizing allocation and the\nallocation our polynomial-time algorithm computes have an approximation close\nto 1 regarding EF1.",

    "abstract": "Many objects commonly found in household and industrial environments are\nrepresented by cylindrical and cubic shapes. Thus, it is available for robots\nto manipulate them through the real-time detection of elliptic and rectangle\nshape primitives formed by the circular and rectangle tops of these objects. We\ndevise a robust grasping system that enables a robot to manipulate cylindrical\nand cubic objects in collaboration scenarios by the proposed perception\nstrategy including the detection of elliptic and rectangle shape primitives and\ndepth information. The proposed method of detecting ellipses and rectangles\nincorporates a one-stage detection backbone and then, accommodates the proposed\nadaptive multi-branch multi-scale net with a designed iterative feature pyramid\nnetwork, local inception net, and multi-receptive-filed feature fusion net to\ngenerate object detection recommendations. In terms of manipulating objects\nwith different shapes, we propose the grasp synthetic to align the grasp pose\nof the gripper with an object's pose based on the proposed detector and\nregistered depth information. The proposed robotic perception algorithm has\nbeen integrated on a robot to demonstrate the ability to carry out human-robot\ncollaborative manipulations of cylindrical and cubic objects in real-time. We\nshow that the robotic manipulator, empowered by the proposed detector, performs\nwell in practical manipulation scenarios.(An experiment video is available in\nYouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amcs8lwvNK8.)",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is a powerful technique for improving the performance of\nthe few-shot classification task. It generates more samples as supplements, and\nthen this task can be transformed into a common supervised learning issue for\nsolution. However, most mainstream data augmentation based approaches only\nconsider the single modality information, which leads to the low diversity and\nquality of generated features. In this paper, we present a novel multi-modal\ndata augmentation approach named Dizygotic Conditional Variational AutoEncoder\n(DCVAE) for addressing the aforementioned issue. DCVAE conducts feature\nsynthesis via pairing two Conditional Variational AutoEncoders (CVAEs) with the\nsame seed but different modality conditions in a dizygotic symbiosis manner.\nSubsequently, the generated features of two CVAEs are adaptively combined to\nyield the final feature, which can be converted back into its paired conditions\nwhile ensuring these conditions are consistent with the original conditions not\nonly in representation but also in function. DCVAE essentially provides a new\nidea of data augmentation in various multi-modal scenarios by exploiting the\ncomplement of different modality prior information. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate our work achieves state-of-the-art performances on\nminiImageNet, CIFAR-FS and CUB datasets, and is able to work well in the\npartial modality absence case.",

In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Busemann Learning.\nThe main idea behind our approach is to position prototypes on the ideal\nboundary of the Poincare ball, which does not require prior label knowledge. To\nbe able to compute proximities to ideal prototypes, we introduce the penalised\nBusemann loss. We provide theory supporting the use of ideal prototypes and the\nproposed loss by proving its equivalence to logistic regression in the\none-dimensional case.

However, in the two-stage detectors, due to the\nexcessive use of hand-crafted components, it is very difficult to reason about\nthe implicit relationship of the instance features. To tackle this problem, we\nanalyze three different levels of feature interaction relationships, namely,\nthe dependency relationship between the cropped local features and global\nfeatures, the feature autocorrelation within the instance, and the\ncross-correlation relationship between the instances. To this end, we propose a\nmore compact object detector head network (CODH), which can not only preserve\nglobal context information and condense the information density, but also\nallows instance-wise feature enhancement and relational reasoning in a larger\nmatrix space. Without bells and whistles, our method can effectively improve\nthe detection performance while significantly reducing the parameters of the\nmodel, e.g., with our method, the parameters of the head network is 0.6 times\nsmaller than the state-of-the-art Cascade R-CNN, yet the performance boost is\n1.3% on COCO test-dev.

Especially in\ncyber-physical environments, such as smart factories, gaining a reliable\npicture of the network can be, due to intertwining of a vast amount of devices\nand different protocols, a tedious task. Nevertheless, this work is necessary\nto conduct security audits, compare documentation with actual conditions or\nfound vulnerabilities using an attacker's view, for all of which a reliable\ntopology overview is pivotal. For security auditors, however, there might not\nmuch information, such as asset management access, be available beforehand,\nwhich is why this paper assumes network to audit as a complete black box. The\ngoal is therefore to set security auditors in a condition of, without having\nany a priori knowledge at all, automatically gaining a topology oversight. This\npaper describes, in the context of a bigger system that uses active scanning to\ndetermine the network topology, an approach to automate the first steps of this\nprocedure: passively scanning the network and determining the network's scope,\nas well as gaining a valid address to perform the active scanning.

This paper presents a study focused on\nOne-Touch-Gesture mobile games, with the aim of identifying the touch gestures\nused in popular games of this type, the types of in-game actions associated\nwith these gestures, and the interaction models used by these games. The study\nwas conducted by reviewing 77 of the most popular games in the last two years\nthrough playtesting by two researchers. The results of the study contribute to\nexisting knowledge by providing an insight into the interactions and actions of\npopular 1TG games and providing a guide to aid in developing games of the type.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous cars can reduce road traffic accidents and provide a safer mode of\ntransport. However, key technical challenges, such as safe navigation in\ncomplex urban environments, need to be addressed before deploying these\nvehicles on the market. Teleoperation can help smooth the transition from human\noperated to fully autonomous vehicles since it still has human in the loop\nproviding the scope of fallback on driver. This paper presents an Active Safety\nSystem (ASS) approach for teleoperated driving. The proposed approach helps the\noperator ensure the safety of the vehicle in complex environments, that is,\navoid collisions with static or dynamic obstacles. Our ASS relies on a model\npredictive control (MPC) formulation to control both the lateral and\nlongitudinal dynamics of the vehicle. By exploiting the ability of the MPC\nframework to deal with constraints, our ASS restricts the controller's\nauthority to intervene for lateral correction of the human operator's commands,\navoiding counter-intuitive driving experience for the human operator. Further,\nwe design a visual feedback to enhance the operator's trust over the ASS. In\naddition, we propose an MPC's prediction horizon data based novel predictive\ndisplay to mitigate the effects of large latency in the teleoperation system.\nWe tested the performance of the proposed approach on a high-fidelity vehicle\nsimulator in the presence of dynamic obstacles and latency.",

However, the\nidentification of these performant sparse neural networks (winning tickets)\neither involves a costly iterative train-prune-retrain process (e.g., Lottery\nTicket Hypothesis) or an over-extended sparse training time (e.g., Training\nwith Dynamic Sparsity), both of which would raise financial and environmental\nconcerns.

    "abstract": "Preserving privacy is a growing concern in our society where sensors and\ncameras are ubiquitous. In this work, for the first time, we propose a\ntrainable image acquisition method that removes the sensitive identity\nrevealing information in the optical domain before it reaches the image sensor.\nThe method benefits from a trainable optical convolution kernel which transmits\nthe desired information while filters out the sensitive content. As the\nsensitive content is suppressed before it reaches the image sensor, it does not\nenter the digital domain therefore is unretrievable by any sort of privacy\nattack. This is in contrast with the current digital privacy-preserving methods\nthat are all vulnerable to direct access attack. Also, in contrast with the\nprevious optical privacy-preserving methods that cannot be trained, our method\nis data-driven and optimized for the specific application at hand. Moreover,\nthere is no additional computation, memory, or power burden on the acquisition\nsystem since this processing happens passively in the optical domain and can\neven be used together and on top of the fully digital privacy-preserving\nsystems. The proposed approach is adaptable to different digital neural\nnetworks and content. We demonstrate it for several scenarios such as smile\ndetection as the desired attribute while the gender is filtered out as the\nsensitive content. We trained the optical kernel in conjunction with two\nadversarial neural networks where the analysis network tries to detect the\ndesired attribute and the adversarial network tries to detect the sensitive\ncontent. We show that this method can reduce 65.1% of sensitive content when it\nis selected to be the gender and it only loses 7.3% of the desired content.\nMoreover, we reconstruct the original faces using the deep reconstruction\nmethod that confirms the ineffectiveness of reconstruction attacks to obtain\nthe sensitive content.",

In some situations, the\nrelationship between the data and the decision is complex and/or the amount of\ndata to transmit is large (e.g. in biologgers). Artificial Neural Networks\n(ANNs) can efficiently detect patterns in the input data which makes them\nsuitable for decision making or compression of information for data\ntransmission. However, ANNs require a substantial amount of energy which\nreduces the lifetime of battery-powered devices. Therefore, the use of Spiking\nNeural Networks can improve such systems by providing a way to efficiently\nprocess sensory data without being too energy-consuming.

    "abstract": "When producing a model to object detection in a specific context, the first\nobstacle is to have a dataset labeling the desired classes. In RoboCup, some\nleagues already have more than one dataset to train and evaluate a model.\nHowever, in the Small Size League (SSL), there is not such dataset available\nyet. This paper presents an open-source dataset to be used as a benchmark for\nreal-time object detection in SSL. This work also presented a pipeline to\ntrain, deploy, and evaluate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models in a\nlow-power embedded system. This pipeline was used to evaluate the proposed\ndataset with state-of-art optimized models. In this dataset, the MobileNet SSD\nv1 achieves 44.88% AP (68.81% AP50) at 94 Frames Per Second (FPS) while running\non an SSL robot.",

    "abstract": "Interconnected computers and software systems have become an indispensable\npart of people's lives, therefore software quality research is becoming more\nand more important. There have been multiple attempts to synthesize knowledge\ngained in software quality research, however, they were focused mainly on\nsingle aspects of software quality and not to structure the knowledge in a\nholistic way. The aim of our study was to close this gap. The software quality\npublications were harvested from the Scopus bibliographic database. The\nmetadata was exported first to CRexlporer, which was employed to identify\nhistorical roots, and next to VOSViewer, which was used as a part of the\nsynthetic content analysis. In our study we defined synthetic context analysis\nas a triangulation of bibliometrics and content analysis. Our search resulted\nin 14451 publications. The performance bibliometric study showed that the\nproduction of research publications relating to software quality is currently\nfollowing an exponential growth trend and that the software quality research\ncommunity is growing. The most productive country was the United States and the\nmost productive Institution The Florida Atlantic University. The synthetic\ncontent analysis revealed that the published knowledge can be structured into\n10 themes, the most important being the themes regarding software quality\nimprovement with enhancing software engineering, advanced software testing, and\nimproved defect and fault prediction with machine learning and data mining.\nAccording to the analysis of the hot topics, it seems that future research will\nbe directed into developing and using a full specter of new artificial\nintelligence tools (not just machine learning and data mining) and focusing on\nhow to assure software quality in agile development paradigms.",

    "abstract": "A theory of language learning is described, which uses Bayesian induction of\nfeature structures (scripts) and script functions. Each word sense in a\nlanguage is mentally represented by an m-script, a script function which\nembodies all the syntax and semantics of the word. M-scripts form a\nfully-lexicalised unification grammar, which can support adult language. Each\nword m-script can be learnt robustly from about six learning examples. The\ntheory has been implemented as a computer model, which can bootstrap-learn a\nlanguage from zero vocabulary. The Bayesian learning mechanism is (1) Capable:\nto learn arbitrarily complex meanings and syntactic structures; (2) Fast:\nlearning these structures from a few examples each; (3) Robust: learning in the\npresence of much irrelevant noise, and (4) Self-repairing: able to acquire\nimplicit negative evidence, using it to learn exceptions. Children learning\nlanguage are clearly all of (1) - (4), whereas connectionist theories fail on\n(1) and (2), and symbolic theories fail on (3) and (4). The theory is in good\nagreement with many key facts of language acquisition, including facts which\nare problematic for other theories. It is compared with over 100 key\ncross-linguistic findings about acquisition of the lexicon, phrase structure,\nmorphology, complementation and control, auxiliaries, verb argument structures,\ngaps and movement - in nearly all cases giving unforced agreement without extra\nassumptions.",

PHED then couples the CVAE latent variables with the\nTransformer encoder and is trained by minimizing a newly derived ELBO and\ncontrolled losses to produce the next stage's input and produce responses as\nrequired. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations to show that PHED\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art neural generation models and\nproduces more diverse responses as expected.",

Convolutional neural\nnetworks are already common in computer vision models to process and extract\nrelationships in multidimensional data.

    "abstract": "The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of coronavirus outbreak caused\nby a novel virus called SARS-CoV-2. The sudden explosion and uncontrolled\nworldwide spread of COVID-19 show the limitations of existing healthcare\nsystems in timely handling public health emergencies. In such contexts,\ninnovative technologies such as blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nhave emerged as promising solutions for fighting coronavirus epidemic. In\nparticular, blockchain can combat pandemics by enabling early detection of\noutbreaks, ensuring the ordering of medical data, and ensuring reliable medical\nsupply chain during the outbreak tracing. Moreover, AI provides intelligent\nsolutions for identifying symptoms caused by coronavirus for treatments and\nsupporting drug manufacturing. Therefore, we present an extensive survey on the\nuse of blockchain and AI for combating COVID-19 epidemics. First, we introduce\na new conceptual architecture which integrates blockchain and AI for fighting\nCOVID-19. Then, we survey the latest research efforts on the use of blockchain\nand AI for fighting COVID-19 in various applications. The newly emerging\nprojects and use cases enabled by these technologies to deal with coronavirus\npandemic are also presented. A case study is also provided using federated AI\nfor COVID-19 detection. Finally, we point out challenges and future directions\nthat motivate more research efforts to deal with future coronavirus-like\nepidemics.",

In contrast to\nprevious works, our model tackles the case where there is uncertainty on the\nattributes characterizing the agents' data -- a critical aspect of the problem\nwhen the number of agents is large. We provide a characterization of the game's\nequilibrium, which reveals an interesting connection with optimal design.\nSubsequently, we focus on the asymptotic behavior of the covariance of the\nlinear regression parameters estimated via generalized least squares as the\nnumber of data sources becomes large. We provide upper and lower bounds for\nthis covariance matrix and we show that, when the agents' provision costs are\nsuperlinear, the model's covariance converges to zero but at a slower rate\nrelative to virtually all learning problems with exogenous data. On the other\nhand, if the agents' provision costs are linear, this covariance fails to\nconverge.

    "abstract": "We study privacy-utility trade-offs where users share privacy-correlated\nuseful information with a service provider to obtain some utility. The service\nprovider is adversarial in the sense that it can infer the users' private\ninformation based on the shared useful information. To minimize the privacy\nleakage while maintaining a desired level of utility, the users carefully\nperturb the useful information via a probabilistic privacy mapping before\nsharing it. We focus on the setting in which the adversary attempting an\ninference attack on the users' privacy has potentially biased information about\nthe statistical correlation between the private and useful variables. This\ninformation asymmetry between the users and the limited adversary leads to\nbetter privacy guarantees than the case of the omniscient adversary under the\nsame utility requirement. We first identify assumptions on the adversary's\ninformation so that the inference costs are well-defined and finite. Then, we\ncharacterize the impact of the information asymmetry and show that it increases\nthe inference costs for the adversary. We further formulate the design of the\nprivacy mapping against a limited adversary using a difference of convex\nfunctions program and solve it via the concave-convex procedure. When the\nadversary's information is not precisely available, we adopt a Bayesian view\nand represent the adversary's information by a probability distribution.

We present a novel\napproach to handle the alarm flooding problem faced by Cybersecurity systems\nlike security information and event management (SIEM) and intrusion detection\n(IDS). We apply a zero-shot learning method to machine learning (ML) by\nleveraging explanations for predictions of anomalies generated by a ML model.\nThis approach has huge potential to auto detect alarm labels generated in SIEM\nand associate them with specific attack types. In this approach, without any\nprior knowledge of attack, we try to identify it, decipher the features that\ncontribute to classification and try to bucketize the attack in a specific\ncategory - using explainable AI. Explanations give us measurable factors as to\nwhat features influence the prediction of a cyber-attack and to what degree.\nThese explanations generated based on game-theory are used to allocate credit\nto specific features based on their influence on a specific prediction. Using\nthis allocation of credit, we propose a novel zero-shot approach to categorize\nnovel attacks into specific new classes based on feature influence. The\nresulting system demonstrated will get good at separating attack traffic from\nnormal flow and auto-generate a label for attacks based on features that\ncontribute to the attack.

    "abstract": "As a new type of e-commerce platform developed in recent years, local\nconsumer service platform provides users with software to consume service to\nthe nearby store or to the home, such as Groupon and Koubei. Different from\nother common e-commerce platforms, the behavior of users on the local consumer\nservice platform is closely related to their real-time local context\ninformation. Therefore, building a context-aware user behavior prediction\nsystem is able to provide both merchants and users better service in local\nconsumer service platforms. However, most of the previous work just treats the\ncontextual information as an ordinary feature into the prediction model to\nobtain the prediction list under a specific context, which ignores the fact\nthat the interest of a user in different contexts is often significantly\ndifferent. Hence, in this paper, we propose a context-aware heterogeneous graph\nattention network (CHGAT) to dynamically generate the representation of the\nuser and to estimate the probability for future behavior. Specifically, we\nfirst construct the meta-path based heterogeneous graphs with the historical\nbehaviors from multiple sources and comprehend heterogeneous vertices in the\ngraph with a novel unified knowledge representing approach. Next, a multi-level\nattention mechanism is introduced for context-aware aggregation with graph\nvertices, which contains the vertex-level attention network and the path-level\nattention network. Both of them aim to capture the semantic correlation between\ninformation contained in the graph and the outside real-time contextual\ninformation in the search system.

Multi-fidelity\ndata fusion (MDF) methods aims to use massive LF samples and small amounts of\nHF samples to develop an accurate and efficient model for describing the system\nwith a reasonable computation burden. In this paper, we propose a novel\ngenerative adversarial network for MDF in digital twins (GAN-MDF).

The discriminator\nof GAN-MDF identifies whether the generator output is a real sample generated\nfrom HF model. To enhance the stability of GAN-MDF's training, we also\nintroduce the supervised-loss trick to refine the generator weights during each\niteration of the adversarial training.

    "abstract": "Regret has been established as a foundational concept in online learning, and\nlikewise has important applications in the analysis of learning dynamics in\ngames. Regret quantifies the difference between a learner's performance against\na baseline in hindsight. It is well-known that regret-minimizing algorithms\nconverge to certain classes of equilibria in games; however, traditional forms\nof regret used in game theory predominantly consider baselines that permit\ndeviations to deterministic actions or strategies. In this paper, we revisit\nour understanding of regret from the perspective of deviations over partitions\nof the full \\emph{mixed} strategy space (i.e., probability distributions over\npure strategies), under the lens of the previously-established $\\Phi$-regret\nframework, which provides a continuum of stronger regret measures. Importantly,\n$\\Phi$-regret enables learning agents to consider deviations from and to mixed\nstrategies, generalizing several existing notions of regret such as external,\ninternal, and swap regret, and thus broadening the insights gained from\nregret-based analysis of learning algorithms. We prove here that the\nwell-studied evolutionary learning algorithm of replicator dynamics (RD)\nseamlessly minimizes the strongest possible form of $\\Phi$-regret in generic $2\n\\times 2$ games, without any modification of the underlying algorithm itself.\nWe subsequently conduct experiments validating our theoretical results in a\nsuite of 144 $2 \\times 2$ games wherein RD exhibits a diverse set of behaviors.\nWe conclude by providing empirical evidence of $\\Phi$-regret minimization by RD\nin some larger games, hinting at further opportunity for $\\Phi$-regret based\nstudy of such algorithms from both a theoretical and empirical perspective.",

    "abstract": "As edge devices become prevalent, deploying Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on\nedge devices has become a critical issue. However, DNN requires a high\ncomputational resource which is rarely available for edge devices. To handle\nthis, we propose a novel model compression method for the devices with limited\ncomputational resources, called PQK consisting of pruning, quantization, and\nknowledge distillation (KD) processes. Unlike traditional pruning and KD, PQK\nmakes use of unimportant weights pruned in the pruning process to make a\nteacher network for training a better student network without pre-training the\nteacher model. PQK has two phases. Phase 1 exploits iterative pruning and\nquantization-aware training to make a lightweight and power-efficient model. In\nphase 2, we make a teacher network by adding unimportant weights unused in\nphase 1 to a pruned network. By using this teacher network, we train the pruned\nnetwork as a student network. In doing so, we do not need a pre-trained teacher\nnetwork for the KD framework because the teacher and the student networks\ncoexist within the same network. We apply our method to the recognition model\nand verify the effectiveness of PQK on keyword spotting (KWS) and image\nrecognition.",

    "title": "Anticipatory routing methods for an on-demand ridepooling mobility  system",
    "abstract": "One of the most relevant challenges regarding on-demand ridepooling relates\nto the spatial imbalances of the demand, which induce a mismatch between the\nposition of the vehicles and the origins of the emerging requests. Most\nridepooling models face this problem through rebalancing methods only, i.e.,\nmoving idle vehicles towards areas with high rejections rate, which is done\nindependently from routing and vehicle-to-orders assignments, so that vehicles\nserving passengers (a large portion of the total fleet) remain unaffected. This\npaper introduces two types of techniques for anticipatory routing that affect\nhow vehicles are assigned to users and how to route vehicles to serve such\nusers, so that the whole operation of the system is modified to reach more\nefficient states for future requests. Both techniques do not require any\nassumption or exogenous knowledge about the future demand, as they depend only\non current and recent requests. Firstly, we introduce rewards that reduce the\ncost of an assignment between a vehicle and a group of passengers if the\nvehicle gets routed towards a high-demand zone. Secondly, we include a small\nset of artificial requests, whose request times are in the near future and\nwhose origins are sampled from a probability distribution that mimics observed\ngeneration rates. These artificial requests are to be assigned together with\nthe real requests.\nWe test these techniques using a set of real rides from Manhattan.\nIntroducing rewards can diminish the rejection rate to about nine-tenths of its\noriginal value. On the other hand, including future requests can reduce users'\ntraveling times by about one-fifth, but increasing rejections. Both methods\nincrease the vehicles-hour-traveled by about 10%. Spatial analysis reveals that\nvehicles are indeed moved towards the most demanded areas, such that the\nreduction in rejections rate is achieved mostly there.",

We\npropose a novel human-swarm interaction system, allowing the user to control\nswarm position and formation by either direct hand motion or by trajectory\ndrawing with a hand gesture interface based on the DNN gesture recognition. The\nkey technology of the SwarmPaint is the user's ability to perform various tasks\nwith the swarm without additional devices by switching between interaction\nmodes. Two types of interaction were proposed and developed to adjust a swarm\nbehavior: free-form trajectory generation control and shaped formation control.\nTwo preliminary user studies were conducted to explore user's performance and\nsubjective experience from human-swarm interaction through the developed\ncontrol modes. The experimental results revealed a sufficient accuracy in the\ntrajectory tracing task (mean error of 5.6 cm by gesture draw and 3.1 cm by\nmouse draw with the pattern of dimension 1 m by 1 m) over three evaluated\ntrajectory patterns and up to 7.3 cm accuracy in targeting task with two target\npatterns of 1 m achieved by SwarmPaint interface.

    "abstract": "Multimodal image alignment is the process of finding spatial correspondences\nbetween images formed by different imaging techniques or under different\nconditions, to facilitate heterogeneous data fusion and correlative analysis.\nThe information-theoretic concept of mutual information (MI) is widely used as\na similarity measure to guide multimodal alignment processes, where most works\nhave focused on local maximization of MI that typically works well only for\nsmall displacements; this points to a need for global maximization of MI, which\nhas previously been computationally infeasible due to the high run-time\ncomplexity of existing algorithms. We propose an efficient algorithm for\ncomputing MI for all discrete displacements (formalized as the cross-mutual\ninformation function (CMIF)), which is based on cross-correlation computed in\nthe frequency domain. We show that the algorithm is equivalent to a direct\nmethod while asymptotically superior in terms of run-time. Furthermore, we\npropose a method for multimodal image alignment for transformation models with\nfew degrees of freedom (e.g. rigid) based on the proposed CMIF-algorithm. We\nevaluate the efficacy of the proposed method on three distinct benchmark\ndatasets, of aerial images, cytological images, and histological images, and we\nobserve excellent success-rates (in recovering known rigid transformations),\noverall outperforming alternative methods, including local optimization of MI\nas well as several recent deep learning-based approaches. We also evaluate the\nrun-times of a GPU implementation of the proposed algorithm and observe\nspeed-ups from 100 to more than 10,000 times for realistic image sizes compared\nto a GPU implementation of a direct method.

This work investigates four questions, including how cyber security\nculture is defined, what factors are essential to building and maintaining such\na culture, the frameworks proposed to cultivate a security culture and the\nmetrics suggested to assess it. Through the application of the PRISMA\nsystematic literature review technique, we identify and analyse 58 research\narticles from the last 10 years (2010-2020). Our findings demonstrate that\nwhile there have been notable changes in the use of terms (e.g., information\nsecurity culture and cyber security culture), many of the most influential\nfactors across papers are similar. Top management support, policy and\nprocedures, and awareness for instance, are critical in engendering cyber\nsecurity culture. Many of the frameworks reviewed revealed common foundations,\nwith organisational culture playing a substantial role in crafting appropriate\ncyber security culture models. Questionnaires and surveys are the most used\ntool to measure cyber security culture, but there are also concerns as to\nwhether more dynamic measures are needed. For practitioners, this article\nhighlights factors and models essential to the creation and management of a\nrobust security culture.

However, the existing ML based\ndetection has low detection accuracy and low throughput incurred by inefficient\ntraffic features extraction. Thus, they cannot detect attacks in realtime\nespecially in high throughput networks.

While the model has shown promise on tasks in several areas,\nit has not always been clear when the results were cherry-picked or when they\nwere the unvarnished output. We were particularly interested in what benefits\nGPT-3 could bring to the SemEval 2021 MeasEval task - identifying measurements\nand their associated attributes in scientific literature. We had already\nexperimented with multi-turn questions answering as a solution to this task. We\nwanted to see if we could use GPT-3's few-shot learning capabilities to more\neasily develop a solution that would have better performance than our prior\nwork. Unfortunately, we have not been successful in that effort. This paper\ndiscusses the approach we used, challenges we encountered, and results we\nobserved. Some of the problems we encountered were simply due to the state of\nthe art. For example, the limits on the size of the prompt and answer limited\nthe amount of the training signal that could be offered. Others are more\nfundamental. We are unaware of generative models that excel in retaining\nfactual information. Also, the impact of changes in the prompts is\nunpredictable, making it hard to reliably improve performance.",

Only the\nsemantic skeleton representation is transmitted over the network and raw images\nremain on the sensor board. 3D poses are recovered from 2D joints on a central\nbackend, based on triangulation and a body model which incorporates prior\nknowledge of the human skeleton. A feedback channel from backend to individual\nsensors is implemented on a semantic level. The allocentric 3D pose is\nbackprojected into the sensor views where it is fused with 2D joint detections.\nThe local semantic model on each sensor can thus be improved by incorporating\nglobal context information. The whole pipeline is capable of real-time\noperation. We evaluate our method on three public datasets, where we achieve\nstate-of-the-art results and show the benefits of our feedback architecture, as\nwell as in our own setup for multi-person experiments.

Smart walkers are a commonly used solution that should embed\nautomatic and objective tools for data-driven human-in-the-loop control and\nmonitoring. However, present solutions focus on extracting few specific metrics\nfrom dedicated sensors with no unified full-body approach. We investigate a\ngeneral, real-time, full-body pose estimation framework based on two RGB+D\ncamera streams with non-overlapping views mounted on a smart walker equipment\nused in rehabilitation. Human keypoint estimation is performed using a\ntwo-stage neural network framework. The 2D-Stage implements a detection module\nthat locates body keypoints in the 2D image frames. The 3D-Stage implements a\nregression module that lifts and relates the detected keypoints in both cameras\nto the 3D space relative to the walker. Model predictions are low-pass filtered\nto improve temporal consistency. A custom acquisition method was used to obtain\na dataset, with 14 healthy subjects, used for training and evaluating the\nproposed framework offline, which was then deployed on the real walker\nequipment. An overall keypoint detection error of 3.73 pixels for the 2D-Stage\nand 44.05mm for the 3D-Stage were reported, with an inference time of 26.6ms\nwhen deployed on the constrained hardware of the walker. We present a novel\napproach to patient monitoring and data-driven human-in-the-loop control in the\ncontext of smart walkers.

Balance control has been thoroughly studied for simple\nmodels such as the linear inverted pendulum thanks to the concept of the\ninstantaneous capture point (ICP), yet the constant center of mass height\nassumption limits the application. This paper explores balancing of the\nvariable-height inverted pendulum (VHIP) model by introducing the\n\\emph{instantaneous capture input} (ICI), an extension of the ICP based on its\nkey properties.

Although\nintuitive, such a native label assignment strategy cannot reveal the underlying\nsemantic similarity between a query and its positives and negatives, and\nimpairs performance, since some negatives are semantically similar to the query\nor even share the same semantic class as the query. In this work, we first\nprove that for contrastive learning, inaccurate label assignment heavily\nimpairs its generalization for semantic instance discrimination, while accurate\nlabels benefit its generalization. Inspired by this theory, we propose a novel\nself-labeling refinement approach for contrastive learning. It improves the\nlabel quality via two complementary modules: (i) self-labeling refinery (SLR)\nto generate accurate labels and (ii) momentum mixup (MM) to enhance similarity\nbetween query and its positive. SLR uses a positive of a query to estimate\nsemantic similarity between a query and its positive and negatives, and\ncombines estimated similarity with vanilla label assignment in contrastive\nlearning to iteratively generate more accurate and informative soft labels. We\ntheoretically show that our SLR can exactly recover the true semantic labels of\nlabel-corrupted data, and supervises networks to achieve zero prediction error\non classification tasks.

Recently,\nultra-wideband (UWB) radios emerged as a more accurate alternative that\nnonetheless exhibits a significantly higher energy consumption, limiting\nin-field studies. In this paper, we leverage a novel approach, embodied by the\nJanus system that combines these radios by exploiting their complementary\nbenefits.

    "abstract": "Differentially private algorithms protect individuals in data analysis\nscenarios by ensuring that there is only a weak correlation between the\nexistence of the user in the data and the result of the analysis. Dynamic graph\nalgorithms maintain the solution to a problem (e.g., a matching) on an evolving\ninput, i.e., a graph where nodes or edges are inserted or deleted over time.\nThey output the value of the solution after each update operation, i.e.,\ncontinuously. We study (event-level and user-level) differentially private\nalgorithms for graph problems under continual observation, i.e., differentially\nprivate dynamic graph algorithms. We present event-level private algorithms for\npartially dynamic counting-based problems such as triangle count that improve\nthe additive error by a polynomial factor (in the length $T$ of the update\nsequence) on the state of the art, resulting in the first algorithms with\nadditive error polylogarithmic in $T$.\nWe also give $\\varepsilon$-differentially private and partially dynamic\nalgorithms for minimum spanning tree, minimum cut, densest subgraph, and\nmaximum matching. The additive error of our improved MST algorithm is $O(W\n\\log^{3/2}T / \\varepsilon)$, where $W$ is the maximum weight of any edge,\nwhich, as we show, is tight up to a $(\\sqrt{\\log T} / \\varepsilon)$-factor. For\nthe other problems, we present a partially-dynamic algorithm with\nmultiplicative error $(1+\\beta)$ for any constant $\\beta > 0$ and additive\nerror $O(W \\log(nW) \\log(T) / (\\varepsilon \\beta) )$. Finally, we show that the\nadditive error for a broad class of dynamic graph algorithms with user-level\nprivacy must be linear in the value of the output solution's range.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) could be very useful in blockchain applications\nsuch as DeFi and NFT trading. However, training / running large-scale DNNs as\npart of a smart contract is infeasible on today's blockchain platforms, due to\ntwo fundamental design issues of these platforms. First, blockchains nowadays\ntypically require that each node maintain the complete world state at any time,\nmeaning that the node must execute all transactions in every block. This is\nprohibitively expensive for computationally intensive smart contracts involving\nDNNs. Second, existing blockchain platforms expect smart contract transactions\nto have deterministic, reproducible results and effects. In contrast, DNNs are\nusually trained / run lock-free on massively parallel computing devices such as\nGPUs, TPUs and / or computing clusters, which often do not yield deterministic\nresults.\nThis paper proposes novel platform designs, collectively called A New Hope\n(ANH), that address the above issues. The main ideas are (i)\ncomputing-intensive smart contract transactions are only executed by nodes who\nneed their results, or by specialized serviced providers, and (ii) a\nnon-deterministic smart contract transaction leads to uncertain results, which\ncan still be validated, though at a relatively high cost; specifically for\nDNNs, the validation cost can often be reduced by verifying properties of the\nresults instead of their exact values. In addition, we discuss various\nimplications of ANH, including its effects on token fungibility, sharding,\nprivate transactions, and the fundamental meaning of a smart contract.",

    "abstract": "While state-of-the-art development in CNN topology, such as VGGNet and\nResNet, have become increasingly accurate, these networks are computationally\nexpensive involving billions of arithmetic operations and parameters. To\nimprove the classification accuracy, state-of-the-art CNNs usually involve\nlarge and complex convolutional layers. However, for certain applications, e.g.\nInternet of Things (IoT), where such CNNs are to be implemented on\nresource-constrained platforms, the CNN architectures have to be small and\nefficient. To deal with this problem, reducing the resource consumption in\nconvolutional layers has become one of the most significant solutions. In this\nwork, a multi-objective optimisation approach is proposed to trade-off between\nthe amount of computation and network accuracy by using Multi-Objective\nEvolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). The number of convolution kernels and the size\nof these kernels are proportional to computational resource consumption of\nCNNs. Therefore, this paper considers optimising the computational resource\nconsumption by reducing the size and number of kernels in convolutional layers.\nAdditionally, the use of unconventional kernel shapes has been investigated and\nresults show these clearly outperform the commonly used square convolution\nkernels. The main contributions of this paper are therefore a methodology to\nsignificantly reduce computational cost of CNNs, based on unconventional kernel\nshapes, and provide different trade-offs for specific use cases. The\nexperimental results further demonstrate that the proposed method achieves\nlarge improvements in resource consumption with no significant reduction in\nnetwork performance. Compared with the benchmark CNN, the best trade-off\narchitecture shows a reduction in multiplications of up to 6X and with slight\nincrease in classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset.",

In this direction, in our previous works we\npresented a framework for representing (contextualized) OWL RL knowledge bases\nwith a notion of justified exceptions on defeasible axioms: reasoning in such\nframework is realized by a translation into ASP programs.

The\nlimited form of $\\textit{DL-Lite}_{\\cal R}$ axioms allows us to formulate a\nsimpler ASP encoding, where reasoning on negative information is managed by\ndirect rules.

Traditional models usually conduct feature\nmining from a single perspective, with the features mined being limited and the\ninternal relationships between them being ignored. Consequently, useful\nfeatures are lost and classification results are unsatisfactory. To fully mine\nand utilize image features, a new multi-scale feature-mining learning algorithm\n(MGRNet) is proposed. The model uses principal component analysis to reduce the\ndimensionality of the original hyperspectral image (HSI) to retain 99.99% of\nits semantic information and extract dimensionality reduction features. Using a\nmulti-scale convolution algorithm, the input dimensionality reduction features\nwere mined to obtain shallow features, which then served as inputs into a\nmulti-scale graph convolution algorithm to construct the internal relationships\nbetween eigenvalues at different scales. We then carried out cross fusion of\nmulti-scale information obtained by graph convolution, before inputting the new\ninformation obtained into the residual network algorithm for deep feature\nmining.

Yet,\ndespite its simplicity, the LA is not as popular as alternatives like\nvariational Bayes or deep ensembles. This may be due to assumptions that the LA\nis expensive due to the involved Hessian computation, that it is difficult to\nimplement, or that it yields inferior results. In this work we show that these\nare misconceptions: we (i) review the range of variants of the LA including\nversions with minimal cost overhead; (ii) introduce \"laplace\", an easy-to-use\nsoftware library for PyTorch offering user-friendly access to all major flavors\nof the LA; and (iii) demonstrate through extensive experiments that the LA is\ncompetitive with more popular alternatives in terms of performance, while\nexcelling in terms of computational cost. We hope that this work will serve as\na catalyst to a wider adoption of the LA in practical deep learning, including\nin domains where Bayesian approaches are not typically considered at the\nmoment.",

When those particles are anisotropic, the\naddition of a particle orientation vector to the kinetic description yields a\n$2d-1$ dimensional theory which becomes intractable to simulate, especially in\nthree dimensions or near states where the particles are highly aligned.\nCoarse-grained theories that track only moments of the particle distribution\nfunctions provide a more efficient simulation framework, but require closure\nassumptions. For the particular case where the particles are apolar, the\nBingham closure has been found to agree well with the underlying kinetic\ntheory; yet the closure is non-trivial to compute, requiring the solution of an\noften nearly-singular nonlinear equation at every spatial discretization point\nat every timestep. In this paper, we present a robust, accurate, and efficient\nnumerical scheme for evaluating the Bingham closure, with a controllable\nerror/efficiency tradeoff. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we carry\nout high-resolution simulations of a coarse-grained continuum model for a\nsuspension of active particles in parameter regimes inaccessible to kinetic\ntheories. Analysis of these simulations reveals that inaccurately computing the\nclosure can act to effectively limit spatial resolution in the coarse-grained\nfields.

As such, using a\nwell-structured dataset that has minimum level of bias is always desirable. In\nthis paper, we proposed a novel, domain-independent approach, called\nscore-based resampling (SBR), to locate the under-represented samples of the\noriginal training dataset based on the model prediction scores obtained with\nthat training set. In our method, once trained, we use the same CNN model to\ninfer on its own training samples, obtain prediction scores, and based on the\ndistance between predicted and ground-truth, we identify samples that are far\naway from their ground-truth and augment them in the original training set. The\ntemperature term of the Sigmoid function is decreased to better differentiate\nscores. For experimental evaluation, we selected one Kaggle dataset for gender\nclassification. We first used a CNN-based classifier with relatively standard\nstructure, trained on the training images, and evaluated on the provided\nvalidation samples of the original dataset. Then, we assessed it on a totally\nnew test dataset consisting of light male, light female, dark male, and dark\nfemale groups. The obtained accuracies varied, revealing the existence of\ncategorical bias against certain groups in the original dataset. Subsequently,\nwe trained the model after resampling based on our proposed approach. We\ncompared our method with a previously proposed variational autoencoder (VAE)\nbased algorithm. The obtained results confirmed the validity of our proposed\nmethod regrading identifying under-represented samples among original dataset\nto decrease categorical bias of classifying certain groups.

    "abstract": "Episode discovery from an event is a popular framework for data mining tasks\nand has many real-world applications. An episode is a partially ordered set of\nobjects (e.g., item, node), and each object is associated with an event type.\nThis episode can also be considered as a complex event sub-sequence.\nHigh-utility episode mining is an interesting utility-driven mining task in the\nreal world. Traditional episode mining algorithms, by setting a threshold,\nusually return a huge episode that is neither intuitive nor saves time. In\ngeneral, finding a suitable threshold in a pattern-mining algorithm is a\ntrivial and time-consuming task. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm,\ncalled Top-K High Utility Episode (THUE) mining within the complex event\nsequence, which redefines the previous mining task by obtaining the K highest\nepisodes. We introduce several threshold-raising strategies and optimize the\nepisode-weighted utilization upper bounds to speed up the mining process and\neffectively reduce the memory cost. Finally, the experimental results on both\nreal-life and synthetic datasets reveal that the THUE algorithm can offer six\nto eight orders of magnitude running time performance improvement over the\nstate-of-the-art algorithm and has low memory consumption.",

The\nhybrid zonotope is shown to be equivalent to $2^N$ constrained zonotopes\nthrough the addition of $N$ binary zonotope factors and is well-suited for the\nanalysis of hybrid systems with both continuous and discrete states and inputs.\nThe major contribution of this manuscript is a closed-form solution for exact\nforward reachable sets of linear mixed logical dynamical systems. This is given\nby a simple identity and does not require solving any optimization programs or\ntaking set approximations. The proposed approach captures the worst-case\nexponential growth in the number of convex sets required to represent the\nnonconvex reachable set of a hybrid system while exhibiting only linear growth\nin the complexity of the hybrid zonotope set representation. To reduce both set\nrepresentation complexity and the computational burden of reachability\nanalysis, a binary tree is used to store only the combinations of binary\nfactors of the hybrid zonotope that map to nonempty convex sets. The proposed\napproach is applied to an established benchmark example where the exact\nreachable set of a discrete-time hybrid system with six continuous and two\ndiscrete states is given by a single hybrid zonotope equivalent to the union of\n657 constrained zonotopes, and is represented using only 283 continuous\nfactors, 29 binary factors, and 177 linear equality constraints.

For an arbitrary\npolynomial degree $p$, we show that the resulting coefficient matrices possess\na Toeplitz-like structure. We investigate their spectral properties via their\nsymbol and we prove that, like for second order differential problems, also in\nthis case the given matrices are ill-conditioned both in the low and high\nfrequencies for large $p$. More precisely, in the fractional scenario the\nsymbol has a single zero at $0$ of order $\\alpha$, with $\\alpha$ the fractional\nderivative order that ranges from $1$ to $2$, and it presents an exponential\ndecay to zero at $\\pi$ for increasing $p$ that becomes faster as $\\alpha$\napproaches $1$. This translates in a mitigated conditioning in the low\nfrequencies and in a deterioration in the high frequencies when compared to\nsecond order problems. Furthermore, the derivation of the symbol reveals\nanother similarity of our problem with a classical diffusion problem. Since the\nentries of the coefficient matrices are defined as evaluations of fractional\nderivatives of the B-spline basis at the collocation points, we are able to\nexpress the central entries of the coefficient matrix as inner products of two\nfractional derivatives of cardinal B-splines. Finally, we perform a numerical\nstudy of the approximation behavior of polynomial B-spline collocation.

    "abstract": "Representations of the world environment play a crucial role in machine\nintelligence. It is often inefficient to conduct reasoning and inference\ndirectly in the space of raw sensory representations, such as pixel values of\nimages. Representation learning allows us to automatically discover suitable\nrepresentations from raw sensory data. For example, given raw sensory data, a\nmultilayer perceptron learns nonlinear representations at its hidden layers,\nwhich are subsequently used for classification (or regression) at its output\nlayer. This happens implicitly during training through minimizing a supervised\nor unsupervised loss. In this paper, we study the dynamics of such implicit\nnonlinear representation learning. We identify a pair of a new assumption and a\nnovel condition, called the common model structure assumption and the\ndata-architecture alignment condition. Under the common model structure\nassumption, the data-architecture alignment condition is shown to be sufficient\nfor the global convergence and necessary for the global optimality. Our results\nprovide practical guidance for designing a model structure: e.g., the common\nmodel structure assumption can be used as a justification for using a\nparticular model structure instead of others. As an application, we then derive\na new training framework, which satisfies the data-architecture alignment\ncondition without assuming it by automatically modifying any given training\nalgorithm dependently on each data and architecture. Given a standard training\nalgorithm, the framework running its modified version is empirically shown to\nmaintain competitive (practical) test performances while providing global\nconvergence guarantees for ResNet-18 with convolutions, skip connections, and\nbatch normalization with standard benchmark datasets, including MNIST,\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Semeion, KMNIST and SVHN.",

    "abstract": "Low-prior targets are common among many important clinical events, which\nintroduces the challenge of having enough data to support learning of their\npredictive models. Many prior works have addressed this problem by first\nbuilding a general patient-state representation model, and then adapting it to\na new low-prior prediction target. In this schema, there is potential for the\npredictive performance to be hindered by the misalignment between the general\npatient-state model and the target task. To overcome this challenge, we propose\na new method that simultaneously optimizes a shared model through multi-task\nlearning of both the low-prior supervised target and general purpose\npatient-state representation (GPSR). More specifically, our method improves\nprediction performance of a low-prior task by jointly optimizing a shared model\nthat combines the loss of the target event and a broad range of generic\nclinical events. We study the approach in the context of Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNNs). Through extensive experiments on multiple clinical event\ntargets using MIMIC-III data, we show that the inclusion of general\npatient-state representation tasks during model training improves the\nprediction of individual low-prior targets.",

    "abstract": "Iris presentation attack detection (PAD) plays a vital role in iris\nrecognition systems. Most existing CNN-based iris PAD solutions 1) perform only\nbinary label supervision during the training of CNNs, serving global\ninformation learning but weakening the capture of local discriminative\nfeatures, 2) prefer the stacked deeper convolutions or expert-designed\nnetworks, raising the risk of overfitting, 3) fuse multiple PAD systems or\nvarious types of features, increasing difficulty for deployment on mobile\ndevices. Hence, we propose a novel attention-based deep pixel-wise binary\nsupervision (A-PBS) method. Pixel-wise supervision is first able to capture the\nfine-grained pixel/patch-level cues. Then, the attention mechanism guides the\nnetwork to automatically find regions that most contribute to an accurate PAD\ndecision. Extensive experiments are performed on LivDet-Iris 2017 and three\nother publicly available databases to show the effectiveness and robustness of\nproposed A-PBS methods. For instance, the A-PBS model achieves an HTER of 6.50%\non the IIITD-WVU database outperforming state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Data poisoning has been proposed as a compelling defense against facial\nrecognition models trained on Web-scraped pictures. By perturbing the images\nthey post online, users can fool models into misclassifying future\n(unperturbed) pictures. We demonstrate that this strategy provides a false\nsense of security, as it ignores an inherent asymmetry between the parties:\nusers' pictures are perturbed once and for all before being published (at which\npoint they are scraped) and must thereafter fool all future models -- including\nmodels trained adaptively against the users' past attacks, or models that use\ntechnologies discovered after the attack. We evaluate two systems for poisoning\nattacks against large-scale facial recognition, Fawkes (500,000+ downloads) and\nLowKey. We demonstrate how an \"oblivious\" model trainer can simply wait for\nfuture developments in computer vision to nullify the protection of pictures\ncollected in the past. We further show that an adversary with black-box access\nto the attack can (i) train a robust model that resists the perturbations of\ncollected pictures and (ii) detect poisoned pictures uploaded online. We\ncaution that facial recognition poisoning will not admit an \"arms race\" between\nattackers and defenders.

    "abstract": "An important challenge in reinforcement learning is training agents that can\nsolve a wide variety of tasks. If tasks depend on each other (e.g. needing to\nlearn to walk before learning to run), curriculum learning can speed up\nlearning by focusing on the next best task to learn. We explore curriculum\nlearning in a complex, visual domain with many hard exploration challenges:\nMinecraft. We find that learning progress (defined as a change in success\nprobability of a task) is a reliable measure of learnability for automatically\nconstructing an effective curriculum. We introduce a learning-progress based\ncurriculum and test it on a complex reinforcement learning problem (called\n\"Simon Says\") where an agent is instructed to obtain a desired goal item. Many\nof the required skills depend on each other. Experiments demonstrate that: (1)\na within-episode exploration bonus for obtaining new items improves\nperformance, (2) dynamically adjusting this bonus across training such that it\nonly applies to items the agent cannot reliably obtain yet further increases\nperformance, (3) the learning-progress based curriculum elegantly follows the\nlearning curve of the agent, and (4) when the learning-progress based\ncurriculum is combined with the dynamic exploration bonus it learns much more\nefficiently and obtains far higher performance than uniform baselines. These\nresults suggest that combining intra-episode and across-training exploration\nbonuses with learning progress creates a promising method for automated\ncurriculum generation, which may substantially increase our ability to train\nmore capable, generally intelligent agents.",

We\nthen train a new two-layer codec avatar with separate modeling of the upper\nclothing and the inner body layer. To learn the interaction between the body\ndynamics and clothing states, we use a temporal convolution network to predict\nthe clothing latent code based on a sequence of input skeletal poses. We show\nphotorealistic animation output for three different actors, and demonstrate the\nadvantage of our clothed-body avatars over single-layer avatars in the previous\nwork.

    "abstract": "Vision transformer (ViT) models exhibit substandard optimizability. In\nparticular, they are sensitive to the choice of optimizer (AdamW vs. SGD),\noptimizer hyperparameters, and training schedule length. In comparison, modern\nconvolutional neural networks are far easier to optimize. Why is this the case?\nIn this work, we conjecture that the issue lies with the patchify stem of ViT\nmodels, which is implemented by a stride-p pxp convolution (p=16 by default)\napplied to the input image. This large-kernel plus large-stride convolution\nruns counter to typical design choices of convolutional layers in neural\nnetworks. To test whether this atypical design choice causes an issue, we\nanalyze the optimization behavior of ViT models with their original patchify\nstem versus a simple counterpart where we replace the ViT stem by a small\nnumber of stacked stride-two 3x3 convolutions. While the vast majority of\ncomputation in the two ViT designs is identical, we find that this small change\nin early visual processing results in markedly different training behavior in\nterms of the sensitivity to optimization settings as well as the final model\naccuracy. Using a convolutional stem in ViT dramatically increases optimization\nstability and also improves peak performance (by ~1-2% top-1 accuracy on\nImageNet-1k), while maintaining flops and runtime. The improvement can be\nobserved across the wide spectrum of model complexities (from 1G to 36G flops)\nand dataset scales (from ImageNet-1k to ImageNet-21k).

By introducing the inductive bias from the image processing,\nconvolution neural network (CNN) has achieved excellent performance in numerous\ncomputer vision tasks and has been established as \\emph{de facto} backbone. In\nrecent years, inspired by the great success achieved by Transformer in NLP\ntasks, vision Transformer models emerge. Using much less inductive bias, they\nhave achieved promising performance in computer vision tasks compared with\ntheir CNN counterparts. More recently, researchers investigate using the\npure-MLP architecture to build the vision backbone to further reduce the\ninductive bias, achieving good performance. The pure-MLP backbone is built upon\nchannel-mixing MLPs to fuse the channels and token-mixing MLPs for\ncommunications between patches. In this paper, we re-think the design of the\ntoken-mixing MLP. We discover that token-mixing MLPs in existing MLP-based\nbackbones are spatial-specific, and thus it is sensitive to spatial\ntranslation. Meanwhile, the channel-agnostic property of the existing\ntoken-mixing MLPs limits their capability in mixing tokens. To overcome those\nlimitations, we propose an improved structure termed as Circulant\nChannel-Specific (CCS) token-mixing MLP, which is spatial-invariant and\nchannel-specific.

While a careless imposition of local\nboundary conditions leads to a smaller effective material stiffness close to\nthe boundary and an artificial softening of the material, several strategies\nwere proposed to avoid this unphysical surface effect.\nIn this work, we study convergence of solutions to nonlocal state-based\nlinear elastic model to their local counterparts as the interaction horizon\nvanishes, under different formulations and smoothness assumptions for nonlocal\nDirichlet-type boundary conditions. Our results provide explicit rates of\nconvergence that are sensitive to the compatibility of the nonlocal boundary\ndata and the extension of the solution for the local model. In particular,\nunder appropriate assumptions, constant extensions yield $\\frac{1}{2}$ order\nconvergence rates and linear extensions yield $\\frac{3}{2}$ order convergence\nrates. With smooth extensions, these rates are improved to quadratic\nconvergence. We illustrate the theory for any dimension $d\\geq 2$ and\nnumerically verify the convergence rates with a number of two dimensional\nbenchmarks, including linear patch tests, manufactured solutions, and domains\nwith curvilinear surfaces. Numerical results show a first order convergence for\nconstant extensions and second order convergence for linear extensions, which\nsuggests a possible room of improvement in the future convergence analysis.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized optimization, particularly the class of decentralized composite\nconvex optimization (DCCO) problems, has found many applications. Due to\nubiquitous communication congestion and random dropouts in practice, it is\nhighly desirable to design decentralized algorithms that can handle stochastic\ncommunication networks. However, most existing algorithms for DCCO only work in\ntime-invariant networks and cannot be extended to stochastic networks because\nthey inherently need knowledge of network topology $\\textit{a priori}$. In this\npaper, we propose a new decentralized dual averaging (DDA) algorithm that can\nsolve DCCO in stochastic networks. Under a rather mild condition on stochastic\nnetworks, we show that the proposed algorithm attains $\\textit{global linear\nconvergence}$ if each local objective function is strongly convex. Our\nalgorithm substantially improves the existing DDA-type algorithms as the latter\nwere only known to converge $\\textit{sublinearly}$ prior to our work. The key\nto achieving the improved rate is the design of a novel dynamic averaging\nconsensus protocol for DDA, which intuitively leads to more accurate local\nestimates of the global dual variable. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first linearly convergent DDA-type decentralized algorithm and also the\nfirst algorithm that attains global linear convergence for solving DCCO in\nstochastic networks. Numerical results are also presented to support our design\nand analysis.",

These implicit approaches do not fully exploit the\nposition information (i.e. absolute location) of targets.

Particularly, motivated by image moments, the\nsegmentation prediction map and ground-truth map are weighted by coordinate\ninformation.

    "abstract": "Accelerating multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a new and\neffective solution for fast MR imaging, providing superior performance in\nrestoring the target modality from its undersampled counterpart with guidance\nfrom an auxiliary modality. However, existing works simply introduce the\nauxiliary modality as prior information, lacking in-depth investigations on the\npotential mechanisms for fusing two modalities. Further, they usually rely on\nthe convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which focus on local information and\nprevent them from fully capturing the long-distance dependencies of global\nknowledge. To this end, we propose a multi-modal transformer (MTrans), which is\ncapable of transferring multi-scale features from the target modality to the\nauxiliary modality, for accelerated MR imaging. By restructuring the\ntransformer architecture, our MTrans gains a powerful ability to capture deep\nmulti-modal information. More specifically, the target modality and the\nauxiliary modality are first split into two branches and then fused using a\nmulti-modal transformer module. This module is based on an improved multi-head\nattention mechanism, named the cross attention module, which absorbs features\nfrom the auxiliary modality that contribute to the target modality. Our\nframework provides two appealing benefits: (i) MTrans is the first attempt at\nusing improved transformers for multi-modal MR imaging, affording more global\ninformation compared with CNN-based methods. (ii) A new cross attention module\nis proposed to exploit the useful information in each branch at different\nscales. It affords both distinct structural information and subtle pixel-level\ninformation, which supplement the target modality effectively.",

    "title": "A stochastic model of grain boundary dynamics: A Fokker-Planck  perspective",
    "abstract": "Many technologically useful materials are polycrystals composed of small\nmonocrystalline grains that are separated by grain boundaries of crystallites\nwith different lattice orientations. The energetics and connectivities of the\ngrain boundaries play an essential role in defining the effective properties of\nmaterials across multiple scales. In this paper we derive a Fokker-Planck model\nfor the evolution of the planar grain boundary network. The proposed model\nconsiders anisotropic grain boundary energy which depends on lattice\nmisorientation and takes into account mobility of the triple junctions, as well\nas independent dynamics of the misorientations. We establish long time\nasymptotics of the Fokker-Planck solution, namely the joint probability density\nfunction of misorientations and triple junctions, and closely related the\nmarginal probability density of misorientations. Moreover, for an equilibrium\nconfiguration of a boundary network, we derive explicit local algebraic\nrelations, a generalized Herring Condition formula, as well as formula that\nconnects grain boundary energy density with the geometry of the grain\nboundaries that share a triple junction. Although the stochastic model neglects\nthe explicit interactions and correlations among triple junctions, the\nconsidered specific form of the noise, under the fluctuation-dissipation\nassumption, provides partial information about evolution of a grain boundary\nnetwork, and is consistent with presented results of extensive grain growth\nsimulations.",

    "title": "Using deep learning to detect patients at risk for prostate cancer  despite benign biopsies",
    "abstract": "Background: Transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsies of the prostate\nis a routine procedure to establish a prostate cancer diagnosis. However, the\n10-12 prostate core biopsies only sample a relatively small volume of the\nprostate, and tumour lesions in regions between biopsy cores can be missed,\nleading to a well-known low sensitivity to detect clinically relevant cancer.\nAs a proof-of-principle, we developed and validated a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork model to distinguish between morphological patterns in benign prostate\nbiopsy whole slide images from men with and without established cancer.\nMethods: This study included 14,354 hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide\nimages from benign prostate biopsies from 1,508 men in two groups: men without\nan established prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and men with at least one core\nbiopsy diagnosed with PCa. 80% of the participants were assigned as training\ndata and used for model optimization (1,211 men), and the remaining 20% (297\nmen) as a held-out test set used to evaluate model performance. An ensemble of\n10 deep convolutional neural network models was optimized for classification of\nbiopsies from men with and without established cancer. Hyperparameter\noptimization and model selection was performed by cross-validation in the\ntraining data . Results: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(ROC-AUC) was estimated as 0.727 (bootstrap 95% CI: 0.708-0.745) on biopsy\nlevel and 0.738 (bootstrap 95% CI: 0.682 - 0.796) on man level. At a\nspecificity of 0.9 the model had an estimated sensitivity of 0.348. Conclusion:\nThe developed model has the ability to detect men with risk of missed PCa due\nto under-sampling of the prostate. The proposed model has the potential to\nreduce the number of false negative cases in routine systematic prostate\nbiopsies and to indicate men who could benefit from MRI-guided re-biopsy.",

    "abstract": "Implicitly filtered Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is by nature numerically\nunder-resolved. With the sole exception of Fourier-spectral methods, discrete\nnumerical derivative operators cannot accurately represent the dynamics of all\nof the represented scales. Since the resolution scale in an LES usually lies in\nthe inertial range, these poorly represented scales are dynamically significant\nand errors in their dynamics can affect all resolved scales. This Letter is\nfocused on characterizing the effects of numerical dispersion error by studying\nthe energy cascade in LES of convecting homogeneous isotropic turbulence.\nNumerical energy and transfer spectra reveal that energy is not transferred at\nthe appropriate rate to wavemodes where significant dispersion error is\npresent. This leads to a deficiency of energy in highly dispersive modes and an\naccompanying pile up of energy in the well resolved modes, since dissipation by\nthe subgrid model is diminished. An asymptotic analysis indicates that\ndispersion error causes a phase decoherence between triad interacting\nwavemodes, leading to a reduction in the mean energy transfer rate for these\nscales. These findings are relevant to a wide range of LES, since turbulence\ncommonly convects through the grid in practical simulations. Further, these\nresults indicate that the resolved scales should be defined through an explicit\nfilter so that the dispersive modes will not be energized.",

We define a notion of quantum Solovay randomness and\nshow it to be equivalent to q-MLR using purely linear algebraic methods.\nQuantum Schnorr randomness is then introduced. A quantum analogue of the law of\nlarge numbers is shown to hold for quantum Schnorr random states. We introduce\nquantum-K, ($QK$) a measure of the descriptive complexity of density matrices\nusing classical prefix-free Turing machines and show that the initial segments\nof weak Solovay random and quantum Schnorr random states are incompressible in\nthe sense of $QK$. Several connections between Solovay randomness and $K$ carry\nover to those between weak Solovay randomness and $QK$. We then define $QK_C$,\nusing computable measure machines and connect it to quantum Schnorr randomness.\nWe then explore a notion of `measuring' a state. We formalize how `measurement'\nof a state induces a probability measure on the space of infinite bitstrings. A\nstate is `measurement random' ($mR$) if the measure induced by it, under any\ncomputable basis, assigns probability one to the set of Martin-L\\\"of randoms.\nI.e., measuring a $mR$ state produces a Martin-L\\\"of random bitstring almost\nsurely. While quantum-Martin-L\\\"of random states are $mR$, the converse fails:\nthere is a $mR$ state, $\\rho$ which is not quantum-Martin-L\\\"of random. In\nfact, something stronger is true. While $\\rho$ is computable and can be easily\nconstructed, measuring it in any computable basis yields an arithmetically\nrandom sequence with probability one.

    "abstract": "In order to objectively assess new medical imaging technologies via\ncomputer-simulations, it is important to account for all sources of variability\nthat contribute to image data. One important source of variability that can\nsignificantly limit observer performance is associated with the variability in\nthe ensemble of objects to-be-imaged. This source of variability can be\ndescribed by stochastic object models (SOMs), which are generative models that\ncan be employed to sample from a distribution of to-be-virtually-imaged\nobjects. It is generally desirable to establish SOMs from experimental imaging\nmeasurements acquired by use of a well-characterized imaging system, but this\ntask has remained challenging. Deep generative neural networks, such as\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) hold potential for such tasks. To\nestablish SOMs from imaging measurements, an AmbientGAN has been proposed that\naugments a GAN with a measurement operator. However, the original AmbientGAN\ncould not immediately benefit from modern training procedures and GAN\narchitectures, which limited its ability to be applied to realistically sized\nmedical image data. To circumvent this, in this work, a modified AmbientGAN\ntraining strategy is proposed that is suitable for modern progressive or\nmulti-resolution training approaches such as employed in the Progressive\nGrowing of GANs and Style-based GANs. AmbientGANs established by use of the\nproposed training procedure are systematically validated in a controlled way by\nuse of computer-simulated measurement data corresponding to a stylized imaging\nsystem. Finally, emulated single-coil experimental magnetic resonance imaging\ndata are employed to demonstrate the methods under less stylized conditions.",

In the early stage, the disease manifests itself in most cases with\nerythema migrans (EM) skin lesions. Better diagnosis of these early forms would\nallow improving the prognosis by preventing the transition to a severe late\nform thanks to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Recent studies show that\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform very well to identify skin lesions\nfrom the image but, there is not much work for Lyme disease prediction from EM\nlesion images. The main objective of this study is to extensively analyze the\neffectiveness of CNNs for diagnosing Lyme disease from images and to find out\nthe best CNN architecture for the purpose. There is no publicly available EM\nimage dataset for Lyme disease prediction mainly because of privacy concerns.\nIn this study, we utilized an EM dataset consisting of images collected from\nClermont-Ferrand University Hospital Center (CF-CHU) of France and the\ninternet. CF-CHU collected the images from several hospitals in France. This\ndataset was labeled by expert dermatologists and infectiologists from CF-CHU.\nFirst, we benchmarked this dataset for twenty-three well-known CNN\narchitectures in terms of predictive performance metrics, computational\ncomplexity metrics, and statistical significance tests. Second, to improve the\nperformance of the CNNs, we used transfer learning from ImageNet pre-trained\nmodels as well as pre-trained the CNNs with the skin lesion dataset \"Human\nAgainst Machine with 10000 training images (HAM1000)\". In that process, we\nsearched for the best performing number of layers to unfreeze during transfer\nlearning fine-tuning for each of the CNNs. Third, for model explainability, we\nutilized Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping to visualize the regions of\ninput that are significant to the CNNs for making predictions.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the distributed algorithm design for general smooth\nnon-convex finite-sum optimization, which has wide applications in signal\nprocessing and machine learning communities. In distributed setting, large\nnumber of samples are allocated to multiple agents in the network. Each agent\ncomputes local stochastic gradient and communicates with its neighbors to seek\nfor the global optimum. In this paper, we develop a modified variance reduction\nscheme to deal with the variance by stochastic gradients. Combining gradient\ntracking and variance reduction schemes, this paper proposes a distributed\niterative algorithm, GT-VR, to solve large-scale non-convex finite-sum\noptimization over multi-agent networks. A complete and rigorous proof shows\nthat the GT-VR algorithm converges to first-order stationary points with\n$O(\\frac{1}{k})$ convergence rate. In addition, we provide the complexity\nanalysis of the proposed algorithm. Compared with some existing distributed\nalgorithms, the proposed algorithm has lower iteration and communication\ncomplexity. Experimental results of state-of-the-art algorithms and GT-VR\nverify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm by making comparison.",

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nis clinically relevant in diagnoses, prognoses and surgery treatment, which\nrequires multiple modalities to provide complementary morphological and\nphysiopathologic information. However, missing modality commonly occurs due to\nimage corruption, artifacts, different acquisition protocols or allergies to\ncertain contrast agents in clinical practice. Though existing efforts\ndemonstrate the possibility of a unified model for all missing situations, most\nof them perform poorly when more than one modality is missing. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Adversarial Co-training Network (ACN) to solve this issue,\nin which a series of independent yet related models are trained dedicated to\neach missing situation with significantly better results. Specifically, ACN\nadopts a novel co-training network, which enables a coupled learning process\nfor both full modality and missing modality to supplement each other's domain\nand feature representations, and more importantly, to recover the `missing'\ninformation of absent modalities. Then, two unsupervised modules, i.e., entropy\nand knowledge adversarial learning modules are proposed to minimize the domain\ngap while enhancing prediction reliability and encouraging the alignment of\nlatent representations, respectively. We also adapt modality-mutual information\nknowledge transfer learning to ACN to retain the rich mutual information among\nmodalities.

Using input convex neural networks, the\nmodels are hyperelastic, anisotropic and fulfill the polyconvexity condition,\nwhich implies ellipticity and thus ensures material stability.

A moderate amount of calibration data\nis used, based on deformations which are commonly applied in experimental\ninvestigations. While the invariant-based model shows drawbacks for several\ndeformation modes, the model based on the deformation gradient alone is able to\nreproduce and predict the effective material behavior very well and exhibits\nexcellent generalization capabilities.

One of the data\npre-treatment techniques commonly used is outliers detection. The so-called\n3${\\sigma}$ method is a common practice to identify the outliers. As shown in\nthe manuscript, it does not identify all outliers, resulting in possible\ndistortion of the overall statistics of the data. This problem can have a\nsignificant impact on further data analysis and can lead to reduction in the\naccuracy of predictive models. There is a plethora of various techniques for\noutliers detection, however, aside from theoretical work, they all require case\nstudy work. Two types of outliers were considered: short-term (erroneous data,\nnoise) and long-term outliers (e.g. malfunctioning for longer periods). The\ndata used were taken from the vacuum distillation unit (VDU) of an Asian\nrefinery and included 40 physical sensors (temperature, pressure and flow\nrate). We used a modified method for 3${\\sigma}$ thresholds to identify the\nshort-term outliers, i.e. ensors data are divided into chunks determined by\nchange points and 3${\\sigma}$ thresholds are calculated within each chunk\nrepresenting near-normal distribution. We have shown that piecewise 3${\\sigma}$\nmethod offers a better approach to short-term outliers detection than\n3${\\sigma}$ method applied to the entire time series. Nevertheless, this does\nnot perform well for long-term outliers (which can represent another state in\nthe data). In this case, we used principal component analysis (PCA) with\nHotelling's $T^2$ statistics to identify the long-term outliers. The results\nobtained with PCA were subject to DBSCAN clustering method. The outliers (which\nwere visually obvious and correctly detected by the PCA method) were also\ncorrectly identified by DBSCAN which supported the consistency and accuracy of\nthe PCA method.",

Despite comprehensive\nempirical evidence that it overall outperforms nuclear norm minimization and\nrelated methods, it is still not understood to a satisfying degree. In\nparticular, the significance of a slow decrease of the therein appearing\nregularization parameter denoted $\\gamma$ poses interesting questions.

We expand on local convergence theorems, now with\nan emphasis on the decline of $\\gamma$, and provide representative examples as\nwell as counterexamples such as a diverging $\\mathrm{IRLS}$-$0$ sequence that\nclarify theoretical limits. We present a data sparse, alternating realization\n$\\mathrm{AIRLS}$-$p$ (related to prior work under the name $\\mathrm{SALSA}$)\nthat, along with the rest of this work, serves as basis and introduction to the\nmore general tensor setting. In conclusion, numerical sensitivity experiments\nare carried out that reconfirm the success of $\\mathrm{IRLS}$-$0$ and\ndemonstrate that in surprisingly many cases, a slower decay of $\\gamma$ will\nyet lead to a solution of the ARM problem, up to the point that the exact\ntheoretical phase transition for generic recoverability can be observed.\nLikewise, this suggests that non-convexity is less substantial and problematic\nfor the log-det approach than it might initially appear.",

Our results demonstrate the profitability of\nglobal information with an increase of accuracy from 72.2% to 84.8%.",

    "title": "Tiled sparse coding in eigenspaces for the COVID-19 diagnosis in chest  X-ray images",
    "abstract": "The ongoing crisis of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has\nchanged the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 4 million\npeople have died due to this disease, whereas there have been more than 180\nmillion confirmed cases of COVID-19. The collapse of the health system in many\ncountries has demonstrated the need of developing tools to automatize the\ndiagnosis of the disease from medical imaging. Previous studies have used deep\nlearning for this purpose. However, the performance of this alternative highly\ndepends on the size of the dataset employed for training the algorithm. In this\nwork, we propose a classification framework based on sparse coding in order to\nidentify the pneumonia patterns associated with different pathologies.\nSpecifically, each chest X-ray (CXR) image is partitioned into different tiles.\nThe most relevant features extracted from PCA are then used to build the\ndictionary within the sparse coding procedure. Once images are transformed and\nreconstructed from the elements of the dictionary, classification is performed\nfrom the reconstruction errors of individual patches associated with each\nimage. Performance is evaluated in a real scenario where simultaneously\ndifferentiation between four different pathologies: control vs bacterial\npneumonia vs viral pneumonia vs COVID-19. The accuracy when identifying the\npresence of pneumonia is 93.85%, whereas 88.11% is obtained in the 4-class\nclassification context. The excellent results and the pioneering use of sparse\ncoding in this scenario evidence the applicability of this approach as an aid\nfor clinicians in a real-world environment.",

    "title": "Clarifying How Degree Entropies and Degree-Degree Correlations Relate to  Network Robustness",
    "abstract": "It is often claimed that the entropy of a network's degree distribution is a\nproxy for its robustness. Here, we clarify the link between degree distribution\nentropy and giant component robustness to node removal by showing that the\nformer merely sets a lower bound to the latter for randomly configured networks\nwhen no other network characteristics are specified. Furthermore, we show that,\nfor networks of fixed expected degree that follow degree distributions of the\nsame form, the relation between degree distribution entropy and robustness is\nnot a functional one. By contrast, there is evidence that the relation between\nremaining degree entropy and robustness is, in this case, a functional one. We\nalso show that degree-degree correlations, contrary to what is generally\nassumed, are not by themselves indicative of a network's robustness. We\nintroduce two new algorithms: one that reconfigures a network such that it is\ndisassortative and has a low robustness, and another that swaps the edges in a\nnetwork while preserving the network's joint degree distribution. We present\ncomputed entropies and robustness (as measured by critical fraction) for many\nartificial and real-world networks to illustrate our results.",

    "title": "Dynamic Planning and Learning under Recovering Rewards",
    "abstract": "Motivated by emerging applications such as live-streaming e-commerce,\npromotions and recommendations, we introduce a general class of multi-armed\nbandit problems that have the following two features: (i) the decision maker\ncan pull and collect rewards from at most $K$ out of $N$ different arms in each\ntime period; (ii) the expected reward of an arm immediately drops after it is\npulled, and then non parametrically recovers as the idle time increases. With\nthe objective of maximizing expected cumulative rewards over $T$ time periods,\nwe propose, construct and prove performance guarantees for a class of \"Purely\nPeriodic Policies\". For the offline problem when all model parameters are\nknown, our proposed policy obtains an approximation ratio that is at the order\nof $1-\\mathcal O(1/\\sqrt{K})$, which is asymptotically optimal when $K$ grows\nto infinity. For the online problem when the model parameters are unknown and\nneed to be learned, we design an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) based policy that\napproximately has $\\widetilde{\\mathcal O}(N\\sqrt{T})$ regret against the\noffline benchmark. Our framework and policy design may have the potential to be\nadapted into other offline planning and online learning applications with\nnon-stationary and recovering rewards.",

    "title": "Progressive Joint Low-light Enhancement and Noise Removal for Raw Images",
    "abstract": "Low-light imaging on mobile devices is typically challenging due to\ninsufficient incident light coming through the relatively small aperture,\nresulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the previous works on\nlow-light image processing focus either only on a single task such as\nillumination adjustment, color enhancement, or noise removal; or on a joint\nillumination adjustment and denoising task that heavily relies on short-long\nexposure image pairs collected from specific camera models, and thus these\napproaches are less practical and generalizable in real-world settings where\ncamera-specific joint enhancement and restoration is required. To tackle this\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a low-light image processing framework that\nperforms joint illumination adjustment, color enhancement, and denoising.\nConsidering the difficulty in model-specific data collection and the ultra-high\ndefinition of the captured images, we design two branches: a coefficient\nestimation branch as well as a joint enhancement and denoising branch. The\ncoefficient estimation branch works in a low-resolution space and predicts the\ncoefficients for enhancement via bilateral learning, whereas the joint\nenhancement and denoising branch works in a full-resolution space and performs\njoint enhancement and denoising in a progressive manner. In contrast to\nexisting methods, our framework does not need to recollect massive data when\nbeing adapted to another camera model, which significantly reduces the efforts\nrequired to fine-tune our approach for practical usage. Through extensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate its great potential in real-world low-light imaging\napplications when compared with current state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the \"inverse bandit\" problem of estimating the rewards of a\nmulti-armed bandit instance from observing the learning process of a low-regret\ndemonstrator. Existing approaches to the related problem of inverse\nreinforcement learning assume the execution of an optimal policy, and thereby\nsuffer from an identifiability issue. In contrast, our paradigm leverages the\ndemonstrator's behavior en route to optimality, and in particular, the\nexploration phase, to obtain consistent reward estimates. We develop simple and\nefficient reward estimation procedures for demonstrations within a class of\nupper-confidence-based algorithms, showing that reward estimation gets\nprogressively easier as the regret of the algorithm increases. We match these\nupper bounds with information-theoretic lower bounds that apply to any\ndemonstrator algorithm, thereby characterizing the optimal tradeoff between\nexploration and reward estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on both\nsynthetic data and simulated experimental design data from the natural sciences\ncorroborate our theoretical results.",
