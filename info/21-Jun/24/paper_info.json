Our goal is to provide an overview of\ndiverse types of explanations and human limitations, and discuss implications\nfor collecting and using explanations in NLP. Inspired by prior work in\npsychology and cognitive sciences, we group existing human explanations in NLP\ninto three categories: proximal mechanism, evidence, and procedure. These three\ntypes differ in nature and have implications for the resultant explanations.\nFor instance, procedure is not considered explanations in psychology and\nconnects with a rich body of work on learning from instructions. The diversity\nof explanations is further evidenced by proxy questions that are needed for\nannotators to interpret and answer open-ended why questions.

    "abstract": "While representation learning has yielded a great success on many graph\nlearning tasks, there is little understanding behind the structures that are\nbeing captured by these embeddings. For example, we wonder if the topological\nfeatures, such as the Triangle Count, the Degree of the node and other\ncentrality measures are concretely encoded in the embeddings. Furthermore, we\nask if the presence of these structures in the embeddings is necessary for a\nbetter performance on the downstream tasks, such as clustering and\nclassification. To address these questions, we conduct an extensive empirical\nstudy over three classes of unsupervised graph embedding models and seven\ndifferent variants of Graph Autoencoders. Our results show that five\ntopological features: the Degree, the Local Clustering Score, the Betweenness\nCentrality, the Eigenvector Centrality, and Triangle Count are concretely\npreserved in the first layer of the graph autoencoder that employs the SUM\naggregation rule, under the condition that the model preserves the second-order\nproximity. We supplement further evidence for the presence of these features by\nrevealing a hierarchy in the distribution of the topological features in the\nembeddings of the aforementioned model. We also show that a model with such\nproperties can outperform other models on certain downstream tasks, especially\nwhen the preserved features are relevant to the task at hand.

A second trend is HPC machines' growing complexity, with increasing\nheterogeneous hardware components and different clusters architectures\ncooperating in the same machine. We refer to these environments with the term\nheterogeneous multi-cluster environments. With the aim of optimizing\nperformance and energy consumption in these environments, this paper proposes\nan Energy-Aware-Multi-Cluster (EAMC) job scheduling policy. EAMC-policy is able\nto optimize the scheduling and placement of jobs by predicting performance and\nenergy consumption of arriving jobs for different hardware architectures and\nprocessor frequencies, reducing workload's energy consumption, makespan, and\nresponse time. The policy assigns a different priority to each job-resource\ncombination so that the most efficient ones are favored, while less efficient\nones are still considered on a variable degree, reducing response time and\nincreasing cluster utilization. We implemented EAMC-policy in Slurm, and we\nevaluated a scenario in which two CPU clusters collaborate in the same machine.\nSimulations of workloads running applications modeled from real-world show a\nreduction of response time and makespan by up to 25% and 6% while saving up to\n20% of total energy consumed when compared to policies minimizing runtime, and\nby 49%, 26%, and 6% compared to policies minimizing energy.",

These approaches, called Non-local\nmulti-continua, are proposed for problems with complex spatial heterogeneities\nin a number of previous papers. In this paper, we extend this approach for\nspace-time heterogeneities, by identifying macroscopic parameters in space-time\nregions. Our proposed method space-time Non-local multi-continua (space-time\nNLMC) is an efficient numerical solver to deal with time-dependent\nheterogeneous coefficients. It provides a flexible and systematic way to\nconstruct multiscale basis functions to approximate the solution. These\nmultiscale basis functions are constructed by solving a local energy\nminimization problems in the oversampled space-time regions such that these\nmultiscale basis functions decay exponentially outside the oversampled domain.\nUnlike the classical time-stepping methods combined with full-discretization\ntechnique, our space-time NLMC efficiently constructs the multiscale basis\nfunctions in a space-time domain and can provide a computational savings\ncompared to space-only approaches as we discuss in the paper.

To this\nend, we note that pyramid pooling has been demonstrated to be effective in\nvarious vision tasks owing to its powerful context abstraction, and its natural\nproperty of spatial invariance is suitable to address the loss of structural\ninformation (problem ii)).

    "abstract": "Adversarial input detection has emerged as a prominent technique to harden\nDeep Neural Networks(DNNs) against adversarial attacks. Most prior works use\nneural network-based detectors or complex statistical analysis for adversarial\ndetection. These approaches are computationally intensive and vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks. To this end, we propose DetectX - a hardware friendly\nadversarial detection mechanism using hardware signatures like Sum of column\nCurrents (SoI) in memristive crossbars (XBar). We show that adversarial inputs\nhave higher SoI compared to clean inputs. However, the difference is too small\nfor reliable adversarial detection. Hence, we propose a dual-phase training\nmethodology: Phase1 training is geared towards increasing the separation\nbetween clean and adversarial SoIs; Phase2 training improves the overall\nrobustness against different strengths of adversarial attacks. For\nhardware-based adversarial detection, we implement the DetectX module using\n32nm CMOS circuits and integrate it with a Neurosim-like analog crossbar\narchitecture. We perform hardware evaluation of the Neurosim+DetectX system on\nthe Neurosim platform using datasets-CIFAR10(VGG8), CIFAR100(VGG16) and\nTinyImagenet(ResNet18). Our experiments show that DetectX is 10x-25x more\nenergy efficient and immune to dynamic adversarial attacks compared to previous\nstate-of-the-art works.

    "abstract": "Multi-action restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) are a powerful framework\nfor constrained resource allocation in which $N$ independent processes are\nmanaged. However, previous work only study the offline setting where problem\ndynamics are known. We address this restrictive assumption, designing the first\nalgorithms for learning good policies for Multi-action RMABs online using\ncombinations of Lagrangian relaxation and Q-learning. Our first approach,\nMAIQL, extends a method for Q-learning the Whittle index in binary-action RMABs\nto the multi-action setting. We derive a generalized update rule and\nconvergence proof and establish that, under standard assumptions, MAIQL\nconverges to the asymptotically optimal multi-action RMAB policy as\n$t\\rightarrow{}\\infty$. However, MAIQL relies on learning Q-functions and\nindexes on two timescales which leads to slow convergence and requires problem\nstructure to perform well. Thus, we design a second algorithm, LPQL, which\nlearns the well-performing and more general Lagrange policy for multi-action\nRMABs by learning to minimize the Lagrange bound through a variant of\nQ-learning. To ensure fast convergence, we take an approximation strategy that\nenables learning on a single timescale, then give a guarantee relating the\napproximation's precision to an upper bound of LPQL's return as\n$t\\rightarrow{}\\infty$.

Such methods achieve\nimpressive performance but require large amounts of labeled training data. This\nparadigm entangles two separable subproblems: (1) decomposing a shape into\nregions and (2) assigning semantic labels to these regions. We claim that\ndisentangling these subproblems reduces the labeled data burden: (1) region\ndecomposition requires no semantic labels and could be performed in an\nunsupervised fashion, and (2) labeling shape regions instead of atoms results\nin a smaller search space and should be learnable with less labeled training\ndata. In this paper, we investigate this second claim by presenting the\nNeurally-Guided Shape Parser (NGSP), a method that learns how to assign\nsemantic labels to regions of an over-segmented 3D shape. We solve this problem\nvia MAP inference, modeling the posterior probability of a labeling assignment\nconditioned on an input shape. We employ a Monte Carlo importance sampling\napproach guided by a neural proposal network, a search-based approach made\nfeasible by assuming the input shape is decomposed into discrete regions. We\nevaluate NGSP on the task of hierarchical semantic segmentation on manufactured\n3D shapes from PartNet. We find that NGSP delivers significant performance\nimprovements over baselines that learn to label shape atoms and then aggregate\npredictions for each shape region, especially in low-data regimes.

    "title": "Strategic Liquidity Provision in Uniswap v3",
    "abstract": "Uniswap is the largest decentralized exchange for digital currencies. The\nnewest version, called Uniswap v3, allows liquidity providers to allocate\nliquidity to one or more closed intervals of the price of an asset, instead of\nover the total range of prices. While the price of the asset remains in that\ninterval, the liquidity provider earns rewards proportionally to the amount of\nliquidity allocated. This induces the problem of strategic liquidity provision:\nsmaller intervals result in higher concentration of liquidity and\ncorrespondingly larger rewards when the price remains in the interval, but with\nhigher risk. We formalize this problem and study three classes of strategies\nfor liquidity providers: uniform, proportional, and optimal (via a constrained\noptimization problem). We present experimental results based on the historical\nprice data of Ethereum, which show that simple liquidity provision strategies\ncan yield near-optimal utility and earn over 200x more than Uniswap v2\nliquidity provision.",

Here, we present an MMdA (Measure-based\nMultimodal deep learning (DL)-driven Assembly) method allowing for end-to-end\nOMR processing from various images including inclined photo images. Using this\nmethod, measures are extracted by a deep learning model, aligned, and resized\nto be used for inference of given musical symbol components by using multiple\ndeep learning models in sequence or in parallel. Use of each standardized\nmeasure enables efficient training of the models and accurate adjustment of\nfive staff lines in each measure. Multiple musical symbol component category\nmodels with a small number of feature types can represent a diverse set of\nnotes and other musical symbols including chords.

    "abstract": "Neural volume rendering became increasingly popular recently due to its\nsuccess in synthesizing novel views of a scene from a sparse set of input\nimages. So far, the geometry learned by neural volume rendering techniques was\nmodeled using a generic density function. Furthermore, the geometry itself was\nextracted using an arbitrary level set of the density function leading to a\nnoisy, often low fidelity reconstruction. The goal of this paper is to improve\ngeometry representation and reconstruction in neural volume rendering. We\nachieve that by modeling the volume density as a function of the geometry. This\nis in contrast to previous work modeling the geometry as a function of the\nvolume density. In more detail, we define the volume density function as\nLaplace's cumulative distribution function (CDF) applied to a signed distance\nfunction (SDF) representation. This simple density representation has three\nbenefits: (i) it provides a useful inductive bias to the geometry learned in\nthe neural volume rendering process; (ii) it facilitates a bound on the opacity\napproximation error, leading to an accurate sampling of the viewing ray.\nAccurate sampling is important to provide a precise coupling of geometry and\nradiance; and (iii) it allows efficient unsupervised disentanglement of shape\nand appearance in volume rendering. Applying this new density representation to\nchallenging scene multiview datasets produced high quality geometry\nreconstructions, outperforming relevant baselines.

Such is the case\nfor head overcoat (HOC) thickness measurements in the magnetic hard disk drive\nindustry. It is therefore necessary to develop software to automatically\nmeasure HOC thickness. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a HOC\nlayer segmentation method using NASNet-Large as an encoder and then followed by\na decoder architecture, which is one of the most commonly used architectures in\ndeep learning for image segmentation.

The main challenge in using randomized\npreconditioning is the need for an underlying iterative method, thus randomized\npreconditioning so far have been applied almost exclusively to solving\nregression problems and linear systems. In this article, we show how to expand\nthe application of randomized preconditioning to another important set of\nproblems prevalent across data science: optimization problems with\n(generalized) orthogonality constraints. We demonstrate our approach, which is\nbased on the framework of Riemannian optimization and Riemannian\npreconditioning, on the problem of computing the dominant canonical\ncorrelations and on the Fisher linear discriminant analysis problem. For both\nproblems, we evaluate the effect of preconditioning on the computational costs\nand asymptotic convergence, and demonstrate empirically the utility of our\napproach.",

To help with their problems, we collected and\nanalyzed physiological and behavioral wearable sensor data from shift working\nnurses and doctors, as well as their behavioral questionnaire data and their\nself-reported daily health and wellbeing labels, including alertness,\nhappiness, energy, health, and stress. We found the similarities and\ndifferences between the responses of nurses and doctors. According to the\ndifferences in self-reported health and wellbeing labels between nurses and\ndoctors, and the correlations among their labels, we proposed a job-role based\nmultitask and multilabel deep learning model, where we modeled physiological\nand behavioral data for nurses and doctors simultaneously to predict\nparticipants' next day's multidimensional self-reported health and wellbeing\nstatus. Our model showed significantly better performances than baseline models\nand previous state-of-the-art models in the evaluations of binary/3-class\nclassification and regression prediction tasks. We also found features related\nto heart rate, sleep, and work shift contributed to shift workers' health and\nwellbeing.",

    "abstract": "Analytics on video recorded by cameras in public areas have the potential to\nfuel many exciting applications, but also pose the risk of intruding on\nindividuals' privacy. Unfortunately, existing solutions fail to practically\nresolve this tension between utility and privacy, relying on perfect detection\nof all private information in each video frame--an elusive requirement. This\npaper presents: (1) a new notion of differential privacy (DP) for video\nanalytics, $(\\rho,K,\\epsilon)$-event-duration privacy, which protects all\nprivate information visible for less than a particular duration, rather than\nrelying on perfect detections of that information, and (2) a practical system\ncalled Privid that enforces duration-based privacy even with the (untrusted)\nanalyst-provided deep neural networks that are commonplace for video analytics\ntoday. Across a variety of videos and queries, we show that Privid achieves\naccuracies within 79-99% of a non-private system.",

This\npaper aims to propose a federated data-driven evolutionary\nmulti-/many-objective optimization algorithm. To this end, we leverage\nfederated learning for surrogate construction so that multiple clients\ncollaboratively train a radial-basis-function-network as the global surrogate.\nThen a new federated acquisition function is proposed for the central server to\napproximate the objective values using the global surrogate and estimate the\nuncertainty level of the approximated objective values based on the local\nmodels.

    "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), more specifically their Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) variants, have been widely used as a deep learning tool for\ntackling sequence-based learning tasks in text and speech. Training of such\nLSTM applications is computationally intensive due to the recurrent nature of\nhidden state computation that repeats for each time step. While sparsity in\nDeep Neural Nets has been widely seen as an opportunity for reducing\ncomputation time in both training and inference phases, the usage of non-ReLU\nactivation in LSTM RNNs renders the opportunities for such dynamic sparsity\nassociated with neuron activation and gradient values to be limited or\nnon-existent. In this work, we identify dropout induced sparsity for LSTMs as a\nsuitable mode of computation reduction. Dropout is a widely used regularization\nmechanism, which randomly drops computed neuron values during each iteration of\ntraining. We propose to structure dropout patterns, by dropping out the same\nset of physical neurons within a batch, resulting in column (row) level hidden\nstate sparsity, which are well amenable to computation reduction at run-time in\ngeneral-purpose SIMD hardware as well as systolic arrays. We conduct our\nexperiments for three representative NLP tasks: language modelling on the PTB\ndataset, OpenNMT based machine translation using the IWSLT De-En and En-Vi\ndatasets, and named entity recognition sequence labelling using the CoNLL-2003\nshared task.

These transformations are typically selected from a set of\nfunctions that are known to maintain the identity of an input when applied\n(e.g., rotation, translation, flipping, and scaling). However, there are many\nnatural variations that cannot be labeled for supervision or defined through\nexamination of the data. As suggested by the manifold hypothesis, many of these\nnatural variations live on or near a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold.\nSeveral techniques represent manifold variations through a set of learned Lie\ngroup operators that define directions of motion on the manifold. However\ntheses approaches are limited because they require transformation labels when\ntraining their models and they lack a method for determining which regions of\nthe manifold are appropriate for applying each specific operator. We address\nthese limitations by introducing a learning strategy that does not require\ntransformation labels and developing a method that learns the local regions\nwhere each operator is likely to be used while preserving the identity of\ninputs.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a stochastic programming framework for multi-agent\nsystems where task decomposition, assignment, and scheduling problems are\nsimultaneously optimized. Due to their inherent flexibility and robustness,\nmulti-agent systems are applied in a growing range of real-world problems that\ninvolve heterogeneous tasks and uncertain information. Most previous works\nassume a unique way to decompose a task into roles that can later be assigned\nto the agents. This assumption is not valid for a complex task where the roles\ncan vary and multiple decomposition structures exist. Meanwhile, it is unclear\nhow uncertainties in task requirements and agent capabilities can be\nsystematically quantified and optimized under a multi-agent system setting. A\nrepresentation for complex tasks is proposed to avoid the non-convex task\ndecomposition enumeration: agent capabilities are represented as a vector of\nrandom distributions, and task requirements are verified by a generalizable\nbinary function. The conditional value at risk (CVaR) is chosen as a metric in\nthe objective function to generate robust plans. An efficient algorithm is\ndescribed to solve the model, and the whole framework is evaluated in two\ndifferent practical test cases: capture-the-flag and robotic service\ncoordination during a pandemic (e.g., COVID-19).

Traditional SR methods rely on the next item as\nthe supervision signal to guide preference extraction and representation. We\npropose a novel learning strategy, named preference editing. The idea is to\nforce the SR model to discriminate the common and unique preferences in\ndifferent sequences of interactions between users and the recommender system.\nBy doing so, the SR model is able to learn how to identify common and unique\nuser preferences, and thereby do better user preference extraction and\nrepresentation. We propose a transformer based SR model, named MrTransformer\n(Multi-preference Transformer), that concatenates some special tokens in front\nof the sequence to represent multiple user preferences and makes sure they\ncapture different aspects through a preference coverage mechanism. Then, we\ndevise a preference editing-based self-supervised learning mechanism for\ntraining MrTransformer which contains two main operations: preference\nseparation and preference recombination. The former separates the common and\nunique user preferences for a given pair of sequences. The latter swaps the\ncommon preferences to obtain recombined user preferences for each sequence.\nBased on the preference separation and preference recombination operations, we\ndefine two types of SSL loss that require that the recombined preferences are\nsimilar to the original ones, and the common preferences are close to each\nother.\nWe carry out extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. MrTransformer\nwith preference editing significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods\nin terms of Recall, MRR and NDCG.

    "abstract": "Concatenating the state-of-the-art codes at moderate rates with repetition\ncodes has emerged as a practical solution deployed in various standards for\nultra-low-power devices such as in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. In this\npaper, we propose a novel concatenation mechanism for such applications which\nneed to operate at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. In the proposed\nscheme, the outer code is a hybrid polar code constructed in two stages, one\nwith a binary kernel and another also with a binary kernel but applied over a\nbinary extension field. The inner code is a non-binary multiplicative\nrepetition code. This particular structure inherits low-complexity decoding\nstructures of polar codes while enabling concatenation with an inner non-binary\nmultiplicative repetition scheme. The decoding for the proposed scheme is done\nusing cyclic redundancy check (CRC) aided successive cancellation list (SCL)\ndecoder over AWGN channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nhybrid non-binary repeated polar code provides performance gain compared to a\npolar-repetition scheme with comparable decoding complexity.",

    "abstract": "It is desirable to transfer the knowledge stored in a well-trained source\nmodel onto non-annotated target domain in the absence of source data. However,\nstate-of-the-art methods for source free domain adaptation (SFDA) are subject\nto strict limits: 1) access to internal specifications of source models is a\nmust; and 2) pseudo labels should be clean during self-training, making\ncritical tasks relying on semantic segmentation unreliable. Aiming at these\npitfalls, this study develops a domain adaptive solution to semantic\nsegmentation with pseudo label rectification (namely \\textit{PR-SFDA}), which\noperates in two phases: 1) \\textit{Confidence-regularized unsupervised\nlearning}: Maximum squares loss applies to regularize the target model to\nensure the confidence in prediction; and 2) \\textit{Noise-aware pseudo label\nlearning}: Negative learning enables tolerance to noisy pseudo labels in\ntraining, meanwhile positive learning achieves fast convergence. Extensive\nexperiments have been performed on domain adaptive semantic segmentation\nbenchmark, \\textit{GTA5 $\\to$ Cityscapes}. Overall, \\textit{PR-SFDA} achieves a\nperformance of 49.0 mIoU, which is very close to that of the state-of-the-art\ncounterparts. Note that the latter demand accesses to the source model's\ninternal specifications, whereas the \\textit{PR-SFDA} solution needs none as a\nsharp contrast.",

We also used the well known DeepFashion\ndataset in addition to InFashAIv1. Captions are generated using the\n\\textit{Show and Tell} model made of CNN encoder and RNN Decoder. We showed\nthat jointly training the model on both datasets improves captions quality for\nAfrican style fashion images, suggesting a transfer learning from Western style\ndata. The InFashAIv1 dataset is released on\n\\href{https://github.com/hgilles06/infashai}{Github} to encourage works with\nmore diversity inclusion.",

Humans glance at a crowd image and instantly know\nthe approximate number of human and where they are through attention the crowd\nregions and the congestion degree of crowd regions with a global receptive\nfiled. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel feedback network with\nRegion-Aware block called RANet by modeling human's Top-Down visual perception\nmechanism. Firstly, we introduce a feedback architecture to generate priority\nmaps that provide prior about candidate crowd regions in input images. The\nprior enables the RANet pay more attention to crowd regions. Then we design\nRegion-Aware block that could adaptively encode the contextual information into\ninput images through global receptive field. More specifically, we scan the\nwhole input images and its priority maps in the form of column vector to obtain\na relevance matrix estimating their similarity. The relevance matrix obtained\nwould be utilized to build global relationships between pixels. Our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art crowd counting methods on several public datasets.",

We prepared, performed, and evaluated an agile educational concept\nfor the new Master of Science program Digital Transformation organized and\nprovided by the department of business computing at the University of Applied\nSciences and Arts - Hochschule Hannover in Germany. The course deals with\ninnovative methodologies of agile project management and is attended by 25\nstudents. We performed the class due the summer term in 2019 and 2020 as a\nteaching pair. The eduScrum method has been used in different educational\ncontexts, including higher education. During the approach preparation, we\ndecided to use challenges, problems, or questions from the industry. Thus, we\nacquired four companies and prepared in coordination with them dedicated\nproject descriptions. Each project description was refined in the form of a\nbacklog (list of requirements). We divided the class into four eduScrum teams,\none team for each project. The subdivision of the class was done randomly.\nSince we wanted to integrate realistic projects into industry partners'\nimplementation, we decided to adapt the eduScrum approach. The eduScrum teams\nwere challenged with different projects, e.g., analyzing a dedicated phenomenon\nin a real project or creating a theoretical model for a company's new project\nmanagement approach. We present our experiences of the whole process to\nprepare, perform and evaluate an agile educational approach combined with\nprojects from practice. We found, that the students value the agile method\nusing real world problems.

Unfortunately, prior efforts with diverse precisions (e.g.,\n1-bit weights and 2-bit activations) are usually restricted by limited\nprecision support on GPUs (e.g., int1 and int4). To break such restrictions, we\nintroduce the first Arbitrary Precision Neural Network framework (APNN-TC) to\nfully exploit quantization benefits on Ampere GPU Tensor Cores. Specifically,\nAPNN-TC first incorporates a novel emulation algorithm to support arbitrary\nshort bit-width computation with int1 compute primitives and XOR/AND Boolean\noperations. Second, APNN-TC integrates arbitrary precision layer designs to\nefficiently map our emulation algorithm to Tensor Cores with novel batching\nstrategies and specialized memory organization. Third, APNN-TC embodies a novel\narbitrary precision NN design to minimize memory access across layers and\nfurther improve performance. Extensive evaluations show that APNN-TC can\nachieve significant speedup over CUTLASS kernels and various NN models, such as\nResNet and VGG.",

We propose a deep learning-based cough sound classification model that\ncan distinguish between children with healthy versus pathological coughs such\nas asthma, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and lower respiratory\ntract infection (LRTI). In order to train a deep neural network model, we\ncollected a new dataset of cough sounds, labelled with clinician's diagnosis.\nThe chosen model is a bidirectional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM)\nbased on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features. The resulting\ntrained model when trained for classifying two classes of coughs -- healthy or\npathology (in general or belonging to a specific respiratory pathology),\nreaches accuracy exceeding 84\\% when classifying cough to the label provided by\nthe physicians' diagnosis. In order to classify subject's respiratory pathology\ncondition, results of multiple cough epochs per subject were combined. The\nresulting prediction accuracy exceeds 91\\% for all three respiratory\npathologies. However, when the model is trained to classify and discriminate\namong the four classes of coughs, overall accuracy dropped: one class of\npathological coughs are often misclassified as other. However, if one consider\nthe healthy cough classified as healthy and pathological cough classified to\nhave some kind of pathologies, then the overall accuracy of four class model is\nabove 84\\%. A longitudinal study of MFCC feature space when comparing\npathological and recovered coughs collected from the same subjects revealed the\nfact that pathological cough irrespective of the underlying conditions occupy\nthe same feature space making it harder to differentiate only using MFCC\nfeatures.",

    "abstract": "This work tackles the issue of fairness in the context of generative\nprocedures, such as image super-resolution, which entail different definitions\nfrom the standard classification setting. Moreover, while traditional group\nfairness definitions are typically defined with respect to specified protected\ngroups -- camouflaging the fact that these groupings are artificial and carry\nhistorical and political motivations -- we emphasize that there are no ground\ntruth identities. For instance, should South and East Asians be viewed as a\nsingle group or separate groups? Should we consider one race as a whole or\nfurther split by gender? Choosing which groups are valid and who belongs in\nthem is an impossible dilemma and being ``fair'' with respect to Asians may\nrequire being ``unfair'' with respect to South Asians. This motivates the\nintroduction of definitions that allow algorithms to be \\emph{oblivious} to the\nrelevant groupings.\nWe define several intuitive notions of group fairness and study their\nincompatibilities and trade-offs. We show that the natural extension of\ndemographic parity is strongly dependent on the grouping, and \\emph{impossible}\nto achieve obliviously. On the other hand, the conceptually new definition we\nintroduce, Conditional Proportional Representation, can be achieved obliviously\nthrough Posterior Sampling. Our experiments validate our theoretical results\nand achieve fair image reconstruction using state-of-the-art generative models.",

Elderly people have several needs and\nrequirements due to physical disabilities, cognitive issues, weakened memory\nand disorganized behavior, that they face with increasing age. The extent of\nthese limitations also differs according to the varying diversities in elderly,\nwhich include age, gender, background, experience, skills, knowledge and so on.\nThese varying needs and challenges with increasing age, limits abilities of\nolder adults to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in an independent\nmanner. To add to it, the shortage of caregivers creates a looming need for\ntechnology-based services for elderly people, to assist them in performing\ntheir daily routine tasks to sustain their independent living and active aging.\nTo address these needs, this work consists of making three major contributions\nin this field.

Second,\nthe work discusses the challenges identified through this review, that\ncurrently exist in the context of implementation of assisted living services\nfor elderly care in Smart Homes and Smart Cities.

Recent works on WET have mainly focused on\nextremely low-power/cost IoT applications. However, trending technologies such\nas energy beamforming and waveform optimization, distributed and massive\nantenna systems, smart reflect arrays and reconfigurable metasurfaces, flexible\nenergy transmitters, and mobile edge computing, may broaden WET applicability,\nand turn it plausible for powering more energy-hungry IoT devices. In this\nwork, we specifically leverage energy beamforming for powering multiple user\nequipments (UEs) with stringent energy harvesting (EH) demands in an indoor\ncell-free massive MIMO. Based on semi-definite programming, successive convex\napproximation (SCA), and maximum ratio transmission (MRT) techniques, we derive\noptimal and sub-optimal precoders aimed at minimizing the radio stripes'\ntransmit power while exploiting information of the power transfer efficiency of\nthe EH circuits at the UEs. Moreover, we propose an analytical framework to\nassess and control the electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation exposure in the\nconsidered indoor scenario. Numerical results show that i) the EMF radiation\nexposure can be more easily controlled at higher frequencies at the cost of a\nhigher transmit power consumption, ii) training is not a very critical factor\nfor the considered indoor system, iii) MRT/SCA-based precoders are particularly\nappealing when serving a small number of UEs, thus, specially suitable for\nimplementation in a time domain multiple access (TDMA) scheduling framework,\nand iv) TDMA is more efficient than spatial domain multiple access (SDMA) when\nserving a relatively small number of UEs.

    "abstract": "To further improve the learning efficiency and performance of reinforcement\nlearning (RL), in this paper we propose a novel uncertainty-aware model-based\nRL (UA-MBRL) framework, and then implement and validate it in autonomous\ndriving under various task scenarios. First, an action-conditioned ensemble\nmodel with the ability of uncertainty assessment is established as the virtual\nenvironment model. Then, a novel uncertainty-aware model-based RL framework is\ndeveloped based on the adaptive truncation approach, providing virtual\ninteractions between the agent and environment model, and improving RL's\ntraining efficiency and performance. The developed algorithms are then\nimplemented in end-to-end autonomous vehicle control tasks, validated and\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods under various driving scenarios. The\nvalidation results suggest that the proposed UA-MBRL method surpasses the\nexisting model-based and model-free RL approaches, in terms of learning\nefficiency and achieved performance. The results also demonstrate the good\nability of the proposed method with respect to the adaptiveness and robustness,\nunder various autonomous driving scenarios.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new method for unsupervised continual knowledge consolidation in\ngenerative models that relies on the partitioning of Variational Autoencoder's\nlatent space. Acquiring knowledge about new data samples without forgetting\nprevious ones is a critical problem of continual learning. Currently proposed\nmethods achieve this goal by extending the existing model while constraining\nits behavior not to degrade on the past data, which does not exploit the full\npotential of relations within the entire training dataset. In this work, we\nidentify this limitation and posit the goal of continual learning as a\nknowledge accumulation task. We solve it by continuously re-aligning latent\nspace partitions that we call bands which are representations of samples seen\nin different tasks, driven by the similarity of the information they contain.\nIn addition, we introduce a simple yet effective method for controlled\nforgetting of past data that improves the quality of reconstructions encoded in\nlatent bands and a latent space disentanglement technique that improves\nknowledge consolidation. On top of the standard continual learning evaluation\nbenchmarks, we evaluate our method on a new knowledge consolidation scenario\nand show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art by up to\ntwofold across all testing scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Although instance segmentation has made considerable advancement over recent\nyears, it's still a challenge to design high accuracy algorithms with real-time\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a real-time instance segmentation\nframework termed OrienMask. Upon the one-stage object detector YOLOv3, a mask\nhead is added to predict some discriminative orientation maps, which are\nexplicitly defined as spatial offset vectors for both foreground and background\npixels. Thanks to the discrimination ability of orientation maps, masks can be\nrecovered without the need for extra foreground segmentation. All instances\nthat match with the same anchor size share a common orientation map. This\nspecial sharing strategy reduces the amortized memory utilization for mask\npredictions but without loss of mask granularity. Given the surviving box\npredictions after NMS, instance masks can be concurrently constructed from the\ncorresponding orientation maps with low complexity. Owing to the concise design\nfor mask representation and its effective integration with the anchor-based\nobject detector, our method is qualified under real-time conditions while\nmaintaining competitive accuracy. Experiments on COCO benchmark show that\nOrienMask achieves 34.8 mask AP at the speed of 42.7 fps evaluated with a\nsingle RTX 2080 Ti. The code is available at https://github.com/duwt/OrienMask.",

Biomedical NER,\nthe task of recognising biomedical names, is usually employed as the first step\nof the NLP pipeline. Standard NER models, based on sequence tagging technique,\nare good at recognising short entity mentions in the generic domain. However,\nthere are several open challenges of applying these models to recognise\nbiomedical names: 1) Biomedical names may contain complex inner structure\n(discontinuity and overlapping) which cannot be recognised using standard\nsequence tagging technique; 2) The training of NER models usually requires\nlarge amount of labelled data, which are difficult to obtain in the biomedical\ndomain; and, 3) Commonly used language representation models are pre-trained on\ngeneric data; a domain shift therefore exists between these models and target\nbiomedical data.

These models can\nbecome prohibitively large in settings such as neuroimaging, where a sample is\ncomposed of a functional MRI signal measured on 64 thousand brain locations,\nacross 4 measurement sessions, and at least tens of subjects. Even a reduced\nexample on a specific cortical region of 300 brain locations features around 1\nmillion parameters, hampering the usage of modern density estimation techniques\nsuch as Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). To infer parameter posterior\ndistributions in this challenging class of problems, we designed a novel\nmethodology that automatically produces a variational family dual to a target\nHBM. This variatonal family, represented as a neural network, consists in the\ncombination of an attention-based hierarchical encoder feeding summary\nstatistics to a set of normalizing flows. Our automatically-derived neural\nnetwork exploits exchangeability in the plate-enriched HBM and factorizes its\nparameter space. The resulting architecture reduces by orders of magnitude its\nparameterization with respect to that of a typical SBI representation, while\nmaintaining expressivity. Our method performs inference on the specified HBM in\nan amortized setup: once trained, it can readily be applied to a new data\nsample to compute the parameters' full posterior. We demonstrate the capability\nof our method on simulated data, as well as a challenging high-dimensional\nbrain parcellation experiment.

    "title": "Mutual-Information Based Few-Shot Classification",
    "abstract": "We introduce Transductive Infomation Maximization (TIM) for few-shot\nlearning. Our method maximizes the mutual information between the query\nfeatures and their label predictions for a given few-shot task, in conjunction\nwith a supervision loss based on the support set. We motivate our transductive\nloss by deriving a formal relation between the classification accuracy and\nmutual-information maximization. Furthermore, we propose a new\nalternating-direction solver, which substantially speeds up transductive\ninference over gradient-based optimization, while yielding competitive\naccuracy. We also provide a convergence analysis of our solver based on\nZangwill's theory and bound-optimization arguments. TIM inference is modular:\nit can be used on top of any base-training feature extractor. Following\nstandard transductive few-shot settings, our comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that TIM outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly across\nvarious datasets and networks, while used on top of a fixed feature extractor\ntrained with simple cross-entropy on the base classes, without resorting to\ncomplex meta-learning schemes. It consistently brings between 2 % and 5 %\nimprovement in accuracy over the best performing method, not only on all the\nwell-established few-shot benchmarks but also on more challenging scenarios,\nwith random tasks, domain shift and larger numbers of classes, as in the\nrecently introduced META-DATASET. Our code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/mboudiaf/TIM. We also publicly release a standalone PyTorch\nimplementation of META-DATASET, along with additional benchmarking results, at\nhttps://github.com/mboudiaf/pytorch-meta-dataset.",

    "abstract": "Power distribution systems are experiencing a large-scale integration of\nConverter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources (CIDERs). This complicates\nthe analysis and mitigation of harmonics, whose creation and propagation are\nfacilitated by the interactions of converters and their controllers through the\ngrid. In this paper, a method for the calculation of the so-called Harmonic\nPower-Flow (HPF) in three-phase grids with CIDERs is proposed. The\ndistinguishing feature of this HPF method is the generic and modular\nrepresentation of the system components. Notably, as opposed to most of the\nexisting approaches, the coupling between harmonics is explicitly considered.\nThe HPF problem is formulated by combining the hybrid nodal equations of the\ngrid with the closed-loop transfer functions of the CIDERs, and solved using\nthe Newton-Raphson method. The grid components are characterized by compound\nelectrical parameters, which allow to represent both transposed or\nnon-transposed lines. The CIDERs are represented by modular linear\ntime-periodic systems, which allows to treat both grid-forming and\ngrid-following control laws. The method's accuracy and computational efficiency\nare confirmed via time-domain simulations of the CIGR\\'E low-voltage benchmark\nmicrogrid. This paper is divided in two parts, which focus on the development\n(Part I) and the validation (Part II) of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "In most games, social connections are an essential part of the gaming\nexperience. Players connect in communities inside or around games and form\nfriendships, which can be translated into other games or even in the real\nworld. Recent research has investigated social phenomena within the player\nsocial network of several multiplayer games, yet we still know very little\nabout how these networks are shaped and formed. Specifically, we are unaware of\nhow the game type and its mechanics are related to its community structure and\nhow those structures vary in different games. This paper presents an initial\nanalysis of Steam users and how friendships on Steam are formed around 200\ngames. We examine the friendship graphs of these 200 games by dividing them\ninto clusters to compare their network properties and their specific\ncharacteristics (e.g., genre, game elements, and mechanics). We found how the\nSteam user-defined tags better characterized the clusters than the game genre,\nsuggesting that how players perceive and use the game also reflects how they\nconnect in the community. Moreover, team-based games are associated with more\ncohesive and clustered networks than games with a stronger single-player focus,\nsupporting the idea that playing together in teams more likely produces social\ncapital (i.e., Steam friendships).",

    "abstract": "Histological subtype of papillary (p) renal cell carcinoma (RCC), type 1 vs.\ntype 2, is an essential prognostic factor. The two subtypes of pRCC have a\nsimilar pattern, i.e., the papillary architecture, yet some subtle differences,\nincluding cellular and cell-layer level patterns. However, the cellular and\ncell-layer level patterns almost cannot be captured by existing CNN-based\nmodels in large-size histopathological images, which brings obstacles to\ndirectly applying these models to such a fine-grained classification task. This\npaper proposes a novel instance-based Vision Transformer (i-ViT) to learn\nrobust representations of histopathological images for the pRCC subtyping task\nby extracting finer features from instance patches (by cropping around\nsegmented nuclei and assigning predicted grades). The proposed i-ViT takes\ntop-K instances as input and aggregates them for capturing both the cellular\nand cell-layer level patterns by a position-embedding layer, a grade-embedding\nlayer, and a multi-head multi-layer self-attention module. To evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed framework, experienced pathologists are invited to\nselected 1162 regions of interest from 171 whole slide images of type 1 and\ntype 2 pRCC.

The synthesized attacker needs to ensure both the damage-reachability\nand the covertness against all the supervisors which are consistent with the\ngiven set of observations. There is a gap between the de facto maximal\npermissiveness, assuming the model of the supervisor is known, and the maximal\npermissiveness that can be attained with a limited knowledge of the model of\nthe supervisor, from the adversary's point of view. We consider the setup where\nthe attacker can exercise sensor replacement/deletion attacks and actuator\nenablement/disablement attacks. The solution methodology proposed in this work\nis to reduce the synthesis of maximally permissive covert damage-reachable\nattackers, given the model of the plant and the finite set of observations, to\nthe synthesis of maximally permissive safe supervisors for certain transformed\nplant, which shows the decidability of the observation-assisted covert attacker\nsynthesis problem.

Previous work has shown the interest of DVAEs and\ntheir better performance over the VAE for speech signals (spectrogram)\nmodeling.

In this paper, we extend\nthose works to DVAE-based single-channel unsupervised speech enhancement, hence\nexploiting both speech signals unsupervised representation learning and\ndynamics modeling. We propose an unsupervised speech enhancement algorithm\nbased on the most general form of DVAEs, that we then adapt to three specific\nDVAE models to illustrate the versatility of the framework.

    "abstract": "Cascaded binary hypothesis testing is studied in this paper with two decision\ncenters at the relay and the receiver. All terminals have their own\nobservations, where we assume that the observations at the transmitter, the\nrelay, and the receiver form a Markov chain in this order. The communication\noccurs over two hops, from the transmitter to the relay and from the relay to\nthe receiver. Expected rate constraints are imposed on both communication\nlinks. In this work, we characterize the optimal type-II error exponents at the\ntwo decision centers under constraints on the allowed type-I error\nprobabilities. Our recent work characterized the optimal type-II error\nexponents in the special case when the two decision centers have same type-I\nerror constraints and provided an achievability scheme for the general setup.\nTo obtain the exact characterization for the general case, in this paper we\nprovide a new converse proof as well as a new matching achievability scheme.\nOur results indicate that under unequal type-I error constraints at the relay\nand the receiver, a tradeoff arises between the maximum type-II error\nprobabilities at these two terminals. Previous results showed that such a\ntradeoff does not exist under equal type-I error constraints or under general\ntype-I error constraints when a maximum rate constraint is imposed on the\ncommunication links.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has become an active and promising distributed\nmachine learning paradigm. As a result of statistical heterogeneity, recent\nstudies clearly show that the performance of popular FL methods (e.g., FedAvg)\ndeteriorates dramatically due to the client drift caused by local updates. This\npaper proposes a novel Federated Learning algorithm (called IGFL), which\nleverages both Individual and Group behaviors to mimic distribution, thereby\nimproving the ability to deal with heterogeneity. Unlike existing FL methods,\nour IGFL can be applied to both client and server optimization. As a\nby-product, we propose a new attention-based federated learning in the server\noptimization of IGFL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to\nincorporate attention mechanisms into federated optimization. We conduct\nextensive experiments and show that IGFL can significantly improve the\nperformance of existing federated learning methods. Especially when the\ndistributions of data among individuals are diverse, IGFL can improve the\nclassification accuracy by about 13% compared with prior baselines.",

    "abstract": "3D face reconstruction from a single image is a task that has garnered\nincreased interest in the Computer Vision community, especially due to its\nbroad use in a number of applications such as realistic 3D avatar creation,\npose invariant face recognition and face hallucination. Since the introduction\nof the 3D Morphable Model in the late 90's, we witnessed an explosion of\nresearch aiming at particularly tackling this task. Nevertheless, despite the\nincreasing level of detail in the 3D face reconstructions from single images\nmainly attributed to deep learning advances, finer and highly deformable\ncomponents of the face such as the tongue are still absent from all 3D face\nmodels in the literature, although being very important for the realness of the\n3D avatar representations. In this work we present the first, to the best of\nour knowledge, end-to-end trainable pipeline that accurately reconstructs the\n3D face together with the tongue. Moreover, we make this pipeline robust in\n\"in-the-wild\" images by introducing a novel GAN method tailored for 3D tongue\nsurface generation. Finally, we make publicly available to the community the\nfirst diverse tongue dataset, consisting of 1,800 raw scans of 700 individuals\nvarying in gender, age, and ethnicity backgrounds. As we demonstrate in an\nextensive series of quantitative as well as qualitative experiments, our model\nproves to be robust and realistically captures the 3D tongue structure, even in\nadverse \"in-the-wild\" conditions.",

More\nrecently, this focus has been expanded by the notion of model robustness, i.e.\nthe generalization abilities of models towards previously unseen changes in the\ndata distribution. While new benchmarks, like ImageNet-C, have been introduced\nto measure robustness properties, we argue that fixed testsets are only able to\ncapture a small portion of possible data variations and are thus limited and\nprone to generate new overfitted solutions. To overcome these drawbacks, we\nsuggest to estimate the robustness of a model directly from the structure of\nits learned feature-space.

The idea of the atomicity\nprinciple is to make kP implementations resistant against simple side channel\nanalysis attacks. One of the assumptions, on which the atomicity principle is\nbased, is the indistinguishability of register operations, i.e. two\nwrite-to-register operations cannot be distinguished if their old and new data\nvalues are the same. But before the data can be stored to a register/block,\nthis register/block has to be addressed for storing the data. Different\nregisters/blocks have different addresses. In praxis, this different and key\ndependent addressing can be used to reveal the key, even by running simple SCA\nattacks. The key dependent addressing of registers/blocks allows to reveal the\nkey and is an inherent feature of the binary kP algorithms. This means that the\nassumption, that addressing of different registers/blocks is an\nindistinguishable operation, may no longer be applied when realizing kP\nimplementations, at least not for hardware implementations.",

In this paper, we\nconsider two natural distributed settings. In the location-aware setting (when\nnodes know their coordinates in the plane), we give a constant time distributed\nalgorithm coloring any unit-disk graph $G$ with at most\n$(3+\\epsilon)\\omega(G)+6$ colors, for any constant $\\epsilon>0$, where\n$\\omega(G)$ is the clique number of $G$.

    "abstract": "This paper considers an energy harvesting (EH) based multiuser mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) system, where each user utilizes the harvested energy from\nrenewable energy sources to execute its computation tasks via computation\noffloading and local computing. Towards maximizing the system's weighted\ncomputation rate (i.e., the number of weighted users' computing bits within a\nfinite time horizon) subject to the users' energy causality constraints due to\ndynamic energy arrivals, the decision for joint computation offloading and\nlocal computing over time is optimized {\\em over time}. Assuming that the\nprofile of channel state information and dynamic task arrivals at the users is\nknown in advance, the weighted computation rate maximization problem becomes a\nconvex optimization problem. Building on the Lagrange duality method, the\nwell-structured optimal solution is analytically obtained. Both the users'\nlocal computing and offloading rates are shown to have a monotonically\nincreasing structure. Numerical results show that the proposed design scheme\ncan achieve a significant performance gain over the alternative benchmark\nschemes.",

The model has a number\nof implementation prospects, one being DNA strands that attach to a DNA origami\nsubstrate.

Our second\ntile set has 6 tiles and is called the Collatz tile set as it produces patterns\nfound in binary/ternary representations of iterations of the Collatz function.\nUsing computer search we find that the Collatz tile set is expressive enough to\nencode Boolean circuits using blocks of these patterns.

One possible approach to shorten this window aims to\ndetect phishing attacks earlier, during website preparation, by monitoring\nCertificate Transparency (CT) logs.

Its modular structure makes it possible to easily\nexchange classifiers or verification sources to support ground truth labeling\nefforts and classifier comparisons.

    "abstract": "To exploit the advantageous properties of isogeometric analysis (IGA) in a\nscan-based setting, it is important to extract a smooth geometric domain from\nthe scan data (e.g., voxel data). IGA-suitable domains can be constructed by\nconvoluting the grayscale data using B-splines. A negative side-effect of this\nconvolution technique is, however, that it can induce topological changes in\nthe process of smoothing when features with a size similar to that of the\nvoxels are encountered. This manuscript presents an enhanced B-spline-based\nsegmentation procedure using a refinement strategy based on truncated\nhierarchical (TH)B-splines. A Fourier analysis is presented to explain the\neffectiveness of local grayscale function refinement in repairing topological\nanomalies. A moving-window-based topological anomaly detection algorithm is\nproposed to identify regions in which the grayscale function refinements must\nbe performed. The criterion to identify topological anomalies is based on the\nEuler characteristic, giving it the capability to distinguish between\ntopological and shape changes. The proposed topology-preserving THB-spline\nimage segmentation strategy is studied using a range of test cases.

The\ncommunication channel between the vehicles of a platoon can be easily\ninfluenced by numerous factors, e.g. the surrounding environment, and the\nrelative states of the connected vehicles, etc. In addition, the trajectories\nof the vehicles depend significantly on the motion policies of the preceding\nvehicle shared via the wireless channel and any delay can impact the safety and\noptimality of its performance. In the presented algorithm, Gaussian Process\nlearns the wireless channel model and is involved in the Model Predictive\nController to generate a control sequence that not only minimizes the\nconventional motion costs, but also minimizes the estimated delay of the\nwireless channel in the future. This results in a farsighted controller that\nmaximizes the amount of transferred information beyond the controller's time\nhorizon, which in turn guarantees the safety and optimality of the generated\ntrajectories in the future. To decrease computational cost, the algorithm finds\nthe reachable set from the current state and focuses on that region to minimize\nthe size of the kernel matrix and related calculations.

By realizing the\nimportance of the positional information carried by 2D feature representations,\nunlike recent MLP-like models that encode the spatial information along the\nflattened spatial dimensions, Vision Permutator separately encodes the feature\nrepresentations along the height and width dimensions with linear projections.\nThis allows Vision Permutator to capture long-range dependencies along one\nspatial direction and meanwhile preserve precise positional information along\nthe other direction. The resulting position-sensitive outputs are then\naggregated in a mutually complementing manner to form expressive\nrepresentations of the objects of interest. We show that our Vision Permutators\nare formidable competitors to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision\ntransformers. Without the dependence on spatial convolutions or attention\nmechanisms, Vision Permutator achieves 81.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet without\nextra large-scale training data (e.g., ImageNet-22k) using only 25M learnable\nparameters, which is much better than most CNNs and vision transformers under\nthe same model size constraint. When scaling up to 88M, it attains 83.2% top-1\naccuracy.

However, doing so for real-life event descriptions is\nchallenging because an argument's role often varies in different contexts.\nWhile the relationship and interactions between multiple arguments are useful\nfor settling the argument roles, such information is largely ignored by\nexisting approaches. This paper presents a better approach for event extraction\nby explicitly utilizing the relationships of event arguments. We achieve this\nthrough a carefully designed task-oriented dialogue system. To model the\nargument relation, we employ reinforcement learning and incremental learning to\nextract multiple arguments via a multi-turned, iterative process. Our approach\nleverages knowledge of the already extracted arguments of the same sentence to\ndetermine the role of arguments that would be difficult to decide individually.\nIt then uses the newly obtained information to improve the decisions of\npreviously extracted arguments. This two-way feedback process allows us to\nexploit the argument relations to effectively settle argument roles, leading to\nbetter sentence understanding and event extraction.

    "abstract": "The subject of \"fairness\" in artificial intelligence (AI) refers to assessing\nAI algorithms for potential bias based on demographic characteristics such as\nrace and gender, and the development of algorithms to address this bias. Most\napplications to date have been in computer vision, although some work in\nhealthcare has started to emerge. The use of deep learning (DL) in cardiac MR\nsegmentation has led to impressive results in recent years, and such techniques\nare starting to be translated into clinical practice. However, no work has yet\ninvestigated the fairness of such models. In this work, we perform such an\nanalysis for racial/gender groups, focusing on the problem of training data\nimbalance, using a nnU-Net model trained and evaluated on cine short axis\ncardiac MR data from the UK Biobank dataset, consisting of 5,903 subjects from\n6 different racial groups. We find statistically significant differences in\nDice performance between different racial groups. To reduce the racial bias, we\ninvestigated three strategies: (1) stratified batch sampling, in which batch\nsampling is stratified to ensure balance between racial groups; (2) fair\nmeta-learning for segmentation, in which a DL classifier is trained to classify\nrace and jointly optimized with the segmentation model; and (3) protected group\nmodels, in which a different segmentation model is trained for each racial\ngroup. We also compared the results to the scenario where we have a perfectly\nbalanced database. To assess fairness we used the standard deviation (SD) and\nskewed error ratio (SER) of the average Dice values. Our results demonstrate\nthat the racial bias results from the use of imbalanced training data, and that\nall proposed bias mitigation strategies improved fairness, with the best SD and\nSER resulting from the use of protected group models.",

    "abstract": "Conceptually, partial information decomposition (PID) is concerned with\nseparating the information contributions several sources hold about a certain\ntarget by decomposing the corresponding joint mutual information into\ncontributions such as synergistic, redundant, or unique information. Despite\nPID conceptually being defined for any type of random variables, so far, PID\ncould only be quantified for the joint mutual information of discrete systems.\nRecently, a quantification for PID in continuous settings for two or three\nsource variables was introduced. Nonetheless, no ansatz has managed to both\nquantify PID for more than three variables and cover general measure-theoretic\nrandom variables, such as mixed discrete-continuous, or continuous random\nvariables yet. In this work we will propose an information quantity, defining\nthe terms of a PID, which is well-defined for any number or type of source or\ntarget random variable. This proposed quantity is tightly related to a recently\ndeveloped local shared information quantity for discrete random variables based\non the idea of shared exclusions. Further, we prove that this newly proposed\ninformation-measure fulfills various desirable properties, such as satisfying a\nset of local PID axioms, invariance under invertible transformations,\ndifferentiability with respect to the underlying probability density, and\nadmitting a target chain rule.",

Although current approaches can enforce terms to appear in the\ntranslation, they often struggle to make the constraint word form agree with\nthe rest of the generated output. Our manual analysis shows that 46% of the\nerrors in the output of a baseline constrained model for English to Czech\ntranslation are related to agreement.

In particular, we focus on methods based on training the model\nwith constraints provided as part of the input sequence. Our experiments on the\nEnglish-Czech language pair show that this approach improves the translation of\nconstrained terms in both automatic and manual evaluation by reducing errors in\nagreement.

    "abstract": "The use of distributed generation resources, in addition to considerable\nbenefits, causes some problems in the power system. One of the most critical\nproblems in the case of disruption is increasing short-circuit current level in\ngrids, which leads to change the protection devices settings in the downstream\nand upstream grid. By using fault current limiters (FCL), short-circuit\ncurrents in grids with distributed generation can be reduced to acceptable\nlevels, so there is no needed to change the protection relays settings of the\ndownstream grid (including distributed generations). However, by locating the\nFCL in the tie-feeder, the downstream grid is not more effective than the\nupstream grid and thus its reliability indices also will be changed. Therefore,\nthis paper shows that by locating the unidirectional fault current limiter\n(UFCL) in the tie-feeder, the necessity of changing in the relay protection\nsettings of upstream grids is prevented. In this paper, the proposed method is\nimplemented, and its efficiency is reported in six scenarios.",

More seriously, the considerable\nvariations in scale and appearance of objects further deteriorate the\nrepresentational capacity of those se-mantic segmentation methods, leading to\nthe confusion of adjacent objects. Addressing such is-sues represents a\npromising research field in the remote sensing community, which paves the way\nfor scene-level landscape pattern analysis and decision making. In this\nmanuscript, we pro-pose a bilateral awareness network (BANet) which contains a\ndependency path and a texture path to fully capture the long-range\nrelationships and fine-grained details in VFR images. Specif-ically, the\ndependency path is conducted based on the ResT, a novel Transformer backbone\nwith memory-efficient multi-head self-attention, while the texture path is\nbuilt on the stacked convo-lution operation. Besides, using the linear\nattention mechanism, a feature aggregation module (FAM) is designed to\neffectively fuse the dependency features and texture features. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on the three large-scale urban scene image segmentation\ndatasets, i.e., ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, ISPRS Potsdam dataset, and UAVid\ndataset, demonstrate the effective-ness of our BANet.

Since human emotions\nare ambiguous and subjective, it is more reasonable to address VEA in a label\ndistribution learning (LDL) paradigm rather than a single-label classification\ntask. Different from other LDL tasks, there exist intrinsic relationships\nbetween emotions and unique characteristics within them, as demonstrated in\npsychological theories. Inspired by this, we propose a well-grounded\ncircular-structured representation to utilize the prior knowledge for visual\nemotion distribution learning. To be specific, we first construct an Emotion\nCircle to unify any emotional state within it. On the proposed Emotion Circle,\neach emotion distribution is represented with an emotion vector, which is\ndefined with three attributes (i.e., emotion polarity, emotion type, emotion\nintensity) as well as two properties (i.e., similarity, additivity). Besides,\nwe design a novel Progressive Circular (PC) loss to penalize the\ndissimilarities between predicted emotion vector and labeled one in a\ncoarse-to-fine manner, which further boosts the learning process in an\nemotion-specific way. Extensive experiments and comparisons are conducted on\npublic visual emotion distribution datasets, and the results demonstrate that\nthe proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "title": "Advancing Protocol Diversity in Network Security Monitoring",
    "abstract": "With information technology entering new fields and levels of deployment,\ne.g., in areas of energy, mobility, and production, network security monitoring\nneeds to be able to cope with those environments and their evolution. However,\nstate-of-the-art Network Security Monitors (NSMs) typically lack the necessary\nflexibility to handle the diversity of the packet-oriented layers below the\nabstraction of TCP/IP connections. In this work, we advance the software\narchitecture of a network security monitor to facilitate the flexible\nintegration of lower-layer protocol dissectors while maintaining required\nperformance levels. We proceed in three steps: First, we identify the\nchallenges for modular packet-level analysis, present a refined NSM\narchitecture to address them and specify requirements for its implementation.\nSecond, we evaluate the performance of data structures to be used for protocol\ndispatching, implement the proposed design into the popular open-source NSM\nZeek and assess its impact on the monitor performance. Our experiments show\nthat hash-based data structures for dispatching introduce a significant\noverhead while array-based approaches qualify for practical application.\nFinally, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed architecture and\nimplementation by migrating Zeek's previously hard-coded stack of link and\ninternet layer protocols to the new interface. Furthermore, we implement\ndissectors for non-IP based industrial communication protocols and leverage\nthem to realize attack detection strategies from recent applied research. We\nintegrate the proposed architecture into the Zeek open-source project and\npublish the implementation to support the scientific community as well as\npractitioners, promoting the transfer of research into practice.",

    "abstract": "Digital privacy notices aim to provide users with information to make\ninformed decisions. They are, however, fraught with difficulties. Instead, I\npropose that data privacy decisions can be understood as an expression of user\nvalues. To optimize this value expression, I further propose the creation of a\nvalue-centered privacy assistant (VcPA). Here, I preliminary explore how a VcPA\ncould enhance user value expression by utilizing three user scenarios in the\ncontext of considering whether or not to download an environmental application,\nthe OpenLitterMap app. These scenarios are conceptually constructed from\nestablished privacy user groups - the privacy fundamentalists; the privacy\npragmatists; and the privacy unconcerned. I conclude that the VcPA best\nfacilitates user value expression of the privacy fundamentalists. In contrast,\nthe value expression of the privacy pragmatists and the privacy unconcerned\ncould be enhanced or hindered depending on the context and their internal\nstates. Possible implications for optimal VcPA design are also discussed.\nFollowing this initial conceptual exploration of VcPAs, further empirical\nresearch will be required to demonstrate the effectiveness of the VcPA system\nin real-world settings.",

    "abstract": "In light of increasing recent attention to political polarization,\nunderstanding how polarization can arise poses an important theoretical\nquestion. While more classical models of opinion dynamics seem poorly equipped\nto study this phenomenon, a recent novel approach by H\\k{a}z{\\l}a, Jin, Mossel,\nand Ramnarayan (HJMR) proposes a simple geometric model of opinion evolution\nthat provably exhibits strong polarization in specialized cases. Moreover,\npolarization arises quite organically in their model: in each time step, each\nagent updates opinions according to their correlation/response with an issue\ndrawn at random. However, their techniques do not seem to extend beyond a set\nof special cases they identify, which benefit from fragile symmetry or\ncontractiveness assumptions, leaving open how general this phenomenon really\nis.\nIn this paper, we further the study of polarization in related geometric\nmodels. We show that the exact form of polarization in such models is quite\nnuanced: even when strong polarization does not hold, it is possible for weaker\nnotions of polarization to nonetheless attain. We provide a concrete example\nwhere weak polarization holds, but strong polarization provably fails. However,\nwe show that strong polarization provably holds in many variants of the HJMR\nmodel, which are also robust to a wider array of distributions of random issues\n-- this indicates that the form of polarization introduced by HJMR is more\nuniversal than suggested by their special cases. We also show that the weaker\nnotions connect more readily to the theory of Markov chains on general state\nspaces.",

However, these\nover-parameterized models are inherently non-interpretable and do not provide\nany information on the parts of the documents that were used to arrive at a\ncertain prediction.\nIn this paper we introduce the select and rank paradigm for document ranking,\nwhere interpretability is explicitly ensured when scoring longer documents.\nSpecifically, we first select sentences in a document based on the input query\nand then predict the query-document score based only on the selected sentences,\nacting as an explanation. We treat sentence selection as a latent variable\ntrained jointly with the ranker from the final output. We conduct extensive\nexperiments to demonstrate that our inherently interpretable select-and-rank\napproach is competitive in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods and\nsometimes even outperforms them. This is due to our novel end-to-end training\napproach based on weighted reservoir sampling that manages to train the\nselector despite the stochastic sentence selection. We also show that our\nsentence selection approach can be used to provide explanations for models that\noperate on only parts of the document, such as BERT.",

A prominent\nchallenge for bilateral control of such teleoperators lies in the closed\narchitecture, especially in the context not involving interaction force/torque\nmeasurement. This yields the long-standing situation that most bilateral\ncontrol rigorously developed in the literature is hard to be justified as\napplied to teleoperators with closed architecture. With a new class of dynamic\nfeedback, we propose kinematic and adaptive dynamic controllers for\nteleoperators with closed architecture, and we show that the proposed kinematic\nand dynamic controllers are robust with respect to arbitrary bounded\ntime-varying delay. In addition, by exploiting the input-output properties of\nan inverted form of the dynamics of robot manipulators with closed\narchitecture, we remove the assumption of uniform exponential stability of a\nlinear time-varying system due to the adaptation to the gains of the inner\ncontroller in demonstrating stability of the presented adaptive dynamic\ncontrol.

    "abstract": "Transfer learning has become a common solution to address training data\nscarcity in practice. It trains a specified student model by reusing or\nfine-tuning early layers of a well-trained teacher model that is usually\npublicly available. However, besides utility improvement, the transferred\npublic knowledge also brings potential threats to model confidentiality, and\neven further raises other security and privacy issues.\nIn this paper, we present the first comprehensive investigation of the\nteacher model exposure threat in the transfer learning context, aiming to gain\na deeper insight into the tension between public knowledge and model\nconfidentiality. To this end, we propose a teacher model fingerprinting attack\nto infer the origin of a student model, i.e., the teacher model it transfers\nfrom. Specifically, we propose a novel optimization-based method to carefully\ngenerate queries to probe the student model to realize our attack. Unlike\nexisting model reverse engineering approaches, our proposed fingerprinting\nmethod neither relies on fine-grained model outputs, e.g., posteriors, nor\nauxiliary information of the model architecture or training dataset. We\nsystematically evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The empirical\nresults demonstrate that our attack can accurately identify the model origin\nwith few probing queries.

Such properties lead us to develop SELCON, an\nefficient majorization-minimization algorithm for data subset selection, that\nadmits an approximation guarantee even when the training provides an imperfect\nestimate of the trained model. Finally, our experiments on several datasets\nshow that SELCON trades off accuracy and efficiency more effectively than the\ncurrent state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from\na labeled source domain to an unlabeled and unseen target domain, which is\nusually trained on data from both domains. Access to the source domain data at\nthe adaptation stage, however, is often limited, due to data storage or privacy\nissues. To alleviate this, in this work, we target source free UDA for\nsegmentation, and propose to adapt an ``off-the-shelf\" segmentation model\npre-trained in the source domain to the target domain, with an adaptive\nbatch-wise normalization statistics adaptation framework. Specifically, the\ndomain-specific low-order batch statistics, i.e., mean and variance, are\ngradually adapted with an exponential momentum decay scheme, while the\nconsistency of domain shareable high-order batch statistics, i.e., scaling and\nshifting parameters, is explicitly enforced by our optimization objective. The\ntransferability of each channel is adaptively measured first from which to\nbalance the contribution of each channel. Moreover, the proposed source free\nUDA framework is orthogonal to unsupervised learning methods, e.g.,\nself-entropy minimization, which can thus be simply added on top of our\nframework. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 database show that our\nsource free UDA framework outperformed existing source-relaxed UDA methods for\nthe cross-subtype UDA segmentation task and yielded comparable results for the\ncross-modality UDA segmentation task, compared with a supervised UDA methods\nwith the source data.",

Existing approaches generally seek to decouple\nstorage and visualization systems, performing just-in-time data reduction to\ntransparently avoid overloading the visualizer. We present a new architecture\nin which the visualizer and data store are tightly coupled. Unlike systems that\nread raw data from storage, the performance of our system scales linearly with\nthe size of the final visualization, essentially independent of the size of the\ndata. Thus, it scales to massive data sets while supporting interactive\nperformance (sub-100 ms query latency). This enables a new class of\nvisualization clients that automatically manage data, quickly and transparently\nrequesting data from the underlying database without requiring the user to\nexplicitly initiate queries.

    "abstract": "As predictive models are deployed into the real world, they must increasingly\ncontend with strategic behavior. A growing body of work on strategic\nclassification treats this problem as a Stackelberg game: the decision-maker\n\"leads\" in the game by deploying a model, and the strategic agents \"follow\" by\nplaying their best response to the deployed model. Importantly, in this\nframing, the burden of learning is placed solely on the decision-maker, while\nthe agents' best responses are implicitly treated as instantaneous. In this\nwork, we argue that the order of play in strategic classification is\nfundamentally determined by the relative frequencies at which the\ndecision-maker and the agents adapt to each other's actions. In particular, by\ngeneralizing the standard model to allow both players to learn over time, we\nshow that a decision-maker that makes updates faster than the agents can\nreverse the order of play, meaning that the agents lead and the decision-maker\nfollows. We observe in standard learning settings that such a role reversal can\nbe desirable for both the decision-maker and the strategic agents. Finally, we\nshow that a decision-maker with the freedom to choose their update frequency\ncan induce learning dynamics that converge to Stackelberg equilibria with\neither order of play.",

    "abstract": "Reflecting on the last few years, the biggest breakthroughs in deep\nreinforcement learning (RL) have been in the discrete action domain. Robotic\nmanipulation, however, is inherently a continuous control environment, but\nthese continuous control reinforcement learning algorithms often depend on\nactor-critic methods that are sample-inefficient and inherently difficult to\ntrain, due to the joint optimisation of the actor and critic. To that end, we\nexplore how we can bring the stability of discrete action RL algorithms to the\nrobot manipulation domain. We extend the recently released ARM algorithm, by\nreplacing the continuous next-best pose agent with a discrete next-best pose\nagent. Discretisation of rotation is trivial given its bounded nature, while\ntranslation is inherently unbounded, making discretisation difficult. We\nformulate the translation prediction as the voxel prediction problem by\ndiscretising the 3D space; however, voxelisation of a large workspace is memory\nintensive and would not work with a high density of voxels, crucial to\nobtaining the resolution needed for robotic manipulation. We therefore propose\nto apply this voxel prediction in a coarse-to-fine manner by gradually\nincreasing the resolution. In each step, we extract the highest valued voxel as\nthe predicted location, which is then used as the centre of the\nhigher-resolution voxelisation in the next step. This coarse-to-fine prediction\nis applied over several steps, giving a near-lossless prediction of the\ntranslation. We show that our new coarse-to-fine algorithm is able to\naccomplish RLBench tasks much more efficiently than the continuous control\nequivalent, and even train some real-world tasks, tabular rasa, in less than 7\nminutes, with only 3 demonstrations. Moreover, we show that by moving to a\nvoxel representation, we are able to easily incorporate observations from\nmultiple cameras.",

Global Navigation Satellite Systems typically perform\npoorly in urban environments, where the likelihood of line-of-sight conditions\nbetween the devices and the satellites is low, and thus alternative\nlocalization methods are required for good accuracy. We present a deep learning\nmethod for localization, based merely on pathloss, which does not require any\nincrease in computation complexity at the user devices with respect to the\ndevice standard operations, unlike methods that rely on time of arrival or\nangle of arrival information. In a wireless network, user devices scan the base\nstation beacon slots and identify the few strongest base station signals for\nhandover and user-base station association purposes. In the proposed method,\nthe user to be localized simply reports such received signal strengths to a\ncentral processing unit, which may be located in the cloud. For each base\nstation we have good approximation of the pathloss at every location in a dense\ngrid in the map. This approximation is provided by RadioUNet, a deep\nlearning-based simulator of pathloss functions in urban environment, that we\nhave previously proposed and published. Using the estimated pathloss radio maps\nof all base stations and the corresponding reported signal strengths, the\nproposed deep learning algorithm can extract a very accurate localization of\nthe user. The proposed method, called LocUNet, enjoys high robustness to\ninaccuracies in the estimated radio maps. We demonstrate this by numerical\nexperiments, which obtain state-of-the-art results.",

    "title": "Fine-Grained Data Selection for Improved Energy Efficiency of Federated  Edge Learning",
    "abstract": "In Federated edge learning (FEEL), energy-constrained devices at the network\nedge consume significant energy when training and uploading their local machine\nlearning models, leading to a decrease in their lifetime. This work proposes\nnovel solutions for energy-efficient FEEL by jointly considering local training\ndata, available computation, and communications resources, and deadline\nconstraints of FEEL rounds to reduce energy consumption. This paper considers a\nsystem model where the edge server is equipped with multiple antennas employing\nbeamforming techniques to communicate with the local users through orthogonal\nchannels. Specifically, we consider a problem that aims to find the optimal\nuser's resources, including the fine-grained selection of relevant training\nsamples, bandwidth, transmission power, beamforming weights, and processing\nspeed with the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption given a deadline\nconstraint on the communication rounds of FEEL. Then, we devise tractable\nsolutions by first proposing a novel fine-grained training algorithm that\nexcludes less relevant training samples and effectively chooses only the\nsamples that improve the model's performance. After that, we derive closed-form\nsolutions, followed by a Golden-Section-based iterative algorithm to find the\noptimal computation and communication resources that minimize energy\nconsumption. Experiments using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed algorithms considerably outperform the state-of-the-art solutions as\nenergy consumption decreases by 79% for MNIST and 73% for CIFAR-10 datasets.",

    "abstract": "As machine learning models are increasingly used in critical decision-making\nsettings (e.g., healthcare, finance), there has been a growing emphasis on\ndeveloping methods to explain model predictions. Such \\textit{explanations} are\nused to understand and establish trust in models and are vital components in\nmachine learning pipelines.

In this paper, we discuss how two broad classes of\nexplanations are vulnerable to manipulation. We demonstrate how adversaries can\ndesign biased models that manipulate model agnostic feature attribution methods\n(e.g., LIME \\& SHAP) and counterfactual explanations that hill-climb during the\ncounterfactual search (e.g., Wachter's Algorithm \\& DiCE) into\n\\textit{concealing} the model's biases. These vulnerabilities allow an\nadversary to deploy a biased model, yet explanations will not reveal this bias,\nthereby deceiving stakeholders into trusting the model. We evaluate the\nmanipulations on real world data sets, including COMPAS and Communities \\&\nCrime, and find explanations can be manipulated in practice.",

    "abstract": "The attention module, which is a crucial component in Transformer, cannot\nscale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic complexity. Many works\nfocus on approximating the dot-then-exponentiate softmax function in the\noriginal attention, leading to sub-quadratic or even linear-complexity\nTransformer architectures. However, we show that these methods cannot be\napplied to more powerful attention modules that go beyond the\ndot-then-exponentiate style, e.g., Transformers with relative positional\nencoding (RPE). Since in many state-of-the-art models, relative positional\nencoding is used as default, designing efficient Transformers that can\nincorporate RPE is appealing. In this paper, we propose a novel way to\naccelerate attention calculation for Transformers with RPE on top of the\nkernelized attention. Based upon the observation that relative positional\nencoding forms a Toeplitz matrix, we mathematically show that kernelized\nattention with RPE can be calculated efficiently using Fast Fourier Transform\n(FFT). With FFT, our method achieves $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$ time complexity.\nInterestingly, we further demonstrate that properly using relative positional\nencoding can mitigate the training instability problem of vanilla kernelized\nattention. On a wide range of tasks, we empirically show that our models can be\ntrained from scratch without any optimization issues. The learned model\nperforms better than many efficient Transformer variants and is faster than\nstandard Transformer in the long-sequence regime.",

The recently proposed\nMessage Passing Simplicial Networks naturally decouple these elements by\nperforming message passing on the clique complex of the graph.

Although\nsignal-to-noise ratio of each time frame is usually limited by the short\nacquisition time, the correlation among different time frames can be exploited\nto improve denoising results with shared information across time frames. With\nthe success of neural networks in computer vision, supervised deep learning\nmethods show prominent performance in single-image denoising, which rely on\nlarge datasets with clean-vs-noisy image pairs. Recently, several\nself-supervised deep denoising models have been proposed, achieving promising\nresults without needing the pairwise ground truth of clean images. In the field\nof multi-image denoising, however, very few works have been done on extracting\ncorrelated information from multiple slices for denoising using self-supervised\ndeep learning methods. In this work, we propose Deformed2Self, an end-to-end\nself-supervised deep learning framework for dynamic imaging denoising. It\ncombines single-image and multi-image denoising to improve image quality and\nuse a spatial transformer network to model motion between different slices.\nFurther, it only requires a single noisy image with a few auxiliary\nobservations at different time frames for training and inference.

    "abstract": "Shapley values has established itself as one of the most appropriate and\ntheoretically sound frameworks for explaining predictions from complex machine\nlearning models. The popularity of Shapley values in the explanation setting is\nprobably due to its unique theoretical properties. The main drawback with\nShapley values, however, is that its computational complexity grows\nexponentially in the number of input features, making it unfeasible in many\nreal world situations where there could be hundreds or thousands of features.\nFurthermore, with many (dependent) features, presenting/visualizing and\ninterpreting the computed Shapley values also becomes challenging. The present\npaper introduces groupShapley: a conceptually simple approach for dealing with\nthe aforementioned bottlenecks. The idea is to group the features, for example\nby type or dependence, and then compute and present Shapley values for these\ngroups instead of for all individual features. Reducing hundreds or thousands\nof features to half a dozen or so, makes precise computations practically\nfeasible and the presentation and knowledge extraction greatly simplified. We\nprove that under certain conditions, groupShapley is equivalent to summing the\nfeature-wise Shapley values within each feature group.

We used Perlin noise, a gradient noise based mathematical\nmodel, to generate lesion-like patterns, which were then randomly pasted to the\nlung regions of normal CT images to generate pseudo COVID-19 images. The pairs\nof normal and pseudo COVID-19 images were then used to train an encoder-decoder\narchitecture based U-Net for image restoration, which does not require any\nlabelled data. The pretrained encoder was then fine-tuned using labelled data\nfor COVID-19 diagnosis task. Two public COVID-19 diagnosis datasets made up of\nCT images were employed for evaluation.

Self-calibration methods might solve this issue in an\ninterferometer formed by 3 antenna/satellite system, but the need in the 3rd\nsatellite increases mission costs.

A concept of 2-way optical\nfrequency transfer is examined to investigate its suitability to enable\nspace-to-space interferometry, in particular, to image the 'shadows' of black\nholes from space. The concept, promising on paper, has been demonstrated by\ntests. The laboratory test set-up is presented and the verification of the\ntemporal stability using standard analysis tool as TimePod is given.

The\nexperimental data sets contain signatures of long-range phenomena such as\nphysical order parameter fields, polarization and strain gradients in STEM, or\nstanding electronic waves and carrier-mediated exchange interactions in STM,\nall superimposed onto scanning system distortions and gradual changes of\ncontrast due to drift and/or mis-tilt effects. Correspondingly, while the human\neye can readily identify certain patterns in the images such as lattice\nperiodicities, repeating structural elements, or microstructures, their\nautomatic extraction and classification are highly non-trivial and universal\npathways to accomplish such analyses are absent. We pose that the most\ndistinctive elements of the patterns observed in STM and (S)TEM images are\nsimilarity and (almost-) periodicity, behaviors stemming directly from the\nparsimony of elementary atomic structures, superimposed on the gradual changes\nreflective of order parameter distributions. However, the discovery of these\nelements via global Fourier methods is non-trivial due to variability and lack\nof ideal discrete translation symmetry. To address this problem, we develop\nshift-invariant variational autoencoders (shift-VAE) that allow disentangling\ncharacteristic repeating features in the images, their variations, and shifts\ninevitable for random sampling of image space.

    "title": "Multi-modal and frequency-weighted tensor nuclear norm for hyperspectral  image denoising",
    "abstract": "Low-rankness is important in the hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising tasks.\nThe tensor nuclear norm (TNN), defined based on the tensor singular value\ndecomposition, is a state-of-the-art method to describe the low-rankness of\nHSI. However, TNN ignores some of the physical meanings of HSI in tackling the\ndenoising tasks, leading to suboptimal denoising performance. In this paper, we\npropose the multi-modal and frequency-weighted tensor nuclear norm (MFWTNN) and\nthe non-convex MFWTNN for HSI denoising tasks. Firstly, we investigate the\nphysical meaning of frequency components and reconsider their weights to\nimprove the low-rank representation ability of TNN. Meanwhile, we also consider\nthe correlation among two spatial dimensions and the spectral dimension of HSI\nand combine the above improvements to TNN to propose MFWTNN. Secondly, we use\nnon-convex functions to approximate the rank function of the frequency tensor\nand propose the NonMFWTNN to relax the MFWTNN better. Besides, we adaptively\nchoose bigger weights for slices mainly containing noise information and\nsmaller weights for slices containing profile information. Finally, we develop\nthe efficient alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) based algorithm\nto solve the proposed models, and the effectiveness of our models are\nsubstantiated in simulated and real HSI datasets.",

Stein Variational Mirror\nDescent and Mirrored Stein Variational Gradient Descent minimize the\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to constrained target distributions by\nevolving particles in a dual space defined by a mirror map. Stein Variational\nNatural Gradient exploits non-Euclidean geometry to more efficiently minimize\nthe KL divergence to unconstrained targets. We derive these samplers from a new\nclass of mirrored Stein operators and adaptive kernels developed in this work.\nWe demonstrate that these new samplers yield accurate approximations to\ndistributions on the simplex, deliver valid confidence intervals in\npost-selection inference, and converge more rapidly than prior methods in\nlarge-scale unconstrained posterior inference. Finally, we establish the\nconvergence of our new procedures under verifiable conditions on the target\ndistribution.",

    "abstract": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) results from chronic remodeling caused by\na broad range of systemic and cardiovascular disease including hypertension,\naortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and cardiac amyloidosis. Early\ndetection and characterization of LVH can significantly impact patient care but\nis limited by under-recognition of hypertrophy, measurement error and\nvariability, and difficulty differentiating etiologies of LVH. To overcome this\nchallenge, we present EchoNet-LVH - a deep learning workflow that automatically\nquantifies ventricular hypertrophy with precision equal to human experts and\npredicts etiology of LVH. Trained on 28,201 echocardiogram videos, our model\naccurately measures intraventricular wall thickness (mean absolute error [MAE]\n1.4mm, 95% CI 1.2-1.5mm), left ventricular diameter (MAE 2.4mm, 95% CI\n2.2-2.6mm), and posterior wall thickness (MAE 1.2mm, 95% CI 1.1-1.3mm) and\nclassifies cardiac amyloidosis (area under the curve of 0.83) and hypertrophic\ncardiomyopathy (AUC 0.98) from other etiologies of LVH. In external datasets\nfrom independent domestic and international healthcare systems, EchoNet-LVH\naccurately quantified ventricular parameters (R2 of 0.96 and 0.90 respectively)\nand detected cardiac amyloidosis (AUC 0.79) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n(AUC 0.89) on the domestic external validation site. Leveraging measurements\nacross multiple heart beats, our model can more accurately identify subtle\nchanges in LV geometry and its causal etiologies. Compared to human experts,\nEchoNet-LVH is fully automated, allowing for reproducible, precise\nmeasurements, and lays the foundation for precision diagnosis of cardiac\nhypertrophy. As a resource to promote further innovation, we also make publicly\navailable a large dataset of 23,212 annotated echocardiogram videos.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of learning quantum circuits of a certain\nstructure. If the unknown target is an $n$-qubit Clifford circuit, we devise an\nalgorithm to reconstruct its circuit representation by using $O(n^2)$ queries\nto it. It is unknown for decades how to handle circuits beyond the Clifford\ngroup for which the stabilizer formalism cannot be applied. Herein, we study\nquantum circuits of $T$-depth one given the all-zero state as an input. We show\nthat their output states can be represented by some stabilizer pseudomixtures.\nBy analyzing the algebraic structure of the stabilizer pseudomixture, we can\nreconstruct the output state of an unknown $T$-depth one quantum circuit on\ninput $|0^n\\rangle$ from the outcomes of Pauli measurements and Bell\nmeasurements. If the number of $T$ gates is of the order $O(\\log n)$, our\nalgorithm requires $O(n^2)$ queries. Our results greatly extend the previous\nknown facts that stabilizer states can be efficiently identified based on the\nstabilizer formalism. Hence, the proposed expanded stabilizer formalism and our\nanalysis might pave the way towards learning quantum circuits beyond the\nClifford structure.",

    "abstract": "The ultimate performance of any wireless communication system is limited by\nelectromagnetic principles and mechanisms. Motivated by this, we start from the\nfirst principles of wave propagation and consider a multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) representation of a communication system between two\nspatially-continuous volumes of arbitrary shape and position. This is the\nconcept of holographic MIMO communications. The analysis takes into account the\nelectromagnetic noise field, generated by external sources, and the constraint\non the physical radiated power. The electromagnetic MIMO model is\nparticularized for a system with parallel linear sources and receivers in\nline-of-sight conditions. Inspired by orthogonal-frequency\ndivision-multiplexing, we assume that the spatially-continuous transmit\ncurrents and received fields are represented using the Fourier basis functions.\nIn doing so, a wavenumber-division multiplexing (WDM) scheme is obtained whose\nproperties are studied with the conventional tools of linear systems theory.\nParticularly, the interplay among the different system parameters (e.g.,\ntransmission range, wavelength, and sizes of source and receiver) in terms of\nnumber of communication modes and level of interference is studied. Due to the\nnon-finite support of the electromagnetic channel, we prove that the\ninterference-free condition can only be achieved when the receiver size grows\nto infinity. The spectral efficiency of WDM is evaluated via the singular-value\ndecomposition architecture with water-filling and compared to that of a\nsimplified architecture, which uses linear processing at the receiver and\nsuboptimal power allocation.",

DR is a microvascular disease that affects the eye retina,\nwhich causes vessel blockage and therefore cuts the main source of nutrition\nfor the retina tissues. Treatment for this visual disorder is most effective\nwhen it is detected in its earliest stages, as severe DR can result in\nirreversible blindness. Nonetheless, DR identification requires the expertise\nof Ophthalmologists which is often expensive and time-consuming. Therefore,\nautomatic detection systems were introduced aiming to facilitate the\nidentification process, making it available globally in a time and\ncost-efficient manner. However, due to the limited reliable datasets and\nmedical records for this particular eye disease, the obtained predictions\naccuracies were relatively unsatisfying for eye specialists to rely on them as\ndiagnostic systems. Thus, we explored an ensemble-based learning strategy,\nmerging a substantial selection of well-known classification algorithms in one\nsophisticated diagnostic model. The proposed framework achieved the highest\naccuracy rates among all other common classification algorithms in the area. 4\nsubdatasets were generated to contain the top 5 and top 10 features of the\nMessidor dataset, selected by InfoGainEval. and WrapperSubsetEval., accuracies\nof 70.7% and 75.1% were achieved on the InfoGainEval. top 5 and original\ndataset respectively.
