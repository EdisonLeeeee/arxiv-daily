    "abstract": "A new multimodal biometric database designed and acquired within the\nframework of the European BioSecure Network of Excellence is presented. It is\ncomprised of more than 600 individuals acquired simultaneously in three\nscenarios: 1) over the Internet, 2) in an office environment with desktop PC,\nand 3) in indoor/outdoor environments with mobile portable hardware. The three\nscenarios include a common part of audio/video data. Also, signature and\nfingerprint data have been acquired both with desktop PC and mobile portable\nhardware. Additionally, hand and iris data were acquired in the second scenario\nusing desktop PC. Acquisition has been conducted by 11 European institutions.\nAdditional features of the BioSecure Multimodal Database (BMDB) are: two\nacquisition sessions, several sensors in certain modalities, balanced gender\nand age distributions, multimodal realistic scenarios with simple and quick\ntasks per modality, cross-European diversity, availability of demographic data,\nand compatibility with other multimodal databases. The novel acquisition\nconditions of the BMDB allow us to perform new challenging research and\nevaluation of either monomodal or multimodal biometric systems, as in the\nrecent BioSecure Multimodal Evaluation campaign. A description of this campaign\nincluding baseline results of individual modalities from the new database is\nalso given. The database is expected to be available for research purposes\nthrough the BioSecure Association during 2008",

    "abstract": "Automatically verifying the identity of a person by means of biometrics is an\nimportant application in day-to-day activities such as accessing banking\nservices and security control in airports. To increase the system reliability,\nseveral biometric devices are often used. Such a combined system is known as a\nmultimodal biometric system. This paper reports a benchmarking study carried\nout within the framework of the BioSecure DS2 (Access Control) evaluation\ncampaign organized by the University of Surrey, involving face, fingerprint,\nand iris biometrics for person authentication, targeting the application of\nphysical access control in a medium-size establishment with some 500 persons.\nWhile multimodal biometrics is a well-investigated subject, there exists no\nbenchmark for a fusion algorithm comparison. Working towards this goal, we\ndesigned two sets of experiments: quality-dependent and cost-sensitive\nevaluation. The quality-dependent evaluation aims at assessing how well fusion\nalgorithms can perform under changing quality of raw images principally due to\nchange of devices. The cost-sensitive evaluation, on the other hand,\ninvestigates how well a fusion algorithm can perform given restricted\ncomputation and in the presence of software and hardware failures, resulting in\nerrors such as failure-to-acquire and failure-to-match. Since multiple\ncapturing devices are available, a fusion algorithm should be able to handle\nthis nonideal but nevertheless realistic scenario. In both evaluations, each\nfusion algorithm is provided with scores from each biometric comparison\nsubsystem as well as the quality measures of both template and query data. The\nresponse to the call of the campaign proved very encouraging, with the\nsubmission of 22 fusion systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst attempt to benchmark quality-based multimodal fusion algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The success of gradient descent in ML and especially for learning neural\nnetworks is remarkable and robust. In the context of how the brain learns, one\naspect of gradient descent that appears biologically difficult to realize (if\nnot implausible) is that its updates rely on feedback from later layers to\nearlier layers through the same connections. Such bidirected links are\nrelatively few in brain networks, and even when reciprocal connections exist,\nthey may not be equi-weighted. Random Feedback Alignment (Lillicrap et al.,\n2016), where the backward weights are random and fixed, has been proposed as a\nbio-plausible alternative and found to be effective empirically. We investigate\nhow and when feedback alignment (FA) works, focusing on one of the most basic\nproblems with layered structure -- low-rank matrix factorization. In this\nproblem, given a matrix $Y_{n\\times m}$, the goal is to find a low rank\nfactorization $Z_{n \\times r}W_{r \\times m}$ that minimizes the error\n$\\|ZW-Y\\|_F$. Gradient descent solves this problem optimally. We show that FA\nconverges to the optimal solution when $r\\ge \\mbox{rank}(Y)$. We also shed\nlight on how FA works. It is observed empirically that the forward weight\nmatrices and (random) feedback matrices come closer during FA updates. Our\nanalysis rigorously derives this phenomenon and shows how it facilitates\nconvergence of FA. We also show that FA can be far from optimal when $r <\n\\mbox{rank}(Y)$. This is the first provable separation result between gradient\ndescent and FA. Moreover, the representations found by gradient descent and FA\ncan be almost orthogonal even when their error $\\|ZW-Y\\|_F$ is approximately\nequal.",

We propose a novel approach to\ncross-spectral periocular verification that primarily focuses on learning a\nmapping from visible and NIR periocular images to a shared latent\nrepresentational subspace, and supports this effort by simultaneously learning\nintra-spectral image reconstruction. We show the auxiliary image reconstruction\ntask (and in particular the reconstruction of high-level, semantic features)\nresults in learning a more discriminative, domain-invariant subspace compared\nto the baseline while incurring no additional computational or memory costs at\ntest-time. The proposed Coupled Conditional Generative Adversarial Network\n(CoGAN) architecture uses paired generator networks (one operating on visible\nimages and the other on NIR) composed of U-Nets with ResNet-18 encoders trained\nfor feature learning via contrastive loss and for intra-spectral image\nreconstruction with adversarial, pixel-based, and perceptual reconstruction\nlosses. Moreover, the proposed CoGAN model beats the current state-of-art\n(SotA) in cross-spectral periocular recognition. On the Hong Kong PolyU\nbenchmark dataset, we achieve 98.65% AUC and 5.14% EER compared to the SotA EER\nof 8.02%.

In contrast to most\ndecision-theoretic planning frameworks that assume fully known state transition\nmodels, we design a method that eliminates such a strong assumption that is\noften extremely difficult to engineer in reality. We first take the\nsecond-order Taylor expansion of the value function. The Bellman optimality\nequation is then approximated by a partial differential equation, which only\nrelies on the first and second moments of the transition model. By combining\nthe kernel representation of the value function, we then design an efficient\npolicy iteration algorithm whose policy evaluation step can be represented as a\nlinear system of equations characterized by a finite set of supporting states.\nWe first validate the proposed method through extensive simulations in $2D$\nobstacle avoidance and $2.5D$ terrain navigation problems.

In this work, we propose\na novel problem -- sequential scene flow estimation (SSFE) -- that aims to\npredict 3D scene flow for all pairs of point clouds in a given sequence. This\nis unlike the previously studied problem of scene flow estimation which focuses\non two frames.\nWe introduce the SPCM-Net architecture, which solves this problem by\ncomputing multi-scale spatiotemporal correlations between neighboring point\nclouds and then aggregating the correlation across time with an order-invariant\nrecurrent unit. Our experimental evaluation confirms that recurrent processing\nof point cloud sequences results in significantly better SSFE compared to using\nonly two frames. Additionally, we demonstrate that this approach can be\neffectively modified for sequential point cloud forecasting (SPF), a related\nproblem that demands forecasting future point cloud frames.\nOur experimental results are evaluated using a new benchmark for both SSFE\nand SPF consisting of synthetic and real datasets. Previously, datasets for\nscene flow estimation have been limited to two frames. We provide non-trivial\nextensions to these datasets for multi-frame estimation and prediction. Due to\nthe difficulty of obtaining ground truth motion for real-world datasets, we use\nself-supervised training and evaluation metrics.

In the transmitter, the\nequally likely message bits are first encoded by distribution matcher to\ngenerate amplitude symbols with the desired distribution. The binary\nrepresentations of the distribution matcher outputs are then encoded by a CRC.\nFinally, the CRC-encoded bits are encoded and modulated by Ungerboeck's TCM\nscheme, which consists of a $\\frac{k_0}{k_0+1}$ systematic tail-biting\nconvolutional code and a mapping function that maps coded bits to channel\nsignals with capacity-achieving distribution. This paper proves that, for the\nproposed transmitter, the CRC bits have uniform distribution and that the\nchannel signals have symmetric distribution. In the receiver, the serial list\nViterbi decoding (S-LVD) is used to estimate the information bits.

This is because we leverage the\nbenefits of huge amounts of data available for training, we have enormous\ncomputer processing available and we have seen the evolution of machine\nlearning as a suite of techniques to process data and deliver accurate\nvision-based systems. What kind of applications do we use this processing for ?\nWe use this in autonomous vehicle navigation or in security applications,\nsearching CCTV for example, and in medical image analysis for healthcare\ndiagnostics. One application which is not widespread is image or video search\ndirectly by users. In this paper we present the need for such image finding or\nre-finding by examining human memory and when it fails, thus motivating the\nneed for a different approach to image search which is outlined, along with the\nrequirements of computer vision to support it.",

    "abstract": "Movie trailers perform multiple functions: they introduce viewers to the\nstory, convey the mood and artistic style of the film, and encourage audiences\nto see the movie. These diverse functions make automatic trailer generation a\nchallenging endeavor. We decompose it into two subtasks: narrative structure\nidentification and sentiment prediction. We model movies as graphs, where nodes\nare shots and edges denote semantic relations between them. We learn these\nrelations using joint contrastive training which leverages privileged textual\ninformation (e.g., characters, actions, situations) from screenplays.

    "abstract": "Oblivious routing has a long history in both the theory and practice of\nnetworking. In this work we initiate the formal study of oblivious routing in\nthe context of reconfigurable networks, a new architecture that has recently\ncome to the fore in datacenter networking. These networks allow a rapidly\nchanging bounded-degree pattern of interconnections between nodes, but the\nnetwork topology and the selection of routing paths must both be oblivious to\nthe traffic demand matrix. Our focus is on the trade-off between maximizing\nthroughput and minimizing latency in these networks. For every constant\nthroughput rate, we characterize (up to a constant factor) the minimum latency\nachievable by an oblivious reconfigurable network design that satisfies the\ngiven throughput guarantee. The trade-off between these two objectives turns\nout to be surprisingly subtle: the curve depicting it has an unexpected\nscalloped shape reflecting the fact that load-balancing becomes more difficult\nwhen the average length of routing paths is not an integer because equalizing\nall the path lengths is not possible. The proof of our lower bound uses LP\nduality to verify that Valiant load balancing is the most efficient oblivious\nrouting scheme when used in combination with an optimally-designed\nreconfigurable network topology. The proof of our upper bound uses an algebraic\nconstruction in which the network nodes are identified with vectors over a\nfinite field, the network topology is described by either the elementary basis\nor a sequence of Vandermonde matrices, and routing paths are constructed by\nselecting columns of these matrices to yield the appropriate mixture of path\nlengths within the shortest possible time interval.",

    "abstract": "We present PredProp, a method for bidirectional, parallel and local\noptimisation of weights, activities and precision in neural networks. PredProp\njointly addresses inference and learning, scales learning rates dynamically and\nweights gradients by the curvature of the loss function by optimizing\nprediction error precision. PredProp optimizes network parameters with\nStochastic Gradient Descent and error forward propagation based strictly on\nprediction errors and variables locally available to each layer. Neighboring\nlayers optimise shared activity variables so that prediction errors can\npropagate forward in the network, while predictions propagate backwards. This\nprocess minimises the negative Free Energy, or evidence lower bound of the\nentire network. We show that networks trained with PredProp resemble gradient\nbased predictive coding when the number of weights between neighboring activity\nvariables is one. In contrast to related work, PredProp generalizes towards\nbackward connections of arbitrary depth and optimizes precision for any deep\nnetwork architecture. Due to the analogy between prediction error precision and\nthe Fisher information for each layer, PredProp implements a form of Natural\nGradient Descent. When optimizing DNN models, layer-wise PredProp renders the\nmodel a bidirectional predictive coding network. Alternatively DNNs can\nparameterize the weights between two activity variables. We evaluate PredProp\nfor dense DNNs on simple inference, learning and combined tasks. We show that,\nwithout an explicit sampling step in the network, PredProp implements a form of\nvariational inference that allows to learn disentangled embeddings from low\namounts of data and leave evaluation on more complex tasks and datasets to\nfuture work.",

In this paper, we study\nwhether exploiting the CDF-based learned models to boost the join performance\nis practical or not. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to fill\nthis gap. We investigate the usage of CDF-based partitioning and learned\nindexes (e.g., RMI and RadixSpline) in the three join categories; indexed\nnested loop join(INLJ), sort-based joins (SJ) and hash-based joins (HJ). We\nproposed new efficient learned variants for the INLJ and SJ categories. In\naddition, we proposed a reinforcement learning based optimizer to select the\nbest join algorithm, whether learned or not-learned, for each join query. Our\nexperimental analysis showed that our learned joins variants of INLJ and SJ\nconsistently outperform the state-of-the-art techniques.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesize that the present expansion of energy generation by variable\nrenewable energy (VRE) power plants, such as wind and photovoltaic power\nplants, leads to a 100% renewable energy supply in 2030 because of its inherent\nexponential growth function. This behavior is related to the exponential cost\nreduction of its generated energy and the nearly unconstrained available\npotential of its natural resources. The cost reduction results from the\ncontinuous improvements in development, research, manufacturing, and\ninstallation, also showing a growth of its installation power per power plant\nor aero generator. We prove that if the historic exponential growth is followed\nin the future, it is possible to decarbonize the world's electric energy\nsystems' power supply in 2026. Furthermore, the global demand on primary energy\ncan be supplied in 2030, which leads to the total suppression of CO2 emissions\nrelated to the energy need of humanity. Because of the related cost reduction,\nenergy costs are not anymore relevant. Our extrapolation is based on the\ncontinuation of the historic growth functions of the globally installed PV and\nthe wind power plants, and we also discuss the conditions necessary to enable a\ntransition to such a 100% renewable energy production. Considering a\nnon-constrained growth of VRE power plants' installation power, decarbonization\nrelated to energy generation and use can be accomplished in a much shorter time\nframe as previously scheduled. As a result, climate change mitigation, energy\ncost reduction, and high employment are attained much earlier than previously\nplanned.",

However,\nmany real-world prediction problems have ordinal response variables, and this\nordering information is ignored by conventional classification losses such as\nthe multi-category cross-entropy. Ordinal regression methods for deep neural\nnetworks address this. One such method is the CORAL method, which is based on\nan earlier binary label extension framework and achieves rank consistency among\nits output layer tasks by imposing a weight-sharing constraint. However, while\nearlier experiments showed that CORAL's rank consistency is beneficial for\nperformance, the weight-sharing constraint could severely restrict the\nexpressiveness of a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose an\nalternative method for rank-consistent ordinal regression that does not require\na weight-sharing constraint in a neural network's fully connected output layer.\nWe achieve this rank consistency by a novel training scheme using conditional\ntraining sets to obtain the unconditional rank probabilities through applying\nthe chain rule for conditional probability distributions. Experiments on\nvarious datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method to utilize the\nordinal target information, and the absence of the weight-sharing restriction\nimproves the performance substantially compared to the CORAL reference\napproach.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, abstraction-based controller synthesis techniques have\ngained considerable attention due to their ability to synthesize\ncorrect-by-design feedback controllers from high-level specifications.\nNevertheless, a significant drawback of these techniques is the need to explore\nlarge spaces of quantized state and input spaces to find a controller that\nsatisfies the specification. On the contrary, recent advances in machine\nlearning, in particular imitation learning and reinforcement learning, paved\nthe way to several techniques to design controllers (or policies) for highly\nnonlinear systems with large state and input spaces, albeit their lack of\nrigorous correctness guarantees. This motivates the question of how to use\nmachine learning techniques to guide the synthesis of abstraction-based\ncontrollers. In this paper, we introduce NNSynth, a novel tool for\nabstraction-based controller synthesis. Unique to NNSynth is the use of machine\nlearning techniques to guide the search over the space of controllers to find\ncandidate Neural Network (NN)-based controllers. Next, these NNs are\n\"projected\" and the control actions that are close to the NN outputs are used\nto construct a \"local\" abstraction for the system. An abstraction-based\ncontroller is then synthesized from such a \"local\" abstract model. If a\ncontroller that satisfies the specifications is not found, then the best found\ncontroller is \"lifted\" to a neural network controller for additional training.\nOur experiments show that this neural network-guided synthesis leads to more\nthan 50x or even 100x speedup in high dimensional systems compared to the\nstate-of-the-art.",

It is thus crucial to comprehensively test the fairness of these\napplications before deployment. Existing fairness testing methods suffer from\nthe following limitations: 1) applicability, i.e., they are only applicable for\nstructured data or text without handling the high-dimensional and abstract\ndomain sampling in the semantic level for image classification applications; 2)\nfunctionality, i.e., they generate unfair samples without providing testing\ncriterion to characterize the model's fairness adequacy. To fill the gap, we\npropose DeepFAIT, a systematic fairness testing framework specifically designed\nfor deep image classification applications. DeepFAIT consists of several\nimportant components enabling effective fairness testing of deep image\nclassification applications: 1) a neuron selection strategy to identify the\nfairness-related neurons; 2) a set of multi-granularity adequacy metrics to\nevaluate the model's fairness; 3) a test selection algorithm for fixing the\nfairness issues efficiently.

    "abstract": "Adversarially robust training has been shown to reduce the susceptibility of\nlearned models to targeted input data perturbations. However, it has also been\nobserved that such adversarially robust models suffer a degradation in accuracy\nwhen applied to unperturbed data sets, leading to a robustness-accuracy\ntradeoff. In this paper, we provide sharp and interpretable characterizations\nof such robustness-accuracy tradeoffs for linear inverse problems. In\nparticular, we provide an algorithm to find the optimal adversarial\nperturbation given data, and develop tight upper and lower bounds on the\nadversarial loss in terms of the standard (non-adversarial) loss and the\nspectral properties of the resulting estimator. Further, motivated by the use\nof adversarial training in reinforcement learning, we define and analyze the\n\\emph{adversarially robust Kalman Filtering problem.} We apply a refined\nversion of our general theory to this problem, and provide the first\ncharacterization of robustness-accuracy tradeoffs in a setting where the data\nis generated by a dynamical system. In doing so, we show a natural connection\nbetween a filter's robustness to adversarial perturbation and underlying\ncontrol theoretic properties of the system being observed, namely the spectral\nproperties of its observability gramian.",

    "abstract": "Timely handgun detection is a crucial problem to improve public safety;\nnevertheless, the effectiveness of many surveillance systems still depend of\nfinite human attention. Much of the previous research on handgun detection is\nbased on static image detectors, leaving aside valuable temporal information\nthat could be used to improve object detection in videos. To improve the\nperformance of surveillance systems, a real-time temporal handgun detection\nsystem should be built. Using Temporal Yolov5, an architecture based in\nQuasi-Recurrent Neural Networks, temporal information is extracted from video\nto improve the results of the handgun detection. Moreover, two publicity\navailable datasets are proposed, labeled with hands, guns, and phones. One\ncontaining 2199 static images to train static detectors, and another with 5960\nframes of videos to train temporal modules. Additionally, we explore two\ntemporal data augmentation techniques based in Mosaic and Mixup. The resulting\nsystems are three temporal architectures: one focused in reducing inference\nwith a mAP$_{50:95}$ of 56.1, another in having a good balance between\ninference and accuracy with a mAP$_{50:95}$ of 59.4, and a last one specialized\nin accuracy with a mAP$_{50:95}$ of 60.2. Temporal Yolov5 achieves real-time\ndetection in the small and medium architectures. Moreover, it takes advantage\nof temporal features contained in videos to perform better than Yolov5 in our\ntemporal dataset, making TYolov5 suitable for real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Remotely sensed geospatial data are critical for applications including\nprecision agriculture, urban planning, disaster monitoring and response, and\nclimate change research, among others. Deep learning methods are particularly\npromising for modeling many remote sensing tasks given the success of deep\nneural networks in similar computer vision tasks and the sheer volume of\nremotely sensed imagery available. However, the variance in data collection\nmethods and handling of geospatial metadata make the application of deep\nlearning methodology to remotely sensed data nontrivial. For example, satellite\nimagery often includes additional spectral bands beyond red, green, and blue\nand must be joined to other geospatial data sources that can have differing\ncoordinate systems, bounds, and resolutions. To help realize the potential of\ndeep learning for remote sensing applications, we introduce TorchGeo, a Python\nlibrary for integrating geospatial data into the PyTorch deep learning\necosystem. TorchGeo provides data loaders for a variety of benchmark datasets,\ncomposable datasets for generic geospatial data sources, samplers for\ngeospatial data, and transforms that work with multispectral imagery. TorchGeo\nis also the first library to provide pre-trained models for multispectral\nsatellite imagery (e.g. models that use all bands from the Sentinel 2\nsatellites), allowing for advances in transfer learning on downstream remote\nsensing tasks with limited labeled data. We use TorchGeo to create reproducible\nbenchmark results on existing datasets and benchmark our proposed method for\npreprocessing geospatial imagery on-the-fly.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of data in the recent years has led to the development of\ncomplex learning algorithms that are often used to make decisions in real\nworld. While the positive impact of the algorithms has been tremendous, there\nis a need to mitigate any bias arising from either training samples or implicit\nassumptions made about the data samples. This need becomes critical when\nalgorithms are used in automated decision making systems that can hugely impact\npeople's lives.\nMany approaches have been proposed to make learning algorithms fair by\ndetecting and mitigating bias in different stages of optimization. However, due\nto a lack of a universal definition of fairness, these algorithms optimize for\na particular interpretation of fairness which makes them limited for real world\nuse. Moreover, an underlying assumption that is common to all algorithms is the\napparent equivalence of achieving fairness and removing bias. In other words,\nthere is no user defined criteria that can be incorporated into the\noptimization procedure for producing a fair algorithm. Motivated by these\nshortcomings of existing methods, we propose the FAIRLEARN procedure that\nproduces a fair algorithm by incorporating user constraints into the\noptimization procedure. Furthermore, we make the process interpretable by\nestimating the most predictive features from data.

    "abstract": "With the growing reliability of modern Ad Hoc Networks, it is encouraging to\nanalyze potential involvement of autonomous Ad Hoc agents in critical\nsituations where human involvement could be perilous. One such critical\nscenario is the Search and Rescue effort in the event of a disaster where\ntimely discovery and help deployment is of utmost importance. This paper\ndemonstrates the applicability of a bio-inspired technique, namely Ant\nAlgorithms (AA), in optimizing the search time for a near optimal path to a\ntrapped victim, followed by the application of Dijkstra's algorithm in the\nrescue phase. The inherent exploratory nature of AA is put to use for a faster\nmapping and coverage of the unknown search space. Four different AA are\nimplemented, with different effects of the pheromone in play. An inverted AA,\nwith repulsive pheromones, was found to be the best fit for this particular\napplication. After considerable exploration, upon discovery of the victim, the\nautonomous agents further facilitate the rescue process by forming a relay\nnetwork, using the already deployed resources. Hence, the paper discusses a\ndetailed decision making model of the swarm, segmented into two primary phases,\nresponsible for the search and rescue respectively. Different aspects of the\nperformance of the agent swarm are analyzed, as a function of the spatial\ndimensions, the complexity of the search space, the deployed search group size,\nand the signal permeability of the obstacles in the area.",

Our method is based purely on\nthe notions from differential geometry of curves and surfaces and avoids any\nphysical simulations. In particular, we introduce a well-defined elastic grid\nenergy functional that allows identifying networks of curves that minimize the\nbending energy and at the same time nestle to the provided input surface well.\nFurther, we generalize the concept of such grids to cases where the surface\nboundary does not need to be convex, which allows for the creation of\nsophisticated and visually pleasing shapes.

    "abstract": "Deep learning algorithms have recently achieved promising deraining\nperformances on both the natural and synthetic rainy datasets. As an essential\nlow-level pre-processing stage, a deraining network should clear the rain\nstreaks and preserve the fine semantic details. However, most existing methods\nonly consider low-level image restoration. That limits their performances at\nhigh-level tasks requiring precise semantic information. To address this issue,\nin this paper, we present a segmentation-aware progressive network (SAPNet)\nbased upon contrastive learning for single image deraining. We start our method\nwith a lightweight derain network formed with progressive dilated units (PDU).\nThe PDU can significantly expand the receptive field and characterize\nmulti-scale rain streaks without the heavy computation on multi-scale images. A\nfundamental aspect of this work is an unsupervised background segmentation\n(UBS) network initialized with ImageNet and Gaussian weights. The UBS can\nfaithfully preserve an image's semantic information and improve the\ngeneralization ability to unseen photos. Furthermore, we introduce a perceptual\ncontrastive loss (PCL) and a learned perceptual image similarity loss (LPISL)\nto regulate model learning. By exploiting the rainy image and groundtruth as\nthe negative and the positive sample in the VGG-16 latent space, we bridge the\nfine semantic details between the derained image and the groundtruth in a fully\nconstrained manner. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world rainy\nimages show our model surpasses top-performing methods and aids object\ndetection and semantic segmentation with considerable efficacy.

    "title": "A GNN-RNN Approach for Harnessing Geospatial and Temporal Information:  Application to Crop Yield Prediction",
    "abstract": "Climate change is posing new challenges to crop-related concerns including\nfood insecurity, supply stability and economic planning. As one of the central\nchallenges, crop yield prediction has become a pressing task in the machine\nlearning field. Despite its importance, the prediction task is exceptionally\ncomplicated since crop yields depend on various factors such as weather, land\nsurface, soil quality as well as their interactions. In recent years, machine\nlearning models have been successfully applied in this domain. However, these\nmodels either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region, or only study\nover a single or few years, which makes them hard to generalize spatially and\ntemporally. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent neural\nnetwork for crop yield prediction, to incorporate both geographical and\ntemporal knowledge in the model, and further boost predictive power. Our method\nis trained, validated, and tested on over 2000 counties from 41 states in the\nUS mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019. As far as we know, this is the\nfirst machine learning method that embeds geographical knowledge in crop yield\nprediction and predicts the crop yields at county level nationwide. We also\nlaid a solid foundation for the comparison with other machine learning\nbaselines by applying well-known linear models, tree-based models, deep\nlearning methods and comparing their performance. Experiments show that our\nproposed method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods\non various metrics, validating the effectiveness of geospatial and temporal\ninformation.",

    "abstract": "Automated Scoring (AS), the natural language processing task of scoring\nessays and speeches in an educational testing setting, is growing in popularity\nand being deployed across contexts from government examinations to companies\nproviding language proficiency services. However, existing systems either forgo\nhuman raters entirely, thus harming the reliability of the test, or score every\nresponse by both human and machine thereby increasing costs. We target the\nspectrum of possible solutions in between, making use of both humans and\nmachines to provide a higher quality test while keeping costs reasonable to\ndemocratize access to AS. In this work, we propose a combination of the\nexisting paradigms, sampling responses to be scored by humans intelligently. We\npropose reward sampling and observe significant gains in accuracy (19.80%\nincrease on average) and quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) (25.60% on average)\nwith a relatively small human budget (30% samples) using our proposed sampling.\nThe accuracy increase observed using standard random and importance sampling\nbaselines are 8.6% and 12.2% respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate the\nsystem's model agnostic nature by measuring its performance on a variety of\nmodels currently deployed in an AS setting as well as pseudo models. Finally,\nwe propose an algorithm to estimate the accuracy/QWK with statistical\nguarantees (Our code is available at https://git.io/J1IOy).",

    "abstract": "Multimodal emotion recognition is a challenging task in emotion computing as\nit is quite difficult to extract discriminative features to identify the subtle\ndifferences in human emotions with abstract concept and multiple expressions.\nMoreover, how to fully utilize both audio and visual information is still an\nopen problem. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal fusion attention\nnetwork for audio-visual emotion recognition based on adaptive and multi-level\nfactorized bilinear pooling (FBP). First, for the audio stream, a fully\nconvolutional network (FCN) equipped with 1-D attention mechanism and local\nresponse normalization is designed for speech emotion recognition. Next, a\nglobal FBP (G-FBP) approach is presented to perform audio-visual information\nfusion by integrating selfattention based video stream with the proposed audio\nstream. To improve G-FBP, an adaptive strategy (AG-FBP) to dynamically\ncalculate the fusion weight of two modalities is devised based on the\nemotion-related representation vectors from the attention mechanism of\nrespective modalities. Finally, to fully utilize the local emotion information,\nadaptive and multi-level FBP (AMFBP) is introduced by combining both\nglobal-trunk and intratrunk data in one recording on top of AG-FBP. Tested on\nthe IEMOCAP corpus for speech emotion recognition with only audio stream, the\nnew FCN method outperforms the state-ofthe-art results with an accuracy of\n71.40%. Moreover, validated on the AFEW database of EmotiW2019 sub-challenge\nand the IEMOCAP corpus for audio-visual emotion recognition, the proposed\nAM-FBP approach achieves the best accuracy of 63.09% and 75.49% respectively on\nthe test set.",

    "abstract": "We study fast rates of convergence in the setting of nonparametric online\nregression, namely where regret is defined with respect to an arbitrary\nfunction class which has bounded complexity. Our contributions are two-fold:\n- In the realizable setting of nonparametric online regression with the\nabsolute loss, we propose a randomized proper learning algorithm which gets a\nnear-optimal mistake bound in terms of the sequential fat-shattering dimension\nof the hypothesis class. In the setting of online classification with a class\nof Littlestone dimension $d$, our bound reduces to $d \\cdot {\\rm poly} \\log T$.\nThis result answers a question as to whether proper learners could achieve\nnear-optimal mistake bounds; previously, even for online classification, the\nbest known mistake bound was $\\tilde O( \\sqrt{dT})$. Further, for the\nreal-valued (regression) setting, the optimal mistake bound was not even known\nfor improper learners, prior to this work.\n- Using the above result, we exhibit an independent learning algorithm for\ngeneral-sum binary games of Littlestone dimension $d$, for which each player\nachieves regret $\\tilde O(d^{3/4} \\cdot T^{1/4})$. This result generalizes\nanalogous results of Syrgkanis et al.

For example, there are estimated more than 40 different kinds of\nretinal diseases with variable morbidity, however with more than 30+ conditions\nare very rare from the global patient cohorts, which results in a typical\nlong-tailed learning problem for deep learning-based screening models.\nMoreover, there may exist more than one kind of disease on the retina, which\nresults in a multi-label scenario and bring label co-occurrence issue for\nre-sampling strategy. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages\nthe prior knowledge in retinal diseases for training a more robust\nrepresentation of the model under a hierarchy-sensible constraint.

However, they have some\ninsuperable drawbacks, e.g., they cannot handle videos without references, and\nthey may result in biased evaluation due to the one-to-many nature of\nvideo-to-text and the neglect of visual relevance. From the human evaluator's\nviewpoint, a high-quality caption should be consistent with the provided video,\nbut not necessarily be similar to the reference in literal or semantics.\nInspired by human evaluation, we propose EMScore (Embedding Matching-based\nscore), a novel reference-free metric for video captioning, which directly\nmeasures similarity between video and candidate captions. Benefit from the\nrecent development of large-scale pre-training models, we exploit a well\npre-trained vision-language model to extract visual and linguistic embeddings\nfor computing EMScore. Specifically, EMScore combines matching scores of both\ncoarse-grained (video and caption) and fine-grained (frames and words) levels,\nwhich takes the overall understanding and detailed characteristics of the video\ninto account. Furthermore, considering the potential information gain, EMScore\ncan be flexibly extended to the conditions where human-labeled references are\navailable.

    "title": "CAMIG: Concurrency-Aware Live Migration Management of Multiple Virtual  Machines in SDN-enabled Clouds",
    "abstract": "By integrating Software-Defined Networking and cloud computing, virtualized\nnetworking and computing resources can be dynamically reallocated through live\nmigration of Virtual Machines (VMs). Dynamic resource management such as load\nbalancing and energy-saving policies can request multiple migrations when the\nalgorithms are triggered periodically. There exist notable research efforts in\ndynamic resource management that alleviate single migration overheads, such as\nsingle migration time and co-location interference while selecting the\npotential VMs and migration destinations. However, by neglecting the resource\ndependency among potential migration requests, the existing solutions of\ndynamic resource management can result in the Quality of Service (QoS)\ndegradation and Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during the migration\nschedule. Therefore, it is essential to integrate both single and multiple\nmigration overheads into VM reallocation planning. In this paper, we propose a\nconcurrency-aware multiple migration selector that operates based on the\nmaximal cliques and independent sets of the resource dependency graph of\nmultiple migration requests. Our proposed method can be integrated with\nexisting dynamic resource management policies. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that our solution efficiently minimizes migration interference and\nshortens the convergence time of reallocation by maximizing the multiple\nmigration performance while achieving the objective of dynamic resource\nmanagement.",

This paper raises the following\nquestions: (i) can we unlearn a class/classes of data from a ML model without\nlooking at the full training data even once? (ii) can we make the process of\nunlearning fast and scalable to large datasets, and generalize it to different\ndeep networks? We introduce a novel machine unlearning framework with\nerror-maximizing noise generation and impair-repair based weight manipulation\nthat offers an efficient solution to the above questions. An error-maximizing\nnoise matrix is learned for the class to be unlearned using the original model.\nThe noise matrix is used to manipulate the model weights to unlearn the\ntargeted class of data. We introduce impair and repair steps for a controlled\nmanipulation of the network weights. In the impair step, the noise matrix along\nwith a very high learning rate is used to induce sharp unlearning in the model.\nThereafter, the repair step is used to regain the overall performance. With\nvery few update steps, we show excellent unlearning while substantially\nretaining the overall model accuracy. Unlearning multiple classes requires a\nsimilar number of update steps as for the single class, making our approach\nscalable to large problems. Our method is quite efficient in comparison to the\nexisting methods, works for multi-class unlearning, doesn't put any constraints\non the original optimization mechanism or network design, and works well in\nboth small and large-scale vision tasks. This work is an important step towards\nfast and easy implementation of unlearning in deep networks. We will make the\nsource code publicly available.",

Currently, the real-time\nJoint-Detection-Tracking (JDT) based MOT trackers gain increasing attention and\nderive many excellent models. However, the robustness of JDT trackers is rarely\nstudied, and it is challenging to attack the MOT system since its mature\nassociation algorithms are designed to be robust against errors during\ntracking. In this work, we analyze the weakness of JDT trackers and propose a\nnovel adversarial attack method, called Tracklet-Switch (TraSw), against the\ncomplete tracking pipeline of MOT. Specifically, a push-pull loss and a center\nleaping optimization are designed to generate adversarial examples for both\nre-ID feature and object detection. TraSw can fool the tracker to fail to track\nthe targets in the subsequent frames by attacking very few frames. We evaluate\nour method on the advanced deep trackers (i.e., FairMOT, JDE, ByteTrack) using\nthe MOT-Challenge datasets (i.e., 2DMOT15, MOT17, and MOT20). Experiments show\nthat TraSw can achieve a high success rate of over 95% by attacking only five\nframes on average for the single-target attack and a reasonably high success\nrate of over 80% for the multiple-target attack.

The DED2D system allows a base\nstation (BS) to transfer data to information-demanded users (IUs) and energy to\nenergy-demanded users (EUs), i.e., using a time-fraction-based information and\nenergy transfer (TFIET) scheme. Furthermore, the DED2D system enables D2D\ncommunications to share spectrum with the BS. Therefore, the DED2D system\naddresses the growth of energy and spectrum demands of the next generation\nnetworks. However, the interference caused by the D2D communications and\npropagation loss of wireless links can significantly degrade the data\nthroughput of IUs. To deal with the issues, we propose to deploy an intelligent\nreflecting surface (IRS) in the DED2D system. Then, we formulate an\noptimization problem that aims to optimize the information beamformer for the\nIUs, energy beamformer for EUs, time fractions of the TFIET, transmit power of\nD2D transmitters, and reflection coefficients of the IRS to maximize IUs' worse\nthroughput while satisfying the harvested energy requirement of EUs and D2D\nrate threshold.

Also, recent studies show that ASD teams\nare affected by the switch to remote work since the Covid 19 pandemic outbreak\nin 2020. Objective: Our study presents empirical findings on the effects on ASD\nteams operating remote in a 4-day work week organization. Method: We performed\na qualitative single case study and conducted seven semi-structured interviews,\nobserved 14 agile practices and screened eight project documents and protocols\nof agile practices. Results: We found, that the teams adapted the agile method\nin use due to the change to a 4-day work week environment and the switch to\nremote work.

These attacks need to restrict perturbations of adversarial examples\nwithin a strict bound, leading to the unrealistic adversarial 3D point clouds.\nIn this paper, we propose an Adversarial Graph-Convolutional Generative\nAdversarial Network (AdvGCGAN) to generate visually realistic adversarial 3D\npoint clouds from scratch. Specifically, we use a graph convolutional generator\nand a discriminator with an auxiliary classifier to generate realistic point\nclouds, which learn the latent distribution from the real 3D data. The\nunrestricted adversarial attack loss is incorporated in the special adversarial\ntraining of GAN, which enables the generator to generate the adversarial\nexamples to spoof the target network. Compared with the existing state-of-art\nattack methods, the experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nunrestricted adversarial attack methods with a higher attack success rate and\nvisual quality.

To facilitate the efficiency and effectiveness of contrastive\nlearning, we construct an exemplar dictionary with representative pedestrian\nappearances as prior knowledge to construct effective contrastive training\npairs and thus guide contrastive learning. Besides, the constructed exemplar\ndictionary is further leveraged to evaluate the quality of pedestrian proposals\nduring inference by measuring the semantic distance between the proposal and\nthe exemplar dictionary.

    "abstract": "Spanners have been shown to be a powerful tool in graph algorithms. Many\nspanner constructions use a certain type of clustering at their core, where\neach cluster has small diameter and there are relatively few spanner edges\nbetween clusters. In this paper, we provide a clustering algorithm that, given\n$k\\geq 2$, can be used to compute a spanner of stretch $2k-1$ and expected size\n$O(n^{1+1/k})$ in $k$ rounds in the CONGEST model. This improves upon the state\nof the art (by Elkin, and Neiman [TALG'19]) by making the bounds on both\nrunning time and stretch independent of the random choices of the algorithm,\nwhereas they only hold with high probability in previous results. Spanners are\nused in certain synchronizers, thus our improvement directly carries over to\nsuch synchronizers. Furthermore, for keeping the \\emph{total} number of\ninter-cluster edges small in low diameter decompositions, our clustering\nalgorithm provides the following guarantees.

    "abstract": "The evolution of high-performance computing is associated with the growth of\nenergy consumption. Performance of cluster computes (is increased via rising in\nperformance and the number of used processors, GPUs, and coprocessors. An\nincrement in the number of computing elements results in significant growth of\nenergy consumption. Power grids limits for supercomputer centers (SCC) are\ndriving the transition to more energy-efficient solutions. Often upgrade of\ncomputing resources is done step-by-step, i.e. parts of older supercomputers\nare removed from service and replaced with newer ones. A single SCC at any time\ncan operate several computing systems with different performance and power\nconsumption. That is why the problem of scheduling parallel programs execution\non SCC resources to optimize energy consumption and minimize the increase in\nexecution time (energy-efficient scheduling) is important. The goal of the\npresented work was the development of a new energy-efficient algorithm for\nscheduling computing resources at SCC. To reach the goal the authors analyzed\nmethods of scheduling computing resources in a shared facility, including\nenergy consumption minimizing methods. The study made it possible to formulate\nthe problem of energy-efficient scheduling for a set of CCs and propose an\nalgorithm for its solution. Experiments on NPB benchmarks allowed achieving\nsignificant reduction in energy consumption with a minor increase of runtime.",

    "abstract": "In anisotropic media, the standard perfectly matched layer (PML) technique\nsuffers irrevocable instability in terminating the unbounded problem domains.\nIt remains an open question whether a stable PML-like absorbing boundary\ncondition exists. For wave scattering in a layered orthotropic medium, this\nquestion is affirmatively answered for the first time in this paper. In each\northotropic medium, the permittivity tensor uniquely determines a change of\ncoordinates, that transforms the governing anisotropic Helmholtz equation into\nan isotropic Helmholtz equation in the new coordinate system. This leads us to\npropose a novel Sommerfeld radiation condition (SRC) to rigorously characterize\noutgoing waves in the layered orthotropic medium. Naturally, the SRC motivates\na regionalized PML (RPML) to truncate the scattering problem, in the sense that\na standard PML is set up in the new coordinate system in each orthotropic\nregion. It is revealed that the RPML is unconditionally stable compared with\nthe unstable uniaxial PML. A high-accuracy boundary integral equation (BIE)\nmethod is developed to solve the resulting boundary value problem. Numerical\nexperiments are carried out to validate the stability of the RPML and the\naccuracy of the BIE method, showing exponentially decaying truncation errors as\nthe RPML parameters increase.",

    "abstract": "In the field of deep-sea exploration, sonar is presently the only efficient\nlong-distance sensing device. The complicated underwater environment, such as\nnoise interference, low target intensity or background dynamics, has brought\nmany negative effects on sonar imaging. Among them, the problem of nonlinear\nintensity is extremely prevalent. It is also known as the anisotropy of\nacoustic imaging, that is, when AUVs carry sonar to detect the same target from\ndifferent angles, the intensity difference between image pairs is sometimes\nvery large, which makes the traditional matching algorithm almost ineffective.\nHowever, image matching is the basis of comprehensive tasks such as navigation,\npositioning, and mapping. Therefore, it is very valuable to obtain robust and\naccurate matching results. This paper proposes a combined matching method based\non phase information and deep convolution features. It has two outstanding\nadvantages: one is that deep convolution features could be used to measure the\nsimilarity of the local and global positions of the sonar image; the other is\nthat local feature matching could be performed at the key target position of\nthe sonar image. This method does not need complex manual design, and completes\nthe matching task of nonlinear intensity sonar images in a close end-to-end\nmanner. Feature matching experiments are carried out on the deep-sea sonar\nimages captured by AUVs, and the results show that our proposal has good\nmatching accuracy and robustness.",

The workers repeatedly\npick tasks and execute them to completion. Each task is sequential, with\npossibly recursive code, and tasks communicate over shared memory. Executing a\ntask can lead to more new tasks being spawned. We consider the safety\nverification problem for thread-pooled programs. We parameterize the problem\nwith two parameters: the size of the thread pool as well as the number of\ncontext switches for each task. The size of the thread pool determines the\nnumber of workers running concurrently. The number of context switches\ndetermines how many times a worker can be swapped out while executing a single\ntask - like many verification problems for multithreaded recursive programs,\nthe context bounding is important for decidability.\nWe show that the safety verification problem for thread-pooled,\ncontext-bounded, Boolean programs is EXPSPACE-complete, even if the size of the\nthread pool and the context bound are given in binary. Our main result, the\nEXPSPACE upper bound, is derived using a sequence of new succinct encoding\ntechniques of independent language-theoretic interest. In particular, we show a\npolynomial-time construction of downward closures of languages accepted by\nsuccinct pushdown automata as doubly succinct nondeterministic finite automata.\nWhile there are explicit doubly exponential lower bounds on the size of\nnondeterministic finite automata accepting the downward closure, our result\nshows these automata can be compressed.

HSIM uses these eigenpairs as initialization\nand iterates from coarse to fine over the hierarchy. On each level, subspace\niterations, initialized with the solution from the previous level, are used to\napproximate the eigenpairs. This approach substantially reduces the number of\niterations needed on the finest grid compared to the non-hierarchical Subspace\nIteration Method. Our experiments show that HSIM can solve Laplace--Beltrami\neigenproblems on meshes faster than state-of-the-art methods based on Lanczos\niterations, preconditioned conjugate gradients and subspace iterations.",

    "title": "Average reduced model to simulate solutions for heat and mass transfer  through porous material",
    "abstract": "The design of numerical tools to model the behavior of building materials is\na challenging task. The crucial point is to save computational cost and\nmaintain high accuracy of predictions. There are two main limitations on the\ntime scale choice, which put an obstacle to solve the above issues. First one\nis the numerical restriction. A number of research is dedicated to overcome\nthis limitation and it is shown that it can be relaxed with innovative\nnumerical schemes. The second one is the physical restriction. It is imposed by\nproperties of a material, phenomena itself and corresponding boundary\nconditions. This work is focused on the study of a methodology that enables to\novercome the physical restriction on the time grid. So-called Average Reduced\nModel (ARM) is suggested. It is based on smoothing the time-dependent boundary\nconditions. Besides, the approximate solution is decomposed into average and\nfluctuating components. The primer is obtained by integrating the equations\nover time, whereas the latter is an user-defined empirical model. The\nmethodology is investigated for both heat diffusion and coupled heat and mass\ntransfer. It is demonstrated that the signal core of the boundary conditions is\npreserved and the physical restriction can be relaxed. The model proved to be\nreliable, accurate and efficient also in comparison with the experimental data\nof two years. The implementation of the scarce time-step of $1 \\, \\sf{h}$ is\njustified.\nIt is shown, that by maintaining the tolerable error it is possible to cut\ncomputational effort up to almost four times in comparison with the complete\nmodel with the same time grid.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the usage of ensemble learning in applications has grown\nsignificantly due to increasing computational power allowing the training of\nlarge ensembles in reasonable time frames. Many applications, e.g., malware\ndetection, face recognition, or financial decision-making, use a finite set of\nlearning algorithms and do aggregate them in a way that a better predictive\nperformance is obtained than any other of the individual learning algorithms.\nIn the field of Post-Silicon Validation for semiconductor devices (PSV), data\nsets are typically provided that consist of various devices like, e.g., chips\nof different manufacturing lines. In PSV, the task is to approximate the\nunderlying function of the data with multiple learning algorithms, each trained\non a device-specific subset, instead of improving the performance of arbitrary\nclassifiers on the entire data set. Furthermore, the expectation is that an\nunknown number of subsets describe functions showing very different\ncharacteristics. Corresponding ensemble members, which are called outliers, can\nheavily influence the approximation. Our method aims to find a suitable\napproximation that is robust to outliers and represents the best or worst case\nin a way that will apply to as many types as possible. A 'soft-max' or\n'soft-min' function is used in place of a maximum or minimum operator. A Neural\nNetwork (NN) is trained to learn this 'soft-function' in a two-stage process.\nFirst, we select a subset of ensemble members that is representative of the\nbest or worst case. Second, we combine these members and define a weighting\nthat uses the properties of the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) to increase the\ninfluence of non-outliers and to decrease outliers. The weighting ensures\nrobustness to outliers and makes sure that approximations are suitable for most\ntypes.",

In traditional\nlocal planners, obstacles are usually considered insurmountable, so the robot\nteam bypasses the obstacles as a whole. However, many obstacles can be crossed\nin real situation. Studying the obstacle crossing ability of robot team can\nimprove the efficiency of MRT and increase the planning success rate in complex\nenvironment.

    "title": "Do Not Trust Prediction Scores for Membership Inference Attacks",
    "abstract": "Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific\nsample was used to train a predictive model. Knowing this may indeed lead to a\nprivacy breach. Arguably, most MIAs, however, make use of the model's\nprediction scores - the probability of each output given some input - following\nthe intuition that the trained model tends to behave differently on its\ntraining data. We argue that this is a fallacy for many modern deep network\narchitectures, e.g., ReLU type neural networks produce almost always high\nprediction scores far away from the training data. Consequently, MIAs will\nmiserably fail since this behavior leads to high false-positive rates not only\non known domains but also on out-of-distribution data and implicitly acts as a\ndefense against MIAs. Specifically, using generative adversarial networks, we\nare able to produce a potentially infinite number of samples falsely classified\nas part of the training data. In other words, the threat of MIAs is\noverestimated and less information is leaked than previously assumed. Moreover,\nthere is actually a trade-off between the overconfidence of classifiers and\ntheir susceptibility to MIAs: the more classifiers know when they do not know,\nmaking low confidence predictions far away from the training data, the more\nthey reveal the training data.",

    "abstract": "Benefiting from the strong ability of the pre-trained model, the research on\nChinese Word Segmentation (CWS) has made great progress in recent years.\nHowever, due to massive computation, large and complex models are incapable of\nempowering their ability for industrial use. On the other hand, for\nlow-resource scenarios, the prevalent decode method, such as Conditional Random\nField (CRF), fails to exploit the full information of the training data. This\nwork proposes a fast and accurate CWS framework that incorporates a\nlight-weighted model and an upgraded decode method (PCRF) towards industrially\nlow-resource CWS scenarios. First, we distill a Transformer-based student model\nas an encoder, which not only accelerates the inference speed but also combines\nopen knowledge and domain-specific knowledge. Second, the perplexity score to\nevaluate the language model is fused into the CRF module to better identify the\nword boundaries. Experiments show that our work obtains relatively high\nperformance on multiple datasets with as low as 14\\% of time consumption\ncompared with the original BERT-based model. Moreover, under the low-resource\nsetting, we get superior results in comparison with the traditional decoding\nmethods.",

At every branch\nnode of a network Q, a Satnav (GPS) points to the arc leading to the\ndestination, or home node, H - but only with a high known probability p. Always\ntrusting the Satnav's suggestion may lead to an infinite cycle. If one wishes\nto reach H in least expected time, with what probability q=q(Q,p) should one\ntrust the pointer (if not, one chooses randomly among the other arcs)? We call\nthis the Faulty Satnav (GPS) Problem. We also consider versions where the trust\nprobability q can depend on the degree of the current node and a `treasure\nhunt' where two searchers try to reach H first. The agent searching for H need\nnot be a car, that is just a familiar example -- it could equally be a UAV\nreceiving unreliable GPS information. This problem has its origin not in driver\nfrustration but in the work of Fonio et al (2017) on ant navigation, where the\npointers correspond to pheromone markers pointing to the nest.

The\nclamping force in structural bolts is highly influenced by the bolt rotation.\nMuch of the existing vision-based research about bolt rotation estimation\nrelies on traditional computer vision algorithms such as Hough Transform to\nassess static images of bolts. This requires careful image preprocessing, and\nit may not perform well in the situation of complicated bolt assemblies, or in\nthe presence of surrounding objects and background noise, thus hindering their\nreal-world applications. In this study, an integrated real-time detect-track\nmethod, namely RTDT-Bolt, is proposed to monitor the bolt rotation angle.\nFirst, a real-time convolutional-neural-networks-based object detector, named\nYOLOv3-tiny, is established and trained to localize structural bolts. Then, the\ntarget-free object tracking algorithm based on optical flow is implemented, to\ncontinuously monitor and quantify the rotation of structural bolts. In order to\nenhance the tracking performance against background noise and potential\nillumination changes during tracking, the YOLOv3-tiny is integrated with the\noptical flow tracking algorithm to re-detect the bolts when the tracking gets\nlost. Extensive parameter studies were conducted to identify optimal tracking\nperformance and examine the potential limitations. The results indicate the\nRTDT-Bolt method can greatly enhance the tracking performance of bolt rotation,\nwhich can achieve over 90% accuracy using the recommended range for the\nparameters.",

In this paper we take a step further in order to provide the\npractitioner with tools to judge the trustworthiness of an explanation. To this\nend, we produce estimates of the uncertainty of a given explanation by\nmeasuring the ordinal consensus amongst a set of diverse bootstrapped surrogate\nexplainers.

    "abstract": "In order to allow machine learning algorithms to extract knowledge from raw\ndata, these data must first be cleaned, transformed, and put into\nmachine-appropriate form. These often very time-consuming phase is referred to\nas preprocessing. An important step in the preprocessing phase is feature\nselection, which aims at better performance of prediction models by reducing\nthe amount of features of a data set. Within these datasets, instances of\ndifferent events are often imbalanced, which means that certain normal events\nare over-represented while other rare events are very limited. Typically, these\nrare events are of special interest since they have more discriminative power\nthan normal events. The aim of this work was to filter instances provided to\nfeature selection methods for these rare instances, and thus positively\ninfluence the feature selection process. In the course of this work, we were\nable to show that this filtering has a positive effect on the performance of\nclassification models and that outlier detection methods are suitable for this\nfiltering. For some data sets, the resulting increase in performance was only a\nfew percent, but for other datasets, we were able to achieve increases in\nperformance of up to 16 percent. This work should lead to the improvement of\nthe predictive models and the better interpretability of feature selection in\nthe course of the preprocessing phase.

After showing the reliability of the\nmodel prediction, a comparison over almost $120$ cities in France is carried\nout between the two- and the one-dimensional approaches of the current building\nsimulation programs. Important discrepancies are observed for regions with high\nmagnitudes of solar radiation and wind velocity. Last, a sensitivity analysis\nis carried out using a derivative-based approach.

    "abstract": "Learning to synthesize data has emerged as a promising direction in zero-shot\nquantization (ZSQ), which represents neural networks by low-bit integer without\naccessing any of the real data. In this paper, we observe an interesting\nphenomenon of intra-class heterogeneity in real data and show that existing\nmethods fail to retain this property in their synthetic images, which causes a\nlimited performance increase. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nzero-shot quantization method referred to as IntraQ. First, we propose a local\nobject reinforcement that locates the target objects at different scales and\npositions of the synthetic images. Second, we introduce a marginal distance\nconstraint to form class-related features distributed in a coarse area. Lastly,\nwe devise a soft inception loss which injects a soft prior label to prevent the\nsynthetic images from being overfitting to a fixed object. Our IntraQ is\ndemonstrated to well retain the intra-class heterogeneity in the synthetic\nimages and also observed to perform state-of-the-art. For example, compared to\nthe advanced ZSQ, our IntraQ obtains 9.17\\% increase of the top-1 accuracy on\nImageNet when all layers of MobileNetV1 are quantized to 4-bit.

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the multi-agent decision problem where agents try to\ncoordinate to optimize a given system-level objective. While solving for the\nglobal optimal is intractable in many cases, the greedy algorithm is a\nwell-studied and efficient way to provide good approximate solutions - notably\nfor submodular optimization problems. Executing the greedy algorithm requires\nthe agents to be ordered and execute a local optimization based on the\nsolutions of the previous agents. However, in limited information settings,\npassing the solution from the previous agents may be nontrivial, as some agents\nmay not be able to directly communicate with each other. Thus the communication\ntime required to execute the greedy algorithm is closely tied to the order that\nthe agents are given. In this work, we characterize interplay between the\ncommunication complexity and agent orderings by showing that the complexity\nusing the best ordering is O(n) and increases considerably to O(n^2) when using\nthe worst ordering. Motivated by this, we also propose an algorithm that can\nfind an ordering and execute the greedy algorithm quickly, in a distributed\nfashion. We also show that such an execution of the greedy algorithm is\nadvantageous over current methods for distributed submodular maximization.",

    "abstract": "Within the framework of building energy assessment, this article proposes to\nuse a derivative based sensitivity analysis of heat transfer models in a\nbuilding envelope. Two, global and local, estimators are obtained at low\ncomputational cost, to evaluate the influence of the parameters on the model\noutputs. Ranking of these estimators values allows to reduce the number of\nmodel unknown parameters by excluding non-significant parameters. A comparison\nwith variance and regression-based methods is carried out and the results\nhighlight the satisfactory accuracy of the continuous-based approach. Moreover,\nfor the carried investigations the approach is $100$ times faster compared to\nthe variance-based methods. A case study applies the method to a real-world\nbuilding wall. The sensitivity of the thermal loads to local or global\nvariations of the wall thermal is investigated. Additionally, a case study of\nwall with window is analyzed.",

However, classifying these trajectories by\nmovement type is quite challenging as characteristics of motion trajectories\nobtained this way vary depending on camera calibrations. Although some existing\nmethods have addressed such classification tasks with decent accuracies, the\nperformance of these methods significantly relied on manual specification of\nseveral regions of interest. In this study, we proposed an automated\nclassification method for movement specific classification (such as right-turn,\nleft-turn and through movements) of vision-based vehicle trajectories. Our\nclassification framework identifies different movement patterns observed in a\ntraffic scene using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering technique\nThereafter a similarity-based assignment strategy is adopted to assign incoming\nvehicle trajectories to identified movement groups. A new similarity measure\nwas designed to overcome the inherent shortcomings of vision-based\ntrajectories. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the\nproposed classification approach and its ability to adapt to different traffic\nscenarios without any manual intervention.",

    "abstract": "Economic theory distinguishes between principal-agent settings in which the\nagent has a private type and settings in which the agent takes a hidden action.\nMany practical problems, however, involve aspects of both. For example, brand X\nmay seek to hire an influencer Y to create sponsored content to be posted on\nsocial media platform Z. This problem has a hidden action component (the brand\nmay not be able or willing to observe the amount of effort exerted by the\ninfluencer), but also a private type component (influencers may have different\ncosts per unit-of-effort).\nThis ``effort'' and ``cost per unit-of-effort'' perspective naturally leads\nto a principal-agent problem with hidden action and single-dimensional private\ntype, which generalizes both the classic principal-agent hidden action model of\ncontract theory \\`a la Grossmann and Hart [1986] and the (procurement version)\nof single-dimensional mechanism design \\`a la Myerson [1983]. A natural goal in\nthis model is to design an incentive-compatible contract, which consist of an\nallocation rule that maps types to actions, and a payment rule that maps types\nto payments for the stochastic outcomes of the chosen action.\nOur main contribution is a linear programming (LP) duality based\ncharacterization of implementable allocation rules for this model, which\napplies to both discrete and continuous types. This characterization shares\nimportant features of Myerson's celebrated characterization result, but also\ndeparts from it in significant ways. We present several applications, including\na polynomial-time algorithm for finding the optimal contract with a constant\nnumber of actions. This is in sharp contrast to recent work on hidden action\nproblems with multi-dimensional private information, which has shown that the\nproblem of computing an optimal contract for constant numbers of actions is\nAPX-hard.",

On the one hand, ASATs are based on best practices so there should be a\nnoticeable effect on software quality. On the other hand, ASATs suffer from\nfalse positive warnings, which developers have to inspect and then ignore or\nmark as invalid. In this article, we ask the question if ASATs have a\nmeasurable impact on external software quality, using the example of PMD for\nJava. We investigate the relationship between ASAT warnings emitted by PMD on\ndefects per change and per file. Our case study includes data for the history\nof each file as well as the differences between changed files and the project\nin which they are contained. We investigate whether files that induce a defect\nhave more static analysis warnings than the rest of the project. Moreover, we\ninvestigate the impact of two different sets of ASAT rules. We find that, bug\ninducing files contain less static analysis warnings than other files of the\nproject at that point in time. However, this can be explained by the overall\ndecreasing warning density. When compared with all other changes, we find a\nstatistically significant difference in one metric for all rules and two\nmetrics for a subset of rules. However, the effect size is negligible in all\ncases, showing that the actual difference in warning density between bug\ninducing changes and other changes is small at best.",

Specifically, we consider two agents that\nrepeatedly play a multi-objective normal-form game. In such games, the payoffs\nresulting from joint actions are vector valued. Taking a utility-based\napproach, we assume a utility function exists that maps vectors to scalar\nutilities and consider agents that aim to maximise the utility of expected\npayoff vectors. As agents do not necessarily know their opponent's utility\nfunction or strategy, they must learn optimal policies to interact with each\nother. To aid agents in arriving at adequate solutions, we introduce four novel\npreference communication protocols for both cooperative as well as\nself-interested communication. Each approach describes a specific protocol for\none agent communicating preferences over their actions and how another agent\nresponds. These protocols are subsequently evaluated on a set of five benchmark\ngames against baseline agents that do not communicate. We find that preference\ncommunication can drastically alter the learning process and lead to the\nemergence of cyclic Nash equilibria which had not been previously observed in\nthis setting. Additionally, we introduce a communication scheme where agents\nmust learn when to communicate. For agents in games with Nash equilibria, we\nfind that communication can be beneficial but difficult to learn when agents\nhave different preferred equilibria. When this is not the case, agents become\nindifferent to communication. In games without Nash equilibria, our results\nshow differences across learning rates. When using faster learners, we observe\nthat explicit communication becomes more prevalent at around 50% of the time,\nas it helps them in learning a compromise joint policy.

In this case, only compressed data needs\nto be transferred, as decoding will be handled by the accelerators. In order to\ndesign such a GPU-based decoder, the respective algorithms must be parallelized\non a fine-grained level. However, parallel decoding of individual JPEG files\nrepresents a complex task. In this paper, we present an efficient method for\nJPEG image decompression on GPUs, which implements an important subset of the\nJPEG standard. The proposed algorithm evaluates codeword locations at arbitrary\npositions in the bitstream, thereby enabling parallel decompression of\nindependent chunks. Our performance evaluation shows that on an A100 (V100) GPU\nour implementation can outperform the state-of-the-art implementations\nlibjpeg-turbo (CPU) and nvJPEG (GPU) by a factor of up to 51 (34) and 8.0\n(5.7). Furthermore, it achieves a speedup of up to 3.4 over nvJPEG accelerated\nwith the dedicated hardware JPEG decoder on an A100.",

    "abstract": "Post-Moore's law area-constrained systems rely on accelerators to deliver\nperformance enhancements. Coarse grained accelerators can offer substantial\ndomain acceleration, but manual, ad-hoc identification of code to accelerate is\nprohibitively expensive. Because cycle-accurate simulators and high-level\nsynthesis flows are so time-consuming, manual creation of high-utilization\naccelerators that exploit control and data flow patterns at optimal\ngranularities is rarely successful. To address these challenges, we present\nAccelMerger, the first automated methodology to create coarse grained, control-\nand data-flow-rich, merged accelerators. AccelMerger uses sequence alignment\nmatching to recognize similar function call-graphs and loops, and neural\nnetworks to quickly evaluate their post-HLS characteristics. It accurately\nidentifies which functions to accelerate, and it merges accelerators to respect\nan area budget and to accommodate system communication characteristics like\nlatency and bandwidth. Merging two accelerators can save as much as 99% of the\narea of one. The space saved is used by a globally optimal integer linear\nprogram to allocate more accelerators for increased performance. We demonstate\nAccelMerger's effectiveness using HLS flows without any manual effort to\nfine-tune the resulting designs. On FPGA-based systems, AccelMerger yields\napplication performance improvements of up to 16.7x over software\nimplementations, and 1.91x on average with respect to state-of-the-art\nearly-stage design space exploration tools.",

    "abstract": "The Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy of semidefinite programs is a powerful\nalgorithmic paradigm which captures state-of-the-art algorithmic guarantees for\na wide array of problems. In the average case setting, SoS lower bounds provide\nstrong evidence of algorithmic hardness or information-computation gaps. Prior\nto this work, SoS lower bounds have been obtained for problems in the \"dense\"\ninput regime, where the input is a collection of independent Rademacher or\nGaussian random variables, while the sparse regime has remained out of reach.\nWe make the first progress in this direction by obtaining strong SoS lower\nbounds for the problem of Independent Set on sparse random graphs. We prove\nthat with high probability over an Erdos-Renyi random graph $G\\sim\nG_{n,\\frac{d}{n}}$ with average degree $d>\\log^2 n$, degree-$D_{SoS}$ SoS fails\nto refute the existence of an independent set of size $k =\n\\Omega\\left(\\frac{n}{\\sqrt{d}(\\log n)(D_{SoS})^{c_0}} \\right)$ in $G$ (where\n$c_0$ is an absolute constant), whereas the true size of the largest\nindependent set in $G$ is $O\\left(\\frac{n\\log d}{d}\\right)$.\nOur proof involves several significant extensions of the techniques used for\nproving SoS lower bounds in the dense setting. Previous lower bounds are based\non the pseudo-calibration heuristic of Barak et al [FOCS 2016] which produces a\ncandidate SoS solution using a planted distribution indistinguishable from the\ninput distribution via low-degree tests. In the sparse case the natural planted\ndistribution does admit low-degree distinguishers, and we show how to adapt the\npseudo-calibration heuristic to overcome this.\nAnother notorious technical challenge for the sparse regime is the quest for\nmatrix norm bounds. In this paper, we obtain new norm bounds for graph matrices\nin the sparse setting.",

In this problem, each\nrequest $i$ arrives at some point $v_i$ of an $n$-point metric space at time\n$b_i$ and comes with a deadline $e_i$. One of the $k$ servers must be moved to\n$v_i$ at some time in the interval $[b_i, e_i]$ to satisfy this request. We\ngive an online algorithm for this problem with a competitive ratio of ${\\rm\npolylog} (n,\\Delta)$, where $\\Delta$ is the aspect ratio of the metric space.\nPrior to our work, the best competitive ratio known for this problem was $O(k\n\\cdot {\\rm polylog}(n))$ given by Azar et al.

This\nLP naturally corresponds to the min-cost flow formulation of $k$-server, and\neasily extends to the case of time-windows. We give an online algorithm for\nobtaining a feasible fractional solution for this LP, and a primal dual\nanalysis framework for accounting the cost of the solution. Together, they\nyield a new $k$-server algorithm with poly-logarithmic competitive ratio, and\nextend to the time-windows case as well.

DiverGAN adopts two novel\nword-level attention modules, i.e., a channel-attention module (CAM) and a\npixel-attention module (PAM), which model the importance of each word in the\ngiven sentence while allowing the network to assign larger weights to the\nsignificant channels and pixels semantically aligning with the salient words.\nAfter that, Conditional Adaptive Instance-Layer Normalization (CAdaILN) is\nintroduced to enable the linguistic cues from the sentence embedding to\nflexibly manipulate the amount of change in shape and texture, further\nimproving visual-semantic representation and helping stabilize the training.\nAlso, a dual-residual structure is developed to preserve more original visual\nfeatures while allowing for deeper networks, resulting in faster convergence\nspeed and more vivid details. Furthermore, we propose to plug a fully-connected\nlayer into the pipeline to address the lack-of-diversity problem, since we\nobserve that a dense layer will remarkably enhance the generative capability of\nthe network, balancing the trade-off between a low-dimensional random latent\ncode contributing to variants and modulation modules that use high-dimensional\nand textual contexts to strength feature maps.

    "abstract": "Schemata are structured representations of complex tasks that can aid\nartificial intelligence by allowing models to break down complex tasks into\nintermediate steps. We propose a novel system that induces schemata from web\nvideos and generalizes them to capture unseen tasks with the goal of improving\nvideo retrieval performance. Our system proceeds in three major phases: (1)\nGiven a task with related videos, we construct an initial schema for a task\nusing a joint video-text model to match video segments with text representing\nsteps from wikiHow; (2) We generalize schemata to unseen tasks by leveraging\nlanguage models to edit the text within existing schemata. Through\ngeneralization, we can allow our schemata to cover a more extensive range of\ntasks with a small amount of learning data; (3) We conduct zero-shot\ninstructional video retrieval with the unseen task names as the queries. Our\nschema-guided approach outperforms existing methods for video retrieval, and we\ndemonstrate that the schemata induced by our system are better than those\ngenerated by other models.",

    "abstract": "Randomized smoothing is currently a state-of-the-art method to construct a\ncertifiably robust classifier from neural networks against $\\ell_2$-adversarial\nperturbations. Under the paradigm, the robustness of a classifier is aligned\nwith the prediction confidence, i.e., the higher confidence from a smoothed\nclassifier implies the better robustness. This motivates us to rethink the\nfundamental trade-off between accuracy and robustness in terms of calibrating\nconfidences of a smoothed classifier. In this paper, we propose a simple\ntraining scheme, coined SmoothMix, to control the robustness of smoothed\nclassifiers via self-mixup: it trains on convex combinations of samples along\nthe direction of adversarial perturbation for each input. The proposed\nprocedure effectively identifies over-confident, near off-class samples as a\ncause of limited robustness in case of smoothed classifiers, and offers an\nintuitive way to adaptively set a new decision boundary between these samples\nfor better robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod can significantly improve the certified $\\ell_2$-robustness of smoothed\nclassifiers compared to existing state-of-the-art robust training methods.",

However, realizing efficient,\ndelay-bounded, and reliable communications for a massive number of user\nequipments (UEs) in mURLLC, is extremely challenging as it needs to\nsimultaneously take into account the latency, reliability, and massive access\nrequirements. To support these requirements, the third generation partnership\nproject (3GPP) has introduced enhanced grant-free (GF) transmission in the\nuplink (UL), with multiple active configured-grants (CGs) for URLLC UEs. With\nmultiple CGs (MCG) for UL, UE can choose any of these grants as soon as the\ndata arrives. In addition, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been\nproposed to synergize with GF transmission to mitigate the serious transmission\ndelay and network congestion problems. In this paper, we develop a novel\nlearning framework for MCG-GF-NOMA systems with bursty traffic. We first design\nthe MCG-GF-NOMA model by characterizing each CG using the parameters: the\nnumber of contention-transmission units (CTUs), the starting slot of each CG\nwithin a subframe, and the number of repetitions of each CG. Based on the\nmodel, the latency and reliability performances are characterized. We then\nformulate the MCG-GF-NOMA resources configuration problem taking into account\nthree constraints. Finally, we propose a Cooperative Multi-Agent based Double\nDeep Q-Network (CMA-DDQN) algorithm to allocate the channel resources among\nMCGs so as to maximize the number of successful transmissions under the latency\nconstraint. Our results show that the MCG-GF-NOMA framework can simultaneously\nimprove the low latency and high reliability performances in massive URLLC.",

We propose SeCGAN, a novel label-guided cGAN for\nediting face images utilising semantic information without the need to specify\ntarget semantic masks. During training, SeCGAN has two branches of generators\nand discriminators operating in parallel, with one trained to translate RGB\nimages and the other for semantic masks.

In the absence of an analytic solution, most\nquantum optimal control methods rely on an iterative scheme to update the\nsolution estimate.

This paper develops a new general purpose solver for quantum\noptimal control based on the PRojection Operator Newton method for Trajectory\nOptimization, or PRONTO.

At each\niteration, the descent direction is obtained by computing the analytic solution\nto a Linear-Quadratic trajectory optimization problem. The resulting method\nguarantees monotonic convergence at every iteration and quadratic convergence\nin proximity of the solution.

The formulation of the lemma involves a\ngraph with one vertex per event, with edges indicating potential negative\ndependence. The word \"Local\" in LLL reflects that the condition for the\nnegative correlation can be expressed solely in terms of the neighborhood of\neach vertex. In contrast to this local view, Shearer developed an exact\ncriterion for the avoidance probability to be strictly positive, but it\ninvolves summing over all independent sets of the graph.\nIn this work we make two contributions. The first is to develop a hierarchy\nof increasingly powerful, increasingly non-local lemmata for bounding the\navoidance probability from below, each lemma associated with a different set of\nwalks in the graph. Already, at its second level, our hierarchy is stronger\nthan all known local lemmata. To demonstrate its power we prove new bounds for\nthe negative-fugacity singularity of the hard-core model on several lattices, a\ncentral problem in statistical physics.\nOur second contribution is to prove that Shearer's connection between the\nprobabilistic setting and the independent set polynomial holds for\n\\emph{arbitrary supermodular} functions, not just probability measures. This\nmeans that all LLL machinery can be employed to bound from below an arbitrary\nsupermodular function, based only on information regarding its value at\nsingleton sets and partial information regarding their interactions. We show\nthat this readily implies both the quantum LLL of Ambainis, Kempe, and\nSattath~[JACM 2012], and the quantum Shearer criterion of Sattath, Morampudi,\nLaumann, and Moessner~[PNAS 2016].",

In this paper, we focus on the continuous\ntreatment setting and propose a jump interval-learning to develop an\nindividualized interval-valued decision rule (I2DR) that maximizes the expected\noutcome. Unlike IDRs that recommend a single treatment, the proposed I2DR\nyields an interval of treatment options for each individual, making it more\nflexible to implement in practice. To derive an optimal I2DR, our jump\ninterval-learning method estimates the conditional mean of the outcome given\nthe treatment and the covariates via jump penalized regression, and derives the\ncorresponding optimal I2DR based on the estimated outcome regression function.\nThe regressor is allowed to be either linear for clear interpretation or deep\nneural network to model complex treatment-covariates interactions. To implement\njump interval-learning, we develop a searching algorithm based on dynamic\nprogramming that efficiently computes the outcome regression function.\nStatistical properties of the resulting I2DR are established when the outcome\nregression function is either a piecewise or continuous function over the\ntreatment space.

    "abstract": "The common approach to compositional data analysis is to transform the data\nby means of logratios. Logratios between pairs of compositional parts (pairwise\nlogratios) are the easiest to interpret in many research problems. When the\nnumber of parts is large, some form of logratio selection is a must, for\ninstance by means of an unsupervised learning method based on a stepwise\nselection of the pairwise logratios that explain the largest percentage of the\nlogratio variance in the compositional dataset. In this article we present\nthree alternative stepwise supervised learning methods to select the pairwise\nlogratios that best explain a dependent variable in a generalized linear model,\neach geared for a specific problem. The first method features unrestricted\nsearch, where any pairwise logratio can be selected. This method has a complex\ninterpretation if some pairs of parts in the logratios overlap, but it leads to\nthe most accurate predictions. The second method restricts parts to occur only\nonce, which makes the corresponding logratios intuitively interpretable. The\nthird method uses additive logratios, so that $K-1$ selected logratios involve\nexactly $K$ parts. This method in fact searches for the subcomposition with the\nhighest explanatory power. Once the subcomposition is identified, the\nresearcher's favourite logratio representation may be used in subsequent\nanalyses, not only pairwise logratios. Our methodology allows logratios or\nnon-compositional covariates to be forced into the models based on theoretical\nknowledge, and various stopping criteria are available based on information\nmeasures or statistical significance with the Bonferroni correction.

In doing so, we\ninvestigate the reconstruction quality using tetromino pixels for the first\ntime in literature. Instead of using different types of tetrominoes as proposed\nin the literature for a sensor layout, we show that using a small repeating\ncell consisting of only four T-tetrominoes is sufficient. For reconstruction,\nwe use a locally fully connected reconstruction (LFCR) network as well as two\nclassical reconstruction methods from the field of compressed sensing. Using\nthe LFCR network in combination with the proposed tetromino layout, we achieve\nsuperior image quality in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and visually compared to\nconventional single-image super-resolution using the very deep super-resolution\n(VDSR) network. For the PSNR, a gain of up to +1.92 dB is achieved.",

    "abstract": "United Nation (UN) security council has fifteen members, out of which five\npermanent members of the council can use their veto power against any\nunfavorable decision taken by the council. In certain situation, a member using\nright to veto may prefer to remain anonymous. This need leads to the\nrequirement of the protocols for anonymous veto which can be viewed as a\nspecial type of voting. Recently, a few protocols for quantum anonymous veto\nhave been designed which clearly show quantum advantages in ensuring anonymity\nof the veto. However, none of the efficient protocols for quantum anonymous\nveto have yet been experimentally realized. Here, we implement 2 of those\nprotocols for quantum anonymous veto using an IBM quantum computer named IBMQ\nCasablanca and different quantum resources like Bell, GHZ and cluster states.\nIn this set of proof-of-principle experiments, it's observed that using the\npresent technology, a protocol for quantum anonymous veto can be realized\nexperimentally if the number of people who can veto remains small as in the\ncase of UN council. Further, it's observed that Bell state based protocol\nimplemented here performs better than the GHZ/cluster state based\nimplementation of the other protocol in an ideal scenario as well as in\npresence of different types of noise (amplitude damping, phase damping,\ndepolarizing and bit-flip noise). In addition, it's observed that based on\ndiminishing impact on fidelity, different noise models studied here can be\nordered in ascending order as phase damping, amplitude damping, depolarizing,\nbit-flip.",

We propose sampling to adjust for this imbalance\nwith the goal of improving the performance of models trained on historical\nproduction data. We investigate the use of three sampling approaches to adjust\nfor imbalance. The goal is to downsample the covariates in the training data\nand subsequently fit a regression model. We investigate how the predictive\npower of the model changes when using either the sampled or the original data\nfor training. We apply our methods on a large biopharmaceutical manufacturing\ndata set from an advanced simulation of penicillin production and find that\nfitting a model using the sampled data gives a small reduction in the overall\npredictive performance, but yields a systematically better performance on\nunderrepresented observations.

    "abstract": "The Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) is a recent technique that\ngives a unified framework to describe most quantum algorithms discovered so\nfar, and may lead to the development of novel quantum algorithms. In this paper\nwe investigate the hardness of classically simulating the QSVT. A recent result\nby Chia, Gily\\'en, Li, Lin, Tang and Wang (STOC 2020) showed that the QSVT can\nbe efficiently \"dequantized\" for low-rank matrices, and discussed its\nimplication to quantum machine learning. In this work, motivated by\nestablishing the superiority of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry and\nmaking progress on the quantum PCP conjecture, we focus on the other main class\nof matrices considered in applications of the QSVT, sparse matrices.\nWe first show how to efficiently \"dequantize\", with arbitrarily small\nconstant precision, the QSVT associated with a low-degree polynomial. We apply\nthis technique to design classical algorithms that estimate, with constant\nprecision, the singular values of a sparse matrix. We show in particular that a\ncentral computational problem considered by quantum algorithms for quantum\nchemistry (estimating the ground state energy of a local Hamiltonian when\ngiven, as an additional input, a state sufficiently close to the ground state)\ncan be solved efficiently with constant precision on a classical computer. As a\ncomplementary result, we prove that with inverse-polynomial precision, the same\nproblem becomes BQP-complete. This gives theoretical evidence for the\nsuperiority of quantum algorithms for chemistry, and strongly suggests that\nsaid superiority stems from the improved precision achievable in the quantum\nsetting. We also discuss how this dequantization technique may help make\nprogress on the central quantum PCP conjecture.",

However, the deep learning method requires much data\nto guarantee the generalization ability and the data of fluid dynamics are\ndeficient. Recently, physics informed neural network (PINN) is popular to solve\nthe fluid flow problems, which basic concept is to embed the governing equation\nand continuity equation into loss function, with the requirement of less\ndataset for obtaining a reliable neural network. In this paper, the\nmixed-variable PINN method, which convert the governing equation into continuum\nand constitutive formulations, is proposed to solve the fluid dynamics (flow\npast cylinder) without any labeled data. The initial/boundary conditions with\npenalty factors are also embedded into the loss function to become a\nwell-imposed problem. The results show that mixed-variable PINN has better\npredictive ability to construct the flow field than traditional PINN scheme.\nFurthermore, the transfer learning method is adopted to is solve the fluid\nsolutions with different Reynold numbers with less computational cost.

With the development of biology and medical\nengineering, there is a high demand for real-time and robust SIM imaging under\nextreme low light and short exposure environments.

In this paper, we propose a single-frame structured\nillumination microscopy (SF-SIM) based on deep learning. Our SF-SIM only needs\none shot of a structured illumination frame and generates similar results\ncompared with the traditional SIM systems that typically require 15 shots. In\nour SF-SIM, we propose a noise estimator which can effectively suppress the\nnoise in the image and enable our method to work under the low light and short\nexposure environment, without the need for stacking multiple frames for\nnon-local denoising. We also design a bandpass attention module that makes our\ndeep network more sensitive to the change of frequency and enhances the imaging\nquality.

This compels transportation authorities to provide better\nand more reliable modes of public transit through improved technologies and\nincreased service quality. These improvements can be achieved by identifying\nand understanding the factors that influence urban public transit demand.\nCommon factors that can influence urban public transit demand can be internal\nand/or external factors. Internal factors include policy measures such as\ntransit fares, service headways, and travel times. External factors can include\ngeographic, socioeconomic, and highway facility characteristics. There is\ninherent simultaneity between transit supply and demand, thus a two-stage least\nsquares (2SLS) regression modeling procedure should be conducted to forecast\nurban transit supply and demand. As such, two multiple linear regression models\nshould be developed: one to predict transit supply and a second to predict\ntransit demand. It was found that service area density, total average cost per\ntrip, and the average number of vehicles operated in maximum service can be\nused to forecast transit supply, expressed as vehicle revenue hours.\nFurthermore, estimated vehicle revenue hours and total average fares per trip\ncan be used to forecast transit demand, expressed as unlinked passenger trips.\nAdditional data such as socioeconomic information of the surrounding areas for\neach transit agency and travel time information of the various transit systems\nwould be useful to improve upon the models developed.",

However, there do not currently\nexist valid tests for whether the underlying density of given data is\nlog-concave. The recent universal likelihood ratio test provides a valid test.\nThe universal test relies on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and efficient\nmethods already exist for finding the log-concave MLE. This yields the first\ntest of log-concavity that is provably valid in finite samples in any\ndimension, for which we also establish asymptotic consistency results.\nEmpirically, we find that the highest power is obtained by using random\nprojections to convert the d-dimensional testing problem into many\none-dimensional problems, leading to a simple procedure that is statistically\nand computationally efficient.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in most countries of the world. Since\nprompt diagnosis of tumors can allow oncologists to discern their nature, type\nand the mode of treatment, tumor detection and segmentation from CT Scan images\nis a crucial field of study worldwide. This paper approaches lung tumor\nsegmentation by applying two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (DWT) on\nthe LOTUS dataset for more meticulous texture analysis whilst integrating\ninformation from neighboring CT slices before feeding them to a Deeply\nSupervised MultiResUNet model. Variations in learning rates, decay and\noptimization algorithms while training the network have led to different dice\nco-efficients, the detailed statistics of which have been included in this\npaper. We also discuss the challenges in this dataset and how we opted to\novercome them. In essence, this study aims to maximize the success rate of\npredicting tumor regions from two dimensional CT Scan slices by experimenting\nwith a number of adequate networks, resulting in a dice co-efficient of 0.8472.",

    "abstract": "The classical machine-learning model for support vector regression (SVR) is\nwidely used for regression tasks, including weather prediction, stock-market\nand real-estate pricing. However, a practically realisable quantum version for\nSVR remains to be formulated. We devise annealing-based algorithms, namely\nsimulated and quantum-classical hybrid, for training two SVR models, and\ncompare their empirical performances against the SVR implementation of Python's\nscikit-learn package and the SVR-based state-of-the-art algorithm for the\nfacial landmark detection (FLD) problem. Our method is to derive a\nquadratic-unconstrained-binary formulation for the optimisation problem used\nfor training a SVR model and solve this problem using annealing. Using D-Wave's\nHybrid Solver, we construct a quantum-assisted SVR model, thereby demonstrating\na slight advantage over classical models regarding landmark-detection accuracy.\nFurthermore, we observe that annealing-based SVR models predict landmarks with\nlower variances compared to the SVR models trained by greedy optimisation\nprocedures. Our work is a proof-of-concept example for applying quantu-assisted\nSVR to a supervised learning task with a small training dataset.",

In this note we use the polynomial method to give a proof with\na degree bound of $md(|\\mathbb{F}|-1)$.
