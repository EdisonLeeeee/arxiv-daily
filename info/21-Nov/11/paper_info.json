    "abstract": "We present CrissCross, a self-supervised framework for learning audio-visual\nrepresentations. A novel notion is introduced in our framework whereby in\naddition to learning the intra-modal and standard 'synchronous' cross-modal\nrelations, CrissCross also learns 'asynchronous' cross-modal relationships. We\nshow that by relaxing the temporal synchronicity between the audio and visual\nmodalities, the network learns strong time-invariant representations. Our\nexperiments show that strong augmentations for both audio and visual modalities\nwith relaxation of cross-modal temporal synchronicity optimize performance. To\npretrain our proposed framework, we use 3 different datasets with varying\nsizes, Kinetics-Sound, Kinetics-400, and AudioSet. The learned representations\nare evaluated on a number of downstream tasks namely action recognition, sound\nclassification, and retrieval. CrissCross shows state-of-the-art performances\non action recognition (UCF101 and HMDB51) and sound classification (ESC50). The\ncodes and pretrained models will be made publicly available.",

Traditionally, computer vision methods were employed for HAR,\nwhich has numerous problems such as secrecy or privacy, the influence of\nenvironmental factors, less mobility, higher running costs, occlusion, and so\non. A new trend in the use of sensors, especially inertial sensors, has lately\nemerged. There are several advantages of employing sensor data as an\nalternative to traditional computer vision algorithms. Many of the limitations\nof computer vision algorithms have been documented in the literature, including\nresearch on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches for\nactivity categorization utilizing sensor data.

In this paper, we provide statistical perspectives on the\nreliability of AI systems. Different from other considerations, the reliability\nof AI systems focuses on the time dimension.

We introduce a so-called\nSMART statistical framework for AI reliability research, which includes five\ncomponents: Structure of the system, Metrics of reliability, Analysis of\nfailure causes, Reliability assessment, and Test planning. We review\ntraditional methods in reliability data analysis and software reliability, and\ndiscuss how those existing methods can be transformed for reliability modeling\nand assessment of AI systems. We also describe recent developments in modeling\nand analysis of AI reliability and outline statistical research challenges in\nthis area, including out-of-distribution detection, the effect of the training\nset, adversarial attacks, model accuracy, and uncertainty quantification, and\ndiscuss how those topics can be related to AI reliability, with illustrative\nexamples.

    "abstract": "Document-level relation extraction aims to identify relations between\nentities in a whole document. Prior efforts to capture long-range dependencies\nhave relied heavily on implicitly powerful representations learned through\n(graph) neural networks, which makes the model less transparent. To tackle this\nchallenge, in this paper, we propose LogiRE, a novel probabilistic model for\ndocument-level relation extraction by learning logic rules. LogiRE treats logic\nrules as latent variables and consists of two modules: a rule generator and a\nrelation extractor. The rule generator is to generate logic rules potentially\ncontributing to final predictions, and the relation extractor outputs final\npredictions based on the generated logic rules. Those two modules can be\nefficiently optimized with the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By\nintroducing logic rules into neural networks, LogiRE can explicitly capture\nlong-range dependencies as well as enjoy better interpretation. Empirical\nresults show that LogiRE significantly outperforms several strong baselines in\nterms of relation performance (1.8 F1 score) and logical consistency (over 3.3\nlogic score).

One such example is the view from\ncameras installed below VR headsets. To achieve this task, we first make use of\nconditional GANs to translate the egocentric views to full body third-person\nviews. This increases the comprehensibility of the image and caters to\nocclusions. The generated third-person view is further sent through the 3D\nreconstruction module that generates a 3D mesh of the body. We also train a\nnetwork that can take the third person full-body view of the subject and\ngenerate the texture maps for applying on the mesh. The generated mesh has\nfairly realistic body proportions and is fully rigged allowing for further\napplications such as real-time animation and pose transfer in games.

In this paper, we go beyond mere descriptions of the learning\ndynamics by taking a graph perspective and investigating the relationship\nbetween the graph structure of NNs and their performance. Specifically, we\npropose (1) representing the neural network learning process as a time-evolving\ngraph (i.e., a series of static graph snapshots over epochs), (2) capturing the\nstructural changes of the NN during the training phase in a simple temporal\nsummary, and (3) leveraging the structural summary to predict the accuracy of\nthe underlying NN in a classification or regression task. For the dynamic graph\nrepresentation of NNs, we explore structural representations for\nfully-connected and convolutional layers, which are key components of powerful\nNN models. Our analysis shows that a simple summary of graph statistics, such\nas weighted degree and eigenvector centrality, over just a few epochs can be\nused to accurately predict the performance of NNs. For example, a weighted\ndegree-based summary of the time-evolving graph that is constructed based on 5\ntraining epochs of the LeNet architecture achieves classification accuracy of\nover 93%.

    "abstract": "Real-time data collection and analysis in large experimental facilities\npresent a great challenge across multiple domains, including high energy\nphysics, nuclear physics, and cosmology. To address this, machine learning\n(ML)-based methods for real-time data compression have drawn significant\nattention. However, unlike natural image data, such as CIFAR and ImageNet that\nare relatively small-sized and continuous, scientific data often come in as\nthree-dimensional data volumes at high rates with high sparsity (many zeros)\nand non-Gaussian value distribution. This makes direct application of popular\nML compression methods, as well as conventional data compression methods,\nsuboptimal. To address these obstacles, this work introduces a dual-head\nautoencoder to resolve sparsity and regression simultaneously, called\n\\textit{Bicephalous Convolutional AutoEncoder} (BCAE). This method shows\nadvantages both in compression fidelity and ratio compared to traditional data\ncompression methods, such as MGARD, SZ, and ZFP. To achieve similar fidelity,\nthe best performer among the traditional methods can reach only half the\ncompression ratio of BCAE. Moreover, a thorough ablation study of the BCAE\nmethod shows that a dedicated segmentation decoder improves the reconstruction.",

Next, by relating\nthe maximum rooted latency problem to minimizing the maximum broadcast-time, we\nderive new approximation algorithms for this version. For the average rooted\nlatency objective, such an approach introduces a necessary logarithmic factor\noverhead. We overcome this and give a constant-factor approximation for trees\nby devising near-optimal schedules that are locally periodic at each node and\nwhere each node has the same offset value in hearing fresh information from its\nparent.

Nonetheless, surprisingly, we find these\nconclusions are drawn from unfair experimental settings, where Transformers and\nCNNs are compared at different scales and are applied with distinct training\nframeworks. In this paper, we aim to provide the first fair & in-depth\ncomparisons between Transformers and CNNs, focusing on robustness evaluations.\nWith our unified training setup, we first challenge the previous belief that\nTransformers outshine CNNs when measuring adversarial robustness. More\nsurprisingly, we find CNNs can easily be as robust as Transformers on defending\nagainst adversarial attacks, if they properly adopt Transformers' training\nrecipes. While regarding generalization on out-of-distribution samples, we show\npre-training on (external) large-scale datasets is not a fundamental request\nfor enabling Transformers to achieve better performance than CNNs. Moreover,\nour ablations suggest such stronger generalization is largely benefited by the\nTransformer's self-attention-like architectures per se, rather than by other\ntraining setups. We hope this work can help the community better understand and\nbenchmark the robustness of Transformers and CNNs.

OPlaceRAN supports the dynamic placement of radio\nfunctions focusing on vNG-RAN planning and is designed to be agnostic to the\nplacement optimization model. To validate OPlaceRAN, we developed a prototype\nbased on up-to-date cloud-native tools to deploy RAN using containerized\nvirtualization using the OpenAirInterface emulator and considering two distinct\nfunctional splits (options 2 and 6). The evaluation is tested as\nproofs-of-concept in a real computing infrastructure using two different\nplacement solutions. Our results reveal that OPlaceRAN is an effective\ncloud-native solution for containerized network functions placement and\nagnostic to the optimization model. Additionally, OPlaceRAN is up-to-date with\nthe most advanced vNG-RAN design and development approaches, contributing to\nthe evolution of the fifth-generation of mobile networks.",

    "abstract": "There are many challenging problems in the person re-identification (ReID)\ntask, such as the occlusion and scale variation. Existing works usually tried\nto solve them by employing a one-branch network. This one-branch network needs\nto be robust to various challenging problems, which makes this network\noverburdened. This paper proposes to divide-and-conquer the ReID task. For this\npurpose, we employ several self-supervision operations to simulate different\nchallenging problems and handle each challenging problem using different\nnetworks. Concretely, we use the random erasing operation and propose a novel\nrandom scaling operation to generate new images with controllable\ncharacteristics. A general multi-branch network, including one master branch\nand two servant branches, is introduced to handle different scenes. These\nbranches learn collaboratively and achieve different perceptive abilities. In\nthis way, the complex scenes in the ReID task are effectively disentangled, and\nthe burden of each branch is relieved. The results from extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on\nthree ReID benchmarks and two occluded ReID benchmarks. Ablation study also\nshows that the proposed scheme and operations significantly improve the\nperformance in various scenes.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in hierarchical reinforcement learning, its applications to\npath planning in autonomous driving on highways are challenging. One reason is\nthat conventional hierarchical reinforcement learning approaches are not\namenable to autonomous driving due to its riskiness: the agent must move\navoiding multiple obstacles such as other agents that are highly unpredictable,\nthus safe regions are small, scattered, and changeable over time. To overcome\nthis challenge, we propose a spatially hierarchical reinforcement learning\nmethod for state space and policy space. The high-level policy selects not only\nbehavioral sub-policy but also regions to pay mind to in state space and for\noutline in policy space. Subsequently, the low-level policy elaborates the\nshort-term goal position of the agent within the outline of the region selected\nby the high-level command. The network structure and optimization suggested in\nour method are as concise as those of single-level methods. Experiments on the\nenvironment with various shapes of roads showed that our method finds the\nnearly optimal policies from early episodes, outperforming a baseline\nhierarchical reinforcement learning method, especially in narrow and complex\nroads. The resulting trajectories on the roads were similar to those of human\nstrategies on the behavioral planning level.",

Thus similar to standard bandit learning, a basic learning question in\nmulti-agent systems is whether agents can learn to efficiently eliminate all\ndominated actions in an unknown game if they can only observe noisy bandit\nfeedback about the payoff of their played actions. Surprisingly, despite a\nseemingly simple task, we show a quite negative result; that is, standard no\nregret algorithms -- including the entire family of Dual Averaging algorithms\n-- provably take exponentially many rounds to eliminate all dominated actions.\nMoreover, algorithms with the stronger no swap regret also suffer similar\nexponential inefficiency. To overcome these barriers, we develop a new\nalgorithm that adjusts Exp3 with Diminishing Historical rewards (termed\nExp3-DH); Exp3-DH gradually forgets history at carefully tailored rates. We\nprove that when all agents run Exp3-DH (a.k.a., self-play in multi-agent\nlearning), all dominated actions can be iteratively eliminated within\npolynomially many rounds. Our experimental results further demonstrate the\nefficiency of Exp3-DH, and that state-of-the-art bandit algorithms, even those\ndeveloped specifically for learning in games, fail to eliminate all dominated\nactions efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Models recently used in the literature proving residual networks (ResNets)\nare better than linear predictors are actually different from standard ResNets\nthat have been widely used in computer vision. In addition to the assumptions\nsuch as scalar-valued output or single residual block, these models have no\nnonlinearities at the final residual representation that feeds into the final\naffine layer. To codify such a difference in nonlinearities and reveal a linear\nestimation property, we define ResNEsts, i.e., Residual Nonlinear Estimators,\nby simply dropping nonlinearities at the last residual representation from\nstandard ResNets. We show that wide ResNEsts with bottleneck blocks can always\nguarantee a very desirable training property that standard ResNets aim to\nachieve, i.e., adding more blocks does not decrease performance given the same\nset of basis elements. To prove that, we first recognize ResNEsts are basis\nfunction models that are limited by a coupling problem in basis learning and\nlinear prediction. Then, to decouple prediction weights from basis learning, we\nconstruct a special architecture termed augmented ResNEst (A-ResNEst) that\nalways guarantees no worse performance with the addition of a block. As a\nresult, such an A-ResNEst establishes empirical risk lower bounds for a ResNEst\nusing corresponding bases. Our results demonstrate ResNEsts indeed have a\nproblem of diminishing feature reuse; however, it can be avoided by\nsufficiently expanding or widening the input space, leading to the\nabove-mentioned desirable property. Inspired by the DenseNets that have been\nshown to outperform ResNets, we also propose a corresponding new model called\nDensely connected Nonlinear Estimator (DenseNEst). We show that any DenseNEst\ncan be represented as a wide ResNEst with bottleneck blocks. Unlike ResNEsts,\nDenseNEsts exhibit the desirable property without any special architectural\nre-design.",

We\npropose the DiScovering Latent Relation (DSLR) model, which is flexibly\napplicable even if the number of relations is unknown or many types of\nrelations exist. The flexibility of our DSLR model comes from the design\nconcept of our encoder that represents the relation between entities in a\nlatent space rather than a discrete variable and a decoder that can handle many\ntypes of relations. We performed the experiments on synthetic and real-world\ngraph data with various relationships between entities, and compared the\nqualitative and quantitative results with other approaches. The experiments\nshow that the proposed method is suitable for analyzing dynamic graphs with an\nunknown number of complex relations.",

The question of their existence was raised by Karthik and\nManurangsi [Combinatorica 2020].\n(*) Threshold Graphs: For fixed integer k, a k-threshold graph is, roughly\nspeaking, a balanced bipartite graph in which the common neighbourhoods of\nk-sets of vertices on one side are much larger than those of (k+1)-sets. The\nquestion of their existence was raised by Lin [JACM 2018].\nAs applications of our constructions, we show the following conditional time\nlower bounds on the parameterized set intersection problem where, given a\ncollection of n sets over universe [n] and a parameter k, the goal is to find k\nsets with the largest intersection.\n(*) Assuming ETH, for any computable function F, no $n^{o(k)}$-time algorithm\ncan approximate the parameterized set intersection problem up to factor F(k).\nThis improves considerably on the previously best-known result under ETH due to\nLin [JACM 2018], who ruled out any $n^{o(\\sqrt{k})}$ time approximation\nalgorithm for this problem.\n(*) Assuming SETH, for every $\\varepsilon>0$ and any computable function F,\nno $n^{k-\\varepsilon}$-time algorithm can approximate the parameterized set\nintersection problem up to factor F(k).

In\nparticular, we explore the electricity cost-savings and increase in PV\nself-consumption that can be achieved by using PCMs and the operation of the\nheating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system optimised by a home\nenergy management system (HEMS). In more detail, we consider a HEMS with an\nHVAC system, rooftop PV, and a PCM layer integrated into the building envelope.\nThe objective of the HEMS optimisation is to minimise electricity costs while\nmaximising PV self-consumption and maintaining the indoor building temperature\nin a preferred comfort range. Solving this problem is challenging due to PCM's\nnonlinear characteristics, and using methods that can deal with the resulting\nnon-convexity of the optimisation problem, like dynamic programming is\ncomputationally expensive. Therefore, we use multi-timescale approximate\ndynamic programming (MADP) that we developed in our earlier work to explore a\nnumber of Australian PCM scenarios. Specifically, we analyse a large number of\nresidential buildings across five Australian capital cities. We find that using\nPCM can reduce annual electricity costs by between 10.6% in Brisbane and 19% in\nAdelaide.

    "abstract": "Machine learning models that are developed to be invariant under certain\ntypes of data transformations have shown improved generalization in practice.\nHowever, a principled understanding of why invariance benefits generalization\nis limited. Given a dataset, there is often no principled way to select\n\"suitable\" data transformations under which model invariance guarantees better\ngeneralization. This paper studies the generalization benefit of model\ninvariance by introducing the sample cover induced by transformations, i.e., a\nrepresentative subset of a dataset that can approximately recover the whole\ndataset using transformations. For any data transformations, we provide refined\ngeneralization bounds for invariant models based on the sample cover. We also\ncharacterize the \"suitability\" of a set of data transformations by the sample\ncovering number induced by transformations, i.e., the smallest size of its\ninduced sample covers. We show that we may tighten the generalization bounds\nfor \"suitable\" transformations that have a small sample covering number. In\naddition, our proposed sample covering number can be empirically evaluated and\nthus provides a guide for selecting transformations to develop model invariance\nfor better generalization. In experiments on multiple datasets, we evaluate\nsample covering numbers for some commonly used transformations and show that\nthe smaller sample covering number for a set of transformations (e.g., the\n3D-view transformation) indicates a smaller gap between the test and training\nerror for invariant models, which verifies our propositions.",

    "abstract": "In current practice, scene survey is carried out by workers using total\nstations. The method has high accuracy, but it incurs high costs if continuous\nmonitoring is needed. Techniques based on photogrammetry, with the relatively\ncheaper digital cameras, have gained wide applications in many fields. Besides\npoint measurement, photogrammetry can also create a three-dimensional (3D)\nmodel of the scene. Accurate 3D model reconstruction depends on high quality\nimages. Degraded images will result in large errors in the reconstructed 3D\nmodel. In this paper, we propose a method that can be used to improve the\nvisibility of the images, and eventually reduce the errors of the 3D scene\nmodel. The idea is inspired by image dehazing. Each original image is first\ntransformed into multiple exposure images by means of gamma-correction\noperations and adaptive histogram equalization. The transformed images are\nanalyzed by the computation of the local binary patterns. The image is then\nenhanced, with each pixel generated from the set of transformed image pixels\nweighted by a function of the local pattern feature and image saturation.\nPerformance evaluation has been performed on benchmark image dehazing datasets.\nExperimentations have been carried out on outdoor and indoor surveys. Our\nanalysis finds that the method works on different types of degradation that\nexist in both outdoor and indoor images.

    "abstract": "For the scalability of industrial online advertising systems, a two-stage\nauction architecture is widely used to enable efficient ad allocation on a\nlarge set of corpus within a limited response time. The current deployed\ntwo-stage ad auction usually retrieves an ad subset by a coarse ad quality\nmetric in a pre-auction stage, and then determines the auction outcome by a\nrefined metric in the subsequent stage. However, this simple and greedy\nsolution suffers from serious performance degradation, as it regards the\ndecision in each stage separately, leading to an improper ad selection metric\nfor the pre-auction stage. In this work, we explicitly investigate the relation\nbetween the coarse and refined ad quality metrics, and design a two-stage ad\nauction by taking the decision interaction between the two stages into account.\nWe decouple the design of the two-stage auction by solving a stochastic subset\nselection problem in the pre-auction stage and conducting a general second\nprice (GSP) auction in the second stage. We demonstrate that this decouple\nstill preserves the incentive compatibility of the auction mechanism. As the\nproposed formulation of the pre-auction stage is an NP-hard problem, we propose\na scalable approximation solution by defining a new subset selection metric,\nnamely Pre-Auction Score (PAS).

    "abstract": "In computed tomography (CT), the relative trajectories of a sample, a\ndetector, and a signal source are traditionally considered to be known, since\nthey are caused by the intentional preprogrammed movement of the instrument\nparts. However, due to the mechanical backlashes, rotation sensor measurement\nerrors, thermal deformations real trajectory differs from desired ones. This\nnegatively affects the resulting quality of tomographic reconstruction. Neither\nthe calibration nor preliminary adjustments of the device completely eliminates\nthe inaccuracy of the trajectory but significantly increase the cost of\ninstrument maintenance. A number of approaches to this problem are based on an\nautomatic refinement of the source and sensor position estimate relative to the\nsample for each projection (at each time step) during the reconstruction\nprocess. A similar problem of position refinement while observing different\nimages of an object from different angles is well known in robotics\n(particularly, in mobile robots and self-driving vehicles) and is called\nSimultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). The scientific novelty of this\nwork is to consider the problem of trajectory refinement in microtomography as\na SLAM problem. This is achieved by extracting Speeded Up Robust Features\n(SURF) features from X-ray projections, filtering matches with Random Sample\nConsensus (RANSAC), calculating angles between projections, and using them in\nfactor graph in combination with stepper motor control signals in order to\nrefine rotation angles.",

It is especially important in\nmulti-sided recommendation platforms where it may be crucial to optimize\nutilities not just for the end user, but also for other actors such as item\nsellers or producers who desire a fair representation of their items. Existing\nsolutions do not properly address various aspects of multi-sided fairness in\nrecommendations as they may either solely have one-sided view (i.e. improving\nthe fairness only for one side), or do not appropriately measure the fairness\nfor each actor involved in the system. In this thesis, I aim at first\ninvestigating the impact of unfair recommendations on the system and how these\nunfair recommendations can negatively affect major actors in the system. Then,\nI seek to propose solutions to tackle the unfairness of recommendations. I\npropose a rating transformation technique that works as a pre-processing step\nbefore building the recommendation model to alleviate the inherent popularity\nbias in the input data and consequently to mitigate the exposure unfairness for\nitems and suppliers in the recommendation lists. Also, as another solution, I\npropose a general graph-based solution that works as a post-processing approach\nafter recommendation generation for mitigating the multi-sided exposure bias in\nthe recommendation results. For evaluation, I introduce several metrics for\nmeasuring the exposure fairness for items and suppliers, and show that these\nmetrics better capture the fairness properties in the recommendation results. I\nperform extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed\nsolutions. The experiments on different publicly-available datasets and\ncomparison with various baselines confirm the superiority of the proposed\nsolutions in improving the exposure fairness for items and suppliers.",

However, the unique characteristics of\nvehicular networks such as high mobility and frequent communication\ninterruptions make content delivery to end-users under strict delay constrains\nan extremely challenging task. In this paper, we propose a social-aware\nvehicular edge computing architecture that solves the content delivery problem\nby using some of the vehicles in the network as edge servers that can store and\nstream popular content to close-by end-users. The proposed architecture\nincludes three components. First, we propose a social-aware graph pruning\nsearch algorithm that computes and assigns the vehicles to the shortest path\nwith the most relevant vehicular content providers. Secondly, we use a\ntraffic-aware content recommendation scheme to recommend relevant content\naccording to their social context. This scheme uses graph embeddings in which\nthe vehicles are represented by a set of low-dimension vectors (vehicle2vec) to\nstore information about previously consumed content. Finally, we propose a Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) method to optimize the content provider vehicles\ndistribution across the network.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are software applications that help users find items of\ninterest in situations of information overload in a personalized way, using\nknowledge about the needs and preferences of individual users. In\nconversational recommendation approaches, these needs and preferences are\nacquired by the system in an interactive, multi-turn dialog. A common approach\nin the literature to drive such dialogs is to incrementally ask users about\ntheir preferences regarding desired and undesired item features or regarding\nindividual items. A central research goal in this context is efficiency,\nevaluated with respect to the number of required interactions until a\nsatisfying item is found. This is usually accomplished by making inferences\nabout the best next question to ask to the user. Today, research on dialog\nefficiency is almost entirely empirical, aiming to demonstrate, for example,\nthat one strategy for selecting questions is better than another one in a given\napplication. With this work, we complement empirical research with a\ntheoretical, domain-independent model of conversational recommendation. This\nmodel, which is designed to cover a range of application scenarios, allows us\nto investigate the efficiency of conversational approaches in a formal way, in\nparticular with respect to the computational complexity of devising optimal\ninteraction strategies. Through such a theoretical analysis we show that\nfinding an efficient conversational strategy is NP-hard, and in PSPACE in\ngeneral, but for particular kinds of catalogs the upper bound lowers to\nPOLYLOGSPACE. From a practical point of view, this result implies that catalog\ncharacteristics can strongly influence the efficiency of individual\nconversational strategies and should therefore be considered when designing new\nstrategies. A preliminary empirical analysis on datasets derived from a\nreal-world one aligns with our findings.",

We consider\nthe heat equation as the partial differential equation (PDE) in the bulk\ndomain, and the domain motion is described by an ordinary differential equation\n(ODE), coupled to the bulk partial differential equation through the transfer\nof forces at the moving interface. The discretisation is based on an unfitted\nfinite element discretisation on a time-independent mesh.

    "abstract": "Predicting 3D shapes and poses of static objects from a single RGB image is\nan important research area in modern computer vision. Its applications range\nfrom augmented reality to robotics and digital content creation. Typically this\ntask is performed through direct object shape and pose predictions which is\ninaccurate. A promising research direction ensures meaningful shape predictions\nby retrieving CAD models from large scale databases and aligning them to the\nobjects observed in the image. However, existing work does not take the object\ngeometry into account, leading to inaccurate object pose predictions,\nespecially for unseen objects. In this work we demonstrate how cross-domain\nkeypoint matches from an RGB image to a rendered CAD model allow for more\nprecise object pose predictions compared to ones obtained through direct\npredictions. We further show that keypoint matches can not only be used to\nestimate the pose of an object, but also to modify the shape of the object\nitself. This is important as the accuracy that can be achieved with object\nretrieval alone is inherently limited to the available CAD models. Allowing\nshape adaptation bridges the gap between the retrieved CAD model and the\nobserved shape. We demonstrate our approach on the challenging Pix3D dataset.\nThe proposed geometric shape prediction improves the AP mesh over the\nstate-of-the-art from 33.2 to 37.8 on seen objects and from 8.2 to 17.1 on\nunseen objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate more accurate shape predictions\nwithout closely matching CAD models when following the proposed shape\nadaptation.

    "abstract": "We discuss different cases of dissipative Hamiltonian differential-algebraic\nequations and the linear algebraic systems that arise in their linearization or\ndiscretization. For each case we give examples from practical applications. An\nimportant feature of the linear algebraic systems is that the (non-Hermitian)\nsystem matrix has a positive definite or semidefinite Hermitian part. In the\npositive definite case we can solve the linear algebraic systems iteratively by\nKrylov subspace methods based on efficient three-term recurrences. We\nillustrate the performance of these iterative methods on several examples. The\nsemidefinite case can be challenging and requires additional techniques to deal\nwith \"singular part\", while the \"positive definite part\" can still be treated\nwith the three-term recurrence methods.",

Our insight is that optical flow, a\ntechnique normally used for motion estimation in video, can also provide an\neffective representation for corresponding cloth poses across observation and\ngoal images. We introduce FabricFlowNet (FFN), a cloth manipulation policy that\nleverages flow as both an input and as an action representation to improve\nperformance. FabricFlowNet also elegantly switches between bimanual and\nsingle-arm actions based on the desired goal. We show that FabricFlowNet\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art model-free and model-based cloth\nmanipulation policies that take image input. We also present real-world\nexperiments on a bimanual system, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer.\nFinally, we show that our method generalizes when trained on a single square\ncloth to other cloth shapes, such as T-shirts and rectangular cloths.

However, PDEs based on practical considerations contain\nmultiple physical quantities and complex initial boundary conditions, thus\nPINNs often returns incorrect results. Here we take heat transfer problem in\nmultilayer fabrics as a typical example. It is coupled by multiple temperature\nfields with strong correlation, and the values of variables are extremely\nunbalanced among different dimensions. We clarify the potential difficulties of\nsolving such problems by classic PINNs, and propose a parallel physics-informed\nneural networks with bidirectional balance. In detail, our parallel solving\nframework synchronously fits coupled equations through several multilayer\nperceptions. Moreover, we design two modules to balance forward process of data\nand back-propagation process of loss gradient. This bidirectional balance not\nonly enables the whole network to converge stably, but also helps to fully\nlearn various physical conditions in PDEs. We provide a series of ablation\nexperiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Similarly to [Wang, 2020], conditional alignment means that\nsimilar samples should have similar features, but conditionally on the\nmeta-data. Instead, global uniformity means that the (normalized) features\nshould be uniformly distributed on the unit hyper-sphere, independently of the\nmeta-data.

Effective ICC resolution requires precisely identifying entry\npoints, tracking data values of ICC fields, modeling related framework APIs,\netc. Due to the multiple complex characteristics involved, the evaluation of\nICC resolution approaches is challenging. Although a set of ICC-related\nhand-made benchmarks are publicly available, which supports the assessments on\nparts of the characteristics, the practical evaluations on more complicated\nscenarios are not available due to the lack of a reliable oracle from\nreal-world apps. In this paper, we carried out the research to answer three key\nquestions: 1) to what extent can the existing benchmarks contribute to the\nevaluation of ICC resolution}; 2) how to construct the practical,\nrepresentative, and reliable oracle of real-world apps; 3) what are the pros\nand cons of the state-of-the-art ICC resolution tools. First, we performed\npre-evaluations of tools on two sets of benchmarks, including four hand-made\nones and a large-scale dataset with 4,000 real-world apps, using metrics\nadopted in existing works as well as three graph-based ones proposed by us. For\na more practical evaluation, we designed a stack-based trace analysis approach\nto extract reliable ICC links and manually labeled the involved code\ncharacteristics for 1,452 links. With the newly constructed oracle, we\nconducted another evaluation of the existing tools. Based on the evaluation\nresults, we identified the limitations of the existing tools and developed a\nnew ICC resolution tool ICCBot, which achieves better performance on both the\nhand-made and real-world apps.",

Specifically, this paper focuses on constrained MASes where agents\nwork \\textit{cooperatively} to maximize the expected team-average return under\nvarious constraints on expected team-average costs, and develops a\n\\textit{constrained cooperative MARL} framework, named DeCOM, for such MASes.\nIn particular, DeCOM decomposes the policy of each agent into two modules,\nwhich empowers information sharing among agents to achieve better cooperation.\nIn addition, with such modularization, the training algorithm of DeCOM\nseparates the original constrained optimization into an unconstrained\noptimization on reward and a constraints satisfaction problem on costs. DeCOM\nthen iteratively solves these problems in a computationally efficient manner,\nwhich makes DeCOM highly scalable.

The assumption underlying statistical ML resulting in theoretical or\nempirical performance guarantees is that the distribution of the training data\nis representative of the production data distribution. This assumption often\nbreaks; for instance, statistical distributions of the data may change. We term\nchanges that affect ML performance `data drift' or `drift'.\nMany classification techniques compute a measure of confidence in their\nresults. This measure might not reflect the actual ML performance. A famous\nexample is the Panda picture that is correctly classified as such with a\nconfidence of about 60\\%, but when noise is added it is incorrectly classified\nas a Gibbon with a confidence of above 99\\%. However, the work we report on\nhere suggests that a classifier's measure of confidence can be used for the\npurpose of detecting data drift.\nWe propose an approach based solely on classifier suggested labels and its\nconfidence in them, for alerting on data distribution or feature space changes\nthat are likely to cause data drift. Our approach identities degradation in\nmodel performance and does not require labeling of data in production which is\noften lacking or delayed. Our experiments with three different data sets and\nclassifiers demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in detecting data\ndrift. This is especially encouraging as the classification itself may or may\nnot be correct and no model input data is required. We further explore the\nstatistical approach of sequential change-point tests to automatically\ndetermine the amount of data needed in order to identify drift while\ncontrolling the false positive rate (Type-1 error).",

    "abstract": "In this work we developed a mathematical model and a simulation platform for\na fish-inspired robotic template, namely Magnetic, Modular, Undulatory Robotics\n($\\mu$Bots). Through this platform, we systematically explored the effects of\ndesign and fluid parameters on the swimming performance via reinforcement\nlearning. The mathematical model was composed of two interacting subsystems,\nthe robot dynamics and the hydrodynamics, and the hydrodynamic model consisted\nof reactive components (added-mass and pressure forces) and resistive\ncomponents (drag and friction forces), which were then nondimensionalized for\nderiving key \"control parameters\" of robot-fluid interaction. The $\\mu$Bot was\nactuated via magnetic actuators controlled with harmonic voltage signals, which\nwere optimized via EM-based Policy Hyper Parameter Exploration (EPHE) to\nmaximize swimming speed. By varying the control parameters, total 36 cases with\ndifferent robot template variations (Number of Actuation (NoA) and stiffness)\nand hydrodynamic parameters were simulated and optimized via EPHE. Results\nshowed that wavelength of optimized gaits (i.e., traveling wave along body) was\nindependent of template variations and hydrodynamic parameters. Higher NoA\nyielded higher speed but lower speed per body length however with diminishing\ngain and lower speed per body length. Body and caudal-fin gait dynamics were\ndominated by the interaction among fluid added-mass, spring, and actuation\ntorque, with negligible contribution from fluid resistive drag. In contrast,\nthrust generation was dominated by pressure force acting on caudal fin, as\nsteady swimming resulted from a balance between resistive force and pressure\nforce, with minor contributions from added-mass and body drag forces.\nTherefore, added-mass force only indirectly affected the thrust generation and\nswimming speed via the caudal fin dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The impact of increased stiffness and pulsatile load on the circulation and\ntheir influence on heart performance have been documented not only for\ncardiovascular events but also for ventricular dysfunctions. For this reason,\ncomputer models of cardiac electromechanics (EM) have to integrate effects of\nthe circulatory system on heart function to be relevant for clinical\napplications. Currently it is not feasible to consider three-dimensional (3D)\nmodels of the entire circulation. Instead, simplified representations of the\ncirculation are used, ensuring a satisfactory trade-off between accuracy and\ncomputational cost. In this work, we propose a novel and stable strategy to\ncouple a 3D EM model of the heart to a one-dimensional (1D) model of blood flow\nin the arterial system. A personalised coupled 3D-1D model of LV and arterial\nsystem is built and used in a numerical benchmark to demonstrate robustness and\naccuracy of our scheme over a range of time steps. Validation of the coupled\nmodel is performed by investigating the coupled system's physiological response\nto variations in the arterial system affecting pulse wave propagation,\ncomprising aortic stiffening, aortic stenosis or bifurcations causing wave\nreflections. Our results show that the coupled 3D-1D model is robust, stable\nand correctly replicates known physiology. In comparison with standard coupled\n3D-0D models, additional computational costs are negligible, thus facilitating\nthe use of our coupled 3D-1D model as a key methodology in studies where wave\npropagation effects are under investigation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been an increasing interest in applying attention\nmechanisms in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to solve computer vision\ntasks. Most of these methods learn to explicitly identify and highlight\nrelevant parts of the scene and pass the attended image to further layers of\nthe network. In this paper, we argue that such an approach might not be\noptimal. Arguably, explicitly learning which parts of the image are relevant is\ntypically harder than learning which parts of the image are less relevant and,\nthus, should be ignored. In fact, in vision domain, there are many\neasy-to-identify patterns of irrelevant features. For example, image regions\nclose to the borders are less likely to contain useful information for a\nclassification task. Based on this idea, we propose to reformulate the\nattention mechanism in CNNs to learn to ignore instead of learning to attend.\nSpecifically, we propose to explicitly learn irrelevant information in the\nscene and suppress it in the produced representation, keeping only important\nattributes. This implicit attention scheme can be incorporated into any\nexisting attention mechanism. In this work, we validate this idea using two\nrecent attention methods Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block and Convolutional\nBlock Attention Module (CBAM). Experimental results on different datasets and\nmodel architectures show that learning to ignore, i.e., implicit attention,\nyields superior performance compared to the standard approaches.",

    "abstract": "Sparse training is a natural idea to accelerate the training speed of deep\nneural networks and save the memory usage, especially since large modern neural\nnetworks are significantly over-parameterized. However, most of the existing\nmethods cannot achieve this goal in practice because the chain rule based\ngradient (w.r.t. structure parameters) estimators adopted by previous methods\nrequire dense computation at least in the backward propagation step. This paper\nsolves this problem by proposing an efficient sparse training method with\ncompletely sparse forward and backward passes. We first formulate the training\nprocess as a continuous minimization problem under global sparsity constraint.\nWe then separate the optimization process into two steps, corresponding to\nweight update and structure parameter update. For the former step, we use the\nconventional chain rule, which can be sparse via exploiting the sparse\nstructure. For the latter step, instead of using the chain rule based gradient\nestimators as in existing methods, we propose a variance reduced policy\ngradient estimator, which only requires two forward passes without backward\npropagation, thus achieving completely sparse training. We prove that the\nvariance of our gradient estimator is bounded. Extensive experimental results\non real-world datasets demonstrate that compared to previous methods, our\nalgorithm is much more effective in accelerating the training process, up to an\norder of magnitude faster.",

Surprisingly, recent works show that large graphs\noften involve many redundant components that can be removed without\ncompromising the performance too much.

Although\nexisting computational approaches achieve inspiring results, they ignore that\nthe action of a drug is mainly caused by its chemical substructures.

Results: In this paper, by\nsupposing that the interactions between two given drugs are caused by their\nlocal chemical structures (sub-structures) and their DDI types are determined\nby the linkages between different substructure sets, we design a novel\nSubstructure-ware Tensor Neural Network model for DDI prediction (STNN-DDI).\nThe proposed model learns a 3-D tensor of (substructure, in-teraction type,\nsubstructure) triplets, which characterizes a substructure-substructure\ninteraction (SSI) space. According to a list of predefined substructures with\nspecific chemical meanings, the mapping of drugs into this SSI space enables\nSTNN-DDI to perform the multiple-type DDI prediction in both transductive and\ninductive scenarios in a unified form with an explicable manner.

    "abstract": "Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged as a new analog power-domain\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique for low-latency\nmodel/gradient-updates aggregation in federated edge learning (FEEL). By\nintegrating communication and computation into a joint design, AirComp can\nsignificantly enhance the communication efficiency, but at the cost of\naggregation errors caused by channel fading and noise. This paper studies a\nparticular type of FEEL with federated averaging (FedAvg) and AirComp-based\nmodel-update aggregation, namely over-the-air FedAvg (Air-FedAvg). We\ninvestigate the transmission power control to combat against the AirComp\naggregation errors for enhancing the training accuracy and accelerating the\ntraining speed of Air-FedAvg. Towards this end, we first analyze the\nconvergence behavior (in terms of the optimality gap) of Air-FedAvg with\naggregation errors at different outer iterations. Then, to enhance the training\naccuracy, we minimize the optimality gap by jointly optimizing the transmission\npower control at edge devices and the denoising factors at edge server, subject\nto a series of power constraints at individual edge devices. Furthermore, to\naccelerate the training speed, we also minimize the training latency of\nAir-FedAvg with a given targeted optimality gap, in which learning\nhyper-parameters including the numbers of outer iterations and local training\nepochs are jointly optimized with the power control. Finally, numerical results\nshow that the proposed transmission power control policy achieves significantly\nfaster convergence for Air-FedAvg, as compared with benchmark policies with\nfixed power transmission or per-iteration mean squared error (MSE)\nminimization.

Identifying important sentences, facts and\narguments in a legal case is such a tedious task for legal professionals. In\nthis research we explore the usage of sentence embeddings for multi-class\nclassification to identify important sentences in a legal case, in the\nperspective of the main parties present in the case.

This model aims to increase the overall\naccuracy of metadata extraction compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.\nIt enables the utilization of both spatial and contextual features in order to\nachieve a more reliable extraction.

This\nwork proposes a phone-use monitoring system, which detects the start of the\ndriver's handheld phone use and eliminates the distraction at once.\nSpecifically, the proposed system emits periodic ultrasonic pulses to sense if\nthe phone is being held in hand or placed on support surfaces (e.g., seat and\ncup holder) by capturing the unique signal interference resulted from the\ncontact object's damping, reflection and refraction. We derive the short-time\nFourier transform from the microphone data to describe such impacts and develop\na CNN-based binary classifier to discriminate the phone use between the\nhandheld and the handsfree status. Additionally, we design an adaptive\nwindow-based filter to correct the classification errors and identify each\nhandheld phone distraction instance, including its start, end, and duration.\nExtensive experiments with fourteen people, three phones and two car models\nshow that our system achieves 99% accuracy of recognizing handheld phone-use\ninstances and 0.76-second median error to estimate the distraction's start\ntime.",

Recent\nTransformer-based VLN methods have made great progress benefiting from the\ndirect connections between visual observations and the language instruction via\nthe multimodal cross-attention mechanism. However, these methods usually\nrepresent temporal context as a fixed-length vector by using an LSTM decoder or\nusing manually designed hidden states to build a recurrent Transformer.\nConsidering a single fixed-length vector is often insufficient to capture\nlong-term temporal context, in this paper, we introduce Multimodal Transformer\nwith Variable-length Memory (MTVM) for visually-grounded natural language\nnavigation by modelling the temporal context explicitly. Specifically, MTVM\nenables the agent to keep track of the navigation trajectory by directly\nstoring previous activations in a memory bank. To further boost the\nperformance, we propose a memory-aware consistency loss to help learn a better\njoint representation of temporal context with random masked instructions.

    "title": "Secure and Reliable Transfer Learning Framework for 6G-enabled Internet  of Vehicles",
    "abstract": "In the coming 6G era, Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has been evolving towards\n6G-enabled IoV with super-high data rate, seamless networking coverage, and\nubiquitous intelligence by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Transfer Learning (TL)\nhas great potential to empower promising 6G-enabled IoV, such as smart driving\nassistance, with its outstanding features including enhancing quality and\nquantity of training data, speeding up learning processes and reducing\ncomputing demands. Although TL had been widely adopted in wireless applications\n(e.g., spectrum management and caching), its reliability and security in\n6G-enabled IoV were still not well investigated. For instance, malicious\nvehicles in source domains may transfer and share untrustworthy models (i.e.,\nknowledge) about connection availability to target domains, thus adversely\naffecting the performance of learning processes. Therefore, it is important to\nselect and also incentivize trustworthy vehicles to participate in TL. In this\narticle, we first introduce the integration of TL and 6G-enbaled IoV and\nprovide TL applications for 6G-enabled IoV. We then design a secure and\nreliable transfer learning framework by using reputation to evaluate the\nreliability of pre-trained models and utilizing the consortium blockchain to\nachieve secure and efficient decentralized reputation management. Moreover, a\ndeep learning-based auction scheme for the TL model market is designed to\nmotivate high-reputation vehicles to participate in model sharing. Finally, the\nsimulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework is secure and\nreliable with well-design incentives for TL in 6G-enabled IoV.",

    "abstract": "We tackle the cross-modal retrieval problem, where the training is only\nsupervised by the relevant multi-modal pairs in the data. The contrastive\nlearning is the most popular approach for this task. However, its sampling\ncomplexity for learning is quadratic in the number of training data points.\nMoreover, it makes potentially wrong assumption that the instances in different\npairs are automatically irrelevant. To address these issues, we propose a novel\nloss function that is based on self-labeling of the unknown classes.\nSpecifically, we aim to predict class labels of the data instances in each\nmodality, and assign those labels to the corresponding instances in the other\nmodality (i.e., swapping the pseudo labels). With these swapped labels, we\nlearn the data embedding for each modality using the supervised cross-entropy\nloss, hence leading to linear sampling complexity. We also maintain the queues\nfor storing the embeddings of the latest batches, for which clustering\nassignment and embedding learning are done at the same time in an online\nfashion. This removes computational overhead of injecting intermittent epochs\nof entire training data sweep for offline clustering. We tested our approach on\nseveral real-world cross-modal retrieval problems, including text-based video\nretrieval, sketch-based image retrieval, and image-text retrieval, and for all\nthese tasks our method achieves significant performance improvement over the\ncontrastive learning.",

As such, what is valued by one community may not be valued by\nanother. In this work, we measure community values through a survey of 2,769\nreddit users in 2,151 unique subreddits, the largest survey of community values\nto date. Through a combination of survey responses and a quantitative analysis\nof publicly available reddit data, we characterize how these values vary within\nand across communities. We find that there is 47.4% more disagreement over how\nsafe communities are than disagreement over other aspects of communities'\ncurrent state, that longstanding communities place 30.1% more emphasis on\ntrustworthiness than newer communities, and that recently joined redditors\nperceive their communities more positively than more senior redditors. We find\nthat community moderators want their communities to be 56.7% less democratic\nthan non-moderator community members. Accurate and scalable modeling of\ncommunity values enables research and governance which is tuned to each\ncommunity's different values. To this end, we demonstrate that a small number\nof automatically quantifiable features captures a substantial amount of the\nvariation in values between communities with a ROC AUC of 0.667 on a binary\nclassification task.

    "abstract": "From whirling ceiling fans to ticking clocks, the sounds that we hear subtly\nvary as we move through a scene. We ask whether these ambient sounds convey\ninformation about 3D scene structure and, if so, whether they provide a useful\nlearning signal for multimodal models. To study this, we collect a dataset of\npaired audio and RGB-D recordings from a variety of quiet indoor scenes. We\nthen train models that estimate the distance to nearby walls, given only audio\nas input. We also use these recordings to learn multimodal representations\nthrough self-supervision, by training a network to associate images with their\ncorresponding sounds. These results suggest that ambient sound conveys a\nsurprising amount of information about scene structure, and that it is a useful\nsignal for learning multimodal features.",

    "title": "Advances in Neural Rendering",
    "abstract": "Synthesizing photo-realistic images and videos is at the heart of computer\ngraphics and has been the focus of decades of research. Traditionally,\nsynthetic images of a scene are generated using rendering algorithms such as\nrasterization or ray tracing, which take specifically defined representations\nof geometry and material properties as input. Collectively, these inputs define\nthe actual scene and what is rendered, and are referred to as the scene\nrepresentation (where a scene consists of one or more objects). Example scene\nrepresentations are triangle meshes with accompanied textures (e.g., created by\nan artist), point clouds (e.g., from a depth sensor), volumetric grids (e.g.,\nfrom a CT scan), or implicit surface functions (e.g., truncated signed distance\nfields). The reconstruction of such a scene representation from observations\nusing differentiable rendering losses is known as inverse graphics or inverse\nrendering. Neural rendering is closely related, and combines ideas from\nclassical computer graphics and machine learning to create algorithms for\nsynthesizing images from real-world observations. Neural rendering is a leap\nforward towards the goal of synthesizing photo-realistic image and video\ncontent. In recent years, we have seen immense progress in this field through\nhundreds of publications that show different ways to inject learnable\ncomponents into the rendering pipeline. This state-of-the-art report on\nadvances in neural rendering focuses on methods that combine classical\nrendering principles with learned 3D scene representations, often now referred\nto as neural scene representations. A key advantage of these methods is that\nthey are 3D-consistent by design, enabling applications such as novel viewpoint\nsynthesis of a captured scene. In addition to methods that handle static\nscenes, we cover neural scene representations for modeling non-rigidly\ndeforming objects...",

The state of the art has\nfocused on conventional RGB video data acquired during minimally invasive\nsurgery, but full-scene semantic segmentation based on spectral imaging data\nand obtained during open surgery has received almost no attention to date. To\naddress this gap in the literature, we are investigating the following research\nquestions based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data of pigs acquired in an open\nsurgery setting: (1) What is an adequate representation of HSI data for neural\nnetwork-based fully automated organ segmentation, especially with respect to\nthe spatial granularity of the data (pixels vs. superpixels vs. patches vs.\nfull images)? (2) Is there a benefit of using HSI data compared to other\nmodalities, namely RGB data and processed HSI data (e.g. tissue parameters like\noxygenation), when performing semantic organ segmentation? According to a\ncomprehensive validation study based on 506 HSI images from 20 pigs, annotated\nwith a total of 19 classes, deep learning-based segmentation performance\nincreases - consistently across modalities - with the spatial context of the\ninput data. Unprocessed HSI data offers an advantage over RGB data or processed\ndata from the camera provider, with the advantage increasing with decreasing\nsize of the input to the neural network. Maximum performance (HSI applied to\nwhole images) yielded a mean dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.89\n(standard deviation (SD) 0.04), which is in the range of the inter-rater\nvariability (DSC of 0.89 (SD 0.07)). We conclude that HSI could become a\npowerful image modality for fully-automatic surgical scene understanding with\nmany advantages over traditional imaging, including the ability to recover\nadditional functional tissue information.",

    "abstract": "Although deep learning (DL) has achieved notable progress in speech\nenhancement (SE), further research is still required for a DL-based SE system\nto adapt effectively and efficiently to particular speakers. In this study, we\npropose a novel meta-learning-based speaker-adaptive SE approach (called OSSEM)\nthat aims to achieve SE model adaptation in a one-shot manner. OSSEM consists\nof a modified transformer SE network and a speaker-specific masking (SSM)\nnetwork. In practice, the SSM network takes an enrolled speaker embedding\nextracted using ECAPA-TDNN to adjust the input noisy feature through masking.\nTo evaluate OSSEM, we designed a modified Voice Bank-DEMAND dataset, in which\none utterance from the testing set was used for model adaptation, and the\nremaining utterances were used for testing the performance. Moreover, we set\nrestrictions allowing the enhancement process to be conducted in real time, and\nthus designed OSSEM to be a causal SE system. Experimental results first show\nthat OSSEM can effectively adapt a pretrained SE model to a particular speaker\nwith only one utterance, thus yielding improved SE results. Meanwhile, OSSEM\nexhibits a competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art causal SE\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "We consider a general setting for dynamic tensor field tomography in an\ninhomogeneous refracting and absorbing medium as inverse source problem for the\nassociated transport equation. Following Fermat's principle the Riemannian\nmetric in the considered domain is generated by the refractive index of the\nmedium. There is wealth of results for the inverse problem of recovering a\ntensor field from its longitudinal ray transform in a static euclidean setting,\nwhereas there are only few inversion formulas and algorithms existing for\ngeneral Riemannian metrics and time-dependent tensor fields. It is a well-known\nfact that tensor field tomography is equivalent to an inverse source problem\nfor a transport equation where the ray transform serves as given boundary data.\nWe prove that this result extends to the dynamic case. Interpreting dynamic\ntensor tomography as inverse source problem represents a holistic approach in\nthis field. To guarantee that the forward mappings are well-defined, it is\nnecessary to prove existence and uniqueness for the underlying transport\nequations. Unfortunately, the bilinear forms of the associated weak\nformulations do not satisfy the coercivity condition. To this end we transfer\nto viscosity solutions and prove their unique existence in appropriate Sobolev\n(static case) and Sobolev-Bochner (dynamic case) spaces under a certain\nassumption that allows only small variations of the refractive index. Numerical\nevidence is given that the viscosity solution solves the original transport\nequation if the viscosity term turns to zero.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of mortality in the world\nthat occurs due to a blockage of the coronary arteries feeding the myocardium.\nAn early diagnosis of MI and its localization can mitigate the extent of\nmyocardial damage by facilitating early therapeutic interventions. Following\nthe blockage of a coronary artery, the regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA)\nof the ischemic myocardial segments is the earliest change to set in.\nEchocardiography is the fundamental tool to assess any RWMA. Assessing the\nmotion of the left ventricle (LV) wall only from a single echocardiography view\nmay lead to missing the diagnosis of MI as the RWMA may not be visible on that\nspecific view. Therefore, in this study, we propose to fuse apical 4-chamber\n(A4C) and apical 2-chamber (A2C) views in which a total of 11 myocardial\nsegments can be analyzed for MI detection. The proposed method first estimates\nthe motion of the LV wall by Active Polynomials (APs), which extract and track\nthe endocardial boundary to compute myocardial segment displacements. The\nfeatures are extracted from the A4C and A2C view displacements, which are fused\nand fed into the classifiers to detect MI. The main contributions of this study\nare 1) creation of a new benchmark dataset by including both A4C and A2C views\nin a total of 260 echocardiography recordings, which is publicly shared with\nthe research community, 2) improving the performance of the prior work of\nthreshold-based APs by a Machine Learning based approach, and 3) a pioneer MI\ndetection approach via multi-view echocardiography by fusing the information of\nA4C and A2C views. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves\n90.91% sensitivity and 86.36% precision for MI detection over multi-view\nechocardiography.",

Alternative approaches such as Projected Gradient Descent only provide a\ncomputational benefit for simple convex sets such as Euclidean balls, where\nEuclidean projections can be performed efficiently. For other sets, the cost of\nthe projections can be too high. To circumvent these issues, alternative\nmethods based on the famous Frank-Wolfe algorithm have been studied and used.\nSuch methods use a Linear Optimization Oracle at each iteration instead of\nEuclidean projections; the former can often be performed efficiently. Such\nmethods have also been extended to the online and stochastic optimization\nsettings. However, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and its variants do not achieve\nthe optimal performance, in terms of regret or rate, for general convex sets.\nWhat is more, the Linear Optimization Oracle they use can still be\ncomputationally expensive in some cases. In this paper, we move away from\nFrank-Wolfe style algorithms and present a new reduction that turns any\nalgorithm A defined on a Euclidean ball (where projections are cheap) to an\nalgorithm on a constrained set C contained within the ball, without sacrificing\nthe performance of the original algorithm A by much. Our reduction requires O(T\nlog T) calls to a Membership Oracle on C after T rounds, and no linear\noptimization on C is needed. Using our reduction, we recover optimal regret\nbounds [resp. rates], in terms of the number of iterations, in online [resp.\nstochastic] convex optimization.
