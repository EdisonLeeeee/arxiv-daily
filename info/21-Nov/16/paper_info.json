    "title": "Learning Generalized Gumbel-max Causal Mechanisms",
    "abstract": "To perform counterfactual reasoning in Structural Causal Models (SCMs), one\nneeds to know the causal mechanisms, which provide factorizations of\nconditional distributions into noise sources and deterministic functions\nmapping realizations of noise to samples. Unfortunately, the causal mechanism\nis not uniquely identified by data that can be gathered by observing and\ninteracting with the world, so there remains the question of how to choose\ncausal mechanisms. In recent work, Oberst & Sontag (2019) propose Gumbel-max\nSCMs, which use Gumbel-max reparameterizations as the causal mechanism due to\nan intuitively appealing counterfactual stability property. In this work, we\ninstead argue for choosing a causal mechanism that is best under a quantitative\ncriteria such as minimizing variance when estimating counterfactual treatment\neffects. We propose a parameterized family of causal mechanisms that generalize\nGumbel-max. We show that they can be trained to minimize counterfactual effect\nvariance and other losses on a distribution of queries of interest, yielding\nlower variance estimates of counterfactual treatment effect than fixed\nalternatives, also generalizing to queries not seen at training time.",

    "abstract": "Tasks are a fundamental unit of work in the daily lives of people, who are\nincreasingly using digital means to keep track of, organize, triage and act on\nthem. These digital tools -- such as task management applications -- provide a\nunique opportunity to study and understand tasks and their connection to the\nreal world, and through intelligent assistance, help people be more productive.\nBy logging signals such as text, timestamp information, and social connectivity\ngraphs, an increasingly rich and detailed picture of how tasks are created and\norganized, what makes them important, and who acts on them, can be\nprogressively developed. Yet the context around actual task completion remains\nfuzzy, due to the basic disconnect between actions taken in the real world and\ntelemetry recorded in the digital world. Thus, in this paper we compile and\nrelease a novel, real-life, large-scale dataset called MS-LaTTE that captures\ntwo core aspects of the context surrounding task completion: location and time.\nWe describe our annotation framework and conduct a number of analyses on the\ndata that were collected, demonstrating that it captures intuitive contextual\nproperties for common tasks. Finally, we test the dataset on the two problems\nof predicting spatial and temporal task co-occurrence, concluding that\npredictors for co-location and co-time are both learnable, with a BERT\nfine-tuned model outperforming several other baselines. The MS-LaTTE dataset\nprovides an opportunity to tackle many new modeling challenges in contextual\ntask understanding and we hope that its release will spur future research in\ntask intelligence more broadly.",

    "abstract": "Every step we take in the digital world leaves behind a record of our\nbehavior; a digital footprint. Research has suggested that algorithms can\ntranslate these digital footprints into accurate estimates of psychological\ncharacteristics, including personality traits, mental health or intelligence.\nThe mechanisms by which AI generates these insights, however, often remain\nopaque. In this paper, we show how Explainable AI (XAI) can help domain experts\nand data subjects validate, question, and improve models that classify\npsychological traits from digital footprints. We elaborate on two popular XAI\nmethods (rule extraction and counterfactual explanations) in the context of Big\nFive personality predictions (traits and facets) from financial transactions\ndata (N = 6,408). First, we demonstrate how global rule extraction sheds light\non the spending patterns identified by the model as most predictive for\npersonality, and discuss how these rules can be used to explain, validate, and\nimprove the model. Second, we implement local rule extraction to show that\nindividuals are assigned to personality classes because of their unique\nfinancial behavior, and that there exists a positive link between the model's\nprediction confidence and the number of features that contributed to the\nprediction. Our experiments highlight the importance of both global and local\nXAI methods. By better understanding how predictive models work in general as\nwell as how they derive an outcome for a particular person, XAI promotes\naccountability in a world in which AI impacts the lives of billions of people\naround the world.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, we have seen exponential growth in online content\nfueled by social media platforms. Data generation of this scale comes with the\ncaveat of insurmountable offensive content in it. The complexity of identifying\noffensive content is exacerbated by the usage of multiple modalities (image,\nlanguage, etc.), code mixed language and more. Moreover, even if we carefully\nsample and annotate offensive content, there will always exist significant\nclass imbalance in offensive vs non offensive content. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel Code-Mixing Index (CMI) based focal loss which circumvents\ntwo challenges (1) code mixing in languages (2) class imbalance problem for\nDravidian language offense detection. We also replace the conventional dot\nproduct-based classifier with the cosine-based classifier which results in a\nboost in performance. Further, we use multilingual models that help transfer\ncharacteristics learnt across languages to work effectively with low resourced\nlanguages. It is also important to note that our model handles instances of\nmixed script (say usage of Latin and Dravidian - Tamil script) as well. Our\nmodel can handle offensive language detection in a low-resource, class\nimbalanced, multilingual and code mixed setting.",

    "title": "Regular Path Query Evaluation Sharing a Reduced Transitive Closure Based  on Graph Reduction",
    "abstract": "Regular path queries (RPQs) find pairs of vertices of paths satisfying given\nregular expressions on an edge-labeled, directed multigraph. When evaluating an\nRPQ, the evaluation of a Kleene closure (i.e., Kleene plus or Kleene star) is\nvery expensive. Furthermore, when multiple RPQs include a Kleene closure as a\ncommon sub-query, repeated evaluations of the common sub-query cause serious\nperformance degradation. In this paper, we present a novel concept of RPQ-based\ngraph reduction, which significantly simplifies the original graph through\nedge-level and vertex-level reductions. Interestingly, RPQ-based graph\nreduction can replace the evaluation of the Kleene closure on the large\noriginal graph to that of the transitive closure to the small reduced graph. We\nthen propose a reduced transitive closure (RTC) as a lightweight structure for\nefficiently sharing the result of a Kleene closure. We also present an RPQ\nevaluation algorithm, RTCSharing, which treats each clause in the disjunctive\nnormal form of the given RPQ as a batch unit. If the batch units include a\nKleene closure as a common sub-query, we share the lightweight RTC instead of\nthe heavyweight result of the Kleene closure. RPQ-based graph reduction further\nenables us to formally represent the result of an RPQ including a Kleene\nclosure as a relational algebra expression including the RTC. Through the\nformal expression, we optimize the evaluation of the batch unit by eliminating\nuseless and redundant operations of the previous method. Experiments show that\nRTCSharing improves the performance significantly by up to 8.86 times compared\nwith existing methods in terms of query response time.",

    "abstract": "We aim to tackle the interesting yet challenging problem of generating videos\nof diverse and natural human motions from prescribed action categories. The key\nissue lies in the ability to synthesize multiple distinct motion sequences that\nare realistic in their visual appearances. It is achieved in this paper by a\ntwo-step process that maintains internal 3D pose and shape representations,\naction2motion and motion2video. Action2motion stochastically generates\nplausible 3D pose sequences of a prescribed action category, which are\nprocessed and rendered by motion2video to form 2D videos. Specifically, the Lie\nalgebraic theory is engaged in representing natural human motions following the\nphysical law of human kinematics; a temporal variational auto-encoder (VAE) is\ndeveloped that encourages diversity of output motions. Moreover, given an\nadditional input image of a clothed human character, an entire pipeline is\nproposed to extract his/her 3D detailed shape, and to render in videos the\nplausible motions from different views. This is realized by improving existing\nmethods to extract 3D human shapes and textures from single 2D images, rigging,\nanimating, and rendering to form 2D videos of human motions. It also\nnecessitates the curation and reannotation of 3D human motion datasets for\ntraining purpose. Thorough empirical experiments including ablation study,\nqualitative and quantitative evaluations manifest the applicability of our\napproach, and demonstrate its competitiveness in addressing related tasks,\nwhere components of our approach are compared favorably to the\nstate-of-the-arts.",

We argue that a good reconstruction\nshould have high mutual information with the ground truth. This view enables\nlearning a lightweight critic to \"calibrate\" a feature space in a contrastive\nmanner, such that reconstructions of corresponding spatial patches are brought\ntogether, while other patches are repulsed. We show that our formulation\nimmediately boosts the perceptual realism of output images when used as a\ndrop-in replacement for the L1 loss, with or without an additional GAN loss.",

    "title": "Committing to Interdependence: Implications from Game Theory for  Human-Robot Trust",
    "abstract": "Human-robot interaction and game theory have developed distinct theories of\ntrust for over three decades in relative isolation from one another.\nHuman-robot interaction has focused on the underlying dimensions, layers,\ncorrelates, and antecedents of trust models, while game theory has concentrated\non the psychology and strategies behind singular trust decisions. Both fields\nhave grappled to understand over-trust and trust calibration, as well as how to\nmeasure trust expectations, risk, and vulnerability. This paper presents\ninitial steps in closing the gap between these fields. Using insights and\nexperimental findings from interdependence theory and social psychology, this\nwork starts by analyzing a large game theory competition data set to\ndemonstrate that the strongest predictors for a wide variety of human-human\ntrust interactions are the interdependence-derived variables for commitment and\ntrust that we have developed. It then presents a second study with human\nsubject results for more realistic trust scenarios, involving both human-human\nand human-machine trust. In both the competition data and our experimental\ndata, we demonstrate that the interdependence metrics better capture social\n`overtrust' than either rational or normative psychological reasoning, as\nproposed by game theory. This work further explores how interdependence\ntheory--with its focus on commitment, coercion, and cooperation--addresses many\nof the proposed underlying constructs and antecedents within human-robot trust,\nshedding new light on key similarities and differences that arise when robots\nreplace humans in trust interactions.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing convergence between biologically plausible\ncomputational models of inference and learning with local update rules and the\nglobal gradient-based optimization of neural network models employed in machine\nlearning. One particularly exciting connection is the correspondence between\nthe locally informed optimization in predictive coding networks and the error\nbackpropagation algorithm that is used to train state-of-the-art deep\nartificial neural networks. Here we focus on the related, but still largely\nunder-explored connection between precision weighting in predictive coding\nnetworks and the Natural Gradient Descent algorithm for deep neural networks.\nPrecision-weighted predictive coding is an interesting candidate for scaling up\nuncertainty-aware optimization -- particularly for models with large parameter\nspaces -- due to its distributed nature of the optimization process and the\nunderlying local approximation of the Fisher information metric, the adaptive\nlearning rate that is central to Natural Gradient Descent. Here, we show that\nhierarchical predictive coding networks with learnable precision indeed are\nable to solve various supervised and unsupervised learning tasks with\nperformance comparable to global backpropagation with natural gradients and\noutperform their classical gradient descent counterpart on tasks where high\namounts of noise are embedded in data or label inputs.

    "abstract": "Assuming humans are (approximately) rational enables robots to infer reward\nfunctions by observing human behavior. But people exhibit a wide array of\nirrationalities, and our goal with this work is to better understand the effect\nthey can have on reward inference. The challenge with studying this effect is\nthat there are many types of irrationality, with varying degrees of\nmathematical formalization. We thus operationalize irrationality in the\nlanguage of MDPs, by altering the Bellman optimality equation, and use this\nframework to study how these alterations would affect inference.\nWe find that wrongly modeling a systematically irrational human as\nnoisy-rational performs a lot worse than correctly capturing these biases -- so\nmuch so that it can be better to skip inference altogether and stick to the\nprior! More importantly, we show that an irrational human, when correctly\nmodelled, can communicate more information about the reward than a perfectly\nrational human can. That is, if a robot has the correct model of a human's\nirrationality, it can make an even stronger inference than it ever could if the\nhuman were rational. Irrationality fundamentally helps rather than hinder\nreward inference, but it needs to be correctly accounted for.",

    "title": "Learning Online for Unified Segmentation and Tracking Models",
    "abstract": "Tracking requires building a discriminative model for the target in the\ninference stage. An effective way to achieve this is online learning, which can\ncomfortably outperform models that are only trained offline. Recent research\nshows that visual tracking benefits significantly from the unification of\nvisual tracking and segmentation due to its pixel-level discrimination.\nHowever, it imposes a great challenge to perform online learning for such a\nunified model. A segmentation model cannot easily learn from prior information\ngiven in the visual tracking scenario. In this paper, we propose TrackMLP: a\nnovel meta-learning method optimized to learn from only partial information to\nresolve the imposed challenge. Our model is capable of extensively exploiting\nlimited prior information hence possesses much stronger target-background\ndiscriminability than other online learning methods. Empirically, we show that\nour model achieves state-of-the-art performance and tangible improvement over\ncompeting models. Our model achieves improved average overlaps of66.0%,67.1%,\nand68.5% in VOT2019, VOT2018, and VOT2016 datasets, which are 6.4%,7.3%,\nand6.4% higher than our baseline.

One\naspect of the popularity of statistical forecasting models such as ETS and\nARIMA is their relative simplicity and interpretability (in terms of relevant\nlags, trend, seasonality, and others), while GFMs typically lack\ninterpretability, especially towards particular time series. This reduces the\ntrust and confidence of the stakeholders when making decisions based on the\nforecasts without being able to understand the predictions.

We analyze the impact\nof reusability refactorings on the state-of-the-art reusability metrics, and we\ncompare the distribution of reusability refactoring types, with the\ndistribution of the remaining mainstream refactorings. Overall, we found that\nthe distribution of refactoring types, applied in the context of reusability,\nis different from the distribution of refactoring types in mainstream\ndevelopment. In the refactorings performed to improve reusability, source files\nare subject to more design-level types of refactorings. Reusability\nrefactorings significantly impact, high-level code elements, such as packages,\nclasses, and methods, while typical refactorings, impact all code elements,\nincluding identifiers, and parameters.

In this model, the fracture is treated as an $(d-1)$-dimensional\ninterface within the $d$-dimensional fractured porous domain, for $d=2, 3$. Two\nclasses of fracture are distinguished based on the permeability magnitude ratio\nbetween the fracture and its surrounding medium: when the permeability in the\nfracture is (significantly) larger than in its surrounding medium, it is\nconsidered as a {\\it conductive} fracture; when the permeability in the\nfracture is (significantly) smaller than in its surrounding medium, it is\nconsidered as a {\\it blocking} fracture. The conductive fractures are treated\nusing the classical hybrid-dimensional approach of the interface model where\npressure is assumed to be continuous across the fracture interfaces, while the\nblocking fractures are treated using the recent Dirac-$\\delta$ function\napproach where normal component of Darcy velocity is assumed to be continuous\nacross the interface. Due to the use of Dirac-$\\delta$ function approach for\nthe blocking fractures, our numerical scheme allows for nonconforming meshes\nwith respect to the blocking fractures.

Moreover, our numerical scheme produces locally\nconservative velocity approximations and leads to a symmetric positive definite\nlinear system involving pressure degrees of freedom on the mesh skeleton only.\nThe performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by various benchmark\ntest cases in both two- and three-dimensions.

These features can subsequently provide information about the\npopulation shape variation. Dense correspondence models can provide ease of\ncomputation and yield an interpretable low-dimensional shape descriptor when\nfollowed by dimensionality reduction. However, automatic methods for obtaining\nsuch correspondences usually require image segmentation followed by significant\npreprocessing, which is taxing in terms of both computation as well as human\nresources. In many cases, the segmentation and subsequent processing require\nmanual guidance and anatomy specific domain expertise. This paper proposes a\nself-supervised deep learning approach for discovering landmarks from images\nthat can directly be used as a shape descriptor for subsequent analysis. We use\nlandmark-driven image registration as the primary task to force the neural\nnetwork to discover landmarks that register the images well. We also propose a\nregularization term that allows for robust optimization of the neural network\nand ensures that the landmarks uniformly span the image domain. The proposed\nmethod circumvents segmentation and preprocessing and directly produces a\nusable shape descriptor using just 2D or 3D images. In addition, we also\npropose two variants on the training loss function that allows for prior shape\ninformation to be integrated into the model.

    "title": "Learning to Evolve on Dynamic Graphs",
    "abstract": "Representation learning in dynamic graphs is a challenging problem because\nthe topology of graph and node features vary at different time. This requires\nthe model to be able to effectively capture both graph topology information and\ntemporal information. Most existing works are built on recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs), which are used to exact temporal information of dynamic\ngraphs, and thus they inherit the same drawbacks of RNNs. In this paper, we\npropose Learning to Evolve on Dynamic Graphs (LEDG) - a novel algorithm that\njointly learns graph information and time information. Specifically, our\napproach utilizes gradient-based meta-learning to learn updating strategies\nthat have better generalization ability than RNN on snapshots. It is\nmodel-agnostic and thus can train any message passing based graph neural\nnetwork (GNN) on dynamic graphs. To enhance the representation power, we\ndisentangle the embeddings into time embeddings and graph intrinsic embeddings.\nWe conduct experiments on various datasets and down-stream tasks, and the\nexperimental results validate the effectiveness of our method.",

Parameter quantization\nreplaces floating-point arithmetic with lower precision fixed-point arithmetic,\nfurther reducing complexity.\nTypical training of quantized weight neural networks starts from fully\nquantized weights. Quantization creates random noise. As a way to compensate\nfor this noise, during training, we propose to quantize some weights while\nkeeping others in floating-point precision. A deep neural network has many\nlayers. To arrive at a fully quantized weight network, we start from one\nquantized layer and then quantize more and more layers. We show that the order\nof layer quantization affects accuracies. Order count is large for deep neural\nnetworks.

We apply the proposed iterative training to\nweight binarization. Our experiments cover fully connected and convolutional\nnetworks on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. We show empirically that,\nstarting from partial binary weights instead of from fully binary ones,\ntraining reaches fully binary weight networks with better accuracies for larger\nand deeper networks.

Such methods rely on networks with many parameters, which makes the\ntraining and inference time-consuming. Training lightweight neural networks\nsuch as MobileNets are often challenging, and the models might have low\naccuracy. Inspired by knowledge distillation (KD), this paper presents a novel\nloss function to train a lightweight Student network (e.g., MobileNetV2) for\nfacial landmark detection.

    "abstract": "Logic locking aims to prevent intellectual property (IP) piracy and\nunauthorized overproduction of integrated circuits (ICs). However, initial\nlogic locking techniques were vulnerable to the Boolean satisfiability\n(SAT)-based attacks. In response, researchers proposed various SAT-resistant\nlocking techniques such as point function-based locking and symmetric\ninterconnection (SAT-hard) obfuscation. We focus on the latter since point\nfunction-based locking suffers from various structural vulnerabilities. The\nSAT-hard logic locking technique, InterLock [1], achieves a unified logic and\nrouting obfuscation that thwarts state-of-the-art attacks on logic locking. In\nthis work, we propose a novel link prediction-based attack, UNTANGLE, that\nsuccessfully breaks InterLock in an oracle-less setting without having access\nto an activated IC (oracle). Since InterLock hides selected timing paths in\nkey-controlled routing blocks, UNTANGLE reveals the gates and interconnections\nhidden in the routing blocks upon formulating this task as a link prediction\nproblem. The intuition behind our approach is that ICs contain a large amount\nof repetition and reuse cores. Hence, UNTANGLE can infer the hidden timing\npaths by learning the composition of gates in the observed locked netlist or a\ncircuit library leveraging graph neural networks. We show that circuits\nwithstanding SAT-based and other attacks can be unlocked in seconds with 100%\nprecision using UNTANGLE in an oracle-less setting. UNTANGLE is a generic\nattack platform (which we also open source [2]) that applies to multiplexer\n(MUX)-based obfuscation, as demonstrated through our experiments on ISCAS-85\nand ITC-99 benchmarks locked using InterLock and random MUX-based locking.",

    "title": "Study of keyword extraction techniques for Electric Double Layer  Capacitor domain using text similarity indexes: An experimental analysis",
    "abstract": "Keywords perform a significant role in selecting various topic-related\ndocuments quite easily. Topics or keywords assigned by humans or experts\nprovide accurate information. However, this practice is quite expensive in\nterms of resources and time management. Hence, it is more satisfying to utilize\nautomated keyword extraction techniques. Nevertheless, before beginning the\nautomated process, it is necessary to check and confirm how similar\nexpert-provided and algorithm-generated keywords are. This paper presents an\nexperimental analysis of similarity scores of keywords generated by different\nsupervised and unsupervised automated keyword extraction algorithms with expert\nprovided keywords from the Electric Double Layer Capacitor (EDLC) domain. The\npaper also analyses which texts provide better keywords like positive sentences\nor all sentences of the document. From the unsupervised algorithms, YAKE,\nTopicRank, MultipartiteRank, and KPMiner are employed for keyword extraction.\nFrom the supervised algorithms, KEA and WINGNUS are employed for keyword\nextraction. To assess the similarity of the extracted keywords with\nexpert-provided keywords, Jaccard, Cosine, and Cosine with word vector\nsimilarity indexes are employed in this study. The experiment shows that the\nMultipartiteRank keyword extraction technique measured with cosine with word\nvector similarity index produces the best result with 92% similarity with\nexpert provided keywords. This study can help the NLP researchers working with\nthe EDLC domain or recommender systems to select more suitable keyword\nextraction and similarity index calculation techniques.",

    "abstract": "Teaching plays a fundamental role in human learning. Typically, a human\nteaching strategy would involve assessing a student's knowledge progress for\ntailoring the teaching materials in a way that enhances the learning progress.\nA human teacher would achieve this by tracing a student's knowledge over\nimportant learning concepts in a task. Albeit, such teaching strategy is not\nwell exploited yet in machine learning as current machine teaching methods tend\nto directly assess the progress on individual training samples without paying\nattention to the underlying learning concepts in a learning task. In this\npaper, we propose a novel method, called Knowledge Augmented Data Teaching\n(KADT), which can optimize a data teaching strategy for a student model by\ntracing its knowledge progress over multiple learning concepts in a learning\ntask. Specifically, the KADT method incorporates a knowledge tracing model to\ndynamically capture the knowledge progress of a student model in terms of\nlatent learning concepts. Then we develop an attention pooling mechanism to\ndistill knowledge representations of a student model with respect to class\nlabels, which enables to develop a data teaching strategy on critical training\nsamples. We have evaluated the performance of the KADT method on four different\nmachine learning tasks including knowledge tracing, sentiment analysis, movie\nrecommendation, and image classification. The results comparing to the\nstate-of-the-art methods empirically validate that KADT consistently\noutperforms others on all tasks.",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing is one of the most promising technology advances of the\nlatest years. Once only a conceptual idea to solve physics simulations, quantum\ncomputation is today a reality, with numerous machines able to execute quantum\nalgorithms. One of the hardest challenges in quantum computing is reliability.\nQubits are highly sensitive to noise, which can make the output useless.\nMoreover, lately it has been shown that superconducting qubits are extremely\nsusceptible to external sources of faults, such as ionizing radiation. When\nadopted in large scale, radiation-induced errors are expected to become a\nserious challenge for qubits reliability. In this paper, we propose an\nevaluation of the impact of transient faults in the execution of quantum\ncircuits. Inspired by the Architectural and Program Vulnerability Factors,\nwidely adopted to characterize the reliability of classical computing\narchitectures and algorithms, we propose the Quantum Vulnerability Factor (QVF)\nas a metric to measure the impact that the corruption of a qubit has on the\ncircuit output probability distribution. First, we model faults based on the\nlatest studies on real machines and recently performed radiation experiments.\nThen, we design a quantum fault injector, built over Qiskit, and characterize\nthe propagation of faults in quantum circuits. We report the finding of more\nthan 15,000,000 fault injections, evaluating the reliability of three quantum\ncircuits and identifying the faults and qubits that are more likely than others\nto impact the output. With our results, we give guidelines on how to map the\nqubits in the real quantum computer to reduce the output error and to reduce\nthe probability of having a radiation-induced corruption to modify the output.\nFinally, we compare the simulation results with experiments on physical quantum\ncomputers.",

    "abstract": "Cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated and diverse, making detection\nincreasingly challenging. To combat these attacks, security practitioners\nactively summarize and exchange their knowledge about attacks across\norganizations in the form of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports. However,\nas CTI reports written in natural language texts are not structured for\nautomatic analysis, the report usage requires tedious efforts of manual cyber\nintelligence recovery. Additionally, individual reports typically cover only a\nlimited aspect of attack patterns (techniques) and thus are insufficient to\nprovide a comprehensive view of attacks with multiple variants.\nTo take advantage of threat intelligence delivered by CTI reports, we propose\nAttacKG to automatically extract structured attack behavior graphs from CTI\nreports and identify the adopted attack techniques. We then aggregate cyber\nintelligence across reports to collect different aspects of techniques and\nenhance attack behavior graphs as technique knowledge graphs (TKGs). Such TKGs\nwith technique-level intelligence directly benefit downstream security tasks\nthat rely on technique specifications, e.g., Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)\ndetection.\nIn our evaluation against 1,515 real-world CTI reports from diverse\nintelligence sources, AttacKG effectively identifies 28,262 attack techniques\nwith 8,393 unique Indicators of Compromises (IoCs). Further, to verify\nAttacKG's accuracy in extracting threat intelligence, we run AttacKG on eight\nmanually labeled CTI reports. Empirical results show that AttacKG accurately\nidentifies attack-relevant entities, dependencies, and techniques with\nF1-scores of 0.895, 0.911, and 0.819, which significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art approaches like EXTRACTOR and TTPDrill.",

    "abstract": "Affective computing is very important in the relationship between man and\nmachine. In this paper, a system for speech emotion recognition (SER) based on\nspeech signal is proposed, which uses new techniques in different stages of\nprocessing. The system consists of three stages: feature extraction, feature\nselection, and finally feature classification. In the first stage, a complex\nset of long-term statistics features is extracted from both the speech signal\nand the glottal-waveform signal using a combination of new and diverse features\nsuch as prosodic, spectral, and spectro-temporal features. One of the\nchallenges of the SER systems is to distinguish correlated emotions. These\nfeatures are good discriminators for speech emotions and increase the SER's\nability to recognize similar and different emotions. This feature vector with a\nlarge number of dimensions naturally has redundancy. In the second stage, using\nclassical feature selection techniques as well as a new quantum-inspired\ntechnique to reduce the feature vector dimensionality, the number of feature\nvector dimensions is reduced. In the third stage, the optimized feature vector\nis classified by a weighted deep sparse extreme learning machine (ELM)\nclassifier. The classifier performs classification in three steps: sparse\nrandom feature learning, orthogonal random projection using the singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) technique, and discriminative classification in the last\nstep using the generalized Tikhonov regularization technique. Also, many\nexisting emotional datasets suffer from the problem of data imbalanced\ndistribution, which in turn increases the classification error and decreases\nsystem performance. In this paper, a new weighting method has also been\nproposed to deal with class imbalance, which is more efficient than existing\nweighting methods. The proposed method is evaluated on three standard emotional\ndatabases.",

The advantage of MPCs is twofold. First, multiple ports\nallow arbitraging the charging among multiple vehicles without requiring the\ndrivers to plug and unplug EVs. Second, the charger's power electronics is not\nsized for the total number of charging ports, enabling cost savings when the\ngrid constraints are bottleneck of the problem. The proposed method can account\nfor different charger typologies, such as slow and fast chargers, and model the\ndrivers' flexibility of plugging and unplugging their EVs.

In this paper, we\nformulate grain segmentation as a pixel-wise two-class (i.e., grain and\nbackground) semantic segmentation task. We develop a deep learning-based\nend-to-end trainable framework named Deep Semantic Grain Segmentation network\n(DSGSN), a data-driven method, and provide a generic solution. As per the\nauthors' knowledge, this is the first work where the deep neural network is\nexplored to solve the grain segmentation problem. Extensive experiments on\nmicroscopic images highlight that our method obtains better segmentation\naccuracy than various segmentation architectures with more parameters.",

In\nthis paper, we present a novel weight update scheme named conditional reverse\nupdate scheme for HNN (Hardware Neural Network) consisting of synaptic devices\nwith highly nonlinear or abrupt conductance update characteristics. We\nformulate a linear optimization method of conductance in synaptic devices to\nreduce the average deviation of weight changes in synaptic devices from the\nweight changes calculated by the Stochastic Gradient Rule (SGD) algorithm. To\nthis end, we introduce a metric called Update Noise (UN) to analyze the update\nnoise dynamics during the training process. We then design a weight update rule\nthat effectively reduces the UN averaged over the whole training process. The\noptimized network in terms of UN under the conditional reverse update scheme\nachieved >90% accuracy on MNIST dataset under highly nonlinear LTP and LTD\nconditions while using inaccurate and infrequent conductance sensing.\nFurthermore, HNN trained with the proposed method showed better accuracy\ncompared to previously reported nonlinear weight update mitigation techniques\nunder the same hardware specifications and device conditions. In addition, the\nproposed method exhibited robustness to temporal variations in conductance\nupdates. We expect that the conditional reverse update scheme can relieve\ndesign requirements in device and circuit engineering and serve as a practical\ntechnique that can be applied to future hardware for HNNs.",

However, current approaches for unsupervised\nobject-centric scene representation are incapable of aggregating information\nfrom multiple observations of a scene. As a result, these \"single-view\" methods\nform their representations of a 3D scene based only on a single 2D observation\n(view). Naturally, this leads to several inaccuracies, with these methods\nfalling victim to single-view spatial ambiguities. To address this, we propose\nThe Multi-View and Multi-Object Network (MulMON) -- a method for learning\naccurate, object-centric representations of multi-object scenes by leveraging\nmultiple views. In order to sidestep the main technical difficulty of the\nmulti-object-multi-view scenario -- maintaining object correspondences across\nviews -- MulMON iteratively updates the latent object representations for a\nscene over multiple views. To ensure that these iterative updates do indeed\naggregate spatial information to form a complete 3D scene understanding, MulMON\nis asked to predict the appearance of the scene from novel viewpoints during\ntraining. Through experiments, we show that MulMON better-resolves spatial\nambiguities than single-view methods -- learning more accurate and disentangled\nobject representations -- and also achieves new functionality in predicting\nobject segmentations for novel viewpoints.",

Deep neural networks (DNN) with\ndeterministic weights cannot express their prediction uncertainties, thereby\npose critical risks for applications where the consequences of mispredictions\nare fatal such as surgical robotics. To address this limitation, Bayesian\ninference of a DNN has gained attention. Using Bayesian inference, not only the\nprediction itself, but the prediction confidence can also be extracted for\nplanning risk-aware actions. However, Bayesian inference of a DNN is\ncomputationally expensive, ill-suited for real-time and/or edge deployment. An\napproximation to Bayesian DNN using Monte Carlo Dropout (MC-Dropout) has shown\nhigh robustness along with low computational complexity. Enhancing the\ncomputational efficiency of the method, we discuss a novel CIM module that can\nperform in-memory probabilistic dropout in addition to in-memory weight-input\nscalar product to support the method. We also propose a compute-reuse\nreformulation of MC-Dropout where each successive instance can utilize the\nproduct-sum computations from the previous iteration. Even more, we discuss how\nthe random instances can be optimally ordered to minimize the overall\nMC-Dropout workload by exploiting combinatorial optimization methods.\nApplication of the proposed CIM-based MC-Dropout execution is discussed for\nMNIST character recognition and visual odometry (VO) of autonomous drones. The\nframework reliably gives prediction confidence amidst non-idealities imposed by\nMC-CIM to a good extent.

Recent advances of deep models trained\nend-to-end with differentiable losses can well-summarize natural text, yet when\napplied to legal domain, they show limited results. In this paper, we propose\nto use reinforcement learning to train current deep summarization models to\nimprove their performance on the legal domain. To this end, we adopt proximal\npolicy optimization methods and introduce novel reward functions that encourage\nthe generation of candidate summaries satisfying both lexical and semantic\ncriteria.

    "title": "A robust collision source method for rank adaptive dynamical low-rank  approximation in radiation therapy",
    "abstract": "Deterministic models for radiation transport describe the density of\nradiation particles moving through a background material. In radiation therapy\napplications, the phase space of this density is composed of energy, spatial\nposition and direction of flight. The resulting six-dimensional phase space\nprohibits fine numerical discretizations, which are essential for the\nconstruction of accurate and reliable treatment plans. In this work, we tackle\nthe high dimensional phase space through a dynamical low-rank approximation of\nthe particle density. Dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) evolves the\nsolution on a low-rank manifold in time. Interpreting the energy variable as a\npseudo-time lets us employ the DLRA framework to represent the solution of the\nradiation transport equation on a low-rank manifold for every energy. Stiff\nscattering terms are treated through an efficient implicit energy\ndiscretization and a rank adaptive integrator is chosen to dynamically adapt\nthe rank in energy. To facilitate the use of boundary conditions and reduce the\noverall rank, the radiation transport equation is split into collided and\nuncollided particles through a collision source method. Uncollided particles\nare described by a directed quadrature set guaranteeing low computational\ncosts, whereas collided particles are represented by a low-rank solution. It\ncan be shown that the presented method is L$^2$-stable under a time step\nrestriction which does not depend on stiff scattering terms. Moreover, the\nimplicit treatment of scattering does not require numerical inversions of\nmatrices. Numerical results for radiation therapy configurations as well as the\nline source benchmark underline the efficiency of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative driving relies on communication among vehicles to create\nsituational awareness. One application of cooperative driving is Cooperative\nAdaptive Cruise Control (CACC) that aims at enhancing highway transportation\nsafety and capacity. Model-based communication (MBC) is a new paradigm with a\nflexible content structure for broadcasting joint vehicle-driver predictive\nbehavioral models. The vehicle's complex dynamics and diverse driving behaviors\nadd complexity to the modeling process. Gaussian process (GP) is a fully\ndata-driven and non-parametric Bayesian modeling approach which can be used as\na modeling component of MBC. The knowledge about the uncertainty is propagated\nthrough predictions by generating local GPs for vehicles and broadcasting their\nhyper-parameters as a model to the neighboring vehicles. In this research\nstudy, GP is used to model each vehicle's speed trajectory, which allows\nvehicles to access the future behavior of their preceding vehicle during\ncommunication loss and/or low-rate communication. Besides, to overcome the\nsafety issues in a vehicle platoon, two operating modes for each vehicle are\nconsidered; free following and emergency braking. This paper presents a\ndiscrete hybrid stochastic model predictive control, which incorporates system\nmodes as well as uncertainties captured by GP models. The proposed control\ndesign approach finds the optimal vehicle speed trajectory with the goal of\nachieving a safe and efficient platoon of vehicles with small inter-vehicle gap\nwhile reducing the reliance of the vehicles on a frequent communication.\nSimulation studies demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controller\nconsidering the aforementioned communication paradigm with low-rate\nintermittent communication.",

    "abstract": "Very often, in the course of uncertainty quantification tasks or data\nanalysis, one has to deal with high-dimensional random variables (RVs). A\nhigh-dimensional RV can be described by its probability density (pdf) and/or by\nthe corresponding probability characteristic functions (pcf), or by a\npolynomial chaos (PCE) or similar expansion. Here the interest is mainly to\ncompute characterisations like the entropy, or relations between two\ndistributions, like their Kullback-Leibler divergence. These are all computed\nfrom the pdf, which is often not available directly, and it is a computational\nchallenge to even represent it in a numerically feasible fashion in case the\ndimension $d$ is even moderately large. In this regard, we propose to represent\nthe density by a high order tensor product, and approximate this in a low-rank\nformat. We show how to go from the pcf or functional representation to the pdf.\nThis allows us to reduce the computational complexity and storage cost from an\nexponential to a linear. The characterisations such as entropy or the\n$f$-divergences need the possibility to compute point-wise functions of the\npdf. This normally rather trivial task becomes more difficult when the pdf is\napproximated in a low-rank tensor format, as the point values are not directly\naccessible any more. The data is considered as an element of a high order\ntensor space. The considered algorithms are independent of the representation\nof the data as a tensor. All that we require is that the data can be considered\nas an element of an associative, commutative algebra with an inner product.\nSuch an algebra is isomorphic to a commutative sub-algebra of the usual matrix\nalgebra, allowing the use of matrix algorithms to accomplish the mentioned\ntasks.",

    "abstract": "Cooperative driving systems, such as platooning, rely on communication and\ninformation exchange to create situational awareness for each agent. Design and\nperformance of control components are therefore tightly coupled with\ncommunication component performance. The information flow between vehicles can\nsignificantly affect the dynamics of a platoon. Therefore, both the performance\nand the stability of a platoon depend not only on the vehicle's controller but\nalso on the information flow Topology (IFT). The IFT can cause limitations for\ncertain platoon properties, i.e., stability and scalability. Cellular\nVehicle-To-Everything (C-V2X) has emerged as one of the main communication\ntechnologies to support connected and automated vehicle applications. As a\nresult of packet loss, wireless channels create random link interruption and\nchanges in network topologies. In this paper, we model the communication links\nbetween vehicles with a first-order Markov model to capture the prevalent time\ncorrelations for each link. These models enable performance evaluation through\nbetter approximation of communication links during system design stages. Our\napproach is to use data from experiments to model the Inter-Packet Gap (IPG)\nusing Markov chains and derive transition probability matrices for consecutive\nIPG states. Training data is collected from high fidelity simulations using\nmodels derived based on empirical data for a variety of different vehicle\ndensities and communication rates.

    "abstract": "In natural language processing, most models try to learn semantic\nrepresentations merely from texts. The learned representations encode the\ndistributional semantics but fail to connect to any knowledge about the\nphysical world. In contrast, humans learn language by grounding concepts in\nperception and action and the brain encodes grounded semantics for cognition.\nInspired by this notion and recent work in vision-language learning, we design\na two-stream model for grounding language learning in vision. The model\nincludes a VGG-based visual stream and a Bert-based language stream. The two\nstreams merge into a joint representational space. Through cross-modal\ncontrastive learning, the model first learns to align visual and language\nrepresentations with the MS COCO dataset. The model further learns to retrieve\nvisual objects with language queries through a cross-modal attention module and\nto infer the visual relations between the retrieved objects through a bilinear\noperator with the Visual Genome dataset. After training, the language stream of\nthis model is a stand-alone language model capable of embedding concepts in a\nvisually grounded semantic space. This semantic space manifests principal\ndimensions explainable with human intuition and neurobiological knowledge. Word\nembeddings in this semantic space are predictive of human-defined norms of\nsemantic features and are segregated into perceptually distinctive clusters.\nFurthermore, the visually grounded language model also enables compositional\nlanguage understanding based on visual knowledge and multimodal image search\nwith queries based on images, texts, or their combinations.",

The proposed model is adaptable to a large variety of garments and\nchanging topologies, without need of being retrained. Such simulations are\ntypically carried out by physics engines that require manual human expertise\nand are subjectto computationally intensive computations. PhysXNet, by\ncontrast, is a fully differentiable deep network that at inference is able to\nestimate the geometry of dense cloth meshes in a matter of milliseconds, and\nthus, can be readily deployed as a layer of a larger deep learning\narchitecture. This efficiency is achieved thanks to the specific\nparameterization of the clothes we consider, based on 3D UV maps encoding\nspatial garment displacements. The problem is then formulated as a mapping\nbetween the human kinematics space (represented also by 3D UV maps of the\nundressed body mesh) into the clothes displacement UV maps, which we learn\nusing a conditional GAN with a discriminator that enforces feasible\ndeformations. We train simultaneously our model for three garment templates,\ntops, bottoms and dresses for which we simulate deformations under 50 different\nhuman actions. Nevertheless, the UV map representation we consider allows\nencapsulating many different cloth topologies, and at test we can simulate\ngarments even if we did not specifically train for them.

Our\nfindings indicate that not only do these users share a high volume of\nlegitimate phishing URLs, but these reports contain more information regarding\nthe phishing websites (which can expedite the process of identifying and\nremoving these threats), when compared to two popular open-source phishing\nfeeds: PhishTank and OpenPhish. We also notice that the reported websites had\nvery little overlap with the URLs existing in the other feeds, and also\nremained active for longer periods of time. But despite having these\nattributes, we found that these reports have very low interaction from other\nTwitter users, especially from the domains and organizations targeted by the\nreported URLs. Moreover, nearly 31% of these URLs were still active even after\na week of them being reported, with 27% of them being detected by very few\nanti-phishing tools, suggesting that a large majority of these reports remain\nundiscovered, despite the majority of the follower base of these accounts being\nsecurity focused users. Thus, this work highlights the effectiveness of the\nreports, and the benefits of using them as an open source knowledge base for\nidentifying new phishing websites.",

We characterize the eye tracking signal quality\nof the device in terms of spatial accuracy, spatial precision, temporal\nprecision, linearity, and crosstalk. We are the first to measure linearity and\ncrosstalk in the HoloLens 2. Most notably, our evaluation of spatial accuracy\nreveals that the eye movement data in our dataset appears to be largely\nuncalibrated, possibly due to the experimental conditions in which we collected\nour data. We also observe that recalibrating the data using our own\nrecalibration task produces notably better eye tracking signal quality.

The Koopman\noperator is a linear but infinite-dimensional operator that governs the\nevolution of observables, and is beneficial when employed in the analysis of\ndynamics. The Koopman matrix corresponds to an approximation of the Koopman\noperator, requiring a specific dictionary to represent the operator. In this\nstudy, an alternative approach for evaluating the Koopman matrix for stochastic\ndifferential equations has been proposed. Using the system equations the\nKoopman matrix can be directly derived without any sampling. Hence, this\napproach is complementary to a data-driven approach provided a prior knowledge\nof the system equations is available. The proposed method comprises\ncombinatorics, an approximation of the resolvent, and extrapolations.\nComparisons with the EDMD have also been demonstrated considering a noisy van\nder Pol system. The proposed method yields reasonable results even in cases\nwherein the EDMD exhibits a slow convergence behavior.",

    "abstract": "Serverless computing has seen rapid growth due to the ease-of-use and\ncost-efficiency it provides. However, function scheduling, a critical component\nof serverless systems, has been overlooked. In this paper, we take a\nfirst-principles approach toward designing a scheduler that caters to the\nunique characteristics of serverless functions as seen in real-world\ndeployments. We first create a taxonomy of scheduling policies along three\ndimensions. Next, we use simulation to explore the scheduling policy space for\nthe function characteristics in a 14-day trace of Azure functions and conclude\nthat frequently used features such as late binding and random load balancing\nare sub-optimal for common execution time distributions and load ranges. We use\nthese insights to design Hermes, a scheduler for serverless functions with\nthree key characteristics. First, to avoid head-of-line blocking due to high\nfunction execution time variability, Hermes uses a combination of early binding\nand processor sharing for scheduling at individual worker machines. Second,\nHermes uses a hybrid load balancing approach that improves consolidation at low\nload while employing least-loaded balancing at high load to retain high\nperformance. Third, Hermes is both load and locality-aware, reducing the number\nof cold starts compared to pure load-based policies. We implement Hermes for\nApache OpenWhisk and demonstrate that, for the case of the function patterns\nobserved both in the Azure and in other real-world traces, it achieves up to\n85% lower function slowdown and 60% higher throughput compared to existing\npolicies.",

    "abstract": "The echo state network (ESN) is a powerful and efficient tool for displaying\ndynamic data. However, many existing ESNs have limitations for properly\nmodeling high-dimensional data. The most important limitation of these networks\nis the high memory consumption due to their reservoir structure, which has\nprevented the increase of reservoir units and the maximum use of special\ncapabilities of this type of network. One way to solve this problem is to use\nquaternion algebra. Because quaternions have four different dimensions,\nhigh-dimensional data are easily represented and, using Hamilton\nmultiplication, with fewer parameters than real numbers, make external\nrelations between the multidimensional features easier. In addition to the\nmemory problem in the ESN network, the linear output of the ESN network poses\nan indescribable limit to its processing capacity, as it cannot effectively\nutilize higher-order statistics of features provided by the nonlinear dynamics\nof reservoir neurons. In this research, a new structure based on ESN is\npresented, in which quaternion algebra is used to compress the network data\nwith the simple split function, and the output linear combiner is replaced by a\nmultidimensional bilinear filter. This filter will be used for nonlinear\ncalculations of the output layer of the ESN. In addition, the two-dimensional\nprincipal component analysis technique is used to reduce the number of data\ntransferred to the bilinear filter. In this study, the coefficients and the\nweights of the quaternion nonlinear ESN (QNESN) are optimized using the genetic\nalgorithm. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model compared\nto the previous methods, experiments for speech emotion recognition have been\nperformed on EMODB, SAVEE, and IEMOCAP speech emotional datasets.

Next, this\napproximation factor significantly improves upon the O(log m/log log\nm)-approximation in (Ibrahimpur and Swamy, FOCS 2020) for StochNormLB, and is a\nconsequence of a more-general black-box reduction that we present, showing that\na $\\gamma(d)$-approximation for d-dimensional vector scheduling with respect to\nthe lower bound lb yields a simultaneous $\\gamma(\\log m)$-approximation for\nStochNormLB with all monotone, symmetric norms.",

After the success\nof the pioneer work PointNet, deep learning-based methods have been\nincreasingly applied to various tasks, including 3D point cloud segmentation\nand 3D object classification. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D point cloud\nlearning network, referred to as Dynamic Point Feature Aggregation Network\n(DPFA-Net), by selectively performing the neighborhood feature aggregation with\ndynamic pooling and an attention mechanism. DPFA-Net has two variants for\nsemantic segmentation and classification of 3D point clouds. As the core module\nof the DPFA-Net, we propose a Feature Aggregation layer, in which features of\nthe dynamic neighborhood of each point are aggregated via a self-attention\nmechanism. In contrast to other segmentation models, which aggregate features\nfrom fixed neighborhoods, our approach can aggregate features from different\nneighbors in different layers providing a more selective and broader view to\nthe query points, and focusing more on the relevant features in a local\nneighborhood. In addition, to further improve the performance of the proposed\nsemantic segmentation model, we present two novel approaches, namely Two-Stage\nBF-Net and BF-Regularization to exploit the background-foreground information.\nExperimental results show that the proposed DPFA-Net achieves the\nstate-of-the-art overall accuracy score for semantic segmentation on the S3DIS\ndataset, and provides a consistently satisfactory performance across different\ntasks of semantic segmentation, part segmentation, and 3D object\nclassification.

There have been several\nattempts to create collections of literary texts with annotation of literary\nelements like the author's speech, characters, events, scenes etc. However,\nthey resulted in small collections and standalone rules for annotation. The\npresent article describes an experiment on lexical annotation of text worlds in\na literary work and quantitative methods of their comparison. The experiment\nshows that for a well-agreed tag assignment annotation rules should be set much\nmore strictly. However, if borders between text worlds and other elements are\nthe result of a subjective interpretation, they should be modeled as fuzzy\nentities.",

    "title": "Sign Language Translation with Hierarchical Spatio-TemporalGraph Neural  Network",
    "abstract": "Sign language translation (SLT), which generates text in a spoken language\nfrom visual content in a sign language, is important to assist the\nhard-of-hearing community for their communications. Inspired by neural machine\ntranslation (NMT), most existing SLT studies adopted a general sequence to\nsequence learning strategy. However, SLT is significantly different from\ngeneral NMT tasks since sign languages convey messages through multiple\nvisual-manual aspects. Therefore, in this paper, these unique characteristics\nof sign languages are formulated as hierarchical spatio-temporal graph\nrepresentations, including high-level and fine-level graphs of which a vertex\ncharacterizes a specified body part and an edge represents their interactions.\nParticularly, high-level graphs represent the patterns in the regions such as\nhands and face, and fine-level graphs consider the joints of hands and\nlandmarks of facial regions. To learn these graph patterns, a novel deep\nlearning architecture, namely hierarchical spatio-temporal graph neural network\n(HST-GNN), is proposed. Graph convolutions and graph self-attentions with\nneighborhood context are proposed to characterize both the local and the global\ngraph properties. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrated the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "An effective and efficient encoding of the source code of a computer program\nis critical to the success of sequence-to-sequence deep neural network models\nfor tasks in computer program comprehension, such as automated code\nsummarization and documentation. A significant challenge is to find a\nsequential representation that captures the structural/syntactic information in\na computer program and facilitates the training of the learning models.\nIn this paper, we propose to use the Pr\\\"ufer sequence of the Abstract Syntax\nTree (AST) of a computer program to design a sequential representation scheme\nthat preserves the structural information in an AST. Our representation makes\nit possible to develop deep-learning models in which signals carried by lexical\ntokens in the training examples can be exploited automatically and selectively\nbased on their syntactic role and importance. Unlike other recently-proposed\napproaches, our representation is concise and lossless in terms of the\nstructural information of the AST. Empirical studies on real-world benchmark\ndatasets, using a sequence-to-sequence learning model we designed for code\nsummarization, show that our Pr\\\"ufer-sequence-based representation is indeed\nhighly effective and efficient, outperforming significantly all the\nrecently-proposed deep-learning models we used as the baseline models.",

    "abstract": "There were fierce debates on whether the non-linear embedding propagation of\nGCNs is appropriate to GCN-based recommender systems. It was recently found\nthat the linear embedding propagation shows better accuracy than the non-linear\nembedding propagation. Since this phenomenon was discovered especially in\nrecommender systems, it is required that we carefully analyze the linearity and\nnon-linearity issue. In this work, therefore, we revisit the issues of i) which\nof the linear or non-linear propagation is better and ii) which factors of\nusers/items decide the linearity/non-linearity of the embedding propagation. We\npropose a novel Hybrid Method of Linear and non-linEar collaborative filTering\nmethod (HMLET, pronounced as Hamlet). In our design, there exist both linear\nand non-linear propagation steps, when processing each user or item node, and\nour gating module chooses one of them, which results in a hybrid model of the\nlinear and non-linear GCN-based collaborative filtering (CF). The proposed\nmodel yields the best accuracy in three public benchmark datasets. Moreover, we\nclassify users/items into the following three classes depending on our gating\nmodules' selections: Full-Non-Linearity (FNL), Partial-Non-Linearity (PNL), and\nFull-Linearity (FL). We found that there exist strong correlations between\nnodes' centrality and their class membership, i.e., important user/item nodes\nexhibit more preferences towards the non-linearity during the propagation\nsteps. To our knowledge, we are the first who designs a hybrid method and\nreports the correlation between the graph centrality and the\nlinearity/non-linearity of nodes.

The maps were evaluated in a graphical perception\nstudy featuring the comparison of SDG (Sustainable Development Goal) data for\nseveral European countries.

We then\nexamined two commonly used auxiliary losses in inpainting and use \\ac{ALA} to\nadapt their parameters.

In this paper, a novel color mapping algorithm is\nfirst proposed by introducing a new concept of weighted histogram averaging\n(WHA).

Although some\nclassic controllers like model predictive control (MPC) and fuzzy control\nachieve a certain measure of success, most of them require precise global\ninformation which is not accessible in harsh environments. On the other hand,\nsome reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches adopt the leader-follower\nstructure to organize different agents' behaviors, which sacrifices the\ncollaboration between agents thus suffering from bottlenecks in maneuverability\nand robustness. In this paper, we propose a distributed formation and obstacle\navoidance method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Agents in\nour system only utilize local and relative information to make decisions and\ncontrol themselves distributively. Agent in the multi-agent system will\nreorganize themselves into a new topology quickly in case that any of them is\ndisconnected. Our method achieves better performance regarding formation error,\nformation convergence rate and on-par success rate of obstacle avoidance\ncompared with baselines (both classic control methods and another RL-based\nmethod). The feasibility of our method is verified by both simulation and\nhardware implementation with Ackermann-steering vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance for\nsemi-supervised node classification on graphs, as a result of their ability to\nexploit node features and topological information simultaneously.

Hence, when the topology is\nnon-informative for label prediction, ordinary GNNs may work significantly\nworse than simply applying multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) on each node. To\ntackle the above problem, we propose a new $p$-Laplacian based GNN model,\ntermed as $^p$GNN, whose message passing mechanism is derived from a discrete\nregularization framework and could be theoretically explained as an\napproximation of a polynomial graph filter defined on the spectral domain of\n$p$-Laplacians.

    "title": "On Optimizing Rate Splitting in Laser-based Optical Wireless Networks",
    "abstract": "Optical wireless communication (OWC) is a promising technology that has the\npotential to provide Tb/s aggregate rates. In this paper, interference\nmanagement is studied in a Laser-based optical wireless network where\nvertical-cavity surface-emitting (VCSEL) lasers are used for data transmission.\nIn particular, rate splitting (RS) and hierarchical rate splitting (HRS) are\nproposed to align multi-user interference, while maximizing the multiplexing\ngain of the network. Basically, RS serves multiple users simultaneously by\nsplitting a message of a user into common and private messages, each message\nwith a certain level of power, while on the other side users decode their\nmessages following a specific methodology. The performance of the conventional\nRS scheme is limited in high density wireless networks. Therefore, the HRS\nscheme is developed aiming to achieve high rates where users are divided into\nmultiple groups, and a new message called outer common message is used for\nmanaging inter-group interference. We formulate an optimization problem that\naddresses power allocation among the messages of the HRS scheme to further\nenhance the performance of the network. The results show that the proposed\napproach provides high achievable rates compared with the conventional RS and\nHRS schemes in different scenarios.",

    "title": "Towards Privacy-Preserving Affect Recognition: A Two-Level Deep Learning  Architecture",
    "abstract": "Automatically understanding and recognising human affective states using\nimages and computer vision can improve human-computer and human-robot\ninteraction. However, privacy has become an issue of great concern, as the\nidentities of people used to train affective models can be exposed in the\nprocess. For instance, malicious individuals could exploit images from users\nand assume their identities. In addition, affect recognition using images can\nlead to discriminatory and algorithmic bias, as certain information such as\nrace, gender, and age could be assumed based on facial features. Possible\nsolutions to protect the privacy of users and avoid misuse of their identities\nare to: (1) extract anonymised facial features, namely action units (AU) from a\ndatabase of images, discard the images and use AUs for processing and training,\nand (2) federated learning (FL) i.e. process raw images in users' local\nmachines (local processing) and send the locally trained models to the main\nprocessing machine for aggregation (central processing). In this paper, we\npropose a two-level deep learning architecture for affect recognition that uses\nAUs in level 1 and FL in level 2 to protect users' identities. The architecture\nconsists of recurrent neural networks to capture the temporal relationships\namongst the features and predict valence and arousal affective states. In our\nexperiments, we evaluate the performance of our privacy-preserving architecture\nusing different variations of recurrent neural networks on RECOLA, a\ncomprehensive multimodal affective database. Our results show state-of-the-art\nperformance of $0.426$ for valence and $0.401$ for arousal using the\nConcordance Correlation Coefficient evaluation metric, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of developing models for affect recognition that are both accurate\nand ensure privacy.",

Identifying the object\nregions involves utilizing pretrained models to perform object detection,\nobject segmentation and/or object pose estimation. However, it is infeasible in\npractice due to the following reasons: 1) The object categories of pretrained\nmodels' training dataset may not cover all the object categories exhaustively\nneeded for general computer vision tasks, 2) The domain gap between pretrained\nmodels' training dataset and target task's dataset may differ and negatively\nimpact the performance, 3) The bias and variance present in pretrained models\nmay leak into target task leading to an inadvertently biased target model. To\novercome these downsides, we propose to utilize the common rationale that a\nsequence of video frames capture a set of common objects and interactions\nbetween them, thus a notion of co-segmentation between the video frame features\nmay equip the model with the ability to automatically focus on salient regions\nand improve underlying task's performance in an end-to-end manner.

Existing methods usually\nmodel the user behavior sequence based on the transition-based methods like\nMarkov Chain. However, these methods also implicitly assume that the users are\nindependent of each other without considering the influence between users. In\nfact, this influence plays an important role in sequence recommendation since\nthe behavior of a user is easily affected by others. Therefore, it is desirable\nto aggregate both user behaviors and the influence between users, which are\nevolved temporally and involved in the heterogeneous graph of users and items.\nIn this paper, we incorporate dynamic user-item heterogeneous graphs to propose\na novel sequential recommendation framework. As a result, the historical\nbehaviors as well as the influence between users can be taken into\nconsideration. To achieve this, we firstly formalize sequential recommendation\nas a problem to estimate conditional probability given temporal dynamic\nheterogeneous graphs and user behavior sequences. After that, we exploit the\nconditional random field to aggregate the heterogeneous graphs and user\nbehaviors for probability estimation, and employ the pseudo-likelihood approach\nto derive a tractable objective function. Finally, we provide scalable and\nflexible implementations of the proposed framework.

However, it has been shown\nthat each model update carries sensitive information about the user's dataset\n(e.g., gradient inversion attacks).\nThe state-of-the-art implementations of federated learning protect these\nmodel updates by leveraging secure aggregation: A cryptographic protocol that\nsecurely computes the aggregation of the model updates of the users. Secure\naggregation is pivotal to protect users' privacy since it hinders the server\nfrom learning the value and the source of the individual model updates provided\nby the users, preventing inference and data attribution attacks.\nIn this work, we show that a malicious server can easily elude secure\naggregation as if the latter were not in place.

    "abstract": "As a basic component of SE(3)-equivariant deep feature learning, steerable\nconvolution has recently demonstrated its advantages for 3D semantic analysis.\nThe advantages are, however, brought by expensive computations on dense,\nvolumetric data, which prevent its practical use for efficient processing of 3D\ndata that are inherently sparse. In this paper, we propose a novel design of\nSparse Steerable Convolution (SS-Conv) to address the shortcoming; SS-Conv\ngreatly accelerates steerable convolution with sparse tensors, while strictly\npreserving the property of SE(3)-equivariance. Based on SS-Conv, we propose a\ngeneral pipeline for precise estimation of object poses, wherein a key design\nis a Feature-Steering module that takes the full advantage of\nSE(3)-equivariance and is able to conduct an efficient pose refinement. To\nverify our designs, we conduct thorough experiments on three tasks of 3D object\nsemantic analysis, including instance-level 6D pose estimation, category-level\n6D pose and size estimation, and category-level 6D pose tracking. Our proposed\npipeline based on SS-Conv outperforms existing methods on almost all the\nmetrics evaluated by the three tasks. Ablation studies also show the\nsuperiority of our SS-Conv over alternative convolutions in terms of both\naccuracy and efficiency.

With qLST, we\ntrain a neural network that learns to traverse in the latent space of a\nvariational autoencoder trained on a large university hospital dataset with\nover 800,000 ECGs annotated for 28 diseases. We demonstrate through experiments\nthat we can explain different black box classifiers by generating ECGs through\nthese traversals.",

    "abstract": "The unprecedented surge of data volume in wireless networks empowered with\nartificial intelligence (AI) opens up new horizons for providing ubiquitous\ndata-driven intelligent services. Traditional cloud-centric machine learning\n(ML)-based services are implemented by collecting datasets and training models\ncentrally. However, this conventional training technique encompasses two\nchallenges: (i) high communication and energy cost due to increased data\ncommunication, (ii) threatened data privacy by allowing untrusted parties to\nutilise this information. Recently, in light of these limitations, a new\nemerging technique, coined as federated learning (FL), arose to bring ML to the\nedge of wireless networks. FL can extract the benefits of data silos by\ntraining a global model in a distributed manner, orchestrated by the FL server.\nFL exploits both decentralised datasets and computing resources of\nparticipating clients to develop a generalised ML model without compromising\ndata privacy. In this article, we introduce a comprehensive survey of the\nfundamentals and enabling technologies of FL. Moreover, an extensive study is\npresented detailing various applications of FL in wireless networks and\nhighlighting their challenges and limitations. The efficacy of FL is further\nexplored with emerging prospective beyond fifth generation (B5G) and sixth\ngeneration (6G) communication systems. The purpose of this survey is to provide\nan overview of the state-of-the-art of FL applications in key wireless\ntechnologies that will serve as a foundation to establish a firm understanding\nof the topic.

    "abstract": "In reinforcement learning (RL), an agent must explore an initially unknown\nenvironment in order to learn a desired behaviour. When RL agents are deployed\nin real world environments, safety is of primary concern. Constrained Markov\ndecision processes (CMDPs) can provide long-term safety constraints; however,\nthe agent may violate the constraints in an effort to explore its environment.\nThis paper proposes a model-based RL algorithm called Explicit Explore,\nExploit, or Escape ($E^{4}$), which extends the Explicit Explore or Exploit\n($E^{3}$) algorithm to a robust CMDP setting. $E^4$ explicitly separates\nexploitation, exploration, and escape CMDPs, allowing targeted policies for\npolicy improvement across known states, discovery of unknown states, as well as\nsafe return to known states. $E^4$ robustly optimises these policies on the\nworst-case CMDP from a set of CMDP models consistent with the empirical\nobservations of the deployment environment. Theoretical results show that $E^4$\nfinds a near-optimal constraint-satisfying policy in polynomial time whilst\nsatisfying safety constraints throughout the learning process.

In\nthis study, we cast the problem of emotion conversion as a spoken language\ntranslation task.

First,\nwe modify the speech content by translating the content units to a target\nemotion, and then predict the prosodic features based on these units. Finally,\nthe speech waveform is generated by feeding the predicted representations into\na neural vocoder.

    "abstract": "The pivotal storage density win achieved by solid-state devices over magnetic\ndevices in 2015 is a result of multiple innovations in physics, architecture,\nand signal processing. One of the most important innovations in that regard is\nenabling the storage of more than one bit per cell in the Flash device, i.e.,\nhaving more than two charge levels per cell. Constrained coding is used in\nFlash devices to increase reliability via mitigating inter-cell interference\nthat stems from charge propagation among cells. Recently, capacity-achieving\nconstrained codes were introduced to serve that purpose in modern Flash\ndevices, which have more than two levels per cell. While these codes result in\nminimal redundancy via exploiting the underlying physics, they result in\nnon-negligible complexity increase and access speed limitation since pages\ncannot be read separately. In this paper, we suggest new constrained coding\nschemes that have low-complexity and preserve the desirable high access speed\nin modern Flash devices. The idea is to eliminate error-prone patterns by\ncoding data only on the left-most page while leaving data on all the remaining\npages uncoded. Our coding schemes work for any number of levels per cell, offer\nsystematic encoding and decoding, and are capacity-approaching. Since the\nproposed schemes enable the separation of pages, we refer to them as\nread-and-run (RR) constrained coding schemes as opposed to schemes adopting\nread-and-wait for other pages. We analyze the new RR coding schemes and discuss\ntheir impact on the probability of occurrence of different charge levels. We\nalso demonstrate the performance improvement achieved via RR coding on a\npractical triple-level cell Flash device.",

We study queueing networks that operate under the Max-Weight\nscheduling policy, for the case where some queues receive heavy-tailed traffic,\nwhile some other queues receive light-tailed traffic. We say that a queue is\n$delay$ $stable$ if its expected size (and hence its expected delay) is\nuniformly bounded over time. It is well-known that a queue with heavy-tailed\narrivals is always delay unstable. Queues with light-tailed arrivals are often\ndelay stable, as long as their arrival rate does not exceed the service\ncapacity, but can also become delay unstable because of resource-sharing with\nother delay unstable queues.\nWithin this context, and for any given \"tail exponents\" of the input traffic,\nwe develop tight (necessary and sufficient) conditions under which a queue with\nlight-tailed arrivals is robustly delay stable, in terms of $jumping$ $fluid$\n(JF) models-an extension of traditional fluid models that allows for jumps\nalong coordinates associated with heavy-tailed flows. In particular, we show\nthat a queue is robustly delay stable if and only if all JF trajectories in a\ncertain class, and whose number of jumps is limited by a certain \"budget,\" keep\nthe queue of interest at zero. This result elucidates the precise mechanism\nthat leads to delay instability, through a coordination of multiple abnormally\nlarge arrivals at possibly different times and queues. Moreover, it shows that\ntraditional fluid models are intrinsically unable to provide tight conditions\nfor delay stability and settles an earlier open question on the sufficiency of\na particular fluid-based criterion. We also explore the power of Lyapunov\nfunctions in the study of robust delay stability.",

While\nthe subject is well-researched in the 2D regime, it is lagging behind in the 3D\nregime, i.e. attacking a classifying network that works on 3D point-clouds or\nmeshes and, for example, classifies the pose of people's 3D scans.

    "abstract": "Untrimmed videos on social media or those captured by robots and surveillance\ncameras are of varied aspect ratios. However, 3D CNNs require a square-shaped\nvideo whose spatial dimension is smaller than the original one. Random or\ncenter-cropping techniques in use may leave out the video's subject altogether.\nTo address this, we propose an unsupervised video cropping approach by shaping\nthis as a retargeting and video-to-video synthesis problem. The synthesized\nvideo maintains 1:1 aspect ratio, smaller in size and is targeted at the\nvideo-subject throughout the whole duration. First, action localization on the\nindividual frames is performed by identifying patches with homogeneous motion\npatterns and a single salient patch is pin-pointed. To avoid viewpoint jitters\nand flickering artifacts, any inter-frame scale or position changes among the\npatches is performed gradually over time. This issue is addressed with a\npoly-Bezier fitting in 3D space that passes through some chosen pivot\ntimestamps and its shape is influenced by in-between control timestamps. To\ncorroborate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we evaluate the video\nclassification task by comparing our dynamic cropping with static random on\nthree benchmark datasets: UCF-101, HMDB-51 and ActivityNet v1.3. The clip\naccuracy and top-1 accuracy for video classification after our cropping,\noutperform 3D CNN performances for same-sized inputs with random crop;\nsometimes even surpassing larger random crop sizes.",

    "abstract": "A flexible treatment for gas- and aerosol-phase chemical processes has been\ndeveloped for models of diverse scale, from box models up to global models. At\nthe core of this novel framework is an \"abstracted aerosol representation\" that\nallows a given chemical mechanism to be solved in atmospheric models with\ndifferent aerosol representations (e.g., sectional, modal, or\nparticle-resolved). This is accomplished by treating aerosols as a collection\nof condensed phases that are implemented according to the aerosol\nrepresentation of the host model. The framework also allows multiple chemical\nprocesses (e.g., gas- and aerosol-phase chemical reactions, emissions,\ndeposition, photolysis, and mass-transfer) to be solved simultaneously as a\nsingle system. The flexibility of the model is achieved by (1) using an\nobject-oriented design that facilitates extensibility to new types of chemical\nprocesses and to new ways of representing aerosol systems; (2) runtime model\nconfiguration using JSON input files that permits making changes to any part of\nthe chemical mechanism without recompiling the model; this widely used,\nhuman-readable format allows entire gas- and aerosol-phase chemical mechanisms\nto be described with as much complexity as necessary; and (3) automated\ncomprehensive testing that ensures stability of the code as new functionality\nis introduced. Together, these design choices enable users to build a\ncustomized multiphase mechanism, without having to handle pre-processors,\nsolvers or compilers. This new treatment compiles as a stand-alone library and\nhas been deployed in the particle-resolved PartMC model and in the MONARCH\nchemical weather prediction system for use at regional and global scales.\nResults from the initial deployment will be discussed, along with future\nextension to more complex gas-aerosol systems, and the integration of GPU-based\nsolvers.",

However, the applicability of such deep neural networks are limited\nby the requirement of large amounts of training data. In order to cope with\nlimited training data for a target task, transfer learning for SAR modeling has\nbeen recently adopted to leverage information from data of related tasks. In\nthis work, in contrast to the popular parameter-based transfer learning such as\npretraining, we develop novel deep transfer learning methods TAc and TAc-fc to\nleverage source domain data and transfer useful information to the target\ndomain. TAc learns to generate effective molecular features that can generalize\nwell from one domain to another, and increase the classification performance in\nthe target domain. Additionally, TAc-fc extends TAc by incorporating novel\ncomponents to selectively learn feature-wise and compound-wise transferability.\nWe used the bioassay screening data from PubChem, and identified 120 pairs of\nbioassays such that the active compounds in each pair are more similar to each\nother compared to its inactive compounds. Overall, TAc achieves the best\nperformance with average ROC-AUC of 0.801; it significantly improves ROC-AUC of\n83% target tasks with average task-wise performance improvement of 7.102%,\ncompared to the best baseline FCN-dmpna (DT). Our experiments clearly\ndemonstrate that TAc achieves significant improvement over all baselines across\na large number of target tasks. Furthermore, although TAc-fc achieves slightly\nworse ROC-AUC on average compared to TAc (0.798 vs 0.801), TAc-fc still\nachieves the best performance on more tasks in terms of PR-AUC and F1 compared\nto other methods.",

In such multi-robot applications, the\nuser-defined objectives of the mission can be cast as a general optimization\nproblem, without explicit guidelines of the subtasks per different robot. Owing\nto the unknown environment, unknown robot dynamics, sensor nonlinearities,\netc., the analytic form of the optimization cost function is not available a\npriori. Therefore, standard gradient-descent-like algorithms are not applicable\nto these problems. To tackle this, we introduce a new algorithm that carefully\ndesigns each robot's subcost function, the optimization of which can accomplish\nthe overall team objective. Upon this transformation, we propose a distributed\nmethodology based on the cognitive-based adaptive optimization (CAO) algorithm,\nthat is able to approximate the evolution of each robot's cost function and to\nadequately optimize its decision variables (robot actions). The latter can be\nachieved by online learning only the problem-specific characteristics that\naffect the accomplishment of mission objectives. The overall, low-complexity\nalgorithm can straightforwardly incorporate any kind of operational constraint,\nis fault tolerant, and can appropriately tackle time-varying cost functions. A\ncornerstone of this approach is that it shares the same convergence\ncharacteristics as those of block coordinate descent algorithms. The proposed\nalgorithm is evaluated in three heterogeneous simulation set-ups under multiple\nscenarios, against both general-purpose and problem-specific algorithms.

In addition,\nthere is nonlinear time-varying perturbation which may be persistent. We first\npropose several mild regularity assumptions, under which the total variations\nof the system matrix and its abscissa are well-defined over arbitrary time\ninterval. We then state our main result of the work, which requires the\ncombined assessment of the total variation of the system matrix, the measure\nwhen the system is not sufficiently \"stable\" and the estimate of the\nperturbation to be upper bounded by a function affine in time. When this\ncondition is met, we prove that the neighborhood of the origin, whose size\ndepends on the magnitude of the perturbation, is uniformly globally\nexponentially stable for the system.

This could help public health informatics studies produce\nmore timely results during crises, with a reduced risk of misleading results.\nMethods: Emotion and sentiment classifiers were applied to COVID-19 data\nbefore and after debiasing the classifiers using unsupervised contrastive\nclustering. Contrastive clustering approximates the degree to which tokens\nexhibit a causal versus correlational relationship with emotion or sentiment,\nby contrasting the tokens' relative salience to topics versus emotions or\nsentiments.\nResults: Contrastive clustering distinguishes correlation from causation for\ntokens with an F1 score of 0.753. Masking bias prone tokens from the classifier\ninput decreases the classifier's overall F1 score by 0.02 (anger) and 0.033\n(negative sentiment), but improves the F1 score for sentences annotated as bias\nprone by 0.155 (anger) and 0.103 (negative sentiment).

    "title": "Mean-based Best Arm Identification in Stochastic Bandits under Reward  Contamination",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of best arm identification in\n$\\textit{contaminated}$ stochastic multi-arm bandits. In this setting, the\nrewards obtained from any arm are replaced by samples from an adversarial model\nwith probability $\\varepsilon$. A fixed confidence (infinite-horizon) setting\nis considered, where the goal of the learner is to identify the arm with the\nlargest mean. Owing to the adversarial contamination of the rewards, each arm's\nmean is only partially identifiable. This paper proposes two algorithms, a\ngap-based algorithm and one based on the successive elimination, for best arm\nidentification in sub-Gaussian bandits. These algorithms involve mean estimates\nthat achieve the optimal error guarantee on the deviation of the true mean from\nthe estimate asymptotically. Furthermore, these algorithms asymptotically\nachieve the optimal sample complexity. Specifically, for the gap-based\nalgorithm, the sample complexity is asymptotically optimal up to constant\nfactors, while for the successive elimination-based algorithm, it is optimal up\nto logarithmic factors. Finally, numerical experiments are provided to\nillustrate the gains of the algorithms compared to the existing baselines.",

    "abstract": "Electrical load prediction has become an integral part of power system\noperation. Deep learning models have found popularity for this purpose.\nHowever, to achieve a desired prediction accuracy, they require huge amounts of\ndata for training. Sharing electricity consumption data of individual\nhouseholds for load prediction may compromise user privacy and can be expensive\nin terms of communication resources. Therefore, edge computing methods, such as\nfederated learning, are gaining more importance for this purpose. These methods\ncan take advantage of the data without centrally storing it. This paper\nevaluates the performance of federated learning for short-term forecasting of\nindividual house loads as well as the aggregate load. It discusses the\nadvantages and disadvantages of this method by comparing it to centralized and\nlocal learning schemes. Moreover, a new client clustering method is proposed to\nreduce the convergence time of federated learning. The results show that\nfederated learning has a good performance with a minimum root mean squared\nerror (RMSE) of 0.117kWh for individual load forecasting.",

However, Cell-Free mMIMO systems face multiple practical\nchallenges such as the high complexity and power consumption of the APs' analog\nfront-ends. Motivated by prior works, we address these issues by considering a\nlow complexity hybrid beamforming framework at the APs in which each AP has a\nlimited number of RF-chains to reduce power consumption, and the analog\ncombiner is designed only using the large-scale statistics of the channel to\nreduce the system's complexity.

Current operational forecasting\nmodels are based on physics and use supercomputers to simulate the atmosphere\nto make forecasts hours and days in advance. Better physics-based forecasts\nrequire improvements in the models themselves, which can be a substantial\nscientific challenge, as well as improvements in the underlying resolution,\nwhich can be computationally prohibitive. An emerging class of weather models\nbased on neural networks represents a paradigm shift in weather forecasting:\nthe models learn the required transformations from data instead of relying on\nhand-coded physics and are computationally efficient. For neural models,\nhowever, each additional hour of lead time poses a substantial challenge as it\nrequires capturing ever larger spatial contexts and increases the uncertainty\nof the prediction. In this work, we present a neural network that is capable of\nlarge-scale precipitation forecasting up to twelve hours ahead and, starting\nfrom the same atmospheric state, the model achieves greater skill than the\nstate-of-the-art physics-based models HRRR and HREF that currently operate in\nthe Continental United States.

    "abstract": "Submodular function minimization (SFM) and matroid intersection are\nfundamental discrete optimization problems with applications in many fields. It\nis well known that both of these can be solved making $\\mathrm{poly}(N)$\nqueries to a relevant oracle (evaluation oracle for SFM and rank oracle for\nmatroid intersection), where $N$ denotes the universe size. However, all known\npolynomial query algorithms are highly adaptive, requiring at least $N$ rounds\nof querying the oracle. A natural question is whether these can be efficiently\nsolved in a highly parallel manner, namely, with $\\mathrm{poly}(N)$ queries\nusing only poly-logarithmic rounds of adaptivity.\nAn important step towards understanding the adaptivity needed for efficient\nparallel SFM was taken recently in the work of Balkanski and Singer who showed\nthat any SFM algorithm making $\\mathrm{poly}(N)$ queries necessarily requires\n$\\Omega(\\log N/\\log \\log N)$ rounds. This left open the possibility of\nefficient SFM algorithms in poly-logarithmic rounds. For matroid intersection,\neven the possibility of a constant round, $\\mathrm{poly}(N)$ query algorithm\nwas not hitherto ruled out.\nIn this work, we prove that any, possibly randomized, algorithm for\nsubmodular function minimization or matroid intersection making\n$\\mathrm{poly}(N)$ queries requires $\\tilde{\\Omega}\\left(N^{1/3}\\right)$ rounds\nof adaptivity. In fact, we show a polynomial lower bound on the number of\nrounds of adaptivity even for algorithms that make at most $2^{N^{1-\\delta}}$\nqueries, for any constant $\\delta> 0$.

As a\nresult, many researchers use trajectory data to analyze mobility of various\nmoving objects. In this dissertation, we focus on the `urban vehicle\ntrajectory,' which refers to trajectories of vehicles in urban traffic\nnetworks, and we focus on `urban vehicle trajectory analytics.' The urban\nvehicle trajectory analytics offers unprecedented opportunities to understand\nvehicle movement patterns in urban traffic networks including both user-centric\ntravel experiences and system-wide spatiotemporal patterns. The spatiotemporal\nfeatures of urban vehicle trajectory data are structurally correlated with each\nother, and consequently, many previous researchers used various methods to\nunderstand this structure. Especially, deep-learning models are getting\nattentions of many researchers due to its powerful function approximation and\nfeature representation abilities. As a result, the objective of this\ndissertation is to develop deep-learning based models for urban vehicle\ntrajectory analytics to better understand the mobility patterns of urban\ntraffic networks. Particularly, this dissertation focuses on two research\ntopics, which has high necessity, importance and applicability: Next Location\nPrediction, and Synthetic Trajectory Generation.

In this paper, we propose a novel geometric-based approach\ncalled Tangent Attack (TA), which identifies an optimal tangent point of a\nvirtual hemisphere located on the decision boundary to reduce the distortion of\nthe attack. Assuming the decision boundary is locally flat, we theoretically\nprove that the minimum $\\ell_2$ distortion can be obtained by reaching the\ndecision boundary along the tangent line passing through such tangent point in\neach iteration. To improve the robustness of our method, we further propose a\ngeneralized method which replaces the hemisphere with a semi-ellipsoid to adapt\nto curved decision boundaries.

A new AI assurance definition is\nadopted and presented and assurance methods are contrasted and tabulated.\nAdditionally, a ten-metric scoring system is developed and introduced to\nevaluate and compare existing methods. Lastly, in this manuscript, we provide\nfoundational insights, discussions, future directions, a roadmap, and\napplicable recommendations for the development and deployment of AI assurance.",

    "abstract": "This magazine investigates the potential enhancement of the data throughput\nof ground users by integrating ground base stations (GBS) with air stations,\nsuch as balloon, airborne, and satellite. The objective is to establish dynamic\nbi-directional wireless services (i.e., uplink and downlink) for ground users\nin congested and remote areas. The proposed integration involves satellite,\nhigh-altitude platforms (HAPs), and tethered balloons (TBs) in the exosphere,\nstratosphere, and troposphere, respectively, for better altitude reuse coupled\nwith emerging optical or other high-frequency directional transceivers. This\nwill lead to a significant enhancement in scarce spectrum aggregate efficiency.\nHowever, the air stations deployment and resource managements in this\nintegrated system faces difficulties. This article tackles resource management\nchallenges by (i) providing wireless services to ground users in remote areas\nand connecting them with metropolitan and rural areas and (ii) employing HAPs\nequipped with free-space-optical communication modules as back-hauling\nbackbones. Finally, we illustrate some numerical results to show the benefit of\nour proposed integrated system.",

AI methods are allowing economists to solve such prediction problems\nin new ways.

    "abstract": "Accurate trajectory prediction of vehicles is essential for reliable\nautonomous driving. To maintain consistent performance as a vehicle driving\naround different cities, it is crucial to adapt to changing traffic\ncircumstances and achieve lifelong trajectory prediction model. To realize it,\ncatastrophic forgetting is a main problem to be addressed. In this paper, a\ndivergence measurement method based on conditional Kullback-Leibler divergence\nis proposed first to evaluate spatiotemporal dependency difference among varied\ndriving circumstances. Then based on generative replay, a novel lifelong\nvehicle trajectory prediction framework is developed. The framework consists of\na conditional generation model and a vehicle trajectory prediction model. The\nconditional generation model is a generative adversarial network conditioned on\nposition configuration of vehicles. After learning and merging trajectory\ndistribution of vehicles across different cities, the generation model replays\ntrajectories with prior samplings as inputs, which alleviates catastrophic\nforgetting. The vehicle trajectory prediction model is trained by the replayed\ntrajectories and achieves consistent prediction performance on visited cities.\nA lifelong experiment setup is established on four open datasets including five\ntasks. Spatiotemporal dependency divergence is calculated for different tasks.\nEven though these divergence, the proposed framework exhibits lifelong learning\nability and achieves consistent performance on all tasks.",

The spatial-temporal complexities in transportation networks make the\nproblem especially challenging. The recently suggested deep learning models\nshare basic elements such as graph convolution, graph attention, recurrent\nunits, and/or attention mechanism. In this study, we designed an in-depth\ncomparative study for four deep neural network models utilizing different basic\nelements. For base models, one RNN-based model and one attention-based model\nwere chosen from previous literature. Then, the spatial feature extraction\nlayers in the models were substituted with graph convolution and graph\nattention. To analyze the performance of each element in various environments,\nwe conducted experiments on four real-world datasets - highway speed, highway\nflow, urban speed from a homogeneous road link network, and urban speed from a\nheterogeneous road link network. The results demonstrate that the RNN-based\nmodel and the attention-based model show a similar level of performance for\nshort-term prediction, and the attention-based model outperforms the RNN in\nlonger-term predictions. The choice of graph convolution and graph attention\nmakes a larger difference in the RNN-based models.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of tracking 3D object poses from touch during in-hand\nmanipulations. Specifically, we look at tracking small objects using\nvision-based tactile sensors that provide high-dimensional tactile image\nmeasurements at the point of contact. While prior work has relied on a-priori\ninformation about the object being localized, we remove this requirement. Our\nkey insight is that an object is composed of several local surface patches,\neach informative enough to achieve reliable object tracking. Moreover, we can\nrecover the geometry of this local patch online by extracting local surface\nnormal information embedded in each tactile image. We propose a novel two-stage\napproach. First, we learn a mapping from tactile images to surface normals\nusing an image translation network. Second, we use these surface normals within\na factor graph to both reconstruct a local patch map and use it to infer 3D\nobject poses. We demonstrate reliable object tracking for over 100 contact\nsequences across unique shapes with four objects in simulation and two objects\nin the real-world.

However, there\nhas been no study employing feature engineering techniques to investigate the\nlinguistic features of RAs of different academic impacts (i.e., the papers of\nhigh/moderate citation times published in the journals of high/moderate impact\nfactors). This study attempts to extract micro-level linguistic features in\nhigh- and moderate-impact journal RAs, using feature engineering methods. We\nextracted 25 highly relevant features from the Corpus of English Journal\nArticles through feature selection methods. All papers in the corpus deal with\nCOVID-19 medical empirical studies. The selected features were then validated\nof the classification performance in terms of consistency and accuracy through\nsupervised machine learning methods. Results showed that 24 linguistic features\nsuch as the overlapping of content words between adjacent sentences, the use of\nthird-person pronouns, auxiliary verbs, tense, emotional words provide\nconsistent and accurate predictions for journal articles with different\nacademic impacts. Lastly, the random forest model is shown to be the best model\nto fit the relationship between these 24 features and journal articles with\nhigh and moderate impacts.

    "abstract": "A visual hard attention model actively selects and observes a sequence of\nsubregions in an image to make a prediction. The majority of hard attention\nmodels determine the attention-worthy regions by first analyzing a complete\nimage. However, it may be the case that the entire image is not available\ninitially but instead sensed gradually through a series of partial\nobservations. In this paper, we design an efficient hard attention model for\nclassifying such sequentially observed scenes. The presented model never\nobserves an image completely. To select informative regions under partial\nobservability, the model uses Bayesian Optimal Experiment Design. First, it\nsynthesizes the features of the unobserved regions based on the already\nobserved regions. Then, it uses the predicted features to estimate the expected\ninformation gain (EIG) attained, should various regions be attended. Finally,\nthe model attends to the actual content on the location where the EIG mentioned\nabove is maximum. The model uses a) a recurrent feature aggregator to maintain\na recurrent state, b) a linear classifier to predict the class label, c) a\nPartial variational autoencoder to predict the features of unobserved regions.\nWe use normalizing flows in Partial VAE to handle multi-modality in the\nfeature-synthesis problem.

The numerical method is based on the second-order\nbackward differentiation formula in time, combined with an implicit treatment\nof the linear diffusion term and explicit extrapolation for the nonlinear\nterms. Afterward, a projection step is applied to normalize the numerical\nsolution at a point-wise level. This numerical scheme has shown extensive\nadvantages in the practical computations for the physical model with large\ndamping parameters, which comes from the fact that only a linear system with\nconstant coefficients (independent of both time and the updated magnetization)\nneeds to be solved at each time step, and has greatly improved the numerical\nefficiency.

In this paper, we provide a rigorous error estimate of\nthe numerical scheme, in the discrete $\\ell^{\\infty}(0,T; \\ell^2) \\cap\n\\ell^2(0,T; H_h^1)$ norm, under suitable regularity assumptions and reasonable\nratio between the time step-size and the spatial mesh-size.

    "abstract": "As \\emph{artificial intelligence} (AI) systems are increasingly involved in\ndecisions affecting our lives, ensuring that automated decision-making is fair\nand ethical has become a top priority. Intuitively, we feel that akin to human\ndecisions, judgments of artificial agents should necessarily be grounded in\nsome moral principles. Yet a decision-maker (whether human or artificial) can\nonly make truly ethical (based on any ethical theory) and fair (according to\nany notion of fairness) decisions if full information on all the relevant\nfactors on which the decision is based are available at the time of\ndecision-making. This raises two problems: (1) In settings, where we rely on AI\nsystems that are using classifiers obtained with supervised learning, some\ninduction/generalization is present and some relevant attributes may not be\npresent even during learning. (2) Modeling such decisions as games reveals that\nany -- however ethical -- pure strategy is inevitably susceptible to\nexploitation.\nMoreover, in many games, a Nash Equilibrium can only be obtained by using\nmixed strategies, i.e., to achieve mathematically optimal outcomes, decisions\nmust be randomized. In this paper, we argue that in supervised learning\nsettings, there exist random classifiers that perform at least as well as\ndeterministic classifiers, and may hence be the optimal choice in many\ncircumstances. We support our theoretical results with an empirical study\nindicating a positive societal attitude towards randomized artificial\ndecision-makers, and discuss some policy and implementation issues related to\nthe use of random classifiers that relate to and are relevant for current AI\npolicy and standardization initiatives.",

    "title": "Unsupervised Lightweight Single Object Tracking with UHP-SOT++",
    "abstract": "An unsupervised, lightweight and high-performance single object tracker,\ncalled UHP-SOT, was proposed by Zhou et al. recently. As an extension, we\npresent an enhanced version and name it UHP-SOT++ in this work. Built upon the\nfoundation of the discriminative-correlation-filters-based (DCF-based) tracker,\ntwo new ingredients are introduced in UHP-SOT and UHP-SOT++: 1) background\nmotion modeling and 2) object box trajectory modeling. The main difference\nbetween UHP-SOT and UHP-SOT++ is the fusion strategy of proposals from three\nmodels (i.e., DCF, background motion and object box trajectory models). An\nimproved fusion strategy is adopted by UHP-SOT++ for more robust tracking\nperformance against large-scale tracking datasets. Our second contribution lies\nin an extensive evaluation of the performance of state-of-the-art supervised\nand unsupervised methods by testing them on four SOT benchmark datasets -\nOTB2015, TC128, UAV123 and LaSOT. Experiments show that UHP-SOT++ outperforms\nall previous unsupervised methods and several deep-learning (DL) methods in\ntracking accuracy. Since UHP-SOT++ has extremely small model size, high\ntracking performance, and low computational complexity (operating at a rate of\n20 FPS on an i5 CPU even without code optimization), it is an ideal solution in\nreal-time object tracking on resource-limited platforms. Based on the\nexperimental results, we compare pros and cons of supervised and unsupervised\ntrackers and provide a new perspective to understand the performance gap\nbetween supervised and unsupervised methods, which is the third contribution of\nthis work.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in end-to-end speech synthesis have made it possible to\ngenerate highly natural speech. However, training these models typically\nrequires a large amount of high-fidelity speech data, and for unseen texts, the\nprosody of synthesized speech is relatively unnatural. To address these issues,\nwe propose to combine a fine-tuned BERT-based front-end with a pre-trained\nFastSpeech2-based acoustic model to improve prosody modeling. The pre-trained\nBERT is fine-tuned on the polyphone disambiguation task, the joint Chinese word\nsegmentation (CWS) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging task, and the prosody\nstructure prediction (PSP) task in a multi-task learning framework. FastSpeech\n2 is pre-trained on large-scale external data that are noisy but easier to\nobtain. Experimental results show that both the fine-tuned BERT model and the\npre-trained FastSpeech 2 can improve prosody, especially for those structurally\ncomplex sentences.",

    "abstract": "Although the Industrial Internet of Things has increased the number of\nsensors permanently installed in industrial plants, there will be gaps in\ncoverage due to broken sensors or sparse density in very large plants, such as\nin the petrochemical industry. Modern emergency response operations are\nbeginning to use Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS) that have the ability to\ndrop sensor robots to precise locations. sUAS can provide longer-term\npersistent monitoring that aerial drones are unable to provide. Despite the\nrelatively low cost of these assets, the choice of which robotic sensing\nsystems to deploy to which part of an industrial process in a complex plant\nenvironment during emergency response remains challenging.\nThis paper describes a framework for optimizing the deployment of emergency\nsensors as a preliminary step towards realizing the responsiveness of robots in\ndisaster circumstances. AI techniques (Long short-term memory, 1-dimensional\nconvolutional neural network, logistic regression, and random forest) identify\nregions where sensors would be most valued without requiring humans to enter\nthe potentially dangerous area. In the case study described, the cost function\nfor optimization considers costs of false-positive and false-negative errors.\nDecisions on mitigation include implementing repairs or shutting down the\nplant. The Expected Value of Information (EVI) is used to identify the most\nvaluable type and location of physical sensors to be deployed to increase the\ndecision-analytic value of a sensor network. This method is applied to a case\nstudy using the Tennessee Eastman process data set of a chemical plant, and we\ndiscuss implications of our findings for operation, distribution, and\ndecision-making of sensors in plant emergency and resilience scenarios.",

Stakeholders from different industries, international foundations,\ngovernmental organisations and standards institutions quickly improvised and\ncreated various codes of ethics attempting to regulate AI. A major concern is\nthe large homogeneity and presumed consensualism around these principles. While\nit is true that some ethical doctrines, such as the famous Kantian deontology,\naspire to universalism, they are however not universal in practice. In fact,\nethical pluralism is more about differences in which relevant questions to ask\nrather than different answers to a common question. When people abide by\ndifferent moral doctrines, they tend to disagree on the very approach to an\nissue. Even when people from different cultures happen to agree on a set of\ncommon principles, it does not necessarily mean that they share the same\nunderstanding of these concepts and what they entail. In order to better\nunderstand the philosophical roots and cultural context underlying ethical\nprinciples in AI, we propose to analyse and compare the ethical principles\nendorsed by the Chinese National New Generation Artificial Intelligence\nGovernance Professional Committee (CNNGAIGPC) and those elaborated by the\nEuropean High-level Expert Group on AI (HLEGAI).

Summarized\nconversations are used to facilitate patient hand-offs between physicians, and\nas part of providing care in the future. Summaries, however, can be\ntime-consuming to produce and require domain expertise. Modern pre-trained NLP\nmodels such as PEGASUS have emerged as capable alternatives to human\nsummarization, reaching state-of-the-art performance on many summarization\nbenchmarks. However, many downstream tasks still require at least moderately\nsized datasets to achieve satisfactory performance. In this work we (1) explore\nthe effect of dataset size on transfer learning medical conversation\nsummarization using PEGASUS and (2) evaluate various iterative labeling\nstrategies in the low-data regime, following their success in the\nclassification setting. We find that model performance saturates with increase\nin dataset size and that the various active-learning strategies evaluated all\nshow equivalent performance consistent with simple dataset size increase. We\nalso find that naive iterative pseudo-labeling is on-par or slightly worse than\nno pseudo-labeling. Our work sheds light on the successes and challenges of\ntranslating low-data regime techniques in classification to medical\nconversation summarization and helps guides future work in this space.

In a significant improvement to the state of\nart for this problem, Umans \\cite{Umans08} and Kedlaya \\& Umans\n\\cite{Kedlaya11} gave nearly linear time algorithms for this problem over field\nof small characteristic and over all finite fields respectively, provided that\nthe number of variables $n$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$ where the degree of the input\npolynomial in every variable is less than $d$.

Gradient compression is relevant\nin many distributed DNN training scenarios, including the recently popular\nfederated learning (FL) scenario in which each remote users are connected to\nthe parameter server (PS) through a noiseless but rate limited channel. In\ndistributed DNN training, if the underlying gradient distribution is available,\nclassical lossless compression approaches can be used to reduce the number of\nbits required for communicating the gradient entries. Mean field analysis has\nsuggested that gradient updates can be considered as independent random\nvariables, while Laplace approximation can be used to argue that gradient has a\ndistribution approximating the normal (Norm) distribution in some regimes. In\nthis paper we argue that, for some networks of practical interest, the gradient\nentries can be well modelled as having a generalized normal (GenNorm)\ndistribution. We provide numerical evaluations to validate that the hypothesis\nGenNorm modelling provides a more accurate prediction of the DNN gradient tail\ndistribution. Additionally, this modeling choice provides concrete improvement\nin terms of lossless compression of the gradients when applying classical\nfix-to-variable lossless coding algorithms, such as Huffman coding, to the\nquantized gradient updates.

This\nmeans of face forgery can attack any target, which poses a new threat to\npersonal privacy and property security.

Inspired by the fact that the spatial coherence and temporal\nconsistency of physiological signal are destroyed in the generated content, we\nattempt to find inconsistent patterns that can distinguish between real videos\nand synthetic videos from the variations of facial pixels, which are highly\nrelated to physiological information. Our approach first applies Eulerian Video\nMagnification (EVM) at multiple Gaussian scales to the original video to\nenlarge the physiological variations caused by the change of facial blood\nvolume, and then transform the original video and magnified videos into a\nMulti-Scale Eulerian Magnified Spatial-Temporal map (MEMSTmap), which can\nrepresent time-varying physiological enhancement sequences on different\noctaves.

    "title": "Spectral Transform Forms Scalable Transformer",
    "abstract": "Many real-world relational systems, such as social networks and biological\nsystems, contain dynamic interactions. When learning dynamic graph\nrepresentation, it is essential to employ sequential temporal information and\ngeometric structure. Mainstream work achieves topological embedding via message\npassing networks (e.g., GCN, GAT). The temporal evolution, on the other hand,\nis conventionally expressed via memory units (e.g., LSTM or GRU) that possess\nconvenient information filtration in a gate mechanism. Though, such a design\nprevents large-scale input sequence due to the over-complicated encoding. This\nwork learns from the philosophy of self-attention and proposes an efficient\nspectral-based neural unit that employs informative long-range temporal\ninteraction. The developed spectral window unit (SWINIT) model predicts\nscalable dynamic graphs with assured efficiency. The architecture is assembled\nwith a few simple effective computational blocks that constitute randomized\nSVD, MLP, and graph Framelet convolution. The SVD plus MLP module encodes the\nlong-short-term feature evolution of the dynamic graph events. A fast framelet\ngraph transform in the framelet convolution embeds the structural dynamics.\nBoth strategies enhance the model's ability on scalable analysis. In\nparticular, the iterative SVD approximation shrinks the computational\ncomplexity of attention to O(Nd\\log(d)) for the dynamic graph with N edges and\nd edge features, and the multiscale transform of framelet convolution allows\nsufficient scalability in the network training. Our SWINIT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on a variety of online continuous-time dynamic\ngraph learning tasks, while compared to baseline methods, the number of its\nlearnable parameters reduces by up to seven times.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models based on temporal point processes are the state of\nthe art in a wide variety of applications involving discrete events in\ncontinuous time. However, these models lack the ability to answer\ncounterfactual questions, which are increasingly relevant as these models are\nbeing used to inform targeted interventions. In this work, our goal is to fill\nthis gap. To this end, we first develop a causal model of thinning for temporal\npoint processes that builds upon the Gumbel-Max structural causal model. This\nmodel satisfies a desirable counterfactual monotonicity condition, which is\nsufficient to identify counterfactual dynamics in the process of thinning.\nThen, given an observed realization of a temporal point process with a given\nintensity function, we develop a sampling algorithm that uses the above causal\nmodel of thinning and the superposition theorem to simulate counterfactual\nrealizations of the temporal point process under a given alternative intensity\nfunction. Simulation experiments using synthetic and real epidemiological data\nshow that the counterfactual realizations provided by our algorithm may give\nvaluable insights to enhance targeted interventions.",

    "title": "Property Inference Attacks Against GANs",
    "abstract": "While machine learning (ML) has made tremendous progress during the past\ndecade, recent research has shown that ML models are vulnerable to various\nsecurity and privacy attacks. So far, most of the attacks in this field focus\non discriminative models, represented by classifiers. Meanwhile, little\nattention has been paid to the security and privacy risks of generative models,\nsuch as generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this paper, we propose the\nfirst set of training dataset property inference attacks against GANs.\nConcretely, the adversary aims to infer the macro-level training dataset\nproperty, i.e., the proportion of samples used to train a target GAN with\nrespect to a certain attribute. A successful property inference attack can\nallow the adversary to gain extra knowledge of the target GAN's training\ndataset, thereby directly violating the intellectual property of the target\nmodel owner. Also, it can be used as a fairness auditor to check whether the\ntarget GAN is trained with a biased dataset. Besides, property inference can\nserve as a building block for other advanced attacks, such as membership\ninference. We propose a general attack pipeline that can be tailored to two\nattack scenarios, including the full black-box setting and partial black-box\nsetting. For the latter, we introduce a novel optimization framework to\nincrease the attack efficacy. Extensive experiments over four representative\nGAN models on five property inference tasks show that our attacks achieve\nstrong performance. In addition, we show that our attacks can be used to\nenhance the performance of membership inference against GANs.",

However, these algorithms are built under the assumption that the\nsequences of states, actions and rewards associated with each episode arrive\nimmediately, allowing policy updates after every interaction with the\nenvironment. This assumption is often unrealistic in practice, particularly in\nareas such as healthcare and online recommendation. In this paper, we study the\nimpact of delayed feedback on several provably efficient algorithms for regret\nminimisation in episodic reinforcement learning. Firstly, we consider updating\nthe policy as soon as new feedback becomes available. Using this updating\nscheme, we show that the regret increases by an additive term involving the\nnumber of states, actions, episode length and the expected delay. This additive\nterm changes depending on the optimistic algorithm of choice. We also show that\nupdating the policy less frequently can lead to an improved dependency of the\nregret on the delays.",

    "abstract": "Due to the diversity of attack materials, fingerprint recognition systems\n(AFRSs) are vulnerable to malicious attacks. It is of great importance to\npropose effective Fingerprint Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) methods for\nthe safety and reliability of AFRSs. However, current PAD methods often have\npoor robustness under new attack materials or sensor settings. This paper thus\nproposes a novel Channel-wise Feature Denoising fingerprint PAD (CFD-PAD)\nmethod by considering handling the redundant \"noise\" information which ignored\nin previous works. The proposed method learned important features of\nfingerprint images by weighting the importance of each channel and finding\nthose discriminative channels and \"noise\" channels. Then, the propagation of\n\"noise\" channels is suppressed in the feature map to reduce interference.\nSpecifically, a PA-Adaption loss is designed to constrain the feature\ndistribution so as to make the feature distribution of live fingerprints more\naggregate and spoof fingerprints more disperse. Our experimental results\nevaluated on LivDet 2017 showed that our proposed CFD-PAD can achieve 2.53% ACE\nand 93.83% True Detection Rate when the False Detection Rate equals to 1.0%\n(TDR@FDR=1%) and it outperforms the best single model based methods in terms of\nACE (2.53% vs. 4.56%) and TDR@FDR=1%(93.83% vs. 73.32\\%) significantly, which\nproves the effectiveness of the proposed method. Although we have achieved a\ncomparable result compared with the state-of-the-art multiple model based\nmethod, there still achieves an increase of TDR@FDR=1% from 91.19% to 93.83% by\nour method.

In the meantime, two main\napproaches have been established: validation in reduced resolution and original\nresolution. In the former approach it is still not clear how the data are to be\nprocessed to a lower resolution. Other open issues are related to the question\nwhich resolution and measures should be used. In the latter approach the main\nproblem is how the appropriate measure should be selected. In the most\ncomparison studies the results of both approaches do not correspond, that means\nin each case other methods are selected as the best ones.

Extracting new features is typically quite expensive or infeasible in\nthe case of very large gallery-sets and/or real time systems (i.e.,\nface-recognition systems, social networks, life-long learning systems, robotics\nand surveillance systems).

On the other hand,\nthe domain of animation faces has been studied less intensively due to the\nabsence of a well-organized dataset. In this paper, we present a large-scale\nanimation celebfaces dataset (AnimeCeleb) via controllable synthetic animation\nmodels to boost research on the animation face domain. To facilitate the data\ngeneration process, we build a semi-automatic pipeline based on an open 3D\nsoftware and a developed annotation system. This leads to constructing a\nlarge-scale animation face dataset that includes multi-pose and multi-style\nanimation faces with rich annotations. Experiments suggest that our dataset is\napplicable to various animation-related tasks such as head reenactment and\ncolorization.",

Among several security issues, data integrity attacks can\nlead to inconsistent data and intrude edge data analytics. Further\nintensification of the attack makes it challenging to mitigate and identify the\nroot cause. Therefore, this paper proposes a new concept of data quarantine\nmodel to mitigate data integrity attacks by quarantining intruders. The\nefficient security solutions in cloud, ad-hoc networks, and computer systems\nusing quarantine have motivated adopting it in edge computing. The data\nacquisition edge nodes identify the intruders and quarantine all the suspected\ndevices through dimensionality reduction.

    "abstract": "We propose to combine the ideas of mass redistribution and component mode\nsynthesis. More specifically, we employ the MacNeal method, which readily leads\nto a singular mass matrix, and an accordingly modified version of the\nCraig-Bampton method. Besides obtaining a massless boundary, we achieve a\ndrastic reduction of the mathematical model order in this way compared to the\nparent finite element model. Contact is modeled using set-valued laws and time\nstepping is carried out with a semi-explicit scheme. We assess the method's\ncomputational performance by a series of benchmarks, including both\nfrictionless and frictional contact. The results indicate that the proposed\nmethod achieves excellent energy conservation properties and superior\nconvergence behavior. It reduces the spurious oscillations and decreases the\ncomputational effort by about 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to the current\nstate of the art (mass-carrying component mode synthesis method). We believe\nthat the computational performance and favorable energy conservation properties\nwill be valuable for the prediction of vibro-impact processes and physical\ndamping.",

    "title": "Joint Synthesis of Safety Certificate and Safe Control Policy using  Constrained Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Safety is the major consideration in controlling complex dynamical systems\nusing reinforcement learning (RL), where the safety certificate can provide\nprovable safety guarantee. A valid safety certificate is an energy function\nindicating that safe states are with low energy, and there exists a\ncorresponding safe control policy that allows the energy function to always\ndissipate. The safety certificate and the safe control policy are closely\nrelated to each other and both challenging to synthesize. Therefore, existing\nlearning-based studies treat either of them as prior knowledge to learn the\nother, which limits their applicability with general unknown dynamics. This\npaper proposes a novel approach that simultaneously synthesizes the\nenergy-function-based safety certificate and learns the safe control policy\nwith CRL. We do not rely on prior knowledge about either an available\nmodel-based controller or a perfect safety certificate. In particular, we\nformulate a loss function to optimize the safety certificate parameters by\nminimizing the occurrence of energy increases. By adding this optimization\nprocedure as an outer loop to the Lagrangian-based constrained reinforcement\nlearning (CRL), we jointly update the policy and safety certificate parameters\nand prove that they will converge to their respective local optima, the optimal\nsafe policy and a valid safety certificate. We evaluate our algorithms on\nmultiple safety-critical benchmark environments. The results show that the\nproposed algorithm learns provably safe policies with no constraint violation.\nThe validity or feasibility of synthesized safety certificate is also verified\nnumerically.",

Specifically, we first derive convex models of the\npowertrain components, including the battery, the EM, the transmission and a\nLumped Parameter Thermal Network (LPTN) capturing the thermal dynamics of the\nEM. Second, we frame the optimal control problem in time domain, and devise a\ntwo-step algorithm to accelerate convergence and efficiently solve the\nresulting convex problem via nonlinear programming. Subsequently, we present a\ncase study for a compact family car, optimize its transmission design and\noperation jointly with the regenerative braking and EM cooling control\nstrategies for different motors and transmission technologies. We validate our\nproposed models using the high-fidelity simulation software Motor-CAD, showing\nthat the LPTN quite accurately captures the thermal dynamics of the EM, and\nthat the permanent magnets' temperature is the limiting factor during extended\ndriving. Furthermore, our results reveal that powertrains equipped with a\ncontinuously variable transmission (CVT) result into a lower energy consumption\nthan with a fixed-gear transmission (FGT), as a CVT can lower the EM losses,\nresulting in lower EM temperatures.

Learning and then composing modules to\nsolve different tasks provides an abstraction to address the principal\nchallenges of CL including catastrophic forgetting, backward and forward\ntransfer across tasks, and sub-linear model growth. We introduce local module\ncomposition (LMC), an approach to modular CL where each module is provided a\nlocal structural component that estimates a module's relevance to the input.\nDynamic module composition is performed layer-wise based on local relevance\nscores. We demonstrate that agnosticity to task identities (IDs) arises from\n(local) structural learning that is module-specific as opposed to the task-\nand/or model-specific as in previous works, making LMC applicable to more CL\nsettings compared to previous works. In addition, LMC also tracks statistics\nabout the input distribution and adds new modules when outlier samples are\ndetected. In the first set of experiments, LMC performs favorably compared to\nexisting methods on the recent Continual Transfer-learning Benchmark without\nrequiring task identities. In another study, we show that the locality of\nstructural learning allows LMC to interpolate to related but unseen tasks\n(OOD), as well as to compose modular networks trained independently on\ndifferent task sequences into a third modular network without any fine-tuning.\nFinally, in search for limitations of LMC we study it on more challenging\nsequences of 30 and 100 tasks, demonstrating that local module selection\nbecomes much more challenging in presence of a large number of candidate\nmodules. In this setting best performing LMC spawns much fewer modules compared\nto an oracle based baseline, however, it reaches a lower overall accuracy.

In this work, we\nfocus specifically on the fine-grained identification of code elements (i.e.,\ntokens) that must be changed to fix a buggy program: we refer to it as fix\nlocalization. This paper introduces a neural network architecture (named Beep)\nthat builds on AST paths to predict the buggy code element as well as the\nchange action that must be applied to repair a program. Leveraging massive data\nof bugs and patches within the CoCoNut dataset, we trained a model that was (1)\neffective in localizing the buggy tokens with the Mean First Rank significantly\nhigher than a statistics based baseline and a machine learning-based baseline,\nand (2) effective in predicting the repair operators (with the associated buggy\ncode elements) with a Recall@1= 30-45% and the Mean First Rank=7-12 (evaluated\nby CoCoNut, ManySStuBs4J, and Defects4J datasets). To showcase how fine-grained\nfix localization can help program repair, we employ it in two repair pipelines\nwhere we use either a code completion engine to predict the correct token or a\nset of heuristics to search for the suitable donor code. A key strength of\naccurate fix localization for program repair is that it reduces the chance of\npatch overfitting, a challenge in generate-and-validate automated program\nrepair: both two repair pipelines achieve a correctness ratio of 100%, i.e.,\nall generated patches are found to be correct.

    "title": "Parsing Data Formats of the Inputs and Outputs of Geographic Models with  Code Analysis",
    "abstract": "Model web services provide an approach for implementing and facilitating the\nsharing of geographic models. The description and acquisition of inputs and\noutputs (IO) of geographic models is a key issue in constructing and using\nmodel web services. These approaches for describing and acquiring the data\nformats of the IO of geographic models can be classified into two categories,\ni.e., intermediate-data-format-based and native-data-format-based. Nonetheless,\nthese two categories mainly consider the description of the IO of geographical\nmodels but relatively pay little attention to the acquisition. To address this\nissue, this paper proposes an approach for automatically parsing data formats\nof the IO utilizing the relationship between the IO and source codes. This\nproposed approach can utilize such a strict and coupling relationship and the\nexpression form of the data formats in the source codes to retrospectively\nderive the IO data format and automatically generate data format documentation.\nThe feasibility of the proposed approach has been verified via a geographical\nmodel coded in the FORTRAN language, which shows that it significantly improves\nthe efficiency of writing data format specifications and promotes sharing\ngeographic models as model web services.",

The\ndiscontinuous interaction dynamics of such tasks make it difficult to construct\nand use a single dynamics model or control strategy, and the highly non-linear\nnature of the dynamics during contact changes can be damaging to the robot and\nthe objects. We present an adaptive control framework that enables the robot to\nincrementally learn to predict contact changes in a changing contact task,\nlearn the interaction dynamics of the piece-wise continuous system, and provide\nsmooth and accurate trajectory tracking using a task-space variable impedance\ncontroller. We experimentally compare the performance of our framework against\nthat of representative control methods to establish that the adaptive control\nand incremental learning components of our framework are needed to achieve\nsmooth control in the presence of discontinuous dynamics in changing-contact\nrobot manipulation tasks.",

We\nintroduce methods for answering nearest neighbor and range queries regarding\nthis distance efficiently for large databases with up to millions of graphs. We\nbuild on the filter-verification paradigm, where lower and upper bounds are\nused to reduce the number of exact computations of the graph edit distance.\nHighly effective bounds for this involve solving a linear assignment problem\nfor each graph in the database, which is prohibitive in massive datasets.\nIndex-based approaches typically provide only weak bounds leading to high\ncomputational costs verification. In this work, we derive novel lower bounds\nfor efficient filtering from restricted assignment problems, where the cost\nfunction is a tree metric. This special case allows embedding the costs of\noptimal assignments isometrically into $\\ell_1$ space, rendering efficient\nindexing possible. We propose several lower bounds of the graph edit distance\nobtained from tree metrics reflecting the edit costs, which are combined for\neffective filtering. Our method termed EmbAssi can be integrated into existing\nfilter-verification pipelines as a fast and effective pre-filtering step.\nEmpirically we show that for many real-world graphs our lower bounds are\nalready close to the exact graph edit distance, while our index construction\nand search scales to very large databases.",

Existing works have simultaneously justified the efficacy of\ndilated and deformable convolutions for various image-level segmentation tasks.\nThis gives reason to believe that 3D extensions of such convolutions should\nalso yield performance improvements for video-level segmentation tasks.\nHowever, this aspect has not yet been explored thoroughly in existing\nliterature. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Dilated Convolutions (D^2Conv3D):\na novel type of convolution which draws inspiration from dilated and deformable\nconvolutions and extends them to the 3D (spatio-temporal) domain. We\nexperimentally show that D^2Conv3D can be used to improve the performance of\nmultiple 3D CNN architectures across multiple video segmentation related\nbenchmarks by simply employing D^2Conv3D as a drop-in replacement for standard\nconvolutions.

    "abstract": "Learning representations for pixel-based control has garnered significant\nattention recently in reinforcement learning. A wide range of methods have been\nproposed to enable efficient learning, leading to sample complexities similar\nto those in the full state setting. However, moving beyond carefully curated\npixel data sets (centered crop, appropriate lighting, clear background, etc.)\nremains challenging. In this paper, we adopt a more difficult setting,\nincorporating background distractors, as a first step towards addressing this\nchallenge. We present a simple baseline approach that can learn meaningful\nrepresentations with no metric-based learning, no data augmentations, no\nworld-model learning, and no contrastive learning. We then analyze when and why\npreviously proposed methods are likely to fail or reduce to the same\nperformance as the baseline in this harder setting and why we should think\ncarefully about extending such methods beyond the well curated environments.\nOur results show that finer categorization of benchmarks on the basis of\ncharacteristics like density of reward, planning horizon of the problem,\npresence of task-irrelevant components, etc., is crucial in evaluating\nalgorithms. Based on these observations, we propose different metrics to\nconsider when evaluating an algorithm on benchmark tasks.

Existing methods often model the\ncross-modal interaction either via the similarity of the global feature of each\nmodality which misses sufficient information, or finer-grained interactions\nusing cross/self-attention upon visual and textual tokens. However,\ncross/self-attention suffers from inferior efficiency in both training and\ninference. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale Fine-grained Interactive\nLanguage-Image Pre-training (FILIP) to achieve finer-level alignment through a\ncross-modal late interaction mechanism, which uses a token-wise maximum\nsimilarity between visual and textual tokens to guide the contrastive\nobjective. FILIP successfully leverages the finer-grained expressiveness\nbetween image patches and textual words by modifying only contrastive loss,\nwhile simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute image and text\nrepresentations offline at inference, keeping both large-scale training and\ninference efficient. Furthermore, we construct a new large-scale image-text\npair dataset called FILIP300M for pre-training. Experiments show that FILIP\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream vision-language\ntasks including zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval.

    "title": "Sentiment Analysis of Fashion Related Posts in Social Media",
    "abstract": "The role of social media in fashion industry has been blooming as the years\nhave continued on. In this work, we investigate sentiment analysis for fashion\nrelated posts in social media platforms. There are two main challenges of this\ntask. On the first place, information of different modalities must be jointly\nconsidered to make the final predictions. On the second place, some unique\nfashion related attributes should be taken into account. While most existing\nworks focus on traditional multimodal sentiment analysis, they always fail to\nexploit the fashion related attributes in this task. We propose a novel\nframework that jointly leverages the image vision, post text, as well as\nfashion attribute modality to determine the sentiment category. One\ncharacteristic of our model is that it extracts fashion attributes and\nintegrates them with the image vision information for effective representation.\nFurthermore, it exploits the mutual relationship between the fashion attributes\nand the post texts via a mutual attention mechanism. Since there is no existing\ndataset suitable for this task, we prepare a large-scale sentiment analysis\ndataset of over 12k fashion related social media posts. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",

    "abstract": "A classical learning setting is one in which a student collects data, or\nobservations, about a system, and estimates a certain quantity of interest\nabout it. Correctional learning is a type of cooperative teacher-student\nframework where a teacher, who has knowledge about the system, has the\npossibility to observe and alter (correct) the observations received by the\nstudent in order to improve its estimation. In this paper, we show that the\nvariance of the estimate of the student is reduced with the help of the\nteacher. We further formulate the online problem - where the teacher has to\ndecide at each time instant whether or not to change the observations - as a\nMarkov decision process, from which the optimal policy is derived using dynamic\nprogramming. We validate the framework in numerical experiments, and compare\nthe optimal online policy with the one from the batch setting.",

One of the primary effects applied to images\ncaptured in portrait mode is a synthetic shallow depth of field (DoF). The\nsynthetic DoF (or bokeh effect) selectively blurs regions in the image to\nemulate the effect of using a large lens with a wide aperture. In addition,\nmany applications now incorporate a new image motion attribute (NIMAT) to\nemulate background motion, where the motion is correlated with estimated depth\nat each pixel. In this work, we follow the trend of rendering the NIMAT effect\nby introducing a modification on the blur synthesis procedure in portrait mode.\nIn particular, our modification enables a high-quality synthesis of multi-view\nbokeh from a single image by applying rotated blurring kernels. Given the\nsynthesized multiple views, we can generate aesthetically realistic image\nmotion similar to the NIMAT effect. We validate our approach qualitatively\ncompared to the original NIMAT effect and other similar image motions, like\nFacebook 3D image.

Existing works usually formulate VAD as a reconstruction or\nprediction problem. However, the adaptability and scalability of these methods\nare limited. In this paper, we propose a novel distance-based VAD method to\ntake advantage of all the available normal data efficiently and flexibly. In\nour method, the smaller the distance between a testing sample and normal\nsamples, the higher the probability that the testing sample is normal.\nSpecifically, we propose to use locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to map samples\nwhose similarity exceeds a certain threshold into the same bucket in advance.\nIn this manner, the complexity of near neighbor search is cut down\nsignificantly. To make the samples that are semantically similar get closer and\nsamples not similar get further apart, we propose a novel learnable version of\nLSH that embeds LSH into a neural network and optimizes the hash functions with\ncontrastive learning strategy. The proposed method is robust to data imbalance\nand can handle the large intra-class variations in normal data flexibly.\nBesides, it has a good ability of scalability.

In order to efficiently manage the sewerage\ninfrastructure, automated sewer inspection has to be utilized. However, while\nsewer defect classification has been investigated for decades, little attention\nhas been given to classifying sewer pipe properties such as water level, pipe\nmaterial, and pipe shape, which are needed to evaluate the level of sewer pipe\ndeterioration.\nIn this work we classify sewer pipe defects and properties concurrently and\npresent a novel decoder-focused multi-task classification architecture\nCross-Task Graph Neural Network (CT-GNN), which refines the disjointed per-task\npredictions using cross-task information. The CT-GNN architecture extends the\ntraditional disjointed task-heads decoder, by utilizing a cross-task graph and\nunique class node embeddings. The cross-task graph can either be determined a\npriori based on the conditional probability between the task classes or\ndetermined dynamically using self-attention.

    "abstract": "Softwarization and virtualization are key concepts for emerging industries\nthat require ultra-low latency. This is only possible if computing resources,\ntraditionally centralized at the core of communication networks, are moved\ncloser to the user, to the network edge. However, the realization of Edge\nComputing (EC) in the sixth generation (6G) of mobile networks requires\nefficient resource allocation mechanisms for the placement of the Virtual\nNetwork Functions (VNFs). Machine learning (ML) methods, and more specifically,\nReinforcement Learning (RL), are a promising approach to solve this problem.\nThe main contributions of this work are twofold: first, we obtain the\ntheoretical performance bound for VNF placement in EC-enabled6G networks by\nformulating the problem mathematically as a finite Markov Decision Process\n(MDP) and solving it using a dynamic programming method called Policy Iteration\n(PI). Second, we develop a practical solution to the problem using RL, where\nthe problem is treated with Q-Learning that considers both computational and\ncommunication resources when placing VNFs in the network. The simulation\nresults under different settings of the system parameters show that the\nperformance of the Q-Learning approach is close to the optimal PI algorithm\n(without having its restrictive assumptions on service statistics). This is\nparticularly interesting when the EC resources are scarce and efficient\nmanagement of these resources is required.",

    "abstract": "Over the last years, word and sentence embeddings have established as text\npreprocessing for all kinds of NLP tasks and improved the performances\nsignificantly. Unfortunately, it has also been shown that these embeddings\ninherit various kinds of biases from the training data and thereby pass on\nbiases present in society to NLP solutions. Many papers attempted to quantify\nbias in word or sentence embeddings to evaluate debiasing methods or compare\ndifferent embedding models, usually with cosine-based metrics. However, lately\nsome works have raised doubts about these metrics showing that even though such\nmetrics report low biases, other tests still show biases. In fact, there is a\ngreat variety of bias metrics or tests proposed in the literature without any\nconsensus on the optimal solutions. Yet we lack works that evaluate bias\nmetrics on a theoretical level or elaborate the advantages and disadvantages of\ndifferent bias metrics. In this work, we will explore different cosine based\nbias metrics. We formalize a bias definition based on the ideas from previous\nworks and derive conditions for bias metrics. Furthermore, we thoroughly\ninvestigate the existing cosine-based metrics and their limitations to show why\nthese metrics can fail to report biases in some cases.

These behaviors sometimes cause the model's loss surface\nto change dramatically over short periods of time.

Unlike\npast approaches which employ 2D representations, we focus on using 3D\nrepresentations of people, located in three-dimensional space. To this end, we\ndevelop a method, Human Mesh and Appearance Recovery (HMAR) which in addition\nto extracting the 3D geometry of the person as a SMPL mesh, also extracts\nappearance as a texture map on the triangles of the mesh. This serves as a 3D\nrepresentation for appearance that is robust to viewpoint and pose changes.\nGiven a video clip, we first detect bounding boxes corresponding to people, and\nfor each one, we extract 3D appearance, pose, and location information using\nHMAR. These embedding vectors are then sent to a transformer, which performs\nspatio-temporal aggregation of the representations over the duration of the\nsequence.

Furthermore, source code generated by genetic programming\napproaches is often bloated and difficult to understand.

    "abstract": "We consider a distributed storage system with $n$ nodes, where a user can\nrecover the stored file from any $k$ nodes, and study the problem of repairing\n$r$ partially failed nodes. We consider \\textit{broadcast repair}, that is, $d$\nsurviving nodes transmit broadcast messages on an error-free wireless channel\nto the $r$ nodes being repaired, which are then used, together with the\nsurviving data in the local memories of the failed nodes, to recover the lost\ncontent. First, we derive the trade-off between the storage capacity and the\nrepair bandwidth for partial repair of multiple failed nodes, based on the\ncut-set bound for information flow graphs. It is shown that utilizing the\nbroadcast nature of the wireless medium and the surviving contents at the\npartially failed nodes reduces the repair bandwidth per node significantly.\nThen, we list a set of invariant conditions that are sufficient for a\nfunctional repair code to be feasible. We further propose a scheme for\nfunctional repair of multiple failed nodes that satisfies the invariant\nconditions with high probability, and its extension to the repair of partial\nfailures. The performance of the proposed scheme meets the cut-set bound on all\nthe points on the trade-off curve for all admissible parameters when $k$ is\ndivisible by $r$, while employing linear subpacketization, which is an\nimportant practical consideration in the design of distributed storage codes.\nUnlike random linear codes, which are conventionally used for functional repair\nof failed nodes, the proposed repair scheme has lower overhead, lower\ninput-output cost, and lower computational complexity during repair.",

In particular, we considered\nthe use of SDP with the block sequential regularized expectation maximization\n(BSREM) approach with the relative difference prior (RDP) regularizer due to\nits prior clinical adaptation by vendors. Because the RDP regularization\npromotes smoothness in the reconstructed image, the directions of the gradients\nin smooth areas more accurately point toward the objective function's minimizer\nthan those in variable areas. Motivated by this observation, two SDPs have been\ndesigned to increase iteration step-sizes in the smooth areas and reduce\niteration step-sizes in the variable areas relative to a conventional\nexpectation maximization preconditioner. The momentum technique used for\nconvergence acceleration can be viewed as a special case of SDP. We have proved\nthe global convergence of SDP-BSREM algorithms by assuming certain\ncharacteristics of the preconditioner. By means of numerical experiments using\nboth simulated and clinical PET data, we have shown that our SDP-BSREM\nsubstantially improved the convergence rate, as compared to conventional BSREM\nand a vendor's implementation as Q.Clear.

MRI shows potential as a research tool as it provides signals\ndirectly related to placental function. However, due to the curved and highly\nvariable in vivo shape of the placenta, interpreting and visualizing these\nimages is difficult. We address interpretation challenges by mapping the\nplacenta so that it resembles the familiar ex vivo shape. We formulate the\nparameterization as an optimization problem for mapping the placental shape\nrepresented by a volumetric mesh to a flattened template. We employ the\nsymmetric Dirichlet energy to control local distortion throughout the volume.\nLocal injectivity in the mapping is enforced by a constrained line search\nduring the gradient descent optimization. We validate our method using a\nresearch study of 111 placental shapes extracted from BOLD MRI images. Our\nmapping achieves sub-voxel accuracy in matching the template while maintaining\nlow distortion throughout the volume.

    "abstract": "Editing and manipulating facial features in videos is an interesting and\nimportant field of research with a plethora of applications, ranging from movie\npost-production and visual effects to realistic avatars for video games and\nvirtual assistants. To the best of our knowledge, this paper proposes the first\nmethod to perform photorealistic manipulation of facial expressions in videos.\nOur method supports semantic video manipulation based on neural rendering and\n3D-based facial expression modelling. We focus on interactive manipulation of\nthe videos by altering and controlling the facial expressions, achieving\npromising photorealistic results. The proposed method is based on a\ndisentangled representation and estimation of the 3D facial shape and activity,\nproviding the user with intuitive and easy-to-use control of the facial\nexpressions in the input video. We also introduce a user-friendly, interactive\nAI tool that processes human-readable semantic labels about the desired emotion\nmanipulations in specific parts of the input video and synthesizes\nphotorealistic manipulated videos. We achieve that by mapping the emotion\nlabels to valence-arousal (VA) values, which in turn are mapped to disentangled\n3D facial expressions through an especially designed and trained expression\ndecoder network.

    "abstract": "Deploying federated learning (FL) over wireless networks with\nresource-constrained devices requires balancing between accuracy, energy\nefficiency, and precision. Prior art on FL often requires devices to train deep\nneural networks (DNNs) using a 32-bit precision level for data representation\nto improve accuracy. However, such algorithms are impractical for\nresource-constrained devices since DNNs could require execution of millions of\noperations. Thus, training DNNs with a high precision level incurs a high\nenergy cost for FL. In this paper, a quantized FL framework, that represents\ndata with a finite level of precision in both local training and uplink\ntransmission, is proposed. Here, the finite level of precision is captured\nthrough the use of quantized neural networks (QNNs) that quantize weights and\nactivations in fixed-precision format. In the considered FL model, each device\ntrains its QNN and transmits a quantized training result to the base station.\nEnergy models for the local training and the transmission with the quantization\nare rigorously derived. An energy minimization problem is formulated with\nrespect to the level of precision while ensuring convergence. To solve the\nproblem, we first analytically derive the FL convergence rate and use a line\nsearch method. Simulation results show that our FL framework can reduce energy\nconsumption by up to 53% compared to a standard FL model. The results also shed\nlight on the tradeoff between precision, energy, and accuracy in FL over\nwireless networks.",

Utilization of the dual trellis\nproposed by Yamada \\emph{et al.} lowers the complexity of CRC-aided serial list\nViterbi decoding (SLVD) of ZTCCs and TBCCs. CRC-aided SLVD of the TBCCs closely\napproaches the RCU bound at a blocklength of $128$.",

ZERO provides a comprehensive toolkit\nof modeling interfaces for designing games, helper tools, and algorithms to\nfind Nash equilibria. Specifically, the software supports Reciprocally Bilinear\nGames (RBGs), i.e., simultaneous non-cooperative games where each player solves\na mathematical program with a linear objective in the player's variable and\nbilinear in its opponents' variables. This class of games generalizes to a\nmulti-agent setting the classical problems of Operations Research. ZERO\nprovides extended support for integer non-convexities, linear bilevel problems,\nand linear equilibrium problems with equilibrium constraints. Its modular\nstructure provides users with all the elementary ingredients to devise new\nmodels and algorithms for RBGs, aiming to boost methodological advancement in\nthe field. We provide an overview of the software's key components and showcase\na Knapsack Game, i.e., each player solves a binary knapsack problem.

Further, we show that the content of\nthe generated summaries can be controlled based on which NPs are marked in the\ninput document.

To promote the development of\nocclusion understanding, we collect a large-scale dataset called OVIS for video\ninstance segmentation in the occluded scenario.

In this paper we present a new contrastive\nself-supervised representation learning algorithm in the context of Copy\nDetection in the 2021 Image Similarity Challenge hosted by Facebook AI\nResearch. Previous work in contrastive self-supervised learning has identified\nthe importance of being able to optimize representations while ``pushing''\nagainst a large number of negative examples.

We approach this problem from a new\nangle: We directly learn a query model and a key model jointly and push\nrepresentations against a very large number (e.g., 1 million) of negative\nrepresentations in each SGD step. We achieve this by freezing the backbone on\none side and by alternating between a Q-optimization step and a K-optimization\nstep. During the competition timeframe, our algorithms achieved a micro-AP\nscore of 0.3401 on the Phase 1 leaderboard, significantly improving over the\nbaseline $\\mu$AP of 0.1556.

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks pose a new threat to NLP models. A standard strategy to\nconstruct poisoned data in backdoor attacks is to insert triggers (e.g., rare\nwords) into selected sentences and alter the original label to a target label.\nThis strategy comes with a severe flaw of being easily detected from both the\ntrigger and the label perspectives: the trigger injected, which is usually a\nrare word, leads to an abnormal natural language expression, and thus can be\neasily detected by a defense model; the changed target label leads the example\nto be mistakenly labeled and thus can be easily detected by manual inspections.\nTo deal with this issue, in this paper, we propose a new strategy to perform\ntextual backdoor attacks which do not require an external trigger, and the\npoisoned samples are correctly labeled. The core idea of the proposed strategy\nis to construct clean-labeled examples, whose labels are correct but can lead\nto test label changes when fused with the training set. To generate poisoned\nclean-labeled examples, we propose a sentence generation model based on the\ngenetic algorithm to cater to the non-differentiable characteristic of text\ndata. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed attacking strategy is\nnot only effective, but more importantly, hard to defend due to its triggerless\nand clean-labeled nature.

Goal-images describing a desired\nscene configuration are a promising and increasingly used mode of instruction.\nA key outstanding challenge is the accurate inference of matches between\nobjects in front of a robot, and those seen in a provided goal image, where\nrecent works have struggled in the absence of object-specific training data. In\nthis work, we explore the deterioration of existing methods' ability to infer\nmatches between objects as the visual shift between observed and goal scenes\nincreases.

In the companion paper [Global\nConvergence of Shifted QR II: Numerical Stability and Deflation], we show that\nour shifting strategies can be implemented efficiently in finite arithmetic.",

    "abstract": "The central open question in Descriptive Complexity is whether there is a\nlogic that characterizes deterministic polynomial time (PTIME) on relational\nstructures. Towards this goal, we define a logic that is obtained from\nfirst-order logic with fixed points, FO(FP), by a series of transformations\nthat include restricting logical connectives and adding a dynamic version of\nHilbert's Choice operator Epsilon. The formalism can be viewed, simultaneously,\nas an algebra of binary relations and as a linear-time modal dynamic logic,\nwhere algebraic expressions describing ``proofs'' or ``programs'' appear inside\nthe modalities. We show how counting, reachability and ``mixed'' examples (that\ninclude linear equations modulo two) are axiomatized in the logic, and how an\narbitrary PTIME Turing machine can be encoded. For each fixed Choice function,\nthe data complexity of model checking is in PTIME. However, there can be\nexponentially many such functions. A crucial question is under what syntactic\nconditions on algebraic terms checking just one Choice function is sufficient.\nAnswering this question requires a study of symmetries among computations. This\npaper sets mathematical foundations towards such a study via algebraic and\nautomata-theoretic techniques.",

    "abstract": "We describe a novel metric-based learning approach that introduces a\nmultimodal framework and uses deep audio and geophone encoders in siamese\nconfiguration to design an adaptable and lightweight supervised model. This\nframework eliminates the need for expensive data labeling procedures and learns\ngeneral-purpose representations from low multisensory data obtained from\nomnipresent sensing systems. These sensing systems provide numerous\napplications and various use cases in activity recognition tasks. Here, we\nintend to explore the human footstep movements from indoor environments and\nanalyze representations from a small self-collected dataset of acoustic and\nvibration-based sensors. The core idea is to learn plausible similarities\nbetween two sensory traits and combining representations from audio and\ngeophone signals. We present a generalized framework to learn embeddings from\ntemporal and spatial features extracted from audio and geophone signals. We\nthen extract the representations in a shared space to maximize the learning of\na compatibility function between acoustic and geophone features. This, in turn,\ncan be used effectively to carry out a classification task from the learned\nmodel, as demonstrated by assigning high similarity to the pairs with a human\nfootstep movement and lower similarity to pairs containing no footstep\nmovement. Performance analyses show that our proposed multimodal framework\nachieves a 19.99\\% accuracy increase (in absolute terms) and avoided\noverfitting on the evaluation set when the training samples were increased from\n200 pairs to just 500 pairs while satisfactorily learning the audio and\ngeophone representations. Our results employ a metric-based contrastive\nlearning approach for multi-sensor data to mitigate the impact of data scarcity\nand perform human movement identification with limited data size.",

We disentangle what is annotated as toxic by considering posts with three\ncharacteristics: anti-Black language, African American English (AAE) dialect,\nand vulgarity. Our results show strong associations between annotator identity\nand beliefs and their ratings of toxicity. Notably, more conservative\nannotators and those who scored highly on our scale for racist beliefs were\nless likely to rate anti-Black language as toxic, but more likely to rate AAE\nas toxic.

    "abstract": "Skill chaining is a promising approach for synthesizing complex behaviors by\nsequentially combining previously learned skills. Yet, a naive composition of\nskills fails when a policy encounters a starting state never seen during its\ntraining. For successful skill chaining, prior approaches attempt to widen the\npolicy's starting state distribution. However, these approaches require larger\nstate distributions to be covered as more policies are sequenced, and thus are\nlimited to short skill sequences. In this paper, we propose to chain multiple\npolicies without excessively large initial state distributions by regularizing\nthe terminal state distributions in an adversarial learning framework. We\nevaluate our approach on two complex long-horizon manipulation tasks of\nfurniture assembly. Our results have shown that our method establishes the\nfirst model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to solve these tasks; whereas\nprior skill chaining approaches fail.

Although the benefits of using digital mammography for cancer\nscreening outweigh the risks associated with the x-ray exposure, the radiation\ndose must be kept as low as possible while maintaining the diagnostic utility\nof the generated images, thus minimizing patient risks. Many studies\ninvestigated the feasibility of dose reduction by restoring low-dose images\nusing deep neural networks. In these cases, choosing the appropriate training\ndatabase and loss function is crucial and impacts the quality of the results.\nIn this work, a modification of the ResNet architecture, with hierarchical skip\nconnections, is proposed to restore low-dose digital mammography. We compared\nthe restored images to the standard full-dose images. Moreover, we evaluated\nthe performance of several loss functions for this task. For training purposes,\nwe extracted 256,000 image patches from a dataset of 400 images of\nretrospective clinical mammography exams, where different dose levels were\nsimulated to generate low and standard-dose pairs. To validate the network in a\nreal scenario, a physical anthropomorphic breast phantom was used to acquire\nreal low-dose and standard full-dose images in a commercially avaliable\nmammography system, which were then processed through our trained model. An\nanalytical restoration model for low-dose digital mammography, previously\npresented, was used as a benchmark in this work. Objective assessment was\nperformed through the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and mean normalized squared\nerror (MNSE), decomposed into residual noise and bias. Results showed that the\nperceptual loss function (PL4) is able to achieve virtually the same noise\nlevels of a full-dose acquisition, while resulting in smaller signal bias\ncompared to other loss functions.",

A prominent\nframework for addressing such control problems is Optimal Feedback Control\n(OFC). OFC generates control actions that optimize behaviorally relevant\ncriteria by integrating noisy sensory stimuli and the predictions of an\ninternal model using the Kalman filter or its extensions. However, a\nsatisfactory neural model of Kalman filtering and control is lacking because\nexisting proposals have the following limitations: not considering the delay of\nsensory feedback, training in alternating phases, and requiring knowledge of\nthe noise covariance matrices, as well as that of systems dynamics. Moreover,\nthe majority of these studies considered Kalman filtering in isolation, and not\njointly with control. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel\nonline algorithm which combines adaptive Kalman filtering with a model free\ncontrol approach (i.e., policy gradient algorithm). We implement this algorithm\nin a biologically plausible neural network with local synaptic plasticity\nrules. This network performs system identification and Kalman filtering,\nwithout the need for multiple phases with distinct update rules or the\nknowledge of the noise covariances. It can perform state estimation with\ndelayed sensory feedback, with the help of an internal model. It learns the\ncontrol policy without requiring any knowledge of the dynamics, thus avoiding\nthe need for weight transport. In this way, our implementation of OFC solves\nthe credit assignment problem needed to produce the appropriate sensory-motor\ncontrol in the presence of stimulus delay.",

Whilst there exist many attempts to generalise the conditions for LLL\nreduction to such lattices, there do not seem to be any attempts so far to\ngeneralise stronger notions of reduction such as Minkowski, HKZ and BKZ\nreduction. Moreover, most lattice reduction methods for modules over algebraic\nrings involve applying traditional techniques to the embedding of the module\ninto real space, which distorts the structure of the algebra. In this paper, we\ngeneralise some classical notions of reduction theory to that of free modules\ndefined over an order. Moreover, we extend the definitions of Minkowski, HKZ\nand BKZ reduction to that of such modules and show that bases reduced in this\nmanner have vector lengths that can be bounded above by the successive minima\nof the lattice multiplied by a constant that depends on the algebra and the\ndimension of the module.

In this work, we combine innovations\nfrom these areas to tackle the problem of N-k security-constrained optimal\npower flow (SCOPF). N-k SCOPF is a core problem for the operation of electrical\ngrids, and aims to schedule power generation in a manner that is robust to\npotentially k simultaneous equipment outages. Inspired by methods in\nadversarially robust training, we frame N-k SCOPF as a minimax optimization\nproblem - viewing power generation settings as adjustable parameters and\nequipment outages as (adversarial) attacks - and solve this problem via\ngradient-based techniques. The loss function of this minimax problem involves\nresolving implicit equations representing grid physics and operational\ndecisions, which we differentiate through via the implicit function theorem. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our framework in solving N-3 SCOPF, which has\ntraditionally been considered as prohibitively expensive to solve given that\nthe problem size depends combinatorially on the number of potential outages.",

    "abstract": "One of the main challenges for hierarchical clustering is how to\nappropriately identify the representative points in the lower level of the\ncluster tree, which are going to be utilized as the roots in the higher level\nof the cluster tree for further aggregation. However, conventional hierarchical\nclustering approaches have adopted some simple tricks to select the\n\"representative\" points which might not be as representative as enough. Thus,\nthe constructed cluster tree is less attractive in terms of its poor robustness\nand weak reliability. Aiming at this issue, we propose a novel hierarchical\nclustering algorithm, in which, while building the clustering dendrogram, we\ncan effectively detect the representative point based on scoring the reciprocal\nnearest data points in each sub-minimum-spanning-tree. Extensive experiments on\nUCI datasets show that the proposed algorithm is more accurate than other\nbenchmarks. Meanwhile, under our analysis, the proposed algorithm has O(nlogn)\ntime-complexity and O(logn) space-complexity, indicating that it has the\nscalability in handling massive data with less time and storage consumptions.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial examples are often cited by neuroscientists and machine learning\nresearchers as an example of how computational models diverge from biological\nsensory systems. Recent work has proposed adding biologically-inspired\ncomponents to visual neural networks as a way to improve their adversarial\nrobustness. One surprisingly effective component for reducing adversarial\nvulnerability is response stochasticity, like that exhibited by biological\nneurons. Here, using recently developed geometrical techniques from\ncomputational neuroscience, we investigate how adversarial perturbations\ninfluence the internal representations of standard, adversarially trained, and\nbiologically-inspired stochastic networks. We find distinct geometric\nsignatures for each type of network, revealing different mechanisms for\nachieving robust representations. Next, we generalize these results to the\nauditory domain, showing that neural stochasticity also makes auditory models\nmore robust to adversarial perturbations. Geometric analysis of the stochastic\nnetworks reveals overlap between representations of clean and adversarially\nperturbed stimuli, and quantitatively demonstrates that competing geometric\neffects of stochasticity mediate a tradeoff between adversarial and clean\nperformance. Our results shed light on the strategies of robust perception\nutilized by adversarially trained and stochastic networks, and help explain how\nstochasticity may be beneficial to machine and biological computation.",

    "abstract": "Quantum error correction has recently been shown to benefit greatly from\nspecific physical encodings of the code qubits. In particular, several\nresearchers have considered the individual code qubits being encoded with the\ncontinuous variable GottesmanKitaev-Preskill (GKP) code, and then imposed an\nouter discrete-variable code such as the surface code on these GKP qubits.\nUnder such a concatenation scheme, the analog information from the inner GKP\nerror correction improves the noise threshold of the outer code. However, the\nsurface code has vanishing rate and demands a lot of resources with growing\ndistance. In this work, we concatenate the GKP code with generic quantum\nlow-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes and demonstrate a natural way to exploit\nthe GKP analog information in iterative decoding algorithms. We first show the\nnoise thresholds for two lifted product QLDPC code families, and then show the\nimprovements of noise thresholds when the iterative decoder - a\nhardware-friendly min-sum algorithm (MSA) - utilizes the GKP analog\ninformation. We also show that, when the GKP analog information is combined\nwith a sequential update schedule for MSA, the scheme surpasses the well-known\nCSS Hamming bound for these code families. Furthermore, we observe that the GKP\nanalog information helps the iterative decoder in escaping harmful trapping\nsets in the Tanner graph of the QLDPC code, thereby eliminating or\nsignificantly lowering the error floor of the logical error rate curves.\nFinally, we discuss new fundamental and practical questions that arise from\nthis work on channel capacity under GKP analog information, and on improving\ndecoder design and analysis.",

Using precise high-dimensional asymptotics, we characterize the\ndynamics of the fitted model in two \"worlds\": in the Oracle World the model is\ntrained on the population distribution and in the Empirical World the model is\ntrained on a sampled dataset. We show that under mild conditions on the kernel\nand $L^2$ target regression function the training dynamics undergo three stages\ncharacterized by the behaviors of the models in the two worlds.

Deep learning-based image\ndenoising using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has superior performance\nbut often requires additional high-SNR data for supervising the training of\nCNNs, which reduces the practical feasibility. We develop a self-supervised\ndeep learning-based method entitled \"SDnDTI\" for denoising DTI data, which does\nnot require additional high-SNR data for training. Specifically, SDnDTI divides\nmulti-directional DTI data into many subsets, each consisting of six DWI\nvolumes along optimally chosen diffusion-encoding directions that are robust to\nnoise for the tensor fitting, and then synthesizes DWI volumes along all\nacquired directions from the diffusion tensors fitted using each subset of the\ndata as the input data of CNNs.

SDnDTI\nremoves noise from each subset of synthesized DWI volumes using a deep\n3-dimensional CNN to match the quality of the cleaner target DWI volumes and\nachieves even higher SNR by averaging all subsets of denoised data.

One of the important issues that arise is image denoising, which\nmeans recovering a signal from inaccurately and/or partially measured samples.\nThis interpretation is highly correlated to the compressive sensing theory,\nwhich is a revolutionary technology and implies that if a signal is sparse then\nthe original signal can be obtained from a few measured values, which are much\nless, than the ones suggested by other used theories like Shannon's sampling\ntheories. A strong factor in Compressive Sensing (CS) theory to achieve the\nsparsest solution and the noise removal from the corrupted image is the\nselection of the basis dictionary. In this paper, Discrete Cosine Transform\n(DCT) and moment transform (Tchebichef, Krawtchouk) are compared in order to\nachieve image denoising of Gaussian additive white noise based on compressive\nsensing and sparse approximation theory. The experimental results revealed that\nthe basis dictionaries constructed by the moment transform perform\ncompetitively to the traditional DCT. The latter transform shows a higher PSNR\nof 30.82 dB and the same 0.91 SSIM value as the Tchebichef transform.

Finally, a joint demosaicing and HDRI deep\nlearning framework is formalized to include the two novel components and to\nrealize an end-to-end single-shot HDRI. Experiments indicate that the proposed\nend-to-end framework avoids the problem of cumulative errors and surpasses the\nrelated state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that extremely low resolution quantized (nominally 5-state)\nsynapses with large stochastic variations in Domain Wall (DW) position can be\nboth energy efficient and achieve reasonably high testing accuracies compared\nto Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) of similar sizes using floating precision\nsynaptic weights. Specifically, voltage controlled DW devices demonstrate\nstochastic behavior as modeled rigorously with micromagnetic simulations and\ncan only encode limited states; however, they can be extremely energy efficient\nduring both training and inference. We show that by implementing suitable\nmodifications to the learning algorithms, we can address the stochastic\nbehavior as well as mitigate the effect of their low-resolution to achieve high\ntesting accuracies. In this study, we propose both in-situ and ex-situ training\nalgorithms, based on modification of the algorithm proposed by Hubara et al.\n[1] which works well with quantization of synaptic weights. We train several\n5-layer DNNs on MNIST dataset using 2-, 3- and 5-state DW device as synapse.\nFor in-situ training, a separate high precision memory unit is adopted to\npreserve and accumulate the weight gradients, which are then quantized to\nprogram the low precision DW devices. Moreover, a sizeable noise tolerance\nmargin is used during the training to address the intrinsic programming noise.\nFor ex-situ training, a precursor DNN is first trained based on the\ncharacterized DW device model and a noise tolerance margin, which is similar to\nthe in-situ training. Remarkably, for in-situ inference the energy dissipation\nto program the devices is only 13 pJ per inference given that the training is\nperformed over the entire MNIST dataset for 10 epochs.",

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: The Acetabular version, an essential factor in\ntotal hip arthroplasty, is measured by CT scan as the gold standard. The dose\nof radiation and expensiveness of CT make anterior-posterior pelvic radiograph\nan appropriate alternative procedure. In this study, we applied a deep learning\napproach on anteroposterior pelvic X-rays to measure anatomical version,\neliminating the necessity of using Computed tomography scan. Methods: The right\nand left acetabular version angles of the hips of 300 patients are computed\nusing their CT images. The proposed deep learning model, Attention on\nPretrained-VGG16 for Bone Age, is applied to the AP images of the included\npopulation. The age and gender of these people are added as two other inputs to\nthe last fully connected layer of attention mechanism. As the output, the\nangles of both hips are predicted. Results: The angles of hips computed on CT\nincrease as people get older with the mean values of 16.54 and 16.11 (right and\nleft angles) for men and 20.61 and 19.55 for women in our dataset. The\npredicted errors in the estimation of right and left angles using the proposed\nmethod of deep learning are in the accurate region of error (<=3 degrees) which\nshows the ability of the proposed method in measuring anatomical version based\non AP images. Conclusion: The suggested algorithm, applying pre-trained vgg16\non the AP images of the pelvis of patients followed by an attention model\nconsidering age and gender of patients, can assess version accurately using\nonly AP radiographs while obviating the need for CT scan. The applied technique\nof estimation of anatomical acetabular version based on AP pelvic images using\nDL approaches, to the best of authors' knowledge, has not been published yet.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel method for reducing the computational complexity of\nrigorously estimating the partition functions (normalizing constants) of Gibbs\n(Boltzmann) distributions, which arise ubiquitously in probabilistic graphical\nmodels. A major obstacle to practical applications of Gibbs distributions is\nthe need to estimate their partition functions. The state of the art in\naddressing this problem is multi-stage algorithms, which consist of a cooling\nschedule, and a mean estimator in each step of the schedule. While the cooling\nschedule in these algorithms is adaptive, the mean estimation computations use\nMCMC as a black-box to draw approximate samples. We develop a doubly adaptive\napproach, combining the adaptive cooling schedule with an adaptive MCMC mean\nestimator, whose number of Markov chain steps adapts dynamically to the\nunderlying chain. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove that our\nmethod outperforms the state of the art algorithms in several factors: (1) The\ncomputational complexity of our method is smaller; (2) Our method is less\nsensitive to loose bounds on mixing times, an inherent component in these\nalgorithms; and (3) The improvement obtained by our method is particularly\nsignificant in the most challenging regime of high-precision estimation. We\ndemonstrate the advantage of our method in experiments run on classic factor\ngraphs, such as voting models and Ising models.",

In some areas,\nlike natural language processing (NLP), discriminative models have completely\nsupplanted generative models.

In this paper we compare the simple linear-chain CRFs to the\nbasic HMCs.

Focusing on convergence and\nequilibria analysis, a number of new results are provided. First, we show that\nfor networks with generic system parameters, there exist a finite number of\nequilibria. Exploiting monotone systems theory, we further prove that for\nbivirus networks with generic system parameters, then convergence to an\nequilibrium occurs for all initial conditions, except possibly for a set of\nmeasure zero.

    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of estimating the unknown intervention\ntargets in a causal directed acyclic graph from observational and\ninterventional data. The focus is on soft interventions in linear structural\nequation models (SEMs). Current approaches to causal structure learning either\nwork with known intervention targets or use hypothesis testing to discover the\nunknown intervention targets even for linear SEMs. This severely limits their\nscalability and sample complexity. This paper proposes a scalable and efficient\nalgorithm that consistently identifies all intervention targets. The pivotal\nidea is to estimate the intervention sites from the difference between the\nprecision matrices associated with the observational and interventional\ndatasets. It involves repeatedly estimating such sites in different subsets of\nvariables. The proposed algorithm can be used to also update a given\nobservational Markov equivalence class into the interventional Markov\nequivalence class. Consistency, Markov equivalency, and sample complexity are\nestablished analytically. Finally, simulation results on both real and\nsynthetic data demonstrate the gains of the proposed approach for scalable\ncausal structure recovery.

    "abstract": "Impressive progress in neural network-based single-channel speech source\nseparation has been made in recent years. But those improvements have been\nmostly reported on anechoic data, a situation that is hardly met in practice.\nTaking the SepFormer as a starting point, which achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on anechoic mixtures, we gradually modify it to optimize its\nperformance on reverberant mixtures. Although this leads to a word error rate\nimprovement by 8 percentage points compared to the standard SepFormer\nimplementation, the system ends up with only marginally better performance than\nour improved PIT-BLSTM separation system, that is optimized with rather\nstraightforward means. This is surprising and at the same time sobering,\nchallenging the practical usefulness of many improvements reported in recent\nyears for monaural source separation on nonreverberant data.",

    "abstract": "As one of the most important function in quantum networks, entanglement\nrouting, i.e., how to efficiently establish remote entanglement connection\nbetween two arbitrary quantum nodes, becomes a critical problem that is worth\nto be studied. However, the entanglement fidelity, which can be regarded as the\nmost important metric to evaluate the quality of connection, is rarely\nconsidered in existing works. Thus, in this paper, we propose\npurification-enabled entanglement routing designs to provide fidelity guarantee\nfor multiple Source-Destination (S-D) pairs in quantum networks. To find the\nrouting path with minimum entangled pair cost, we first design an iterative\nrouting algorithm for single S-D pair, called Q-PATH, to find the optimal\nsolution. After that, due to the relatively high computational complexity, we\nalso design a low-complexity routing algorithm by using an extended dijkstra\nalgorithm, called Q-LEAP, to efficiently find the near-optimal solution. Based\non these two algorithms, we design a utility metric to solve the resource\nallocation problem for multiple S-D pairs, and further design a greedy-based\nalgorithm considering resource allocation and re-routing process for routing\nrequests from multiple S-D pairs. To verify the effectiveness and superiority\nof the proposed algorithms, extensive simulations are conducted compared to the\nexisting purification-enabled routing algorithm. The simulation results show\nthat, compared with the traditional routing scheme, the proposed algorithms not\nonly can provide fidelity-guaranteed routing solutions under various scenarios,\nbut also has superior performance in terms of throughput, fidelity of\nend-to-end entanglement connection, and resource utilization ratio.",

We demonstrate that\nthere is a ubiquitous nonlinear relationship between time and distance in the\noptimal trajectories within each city.

We found a super-linear\nrelationship for almost all cities in which $\\beta>1.0$.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) applications for wireless communications have gained\nmomentum on the standardization discussions for 5G advanced and beyond. One of\nthe biggest challenges for real world ML deployment is the need for labeled\nsignals and big measurement campaigns. To overcome those problems, we propose\nthe use of untrained neural networks (UNNs) for MIMO channel\nrecreation/estimation and low overhead reporting. The UNNs learn the\npropagation environment by fitting a few channel measurements and we exploit\ntheir learned prior to provide higher channel estimation gains. Moreover, we\npresent a UNN for simultaneous channel recreation for multiple users, or\nmultiple user equipment (UE) positions, in which we have a trade-off between\nthe estimated channel gain and the number of parameters. Our results show that\ntransfer learning techniques are effective in accessing the learned prior on\nthe environment structure as they provide higher channel gain for neighbouring\nusers. Moreover, we indicate how the under-parameterization of UNNs can further\nenable low-overhead channel state information (CSI) reporting.",

    "abstract": "This paper extends Becker (1957)'s outcome test of discrimination to settings\nwhere a (human or algorithmic) decision-maker produces a ranked list of\ncandidates. Ranked lists are particularly relevant in the context of online\nplatforms that produce search results or feeds, and also arise when human\ndecisionmakers express ordinal preferences over a list of candidates. We show\nthat non-discrimination implies a system of moment inequalities, which\nintuitively impose that one cannot permute the position of a lower-ranked\ncandidate from one group with a higher-ranked candidate from a second group and\nsystematically improve the objective. Moreover, we show that that these moment\ninequalities are the only testable implications of non-discrimination when the\nauditor observes only outcomes and group membership by rank. We show how to\nstatistically test the implied inequalities, and validate our approach in an\napplication using data from LinkedIn.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in material data mining has been driven by high-capacity\nmodels trained on large datasets. However, collecting experimental data has\nbeen extremely costly owing to the amount of human effort and expertise\nrequired. Therefore, material researchers are often reluctant to easily\ndisclose their private data, which leads to the problem of data island, and it\nis difficult to collect a large amount of data to train high-quality models. In\nthis study, a material microstructure image feature extraction algorithm\nFedTransfer based on data privacy protection is proposed. The core\ncontributions are as follows: 1) the federated learning algorithm is introduced\ninto the polycrystalline microstructure image segmentation task to make full\nuse of different user data to carry out machine learning, break the data island\nand improve the model generalization ability under the condition of ensuring\nthe privacy and security of user data; 2) A data sharing strategy based on\nstyle transfer is proposed. By sharing style information of images that is not\nurgent for user confidentiality, it can reduce the performance penalty caused\nby the distribution difference of data among different users.",

    "abstract": "In distribution compression, one aims to accurately summarize a probability\ndistribution $\\mathbb{P}$ using a small number of representative points.\nNear-optimal thinning procedures achieve this goal by sampling $n$ points from\na Markov chain and identifying $\\sqrt{n}$ points with\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{n})$ discrepancy to $\\mathbb{P}$.\nUnfortunately, these algorithms suffer from quadratic or super-quadratic\nruntime in the sample size $n$. To address this deficiency, we introduce\nCompress++, a simple meta-procedure for speeding up any thinning algorithm\nwhile suffering at most a factor of $4$ in error. When combined with the\nquadratic-time kernel halving and kernel thinning algorithms of Dwivedi and\nMackey (2021), Compress++ delivers $\\sqrt{n}$ points with\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\log n/n})$ integration error and better-than-Monte-Carlo\nmaximum mean discrepancy in $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log^3 n)$ time and $\\mathcal{O}(\n\\sqrt{n} \\log^2 n )$ space. Moreover, Compress++ enjoys the same near-linear\nruntime given any quadratic-time input and reduces the runtime of\nsuper-quadratic algorithms by a square-root factor. In our benchmarks with\nhigh-dimensional Monte Carlo samples and Markov chains targeting challenging\ndifferential equation posteriors, Compress++ matches or nearly matches the\naccuracy of its input algorithm in orders of magnitude less time.",

    "abstract": "Optimization of parameterized quantum circuits is indispensable for\napplications of near-term quantum devices to computational tasks with\nvariational quantum algorithms (VQAs). However, the existing optimization\nalgorithms for VQAs require an excessive number of quantum-measurement shots in\nestimating expectation values of observables or iterating updates of circuit\nparameters, whose cost has been a crucial obstacle for practical use. To\naddress this problem, we develop an efficient framework, \\textit{stochastic\ngradient line Bayesian optimization} (SGLBO), for the circuit optimization with\nfewer measurement shots. The SGLBO reduces the cost of measurement shots by\nestimating an appropriate direction of updating the parameters based on\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) and further by utilizing Bayesian\noptimization (BO) to estimate the optimal step size in each iteration of the\nSGD. We formulate an adaptive measurement-shot strategy to achieve the\noptimization feasibly without relying on precise expectation-value estimation\nand many iterations; moreover, we show that a technique of suffix averaging can\nsignificantly reduce the effect of statistical and hardware noise in the\noptimization for the VQAs. Our numerical simulation demonstrates that the SGLBO\naugmented with these techniques can drastically reduce the required number of\nmeasurement shots, improve the accuracy in the optimization, and enhance the\nrobustness against the noise compared to other state-of-art optimizers in\nrepresentative tasks for the VQAs. These results establish a framework of\nquantum-circuit optimizers integrating two different optimization approaches,\nSGD and BO, to reduce the cost of measurement shots significantly.",
