    "abstract": "We investigate non-adaptive methods of deep ReLU neural network approximation\nof the solution $u$ to parametric and stochastic elliptic PDEs with lognormal\ninputs on non-compact set $\\mathbb{R}^\\infty$. The approximation error is\nmeasured in the norm of the Bochner space $L_2(\\mathbb{R}^\\infty, V, \\gamma)$,\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the tensor product standard Gaussian probability on\n$\\mathbb{R}^\\infty$ and $V$ is the energy space. The approximation is based on\nan $m$-term truncation of the Hermite generalized polynomial chaos expansion\n(gpc) of $u$. Under a certain assumption on $\\ell_q$-summability condition for\nlognormal inputs ($0< q <\\infty$), we proved that for every integer $n > 1$,\none can construct a non-adaptive compactly supported deep ReLU neural network\n$\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_n$ of size not greater than $n$ on $\\mathbb{R}^m$ with $m =\n\\mathcal{O} (n/\\log n)$, having $m$ outputs so that the summation constituted\nby replacing polynomials in the $m$-term truncation of Hermite gpc expansion by\nthese $m$ outputs approximates $u$ with an error bound\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\left(n/\\log n\\right)^{-1/q}\\right)$. This error bound is\ncomparable to the error bound of the best approximation of $u$ by $n$-term\ntruncations of Hermite gpc expansion which is $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/q})$. We also\nobtained some results on similar problems for parametric and stochastic\nelliptic PDEs with affine inputs, based on the Jacobi and Taylor gpc\nexpansions.",

    "title": "Search in Imperfect Information Games",
    "abstract": "From the very dawn of the field, search with value functions was a\nfundamental concept of computer games research. Turing's chess algorithm from\n1950 was able to think two moves ahead, and Shannon's work on chess from $1950$\nincludes an extensive section on evaluation functions to be used within a\nsearch. Samuel's checkers program from 1959 already combines search and value\nfunctions that are learned through self-play and bootstrapping. TD-Gammon\nimproves upon those ideas and uses neural networks to learn those complex value\nfunctions -- only to be again used within search. The combination of\ndecision-time search and value functions has been present in the remarkable\nmilestones where computers bested their human counterparts in long standing\nchallenging games -- DeepBlue for Chess and AlphaGo for Go. Until recently,\nthis powerful framework of search aided with (learned) value functions has been\nlimited to perfect information games. As many interesting problems do not\nprovide the agent perfect information of the environment, this was an\nunfortunate limitation. This thesis introduces the reader to sound search for\nimperfect information games.",

Existing works on multimodal emotion recognition are using\nbulky approach, where pretrained neural networks are used as a feature\nextractors and then extracted features are being fused. However, this approach\ndoes not consider attributes of multimodal data and feature extractors cannot\nbe fine-tuned for specific task which can be disadvantageous for overall model\naccuracy. To this end, our impact is twofold: (i) we train model end-to-end,\nwhich allows early layers of neural network to be adapted with taking into\naccount later, fusion layers, of two modalities; (ii) all layers of our model\nwas fine-tuned for downstream task of emotion recognition, so there were no\nneed to train neural networks from scratch.

    "abstract": "Deep learning based models have dominated the current landscape of production\nrecommender systems. Furthermore, recent years have witnessed an exponential\ngrowth of the model scale--from Google's 2016 model with 1 billion parameters\nto the latest Facebook's model with 12 trillion parameters. Significant quality\nboost has come with each jump of the model capacity, which makes us believe the\nera of 100 trillion parameters is around the corner. However, the training of\nsuch models is challenging even within industrial scale data centers. This\ndifficulty is inherited from the staggering heterogeneity of the training\ncomputation--the model's embedding layer could include more than 99.99% of the\ntotal model size, which is extremely memory-intensive; while the rest neural\nnetwork is increasingly computation-intensive. To support the training of such\nhuge models, an efficient distributed training system is in urgent need. In\nthis paper, we resolve this challenge by careful co-design of both the\noptimization algorithm and the distributed system architecture. Specifically,\nin order to ensure both the training efficiency and the training accuracy, we\ndesign a novel hybrid training algorithm, where the embedding layer and the\ndense neural network are handled by different synchronization mechanisms; then\nwe build a system called Persia (short for parallel recommendation training\nsystem with hybrid acceleration) to support this hybrid training algorithm.\nBoth theoretical demonstration and empirical study up to 100 trillion\nparameters have conducted to justified the system design and implementation of\nPersia. We make Persia publicly available (at\nhttps://github.com/PersiaML/Persia) so that anyone would be able to easily\ntrain a recommender model at the scale of 100 trillion parameters.",

    "abstract": "Dyck reachability is the standard formulation of a large domain of static\nanalyses, as it achieves the sweet spot between precision and efficiency, and\nhas thus been studied extensively. Interleaved Dyck reachability (denoted\n$D_k\\odot D_k$) uses two Dyck languages for increased precision (e.g., context\nand field sensitivity) but is well-known to be undecidable. As many static\nanalyses yield a certain type of bidirected graphs, they give rise to\ninterleaved bidirected Dyck reachability problems. Although these problems have\nseen numerous applications, their decidability and complexity has largely\nremained open. In a recent work, Li et al. made the first steps in this\ndirection, showing that (i) $D_1\\odot D_1$ reachability (i.e., when both Dyck\nlanguages are over a single parenthesis and act as counters) is computable in\n$O(n^7)$ time, while (ii) $D_k\\odot D_k$ reachability is NP-hard.\nIn this work we address the decidability and complexity of all variants of\ninterleaved bidirected Dyck reachability. First, we show that $D_1\\odot D_1$\nreachability can be computed in $O(n^3\\cdot \\alpha(n))$ time, significantly\nimproving over the existing $O(n^7)$ bound. Second, we show that $D_k\\odot D_1$\nreachability (i.e., when one language acts as a counter) is decidable, in\ncontrast to the non-bidirected case where decidability is open. We further\nconsider $D_k\\odot D_1$ reachability where the counter remains linearly\nbounded. Our third result shows that this bounded variant can be solved in\n$O(n^2\\cdot \\alpha(n))$ time, while our fourth result shows that the problem\nhas a (conditional) quadratic lower bound, and thus our upper bound is\nessentially optimal. Fifth, we show that full $D_k\\odot D_k$ reachability is\nundecidable. This improves the recent NP-hardness lower-bound, and shows that\nthe problem is equivalent to the non-bidirected case.",

In the past few decades there has been a\nproliferation of acquisition of knowledge and consequently there has been an\nexponential growth in new scientific articles in the field of biomedicine.\nTherefore, it has become difficult to keep track of all the information in the\ndomain, even for domain experts. With the improvements in commercial search\nengines, users can type in their queries and get a small set of documents most\nrelevant for answering their query, as well as relevant snippets from the\ndocuments in some cases. However, it may be still tedious and time consuming to\nmanually look for the required information or answers. This has necessitated\nthe development of efficient QA systems which aim to find exact and precise\nanswers to user provided natural language questions in the domain of\nbiomedicine. In this paper, we introduce the basic methodologies used for\ndeveloping general domain QA systems, followed by a thorough investigation of\ndifferent aspects of biomedical QA systems, including benchmark datasets and\nseveral proposed approaches, both using structured databases and collection of\ntexts. We also explore the limitations of current systems and explore potential\navenues for further advancement.",

    "abstract": "Presently with technology node scaling, an accurate prediction model at early\ndesign stages can significantly reduce the design cycle. Especially during\nlogic synthesis, predicting cell congestion due to improper logic combination\ncan reduce the burden of subsequent physical implementations. There have been\nattempts using Graph Neural Network (GNN) techniques to tackle congestion\nprediction during the logic synthesis stage. However, they require informative\ncell features to achieve reasonable performance since the core idea of GNNs is\nbuilt on the message passing framework, which would be impractical at the early\nlogic synthesis stage. To address this limitation, we propose a framework that\ncan directly learn embeddings for the given netlist to enhance the quality of\nour node features. Popular random-walk based embedding methods such as\nNode2vec, LINE, and DeepWalk suffer from the issue of cross-graph alignment and\npoor generalization to unseen netlist graphs, yielding inferior performance and\ncosting significant runtime. In our framework, we introduce a superior\nalternative to obtain node embeddings that can generalize across netlist graphs\nusing matrix factorization methods. We propose an efficient mini-batch training\nmethod at the sub-graph level that can guarantee parallel training and satisfy\nthe memory restriction for large-scale netlists. We present results utilizing\nopen-source EDA tools such as DREAMPLACE and OPENROAD frameworks on a variety\nof openly available circuits.

Over-consumption of services and\nproducts leads to potential natural resource exhaustion and societal\ninequalities, as access to goods and services becomes more challenging. In\neveryday life, a person can simply achieve more sustainable purchases by\ndrastically changing their lifestyle choices and potentially going against\ntheir personal values or wishes. Conversely, achieving sustainable consumption\nwhile accounting for personal values is a more complex task, as potential\ntrade-offs arise when trying to satisfy environmental and personal goals. This\narticle focuses on value-sensitive design of recommender systems, which enable\nconsumers to improve the sustainability of their purchases while respecting\ntheir personal values. Value-sensitive recommendations for sustainable\nconsumption are formalized as a multi-objective optimization problem, where\neach objective represents different sustainability goals and personal values.\nNovel and existing multi-objective algorithms calculate solutions to this\nproblem. The solutions are proposed as personalized sustainable basket\nrecommendations to consumers. These recommendations are evaluated on a\nsynthetic dataset, which comprises three established real-world datasets from\nrelevant scientific and organizational reports. The synthetic dataset contains\nquantitative data on product prices, nutritional values and environmental\nimpact metrics, such as greenhouse gas emissions and water footprint.

    "abstract": "Metamaterials are composite materials with engineered geometrical micro- and\nmeso-structures that can lead to uncommon physical properties, like negative\nPoisson's ratio or ultra-low shear resistance. Periodic metamaterials are\ncomposed of repeating unit-cells, and geometrical patterns within these\nunit-cells influence the propagation of elastic or acoustic waves and control\ndispersion. In this work, we develop a new interpretable, multi-resolution\nmachine learning framework for finding patterns in the unit-cells of materials\nthat reveal their dynamic properties. Specifically, we propose two new\ninterpretable representations of metamaterials, called shape-frequency features\nand unit-cell templates. Machine learning models built using these feature\nclasses can accurately predict dynamic material properties. These feature\nrepresentations (particularly the unit-cell templates) have a useful property:\nthey can operate on designs of higher resolutions. By learning key coarse scale\npatterns that can be reliably transferred to finer resolution design space via\nthe shape-frequency features or unit-cell templates, we can almost freely\ndesign the fine resolution features of the unit-cell without changing coarse\nscale physics. Through this multi-resolution approach, we are able to design\nmaterials that possess target frequency ranges in which waves are allowed or\ndisallowed to propagate (frequency bandgaps). Our approach yields major\nbenefits: (1) unlike typical machine learning approaches to materials science,\nour models are interpretable, (2) our approaches leverage multi-resolution\nproperties, and (3) our approach provides design flexibility.",

In such studies the\ncurvature-driven motion of interface is neglected in the Gibbs-Thomson\ncondition. In order to simulate those phenomena with or without\ncurvature-driven motion, we propose a phase-field model which is derived from a\nthermodynamic functional of grand-potential. Compared to the well-known free\nenergy, the main advantage of the grand-potential is to provide a theoretical\nframework which is consistent with the equilibrium properties such as the\nequality of chemical potentials. The model is composed of one equation for the\nphase-field {\\phi} coupled with one equation for the chemical potential {\\mu}.\nIn the phase-field method, the curvature-driven motion is always contained in\nthe phase-field equation. For canceling it, a counter term must be added in the\n{\\phi}-equation. For reason of mass conservation, the {\\mu}-equation is written\nwith a mixed formulation which involves the composition c and the chemical\npotential. The closure relationship between c and {\\mu} is derived by assuming\nquadratic free energies of bulk phases. The anti-trapping current is also\nconsidered in the composition equation for simulations with null diffusion in\nsolid. The lattice Boltzmann schemes are implemented in LBM_saclay, a numerical\ncode running on various High Performance Computing architectures.

    "abstract": "With deep learning models rapidly growing in size, systems-level solutions\nfor large-model training are required. We present Amazon SageMaker model\nparallelism, a software library that integrates with PyTorch, and enables easy\ntraining of large models using model parallelism and other memory-saving\nfeatures. In contrast to existing solutions, the implementation of the\nSageMaker library is much more generic and flexible, in that it can\nautomatically partition and run pipeline parallelism over arbitrary model\narchitectures with minimal code change, and also offers a general and\nextensible framework for tensor parallelism, which supports a wider range of\nuse cases, and is modular enough to be easily applied to new training scripts.\nThe library also preserves the native PyTorch user experience to a much larger\ndegree, supporting module re-use and dynamic graphs, while giving the user full\ncontrol over the details of the training step. We evaluate performance over\nGPT-3, RoBERTa, BERT, and neural collaborative filtering, and demonstrate\ncompetitive performance over existing solutions.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of AI technology in recent years, there have been\nmany studies with deep learning models in soft sensing area. However, the\nmodels have become more complex, yet, the data sets remain limited: researchers\nare fitting million-parameter models with hundreds of data samples, which is\ninsufficient to exercise the effectiveness of their models and thus often fail\nto perform when implemented in industrial applications. To solve this\nlong-lasting problem, we are providing large scale, high dimensional time\nseries manufacturing sensor data from Seagate Technology to the public. We\ndemonstrate the challenges and effectiveness of modeling industrial big data by\na Soft Sensing Transformer model on these data sets. Transformer is used\nbecause, it has outperformed state-of-the-art techniques in Natural Language\nProcessing, and since then has also performed well in the direct application to\ncomputer vision without introduction of image-specific inductive biases. We\nobserve the similarity of a sentence structure to the sensor readings and\nprocess the multi-variable sensor readings in a time series in a similar manner\nof sentences in natural language. The high-dimensional time-series data is\nformatted into the same shape of embedded sentences and fed into the\ntransformer model. The results show that transformer model outperforms the\nbenchmark models in soft sensing field based on auto-encoder and long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) models. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first\nteam in academia or industry to benchmark the performance of original\ntransformer model with large-scale numerical soft sensing data.",

In this work, we propose a novel method of real-time\nvideo stabilization - transforming a shaky video to a stabilized video as if it\nwere stabilized via gimbals in real-time. Our framework is trainable in a\nself-supervised manner, which does not require data captured with special\nhardware setups (i.e., two cameras on a stereo rig or additional motion\nsensors). Our framework consists of a transformation estimator between given\nframes for global stability adjustments, followed by scene parallax reduction\nmodule via spatially smoothed optical flow for further stability. Then, a\nmargin inpainting module fills in the missing margin regions created during\nstabilization to reduce the amount of post-cropping. These sequential steps\nreduce distortion and margin cropping to a minimum while enhancing stability.\nHence, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art real-time video stabilization\nmethods as well as offline methods that require camera trajectory optimization.\nOur method procedure takes approximately 24.3 ms yielding 41 fps regardless of\nresolution (e.g., 480p or 1080p).",

The aim is to build a machine learning model for\npredicting the normalized average traffic speed and flow of the subregions of\nmultiple large-scale cities using historical data points. The model is supposed\nto be generic, in a way that it can be applied to new cities. By considering\nspatiotemporal feature learning and modeling efficiency, we explore 3DResNet\nand Sparse-UNet approaches for the tasks in this competition. The 3DResNet\nbased models use 3D convolution to learn the spatiotemporal features and apply\nsequential convolutional layers to enhance the temporal relationship of the\noutputs. The Sparse-UNet model uses sparse convolutions as the backbone for\nspatiotemporal feature learning. Since the latter algorithm mainly focuses on\nnon-zero data points of the inputs, it dramatically reduces the computation\ntime, while maintaining a competitive accuracy.

    "abstract": "The creation and destruction of agents in cooperative multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) is a critically under-explored area of research.\nCurrent MARL algorithms often assume that the number of agents within a group\nremains fixed throughout an experiment. However, in many practical problems, an\nagent may terminate before their teammates. This early termination issue\npresents a challenge: the terminated agent must learn from the group's success\nor failure which occurs beyond its own existence. We refer to propagating value\nfrom rewards earned by remaining teammates to terminated agents as the\nPosthumous Credit Assignment problem. Current MARL methods handle this problem\nby placing these agents in an absorbing state until the entire group of agents\nreaches a termination condition. Although absorbing states enable existing\nalgorithms and APIs to handle terminated agents without modification, practical\ntraining efficiency and resource use problems exist.\nIn this work, we first demonstrate that sample complexity increases with the\nquantity of absorbing states in a toy supervised learning task for a fully\nconnected network, while attention is more robust to variable size input. Then,\nwe present a novel architecture for an existing state-of-the-art MARL algorithm\nwhich uses attention instead of a fully connected layer with absorbing states.\nFinally, we demonstrate that this novel architecture significantly outperforms\nthe standard architecture on tasks in which agents are created or destroyed\nwithin episodes as well as standard multi-agent coordination tasks.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Daskalakis, Fishelson, and Golowich (DFG) (NeurIPS`21) showed that\nif all agents in a multi-player general-sum normal-form game employ Optimistic\nMultiplicative Weights Update (OMWU), the external regret of every player is\n$O(\\textrm{polylog}(T))$ after $T$ repetitions of the game. We extend their\nresult from external regret to internal regret and swap regret, thereby\nestablishing uncoupled learning dynamics that converge to an approximate\ncorrelated equilibrium at the rate of $\\tilde{O}(T^{-1})$. This substantially\nimproves over the prior best rate of convergence for correlated equilibria of\n$O(T^{-3/4})$ due to Chen and Peng (NeurIPS`20), and it is optimal -- within\nthe no-regret framework -- up to polylogarithmic factors in $T$.\nTo obtain these results, we develop new techniques for establishing\nhigher-order smoothness for learning dynamics involving fixed point operations.\nSpecifically, we establish that the no-internal-regret learning dynamics of\nStoltz and Lugosi (Mach Learn`05) are equivalently simulated by\nno-external-regret dynamics on a combinatorial space. This allows us to trade\nthe computation of the stationary distribution on a polynomial-sized Markov\nchain for a (much more well-behaved) linear transformation on an\nexponential-sized set, enabling us to leverage similar techniques as DGF to\nnear-optimally bound the internal regret.\nMoreover, we establish an $O(\\textrm{polylog}(T))$ no-swap-regret bound for\nthe classic algorithm of Blum and Mansour (BM) (JMLR`07). We do so by\nintroducing a technique based on the Cauchy Integral Formula that circumvents\nthe more limited combinatorial arguments of DFG. In addition to shedding\nclarity on the near-optimal regret guarantees of BM, our arguments provide\ninsights into the various ways in which the techniques by DFG can be extended\nand leveraged in the analysis of more involved learning algorithms.",

    "title": "Low Complexity Channel Estimation for OTFS Modulation with Fractional  Delay and Doppler",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of accurate channel estimation for OTFS based systems\nwith few transmit/receive antennas, where additional sparsity due to large\nnumber of antennas is not a possibility. For such systems the sparsity of the\neffective delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel is adversely affected in the\npresence of channel path delay and Doppler shifts which are non-integer\nmultiples of the delay and Doppler domain resolution. The sparsity is also\nadversely affected when practical transmit and receive pulses are used. In this\npaper we propose a Modified Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimation (M-MLE)\nmethod for OTFS based systems which exploits the fine delay and Doppler domain\nresolution of the OTFS modulated signal to decouple the joint estimation of the\nchannel parameters (i.e., channel gain, delay and Doppler shift) of all channel\npaths into separate estimation of the channel parameters for each path. We\nfurther observe that with fine delay and Doppler domain resolution, the\nreceived DD domain signal along a particular channel path can be written as a\nproduct of a delay domain term and a Doppler domain term where the delay domain\nterm is primarily dependent on the delay of this path and the Doppler domain\nterm is primarily dependent on the Doppler shift of this path. This allows us\nto propose another method termed as the two-step method (TSE), where the joint\ntwo-dimensional estimation of the delay and Doppler shift of a particular path\nin the M-MLE method is further decoupled into two separate one-dimensional\nestimation for the delay and for the Doppler shift of that path. Simulations\nreveal that the proposed methods (M-MLE and TSE) achieve better channel\nestimation accuracy at lower complexity when compared to other known methods\nfor accurate OTFS channel estimation.",

    "abstract": "Owing to the remarkable development of deep learning technology, there have\nbeen a series of efforts to build deep learning-based climate models. Whereas\nmost of them utilize recurrent neural networks and/or graph neural networks, we\ndesign a novel climate model based on the two concepts, the neural ordinary\ndifferential equation (NODE) and the diffusion equation. Many physical\nprocesses involving a Brownian motion of particles can be described by the\ndiffusion equation and as a result, it is widely used for modeling climate. On\nthe other hand, neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) are to learn a\nlatent governing equation of ODE from data. In our presented method, we combine\nthem into a single framework and propose a concept, called neural diffusion\nequation (NDE). Our NDE, equipped with the diffusion equation and one more\nadditional neural network to model inherent uncertainty, can learn an\nappropriate latent governing equation that best describes a given climate\ndataset. In our experiments with two real-world and one synthetic datasets and\neleven baselines, our method consistently outperforms existing baselines by\nnon-trivial margins.",

    "abstract": "Multi-task learning is useful in NLP because it is often practically\ndesirable to have a single model that works across a range of tasks. In the\nmedical domain, sequential training on tasks may sometimes be the only way to\ntrain models, either because access to the original (potentially sensitive)\ndata is no longer available, or simply owing to the computational costs\ninherent to joint retraining. A major issue inherent to sequential learning,\nhowever, is catastrophic forgetting, i.e., a substantial drop in accuracy on\nprior tasks when a model is updated for a new task. Elastic Weight\nConsolidation is a recently proposed method to address this issue, but scaling\nthis approach to the modern large models used in practice requires making\nstrong independence assumptions about model parameters, limiting its\neffectiveness. In this work, we apply Kronecker Factorization--a recent\napproach that relaxes independence assumptions--to prevent catastrophic\nforgetting in convolutional and Transformer-based neural networks at scale. We\nshow the effectiveness of this technique on the important and illustrative task\nof medical entity linking across three datasets, demonstrating the capability\nof the technique to be used to make efficient updates to existing methods as\nnew medical data becomes available. On average, the proposed method reduces\ncatastrophic forgetting by 51% when using a BERT-based model, compared to a 27%\nreduction using standard Elastic Weight Consolidation, while maintaining\nspatial complexity proportional to the number of model parameters.",

    "abstract": "High-Definition (HD) maps can provide precise geometric and semantic\ninformation of static traffic environments for autonomous driving.\nRoad-boundary is one of the most important information contained in HD maps\nsince it distinguishes between road areas and off-road areas, which can guide\nvehicles to drive within road areas. But it is labor-intensive to annotate road\nboundaries for HD maps at the city scale. To enable automatic HD map\nannotation, current work uses semantic segmentation or iterative graph growing\nfor road-boundary detection. However, the former could not ensure topological\ncorrectness since it works at the pixel level, while the latter suffers from\ninefficiency and drifting issues. To provide a solution to the aforementioned\nproblems, in this letter, we propose a novel system termed csBoundary to\nautomatically detect road boundaries at the city scale for HD map annotation.\nOur network takes as input an aerial image patch, and directly infers the\ncontinuous road-boundary graph (i.e., vertices and edges) from this image. To\ngenerate the city-scale road-boundary graph, we stitch the obtained graphs from\nall the image patches. Our csBoundary is evaluated and compared on a public\nbenchmark dataset.

For the close-set representation learning\nwhere labeled data and unlabeled data belong to the same semantic space,\nhowever, FCL cannot show overwhelming gains due to not involving the class\nsemantics during optimization. Consequently, the produced features do not\nguarantee to be easily classified by the class weights learned from labeled\ndata although they are information-rich. To tackle this issue, we propose a\nnovel probability contrastive learning (PCL) in this paper, which not only\nproduces rich features but also enforces them to be distributed around the\nclass prototypes. Specifically, we propose to use the output probabilities\nafter softmax to perform contrastive learning instead of the extracted features\nin FCL. Evidently, such a way can exploit the class semantics during\noptimization. Moreover, we propose to remove the $\\ell_{2}$ normalization in\nthe traditional FCL and directly use the $\\ell_{1}$-normalized probability for\ncontrastive learning.

There have been extensive\nstudies on the statistical and computational approaches to identify (i) whether\na peptide is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) or a non-AMP and (ii) which targets\nare these sequences effective to (Gram-positive, Gram-negative, etc.). Despite\nthe existing deep learning methods on this problem, most of them are unable to\nhandle the small AMP classes (anti-insect, anti-parasite, etc.). And more\nimportantly, some AMPs can have multiple targets, which the previous methods\nfail to consider. In this study, we build a diverse and comprehensive\nmulti-label protein sequence database by collecting and cleaning amino acids\nfrom various AMP databases. To generate efficient representations and features\nfor the small classes dataset, we take advantage of a protein language model\ntrained on 250 million protein sequences. Based on that, we develop an\nend-to-end hierarchical multi-label deep forest framework, HMD-AMP, to annotate\nAMP comprehensively. After identifying an AMP, it further predicts what targets\nthe AMP can effectively kill from eleven available classes. Extensive\nexperiments suggest that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art models in\nboth the binary classification task and the multi-label classification task,\nespecially on the minor classes.The model is robust against reduced features\nand small perturbations and produces promising results.

    "abstract": "Since its first appearance, transformers have been successfully used in wide\nranging domains from computer vision to natural language processing.\nApplication of transformers in Reinforcement Learning by reformulating it as a\nsequence modelling problem was proposed only recently. Compared to other\ncommonly explored reinforcement learning problems, the Rubiks cube poses a\nunique set of challenges. The Rubiks cube has a single solved state for\nquintillions of possible configurations which leads to extremely sparse\nrewards. The proposed model CubeTR attends to longer sequences of actions and\naddresses the problem of sparse rewards. CubeTR learns how to solve the Rubiks\ncube from arbitrary starting states without any human prior, and after move\nregularisation, the lengths of solutions generated by it are expected to be\nvery close to those given by algorithms used by expert human solvers. CubeTR\nprovides insights to the generalisability of learning algorithms to higher\ndimensional cubes and the applicability of transformers in other relevant\nsparse reward scenarios.",

The input of our problem is a set of items\nwhose states (i.e., the marginal contribution and the cost of an item) are\ndrawn from a known probability distribution. The only way to know the realized\nstate of an item is to select that item. We consider two constraints, i.e.,\n\\emph{inner} and \\emph{outer} constraints. Recall that each item has a\nstate-dependent cost, and the inner constraint states that the total\n\\emph{realized} cost of all selected items must not exceed a give budget. Thus,\ninner constraint is state-dependent. The outer constraint, one the other hand,\nis state-independent. It can be represented as a downward-closed family of sets\nof selected items regardless of their states. Our objective is to maximize the\nobjective function subject to both inner and outer constraints. Under the\nassumption that larger cost indicates larger \"utility\", we present a constant\napproximate solution to this problem.",

Literature reviews have shown that the LM\ncan be very powerful and effective on moderate function approximation problems\nwhen the number of weights in the network is not more than a couple of hundred.\nIn contrast, the LM does not seem to perform as well when dealing with pattern\nrecognition or classification problems, and inefficient when networks become\nlarge (e.g. with more than 500 weights). In this paper, we exploit the true\npower of LM algorithm using some real world aircraft datasets.

The challenging\nnature of the datasets are the abrupt changes in the time series data. We find\nthat the LM optimizer has a much better ability to approximate abrupt changes\nand detect anomalies than other optimizers. We compare the performance, in\naddressing this anomaly/change detection problem, of the LM and several other\noptimizers. We assess the relative performance based on a range of measures\nincluding network complexity (i.e. number of weights), fitting accuracy, over\nfitting, training time, use of GPUs and memory requirement etc. We also discuss\nthe issue of robust LM implementation in MATLAB and Tensorflow for promoting\nmore popular usage of the LM algorithm and potential use of LM optimizer for\nlarge-scale problems.",

TextVQA is a VQA dataset\ngeared towards this problem, where the questions require answering systems to\nread and reason about visual objects and text objects in images. One key\nchallenge in TextVQA is the design of a system that effectively reasons not\nonly about visual and text objects individually, but also about the spatial\nrelationships between these objects.

Some\ncurrent TextVQA models address this problem but either only use categories of\nrelations (rather than edge feature vectors) or do not use edge features within\nthe Transformer architectures.

This work is inspired by the\nobservation of applying the deep learning-based reduced order model (DL-ROM) to\nsolve diffusion-dominant PPDEs. We find that the DL-ROM has a good\napproximation for some special model parameters, but it cannot approximate the\ndrastic changes of the solution as time evolves. Based on this fact, we\nclassify the dataset according to the magnitude of the solutions, and construct\ncorresponding subnets dependent on different types of data. Then we train a\nclassifier to integrate different subnets together to obtain the MC-ROM. When\nsubsets have the same architecture, we can use transfer learning technology to\naccelerate the offline training. Numerical experiments show that the MC-ROM\nimproves the generalization ability of the DL-ROM both for diffusion- and\nconvection-dominant problems, and maintains the advantage of DL-ROM. We also\ncompare the approximation accuracy and computational efficiency of the proper\northogonal decomposition (POD) which is not suitable for convection-dominant\nproblems. For diffusion-dominant problems, the MC-ROM can save about 100 times\nonline computational cost than the POD with a slightly better approximation in\nthe reduced space of the same dimension.",

With this approach, we could obtain\nports frequently observed in fewer days compared to other port access\nactivities. Such access behaviors are not always malicious activities; however,\nsuch information is a good indicator for starting a deeper analysis of traffic\nbehavior. Using a real-life dataset, we could detect two bot-oriented accesses\nand one unique UDP traffic.",

Multi-camera\nsystems help prevent occlusions in open surgery video data. Furthermore,\ncombining multiple views such as a Top-view camera covering the full operative\nfield and a Close-up camera focusing on hand motion and anatomy, may provide a\nmore comprehensive view of the surgical workflow. However, multi-camera data\nfusion poses a new challenge: a tool may be visible in one camera and not the\nother. Thus, we defined the global ground truth as the tools being used\nregardless their visibility. Therefore, tools that are out of the image should\nbe remembered for extensive periods of time while the system responds quickly\nto changes visible in the video.\nMethods: Participants (n=48) performed a simulated open bowel repair. A\nTop-view and a Close-up cameras were used. YOLOv5 was used for tool and hand\ndetection. A high frequency LSTM with a 1 second window at 30 frames per second\n(fps) and a low frequency LSTM with a 40 second window at 3 fps were used for\nspatial, temporal, and multi-camera integration.\nResults: The accuracy and F1 of the six systems were: Top-view (0.88/0.88),\nClose-up (0.81,0.83), both cameras (0.9/0.9), high fps LSTM (0.92/0.93), low\nfps LSTM (0.9/0.91), and our final architecture the Multi-camera\nclassifier(0.93/0.94).\nConclusion: By combining a system with a high fps and a low fps from the\nmultiple camera array we improved the classification abilities of the global\nground truth.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been playing a pivotal role in\nAI-related applications. Despite the large sizes, existing KGs are far from\ncomplete and comprehensive. In order to continuously enrich KGs, automatic\nknowledge construction and update mechanisms are usually utilized, which\ninevitably bring in plenty of noise. However, most existing knowledge graph\nembedding (KGE) methods assume that all the triple facts in KGs are correct,\nand project both entities and relations into a low-dimensional space without\nconsidering noise and knowledge conflicts. This will lead to low-quality and\nunreliable representations of KGs. To this end, in this paper, we propose a\ngeneral multi-task reinforcement learning framework, which can greatly\nalleviate the noisy data problem. In our framework, we exploit reinforcement\nlearning for choosing high-quality knowledge triples while filtering out the\nnoisy ones. Also, in order to take full advantage of the correlations among\nsemantically similar relations, the triple selection processes of similar\nrelations are trained in a collective way with multi-task learning. Moreover,\nwe extend popular KGE models TransE, DistMult, ConvE and RotatE with the\nproposed framework. Finally, the experimental validation shows that our\napproach is able to enhance existing KGE models and can provide more robust\nrepresentations of KGs in noisy scenarios.",

Commonly, the system parameters of the mathematical model are\nobtained by the captive model test (CMT), which is time-consuming to construct\nan accurate model suitable for complex berthing maneuvers.

    "title": "Reducing Data Complexity using Autoencoders with Class-informed Loss  Functions",
    "abstract": "Available data in machine learning applications is becoming increasingly\ncomplex, due to higher dimensionality and difficult classes. There exists a\nwide variety of approaches to measuring complexity of labeled data, according\nto class overlap, separability or boundary shapes, as well as group morphology.\nMany techniques can transform the data in order to find better features, but\nfew focus on specifically reducing data complexity. Most data transformation\nmethods mainly treat the dimensionality aspect, leaving aside the available\ninformation within class labels which can be useful when classes are somehow\ncomplex.\nThis paper proposes an autoencoder-based approach to complexity reduction,\nusing class labels in order to inform the loss function about the adequacy of\nthe generated variables. This leads to three different new feature learners,\nScorer, Skaler and Slicer. They are based on Fisher's discriminant ratio, the\nKullback-Leibler divergence and least-squares support vector machines,\nrespectively. They can be applied as a preprocessing stage for a binary\nclassification problem. A thorough experimentation across a collection of 27\ndatasets and a range of complexity and classification metrics shows that\nclass-informed autoencoders perform better than 4 other popular unsupervised\nfeature extraction techniques, especially when the final objective is using the\ndata for a classification task.",

The\nsecurity and privacy of the sensitive health-related data transmitted through\nthe WBAN should be preserved to maximize its benefits. In this regard, user\nauthentication is one of the primary mechanisms to protect health data that\nverifies the identities of entities involved in the communication process.\nSince WBAN carries crucial health data, every entity engaged in the data\ntransfer process must be authenticated.

    "abstract": "In this work, we focus on Interactive Human Parsing (IHP), which aims to\nsegment a human image into multiple human body parts with guidance from users'\ninteractions. This new task inherits the class-aware property of human parsing,\nwhich cannot be well solved by traditional interactive image segmentation\napproaches that are generally class-agnostic. To tackle this new task, we first\nexploit user clicks to identify different human parts in the given image. These\nclicks are subsequently transformed into semantic-aware localization maps,\nwhich are concatenated with the RGB image to form the input of the segmentation\nnetwork and generate the initial parsing result. To enable the network to\nbetter perceive user's purpose during the correction process, we investigate\nseveral principal ways for the refinement, and reveal that\nrandom-sampling-based click augmentation is the best way for promoting the\ncorrection effectiveness. Furthermore, we also propose a semantic-perceiving\nloss (SP-loss) to augment the training, which can effectively exploit the\nsemantic relationships of clicks for better optimization. To the best\nknowledge, this work is the first attempt to tackle the human parsing task\nunder the interactive setting. Our IHP solution achieves 85\\% mIoU on the\nbenchmark LIP, 80\\% mIoU on PASCAL-Person-Part and CIHP, 75\\% mIoU on Helen\nwith only 1.95, 3.02, 2.84 and 1.09 clicks per class respectively. These\nresults demonstrate that we can simply acquire high-quality human parsing masks\nwith only a few human effort.

    "abstract": "In the non-uniform sparsest cut problem, we are given a supply graph G and a\ndemand graph D, both with the same set of nodes V. The goal is to find a cut of\nV that minimizes the ratio of the total capacity on the edges of G crossing the\ncut over the total demand of the crossing edges of D. In this work, we study\nthe non-uniform sparsest cut problem for supply graphs with bounded treewidth\nk. For this case, Gupta, Talwar and Witmer [STOC 2013] obtained a\n2-approximation with polynomial running time for fixed k, and the question of\nwhether there exists a c-approximation algorithm for a constant c independent\nof k, that runs in FPT time, remained open. We answer this question in the\naffirmative. We design a 2-approximation algorithm for the non-uniform sparsest\ncut with bounded treewidth supply graphs that runs in FPT time, when\nparameterized by the treewidth. Our algorithm is based on rounding the optimal\nsolution of a linear programming relaxation inspired by the Sherali-Adams\nhierarchy. In contrast to the classic Sherali-Adams approach, we construct a\nrelaxation driven by a tree decomposition of the supply graph by including a\ncarefully chosen set of lifting variables and constraints to encode information\nof subsets of nodes with super-constant size, and at the same time we have a\nsufficiently small linear program that can be solved in FPT time.",

An uncertainty\nquantification of a model for In-Stent Restenosis with four uncertain\nparameters (endothelium regeneration time, the threshold strain for smooth\nmuscle cells bond breaking, blood flow velocity and the percentage of\nfenestration in the internal elastic lamina) is presented. Two quantities of\ninterest were studied, namely the average cross-sectional area and the maximum\nrelative area loss in a vessel. Due to the computational intensity of the model\nand the number of evaluations required in the uncertainty quantification, a\nsurrogate model, based on Gaussian process regression with proper orthogonal\ndecomposition, was developed which subsequently replaced the original In-Stent\nRestenosis model in the uncertainty quantification. A detailed analysis of the\nuncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis is presented. Around 11% and\n16% of uncertainty are observed on the average cross-sectional area and maximum\nrelative area loss respectively, and the uncertainty estimates show that a\nhigher fenestration mainly determines uncertainty in the neointimal growth at\nthe initial stage of the process.

    "abstract": "Optimising the quality-of-results (QoR) of circuits during logic synthesis is\na formidable challenge necessitating the exploration of exponentially sized\nsearch spaces. While expert-designed operations aid in uncovering effective\nsequences, the increase in complexity of logic circuits favours automated\nprocedures. Inspired by the successes of machine learning, researchers adapted\ndeep learning and reinforcement learning to logic synthesis applications.\nHowever successful, those techniques suffer from high sample complexities\npreventing widespread adoption. To enable efficient and scalable solutions, we\npropose BOiLS, the first algorithm adapting modern Bayesian optimisation to\nnavigate the space of synthesis operations. BOiLS requires no human\nintervention and effectively trades-off exploration versus exploitation through\nnovel Gaussian process kernels and trust-region constrained acquisitions. In a\nset of experiments on EPFL benchmarks, we demonstrate BOiLS's superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art in terms of both sample efficiency and\nQoR values.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we apply our understanding of the radical enactivist agenda to\na classic AI-hard problem. Natural Language Understanding is a sub-field of AI\nresearch that looked easy to the pioneers. Thus the Turing Test, in its\noriginal form, assumed that the computer could use language and the challenge\nwas to fake human intelligence. It turned out that playing chess and formal\nlogic were easy compared to the necessary language skills. The techniques of\ngood old-fashioned AI (GOFAI) assume symbolic representation is the core of\nreasoning and human communication consisted of transferring representations\nfrom one mind to another. But by this model one finds that representations\nappear in another's mind, without appearing in the intermediary language.\nPeople communicate by mind reading it seems. Systems with speech interfaces\nsuch as Alexa and Siri are of course common but they are limited. Rather than\nadding mind reading skills, we introduced a \"cheat\" that enabled our systems to\nfake it. The cheat is simple and only slightly interesting to computer\nscientists and not at all interesting to philosophers. However, reading about\nthe enactivist idea that we \"directly perceive\" the intentions of others, our\ncheat took on a new light and in this paper look again at how natural language\nunderstanding might actually work between humans.",

While\nexisting works achieve promising performance under controlled settings,\npractical applications are still limited due to the need of intensive data\ncollection, extra training efforts when adapting to new domains (i.e.\nenvironments, persons and locations) and poor performance for real-time\nrecognition. In this paper, we propose DI-Gesture, a domain-independent and\nreal-time mmWave gesture recognition system. Specifically, we first derive the\nsignal variation corresponding to human gestures with spatial-temporal\nprocessing. To enhance the robustness of the system and reduce data collecting\nefforts, we design a data augmentation framework based on the correlation\nbetween signal patterns and gesture variations. Furthermore, we propose a\ndynamic window mechanism to perform gesture segmentation automatically and\naccurately, thus enable real-time recognition. Finally, we build a lightweight\nneural network to extract spatial-temporal information from the data for\ngesture classification. Extensive experimental results show DI-Gesture achieves\nan average accuracy of 97.92%, 99.18% and 98.76% for new users, environments\nand locations, respectively. In real-time scenario, the accuracy of DI-Gesutre\nreaches over 97% with average inference time of 2.87ms, which demonstrates the\nsuperior robustness and effectiveness of our system.",

This paper adopts a\nhybrid-system view of nonlinear modeling and control that lends an explicit\nhierarchical structure to the problem and breaks down complex dynamics into\nsimpler localized units. Therefore, we consider a sequence modeling paradigm\nthat captures the temporal structure of the data and derive an\nexpecation-maximization (EM) algorithm that automatically decomposes nonlinear\ndynamics into stochastic piecewise affine dynamical systems with nonlinear\nboundaries. Furthermore, we show that these time-series models naturally admit\na closed-loop extension that we use to extract locally linear or polynomial\nfeedback controllers from nonlinear experts via imitation learning. Finally, we\nintroduce a novel hybrid realtive entropy policy search (Hb-REPS) technique\nthat incorporates the hierarchical nature of hybrid systems and optimizes a set\nof time-invariant local feedback controllers derived from a locally polynomial\napproximation of a global value function.",

An\nexhaustive method for Boolean matching is computationally expensive even for\nfunctions with only a few variables, because the time complexity of such an\nalgorithm for an n-variable Boolean function is $O(2^{n+1}n!)$. Sensitivity is\nan important characteristic and a measure of the complexity of Boolean\nfunctions. It has been used in analysis of the complexity of algorithms in\ndifferent fields. This measure could be regarded as a signature of Boolean\nfunctions and has great potential to help reduce the search space of Boolean\nmatching.\nIn this paper, we introduce Boolean sensitivity into Boolean matching and\ndesign several sensitivity-related signatures to enhance fast Boolean matching.\nFirst, we propose some new signatures that relate sensitivity to Boolean\nequivalence. Then, we prove that these signatures are prerequisites for Boolean\nmatching, which we can use to reduce the search space of the matching problem.\nBesides, we develop a fast sensitivity calculation method to compute and\ncompare these signatures of two Boolean functions. Compared with the\ntraditional cofactor and symmetric detection methods, sensitivity is a series\nof signatures of another dimension. We also show that sensitivity can be easily\nintegrated into traditional methods and distinguish the mismatched Boolean\nfunctions faster. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that\nintroduces sensitivity to Boolean matching.

In demonstrating the conditions under which\nthe inference accuracy is extremely low, our paper highlights the need to\ncarefully evaluate the applicability of the method before running the inference\non real data.

    "abstract": "Bridge health monitoring using machine learning tools has become an efficient\nand cost-effective approach in recent times. In the present study, strains in\nrailway bridge member, available from a previous study conducted by IIT\nGuwahati has been utilized. These strain data were collected from an existing\nbridge while trains were passing over the bridge. LSTM is used to train the\nnetwork and to predict strains in different members of the railway bridge.\nActual field data has been used for the purpose of predicting strain in\ndifferent members using strain data from a single member, yet it has been\nobserved that they are quite agreeable to those of ground truth values. This is\nin spite of the fact that a lot of noise existed in the data, thus showing the\nefficacy of LSTM in training and predicting even from noisy field data. This\nmay easily open up the possibility of collecting data from the bridge with a\nmuch lesser number of sensors and predicting the strain data in other members\nthrough LSTM network.",

DCC tackles an important technical problem to\ncompress streamed video from the drone to the edge without scarifying accuracy\nand timeliness of video analytical tasks performed at the edge. DCC is inspired\nby the fact that not every bit in streamed video is equally valuable to video\nanalytics, which opens new compression room over the conventional\nanalytics-oblivious video codec technology. We exploit drone-specific context\nand intermediate hints from object detection to pursue adaptive fidelity needed\nto retain analytical quality. We have prototyped DCC in one showcase\napplication of vehicle detection and validated its efficiency in representative\nscenarios.

In other words, the AI player\nbecomes too strong as an opponent of human players. Then, we will not enjoy\nplaying board games with the AI player. In order to entertain human players,\nthe AI player is required to balance its skill with the human player's one\nautomatically. To address this issue, I propose AlphaDDA, an AI player with\ndynamic difficulty adjustment based on AlphaZero. AlphaDDA consists of a deep\nneural network (DNN) and Monte Carlo tree search like AlphaZero. AlphaDDA\nestimates the value of the game state form only the board state using the DNN\nand changes its skill according to the value. AlphaDDA can adjust AlphaDDA's\nskill using only the state of a game without prior knowledge about an opponent.\nIn this study, AlphaDDA plays Connect4, 6x6 Othello, which is Othello using a\n6x6 size board, and Othello with the other AI agents. The other AI agents are\nAlphaZero, Monte Carlo tree search, Minimax algorithm, and a random player.\nThis study shows that AlphaDDA achieves to balance its skill with the other AI\nagents except for a random player.

We enhance\nour understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized\ncomplexity. Our focus lies on parameters that measure the structural properties\nof the input instance. We show that the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by a\nwide range of fairly restrictive structural parameters such as the feedback\nvertex set number, pathwidth, treedepth, and even the size of a minimum vertex\ndeletion set into graphs of pathwidth and treedepth at most three. We also show\nthat the Harmless Set problem with majority thresholds is W[1]-hard when\nparameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. We prove that the Harmless\nSet problem can be solved in polynomial time on graph with bounded cliquewidth.\nOn the positive side, we obtain fixed-parameter algorithms for the problem with\nrespect to neighbourhood diversity and twin cover. We show that the problem\nparameterized by the solution size is fixed parameter tractable on planar\ngraphs. We thereby resolve two open questions stated in C. Bazgan and M.

    "abstract": "We consider finite $n$-person deterministic graphical (DG) games. These games\nare modelled by finite directed graphs (digraphs) $G$ which may have directed\ncycles and, hence, infinite plays. Yet, it is assumed that all these plays are\nequivalent and form a single outcome $c$, while the terminal vertices $V_T =\n\\{a_1, \\ldots, a_p\\}$ form $p$ remaining outcomes. We study the existence of\nNash equilibria (NE) in pure stationary strategies. It is known that NE exist\nwhen $n=2$ and may fail to exist when $n > 2$. Yet, the question becomes open\nfor $n > 2$ under the following extra condition: (C) For each of $n$ players,\n$c$ is worse than each of $p$ terminal outcomes. In other words, all players\nare interested in terminating the play, which is a natural assumption.\nMoreover, Nash-solvability remains open even if we replace (C) by a weaker\ncondition: (C22) There exist no two players for whom $c$ is better than (at\nleast) two terminal outcomes. We conjecture that such two players exist in each\nNE-free DG game, or in other words, that (C22) implies Nash-solvability, for\nall $n$. Recently, the DG games were extended to a wider class of the DG\nmulti-stage (DGMS) games, whose outcomes are the strongly connected components\n(SCC) of digraph $G$. Merging all outcomes of a DGMS game that correspond to\nits non-terminal SCCs we obtain a DG game. Clearly, this operation respects\nNash-solvability (NS). Basic conditions and conjectures related to NS can be\nextended from the DG to DGMS games: in both cases NE exist if $n=2$ and may\nfail to exist when $n > 2$; furthermore, we modify conditions (C) and (C22) to\nadapt them for the DGMS games.

This problem has been extensively studied in the static/offline\nsetting. In this paper we initiate its study in the fully-dynamic setting with\nrecourse: the algorithm sees a stream of T insertions and deletions of vectors,\nand at each time must maintain a low-discrepancy signing, while also minimizing\nthe amortized recourse (the number of times any vector changes its sign) per\nupdate.\nFor general vectors, we show algorithms which almost match Spencer's\n$O(\\sqrt{n})$ offline discrepancy bound, with ${O}(n\\cdot poly\\!\\log T)$\namortized recourse per update. The crucial idea is to compute a basic feasible\nsolution to the linear relaxation in a distributed and recursive manner, which\nhelps find a low-discrepancy signing. To bound recourse we argue that only a\nsmall part of the instance needs to be re-computed at each update.\nSince vector balancing has also been greatly studied for sparse vectors, we\nthen give algorithms for low-discrepancy edge orientation, where we dynamically\nmaintain signings for 2-sparse vectors. Alternatively, this can be seen as\norienting a dynamic set of edges of an n-vertex graph to minimize the absolute\ndifference between in- and out-degrees at any vertex. We present a\ndeterministic algorithm with $O(poly\\!\\log n)$ discrepancy and $O(poly\\!\\log\nn)$ amortized recourse. The core ideas are to dynamically maintain an\nexpander-decomposition with low recourse and then to show that, as the\nexpanders change over time, a natural local-search algorithm converges quickly\n(i.e., with low recourse) to a low-discrepancy solution. We also give strong\nlower bounds for local-search discrepancy minimization algorithms.",

    "abstract": "To mitigate the problem of having to traverse over the full vocabulary in the\nsoftmax normalization of a neural language model, sampling-based training\ncriteria are proposed and investigated in the context of large vocabulary\nword-based neural language models. These training criteria typically enjoy the\nbenefit of faster training and testing, at a cost of slightly degraded\nperformance in terms of perplexity and almost no visible drop in word error\nrate. While noise contrastive estimation is one of the most popular choices,\nrecently we show that other sampling-based criteria can also perform well, as\nlong as an extra correction step is done, where the intended class posterior\nprobability is recovered from the raw model outputs. In this work, we propose\nself-normalized importance sampling. Compared to our previous work, the\ncriteria considered in this work are self-normalized and there is no need to\nfurther conduct a correction step. Compared to noise contrastive estimation,\nour method is directly comparable in terms of complexity in application.\nThrough self-normalized language model training as well as lattice rescoring\nexperiments, we show that our proposed self-normalized importance sampling is\ncompetitive in both research-oriented and production-oriented automatic speech\nrecognition tasks.",

    "title": "Implicit SVD for Graph Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "Recent improvements in the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for\nGraph Representational Learning (GRL) have come at the cost of significant\ncomputational resource requirements for training, e.g., for calculating\ngradients via backprop over many data epochs. Meanwhile, Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD) can find closed-form solutions to convex problems, using\nmerely a handful of epochs. In this paper, we make GRL more computationally\ntractable for those with modest hardware. We design a framework that computes\nSVD of \\textit{implicitly} defined matrices, and apply this framework to\nseveral GRL tasks. For each task, we derive linear approximation of a SOTA\nmodel, where we design (expensive-to-store) matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ and train the\nmodel, in closed-form, via SVD of $\\mathbf{M}$, without calculating entries of\n$\\mathbf{M}$. By converging to a unique point in one step, and without\ncalculating gradients, our models show competitive empirical test performance\nover various graphs such as article citation and biological interaction\nnetworks. More importantly, SVD can initialize a deeper model, that is\narchitected to be non-linear almost everywhere, though behaves linearly when\nits parameters reside on a hyperplane, onto which SVD initializes. The deeper\nmodel can then be fine-tuned within only a few epochs. Overall, our procedure\ntrains hundreds of times faster than state-of-the-art methods, while competing\non empirical test performance.

Although rich literature exists on\nunsupervised domain adaptation for classification, the methods proposed,\nespecially in regressions, remain scarce and often depend on additional\ninformation regarding the input data.

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving has attracted significant research interests in the past\ntwo decades as it offers many potential benefits, including releasing drivers\nfrom exhausting driving and mitigating traffic congestion, among others.\nDespite promising progress, lane-changing remains a great challenge for\nautonomous vehicles (AV), especially in mixed and dynamic traffic scenarios.\nRecently, reinforcement learning (RL), a powerful data-driven control method,\nhas been widely explored for lane-changing decision makings in AVs with\nencouraging results demonstrated. However, the majority of those studies are\nfocused on a single-vehicle setting, and lane-changing in the context of\nmultiple AVs coexisting with human-driven vehicles (HDVs) have received scarce\nattention. In this paper, we formulate the lane-changing decision making of\nmultiple AVs in a mixed-traffic highway environment as a multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) problem, where each AV makes lane-changing\ndecisions based on the motions of both neighboring AVs and HDVs. Specifically,\na multi-agent advantage actor-critic network (MA2C) is developed with a novel\nlocal reward design and a parameter sharing scheme. In particular, a\nmulti-objective reward function is proposed to incorporate fuel efficiency,\ndriving comfort, and safety of autonomous driving. Comprehensive experimental\nresults, conducted under three different traffic densities and various levels\nof human driver aggressiveness, show that our proposed MARL framework\nconsistently outperforms several state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of\nefficiency, safety and driver comfort.",

    "abstract": "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) remain one of the major\noccupational safety and health problems in the European Union nowadays. Thus,\ncontinuous tracking of workers' exposure to the factors that may contribute to\ntheir development is paramount. This paper introduces an online approach to\nmonitor kinematic and dynamic quantities on the workers, providing on the spot\nan estimate of the physical load required in their daily jobs. A set of\nergonomic indexes is defined to account for multiple potential contributors to\nWMSDs, also giving importance to the subject-specific requirements of the\nworkers. To evaluate the proposed framework, a thorough experimental analysis\nwas conducted on twelve human subjects considering tasks that represent typical\nworking activities in the manufacturing sector. For each task, the ergonomic\nindexes that better explain the underlying physical load were identified,\nfollowing a statistical analysis, and supported by the outcome of a surface\nelectromyography (sEMG) analysis. A comparison was also made with a\nwell-recognised and standard tool to evaluate human ergonomics in the\nworkplace, to highlight the benefits introduced by the proposed framework.\nResults demonstrate the high potential of the proposed framework in identifying\nthe physical risk factors, and therefore to adopt preventive measures. Another\nequally important contribution of this study is the creation of a comprehensive\ndatabase on human kinodynamic measurements, which hosts multiple sensory data\nof healthy subjects performing typical industrial tasks.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic approximation (SA) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD)\nalgorithms are work-horses for modern machine learning algorithms. Their\nconstant stepsize variants are preferred in practice due to fast convergence\nbehavior. However, constant step stochastic iterative algorithms do not\nconverge asymptotically to the optimal solution, but instead have a stationary\ndistribution, which in general cannot be analytically characterized. In this\nwork, we study the asymptotic behavior of the appropriately scaled stationary\ndistribution, in the limit when the constant stepsize goes to zero.\nSpecifically, we consider the following three settings: (1) SGD algorithms with\nsmooth and strongly convex objective, (2) linear SA algorithms involving a\nHurwitz matrix, and (3) nonlinear SA algorithms involving a contractive\noperator. When the iterate is scaled by $1/\\sqrt{\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ is\nthe constant stepsize, we show that the limiting scaled stationary distribution\nis a solution of an integral equation. Under a uniqueness assumption (which can\nbe removed in certain settings) on this equation, we further characterize the\nlimiting distribution as a Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix is the\nunique solution of a suitable Lyapunov equation. For SA algorithms beyond these\ncases, our numerical experiments suggest that unlike central limit theorem type\nresults: (1) the scaling factor need not be $1/\\sqrt{\\alpha}$, and (2) the\nlimiting distribution need not be Gaussian. Based on the numerical study, we\ncome up with a formula to determine the right scaling factor, and make\ninsightful connection to the Euler-Maruyama discretization scheme for\napproximating stochastic differential equations.",

    "title": "Robust Moving Target Defence Against False Data Injection Attacks in  Power Grids",
    "abstract": "Recently, moving target defence (MTD) has been proposed to thwart the false\ndata injection (FDI) attacks in power system state estimation by proactively\ntriggering the distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS) devices.\nOne of the key challenges for MTD in power grid is to design its real-time\nimplementation with performance guarantees against unknown attacks. To tackle\nthis, a novel robust MTD strategy is proposed to guarantee the worst-case\ndetection rate against all unknown attacks in noisy environment. We first\ntheoretically prove that, for any given MTD strategy, the minimal principal\nangle between subspaces corresponds to the worst-case performance against all\npotential attacks. Based on this, robust MTD algorithms are then formulated for\nthe systems with both complete and incomplete configurations. In addition, this\npaper proposes the concept of robust hidden MTD under noisy environment, which\nis shown to alleviate the contradiction between the effectiveness and the\nhiddenness of MTD. Extensive simulations using standard IEEE benchmarks\ndemonstrate the improved average and worst-case performances of MTD by using\nthe proposed algorithms.",

    "title": "Unsupervised Part Discovery from Contrastive Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "The goal of self-supervised visual representation learning is to learn\nstrong, transferable image representations, with the majority of research\nfocusing on object or scene level. On the other hand, representation learning\nat part level has received significantly less attention. In this paper, we\npropose an unsupervised approach to object part discovery and segmentation and\nmake three contributions. First, we construct a proxy task through a set of\nobjectives that encourages the model to learn a meaningful decomposition of the\nimage into its parts. Secondly, prior work argues for reconstructing or\nclustering pre-computed features as a proxy to parts; we show empirically that\nthis alone is unlikely to find meaningful parts; mainly because of their low\nresolution and the tendency of classification networks to spatially smear out\ninformation. We suggest that image reconstruction at the level of pixels can\nalleviate this problem, acting as a complementary cue. Lastly, we show that the\nstandard evaluation based on keypoint regression does not correlate well with\nsegmentation quality and thus introduce different metrics, NMI and ARI, that\nbetter characterize the decomposition of objects into parts. Our method yields\nsemantic parts which are consistent across fine-grained but visually distinct\ncategories, outperforming the state of the art on three benchmark datasets.\nCode is available at the project page:\nhttps://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/unsup-parts/.",

[ACM Trans.\\ Alg.\\\n16(4):46:1-46:19], who showed that a constant approximation for $t$-NU$k$C is\nnot possible if $t$ is unbounded. On the other hand, they gave a bicriteria\napproximation that violates the number of allowed balls as well as the given\nradii by a constant factor. They also conjectured that a constant approximation\nfor $t$-NU$k$C should be possible if $t$ is a fixed constant. Since then, there\nhas been steady progress towards resolving this conjecture -- currently, a\nconstant approximation for $3$-NU$k$C is known via the results of Chakrabarty\nand Negahbani [IPCO 2021], and Jia et al. [To appear in SOSA 2022]. We push the\nhorizon by giving an $O(1)$-approximation for the Non-Uniform $k$-Center for\n$4$ distinct types of radii. Our result is obtained via a novel combination of\ntools and techniques from the $k$-center literature, which also demonstrates\nthat the different generalizations of $k$-center involving non-uniform radii,\nand multiple coverage constraints (i.e., colorful $k$-center), are closely\ninterlinked with each other. We hope that our ideas will contribute towards a\ndeeper understanding of the $t$-NU$k$C problem, eventually bringing us closer\nto the resolution of the CGK conjecture.",

    "abstract": "Data is the most powerful decision-making tool at our disposal. However,\ndespite the exponentially growing volumes of data generated in the world,\nputting it to effective use still presents many challenges. Relevant data seems\nto be never there when it is needed - it remains siloed, hard to find, hard to\naccess, outdated, and of bad quality. As a result, governments, institutions,\nand businesses remain largely impaired in their ability to make data-driven\ndecisions. At the same time, data science is undergoing a reproducibility\ncrisis. The results of the vast majority of studies cannot be replicated by\nother researchers, and provenance often cannot be established, even for data\nused in medical studies that affect lives of millions. We are losing our\nability to collaborate at a time when significant improvements to data are\nbadly needed. We believe that the fundamental reason lies in the modern data\nmanagement processes being entirely at odds with the basic principles of\ncollaboration and trust. Our field needs a fundamental shift of approach in how\ndata is viewed, how it is shared and transformed. We must transition away from\ntreating data as static, from exchanging it as anemic binary blobs, and instead\nfocus on making multi-party data management more sustainable: such as\nreproducibility, verifiability, provenance, autonomy, and low latency. In this\npaper, we present the Open Data Fabric, a new decentralized data exchange and\ntransformation protocol designed from the ground up to simplify data management\nand enable collaboration around data on a similar scale as currently seen in\nopen-source software.",

    "abstract": "This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised\nlearners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random\npatches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on\ntwo core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture,\nwith an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without\nmask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original\nimage from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that\nmasking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial\nand meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to\ntrain large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3x\nor more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning\nhigh-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model\nachieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K\ndata. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised\npre-training and shows promising scaling behavior.",

    "abstract": "Learning complex manipulation tasks in realistic, obstructed environments is\na challenging problem due to hard exploration in the presence of obstacles and\nhigh-dimensional visual observations. Prior work tackles the exploration\nproblem by integrating motion planning and reinforcement learning. However, the\nmotion planner augmented policy requires access to state information, which is\noften not available in the real-world settings. To this end, we propose to\ndistill a state-based motion planner augmented policy to a visual control\npolicy via (1) visual behavioral cloning to remove the motion planner\ndependency along with its jittery motion, and (2) vision-based reinforcement\nlearning with the guidance of the smoothed trajectories from the behavioral\ncloning agent. We evaluate our method on three manipulation tasks in obstructed\nenvironments and compare it against various reinforcement learning and\nimitation learning baselines. The results demonstrate that our framework is\nhighly sample-efficient and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms.\nMoreover, coupled with domain randomization, our policy is capable of zero-shot\ntransfer to unseen environment settings with distractors.

    "abstract": "This work establishes that the physical layer can be used to perform\ninformation-theoretic authentication in additive white Gaussian noise channels,\nas long as the adversary is not omniscient. The model considered consists of an\nencoder, decoder, and adversary, where the adversary has access to the message,\na non-causal noisy observation of the encoder's transmission, and unlimited\ntransmission power, while the decoder observes a noisy version of the sum of\nthe encoder and adversary's outputs. A method to modify a generic existing\nchannel code to enable authentication is presented. It is shown that this\nmodification costs an asymptotically negligible amount of the coding rate,\nwhile still enabling authentication as long as the adversary's observation is\nnot noiseless. Also notable is that this modification is not (asymptotically) a\nfunction of the statistical characterization of the adversary's channel and\nfurthermore no secret key is required, hence paving the way for a robust\npractical implementation. Using these results, the channel-authenticated\ncapacity is calculated and shown to be equal to the non-adversarial channel\ncapacity.

We\ncast our task as one of learning a manifold, where we aim to infer a\nlow-dimensional, locally linear subspace in which our data resides. By\nenforcing coverage of the manifold, local linearity, and local isometry, our\nmodel -- dubbed GEM -- learns to capture the underlying structure of datasets\nacross modalities. We can then travel along linear regions of our manifold to\nobtain perceptually consistent interpolations between samples, and can further\nuse GEM to recover points on our manifold and glean not only diverse\ncompletions of input images, but cross-modal hallucinations of audio or image\nsignals.

    "abstract": "Internal computational models of physical bodies are fundamental to the\nability of robots and animals alike to plan and control their actions. These\n\"self-models\" allow robots to consider outcomes of multiple possible future\nactions, without trying them out in physical reality. Recent progress in fully\ndata-driven self-modeling has enabled machines to learn their own forward\nkinematics directly from task-agnostic interaction data. However,\nforward-kinema\\-tics models can only predict limited aspects of the morphology,\nsuch as the position of end effectors or velocity of joints and masses. A key\nchallenge is to model the entire morphology and kinematics, without prior\nknowledge of what aspects of the morphology will be relevant to future tasks.\nHere, we propose that instead of directly modeling forward-kinematics, a more\nuseful form of self-modeling is one that could answer space occupancy queries,\nconditioned on the robot's state. Such query-driven self models are continuous\nin the spatial domain, memory efficient, fully differentiable and kinematic\naware. In physical experiments, we demonstrate how a visual self-model is\naccurate to about one percent of the workspace, enabling the robot to perform\nvarious motion planning and control tasks. Visual self-modeling can also allow\nthe robot to detect, localize and recover from real-world damage, leading to\nimproved machine resiliency.

    "abstract": "Humans can easily segment moving objects without knowing what they are. That\nobjectness could emerge from continuous visual observations motivates us to\nmodel grouping and movement concurrently from unlabeled videos. Our premise is\nthat a video has different views of the same scene related by moving\ncomponents, and the right region segmentation and region flow would allow\nmutual view synthesis which can be checked from the data itself without any\nexternal supervision. Our model starts with two separate pathways: an\nappearance pathway that outputs feature-based region segmentation for a single\nimage, and a motion pathway that outputs motion features for a pair of images.\nIt then binds them in a conjoint representation called segment flow that pools\nflow offsets over each region and provides a gross characterization of moving\nregions for the entire scene. By training the model to minimize view synthesis\nerrors based on segment flow, our appearance and motion pathways learn region\nsegmentation and flow estimation automatically without building them up from\nlow-level edges or optical flows respectively. Our model demonstrates the\nsurprising emergence of objectness in the appearance pathway, surpassing prior\nworks on zero-shot object segmentation from an image, moving object\nsegmentation from a video with unsupervised test-time adaptation, and semantic\nimage segmentation by supervised fine-tuning. Our work is the first truly\nend-to-end zero-shot object segmentation from videos. It not only develops\ngeneric objectness for segmentation and tracking, but also outperforms\nprevalent image-based contrastive learning methods without augmentation\nengineering.",

    "title": "Exponential separations between learning with and without quantum memory",
    "abstract": "We study the power of quantum memory for learning properties of quantum\nsystems and dynamics, which is of great importance in physics and chemistry.\nMany state-of-the-art learning algorithms require access to an additional\nexternal quantum memory. While such a quantum memory is not required a priori,\nin many cases, algorithms that do not utilize quantum memory require much more\ndata than those which do. We show that this trade-off is inherent in a wide\nrange of learning problems. Our results include the following:\n(1) We show that to perform shadow tomography on an $n$-qubit state rho with\n$M$ observables, any algorithm without quantum memory requires $\\Omega(\\min(M,\n2^n))$ samples of rho in the worst case. Up to logarithmic factors, this\nmatches the upper bound of [HKP20] and completely resolves an open question in\n[Aar18, AR19].\n(2) We establish exponential separations between algorithms with and without\nquantum memory for purity testing, distinguishing scrambling and depolarizing\nevolutions, as well as uncovering symmetry in physical dynamics. Our\nseparations improve and generalize prior work of [ACQ21] by allowing for a\nbroader class of algorithms without quantum memory.\n(3) We give the first tradeoff between quantum memory and sample complexity.\nWe prove that to estimate absolute values of all $n$-qubit Pauli observables,\nalgorithms with $k < n$ qubits of quantum memory require at least\n$\\Omega(2^{(n-k)/3})$ samples, but there is an algorithm using $n$-qubit\nquantum memory which only requires $O(n)$ samples.\nThe separations we show are sufficiently large and could already be evident,\nfor instance, with tens of qubits. This provides a concrete path towards\ndemonstrating real-world advantage for learning algorithms with quantum memory.",

We address this limitation by\nintroducing Feature Vectors, a new global interpretability method designed for\ntabular datasets. In addition to providing feature-importance, Feature Vectors\ndiscovers the inherent semantic relationship among features via an intuitive\nfeature visualization technique. Our systematic experiments demonstrate the\nempirical utility of this new method by applying it to several real-world\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "The detection of brain metastases (BM) in their early stages could have a\npositive impact on the outcome of cancer patients. We previously developed a\nframework for detecting small BM (with diameters of less than 15mm) in\nT1-weighted Contrast-Enhanced 3D Magnetic Resonance images (T1c) to assist\nmedical experts in this time-sensitive and high-stakes task. The framework\nutilizes a dedicated convolutional neural network (CNN) trained using labeled\nT1c data, where the ground truth BM segmentations were provided by a\nradiologist. This study aims to advance the framework with a noisy\nstudent-based self-training strategy to make use of a large corpus of unlabeled\nT1c data (i.e., data without BM segmentations or detections). Accordingly, the\nwork (1) describes the student and teacher CNN architectures, (2) presents data\nand model noising mechanisms, and (3) introduces a novel pseudo-labeling\nstrategy factoring in the learned BM detection sensitivity of the framework.\nFinally, it describes a semi-supervised learning strategy utilizing these\ncomponents. We performed the validation using 217 labeled and 1247 unlabeled\nT1c exams via 2-fold cross-validation. The framework utilizing only the labeled\nexams produced 9.23 false positives for 90% BM detection sensitivity; whereas,\nthe framework using the introduced learning strategy led to ~9% reduction in\nfalse detections (i.e., 8.44) for the same sensitivity level. Furthermore,\nwhile experiments utilizing 75% and 50% of the labeled datasets resulted in\nalgorithm performance degradation (12.19 and 13.89 false positives\nrespectively), the impact was less pronounced with the noisy student-based\ntraining strategy (10.79 and 12.37 false positives respectively).",

    "abstract": "Many engineering problems require the prediction of\nrealization-to-realization variability or a refined description of modeled\nquantities. In that case, it is necessary to sample elements from unknown\nhigh-dimensional spaces with possibly millions of degrees of freedom. While\nthere exist methods able to sample elements from probability density functions\n(PDF) with known shapes, several approximations need to be made when the\ndistribution is unknown. In this paper the sampling method, as well as the\ninference of the underlying distribution, are both handled with a data-driven\nmethod known as generative adversarial networks (GAN), which trains two\ncompeting neural networks to produce a network that can effectively generate\nsamples from the training set distribution. In practice, it is often necessary\nto draw samples from conditional distributions. When the conditional variables\nare continuous, only one (if any) data point corresponding to a particular\nvalue of a conditioning variable may be available, which is not sufficient to\nestimate the conditional distribution. This work handles this problem using an\na priori estimation of the conditional moments of a PDF. Two approaches,\nstochastic estimation, and an external neural network are compared here for\ncomputing these moments; however, any preferred method can be used. The\nalgorithm is demonstrated in the case of the deconvolution of a filtered\nturbulent flow field. It is shown that all the versions of the proposed\nalgorithm effectively sample the target conditional distribution with minimal\nimpact on the quality of the samples compared to state-of-the-art methods.\nAdditionally, the procedure can be used as a metric for the diversity of\nsamples generated by a conditional GAN (cGAN) conditioned with continuous\nvariables.",

    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) holds great promise in reshaping the healthcare systems\ngiven its precision, efficiency, and objectivity. However, the brittleness of\nDL models to noisy and out-of-distribution inputs is ailing their deployment in\nthe clinic. Most systems produce point estimates without further information\nabout model uncertainty or confidence. This paper introduces a new Bayesian\ndeep learning framework for uncertainty quantification in segmentation neural\nnetworks, specifically encoder-decoder architectures. The proposed framework\nuses the first-order Taylor series approximation to propagate and learn the\nfirst two moments (mean and covariance) of the distribution of the model\nparameters given the training data by maximizing the evidence lower bound. The\noutput consists of two maps: the segmented image and the uncertainty map of the\nsegmentation. The uncertainty in the segmentation decisions is captured by the\ncovariance matrix of the predictive distribution. We evaluate the proposed\nframework on medical image segmentation data from Magnetic Resonances Imaging\nand Computed Tomography scans. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework is more robust to noise and adversarial\nattacks as compared to state-of-the-art segmentation models. Moreover, the\nuncertainty map of the proposed framework associates low confidence (or\nequivalently high uncertainty) to patches in the test input images that are\ncorrupted with noise, artifacts or adversarial attacks. Thus, the model can\nself-assess its segmentation decisions when it makes an erroneous prediction or\nmisses part of the segmentation structures, e.g., tumor, by presenting higher\nvalues in the uncertainty map.",

    "abstract": "A recently proposed class of models attempts to learn latent dynamics from\nhigh-dimensional observations, like images, using priors informed by\nHamiltonian mechanics. While these models have important potential applications\nin areas like robotics or autonomous driving, there is currently no good way to\nevaluate their performance: existing methods primarily rely on image\nreconstruction quality, which does not always reflect the quality of the learnt\nlatent dynamics. In this work, we empirically highlight the problems with the\nexisting measures and develop a set of new measures, including a binary\nindicator of whether the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics have been faithfully\ncaptured, which we call Symplecticity Metric or SyMetric. Our measures take\nadvantage of the known properties of Hamiltonian dynamics and are more\ndiscriminative of the model's ability to capture the underlying dynamics than\nreconstruction error. Using SyMetric, we identify a set of architectural\nchoices that significantly improve the performance of a previously proposed\nmodel for inferring latent dynamics from pixels, the Hamiltonian Generative\nNetwork (HGN). Unlike the original HGN, the new HGN++ is able to discover an\ninterpretable phase space with physically meaningful latents on some datasets.\nFurthermore, it is stable for significantly longer rollouts on a diverse range\nof 13 datasets, producing rollouts of essentially infinite length both forward\nand backwards in time with no degradation in quality on a subset of the\ndatasets.",

Therefore,\nin this work, we propose to establish the equivalence between NN and SVM, and\nspecifically, the infinitely wide NN trained by soft margin loss and the\nstandard soft margin SVM with NTK trained by subgradient descent. Our main\ntheoretical results include establishing the equivalence between NN and a broad\nfamily of $\\ell_2$ regularized KMs with finite-width bounds, which cannot be\nhandled by prior work, and showing that every finite-width NN trained by such\nregularized loss functions is approximately a KM. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nour theory can enable three practical applications, including (i)\n\\textit{non-vacuous} generalization bound of NN via the corresponding KM; (ii)\n\\textit{non-trivial} robustness certificate for the infinite-width NN (while\nexisting robustness verification methods would provide vacuous bounds); (iii)\nintrinsically more robust infinite-width NNs than those from previous kernel\nregression.

    "abstract": "In many computed tomography (CT) imaging applications, it is important to\nrapidly collect data from an object that is moving or changing with time.\nTomographic acquisition is generally assumed to be step-and-shoot, where the\nobject is rotated to each desired angle, and a view is taken. However,\nstep-and-shoot acquisition is slow and can waste photons, so in practice\nfly-scanning is done where the object is continuously rotated while collecting\ndata. However, this can result in motion-blurred views and consequently\nreconstructions with severe motion artifacts.\nIn this paper, we introduce CodEx, a modular framework for joint de-blurring\nand tomographic reconstruction that can effectively invert the motion blur\nintroduced in fly-scanning. The method is a synergistic combination of a novel\nacquisition method with a novel non-convex Bayesian reconstruction algorithm.\nCodEx works by encoding the acquisition with a known binary code that the\nreconstruction algorithm then inverts. Using a well chosen binary code to\nencode the measurements can improve the accuracy of the inversion process. The\nCodEx reconstruction method uses the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM) to split the inverse problem into iterative deblurring and\nreconstruction sub-problems, making reconstruction practical to implement. We\npresent reconstruction results on both simulated and experimental data to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Irregular repetition slotted aloha (IRSA) is a grant-free random access\nprotocol for massive machine-type communications, where a large number of users\nsporadically send their data packets to a base station (BS). IRSA is a\ncompletely distributed multiple access protocol: in any given frame, a small\nsubset of the users, i.e., the active users, transmit replicas of their packet\nin randomly selected resource elements (REs). The first step in the decoding\nprocess at the BS is to detect which users are active in each frame. To this\nend, a novel Bayesian user activity detection (UAD) algorithm is developed,\nwhich exploits both the sparsity in user activity as well as the underlying\nstructure of IRSA-based transmissions. Next, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) on the\nmean squared error in channel estimation is derived. It is empirically shown\nthat the channel estimates obtained as a by-product of the proposed UAD\nalgorithm achieves the CRB. Then, the signal to interference plus noise ratio\nachieved by the users is analyzed, accounting for UAD, channel estimation\nerrors, and pilot contamination. The impact of these non-idealities on the\nthroughput of IRSA is illustrated via Monte Carlo simulations. For example, in\na system with 1500 users and 10% of the users being active per frame, a pilot\nlength of as low as 20 symbols is sufficient for accurate user activity\ndetection. In contrast, using classical compressed sensing approaches for UAD\nwould require a pilot length of about 346 symbols. The results also reveal\ncrucial insights into dependence of UAD errors and throughput on parameters\nsuch as the length of the pilot sequence, the number of antennas at the BS, the\nnumber of users, and the signal to noise ratio.",

Their\nstochastic accelerated variants though have received limited attention: how\nmomentum interacts with the stability of (stochastic) proximal point methods\nremains largely unstudied.

Despite the prominence of this issue, current\ntreatments either remain largely limited to heuristic techniques or rely\nsignificantly on periodogram or Gaussianty assumptions. In this paper, we\npresent the ApeRIodic SEmi-parametric (ARISE) process for investigating\nefficient markets.

In practice, we apply the ARISE\nprocess to identify the efficiency of real-world markets.

    "abstract": "Income inequality is an important issue that has to be solved in order to\nmake progress in our society. The study of income inequality is well received\nthrough the Gini coefficient, which is used to measure degrees of inequality in\ngeneral. While this method is effective in several aspects, the Gini\ncoefficient alone inevitably overlooks minority subpopulations (e.g.\noccupations) which results in missing undetected patterns of inequality in\nminority.\nIn this study, the surveys of incomes and occupations from more than 12\nmillions households across Thailand have been analyzed by using both Gini\ncoefficient and network densities of income domination networks to get insight\nregarding the degrees of general and occupational income inequality issues. The\nresults show that, in agricultural provinces, there are less issues in both\ntypes of inequality (low Gini coefficients and network densities), while some\nnon-agricultural provinces face an issue of occupational income inequality\n(high network densities) without any symptom of general income inequality (low\nGini coefficients). Moreover, the results also illustrate the gaps of income\ninequality using estimation statistics, which not only support whether income\ninequality exists, but that we are also able to tell the magnitudes of income\ngaps among occupations. These results cannot be obtained via Gini coefficients\nalone. This work serves as a use case of analyzing income inequality from both\ngeneral population and subpopulations perspectives that can be utilized in\nstudies of other countries.",

    "title": "Quantum Model-Discovery",
    "abstract": "Quantum computing promises to speed up some of the most challenging problems\nin science and engineering. Quantum algorithms have been proposed showing\ntheoretical advantages in applications ranging from chemistry to logistics\noptimization. Many problems appearing in science and engineering can be\nrewritten as a set of differential equations. Quantum algorithms for solving\ndifferential equations have shown a provable advantage in the fault-tolerant\nquantum computing regime, where deep and wide quantum circuits can be used to\nsolve large linear systems like partial differential equations (PDEs)\nefficiently. Recently, variational approaches to solving non-linear PDEs also\nwith near-term quantum devices were proposed. One of the most promising general\napproaches is based on recent developments in the field of scientific machine\nlearning for solving PDEs. We extend the applicability of near-term quantum\ncomputers to more general scientific machine learning tasks, including the\ndiscovery of differential equations from a dataset of measurements. We use\ndifferentiable quantum circuits (DQCs) to solve equations parameterized by a\nlibrary of operators, and perform regression on a combination of data and\nequations. Our results show a promising path to Quantum Model Discovery (QMoD),\non the interface between classical and quantum machine learning approaches. We\ndemonstrate successful parameter inference and equation discovery using QMoD on\ndifferent systems including a second-order, ordinary differential equation and\na non-linear, partial differential equation.",

We introduce $ZERO$ $Regrets$, a general cutting plane\nalgorithm to compute, enumerate, and select Pure Nash Equilibria ($PNEs$) in\nInteger Programming Games, a class of simultaneous and non-cooperative games.\nWe present a theoretical foundation for our algorithmic reasoning and provide a\npolyhedral characterization of the convex hull of the Pure Nash Equilibria. We\nintroduce the concept of $equilibrium$ $inequality$, and devise an\n$equilibrium$ $separation$ $oracle$ to separate non-equilibrium strategies from\n$PNEs$. We test $ZERO$ $Regrets$ on two paradigmatic classes of games: the\nKnapsack Game and the Network Formation Game, a well-studied game in $AGT$. Our\nalgorithm successfully solves relevant instances of both games and shows\npromising applications for equilibria selection.",

    "abstract": "A commonly used technique for quality control in crowdsourcing is to task the\nworkers with examining an item and voting on whether the item is labeled\ncorrectly. To counteract possible noise in worker responses, one solution is to\nkeep soliciting votes from more workers until the difference between the\nnumbers of votes for the two possible outcomes exceeds a pre-specified\nthreshold {\\delta}. We show a way to model such {\\delta}-margin voting\nconsensus aggregation process using absorbing Markov chains. We provide\nclosed-form equations for the key properties of this voting process -- namely,\nfor the quality of the results, the expected number of votes to completion, the\nvariance of the required number of votes, and other moments of the\ndistribution. Using these results, we show further that one can adapt the value\nof the threshold {\\delta} to achieve quality-equivalence across voting\nprocesses that employ workers of different accuracy levels. We then use this\nresult to provide efficiency-equalizing payment rates for groups of workers\ncharacterized by different levels of response accuracy. Finally, we perform a\nset of simulated experiments using both fully synthetic data as well as\nreal-life crowdsourced votes. We show that our theoretical model characterizes\nthe outcomes of the consensus aggregation process well.",

We present a general algorithm, which describes a way\nof computing the coefficients of the polynomials and optimizing their variables\nso that the polynomial inequalities are satisfied. The algorithm uses the tools\nof validated numerics together with Chebyshev series expansion to obtain the\nperiodic orbit of the ODE as well as the solution of the variational equations,\nwhich are both used to compute rigorously the coefficients of the polynomials.\nWe apply our algorithm to prove the existence of periodic orbits in a\nstate-dependent delayed perturbation of the van der Pol equation.",

This is achieved by mapping lower\nresolution to higher resolution density fields of simulations sharing the same\ncosmology, initial conditions and box-sizes. To resolve structure down to a\nfactor of 8 increase in mass resolution, we use a variation of U-Net with a\nconditional GAN, generating output that visually and statistically matches the\nhigh resolution target extremely well.

    "title": "Kalman Filtering with Adversarial Corruptions",
    "abstract": "Here we revisit the classic problem of linear quadratic estimation, i.e.\nestimating the trajectory of a linear dynamical system from noisy measurements.\nThe celebrated Kalman filter gives an optimal estimator when the measurement\nnoise is Gaussian, but is widely known to break down when one deviates from\nthis assumption, e.g. when the noise is heavy-tailed. Many ad hoc heuristics\nhave been employed in practice for dealing with outliers. In a pioneering work,\nSchick and Mitter gave provable guarantees when the measurement noise is a\nknown infinitesimal perturbation of a Gaussian and raised the important\nquestion of whether one can get similar guarantees for large and unknown\nperturbations.\nIn this work we give a truly robust filter: we give the first strong provable\nguarantees for linear quadratic estimation when even a constant fraction of\nmeasurements have been adversarially corrupted. This framework can model\nheavy-tailed and even non-stationary noise processes. Our algorithm robustifies\nthe Kalman filter in the sense that it competes with the optimal algorithm that\nknows the locations of the corruptions. Our work is in a challenging Bayesian\nsetting where the number of measurements scales with the complexity of what we\nneed to estimate. Moreover, in linear dynamical systems past information decays\nover time. We develop a suite of new techniques to robustly extract information\nacross different time steps and over varying time scales.",
