    "abstract": "Deep learning is being used extensively in a variety of software engineering\ntasks, e.g., program classification and defect prediction. Although the\ntechnique eliminates the required process of feature engineering, the\nconstruction of source code model significantly affects the performance on\nthose tasks. Most recent works was mainly focused on complementing AST-based\nsource code models by introducing contextual dependencies extracted from CFG.\nHowever, all of them pay little attention to the representation of basic\nblocks, which are the basis of contextual dependencies.\nIn this paper, we integrated AST and CFG and proposed a novel source code\nmodel embedded with hierarchical dependencies. Based on that, we also designed\na neural network that depends on the graph attention mechanism.Specifically, we\nintroduced the syntactic structural of the basic block, i.e., its corresponding\nAST, in source code model to provide sufficient information and fill the gap.\nWe have evaluated this model on three practical software engineering tasks and\ncompared it with other state-of-the-art methods. The results show that our\nmodel can significantly improve the performance. For example, compared to the\nbest performing baseline, our model reduces the scale of parameters by 50\\% and\nachieves 4\\% improvement on accuracy on program classification task.",

    "abstract": "In standard number-in-hand multi-party communication complexity, performance\nis measured as the total number of bits transmitted globally in the network. In\nthis paper, we study a variation called local communication complexity in which\nperformance instead measures the maximum number of bits sent or received at any\none player. We focus on a simple model where $n$ players, each with one input\nbit, execute a protocol by exchanging messages to compute a function on the $n$\ninput bits. We ask what can and cannot be solved with a small local\ncommunication complexity in this setting. We begin by establishing a\nnon-trivial lower bound on the local complexity for a specific function by\nproving that counting the number of $1$'s among the first $17$ input bits\ndistributed among the participants requires a local complexity strictly greater\nthan $1$. We further investigate whether harder counting problems of this type\ncan yield stronger lower bounds, providing a largely negative answer by showing\nthat constant local complexity is sufficient to count the number $1$ bits over\nthe entire input, and therefore compute any symmetric function. In addition to\ncounting, we show that both sorting and searching can be computed in constant\nlocal complexity. We then use the counting solution as a subroutine to\ndemonstrate that constant local complexity is also sufficient to compute many\nstandard modular arithmetic operations on two operands, including: comparisons,\naddition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. Finally we\nestablish that function $GCD(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are in the range $[1,n]$\nhas local complexity of $O(1)$. Our work highlights both new techniques for\nproving lower bounds on this metric and the power of even a small amount of\nlocal communication.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, applications that are used in large and small enterprises were\ndeployed on \"bare metal\" servers installed with operating systems. Recently,\nthe use of multiple virtual machines (VMs) on the same physical server was\nadopted due to cost reduction and flexibility. Nowadays, containers have become\npopular for application deployment due to smaller footprints than the VMs,\ntheir ability to start and stop more quickly, and their capability to pack the\napplication binaries and their dependencies in standalone units for seamless\nportability. A typical container ecosystem includes a code repository (e.g.,\nGitHub) where the container images are built from the codes and libraries and\nthen pushed to the image registry (e.g., Docker Hub) for subsequent deployment\nas application containers. However, the pervasive use of containers also leads\nto a wide-range of security breaches, such as stealing credentials and\nsensitive data from image registry and code repository, carrying out DoS\nattacks, and gaining root access to the underlying host. In this paper, we\nfirst perform threat modeling on the containers ecosystem using the popular\nthreat modeling framework, called STRIDE. Using STRIDE, we identify the\nvulnerabilities in each system component, and investigate potential security\nthreats and their consequences. Then, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the\nexisting countermeasures designed against the identified threats and\nvulnerabilities. In particular, we assess the strengths and weaknesses of the\nexisting mitigation strategies designed against such threats. We believe that\nthis work will help researchers and practitioners to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the threat landscape in containers and the state-of-the-art\ncountermeasures. We also discuss open research problems and future research\ndirections in containers security, which may ignite further research to be done\nin this area.",

The\nvirus, SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the rapid transmission of coronavirus\ndisease. Due to its contagious nature, the virus can easily infect an\nunprotected and exposed individual from mild to severe symptoms. The study of\nthe virus effects on pregnant mothers and neonatal is now a concerning issue\nglobally among civilians and public health workers considering how the virus\nwill affect the mother and the neonates health. This paper aims to develop a\npredictive model to estimate the possibility of death for a COVID-diagnosed\nmother based on documented symptoms: dyspnea, cough, rhinorrhea, arthralgia,\nand the diagnosis of pneumonia. The machine learning models that have been used\nin our study are support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, gradient\nboosting, and artificial neural network. The models have provided impressive\nresults and can accurately predict the mortality of pregnant mothers with a\ngiven input.The precision rate for 3 models(ANN, Gradient Boost, Random Forest)\nis 100% The highest accuracy score(Gradient Boosting,ANN) is 95%,highest\nrecall(Support Vector Machine) is 92.75% and highest f1 score(Gradient\nBoosting,ANN) is 94.66%. Due to the accuracy of the model, pregnant mother can\nexpect immediate medical treatment based on their possibility of death due to\nthe virus. The model can be utilized by health workers globally to list down\nemergency patients, which can ultimately reduce the death rate of COVID-19\ndiagnosed pregnant mothers.",

The challenges in reconstructing\nliquids, which is not faced in previous reconstruction works on rigid and\ndeforming surfaces, lies in the inability to use depth sensing and color\nfeatures due the variable index of refraction, opacity, and environmental\nreflections. Therefore, we limit ourselves to only surface detections (i.e.\nbinary mask) of liquids as observations and do not assume any prior knowledge\non the liquids properties. A novel optimization problem is posed which\nreconstructs the liquid as particles by minimizing the error between a rendered\nsurface from the particles and the surface detections while satisfying liquid\nconstraints.

However, such realization is also a challenging\nproblem due to the physical limitations of nanometer-sized designs such as in\ncomputation, sensory and perception as well as actuation. This paper proposes a\ntheoretical foundation for solving this problem based on a novel notion of\ndistributed swarm computing by basis agents (BAs). The proposed BA is an\nabstract model for nanorobots that can compute a very simple basis function\ncalled B-function. It is mathematically shown here that a swarm of BAs has the\nuniversal function approximation property and can accurately approximate\nfunctions. It is then analytically demonstrated that a swarm of BAs can be\neasily reprogrammed to compute desired functions simply by adjusting the\nconcentrations of BAs in the environment. We further propose a specific\nstructure for BAs which enable them to perform distributed computing such as in\nthe aqueous environment of living tissues and nanomedicine. The hardware\ncomplexity of this structure aims to remain low to be more reasonably\nrealizable by today technology.

    "title": "Blockchain-based Recommender Systems: Applications, Challenges and  Future Opportunities",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been widely used in different application domains\nincluding energy-preservation, e-commerce, healthcare, social media, etc. Such\napplications require the analysis and mining of massive amounts of various\ntypes of user data, including demographics, preferences, social interactions,\netc. in order to develop accurate and precise recommender systems. Such\ndatasets often include sensitive information, yet most recommender systems are\nfocusing on the models' accuracy and ignore issues related to security and the\nusers' privacy. Despite the efforts to overcome these problems using different\nrisk reduction techniques, none of them has been completely successful in\nensuring cryptographic security and protection of the users' private\ninformation. To bridge this gap, the blockchain technology is presented as a\npromising strategy to promote security and privacy preservation in recommender\nsystems, not only because of its security and privacy salient features, but\nalso due to its resilience, adaptability, fault tolerance and trust\ncharacteristics. This paper presents a holistic review of blockchain-based\nrecommender systems covering challenges, open issues and solutions.\nAccordingly, a well-designed taxonomy is introduced to describe the security\nand privacy challenges, overview existing frameworks and discuss their\napplications and benefits when using blockchain before indicating opportunities\nfor future research.",

    "abstract": "With the great success of deep learning in various domains, graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) also become a dominant approach to graph classification. By the\nhelp of a global readout operation that simply aggregates all node (or\nnode-cluster) representations, existing GNN classifiers obtain a graph-level\nrepresentation of an input graph and predict its class label using the\nrepresentation. However, such global aggregation does not consider the\nstructural information of each node, which results in information loss on the\nglobal structure. Particularly, it limits the discrimination power by enforcing\nthe same weight parameters of the classifier for all the node representations;\nin practice, each of them contributes to target classes differently depending\non its structural semantic. In this work, we propose structural semantic\nreadout (SSRead) to summarize the node representations at the position-level,\nwhich allows to model the position-specific weight parameters for\nclassification as well as to effectively capture the graph semantic relevant to\nthe global structure. Given an input graph, SSRead aims to identify\nstructurally-meaningful positions by using the semantic alignment between its\nnodes and structural prototypes, which encode the prototypical features of each\nposition. The structural prototypes are optimized to minimize the alignment\ncost for all training graphs, while the other GNN parameters are trained to\npredict the class labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that SSRead\nsignificantly improves the classification performance and interpretability of\nGNN classifiers while being compatible with a variety of aggregation functions,\nGNN architectures, and learning frameworks.",

We learn a\nlow-dimensional encoding of the environment, meant to capture summarizing\nabstractions, from which the internal dynamics and value functions are learned.\nTransfer is then obtained by freezing the learned internal dynamics and value\nfunctions, thus reusing the shared low-dimensional embedding space. When\nretraining the encoder for transfer, we make several observations: (i) in some\ncases, there are local minima that have small losses but a mismatching\nembedding space, resulting in poor task performance and (ii) in the absence of\nlocal minima, the output of the encoder converges in our experiments to the\nsame embedding space, which leads to a fast and efficient transfer as compared\nto learning from scratch. The local minima are caused by the reduced degree of\nfreedom of the optimization process caused by the frozen models.

Various LDP protocols\nhave been developed for different types of data such as categorical data,\nnumerical data, and key-value data. Due to their distributed settings, LDP\nprotocols are fundamentally vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which fake\nusers manipulate the server's analytics results via sending carefully crafted\ndata to the server. However, existing poisoning attacks focused on LDP\nprotocols for simple data types such as categorical and numerical data, leaving\nthe security of LDP protocols for more advanced data types such as key-value\ndata unexplored.\nIn this work, we aim to bridge the gap by introducing novel poisoning attacks\nto LDP protocols for key-value data. In such a LDP protocol, a server aims to\nsimultaneously estimate the frequency and mean value of each key among some\nusers, each of whom possesses a set of key-value pairs. Our poisoning attacks\naim to simultaneously maximize the frequencies and mean values of some\nattacker-chosen target keys via sending carefully crafted data from some fake\nusers to the sever. Specifically, since our attacks have two objectives, we\nformulate them as a two-objective optimization problem. Moreover, we propose a\nmethod to approximately solve the two-objective optimization problem, from\nwhich we obtain the optimal crafted data the fake users should send to the\nserver. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks to three LDP protocols\nfor key-value data both theoretically and empirically.

    "abstract": "Vision-based semantic segmentation of waterbodies and nearby related objects\nprovides important information for managing water resources and handling\nflooding emergency. However, the lack of large-scale labeled training and\ntesting datasets for water-related categories prevents researchers from\nstudying water-related issues in the computer vision field. To tackle this\nproblem, we present ATLANTIS, a new benchmark for semantic segmentation of\nwaterbodies and related objects. ATLANTIS consists of 5,195 images of\nwaterbodies, as well as high quality pixel-level manual annotations of 56\nclasses of objects, including 17 classes of man-made objects, 18 classes of\nnatural objects and 21 general classes. We analyze ATLANTIS in detail and\nevaluate several state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks on our\nbenchmark. In addition, a novel deep neural network, AQUANet, is developed for\nwaterbody semantic segmentation by processing the aquatic and non-aquatic\nregions in two different paths. AQUANet also incorporates low-level feature\nmodulation and cross-path modulation for enhancing feature representation.\nExperimental results show that the proposed AQUANet outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks on ATLANTIS. We claim that\nATLANTIS is the largest waterbody image dataset for semantic segmentation\nproviding a wide range of water and water-related classes and it will benefit\nresearchers of both computer vision and water resources engineering.",

In this paper, we propose a\ngeneral, fine-grained structured pruning scheme and corresponding compiler\noptimizations that are applicable to any type of DNN layer while achieving high\naccuracy and hardware inference performance. With the flexibility of applying\ndifferent pruning schemes to different layers enabled by our compiler\noptimizations, we further probe into the new problem of determining the\nbest-suited pruning scheme considering the different acceleration and accuracy\nperformance of various pruning schemes.

In the temporal dimension, we keep the frames that are\nmost relevant for recognizing action categories, while in the spatial\ndimension, we identify the most discriminative region in feature maps without\naffecting spatial context used in a hierarchical way in most video\ntransformers.

Different\nfrom the existing works on passive IRS-aided WPCNs, this is the first work that\nintroduces the active IRS in WPCNs. To guarantee the fairness, the problem is\nformulated as an amplifying power-limited weighted sum throughput (WST)\nmaximization problem, which is solved by successive convex approximation\ntechnique and fractional programming alternatively. To balance the performance\nand complexity tradeoff, three beamforming setups are considered at the active\nIRS, namely user-adaptive IRS beamforming, uplink-adaptive IRS beamforming, and\nstatic IRS beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate the significant\nsuperiority of employing active IRS in WPCNs and the benefits of dynamic IRS\nbeamforming. Specifically, it is found that compared to the passive IRS, active\nIRS not only improves the WST greatly, but also is more energy-efficient and\ncan significantly extend the transmission coverage. Moreover, different from\nthe symmetric deployment strategy of passive IRS, it is more preferable to\ndeploy the active IRS near the devices.",

Timely detection and monitoring of\ncracks are crucial to managing these risks, especially if the systems can be\nmade highly automated through robots. Vision-based crack detection algorithms\nusing deep neural networks have exhibited promise for structured surfaces such\nas walls or civil engineering tunnels, but little work has addressed highly\nunstructured environments such as rock cliffs and bare mining tunnels. To\naddress this challenge, this paper presents PointCrack3D, a new\n3D-point-cloud-based crack detection algorithm for unstructured surfaces. The\nmethod comprises three key components: an adaptive down-sampling method that\nmaintains sufficient crack point density, a DNN that classifies each point as\ncrack or non-crack, and a post-processing clustering method that groups crack\npoints into crack instances. The method was validated experimentally on a new\nlarge natural rock dataset, comprising coloured LIDAR point clouds spanning\nmore than 900 m^2 and 412 individual cracks. Results demonstrate a crack\ndetection rate of 97% overall and 100% for cracks with a maximum width of more\nthan 3 cm, significantly outperforming the state of the art. Furthermore, for\ncross-validation, PointCrack3D was applied to an entirely new dataset acquired\nin different locations and not used at all in training and shown to detect 100%\nof its crack instances. We also characterise the relationship between detection\nperformance, crack width and number of points per crack, providing a foundation\nupon which to make decisions about both practical deployments and future\nresearch directions.",

Our principal\ncontributions include a generalized model of Markov entropic centrality with\nthe flexibility to tune the importance of node degrees, edge weights and\ndirections, with a closed-form asymptotic analysis. It leads to a novel\ntwo-stage graph clustering algorithm. The centrality analysis helps reason\nabout the suitability of our approach to cluster a given graph, and determine\n`query' nodes, around which to explore local community structures, leading to\nan agglomerative clustering mechanism. The entropic centrality computations are\namortized by our clustering algorithm, making it computationally efficient:\ncompared to prior approaches using Markov entropic centrality for clustering,\nour experiments demonstrate multiple orders of magnitude of speed-up. Our\nclustering algorithm naturally inherits the flexibility to accommodate edge\ndirectionality, as well as different interpretations and interplay between edge\nweights and node degrees. Overall, this paper thus not only makes significant\ntheoretical and conceptual contributions, but also translates the findings into\nartifacts of practical relevance, yielding new, effective and scalable\ncentrality computations and graph clustering algorithms, whose efficacy has\nbeen validated through extensive benchmarking experiments.",

    "abstract": "Recently, template-based trackers have become the leading tracking algorithms\nwith promising performance in terms of efficiency and accuracy. However, the\ncorrelation operation between query feature and the given template only\nexploits accurate target localization, leading to state estimation error\nespecially when the target suffers from severe deformable variations. To\naddress this issue, segmentation-based trackers have been proposed that employ\nper-pixel matching to improve the tracking performance of deformable objects\neffectively. However, most of existing trackers only refer to the target\nfeatures in the initial frame, thereby lacking the discriminative capacity to\nhandle challenging factors, e.g., similar distractors, background clutter,\nappearance change, etc. To this end, we propose a dynamic compact memory\nembedding to enhance the discrimination of the segmentation-based deformable\nvisual tracking method. Specifically, we initialize a memory embedding with the\ntarget features in the first frame. During the tracking process, the current\ntarget features that have high correlation with existing memory are updated to\nthe memory embedding online. To further improve the segmentation accuracy for\ndeformable objects, we employ a point-to-global matching strategy to measure\nthe correlation between the pixel-wise query features and the whole template,\nso as to capture more detailed deformation information. Extensive evaluations\non six challenging tracking benchmarks including VOT2016, VOT2018, VOT2019,\nGOT-10K, TrackingNet, and LaSOT demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nrecent remarkable trackers. Besides, our method outperforms the excellent\nsegmentation-based trackers, i.e., D3S and SiamMask on DAVIS2017 benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive progress on image generation, deep generative models are\nsuboptimal when applied to lossless compression. For example, models such as\nVAEs suffer from a compression cost overhead due to their latent variables that\ncan only be partially eliminated with elaborated schemes such as bits-back\ncoding, resulting in oftentimes poor single-sample compression rates. To\novercome such problems, we establish a new class of tractable lossless\ncompression models that permit efficient encoding and decoding: Probabilistic\nCircuits (PCs). These are a class of neural networks involving $|p|$\ncomputational units that support efficient marginalization over arbitrary\nsubsets of the $D$ feature dimensions, enabling efficient arithmetic coding. We\nderive efficient encoding and decoding schemes that both have time complexity\n$\\mathcal{O} (\\log(D) \\cdot |p|)$, where a naive scheme would have linear costs\nin $D$ and $|p|$, making the approach highly scalable. Empirically, our\nPC-based (de)compression algorithm runs 5-20x faster than neural compression\nalgorithms that achieve similar bitrates. By scaling up the traditional PC\nstructure learning pipeline, we achieved state-of-the-art results on image\ndatasets such as MNIST. Furthermore, PCs can be naturally integrated with\nexisting neural compression algorithms to improve the performance of these base\nmodels on natural image datasets.

On\nthe other hand, terahertz (THz) enabled intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is\nexpected to be one of the core enabling technologies for forthcoming beyond-5G\nwireless communications that promise a broad range of data-demand applications.\nIn this paper, we propose a UAV-mounted IRS (UIRS) communication system over\nTHz bands for confidential data dissemination from an access point (AP) towards\nmultiple ground user equipments (UEs) in IoT networks. Specifically, the AP\nintends to send data to the scheduled UE, while unscheduled UEs may pose\npotential adversaries.

We then formulate a novel minimum average\nenergy efficiency (mAEE) optimization problem, targetting to improve the covert\nthroughput and reduce UAVs' propulsion energy consumption subject to the\ncovertness requirement, which is determined analytically. Since the\noptimization problem is non-convex, we tackle it via the block successive\nconvex approximation (BSCA) approach to iteratively solve a sequence of\napproximated convex sub-problems, designing the binary user scheduling, AP's\npower allocation, maximum AN jamming power, IRS beamforming, and both UAVs'\ntrajectory planning.

As a well studied\nproperty for CNN-based models, the receptive field is a measurement for\nmeasuring the spatial range covered by a single feature response, which is\ncrucial in improving the image categorization accuracy. In video domain, video\nevent semantics are actually described by complex interaction among different\nconcepts, while their behaviors vary drastically from one video to another,\nleading to the difficulty in concept-based analytics for accurate event\ncategorization. To model the concept behavior, we study temporal concept\nreceptive field of concept-based event representation, which encodes the\ntemporal occurrence pattern of different mid-level concepts. Accordingly, we\nintroduce temporal dynamic convolution (TDC) to give stronger flexibility to\nconcept-based event analytics. TDC can adjust the temporal concept receptive\nfield size dynamically according to different inputs.

    "abstract": "Object detection has achieved substantial progress in the last decade.\nHowever, detecting novel classes with only few samples remains challenging,\nsince deep learning under low data regime usually leads to a degraded feature\nspace. Existing works employ a holistic fine-tuning paradigm to tackle this\nproblem, where the model is first pre-trained on all base classes with abundant\nsamples, and then it is used to carve the novel class feature space.\nNonetheless, this paradigm is still imperfect. Durning fine-tuning, a novel\nclass may implicitly leverage the knowledge of multiple base classes to\nconstruct its feature space, which induces a scattered feature space, hence\nviolating the inter-class separability. To overcome these obstacles, we propose\na two-step fine-tuning framework, Few-shot object detection via Association and\nDIscrimination (FADI), which builds up a discriminative feature space for each\nnovel class with two integral steps. 1) In the association step, in contrast to\nimplicitly leveraging multiple base classes, we construct a compact novel class\nfeature space via explicitly imitating a specific base class feature space.\nSpecifically, we associate each novel class with a base class according to\ntheir semantic similarity. After that, the feature space of a novel class can\nreadily imitate the well-trained feature space of the associated base class. 2)\nIn the discrimination step, to ensure the separability between the novel\nclasses and associated base classes, we disentangle the classification branches\nfor base and novel classes. To further enlarge the inter-class separability\nbetween all classes, a set-specialized margin loss is imposed. Extensive\nexperiments on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate FADI achieves new\nSOTA performance, significantly improving the baseline in any shot/split by\n+18.7.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we provide an optimal additive noise mechanism for database\nqueries with discrete answers on a finite support. The noise provides the\nminimum error rate for a given $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$ pair. Popular schemes apply\nrandom additive noise with infinite support and then clamp the resulting query\nresponse to the desired range. Clamping, unfortunately, compromises the privacy\nguarantees. Using modulo addition, rather than clamping, we show that, for any\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$ pair, the optimum additive noise distribution can be\nobtained by solving a mixed integer linear program (MILP). Having introduced\nour optimal noise design formulation, we derive closed form solutions for the\noptimal noise probability mass function (PMF) and the probability of error for\ntwo special cases. In our performance studies, we show that the proposed\noptimal mechanism outperforms state of the art for a given probability of error\nand for any budget $\\epsilon >0$.",

    "abstract": "Producing diverse and realistic images with generative models such as GANs\ntypically requires large scale training with vast amount of images. GANs\ntrained with extremely limited data can easily overfit to few training samples\nand display undesirable properties like \"stairlike\" latent space where\ntransitions in latent space suffer from discontinuity, occasionally yielding\nabrupt changes in outputs. In this work, we consider the situation where\nneither large scale dataset of our interest nor transferable source dataset is\navailable, and seek to train existing generative models with minimal\noverfitting and mode collapse. We propose latent mixup-based distance\nregularization on the feature space of both a generator and the counterpart\ndiscriminator that encourages the two players to reason not only about the\nscarce observed data points but the relative distances in the feature space\nthey reside. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation on diverse datasets\ndemonstrates that our method is generally applicable to existing models to\nenhance both fidelity and diversity under the constraint of limited data.

    "abstract": "Two current methods used to train autonomous cars are reinforcement learning\nand imitation learning. This research develops a new learning methodology and\nsystematic approach in both a simulated and a smaller real world environment by\nintegrating supervised imitation learning into reinforcement learning to make\nthe RL training data collection process more effective and efficient. By\ncombining the two methods, the proposed research successfully leverages the\nadvantages of both RL and IL methods. First, a real mini-scale robot car was\nassembled and trained on a 6 feet by 9 feet real world track using imitation\nlearning. During the process, a handle controller was used to control the\nmini-scale robot car to drive on the track by imitating a human expert driver\nand manually recorded the actions using Microsoft AirSim's API. 331 accurate\nhuman-like reward training samples were able to be generated and collected.\nThen, an agent was trained in the Microsoft AirSim simulator using\nreinforcement learning for 6 hours with the initial 331 reward data inputted\nfrom imitation learning training. After a 6-hour training period, the\nmini-scale robot car was able to successfully drive full laps around the 6 feet\nby 9 feet track autonomously while the mini-scale robot car was unable to\ncomplete one full lap round the track even after 30 hour training pure RL\ntraining. With 80% less training time, the new methodology produced\nsignificantly more average rewards per hour. Thus, the new methodology was able\nto save a significant amount of training time and can be used to accelerate the\nadoption of RL in autonomous driving, which would help produce more efficient\nand better results in the long run when applied to real life scenarios.\nKey Words: Reinforcement Learning (RL), Imitation Learning (IL), Autonomous\nDriving, Human Driving Data, CNN",

Thus, MF has drawn wide\nattention for low-rank analysis of sparse big data, e.g., Collaborative\nFiltering (CF) Recommender Systems, Social Networks, and Quality of Service.\nHowever, the following two problems exist: 1) huge computational overhead for\nthe construction of the Graph Similarity Matrix (GSM), and 2) huge memory\noverhead for the intermediate GSM. Therefore, GSM-based MF, e.g., kernel MF,\ngraph regularized MF, etc., cannot be directly applied to the low-rank analysis\nof sparse big data on cloud and edge platforms. To solve this intractable\nproblem for sparse big data analysis, we propose Locality Sensitive Hashing\n(LSH) aggregated MF (LSH-MF), which can solve the following problems: 1) The\nproposed probabilistic projection strategy of LSH-MF can avoid the construction\nof the GSM.

In contrast, humans\nevolve useful strategies in such social dilemmas.

    "abstract": "Fast and reliable prediction of river flow velocities is important in many\napplications, including flood risk management. The shallow water equations\n(SWEs) are commonly used for this purpose. However, traditional numerical\nsolvers of the SWEs are computationally expensive and require high-resolution\nriverbed profile measurement (bathymetry). In this work, we propose a two-stage\nprocess in which, first, using the principal component geostatistical approach\n(PCGA) we estimate the probability density function of the bathymetry from flow\nvelocity measurements, and then use machine learning (ML) algorithms to obtain\na fast solver for the SWEs. The fast solver uses realizations from the\nposterior bathymetry distribution and takes as input the prescribed range of\nBCs. The first stage allows us to predict flow velocities without direct\nmeasurement of the bathymetry. Furthermore, we augment the bathymetry posterior\ndistribution to a more general class of distributions before providing them as\ninputs to ML algorithm in the second stage. This allows the solver to\nincorporate future direct bathymetry measurements into the flow velocity\nprediction for improved accuracy, even if the bathymetry changes over time\ncompared to its original indirect estimation. We propose and benchmark three\ndifferent solvers, referred to as PCA-DNN (principal component analysis-deep\nneural network), SE (supervised encoder), and SVE (supervised variational\nencoder), and validate them on the Savannah river, Augusta, GA. Our results\nshow that the fast solvers are capable of predicting flow velocities for\ndifferent bathymetry and BCs with good accuracy, at a computational cost that\nis significantly lower than the cost of solving the full boundary value problem\nwith traditional methods.",

The\nrise of cheap and usable surveillance technologies such as remotely piloted\naircraft systems (RPAS) presents value conflicts not addressed in international\nbiosurveillance guidelines. The costs of keeping agriculture pest-free include\nprivacy violations and reduced autonomy for farmers. We argue that physical and\ndigital privacy in the age of ubiquitous aerial and ground surveillance is a\nnatural right to allow people to function freely on their land. Surveillance\nmethods must be co-created and justified through using ethically defensible\nprocesses such as discourse theory, value-centred design and responsible\ninnovation to forge a cooperative social contract between diverse stakeholders.\nWe propose an ethical framework for biosurveillance activities that balances\nthe collective benefits for food security with individual privacy: (1)\nestablish the boundaries of a biosurveillance social contract; (2) justify\nsurveillance operations for the farmers, researchers, industry, the public and\nregulators; (3) give decision makers a reasonable measure of control over their\npersonal and agricultural data; and (4) choose surveillance methodologies that\ngive the appropriate information. The benefits of incorporating an ethical\nframework for responsible biosurveillance innovation include increased\nparticipation and accumulated trust over time. Long term trust and cooperation\nwill support food security, producing higher quality data overall and\nmitigating against anticipated information gaps that may emerge due to\ndisrespecting landholder rights",

While this coupling of industrial components provides many\nbenefits, it also introduces serious security challenges. Although sharing many\nsimilarities with the consumer Internet of Things, securing the Industrial\nInternet of Things introduces its own challenges but also opportunities, mainly\nresulting from a longer lifetime of components and a larger scale of networks.\nIn this paper, we identify the unique security goals and challenges of the\nIndustrial Internet of Things, which, unlike consumer deployments, mainly\nfollow from safety and productivity requirements. To address these security\ngoals and challenges, we provide a comprehensive survey of research efforts to\nsecure the Industrial Internet of Things, discuss their applicability, and\nanalyze their security benefits.",

    "abstract": "We consider a class of systems with time-varying parameters, which are\nwritten as linear regressions with bounded disturbances. The task is to\nestimate such parameters under the condition that the regressor is finitely\nexciting (FE). Considering such a problem statement, a new robust method is\nproposed to identify the time-varying parameters with bounded error, which\ncould be reduced to the limit by the adjustment of such method parameters. For\nthis purpose, the function of the system unknown parameters, which depends on\ntime, is expanded into a Taylor series in order to turn the considered problem\ninto the identification of the regression with piecewise-constant parameters.\nThis results in the increase of the dimensionality of the problem to be solved.\nThen, the I-DREM procedure with exponential forgetting, resetting, and\nnormalization of the regressor, which has been proposed earlier by the authors,\nis applied to the obtained regression. This allows one, in contrast to the\nknown solutions, to get the dimensionality of the problem back to the initial\none and provide the required exponential convergence of the parameter error to\na bounded set with adjustable bound under the condition that the regressor is\nFE. In addition, this method guarantees that the parameter error is bounded\nbeyond the regressor excitation interval. The above properties are proved\nanalytically and shown via numerical simulations.",

The high cost and\ncomplex logistics of direct bathymetry surveys, i.e., depth imaging, have\nencouraged the use of indirect measurements such as surface flow velocities.\nHowever, estimating high-resolution bathymetry from indirect measurements is an\ninverse problem that can be computationally challenging. Here, we propose a\nreduced-order model (ROM) based approach that utilizes a variational\nautoencoder (VAE), a type of deep neural network with a narrow layer in the\nmiddle, to compress bathymetry and flow velocity information and accelerate\nbathymetry inverse problems from flow velocity measurements. In our\napplication, the shallow-water equations (SWE) with appropriate boundary\nconditions (BCs), e.g., the discharge and/or the free surface elevation,\nconstitute the forward problem, to predict flow velocity. Then, ROMs of the\nSWEs are constructed on a nonlinear manifold of low dimensionality through a\nvariational encoder. Estimation with uncertainty quantification (UQ) is\nperformed on the low-dimensional latent space in a Bayesian setting. We have\ntested our inversion approach on a one-mile reach of the Savannah River, GA,\nUSA. Once the neural network is trained (offline stage), the proposed technique\ncan perform the inversion operation orders of magnitude faster than traditional\ninversion methods that are commonly based on linear projections, such as\nprincipal component analysis (PCA), or the principal component geostatistical\napproach (PCGA).

    "abstract": "Camera gimbal systems are important in various air or water borne systems for\napplications such as navigation, target tracking, security and surveillance. A\nhigher steering rate (rotation angle per second) of gimbal is preferable for\nreal-time applications since a given field-of-view (FOV) can be revisited\nwithin a short period of time. However, due to relative motion between the\ngimbal and scene during the exposure time, the captured video frames can suffer\nfrom motion blur. Since most of the post-capture applications require blurfree\nimages, motion deblurring in real-time is an important need. Even though there\nexist blind deblurring methods which aim to retrieve latent images from blurry\ninputs, they are constrained by very high-dimensional optimization thus\nincurring large execution times. On the other hand, deep learning methods for\nmotion deblurring, though fast, do not generalize satisfactorily to different\ndomains (e.g., air, water, etc). In this work, we address the problem of\nreal-time motion deblurring in infrared (IR) images captured by a gimbal-based\nsystem. We reveal how a priori knowledge of the blur-kernel can be used in\nconjunction with non-blind deblurring methods to achieve real-time performance.\nImportantly, our mathematical model can be leveraged to create large-scale\ndatasets with realistic gimbal motion blur. Such datasets which are a rarity\ncan be a valuable asset for contemporary deep learning methods. We show that,\nin comparison to the state-of-the-art techniques in deblurring, our method is\nbetter suited for practical gimbal-based imaging systems.",

To address this, we propose to a)\nperform a multilinear decomposition of the tensor of intermediate\nrepresentations, and b) use a tensor-based regression to map directions found\nusing this decomposition to the latent space. Our scheme allows for both linear\nedits corresponding to the individual modes of the tensor, and non-linear ones\nthat model the multiplicative interactions between them. We show experimentally\nthat we can utilise the former to better separate style- from geometry-based\ntransformations, and the latter to generate an extended set of possible\ntransformations in comparison to prior works.

In this paper, an adaptive\nweighting visual-LiDAR fusion method, named AdaFusion, is proposed to learn the\nweights for both images and point cloud features. Features of these two\nmodalities are thus contributed differently according to the current\nenvironmental situation. The learning of weights is achieved by the attention\nbranch of the network, which is then fused with the multi-modality feature\nextraction branch.

Many of the forefront applications\nof RL involve multiple agents, e.g., playing chess and Go games, autonomous\ndriving, and robotics. Unfortunately, the framework upon which classical RL\nbuilds is inappropriate for multi-agent learning, as it assumes an agent's\nenvironment is stationary and does not take into account the adaptivity of\nother agents. In this review paper, we present the model of stochastic games\nfor multi-agent learning in dynamic environments. We focus on the development\nof simple and independent learning dynamics for stochastic games: each agent is\nmyopic and chooses best-response type actions to other agents' strategy without\nany coordination with her opponent. There has been limited progress on\ndeveloping convergent best-response type independent learning dynamics for\nstochastic games. We present our recently proposed simple and independent\nlearning dynamics that guarantee convergence in zero-sum stochastic games,\ntogether with a review of other contemporaneous algorithms for dynamic\nmulti-agent learning in this setting. Along the way, we also reexamine some\nclassical results from both the game theory and RL literature, to situate both\nthe conceptual contributions of our independent learning dynamics, and the\nmathematical novelties of our analysis.

In this paper, we present a Residual Fast Fourier Transform\nwith Convolution Block (Res FFT-Conv Block), capable of capturing both\nlong-term and short-term interactions, while integrating both low- and\nhigh-frequency residual information. Res FFT-Conv Block is a conceptually\nsimple yet computationally efficient, and plug-and-play block, leading to\nremarkable performance gains in different architectures. With Res FFT-Conv\nBlock, we further propose a Deep Residual Fourier Transformation (DeepRFT)\nframework, based upon MIMO-UNet, achieving state-of-the-art image deblurring\nperformance on GoPro, HIDE, RealBlur and DPDD datasets. Experiments show our\nDeepRFT can boost image deblurring performance significantly (e.g., with 1.09\ndB improvement in PSNR on GoPro dataset compared with MIMO-UNet), and DeepRFT+\neven reaches 33.23 dB in PSNR on GoPro dataset.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is an effective and stable method for model\ncompression via knowledge transfer. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) is\nto transfer knowledge from a large and well pre-trained teacher network to a\nsmall student network, which is a one-way process. Recently, deep mutual\nlearning (DML) has been proposed to help student networks learn collaboratively\nand simultaneously. However, to the best of our knowledge, KD and DML have\nnever been jointly explored in a unified framework to solve the knowledge\ndistillation problem. In this paper, we investigate that the teacher model\nsupports more trustworthy supervision signals in KD, while the student captures\nmore similar behaviors from the teacher in DML. Based on these observations, we\nfirst propose to combine KD with DML in a unified framework. Furthermore, we\npropose a Semi-Online Knowledge Distillation (SOKD) method that effectively\nimproves the performance of the student and the teacher. In this method, we\nintroduce the peer-teaching training fashion in DML in order to alleviate the\nstudent's imitation difficulty, and also leverage the supervision signals\nprovided by the well-trained teacher in KD. Besides, we also show our framework\ncan be easily extended to feature-based distillation methods. Extensive\nexperiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the proposed method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Although neural networks are powerful function approximators, the underlying\nmodelling assumptions ultimately define the likelihood and thus the hypothesis\nclass they are parameterizing. In classification, these assumptions are minimal\nas the commonly employed softmax is capable of representing any categorical\ndistribution. In regression, however, restrictive assumptions on the type of\ncontinuous distribution to be realized are typically placed, like the dominant\nchoice of training via mean-squared error and its underlying Gaussianity\nassumption. Recently, modelling advances allow to be agnostic to the type of\ncontinuous distribution to be modelled, granting regression the flexibility of\nclassification models. While past studies stress the benefit of such flexible\nregression models in terms of performance, here we study the effect of the\nmodel choice on uncertainty estimation. We highlight that under model\nmisspecification, aleatoric uncertainty is not properly captured, and that a\nBayesian treatment of a misspecified model leads to unreliable epistemic\nuncertainty estimates. Overall, our study provides an overview on how modelling\nchoices in regression may influence uncertainty estimation and thus any\ndownstream decision making process.",

This is epitomized by an agreement between the Scottish\nGovernment and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) that at\nleast 1% of local authority budgets will be subject to PB. This ongoing\nresearch paper explores the challenges that emerge from this 'scaling up' or\n'mainstreaming' across the 32 local authorities that make up Scotland. The main\nobjective is to evaluate local authority use of the digital platform Consul,\nwhich applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to address these challenges.\nThis project adopts a qualitative longitudinal design with interviews,\nobservations of PB processes, and analysis of the digital platform data.\nThematic analysis is employed to capture the major issues and themes which\nemerge.

The\npotential for 32 live study sites provides a unique opportunity to explore\ndiscrete political and social contexts which materialize and allow for a deeper\ndive into the challenges and issues that may exist, something a wider\ncross-sectional study would miss.

To solve this challenge, we propose a\nnew data-driven registration algorithm by investigating deep generative neural\nnetworks to point cloud registration. Given two point clouds, the motivation is\nto generate the aligned point clouds directly, which is very useful in many\napplications like 3D matching and search. We design an end-to-end generative\nneural network for aligned point clouds generation to achieve this motivation,\ncontaining three novel components. Firstly, a point multi-perception layer\n(MLP) mixer (PointMixer) network is proposed to efficiently maintain both the\nglobal and local structure information at multiple levels from the self point\nclouds. Secondly, a feature interaction module is proposed to fuse information\nfrom cross point clouds. Thirdly, a parallel and differential sample consensus\nmethod is proposed to calculate the transformation matrix of the input point\nclouds based on the generated registration results. The proposed generative\nneural network is trained in a GAN framework by maintaining the data\ndistribution and structure similarity. The experiments on both ModelNet40 and\n7Scene datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.

    "title": "Techno-economic analysis of Power-to-Gas plants in a gas and electricity  distribution network system with high renewable energy penetration",
    "abstract": "Distributed generation, based on the exploitation of Renewable Energy Sources\n(RES), has increased in the last few decades to limit anthropogenic carbon\ndioxide emissions, and this trend will increase in the future. However, RES\ngeneration is not dispatchable, and an increasing share of RES may lead to\ninefficiencies and even problems for the electricity network. Flexible\nresources are needed to handle RES generation in order to support the delicate\nelectricity generation and demand balance. Energy conversion technologies (P2X,\nPower to X) allow the flexibility of energy systems to be increased. These\ntechnologies make a connection between different energy sectors (e.g.,\nelectricity and gas) possible, and thus create new synergies within an overall\nmulti energy system. This paper analyzes how the P2G technology can be used at\nthe distribution network level (both gas and electricity) to optimize the use\nof RES. In fact, in order to coordinate P2X resources, it is necessary to take\ninto account the whole multi energy scenario, and not just the electrical side:\nit therefore becomes fundamental to recognize the pros and cons that Balancing\nService Providers (BSPs), composed of a number of P2G plants (representing the\nBalancing Responsible Providers, BRPs), may have when offering services to an\nelectricity network. Moreover, the convenience of the decarbonization of the\ngas grid has been evaluated through the calculation of the levelized cost of\nSynthetic Natural Gas (LCSNG) for cost scenarios for the years 2030 and 2050,\nconsidering different assumptions about the cost of the surplus utilization of\nRES. The results show that LCSNG may vary from 47 to 319 EURO/MWh, according to\nthe different configurations, i.e., only in the best case scenario is the SNG\ncost comparable with the cost of natural gas, and hence does the P2G technology\nresult to be profitable",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive performance over various\ncomputer vision tasks. However, modeling global correlations with multi-head\nself-attention (MSA) layers leads to two widely recognized issues: the massive\ncomputational resource consumption and the lack of intrinsic inductive bias for\nmodeling local visual patterns. One unified solution is to search whether to\nreplace some MSA layers with convolution-like inductive biases that are\ncomputationally efficient via neural architecture search (NAS) based pruning\nmethods. However, maintaining MSA and different candidate convolutional\noperations as separate trainable paths gives rise to expensive search cost and\nchallenging optimization. Instead, we propose a novel weight-sharing scheme\nbetween MSA and convolutional operations and cast the search problem as finding\nwhich subset of parameters to use in each MSA layer. The weight-sharing scheme\nfurther allows us to devise an automatic Single-Path Vision Transformer pruning\nmethod (SPViT) to quickly prune the pre-trained ViTs into accurate and compact\nhybrid models with significantly reduced search cost, given target efficiency\nconstraints. We conduct extensive experiments on two representative ViT models\nshowing our method achieves a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

In\nthis paper, we propose RIS-assisted receive quadrature space-shift keying\n(RIS-RQSSK), which enhances the spectral efficiency of an RIS-based index\nmodulation (IM) system by using the real and imaginary dimensions independently\nfor the purpose of IM. Therefore, the error rate performance of the system is\nimproved as all RIS elements reflect the incident transmit signal toward both\nselected receive antennas. At the receiver, a low-complexity but effective\ngreedy detector (GD) can be employed which determines the maximum energy per\ndimension at the receive antennas. A max-min optimization problem is defined to\nmaximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) components at both selected\nreceive antennas; an analytical solution is provided based on Lagrange duality.\nIn particular, the multi-variable optimization problem is shown to reduce to\nthe solution of a single-variable equation, which results in a very simple\ndesign procedure. In addition, we investigate the average bit error probability\n(ABEP) of the proposed RIS-RQSSK system and derive a closed-form approximate\nupper bound on the ABEP. We also provide extensive numerical simulations to\nvalidate our derivations. Numerical results show that the proposed RIS-RQSSK\nscheme substantially outperforms recent prominent benchmark schemes.

This paper proposes an end-to-end\nframework for NER for Indian languages in a low-resource setting by exploiting\nparallel corpora of English and Indian languages and an English NER dataset.\nThe proposed framework includes an annotation projection method that combines\nword alignment score and NER tag prediction confidence score on source language\n(English) data to generate weakly labeled data in a target Indian language. We\nemploy a variant of the Teacher-Student model and optimize it jointly on the\npseudo labels of the Teacher model and predictions on the generated weakly\nlabeled data. We also present manually annotated test sets for three Indian\nlanguages: Hindi, Bengali, and Gujarati. We evaluate the performance of the\nproposed framework on the test sets of the three Indian languages. Empirical\nresults show a minimum 10% performance improvement compared to the zero-shot\ntransfer learning model on all languages. This indicates that weakly labeled\ndata generated using the proposed annotation projection method in target Indian\nlanguages can complement well-annotated source language data to enhance\nperformance.

Thus, our technique avoids, during satisfiability checking, the\nexplicit use of proof rules based on induction over the ADTs. The main\nextension over previous techniques for ADT removal is a new transformation\nrule, called differential replacement, which allows us to introduce auxiliary\npredicates, whose definitions correspond to lemmas that are used when making\ninductive proofs. We present an algorithm that performs the automatic removal\nof ADTs by applying the new rule, together with the traditional\nfolding/unfolding rules. We prove that, under suitable hypotheses, the set of\nthe transformed clauses is satisfiable if and only if so is the set of the\noriginal clauses. By an experimental evaluation, we show that the use of the\nnew rule significantly improves the effectiveness of ADT removal.

However, the negative examples\ninevitably give rise to the class collision issue, compromising the\nrepresentation learning for clustering. In this paper, we explore\nnon-contrastive representation learning for deep clustering, termed NCC, which\nis based on BYOL, a representative method without negative examples. First, we\npropose to align one augmented view of instance with the neighbors of another\nview in the embedding space, called positive sampling strategy, which avoids\nthe class collision issue caused by the negative examples and hence improves\nthe within-cluster compactness. Second, we propose to encourage alignment\nbetween two augmented views of one prototype and uniformity among all\nprototypes, named prototypical contrastive loss or ProtoCL, which can maximize\nthe inter-cluster distance. Moreover, we formulate NCC in an\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) framework, in which E-step utilizes spherical\nk-means to estimate the pseudo-labels of instances and distribution of\nprototypes from a target network and M-step leverages the proposed losses to\noptimize an online network. As a result, NCC forms an embedding space where all\nclusters are well-separated and within-cluster examples are compact.\nExperimental results on several clustering benchmark datasets including\nImageNet-1K demonstrate that NCC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a\nsignificant margin.",

In a\nsimilar manner to how applications are optimized to improve cache utilization,\napplications also need to be optimized to improve data-locality on ccNUMA\nsystems to use larger topologies effectively.

In this paper, we point out that in\nobject detection, the features of the teacher and student vary greatly in\ndifferent areas, especially in the foreground and background. If we distill\nthem equally, the uneven differences between feature maps will negatively\naffect the distillation. Thus, we propose Focal and Global Distillation (FGD).\nFocal distillation separates the foreground and background, forcing the student\nto focus on the teacher's critical pixels and channels. Global distillation\nrebuilds the relation between different pixels and transfers it from teachers\nto students, compensating for missing global information in focal distillation.\nAs our method only needs to calculate the loss on the feature map, FGD can be\napplied to various detectors. We experiment on various detectors with different\nbackbones and the results show that the student detector achieves excellent mAP\nimprovement.

In this work, we show that UE\nlocalization with the latter approach can achieve a higher positioning\naccuracy. We propose to consider the uncertainty in the UE localization at each\nBS, such that overall UE's position is determined by combining the position\nestimates of the different BSs based on the uncertainty at each BS. With this\napproach, a more reliable position estimate can be obtained in case of\nvariations in the channel.",

    "abstract": "In this work we develop a new method, named locally permutation-equivariant\ngraph neural networks, which provides a framework for building graph neural\nnetworks that operate on local node neighbourhoods, through sub-graphs, while\nusing permutation equivariant update functions. Message passing neural networks\nhave been shown to be limited in their expressive power and recent approaches\nto over come this either lack scalability or require structural information to\nbe encoded into the feature space. The general framework presented here\novercomes the scalability issues associated with global permutation\nequivariance by operating on sub-graphs through restricted representations. In\naddition, we prove that there is no loss of expressivity by using restricted\nrepresentations. Furthermore, the proposed framework only requires a choice of\n$k$-hops for creating sub-graphs and a choice of representation space to be\nused for each layer, which makes the method easily applicable across a range of\ngraph based domains. We experimentally validate the method on a range of graph\nbenchmark classification tasks, demonstrating either state-of-the-art results\nor very competitive results on all benchmarks. Further, we demonstrate that the\nuse of local update functions offers a significant improvement in GPU memory\nover global methods.",

The sensitivity, specificity, positive and\nnegative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of predictions at two hours after HFNC\ninitiation were also evaluated. These metrics were also computed in a cohort\nwith primarily respiratory diagnoses. 834 HFNC trials [455 training, 173\nvalidation, 206 test] met the inclusion criteria, of which 175 [103, 30, 42]\n(21.0%) escalated to NIV or intubation. The LSTM models trained with transfer\nlearning generally performed better than the LR models, with the best LSTM\nmodel achieving an AUROC of 0.78, vs 0.66 for the LR, two hours after\ninitiation.

We also outline the OVBM design\nmethodology leading us to such architecture, which in general can incorporate\nmultimodal biomarkers and target simultaneously several diseases and other AI\ntasks. Key in our methodology is the use of multiple biomarkers complementing\neach other, and when two of them uniquely identify different subjects in a\ntarget disease we say they are orthogonal. We illustrate the methodology by\nintroducing 16 biomarkers, three of which are orthogonal, demonstrating\nsimultaneous above state-of-the-art discrimination for apparently unrelated\ndiseases such as AD and COVID-19. Inspired by research conducted at the MIT\nCenter for Brain Minds and Machines, OVBM combines biomarker implementations of\nthe four modules of intelligence: The brain OS chunks and overlaps audio\nsamples and aggregates biomarker features from the sensory stream and cognitive\ncore creating a multi-modal graph neural network of symbolic compositional\nmodels for the target task.

    "abstract": "Existing techniques for the cost optimization of water distribution networks\neither employ meta-heuristics, or try to develop problem-specific optimization\ntechniques. Instead, we exploit recent advances in generic NLP solvers and\nexplore a rich set of model refinement techniques. The networks that we study\ncontain a single source and multiple demand nodes with residual pressure\nconstraints. Indeterminism of flow values and flow direction in the network\nleads to non-linearity in these constraints making the optimization problem\nnon-convex. While the physical network is cyclic, flow through the network is\nnecessarily acyclic and thus enforces an acyclic orientation. We devise\ndifferent strategies of finding acyclic orientations and explore the benefit of\nenforcing such orientations explicitly as a constraint. Finally, we propose a\nparallel link formulation that models flow in each link as two separate flows\nwith opposing directions. This allows us to tackle numerical difficulties in\noptimization when flow in a link is near zero. We find that all our proposed\nformulations give results at par with least cost solutions obtained in the\nliterature on benchmark networks. We also introduce a suite of large test\nnetworks since existing benchmark networks are small in size, and find that the\nparallel link approach outperforms all other approaches on these bigger\nnetworks, resulting in a more tractable technique of cost optimization.",

The new method uses 4D\ndigital image information and information from a thresholded 4D image in a\nlocal neighborhood. Thus, the 4D image segmentation is accomplished by defining\nthe edge detector function's input as the weighted sum of the norm of gradients\nof presmoothed 4D image and norm of presmoothed thresholded 4D image in a local\nneighborhood. Additionally, we design and study a numerical method based on the\nfinite volume approach for solving the new model.

    "abstract": "Microgrids (MGs) are important players for the future transactive energy\nsystems where a number of intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) devices interact\nfor energy management in the smart grid. Although there have been many works on\nMG energy management, most studies assume a perfect communication environment,\nwhere communication failures are not considered. In this paper, we consider the\nMG as a multi-agent environment with IoT devices in which AI agents exchange\ninformation with their peers for collaboration. However, the collaboration\ninformation may be lost due to communication failures or packet loss. Such\nevents may affect the operation of the whole MG. To this end, we propose a\nmulti-agent Bayesian deep reinforcement learning (BA-DRL) method for MG energy\nmanagement under communication failures. We first define a multi-agent\npartially observable Markov decision process (MA-POMDP) to describe agents\nunder communication failures, in which each agent can update its beliefs on the\nactions of its peers. Then, we apply a double deep Q-learning (DDQN)\narchitecture for Q-value estimation in BA-DRL, and propose a belief-based\ncorrelated equilibrium for the joint-action selection of multi-agent BA-DRL.\nFinally, the simulation results show that BA-DRL is robust to both power supply\nuncertainty and communication failure uncertainty. BA-DRL has 4.1% and 10.3%\nhigher reward than Nash Deep Q-learning (Nash-DQN) and alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) respectively under 1% communication failure\nprobability.",

Though other\nnetwork models are known to be vulnerable to the backdoor attack, which embeds\ntriggers in the model and controls the model behavior when the triggers are\npresented, little is known whether such an attack is still valid on the\ntransformer models and if so, whether it can be done in a more cost-efficient\nmanner. In this paper, we propose DBIA, a novel data-free backdoor attack\nagainst the CV-oriented transformer networks, leveraging the inherent attention\nmechanism of transformers to generate triggers and injecting the backdoor using\nthe poisoned surrogate dataset. We conducted extensive experiments based on\nthree benchmark transformers, i.e., ViT, DeiT and Swin Transformer, on two\nmainstream image classification tasks, i.e., CIFAR10 and ImageNet.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have\ngreatly advanced the state-of-the-art in the detection of clouds in satellite\nimages, but existing CNN-based methods are costly as they require large amounts\nof training images with expensive pixel-level cloud labels. To alleviate this\ncost, we propose Fixed-Point GAN for Cloud Detection (FCD), a weakly-supervised\napproach. Training with only image-level labels, we learn fixed-point\ntranslation between clear and cloudy images, so only clouds are affected during\ntranslation. Doing so enables our approach to predict pixel-level cloud labels\nby translating satellite images to clear ones and setting a threshold to the\ndifference between the two images. Moreover, we propose FCD+, where we exploit\nthe label-noise robustness of CNNs to refine the prediction of FCD, leading to\nfurther improvements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the\nLandsat-8 Biome cloud detection dataset, where we obtain performance close to\nexisting fully-supervised methods that train with expensive pixel-level labels.\nBy fine-tuning our FCD+ with just 1% of the available pixel-level labels, we\nmatch the performance of fully-supervised methods.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs), huge amounts of\nroad condition data are constantly being generated and sent to the cloud for\nprocessing. However, this introduces a significant load on the network\nbandwidth causing delay in the network and for a time-critical application like\nVANET such delay may have severe impact on real-time traffic management. This\ndelay maybe reduced by offloading some computational tasks to devices as close\nas possible to the vehicles. Further, security and privacy of vehicles is\nanother important concern in such applications. Thus, this paper proposes a\nsecure road condition monitoring scheme for fog-based vehicular networks. It\nconsiders Road-Side Units (RSUs) with computational capabilities, which act as\nintermediate fog nodes in between vehicles and cloud to reduce delay in\ndecision making and thereby increases scalability. Apart from fulfilling basic\nsecurity features, our scheme also supports advanced features like\nunlinkability and untraceability. A detailed security analysis proves that the\nproposed scheme can handle both internal and external adversaries. We also\njustify the efficiency of our scheme through theoretical overhead analysis.\nFinally, the scheme is simulated using an integrated SUMO and NS-3 platform to\nshow its feasibility for practical implementations while not compromising on\nthe network performance. The results show an average 80.96\\% and 37.5\\%\nimprovement in execution time and end-to-end delay respectively while\nmaintaining at par results for packet delivery ratio over a state-of-the-art\nscheme.",

In this work, we analyze the\ncost of learning in a resource-constrained system, defining an optimization\nproblem in which training a DRL agent makes it possible to improve the resource\nallocation strategy but also reduces the number of available resources. Our\nsimulation results show that the cost of learning can be critical when\nevaluating DRL schemes on the network edge and that assuming a cost-free\nlearning model can lead to significantly overestimating performance.",

    "abstract": "The standard RSA relies on multiple big-number modular exponentiation\noperations and longer key-length is required for better protection. This\nimposes a hefty time penalty for encryption and decryption. In this study, we\nanalyzed and developed an improved parallel algorithm (PMKRSA) based on the\nidea of splitting the plaintext into multiple chunks and encrypt the chunks\nusing multiple key-pairs. The algorithm in our new scheme is so natural for\nparallelized implementation that we also investigated its parallelization in a\nGPU environment. In the following, the structure of our new scheme is outlined,\nand its correctness is proved mathematically. Then, with the algorithm\nimplemented and optimized on both CPU and CPU+GPU platforms, we showed that our\nalgorithm shortens the computational time considerably, and it has a security\nadvantage over the standard RSA as it is invulnerable to the common attacks.\nFinally, we also proved the feasibility of using our algorithm to encrypt large\nfiles through simulation. The results show that over the set of file size: 1\nMB, 10 MB, 25 MB, 50 MB, 100 MB, the average encryption and decryption time of\nthe CPU version is 0.2476s and 9.4476s, and for the CPU+GPU version, it is\n0.0009s and 0.0618s, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Recent 2D-to-3D human pose estimation works tend to utilize the graph\nstructure formed by the topology of the human skeleton. However, we argue that\nthis skeletal topology is too sparse to reflect the body structure and suffer\nfrom serious 2D-to-3D ambiguity problem. To overcome these weaknesses, we\npropose a novel graph convolution network architecture, Hierarchical Graph\nNetworks (HGN). It is based on denser graph topology generated by our\nmulti-scale graph structure building strategy, thus providing more delicate\ngeometric information. The proposed architecture contains three sparse-to-fine\nrepresentation subnetworks organized in parallel, in which multi-scale\ngraph-structured features are processed and exchange information through a\nnovel feature fusion strategy, leading to rich hierarchical representations. We\nalso introduce a 3D coarse mesh constraint to further boost detail-related\nfeature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HGN achieves the\nstate-of-the art performance with reduced network parameters",

    "abstract": "Cyber deception is emerging as a promising approach to defending networks and\nsystems against attackers and data thieves. However, despite being relatively\ncheap to deploy, the generation of realistic content at scale is very costly,\ndue to the fact that rich, interactive deceptive technologies are largely\nhand-crafted. With recent improvements in Machine Learning, we now have the\nopportunity to bring scale and automation to the creation of realistic and\nenticing simulated content. In this work, we propose a framework to automate\nthe generation of email and instant messaging-style group communications at\nscale. Such messaging platforms within organisations contain a lot of valuable\ninformation inside private communications and document attachments, making them\nan enticing target for an adversary. We address two key aspects of simulating\nthis type of system: modelling when and with whom participants communicate, and\ngenerating topical, multi-party text to populate simulated conversation\nthreads. We present the LogNormMix-Net Temporal Point Process as an approach to\nthe first of these, building upon the intensity-free modeling approach of\nShchur et al.~\\cite{shchur2019intensity} to create a generative model for\nunicast and multi-cast communications. We demonstrate the use of fine-tuned,\npre-trained language models to generate convincing multi-party conversation\nthreads. A live email server is simulated by uniting our LogNormMix-Net TPP (to\ngenerate the communication timestamp, sender and recipients) with the language\nmodel, which generates the contents of the multi-party email threads. We\nevaluate the generated content with respect to a number of realism-based\nproperties, that encourage a model to learn to generate content that will\nengage the attention of an adversary to achieve a deception outcome.",

    "abstract": "Pose variation is one of the key challenges in face recognition. Conventional\ntechniques mainly focus on face frontalization or face augmentation in image\nspace. However, transforming face images in image space is not guaranteed to\npreserve the lossless identity features of the original image. Moreover, these\nmethods suffer from more computational costs and memory requirements due to the\nadditional models. We argue that it is more desirable to perform feature\ntransformation in hierarchical feature space rather than image space, which can\ntake advantage of different feature levels and benefit from joint learning with\nrepresentation learning. To this end, we propose a lightweight and\neasy-to-implement attention block, named Pose Attention Module (PAM), for\npose-invariant face recognition. Specifically, PAM performs frontal-profile\nfeature transformation in hierarchical feature space by learning residuals\nbetween pose variations with a soft gate mechanism. We validated the\neffectiveness of PAM block design through extensive ablation studies and\nverified the performance on several popular benchmarks, including LFW, CFP-FP,\nAgeDB-30, CPLFW, and CALFW. Experimental results show that our method not only\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods but also effectively reduces memory\nrequirements by more than 75 times. It is noteworthy that our method is not\nlimited to face recognition with large pose variations. By adjusting the soft\ngate mechanism of PAM to a specific coefficient, such semantic attention block\ncan easily extend to address other intra-class imbalance problems in face\nrecognition, including large variations in age, illumination, expression, etc.",

In this paper, we define the task of image localizability,\ni.e. suitability of an image for geolocation, and propose a selective\nprediction methodology to address the task. In particular, we propose two novel\nselection functions that leverage the output probability distributions of\ngeolocation models to infer localizability at different scales. Our selection\nfunctions are benchmarked against the most widely used selective prediction\nbaselines, outperforming them in all cases.

The system\nmoves in an unknown environment and should recognize new objects located in it.\nIn this case, the system should build comprehensive images of visible things\nand memorize them if necessary (and it should also choose the current goal\nset). The main problems here are object recognition, and the informational\nreward rating in the game. Thus, the main novelty of the paper is a new method\nof evaluating the amount of visual information about the object as the reward.\nIn such a system, we suggest using a minimally pre-trained neural network to be\nresponsible for the recognition: at first, we train the network only for\nBiederman geons (geometrical primitives). The geons are generated\nprogrammatically and we demonstrate that such a trained network recognizes\ngeons in real objects quite well.

Existing 3D pose estimation suffers from 1) the inherent ambiguity\nbetween the 2D and 3D data, and 2) the lack of well labeled 2D-3D pose pairs in\nthe wild. Human beings are able to imagine the human 3D pose from a 2D image or\na set of 2D body key-points with the least ambiguity, which should be\nattributed to the prior knowledge of the human body that we have acquired in\nour mind. Inspired by this, we propose a new framework that leverages the\nlabeled 3D human poses to learn a 3D concept of the human body to reduce the\nambiguity. To have consensus on the body concept from 2D pose, our key insight\nis to treat the 2D human pose and the 3D human pose as two different domains.\nBy adapting the two domains, the body knowledge learned from 3D poses is\napplied to 2D poses and guides the 2D pose encoder to generate informative 3D\n\"imagination\" as embedding in pose lifting. Benefiting from the domain\nadaptation perspective, the proposed framework unifies the supervised and\nsemi-supervised 3D pose estimation in a principled framework. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on standard benchmarks. More importantly, it is validated that the\nexplicitly learned 3D body concept effectively alleviates the 2D-3D ambiguity\nin 2D pose lifting, improves the generalization, and enables the network to\nexploit the abundant unlabeled 2D data.",

To build the correspondence between two data\nmodalities, previous methods usually apply adversarial training to match the\nglobal shape features extracted by the encoder. However, this ignores the\ncorrespondence between multi-scaled geometric information embedded in the\npyramidal hierarchy of the decoder, which makes previous methods struggle to\ngenerate high-quality complete shapes. To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel unpaired shape completion network, named MFM-Net, using multi-stage\nfeature matching, which decomposes the learning of geometric correspondence\ninto multi-stages throughout the hierarchical generation process in the point\ncloud decoder. Specifically, MFM-Net adopts a dual path architecture to\nestablish multiple feature matching channels in different layers of the\ndecoder, which is then combined with the adversarial learning to merge the\ndistribution of features from complete and incomplete modalities. In addition,\na refinement is applied to enhance the details. As a result, MFM-Net makes use\nof a more comprehensive understanding to establish the geometric correspondence\nbetween complete and incomplete shapes in a local-to-global perspective, which\nenables more detailed geometric inference for generating high-quality complete\nshapes.

    "abstract": "Effective and timely responses to unexpected contingencies are crucial for\nenhancing the resilience of power grids. Given the fast, complex process of\ncascading propagation, corrective actions such as optimal load shedding (OLS)\nare difficult to attain in large-scale networks due to the computation\ncomplexity and communication latency issues. This work puts forth an innovative\nlearning-for-OLS approach by constructing the optimal decision rules of load\nshedding under a variety of potential contingency scenarios through offline\nneural network (NN) training. Notably, the proposed NN-based OLS decisions are\nfully decentralized, enabling individual load centers to quickly react to the\nspecific contingency using readily available local measurements. Numerical\nstudies on the IEEE 14-bus system have demonstrated the effectiveness of our\nscalable OLS design for real-time responses to severe grid emergency events.",

    "abstract": "With the growing popularity and ease of access to the internet, the problem\nof online rumors is escalating. People are relying on social media to gain\ninformation readily but fall prey to false information. There is a lack of\ncredibility assessment techniques for online posts to identify rumors as soon\nas they arrive. Existing studies have formulated several mechanisms to combat\nonline rumors by developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The\nliterature so far provides supervised frameworks for rumor classification that\nrely on huge training datasets. However, in the online scenario where\nsupervised learning is exigent, dynamic rumor identification becomes difficult.\nEarly detection of online rumors is a challenging task, and studies relating to\nthem are relatively few. It is the need of the hour to identify rumors as soon\nas they appear online. This work proposes a novel framework for unsupervised\nrumor detection that relies on an online post's content and social features\nusing state-of-the-art clustering techniques. The proposed architecture\noutperforms several existing baselines and performs better than several\nsupervised techniques. The proposed method, being lightweight, simple, and\nrobust, offers the suitability of being adopted as a tool for online rumor\nidentification.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a reinforcement learning (RL)approach to solve a\ncooperative, multi-agent Volt-Var Control (VVC) problem for high solar\npenetration distribution systems. The ingenuity of our RL method lies in a\nnovel two-stage progressive training strategy that can effectively improve\ntraining speed and convergence of the machine learning algorithm. In Stage\n1(individual training), while holding all the other agents inactive, we\nseparately train each agent to obtain its own optimal VVC actions in the action\nspace: {consume, generate, do-nothing}. In Stage 2 (cooperative training), all\nagents are trained again coordinatively to share VVC responsibility. Rewards\nand costs in our RL scheme include (i) a system-level reward (for taking an\naction), (ii) an agent-level reward (for doing-nothing), and(iii) an\nagent-level action cost function. This new framework allows rewards to be\ndynamically allocated to each agent based on their contribution while\naccounting for the trade-off between control effectiveness and action cost. The\nproposed methodology is tested and validated in a modified IEEE 123-bus system\nusing realistic PV and load profiles.

Empirical evidence has shown that the network\ntopology strongly impacts the synchronizablity of the system, and the analysis\nof their relationship remains an open challenge. We know that the eigenvalue\ndistribution determines a network's synchronizability, but analytical\nexpressions that connect network topology and all relevant eigenvalues (e.g.,\nthe extreme values) remain elusive.\nHere, we accurately determine its synchronizability by proposing an\nanalytical method to estimate the extreme eigenvalues using perturbation\ntheory. Our analytical method exposes the role global and local topology\ncombine to influence synchronizability. We show that the smallest non-zero\neigenvalue which determines synchronizability is estimated by the smallest\ndegree augmented by the inverse degree difference in the least connected nodes.\nFrom this, we can conclude that there exists a clear negative relationship\nbetween the smallest non-zero eigenvalue and the local assortativity of nodes\nwith smallest degree values. We validate the accuracy of our framework within\nthe setting of a Scale-free (SF) network and can be driven by commonly used\nODEs (e.g., 3-dimensional Rosler or Lorenz dynamics).

    "abstract": "Symbolic reasoning, rule-based symbol manipulation, is a hallmark of human\nintelligence. However, rule-based systems have had limited success competing\nwith learning-based systems outside formalized domains such as automated\ntheorem proving. We hypothesize that this is due to the manual construction of\nrules in past attempts. In this work, we ask how we can build a rule-based\nsystem that can reason with natural language input but without the manual\nconstruction of rules. We propose MetaQNL, a \"Quasi-Natural\" language that can\nexpress both formal logic and natural language sentences, and MetaInduce, a\nlearning algorithm that induces MetaQNL rules from training data consisting of\nquestions and answers, with or without intermediate reasoning steps. Our\napproach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple reasoning benchmarks;\nit learns compact models with much less data and produces not only answers but\nalso checkable proofs. Further, experiments on a real-world morphological\nanalysis benchmark show that it is possible for our method to handle noise and\nambiguity.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of controlling residential heating,\nventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) units in response to changes in\ngrid-side electrical power imbalances causing unacceptable frequency. We derive\na novel energy-based model that relates the HVAC physics-based dynamics to both\nreal and reactive power balance at the point of interconnection with the grid.\nBased on this modeling, we propose a composite control comprising of a robust\nsliding mode controller in tandem with a slower model predictive controller\nthat can achieve near-optimal physical and economic performance. In contrast to\nseveral other approaches in the literature, we analyze whether a limited number\nof HVAC units can meet the stringent performance metrics set by the\nARPA-E/NODES program on following the regulation signal, while maintaining\nconsumer comfort. Theoretical and simulation-based evidence is provided to show\nthat the proposed approach to control a single HVAC unit results in a provable\nresponse simultaneously satisfying NODES program performance metrics and\nconsumer comfort constraints.

    "abstract": "The power interactions of any component in electric energy systems with the\nrest of the system happen naturally, as governed by the energy conservation\nprinciples. However, instabilities may get induced when the dynamics of power\nproduced by local energy conversion and local control do not align with the\nincoming power dynamics from the rest of the system. To model and control such\ninstabilities, this paper introduces a notion of a common variable shared by\ncomponents called interaction variable. The same variable captures aggregate\nsystem-wide effects and sets reference points for multi-layered distributed\noutput feedback control. It has a physical interpretation of instantaneous\npower and generalized reactive power. The higher layer design utilizes the\ninteractive energy state-space model to derive intermediate reactive power\ncontrol, which becomes a control command to the lower layer physical model.\nThis command is implemented using either Feedback Linearizing Control (FBLC) or\nSliding Mode Control (SMC), for which sufficient stability conditions are\nstated. This paper proves that the proposed design is fundamental to aligning\ndynamic interactions between components for stability and feasibility. Without\nloss of generality, we utilize a simple RLC circuit with a controllable voltage\nsource for illustrations, which is a simplified representation of any\ncontrollable component in microgrids.",

    "abstract": "Pairwise learning refers to learning tasks where the loss function depends on\na pair of instances. It instantiates many important machine learning tasks such\nas bipartite ranking and metric learning. A popular approach to handle\nstreaming data in pairwise learning is an online gradient descent (OGD)\nalgorithm, where one needs to pair the current instance with a buffering set of\nprevious instances with a sufficiently large size and therefore suffers from a\nscalability issue. In this paper, we propose simple stochastic and online\ngradient descent methods for pairwise learning. A notable difference from the\nexisting studies is that we only pair the current instance with the previous\none in building a gradient direction, which is efficient in both the storage\nand computational complexity. We develop novel stability results, optimization,\nand generalization error bounds for both convex and nonconvex as well as both\nsmooth and nonsmooth problems. We introduce novel techniques to decouple the\ndependency of models and the previous instance in both the optimization and\ngeneralization analysis. Our study resolves an open question on developing\nmeaningful generalization bounds for OGD using a buffering set with a very\nsmall fixed size. We also extend our algorithms and stability analysis to\ndevelop differentially private SGD algorithms for pairwise learning which\nsignificantly improves the existing results.",

    "abstract": "One proposed mechanism of language change concerns the role played by\nsecond-language (L2) learners in situations of language contact. If\nsufficiently many L2 speakers are present in a speech community in relation to\nthe number of first-language (L1) speakers, then those features which present a\ndifficulty in L2 acquisition may be prone to disappearing from the language.\nThis paper proposes a mathematical model of such contact situations based on\nreinforcement learning and nonlinear dynamics. The equilibria of a\ndeterministic reduction of a full stochastic model, describing a mixed\npopulation of L1 and L2 speakers, are fully characterized. Whether or not the\nlanguage changes in response to the introduction of L2 learners turns out to\ndepend on three factors: the overall proportion of L2 learners in the\npopulation, the relative advantages of the linguistic variants in question, and\nthe strength of the difficulty speakers face in acquiring the language as an\nL2. These factors are related by a mathematical formula describing a phase\ntransition from retention of the L2-difficult feature to its loss from both\nspeaker populations. This supplies predictions that can be tested against\nempirical data. Here, the model is evaluated with the help of two case studies,\nmorphological levelling in Afrikaans and the erosion of null subjects in\nAfro-Peruvian Spanish; the model is found to be broadly in agreement with the\nhistorical development in both cases.",

Recent deep learning approaches focus on mining subtle rPPG clues\nusing convolutional neural networks with limited spatio-temporal receptive\nfields, which neglect the long-range spatio-temporal perception and interaction\nfor rPPG modeling. In this paper, we propose the PhysFormer, an end-to-end\nvideo transformer based architecture, to adaptively aggregate both local and\nglobal spatio-temporal features for rPPG representation enhancement. As key\nmodules in PhysFormer, the temporal difference transformers first enhance the\nquasi-periodic rPPG features with temporal difference guided global attention,\nand then refine the local spatio-temporal representation against interference.\nFurthermore, we also propose the label distribution learning and a curriculum\nlearning inspired dynamic constraint in frequency domain, which provide\nelaborate supervisions for PhysFormer and alleviate overfitting.

However,\nthe poor photorealism and lack of diverse sensor modalities of existing\nsimulation engines remain key hurdles towards realizing this potential. Here,\nwe present VISTA, an open source, data-driven simulator that integrates\nmultiple types of sensors for autonomous vehicles. Using high fidelity,\nreal-world datasets, VISTA represents and simulates RGB cameras, 3D LiDAR, and\nevent-based cameras, enabling the rapid generation of novel viewpoints in\nsimulation and thereby enriching the data available for policy learning with\ncorner cases that are difficult to capture in the physical world. Using VISTA,\nwe demonstrate the ability to train and test perception-to-control policies\nacross each of the sensor types and showcase the power of this approach via\ndeployment on a full scale autonomous vehicle. The policies learned in VISTA\nexhibit sim-to-real transfer without modification and greater robustness than\nthose trained exclusively on real-world data.",

    "title": "Self-Supervised Pre-Training for Transformer-Based Person  Re-Identification",
    "abstract": "Transformer-based supervised pre-training achieves great performance in\nperson re-identification (ReID). However, due to the domain gap between\nImageNet and ReID datasets, it usually needs a larger pre-training dataset\n(e.g. ImageNet-21K) to boost the performance because of the strong data fitting\nability of the transformer. To address this challenge, this work targets to\nmitigate the gap between the pre-training and ReID datasets from the\nperspective of data and model structure, respectively. We first investigate\nself-supervised learning (SSL) methods with Vision Transformer (ViT) pretrained\non unlabelled person images (the LUPerson dataset), and empirically find it\nsignificantly surpasses ImageNet supervised pre-training models on ReID tasks.\nTo further reduce the domain gap and accelerate the pre-training, the\nCatastrophic Forgetting Score (CFS) is proposed to evaluate the gap between\npre-training and fine-tuning data. Based on CFS, a subset is selected via\nsampling relevant data close to the down-stream ReID data and filtering\nirrelevant data from the pre-training dataset. For the model structure, a\nReID-specific module named IBN-based convolution stem (ICS) is proposed to\nbridge the domain gap by learning more invariant features. Extensive\nexperiments have been conducted to fine-tune the pre-training models under\nsupervised learning, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), and unsupervised\nlearning (USL) settings. We successfully downscale the LUPerson dataset to 50%\nwith no performance degradation. Finally, we achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on Market-1501 and MSMT17. For example, our ViT-S/16 achieves\n91.3%/89.9%/89.6% mAP accuracy on Market1501 for supervised/UDA/USL ReID. Codes\nand models will be released to https://github.com/michuanhaohao/TransReID-SSL.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose UNICORN, a vision-language (VL) model that unifies\ntext generation and bounding box prediction into a single architecture.\nSpecifically, we quantize each box into four discrete box tokens and serialize\nthem as a sequence, which can be integrated with text tokens. We formulate all\nVL problems as a generation task, where the target sequence consists of the\nintegrated text and box tokens. We then train a transformer encoder-decoder to\npredict the target in an auto-regressive manner. With such a unified framework\nand input-output format, UNICORN achieves comparable performance to\ntask-specific state of the art on 7 VL benchmarks, covering the visual\ngrounding, grounded captioning, visual question answering, and image captioning\ntasks. When trained with multi-task finetuning, UNICORN can approach different\nVL tasks with a single set of parameters, thus crossing downstream task\nboundary. We show that having a single model not only saves parameters, but\nalso further boosts the model performance on certain tasks. Finally, UNICORN\nshows the capability of generalizing to new tasks such as ImageNet object\nlocalization.",

We\ndemonstrate the feasibility of implementation of such strategies in the current\nZwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public alert data stream. We compare the\nperformance of two AL strategies: uncertainty sampling and random sampling. Our\npipeline consists of 3 stages: feature extraction, classification and learning\nstrategy. Starting from an initial sample of 10 alerts (5 SN Ia and 5 non-Ia),\nwe let the algorithm identify which alert should be added to the training\nsample. The system is allowed to evolve through 300 iterations. Our data set\nconsists of 23 840 alerts from the ZTF with confirmed classification via\ncross-match with SIMBAD database and the Transient name server (TNS), 1 600 of\nwhich were SNe Ia (1 021 unique objects). The data configuration, after the\nlearning cycle was completed, consists of 310 alerts for training and 23 530\nfor testing. Averaging over 100 realizations, the classifier achieved 89%\npurity and 54% efficiency. From 01/November/2020 to 31/October/2021 Fink has\napplied its early supernova Ia module to the ZTF stream and communicated\npromising SN Ia candidates to the TNS. From the 535 spectroscopically\nclassified Fink candidates, 459 (86%) were proven to be SNe Ia. Our results\nconfirm the effectiveness of active learning strategies for guiding the\nconstruction of optimal training samples for astronomical classifiers. It\ndemonstrates in real data that the performance of learning algorithms can be\nhighly improved without the need of extra computational resources or\noverwhelmingly large training samples.

    "abstract": "In neuromorphic computing, artificial synapses provide a multi-weight\nconductance state that is set based on inputs from neurons, analogous to the\nbrain. Additional properties of the synapse beyond multiple weights can be\nneeded, and can depend on the application, requiring the need for generating\ndifferent synapse behaviors from the same materials. Here, we measure\nartificial synapses based on magnetic materials that use a magnetic tunnel\njunction and a magnetic domain wall. By fabricating lithographic notches in a\ndomain wall track underneath a single magnetic tunnel junction, we achieve 4-5\nstable resistance states that can be repeatably controlled electrically using\nspin orbit torque. We analyze the effect of geometry on the synapse behavior,\nshowing that a trapezoidal device has asymmetric weight updates with high\ncontrollability, while a straight device has higher stochasticity, but with\nstable resistance levels. The device data is input into neuromorphic computing\nsimulators to show the usefulness of application-specific synaptic functions.\nImplementing an artificial neural network applied on streamed Fashion-MNIST\ndata, we show that the trapezoidal magnetic synapse can be used as a\nmetaplastic function for efficient online learning. Implementing a\nconvolutional neural network for CIFAR-100 image recognition, we show that the\nstraight magnetic synapse achieves near-ideal inference accuracy, due to the\nstability of its resistance levels.

Accurate and efficient segmentation of pneumonia lesions in\nCT scans is vital for treatment decision-making. We proposed a novel\nunsupervised approach using cycle consistent generative adversarial network\n(cycle-GAN) which automates and accelerates the process of lesion delineation.\nThe workflow includes lung volume segmentation, \"synthetic\" healthy lung\ngeneration, infected and healthy image subtraction, and binary lesion mask\ncreation. The lung volume volume was firstly delineated using a pre-trained\nU-net and worked as the input for the later network. The cycle-GAN was\ndeveloped to generate synthetic \"healthy\" lung CT images from infected lung\nimages. After that, the pneumonia lesions are extracted by subtracting the\nsynthetic \"healthy\" lung CT images from the \"infected\" lung CT images. A median\nfilter and K-means clustering were then applied to contour the lesions. The\nauto segmentation approach was validated on two public datasets (Coronacases\nand Radiopedia). The Dice coefficients reached 0.748 and 0.730, respectively,\nfor the Coronacases and Radiopedia datasets. Meanwhile, the precision and\nsensitivity for lesion segmentationdetection are 0.813 and 0.735 for the\nCoronacases dataset, and 0.773 and 0.726 for the Radiopedia dataset. The\nperformance is comparable to existing supervised segmentation networks and\noutperforms previous unsupervised ones. The proposed unsupervised segmentation\nmethod achieved high accuracy and efficiency in automatic COVID-19 lesion\ndelineation. The segmentation result can serve as a baseline for further manual\nmodification and a quality assurance tool for lesion diagnosis. Furthermore,\ndue to its unsupervised nature, the result is not influenced by physicians'\nexperience which otherwise is crucial for supervised methods.",

The mathematical description is given by a Partial\nDifferential Equation (PDE) of the temperature distribution defined on a\nspatial interval with a moving boundary, where the boundary represents the\nliquid-solid interface and its dynamics are governed by an Ordinary\nDifferential Equation (ODE). The PDE-ODE coupling at the boundary is nonlinear\nand creates a significant challenge for state estimation with provable\nconvergence and robustness. This tutorial article presents a state estimation\nmethod based on PDE backstepping for the Stefan system, using measurements only\nat the moving boundary. PDE backstepping observer design generates an observer\ngain by employing a Volterra transformation of the observer error state into a\ndesirable target system, solving a Goursat-form PDE for the transformation's\nkernel, and performing a Lyapunov analysis of the target observer error system.\nThe observer is applied to models of problems motivated by climate change and\nthe need for renewable energy storage: a model of polar ice dynamics and a\nmodel of charging and discharging in lithium-ion batteries. The numerical\nresults for polar ice demonstrate a robust performance of the designed\nestimator with respect to the unmodeled salinity effect in sea ice. The results\nfor an electrochemical PDE model of a lithium-ion battery with a phase\ntransition material show the elimination of more than 15 \\% error in\nState-of-Charge estimate within 5 minutes even in the presence of sensor noise.",

This work is an extension of our original\nMILP framework (DOI:10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3064928) and inherits many of its\nconstructions and strengths, including the base MILP formulation for DSN\nscheduling. To provide more feasible schedules with respect to the DSN\nrequirements, $\\Delta$-MILP incorporates new sets of constraints including 1)\nsplitting larger tracks into shorter segments and 2) preventing overlapping\nbetween tracks on different antennas. Additionally, $\\Delta$-MILP leverages a\nheuristic to balance mission satisfaction and allows to prioritize certain\nmissions in special scenarios including emergencies and landings. Numerical\nvalidations demonstrate that $\\Delta$-MILP now satisfies 100% of the requested\nconstraints and provides fair schedules amongst missions with respect to the\nstate-of-the-art for the most oversubscribed weeks of the years 2016 and 2018.",

    "abstract": "In this work we use variational inference to quantify the degree of epistemic\nuncertainty in model predictions of radio galaxy classification and show that\nthe level of model posterior variance for individual test samples is correlated\nwith human uncertainty when labelling radio galaxies. We explore the model\nperformance and uncertainty calibration for a variety of different weight\npriors and suggest that a sparse prior produces more well-calibrated\nuncertainty estimates. Using the posterior distributions for individual\nweights, we show that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranking allows pruning of the\nfully-connected layers to the level of 30\\% without significant loss of\nperformance, and that this pruning increases the predictive uncertainty in the\nmodel. Finally we show that, like other work in this field, we experience a\ncold posterior effect. We examine whether adapting the cost function in our\nmodel to accommodate model misspecification can compensate for this effect, but\nfind that it does not make a significant difference. We also examine the effect\nof principled data augmentation and find that it improves upon the baseline but\ndoes not compensate for the observed effect fully. We interpret this as the\ncold posterior effect being due to the overly effective curation of our\ntraining sample leading to likelihood misspecification, and raise this as a\npotential issue for Bayesian deep learning approaches to radio galaxy\nclassification in future.",

Yet the lack of imaging datasets which\ncapture clinical context, inclusive of demographics and longitudinal medical\nhistory, has left multimodal medical imaging underexplored. To better assess\nthese challenges, we present RadFusion, a multimodal, benchmark dataset of 1794\npatients with corresponding EHR data and high-resolution computed tomography\n(CT) scans labeled for pulmonary embolism. We evaluate several representative\nmultimodal fusion models and benchmark their fairness properties across\nprotected subgroups, e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, age.

    "abstract": "Asteroid exploration has been attracting more attention in recent years.\nNevertheless, we have just visited tens of asteroids while we have discovered\nmore than one million bodies. As our current observation and knowledge should\nbe biased, it is essential to explore multiple asteroids directly to better\nunderstand the remains of planetary building materials. One of the mission\ndesign solutions is utilizing asteroid flyby cycler trajectories with multiple\nEarth gravity assists. An asteroid flyby cycler trajectory design problem is a\nsubclass of global trajectory optimization problems with multiple flybys,\ninvolving a trajectory optimization problem for a given flyby sequence and a\ncombinatorial optimization problem to decide the sequence of the flybys. As the\nnumber of flyby bodies grows, the computation time of this optimization problem\nexpands maliciously. This paper presents a new method to design asteroid flyby\ncycler trajectories utilizing a surrogate model constructed by deep neural\nnetworks approximating trajectory optimization results. Since one of the\nbottlenecks of machine learning approaches is to generate massive trajectory\ndatabases, we propose an efficient database generation strategy by introducing\npseudo-asteroids satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The numerical\nresult applied to JAXA's DESTINY+ mission shows that the proposed method can\nsignificantly reduce the computational time for searching asteroid flyby\nsequences.",

    "abstract": "Longitudinal image registration is challenging and has not yet benefited from\nmajor performance improvements thanks to deep-learning. Inspired by Deep Image\nPrior, this paper introduces a different use of deep architectures as\nregularizers to tackle the image registration question. We propose a\nsubject-specific deformable registration method called MIRRBA, relying on a\ndeep pyramidal architecture to be the prior parametric model constraining the\ndeformation field. Diverging from the supervised learning paradigm, MIRRBA does\nnot require a learning database, but only the pair of images to be registered\nto optimize the network's parameters and provide a deformation field. We\ndemonstrate the regularizing power of deep architectures and present new\nelements to understand the role of the architecture in deep learning methods\nfor registration. Hence, to study the impact of the network parameters, we ran\nour method with different architectural configurations on a private dataset of\n110 metastatic breast cancer full-body PET images with manual segmentations of\nthe brain, bladder and metastatic lesions. We compared it against conventional\niterative registration approaches and supervised deep learning-based models.\nGlobal and local registration accuracies were evaluated using the detection\nrate and the Dice score respectively, while registration realism was evaluated\nusing the Jacobian's determinant. Moreover, we computed the ability of the\ndifferent methods to shrink vanishing lesions with the disappearing rate.\nMIRRBA significantly improves the organ and lesion Dice scores of supervised\nmodels. Regarding the disappearing rate, MIRRBA more than doubles the best\nperforming conventional approach SyNCC score. Our work therefore proposes an\nalternative way to bridge the performance gap between conventional and deep\nlearning-based methods and demonstrates the regularizing power of deep\narchitectures.",

For a\nspanning tree $T$ defined on the vertex set $\\{1,\\dots ,d\\}$, the tree density\n$f_{T}$ is a product of bivariate conditional densities. The optimal spanning\ntree $T^*$ is the spanning tree $T$, for which the Kullback-Leibler divergence\nof $f$ and $f_{T}$ is the smallest. From i.i.d. data we identify the optimal\ntree $T^*$ and computationally efficiently construct a tree density estimate\n$f_n$ such that, without any regularity conditions on the density $f$, one has\nthat $\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\int |f_n(\\boldsymbol x)-f_{T^*}(\\boldsymbol\nx)|d\\boldsymbol x=0$ a.s. For Lipschitz continuous $f$ with bounded support,\n$\\mathbb E\\{ \\int |f_n(\\boldsymbol x)-f_{T^*}(\\boldsymbol x)|d\\boldsymbol\nx\\}=O(n^{-1/4})$.",

    "title": "Degree-preserving graph dynamics -- a versatile process to construct  random networks",
    "abstract": "Real-world networks evolve over time via additions or removals of nodes and\nedges. In current network evolution models, node degree varies or grows\narbitrarily. A recently introduced degree-preserving network growth (DPG)\nfamily of models preserves node degree, resulting in structures significantly\ndifferent from and more diverse than previous models (Nature Physics 2021,\nDOI:10.1038/s41567-021-01417-7). Here we present a rigorous mathematical theory\nunderlying the DPG family of network growth models. We prove that the general\nproblem of deciding whether a simple graph can be obtained via the DPG process\nfrom a small \"kernel\" graph (DPG feasibility) is NP-complete, in contrast with\nthe surprising numerical observation that most real-world networks are actually\neasily constructible by this process; a dichotomy that still needs to be\nunderstood. We demonstrate how some of the well-known network models can be\nconstructed via the DPG process, using proper parametrization.",

    "title": "Physics Informed Neural Networks for Control Oriented Thermal Modeling  of Buildings",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a data-driven modeling approach for developing\ncontrol-oriented thermal models of buildings. These models are developed with\nthe objective of reducing energy consumption costs while controlling the indoor\ntemperature of the building within required comfort limits. To combine the\ninterpretability of white/gray box physics models and the expressive power of\nneural networks, we propose a physics informed neural network approach for this\nmodeling task. Along with measured data and building parameters, we encode the\nneural networks with the underlying physics that governs the thermal behavior\nof these buildings. Thus, realizing a model that is guided by physics, aids in\nmodeling the temporal evolution of room temperature and power consumption as\nwell as the hidden state, i.e., the temperature of building thermal mass for\nsubsequent time steps. The main research contributions of this work are: (1) we\npropose two variants of physics informed neural network architectures for the\ntask of control-oriented thermal modeling of buildings, (2) we show that\ntraining these architectures is data-efficient, requiring less training data\ncompared to conventional, non-physics informed neural networks, and (3) we show\nthat these architectures achieve more accurate predictions than conventional\nneural networks for longer prediction horizons. We test the prediction\nperformance of the proposed architectures using simulated and real-word data to\ndemonstrate (2) and (3) and show that the proposed physics informed neural\nnetwork architectures can be used for this control-oriented modeling problem.",
