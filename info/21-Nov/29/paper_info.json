    "abstract": "While captioning models have obtained compelling results in describing\nnatural images, they still do not cover the entire long-tail distribution of\nreal-world concepts. In this paper, we address the task of generating\nhuman-like descriptions with in-the-wild concepts by training on web-scale\nautomatically collected datasets. To this end, we propose a model which can\nexploit noisy image-caption pairs while maintaining the descriptive style of\ntraditional human-annotated datasets like COCO. Our model separates content\nfrom style through the usage of keywords and stylistic tokens, employing a\nsingle objective of prompt language modeling and being simpler than other\nrecent proposals. Experimentally, our model consistently outperforms existing\nmethods in terms of caption quality and capability of describing long-tail\nconcepts, also in zero-shot settings. According to the CIDEr metric, we obtain\na new state of the art on both COCO and nocaps when using external data.",

While\nrecent progress in implicit function (e.g., DeepSDF) has shown encouraging\nresults on high-quality 3D shape reconstruction, it is still very challenging\nto generalize to cluttered and partially observable LiDAR data. In this paper,\nwe propose to leverage the continuity in video data. We introduce a novel and\nunified framework which utilizes a DeepSDF model to simultaneously track and\nreconstruct 3D objects in the wild.

Rendering these\nprimitives gives results in a high-dimensional latent image, which is then\ntransformed into an RGB image by a decoder network. The formulation gives rise\nto a fully differentiable framework that can be trained end-to-end.

This work proposes a\nmethod for removing the background using semantic segmentation of ID Cards. In\nthe end, images captured in the wild from the real operation, using a manually\nlabelled dataset consisting of 45,007 images, with five types of ID Cards from\nthree countries (Chile, Argentina and Mexico), including typical presentation\nattack scenarios, were used. This method can help to improve the following\nstages in a regular identity verification or document tampering detection\nsystem. Two Deep Learning approaches were explored, based on MobileUNet and\nDenseNet10. The best results were obtained using MobileUNet, with 6.5 million\nparameters. A Chilean ID Card's mean Intersection Over Union (IoU) was 0.9926\non a private test dataset of 4,988 images. The best results for the fused\nmulti-country dataset of ID Card images from Chile, Argentina and Mexico\nreached an IoU of 0.9911.

A typical VRE is\noften implemented as an integrated environment, which includes a catalog of\nresearch assets, a workflow management system, a data management framework, and\ntools for enabling collaboration among users. Notebook environments, such as\nJupyter, allow researchers to rapidly prototype scientific code and share their\nexperiments as online accessible notebooks. Jupyter can support several popular\nlanguages that are used by data scientists, such as Python, R, and Julia.\nHowever, such notebook environments do not have seamless support for running\nheavy computations on remote infrastructure or finding and accessing software\ncode inside notebooks. This paper investigates the gap between a notebook\nenvironment and a VRE and proposes an embedded VRE solution for the Jupyter\nenvironment called Notebook-as-a-VRE (NaaVRE). The NaaVRE solution provides\nfunctional components via a component marketplace and allows users to create a\ncustomized VRE on top of the Jupyter environment. From the VRE, a user can\nsearch research assets (data, software, and algorithms), compose workflows,\nmanage the lifecycle of an experiment, and share the results among users in the\ncommunity.

    "abstract": "Given a real-valued hypothesis class $\\mathcal{H}$, we investigate under what\nconditions there is a differentially private algorithm which learns an optimal\nhypothesis from $\\mathcal{H}$ given i.i.d. data. Inspired by recent results for\nthe related setting of binary classification (Alon et al., 2019; Bun et al.,\n2020), where it was shown that online learnability of a binary class is\nnecessary and sufficient for its private learnability, Jung et al. (2020)\nshowed that in the setting of regression, online learnability of $\\mathcal{H}$\nis necessary for private learnability. Here online learnability of\n$\\mathcal{H}$ is characterized by the finiteness of its $\\eta$-sequential fat\nshattering dimension, ${\\rm sfat}_\\eta(\\mathcal{H})$, for all $\\eta > 0$. In\nterms of sufficient conditions for private learnability, Jung et al. (2020)\nshowed that $\\mathcal{H}$ is privately learnable if $\\lim_{\\eta \\downarrow 0}\n{\\rm sfat}_\\eta(\\mathcal{H})$ is finite, which is a fairly restrictive\ncondition. We show that under the relaxed condition $\\lim \\inf_{\\eta \\downarrow\n0} \\eta \\cdot {\\rm sfat}_\\eta(\\mathcal{H}) = 0$, $\\mathcal{H}$ is privately\nlearnable, establishing the first nonparametric private learnability guarantee\nfor classes $\\mathcal{H}$ with ${\\rm sfat}_\\eta(\\mathcal{H})$ diverging as\n$\\eta \\downarrow 0$. Our techniques involve a novel filtering procedure to\noutput stable hypotheses for nonparametric function classes.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in algorithm-hardware co-design for deep neural networks\n(DNNs) have demonstrated their potential in automatically designing neural\narchitectures and hardware designs. Nevertheless, it is still a challenging\noptimization problem due to the expensive training cost and the time-consuming\nhardware implementation, which makes the exploration on the vast design space\nof neural architecture and hardware design intractable. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed approach is capable of locating designs on the\nPareto frontier. This capability is enabled by a novel three-phase co-design\nframework, with the following new features: (a) decoupling DNN training from\nthe design space exploration of hardware architecture and neural architecture,\n(b) providing a hardware-friendly neural architecture space by considering\nhardware characteristics in constructing the search cells, (c) adopting\nGaussian process to predict accuracy, latency and power consumption to avoid\ntime-consuming synthesis and place-and-route processes. In comparison with the\nmanually-designed ResNet101, InceptionV2 and MobileNetV2, we can achieve up to\n5% higher accuracy with up to 3x speed up on the ImageNet dataset.

    "abstract": "Imbalanced Learning (IL) is an important problem that widely exists in data\nmining applications. Typical IL methods utilize intuitive class-wise resampling\nor reweighting to directly balance the training set. However, some recent\nresearch efforts in specific domains show that class-imbalanced learning can be\nachieved without class-wise manipulation. This prompts us to think about the\nrelationship between the two different IL strategies and the nature of the\nclass imbalance. Fundamentally, they correspond to two essential imbalances\nthat exist in IL: the difference in quantity between examples from different\nclasses as well as between easy and hard examples within a single class, i.e.,\ninter-class and intra-class imbalance. Existing works fail to explicitly take\nboth imbalances into account and thus suffer from suboptimal performance. In\nlight of this, we present Duple-Balanced Ensemble, namely DUBE , a versatile\nensemble learning framework. Unlike prevailing methods, DUBE directly performs\ninter-class and intra-class balancing without relying on heavy distance-based\ncomputation, which allows it to achieve competitive performance while being\ncomputationally efficient. We also present a detailed discussion and analysis\nabout the pros and cons of different inter/intra-class balancing strategies\nbased on DUBE . Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method. Code and examples are available at\nhttps://github.com/ICDE2022Sub/duplebalance.",

    "abstract": "Traditional 2D animation is labor-intensive, often requiring animators to\nmanually draw twelve illustrations per second of movement. While automatic\nframe interpolation may ease this burden, the artistic effects inherent to 2D\nanimation make video synthesis particularly challenging compared to in the\nphotorealistic domain. Lower framerates result in larger displacements and\nocclusions, discrete perceptual elements (e.g. lines and solid-color regions)\npose difficulties for texture-oriented convolutional networks, and exaggerated\nnonlinear movements hinder training data collection. Previous work tried\naddressing these issues, but used unscalable methods and focused on\npixel-perfect performance. In contrast, we build a scalable system more\nappropriately centered on perceptual quality for this artistic domain. Firstly,\nwe propose a lightweight architecture with a simple yet effective\nocclusion-inpainting technique to improve convergence on perceptual metrics\nwith fewer trainable parameters. Secondly, we design a novel auxiliary module\nthat leverages the Euclidean distance transform to improve the preservation of\nkey line and region structures. Thirdly, we automatically double the existing\nmanually-collected dataset for this task by quantitatively filtering out\nmovement nonlinearities, allowing us to improve model generalization. Finally,\nwe establish LPIPS and chamfer distance as strongly preferable to PSNR and SSIM\nthrough a user study, validating our system's emphasis on perceptual quality in\nthe 2D animation domain.",

    "abstract": "The locomotion and mechanical efficiency of micro organisms, specifically\nmicro-swimmers, have drawn interest in the fields of biology and fluid\ndynamics. A challenge in designing flagellated micro- and macro-scale robots is\nthe geometrically nonlinear deformation of slender structures (e.g. rod-like\nflagella) ensuing from the interplay of elasticity and hydrodynamics. Certain\ntypes of bacteria such as Escherichia coli propel themselves by rotating\nmultiple filamentary structures in low Reynolds flow. This multi-flagellated\npropulsive mechanism is qualitatively different from the single-flagellated\nmechanism exhibited by some other types of bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae.\nThe differences include the flagella forming a bundle to increase directional\nstability for cell motility, offering redundancy for a cell to move, and\noffering the ability of flagella to be the delivery material itself. Above all,\nmulti-flagellated biological system can inspire novel soft robots for\napplication in drug transportation and delivery within the human body. We\npresent a macroscopic soft robotic hardware platform and a computational\nframework for a physically plausible simulation model of the multi-flagellated\nrobot. The fluid-structure interaction simulation couples the Discrete Elastic\nRods algorithm with the method of Regularized Stokeslet Segments. Contact\nbetween two flagella is handled by a penalty-based method due to Spillmann and\nTeschner. We present comparison between our experimental and simulation results\nand verify that the simulation tool can capture the essential physics of this\nproblem.

    "abstract": "Identifying outlier documents, whose content is different from the majority\nof the documents in a corpus, has played an important role to manage a large\ntext collection. However, due to the absence of explicit information about the\ninlier (or target) distribution, existing unsupervised outlier detectors are\nlikely to make unreliable results depending on the density or diversity of the\noutliers in the corpus. To address this challenge, we introduce a new task\nreferred to as out-of-category detection, which aims to distinguish the\ndocuments according to their semantic relevance to the inlier (or target)\ncategories by using the category names as weak supervision. In practice, this\ntask can be widely applicable in that it can flexibly designate the scope of\ntarget categories according to users' interests while requiring only the\ntarget-category names as minimum guidance. In this paper, we present an\nout-of-category detection framework, which effectively measures how confidently\neach document belongs to one of the target categories based on its\ncategory-specific relevance score. Our framework adopts a two-step approach;\n(i) it first generates the pseudo-category label of all unlabeled documents by\nexploiting the word-document similarity encoded in a text embedding space, then\n(ii) it trains a neural classifier by using the pseudo-labels in order to\ncompute the confidence from its target-category prediction. The experiments on\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves the best detection\nperformance among all baseline methods in various scenarios specifying\ndifferent target categories.",

We develop a comprehensive theory of tiny\npointers, and give optimal constructions for both fixed-size tiny pointers\n(i.e., settings in which all of the tiny pointers must be the same size) and\nvariable-size tiny pointers (i.e., settings in which the average tiny-pointer\nsize must be small, but some tiny pointers can be larger).

Ecologists use camera traps to remotely survey for the presence\nof specific animal species. Previous studies have shown that deep learning\nmodels can be trained to automatically detect and classify animals within\ncamera trap imagery with high levels of confidence. However, the ability to\ntrain these models is reliant upon having enough high-quality training data.\nWhat happens when the animal is rare or the data sets are non-existent? This\nresearch proposes an approach of using images of rare animals in captivity\n(focusing on the Scottish wildcat) to generate the training dataset. We explore\nthe challenges associated with generalising a model trained on captivity data\nwhen applied to data collected in the wild. The research is contextualised by\nthe needs of ecologists in planning/engineering. Following precedents from\nother research, this project establishes an ensemble for object detection,\nimage segmentation and image classification models which are then tested using\ndifferent image manipulation and class structuring techniques to encourage\nmodel generalisation. The research concludes, in the context of Scottish\nwildcat, that models trained on captivity imagery cannot be generalised to wild\ncamera trap imagery using existing techniques. However, final model\nperformances based on a two-class model Wildcat vs Not Wildcat achieved an\noverall accuracy score of 81.6% and Wildcat accuracy score of 54.8% on a test\nset in which only 1% of images contained a wildcat. This suggests using\ncaptivity images is feasible with further research. This is the first research\nwhich attempts to generate a training set based on captivity data and the first\nto explore the development of such models in the context of ecologists in\nplanning/engineering.",

Hence, this approach simplifies signaling design for MIMO systems\nand can reduce the hardware complexity by having one set of parameters to\noptimize. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art solutions for both problems. It increases\ntransmission rates for multicasting and achieves higher rate-energy regions in\nthe SWIPT case. In both cases, the improvement is significant (20%-30%) in\npractically important settings where the users have one or two antennas.\nFurthermore, the new precoders are less time-consuming than the existing\nsolutions.",

We\naddress the problem of how to select additional features to most greatly\nimprove AUC for the disadvantaged group.

Using this connection, we develop a novel\napproach, fairAUC, based on feature augmentation (adding features) to mitigate\nbias between identifiable groups.

Traditionally, satellite networks are modeled by\nplacing satellites on a grid of multiple circular orbit geometries. Such a\nnetwork model, however, requires intricate system-level simulations to evaluate\ncoverage performance, and analytical understanding of the satellite network is\nlimited. Continuing the success of stochastic geometry in a tractable analysis\nfor terrestrial networks, in this paper, we develop novel models that are\ntractable for the coverage analysis of satellite networks using stochastic\ngeometry. By modeling the locations of satellites and users using Poisson point\nprocesses on the surfaces of concentric spheres, we characterize analytical\nexpressions for the coverage probability of a typical downlink user as a\nfunction of relevant parameters, including path-loss exponent, satellite\nheight, density, and Nakagami fading parameter. Then, we also derive a tight\nlower bound of the coverage probability in closed-form expression while keeping\nfull generality. Leveraging the derived expression, we identify the optimal\ndensity of satellites in terms of the height and the path-loss exponent. Our\nkey finding is that the optimal average number of satellites decreases\nlogarithmically with the network height to maximize the coverage performance.\nSimulation results verify the exactness of the derived expressions.",

Moreover, our framework design applies a novel\napproach, to adaptively fuse different models and TFRs symbiotically. Hence,\nthe overall performance can be significantly improved. We quantitatively\nexamine the benefits of our framework by using Capsule Neural Networks, a\nstate-of-the-art approach for PSED. The experimental results show that our\nmethod achieves a reduction of 7\\% in error rate compared with the\nstate-of-the-art solutions on the TUT-SED 2016 dataset.",

    "abstract": "This study debuts a new spline dimensional decomposition (SDD) for\nuncertainty quantification analysis of high-dimensional functions, including\nthose endowed with high nonlinearity and nonsmoothness, if they exist, in a\nproficient manner. The decomposition creates an hierarchical expansion for an\noutput random variable of interest with respect to measure-consistent\northonormalized basis splines (B-splines) in independent input random\nvariables. A dimensionwise decomposition of a spline space into orthogonal\nsubspaces, each spanned by a reduced set of such orthonormal splines, results\nin SDD. Exploiting the modulus of smoothness, the SDD approximation is shown to\nconverge in mean-square to the correct limit. The computational complexity of\nthe SDD method is polynomial, as opposed to exponential, thus alleviating the\ncurse of dimensionality to the extent possible. Analytical formulae are\nproposed to calculate the second-moment properties of a truncated SDD\napproximation for a general output random variable in terms of the expansion\ncoefficients involved. Numerical results indicate that a low-order SDD\napproximation of nonsmooth functions calculates the probabilistic\ncharacteristics of an output variable with an accuracy matching or surpassing\nthose obtained by high-order approximations from several existing methods.\nFinally, a 34-dimensional random eigenvalue analysis demonstrates the utility\nof SDD in solving practical problems.",

A particularly interesting\ndirection is to compress the data while keeping the \"structural information\"\nonly and ignoring the concrete labelings. Under this direction, Choi and\nSzpankowski introduced the structures (unlabeled graphs) which allowed them to\ncompute the structural entropy of the Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi random graph model.\nMoreover, they also provided an asymptotically optimal compression algorithm\nthat (asymptotically) achieves this entropy limit and runs in expectation in\nlinear time.\nIn this paper, we consider the Stochastic Block Models with an arbitrary\nnumber of parts. Indeed, we define a partitioned structural entropy for\nStochastic Block Models, which generalizes the structural entropy for unlabeled\ngraphs and encodes the partition information as well. We then compute the\npartitioned structural entropy of the Stochastic Block Models, and provide a\ncompression scheme that asymptotically achieves this entropy limit.",

    "abstract": "We study the automatic generation of navigation instructions from 360-degree\nimages captured on indoor routes. Existing generators suffer from poor visual\ngrounding, causing them to rely on language priors and hallucinate objects. Our\nMARKY-MT5 system addresses this by focusing on visual landmarks; it comprises a\nfirst stage landmark detector and a second stage generator -- a multimodal,\nmultilingual, multitask encoder-decoder. To train it, we bootstrap grounded\nlandmark annotations on top of the Room-across-Room (RxR) dataset. Using text\nparsers, weak supervision from RxR's pose traces, and a multilingual image-text\nencoder trained on 1.8b images, we identify 1.1m English, Hindi and Telugu\nlandmark descriptions and ground them to specific regions in panoramas. On\nRoom-to-Room, human wayfinders obtain success rates (SR) of 71% following\nMARKY-MT5's instructions, just shy of their 75% SR following human instructions\n-- and well above SRs with other generators. Evaluations on RxR's longer,\ndiverse paths obtain 61-64% SRs on three languages.

    "abstract": "In this work we investigate how to achieve equivariance to input\ntransformations in deep networks, purely from data, without being given a model\nof those transformations. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for example,\nare equivariant to image translation, a transformation that can be easily\nmodelled (by shifting the pixels vertically or horizontally). Other\ntransformations, such as out-of-plane rotations, do not admit a simple analytic\nmodel. We propose an auto-encoder architecture whose embedding obeys an\narbitrary set of equivariance relations simultaneously, such as translation,\nrotation, colour changes, and many others. This means that it can take an input\nimage, and produce versions transformed by a given amount that were not\nobserved before (e.g. a different point of view of the same object, or a colour\nvariation). Despite extending to many (even non-geometric) transformations, our\nmodel reduces exactly to a CNN in the special case of translation-equivariance.\nEquivariances are important for the interpretability and robustness of deep\nnetworks, and we demonstrate results of successful re-rendering of transformed\nversions of input images on several synthetic and real datasets, as well as\nresults on object pose estimation.",

AL is especially impactful in industrial\nscale settings where data labeling costs are high and practitioners use every\ntool at their disposal to improve model performance. The recent success of\nself-supervised pretraining (SSP) highlights the importance of harnessing\nabundant unlabeled data to boost model performance.

Methods for\nestimating the mask-wearing ratio on the basis of image analysis have been\nreported. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on both\nmethodologies and datasets. Most recent reports straightforwardly propose\nestimating the ratio by applying conventional object detection and\nclassification methods. It is feasible to use regression-based approaches to\nestimate the number of people wearing masks, especially for congested scenes\nwith tiny and occluded faces, but this has not been well studied. A large-scale\nand well-annotated dataset is still in demand. In this paper, we present two\nmethods for ratio estimation that leverage either a detection-based or\nregression-based approach. For the detection-based approach, we improved the\nstate-of-the-art face detector, RetinaFace, used to estimate the ratio. For the\nregression-based approach, we fine-tuned the baseline network, CSRNet, used to\nestimate the density maps for masked and unmasked faces. We also present the\nfirst large-scale dataset, the ``NFM dataset,'' which contains 581,108 face\nannotations extracted from 18,088 video frames in 17 street-view videos.\nExperiments demonstrated that the RetinaFace-based method has higher accuracy\nunder various situations and that the CSRNet-based method has a shorter\noperation time thanks to its compactness.",

For bottom-up multi-person pose estimation\nmodels, they need to detect keypoints and learn associative information between\nkeypoints. We argue that these problems can be entirely solved by Transformer.\nSpecifically, the self-attention in Transformer measures dependencies between\nany pair of locations, which can provide association information for keypoints\ngrouping. However, the naive attention patterns are still not subjectively\ncontrolled, so there is no guarantee that the keypoints will always attend to\nthe instances to which they belong. To address it we propose a novel approach\nof supervising self-attention for multi-person keypoint detection and instance\nassociation. By using instance masks to supervise self-attention to be\ninstance-aware, we can assign the detected keypoints to their corresponding\ninstances based on the pairwise attention scores, without using pre-defined\noffset vector fields or embedding like CNN-based bottom-up models. An\nadditional benefit of our method is that the instance segmentation results of\nany number of people can be directly obtained from the supervised attention\nmatrix, thereby simplifying the pixel assignment pipeline. The experiments on\nthe COCO multi-person keypoint detection challenge and person instance\nsegmentation task demonstrate the effectiveness and simplicity of the proposed\nmethod and show a promising way to control self-attention behavior for specific\npurposes.",

Recommending a handful of candidate papers to a manuscript before\npublication could ease the burden of the authors, and help the reviewers to\ncheck the completeness of the cited resources. Conventional approaches on\ncitation recommendation generally consider recommending one ground-truth\ncitation for a query context from an input manuscript, but lack of\nconsideration on co-citation recommendations.

Here, we propose a\nnovel scientific paper modeling for citation recommendations, namely\nMulti-Positive BERT Model for Citation Recommendation (MP-BERT4CR), complied\nwith a series of Multi-Positive Triplet objectives to recommend multiple\npositive citations for a query context. The proposed approach has the following\nadvantages: First, the proposed multi-positive objectives are effective to\nrecommend multiple positive candidates. Second, we adopt noise distributions\nwhich are built based on the historical co-citation frequencies, so that\nMP-BERT4CR is not only effective on recommending high-frequent co-citation\npairs; but also the performances on retrieving the low-frequent ones are\nsignificantly improved. Third, we propose a dynamic context sampling strategy\nwhich captures the ``macro-scoped'' citing intents from a manuscript and\nempowers the citation embeddings to be content-dependent, which allow the\nalgorithm to further improve the performances. Single and multiple positive\nrecommendation experiments testified that MP-BERT4CR delivered significant\nimprovements. In addition, MP-BERT4CR are also effective in retrieving the full\nlist of co-citations, and historically low-frequent co-citation pairs compared\nwith the prior works.",

In this paper,\nwe address the prediction accuracy problem of consistency learning methods with\nnovel extensions of the mean-teacher (MT) model, which include a new auxiliary\nteacher, and the replacement of MT's mean square error (MSE) by a stricter\nconfidence-weighted cross-entropy (Conf-CE) loss.

    "abstract": "Deep generative models are attracting great attention for molecular design\nwith desired properties. Most existing models generate molecules by\nsequentially adding atoms. This often renders generated molecules with less\ncorrelation with target properties and low synthetic accessibility. Molecular\nfragments such as functional groups are more closely related to molecular\nproperties and synthetic accessibility than atoms. Here, we propose a\nfragment-based molecular generative model which designs new molecules with\ntarget properties by sequentially adding molecular fragments to any given\nstarting molecule. A key feature of our model is a high generalization ability\nin terms of property control and fragment types. The former becomes possible by\nlearning the contribution of individual fragments to the target properties in\nan auto-regressive manner. For the latter, we used a deep neural network that\npredicts the bonding probability of two molecules from the embedding vectors of\nthe two molecules as input. The high synthetic accessibility of the generated\nmolecules is implicitly considered while preparing the fragment library with\nthe BRICS decomposition method. We show that the model can generate molecules\nwith the simultaneous control of multiple target properties at a high success\nrate. It also works equally well with unseen fragments even in the property\nrange where the training data is rare, verifying the high generalization\nability. As a practical application, we demonstrated that the model can\ngenerate potential inhibitors with high binding affinities against the 3CL\nprotease of SARS-COV-2 in terms of docking score.",

This paper assesses the load\nshedding experienced by customers under realistic scenarios in the actual power\ngrid. It also conducts a preliminary study on using energy storage and load\nrationing to mitigate rotating blackout's adverse impact on the grid. It is\nestimated that utility-scale battery storage systems with a total installed\ncapacity of 920 GWh would be required to fully offset the load shedding during\nthe Texas power outage if energy storage were the only technical option. Our\nsimulation result suggests that implementing 20 percent load rationing on the\nsystem could potentially reduce this estimated energy storage capacity by 85\npercent. This estimate is obtained using the predicted capacity and demand\nprofile from February 15 to February 18, 2021. Recognizing the fact that it\nwould be very challenging to practically deploy energy storage of this size,\napproaches to provide more granular demand reduction are studied as a means of\nleveraging the energy storage to maximize the survivability of consumers.\nPreliminary case study suggests the potential of combining load rationing and\nproper sizing of energy storage would potentially provide much reliability\nimprovement for the grid under such extreme weather conditions.",

We answer this challenge by providing an on-the-fly blurry data\naugmenter that can be run during training and test stages. To fully utilize it,\nwe incorporate an unorthodox scheme of deblurring framework that employs the\nsequence of blur-deblur-reblur-deblur steps.

The invariant\nenergy quadratization (IEQ) method has been widely used to design energy stable\nnumerical schemes for phase-field or gradient flow models. Although there are\nmany merits of the IEQ method, one major disadvantage is that the IEQ method\nusually respects a modified energy law, where the modified energy is expressed\nin the auxiliary variables. Still, the dissipation laws in terms of the\noriginal energy are not guaranteed. Using the widely-used Cahn-Hilliard\nequation as an example, we demonstrate that the Runge-Kutta IEQ method indeed\ncan preserve the original energy dissipation laws for certain situations up to\narbitrary high-order accuracy.

The rainy scenarios\ncan be categorized into two classes: moderate rain and heavy rain scenes.\nModerate rain scene mainly consists of rain streaks while heavy rain scene\ncontains both rain streaks and the veiling effect (similar to haze). Although\nexisting methods have achieved excellent performance on these two cases\nindividually, it still lacks a general architecture to address both heavy rain\nand moderate rain scenarios effectively. In this paper, we construct a\nhierarchical multi-direction representation network by using the contourlet\ntransform (CT) to address both moderate rain and heavy rain scenarios. The CT\ndivides the image into the multi-direction subbands (MS) and the semantic\nsubband (SS). First, the rain streak information is retrieved to the MS based\non the multi-orientation property of the CT. Second, a hierarchical\narchitecture is proposed to reconstruct the background information including\ndamaged semantic information and the veiling effect in the SS. Last, the\nmulti-level subband discriminator with the feedback error map is proposed. By\nthis module, all subbands can be well optimized.

However, with such a training paradigm,\nthe optimization target differs a lot from the ranking metrics valuing the\nrelative order of top ranked items rather than the prediction precision of each\nitem. Moreover, as the existing system tends to recommend more relevant items\nat higher positions, it is difficult for the shallow tower based methods to\nprecisely attribute the user feedback to the impact of position or relevance.\nTherefore, there exists an exciting opportunity for us to get enhanced\nperformance if we manage to solve the aforementioned issues.

This paper presents experimentation\nwith a Keras wrapped lightweight BERT model to successfully identify hate\nspeech and predict probabilistic impact score for the same to extract the\nhateful words within sentences. The dataset used for this task is the Hate\nSpeech and Offensive Content Detection (HASOC 2021) data from FIRE 2021 in\nEnglish. Our system obtained a validation accuracy of 82.60%, with a maximum\nF1-Score of 82.68%. Subsequently, our predictive cases performed significantly\nwell in generating impact scores for successful identification of the hate\ntweets as well as the hateful words from tweet pools.",

    "abstract": "Self-training has greatly facilitated domain adaptive semantic segmentation,\nwhich iteratively generates pseudo labels on the target domain and retrains the\nnetwork. However, since the realistic segmentation datasets are highly\nimbalanced, target pseudo labels are typically biased to the majority classes\nand basically noisy, leading to an error-prone and sub-optimal model. To\naddress this issue, we propose a region-based active learning approach for\nsemantic segmentation under a domain shift, aiming to automatically query a\nsmall partition of image regions to be labeled while maximizing segmentation\nperformance. Our algorithm, Active Learning via Region Impurity and Prediction\nUncertainty (AL-RIPU), introduces a novel acquisition strategy characterizing\nthe spatial adjacency of image regions along with the prediction confidence. We\nshow that the proposed region-based selection strategy makes more efficient use\nof a limited budget than image-based or point-based counterparts. Meanwhile, we\nenforce local prediction consistency between a pixel and its nearest neighbor\non a source image. Further, we develop a negative learning loss to enhance the\ndiscriminative representation learning on the target domain. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method only requires very few annotations to\nalmost reach the supervised performance and substantially outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a\nlabeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Most existing UDA\napproaches enable knowledge transfer via learning domain-invariant\nrepresentation and sharing one classifier across two domains. However, ignoring\nthe domain-specific information that are related to the task, and forcing a\nunified classifier to fit both domains will limit the feature expressiveness in\neach domain. In this paper, by observing that the Transformer architecture with\ncomparable parameters can generate more transferable representations than CNN\ncounterparts, we propose a Win-Win TRansformer framework (WinTR) that\nseparately explores the domain-specific knowledge for each domain and meanwhile\ninterchanges cross-domain knowledge. Specifically, we learn two different\nmappings using two individual classification tokens in the Transformer, and\ndesign for each one a domain-specific classifier. The cross-domain knowledge is\ntransferred via source guided label refinement and single-sided feature\nalignment with respect to source or target, which keeps the integrity of\ndomain-specific information.

However, extensive manual\nwork and domain knowledge are required to design effective architectures, and\nthe results of GNN models have high variance with different training setups,\nwhich limits the application of existing GNN models. In this paper, we present\nAutoHEnsGNN, a framework to build effective and robust models for graph tasks\nwithout any human intervention. AutoHEnsGNN won first place in the AutoGraph\nChallenge for KDD Cup 2020, and achieved the best rank score of five real-life\ndatasets in the final phase. Given a task, AutoHEnsGNN first applies a fast\nproxy evaluation to automatically select a pool of promising GNN models. Then\nit builds a hierarchical ensemble framework: 1) We propose graph self-ensemble\n(GSE), which can reduce the variance of weight initialization and efficiently\nexploit the information of local and global neighborhoods; 2) Based on GSE, a\nweighted ensemble of different types of GNN models is used to effectively learn\nmore discriminative node representations. To efficiently search the\narchitectures and ensemble weights, we propose AutoHEnsGNN$_{\\text{Gradient}}$,\nwhich treats the architectures and ensemble weights as architecture parameters\nand uses gradient-based architecture search to obtain optimal configurations,\nand AutoHEnsGNN$_{\\text{Adaptive}}$, which can adaptively adjust the ensemble\nweight based on the model accuracy.

    "abstract": "In the trial-and-error mechanism of reinforcement learning (RL), a notorious\ncontradiction arises when we expect to learn a safe policy: how to learn a safe\npolicy without enough data and prior model about the dangerous region? Existing\nmethods mostly use the posterior penalty for dangerous actions, which means\nthat the agent is not penalized until experiencing danger. This fact causes\nthat the agent cannot learn a zero-violation policy even after convergence.\nOtherwise, it would not receive any penalty and lose the knowledge about\ndanger. In this paper, we propose the safe set actor-critic (SSAC) algorithm,\nwhich confines the policy update using safety-oriented energy functions, or the\nsafety indexes. The safety index is designed to increase rapidly for\npotentially dangerous actions, which allows us to locate the safe set on the\naction space, or the control safe set. Therefore, we can identify the dangerous\nactions prior to taking them, and further obtain a zero constraint-violation\npolicy after convergence.We claim that we can learn the energy function in a\nmodel-free manner similar to learning a value function. By using the energy\nfunction transition as the constraint objective, we formulate a constrained RL\nproblem. We prove that our Lagrangian-based solutions make sure that the\nlearned policy will converge to the constrained optimum under some assumptions.\nThe proposed algorithm is evaluated on both the complex simulation environments\nand a hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiment with a real controller from the\nautonomous vehicle. Experimental results suggest that the converged policy in\nall environments achieves zero constraint violation and comparable performance\nwith model-based baselines.",

To this\nend, data poisoning based backdoor attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) in\nthe production stage (or training stage) and corresponding defenses are\nextensively explored in recent years. Ironically, backdoor attacks in the\ndeployment stage, which can often happen in unprofessional users' devices and\nare thus arguably far more threatening in real-world scenarios, draw much less\nattention of the community. We attribute this imbalance of vigilance to the\nweak practicality of existing deployment-stage backdoor attack algorithms and\nthe insufficiency of real-world attack demonstrations. To fill the blank, in\nthis work, we study the realistic threat of deployment-stage backdoor attacks\non DNNs. We base our study on a commonly used deployment-stage attack paradigm\n-- adversarial weight attack, where adversaries selectively modify model\nweights to embed backdoor into deployed DNNs. To approach realistic\npracticality, we propose the first gray-box and physically realizable weights\nattack algorithm for backdoor injection, namely subnet replacement attack\n(SRA), which only requires architecture information of the victim model and can\nsupport physical triggers in the real world. Extensive experimental simulations\nand system-level real-world attack demonstrations are conducted. Our results\nnot only suggest the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed attack\nalgorithm, but also reveal the practical risk of a novel type of computer virus\nthat may widely spread and stealthily inject backdoor into DNN models in user\ndevices.

In pursuit of aesthetically pleasing photos,\npeople usually regard the bokeh effect as an indispensable part of the photo.\nDue to its natural advantage and universality, as well as the fact that many\nvisual recognition tasks can already be negatively affected by the `natural\nbokeh' phenomenon, in this work, we systematically study the bokeh effect from\na new angle, i.e., adversarial bokeh attack (AdvBokeh) that aims to embed\ncalculated deceptive information into the bokeh generation and produce a\nnatural adversarial example without any human-noticeable noise artifacts. To\nthis end, we first propose a Depth-guided Bokeh Synthesis Network (DebsNet)\nthat is able to flexibly synthesis, refocus, and adjust the level of bokeh of\nthe image, with a one-stage training procedure. The DebsNet allows us to tap\ninto the bokeh generation process and attack the depth map that is needed for\ngenerating realistic bokeh (i.e., adversarially tuning the depth map) based on\nsubsequent visual tasks. To further improve the realisticity of the adversarial\nbokeh, we propose depth-guided gradient-based attack to regularize the\ngradient.We validate the proposed method on a popular adversarial image\nclassification dataset, i.e., NeurIPS-2017 DEV, and show that the proposed\nmethod can penetrate four state-of-the-art (SOTA) image classification networks\ni.e., ResNet50, VGG, DenseNet, and MobileNetV2 with a high success rate as well\nas high image quality.

Crucial for our approach is the\nidea that the notion of an intervention can be used as a formal expression of a\n(real or hypothetical) experiment. In a first step we extend the well-known\ncausal models with a simple Hintikka-style representation of the epistemic\nstate of an agent. In the resulting setting, one can talk not only about the\nknowledge of an agent about the values of variables and how interventions\naffect them, but also about knowledge update. The resulting logic can model\nreasoning about thought experiments. However, it is unable to account for\nlearning from experiments, which is clearly brought out by the fact that it\nvalidates the no learning principle for interventions. Therefore, in a second\nstep, we implement a more complex notion of knowledge that allows an agent to\nobserve (measure) certain variables when an experiment is carried out. This\nextended system does allow for learning from experiments. For all the proposed\nlogical systems, we provide a sound and complete axiomatization.",

Prior\nalgorithms for this problem either incur exponential running time, require\n$\\Omega(d^{1.5})$ samples, or satisfy only the weaker concentrated or\napproximate differential privacy conditions. In particular, all prior\npolynomial-time algorithms require $d^{1+\\Omega(1)}$ samples to guarantee small\nprivacy loss with \"cryptographically\" high probability, $1-2^{-d^{\\Omega(1)}}$,\nwhile our algorithm retains $\\tilde{O}(d)$ sample complexity even in this\nstringent setting.\nOur main technique is a new approach to use the powerful Sum of Squares\nmethod (SoS) to design differentially private algorithms. SoS proofs to\nalgorithms is a key theme in numerous recent works in high-dimensional\nalgorithmic statistics -- estimators which apparently require exponential\nrunning time but whose analysis can be captured by low-degree Sum of Squares\nproofs can be automatically turned into polynomial-time algorithms with the\nsame provable guarantees. We demonstrate a similar proofs to private algorithms\nphenomenon: instances of the workhorse exponential mechanism which apparently\nrequire exponential time but which can be analyzed with low-degree SoS proofs\ncan be automatically turned into polynomial-time differentially private\nalgorithms. We prove a meta-theorem capturing this phenomenon, which we expect\nto be of broad use in private algorithm design.\nOur techniques also draw new connections between differentially private and\nrobust statistics in high dimensions. In particular, viewed through our\nproofs-to-private-algorithms lens, several well-studied SoS proofs from recent\nworks in algorithmic robust statistics directly yield key components of our\ndifferentially private mean estimation algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Is intelligence realized by connectionist or classicist? While connectionist\napproaches have achieved superhuman performance, there has been growing\nevidence that such task-specific superiority is particularly fragile in\nsystematic generalization. This observation lies in the central debate between\nconnectionist and classicist, wherein the latter continually advocates an\nalgebraic treatment in cognitive architectures. In this work, we follow the\nclassicist's call and propose a hybrid approach to improve systematic\ngeneralization in reasoning. Specifically, we showcase a prototype with\nalgebraic representation for the abstract spatial-temporal reasoning task of\nRaven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and present the ALgebra-Aware\nNeuro-Semi-Symbolic (ALANS) learner. The ALANS learner is motivated by abstract\nalgebra and the representation theory. It consists of a neural visual\nperception frontend and an algebraic abstract reasoning backend: the frontend\nsummarizes the visual information from object-based representation, while the\nbackend transforms it into an algebraic structure and induces the hidden\noperator on the fly. The induced operator is later executed to predict the\nanswer's representation, and the choice most similar to the prediction is\nselected as the solution. Extensive experiments show that by incorporating an\nalgebraic treatment, the ALANS learner outperforms various pure connectionist\nmodels in domains requiring systematic generalization. We further show that the\nalgebraic representation learned can be decoded by isomorphism to generate an\nanswer.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Vision Transformers (ViT), with the self-attention (SA) as the de\nfacto ingredients, have demonstrated great potential in the computer vision\ncommunity. For the sake of trade-off between efficiency and performance, a\ngroup of works merely perform SA operation within local patches, whereas the\nglobal contextual information is abandoned, which would be indispensable for\nvisual recognition tasks. To solve the issue, the subsequent global-local ViTs\ntake a stab at marrying local SA with global one in parallel or alternative way\nin the model. Nevertheless, the exhaustively combined local and global context\nmay exist redundancy for various visual data, and the receptive field within\neach layer is fixed. Alternatively, a more graceful way is that global and\nlocal context can adaptively contribute per se to accommodate different visual\ndata. To achieve this goal, we in this paper propose a novel ViT architecture,\ntermed NomMer, which can dynamically Nominate the synergistic global-local\ncontext in vision transforMer. By investigating the working pattern of our\nproposed NomMer, we further explore what context information is focused.\nBeneficial from this \"dynamic nomination\" mechanism, without bells and\nwhistles, the NomMer can not only achieve 84.5% Top-1 classification accuracy\non ImageNet with only 73M parameters, but also show promising performance on\ndense prediction tasks, i.e., object detection and semantic segmentation.

Building models describing dynamics of complex\nprocesses (e.g., weather dynamics, or reactive flows) using empirical knowledge\nor first principles are onerous or infeasible. Moreover, these models are\nhigh-dimensional but spatially correlated. It is, however, observed that the\ndynamics of high-fidelity models often evolve in low-dimensional manifolds.\nFurthermore, it is also known that for sufficiently smooth vector fields\ndefining the nonlinear dynamics, a quadratic model can describe it accurately\nin an appropriate coordinate system, conferring to the McCormick relaxation\nidea in nonconvex optimization. Here, we aim at finding a low-dimensional\nembedding of high-fidelity dynamical data, ensuring a simple quadratic model to\nexplain its dynamics. To that aim, this work leverages deep learning to\nidentify low-dimensional quadratic embeddings for high-fidelity dynamical\nsystems. Precisely, we identify the embedding of data using an autoencoder to\nhave the desired property of the embedding. We also embed a Runge-Kutta method\nto avoid the time-derivative computations, which is often a challenge.

Those measurements, however, are costly to produce,\nespecially in recordings that change throughout long periods of time. However,\nexisting annotated databases for ECG delineation are small, being insufficient\nin size and in the array of pathological conditions they represent. This\narticle delves has two main contributions. First, a pseudo-synthetic data\ngeneration algorithm was developed, based in probabilistically composing ECG\ntraces given \"pools\" of fundamental segments, as cropped from the original\ndatabases, and a set of rules for their arrangement into coherent synthetic\ntraces. The generation of conditions is controlled by imposing expert knowledge\non the generated trace, which increases the input variability for training the\nmodel. Second, two novel segmentation-based loss functions have been developed,\nwhich attempt at enforcing the prediction of an exact number of independent\nstructures and at producing closer segmentation boundaries by focusing on a\nreduced number of samples. The best performing model obtained an $F_1$-score of\n99.38\\% and a delineation error of $2.19 \\pm 17.73$ ms and $4.45 \\pm 18.32$ ms\nfor all wave's fiducials (onsets and offsets, respectively), as averaged across\nthe P, QRS and T waves for three distinct freely available databases.

When\n$K=\\overline{k(t)}$ is the field of algebraic functions in $t$ over a field $k$\nof characteristic zero, Eremenko in 1998 proved the following quasi-equivalence\nfor an absolute logarithmic height $\\mathfrak{h}$ in $K$: Given $P\\in K[X,Y]$\nirreducible over $K$ and $\\epsilon>0$, there is a constant $C$ only depending\non $P$ and $\\epsilon$ such that for each $(a,b)\\in K^2$ with $P(a,b)=0$, $$\n(1-\\epsilon) \\deg(P,Y) \\mathfrak{h}(b)-C \\leq \\deg(P,X) \\mathfrak{h}(a) \\leq\n(1+\\epsilon) \\deg(P,Y) \\mathfrak{h}(b)+C. $$ In this article, we shall give an\nexplicit bound for the constant $C$ in terms of the total degree of $P$, the\nheight of $P$ and $\\epsilon$. This result is expected to have applications in\nsome other areas such as symbolic computation of differential and difference\nequations.",

    "abstract": "Equality saturation is a technique for implementing rewrite-driven compiler\noptimizations by efficiently representing many equivalent programs in so-called\ne-graphs. To improve performance, the set of equivalent programs is grown by\napplying rewrites in a purely additive way until a fixed point is reached\n(saturation), or the search times out. In practice, two issues limit the\napplication of equality saturation in programming language compilers. First,\nequality saturation is not efficient for the name bindings (variables) that\nappear in almost all programming languages. Second, equality saturation does\nnot scale to complex optimizations with long rewrite sequences such as loop\nblocking. This paper addresses both issues, thereby enabling equality\nsaturation to be applied to more realistic programs and compiler optimizations.\nFirst, we demonstrate how to drastically improve the efficiency of equality\nsaturation for a functional language based on the typed lambda calculus.\nSecond, we introduce sketch-guided equality saturation, a semi-automatic\ntechnique that allows programmers to provide sketches guiding rewriting when\nperforming complex optimizations. We evaluate sketch-guided equality saturation\nby performing a series of realistic optimizations of matrix multiplication\nexpressed in the Rise functional language. The optimizations include loop\nblocking, vectorization, and parallelization. We demonstrate that naive\nequality saturation does not scale to these optimizations, even with hours of\nexploration time. Previous work on orchestrating rewrite sequences shows that\nthese optimizations can be expressed as rewrites, at the cost of weeks of\nprogrammer effort. Our guided equality saturation combines the advantages of\nboth techniques: minimal programmer guidance enables complex compiler\noptimizations to be applied in seconds.",

To answer the normative questions, law\nand regulation seeks a narrative explanation, a story.

    "abstract": "Joint parcel delivery by trucks and drones has enjoyed significant attention\nfor some time, as the advantages of one delivery method offset the\ndisadvantages of the other. This paper focuses on the vehicle routing problem\nwith drones and drone speed selection (VRPD-DSS), which considers\nspeed-dependent energy consumption and drone-charging in detail. For this\npurpose, we formulate a comprehensive mixed-integer problem that aims to\nminimize the operational costs consisting of fuel consumption costs of the\ntrucks, labor costs for the drivers, and energy costs of the drones. The speed\nat which a drone performs a flight must be selected from a discrete set. We\nintroduce preprocessing steps to eliminate dominated speeds for a flight to\nreduce the problem size and use valid inequalities to accelerate the solution\nprocess. The consideration of speed-dependent energy consumption leads to the\nfact that it is advisable to perform different flights at different speeds and\nnot to consistently operate a drone at maximum speed. Instead, drone speed\nshould be selected to balance drone range and speed of delivery. Our extensive\ncomputational study of a rural real-world setting shows that, by modeling\nenergy consumption realistically, the savings in operational costs compared to\ntruck-only delivery are significant but smaller than those identified in\npreviously published work. Our analysis further reveals that the greatest\nsavings stem from the fact that overall delivery time decreases compared to\ntruck-only delivery, allowing costly truck-driver time to be reduced. The\nadditional energy costs of the drone, however, are largely negligible.",

IR\nbenchmarks evaluate the effectiveness of retrieval pipelines based on the\npremise that a single query is used to instantiate the underlying information\nneed.

    "abstract": "Stream processing applications extract value from raw data through Directed\nAcyclic Graphs of data analysis tasks. Shared-nothing (SN) parallelism is the\nde-facto standard to scale stream processing applications. Given an\napplication, SN parallelism instantiates several copies of each analysis task,\nmaking each instance responsible for a dedicated portion of the overall\nanalysis, and relies on dedicated queues to exchange data among connected\ninstances. On the one hand, SN parallelism can scale the execution of\napplications both up and out since threads can run task instances within and\nacross processes/nodes. On the other hand, its lack of sharing can cause\nunnecessary overheads and hinder the scaling up when threads operate on data\nthat could be jointly accessed in shared memory. This trade-off motivated us in\nstudying a way for stream processing applications to leverage shared memory and\nboost the scale up (before the scale out) while adhering to the widely-adopted\nand SN-based APIs for stream processing applications.\nWe introduce STRETCH, a framework that maximizes the scale up and offers\ninstantaneous elastic reconfigurations (without state transfer) for stream\nprocessing applications.

    "abstract": "Despite their massive success, training successful deep neural networks still\nlargely relies on experimentally choosing an architecture, hyper-parameters,\ninitialization, and training mechanism. In this work, we focus on determining\nthe success of standard gradient descent method for training deep neural\nnetworks on a specified dataset, architecture, and initialization (DAI)\ncombination. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show that the\nevolution of singular values of the matrix obtained from the hidden layers of a\nDNN can aid in determining the success of gradient descent technique to train a\nDAI, even in the absence of validation labels in the supervised learning\nparadigm. This phenomenon can facilitate early give-up, stopping the training\nof neural networks which are predicted to not generalize well, early in the\ntraining process. Our experimentation across multiple datasets, architectures,\nand initializations reveals that the proposed scores can more accurately\npredict the success of a DAI than simply relying on the validation accuracy at\nearlier epochs to make a judgment.",

    "abstract": "Collecting large clean-distorted training image pairs in real world is\nnon-trivial, which seriously limits the practical applications of these\nsupervised learning based image restoration (IR) methods. Previous works\nattempt to address this problem by leveraging unsupervised learning\ntechnologies to alleviate the dependency for paired training samples. However,\nthese methods typically suffer from unsatisfactory textures synthesis due to\nthe lack of clean image supervision. Compared with purely unsupervised\nsolution, the under-explored scheme with Few-Shot clean images (FS-IR) is more\nfeasible to tackle this challenging real Image Restoration task. In this paper,\nwe are the first to investigate the few-shot real image restoration and propose\na Distortion-Relation guided Transfer Learning (termed as DRTL) framework. DRTL\nassigns a knowledge graph to capture the distortion relation between auxiliary\ntasks (i.e., synthetic distortions) and target tasks (i.e., real distortions\nwith few images), and then adopt a gradient weighting strategy to guide the\nknowledge transfer from auxiliary task to target task. In this way, DRTL could\nquickly learn the most relevant knowledge from the prior distortions for target\ndistortion. We instantiate DRTL integrated with pre-training and meta-learning\npipelines as an embodiment to realize a distortion-relation aware FS-IR.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of\nDRTL on few-shot real image restoration.",

    "abstract": "We propose a learning-based method for light-path construction in path\ntracing algorithms, which iteratively optimizes and samples from what we refer\nto as spatio-directional Gaussian mixture models (SDMMs). In particular, we\napproximate incident radiance as an online-trained $5$D mixture that is\naccelerated by a $k$D-tree. Using the same framework, we approximate BSDFs as\npre-trained $n$D mixtures, where $n$ is the number of BSDF parameters. Such an\napproach addresses two major challenges in path-guiding models. First, the $5$D\nradiance representation naturally captures correlation between the spatial and\ndirectional dimensions. Such correlations are present in e.g.\\ parallax and\ncaustics. Second, by using a tangent-space parameterization of Gaussians, our\nspatio-directional mixtures can perform approximate product sampling with\narbitrarily oriented BSDFs. Existing models are only able to do this by either\nforegoing anisotropy of the mixture components or by representing the radiance\nfield in local (normal aligned) coordinates, which both make the radiance field\nmore difficult to learn. An additional benefit of the tangent-space\nparameterization is that each individual Gaussian is mapped to the solid sphere\nwith low distortion near its center of mass. Our method performs especially\nwell on scenes with small, localized luminaires that induce high\nspatio-directional correlation in the incident radiance.",

However, NeRF's big limitation is its slow\nspeed. Many attempts are made to speeding up NeRF training and inference,\nincluding intricate code-level optimization and caching, use of sophisticated\ndata structures, and amortization through multi-task and meta learning. In this\nwork, we revisit the basic building blocks of NeRF through the lens of classic\ntechniques before NeRF. We propose Voxel-Accelearated NeRF (VaxNeRF),\nintegrating NeRF with visual hull, a classic 3D reconstruction technique only\nrequiring binary foreground-background pixel labels per image. Visual hull,\nwhich can be optimized in about 10 seconds, can provide coarse in-out field\nseparation to omit substantial amounts of network evaluations in NeRF. We\nprovide a clean fully-pythonic, JAX-based implementation on the popular JaxNeRF\ncodebase, consisting of only about 30 lines of code changes and a modular\nvisual hull subroutine, and achieve about 2-8x faster learning on top of the\nhighly-performative JaxNeRF baseline with zero degradation in rendering\nquality. With sufficient compute, this effectively brings down full NeRF\ntraining from hours to 30 minutes.

For example, in the medical\ndomain, a clinical guideline describing the treatment of a specific disease\ncannot account for all possible co-factors that can coexist for a specific\npatient and therefore additional constraints may need to be considered. In some\ncases, these constraints may be incompatible with clinical guidelines,\ntherefore requiring the violation of either the guidelines or the constraints.\nIn this paper, we propose a solution for monitoring the interplay of hybrid\nprocess specifications expressed as a combination of (data-aware) Petri nets\nand temporal logic rules. During the process execution, if these specifications\nare in conflict with each other, it is possible to violate some of them. The\nmonitoring system is equipped with a violation cost model according to which\nthe system can recommend the next course of actions in a way that would either\navoid possible violations or minimize the total cost of violations.",

While traditional in situ or aerial campaigns for forest assessments\nprovide accurate data for analysis at regional level, scaling them to entire\ncountries and beyond with high temporal resolution is hardly possible. In this\nwork, we propose a Bayesian deep learning approach to densely estimate forest\nstructure variables at country-scale with 10-meter resolution, using freely\navailable satellite imagery as input. Our method jointly transforms Sentinel-2\noptical images and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar images into maps of five\ndifferent forest structure variables: 95th height percentile, mean height,\ndensity, Gini coefficient, and fractional cover. We train and test our model on\nreference data from 41 airborne laser scanning missions across Norway and\ndemonstrate that it is able to generalize to unseen test regions, achieving\nnormalized mean absolute errors between 11% and 15%, depending on the variable.\nOur work is also the first to propose a Bayesian deep learning approach so as\nto predict forest structure variables with well-calibrated uncertainty\nestimates.

    "title": "Intrinsic Dimension, Persistent Homology and Generalization in Neural  Networks",
    "abstract": "Disobeying the classical wisdom of statistical learning theory, modern deep\nneural networks generalize well even though they typically contain millions of\nparameters. Recently, it has been shown that the trajectories of iterative\noptimization algorithms can possess fractal structures, and their\ngeneralization error can be formally linked to the complexity of such fractals.\nThis complexity is measured by the fractal's intrinsic dimension, a quantity\nusually much smaller than the number of parameters in the network. Even though\nthis perspective provides an explanation for why overparametrized networks\nwould not overfit, computing the intrinsic dimension (e.g., for monitoring\ngeneralization during training) is a notoriously difficult task, where existing\nmethods typically fail even in moderate ambient dimensions. In this study, we\nconsider this problem from the lens of topological data analysis (TDA) and\ndevelop a generic computational tool that is built on rigorous mathematical\nfoundations. By making a novel connection between learning theory and TDA, we\nfirst illustrate that the generalization error can be equivalently bounded in\nterms of a notion called the 'persistent homology dimension' (PHD), where,\ncompared with prior work, our approach does not require any additional\ngeometrical or statistical assumptions on the training dynamics. Then, by\nutilizing recently established theoretical results and TDA tools, we develop an\nefficient algorithm to estimate PHD in the scale of modern deep neural networks\nand further provide visualization tools to help understand generalization in\ndeep learning. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can efficiently\ncompute a network's intrinsic dimension in a variety of settings, which is\npredictive of the generalization error.",

The models are typically controlled by free\nparameters that are estimated from data by maximum-likelihood estimation.\nHowever, when faced with real-world datasets many of the models run into a\ncritical issue: they are formulated in terms of fully-observed data, whereas in\npractice the datasets are plagued with missing data. The theory of statistical\nmodel estimation from incomplete data is conceptually similar to the estimation\nof latent-variable models, where powerful tools such as variational inference\n(VI) exist. However, in contrast to standard latent-variable models, parameter\nestimation with incomplete data often requires estimating exponentially-many\nconditional distributions of the missing variables, hence making standard VI\nmethods intractable. We address this gap by introducing variational Gibbs\ninference (VGI), a new general-purpose method to estimate the parameters of\nstatistical models from incomplete data. We validate VGI on a set of synthetic\nand real-world estimation tasks, estimating important machine learning models,\nVAEs and normalising flows, from incomplete data.

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks have successfully tackled a large variety of\nproblems by training extremely deep networks via back-propagation. A direct\napplication of back-propagation to spiking neural networks contains\nbiologically implausible components, like the weight transport problem or\nseparate inference and learning phases. Various methods address different\ncomponents individually, but a complete solution remains intangible. Here, we\ntake an alternate approach that avoids back-propagation and its associated\nissues entirely. Recent work in deep learning proposed independently training\neach layer of a network via the information bottleneck (IB). Subsequent studies\nnoted that this layer-wise approach circumvents error propagation across\nlayers, leading to a biologically plausible paradigm. Unfortunately, the IB is\ncomputed using a batch of samples. The prior work addresses this with a weight\nupdate that only uses two samples (the current and previous sample). Our work\ntakes a different approach by decomposing the weight update into a local and\nglobal component. The local component is Hebbian and only depends on the\ncurrent sample. The global component computes a layer-wise modulatory signal\nthat depends on a batch of samples. We show that this modulatory signal can be\nlearned by an auxiliary circuit with working memory (WM) like a reservoir.\nThus, we can use batch sizes greater than two, and the batch size determines\nthe required capacity of the WM. To the best of our knowledge, our rule is the\nfirst biologically plausible mechanism to directly couple synaptic updates with\na WM of the task. We evaluate our rule on synthetic datasets and image\nclassification datasets like MNIST, and we explore the effect of the WM\ncapacity on learning performance. We hope our work is a first-step towards\nunderstanding the mechanistic role of memory in learning.",

Comparing to the recent development of\nbackpropagation-based (BP-based) methods that are able to train spiking neural\nnetworks (SNNs) with high accuracy, biologically plausible methods are still in\ntheir infancy. In this work, we wish to answer the question of whether it is\npossible to attain comparable accuracy of SNNs trained by BP-based rules with\nbio-plausible mechanisms. We propose a new bio-plausible learning framework,\nconsisting of two components: a new architecture, and its supporting learning\nrules.

These feature\nextractors usually operate on video frames sampled at a fixed frame rate and\nare often trained on image/video understanding tasks, without adaption to video\ncaptioning data. In this work, we present SwinBERT, an end-to-end\ntransformer-based model for video captioning, which takes video frame patches\ndirectly as inputs, and outputs a natural language description. Instead of\nleveraging multiple 2D/3D feature extractors, our method adopts a video\ntransformer to encode spatial-temporal representations that can adapt to\nvariable lengths of video input without dedicated design for different frame\nrates. Based on this model architecture, we show that video captioning can\nbenefit significantly from more densely sampled video frames as opposed to\nprevious successes with sparsely sampled video frames for video-and-language\nunderstanding tasks (e.g., video question answering). Moreover, to avoid the\ninherent redundancy in consecutive video frames, we propose adaptively learning\na sparse attention mask and optimizing it for task-specific performance\nimprovement through better long-range video sequence modeling. Through\nextensive experiments on 5 video captioning datasets, we show that SwinBERT\nachieves across-the-board performance improvements over previous methods, often\nby a large margin.

    "title": "Cross-Domain Object Detection via Adaptive Self-Training",
    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of domain adaptation in object detection, where there\nis a significant domain shift between a source (a domain with supervision) and\na target domain (a domain of interest without supervision). As a widely adopted\ndomain adaptation method, the self-training teacher-student framework (a\nstudent model learns from pseudo labels generated from a teacher model) has\nyielded remarkable accuracy gain on the target domain. However, it still\nsuffers from the large amount of low-quality pseudo labels (e.g., false\npositives) generated from the teacher due to its bias toward the source domain.\nTo address this issue, we propose a self-training framework called Adaptive\nUnbiased Teacher (AUT) leveraging adversarial learning and weak-strong data\naugmentation during mutual learning to address domain shift. Specifically, we\nemploy feature-level adversarial training in the student model, ensuring\nfeatures extracted from the source and target domains share similar statistics.\nThis enables the student model to capture domain-invariant features.\nFurthermore, we apply weak-strong augmentation and mutual learning between the\nteacher model on the target domain and the student model on both domains. This\nenables the teacher model to gradually benefit from the student model without\nsuffering domain shift. We show that AUT demonstrates superiority over all\nexisting approaches and even Oracle (fully supervised) models by a large\nmargin. For example, we achieve 50.9% (49.3%) mAP on Foggy Cityscape\n(Clipart1K), which is 9.2% (5.2%) and 8.2% (11.0%) higher than previous\nstate-of-the-art and Oracle, respectively",

EP approximates the posterior by\niteratively refining approximations to the local likelihoods, and is known to\nprovide better posterior uncertainties than those by variational inference\n(VI). However, using EP for large-scale datasets imposes a challenge in terms\nof memory requirements as it needs to maintain each of the local approximates\nin memory. To overcome this problem, stochastic expectation propagation (SEP)\nwas proposed, which only considers a unique local factor that captures the\naverage effect of each likelihood term to the posterior and refines it in a way\nanalogous to EP. In terms of privacy, SEP is more tractable than EP because at\neach refining step of a factor, the remaining factors are fixed to the same\nvalue and do not depend on other datapoints as in EP, which makes the\nsensitivity analysis tractable. We provide a theoretical analysis of the\nprivacy-accuracy trade-off in the posterior estimates under differentially\nprivate stochastic expectation propagation (DP-SEP).

Performing\nsuch optimization, however, is traditionally quite costly, as it involves a\ncomplete forward and backward pass through the network for each gradient step.\nIn a separate line of work, a recent thread of research has developed the deep\nequilibrium (DEQ) model, a class of models that foregoes traditional network\ndepth and instead computes the output of a network by finding the fixed point\nof a single nonlinear layer. In this paper, we show that there is a natural\nsynergy between these two settings. Although, naively using DEQs for these\noptimization problems is expensive (owing to the time needed to compute a fixed\npoint for each gradient step), we can leverage the fact that gradient-based\noptimization can \\emph{itself} be cast as a fixed point iteration to\nsubstantially improve the overall speed. That is, we \\emph{simultaneously} both\nsolve for the DEQ fixed point \\emph{and} optimize over network inputs, all\nwithin a single ``augmented'' DEQ model that jointly encodes both the original\nnetwork and the optimization process. Indeed, the procedure is fast enough that\nit allows us to efficiently \\emph{train} DEQ models for tasks traditionally\nrelying on an ``inner'' optimization loop. We demonstrate this strategy on\nvarious tasks such as training generative models while optimizing over latent\ncodes, training models for inverse problems like denoising and inpainting,\nadversarial training and gradient based meta-learning.",

    "abstract": "For an $n$-vertex digraph $G=(V,E)$, a \\emph{shortcut set} is a (small)\nsubset of edges $H$ taken from the transitive closure of $G$ that, when added\nto $G$ guarantees that the diameter of $G \\cup H$ is small. Shortcut sets,\nintroduced by Thorup in 1993, have a wide range of applications in algorithm\ndesign, especially in the context of parallel, distributed and dynamic\ncomputation on directed graphs. A folklore result in this context shows that\nevery $n$-vertex digraph admits a shortcut set of linear size (i.e., of $O(n)$\nedges) that reduces the diameter to $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$. Despite\nextensive research over the years, the question of whether one can reduce the\ndiameter to $o(\\sqrt{n})$ with $\\widetilde{O}(n)$ shortcut edges has been left\nopen.\nWe provide the first improved diameter-sparsity tradeoff for this problem,\nbreaking the $\\sqrt{n}$ diameter barrier. Specifically, we show an\n$O(n^{\\omega})$-time randomized algorithm for computing a linear shortcut set\nthat reduces the diameter of the digraph to $\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})$. This\nnarrows the gap w.r.t the current diameter lower bound of $\\Omega(n^{1/6})$ by\n[Huang and Pettie, SWAT'18]. Moreover, we show that a diameter of\n$\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$ can in fact be achieved with a \\emph{sublinear} number\nof $O(n^{3/4})$ shortcut edges. Formally, letting $S(n,D)$ be the bound on the\nsize of the shortcut set required in order to reduce the diameter of any\n$n$-vertex digraph to at most $D$, our algorithms yield: \\[\nS(n,D)=\\begin{cases} \\widetilde{O}(n^2/D^3), & \\text{for~} D\\leq n^{1/3},\\\\\n\\widetilde{O}((n/D)^{3/2}), & \\text{for~} D> n^{1/3}~. \\end{cases} \\] We also\nextend our algorithms to provide improved $(\\beta,\\epsilon)$ hopsets for\n$n$-vertex weighted directed graphs.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that imperceptible perturbations can be applied to\ncraft unlearnable examples (ULEs), i.e. images whose content cannot be used to\nimprove a classifier during training. In this paper, we reveal the road that\nresearchers should follow for understanding ULEs and improving ULEs as they\nwere originally formulated (ULEOs). The paper makes four contributions. First,\nwe show that ULEOs exploit color and, consequently, their effects can be\nmitigated by simple grayscale pre-filtering, without resorting to adversarial\ntraining. Second, we propose an extension to ULEOs, which is called\nULEO-GrayAugs, that forces the generated ULEs away from channel-wise color\nperturbations by making use of grayscale knowledge and data augmentations\nduring optimization. Third, we show that ULEOs generated using Multi-Layer\nPerceptrons (MLPs) are effective in the case of complex Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) classifiers, suggesting that CNNs suffer specific vulnerability\nto ULEs. Fourth, we demonstrate that when a classifier is trained on ULEOs,\nadversarial training will prevent a drop in accuracy measured both on clean\nimages and on adversarial images. Taken together, our contributions represent a\nsubstantial advance in the state of art of unlearnable examples, but also\nreveal important characteristics of their behavior that must be better\nunderstood in order to achieve further improvements.",

In practical applications, the large\ndimension of the dynamical system state poses a computational obstacle to\ncomputing the exact posterior distribution. Model reduction offers a variety of\ncomputational tools that seek to reduce this computational burden. In\nparticular, balanced truncation is a system-theoretic approach to model\nreduction which obtains an efficient reduced-dimension dynamical system by\nprojecting the system operators onto state directions which trade off the\nreachability and observability of state directions as expressed through the\nassociated Gramians. We introduce Gramian definitions relevant to the inference\nsetting and propose a balanced truncation approach based on these inference\nGramians that yield a reduced dynamical system that can be used to cheaply\napproximate the posterior mean and covariance. Our definitions exploit natural\nconnections between (i) the reachability Gramian and the prior covariance and\n(ii) the observability Gramian and the Fisher information. The resulting\nreduced model then inherits stability properties and error bounds from system\ntheoretic considerations, and in some settings yields an optimal posterior\ncovariance approximation.

The proposed\nmethodology leverages real-time kinematic information broadcast via the\nAutomatic Information System (AIS) messaging protocol, in order to estimate the\nposition, speed, and heading of nearby cooperative targets. The state of each\ntarget is recursively estimated in geodetic coordinates using an unscented\nKalman filter (UKF) with kinematic equations derived from the spherical law of\ncosines. This improves upon previous approaches, many of which employ the\nextended Kalman filter (EKF), and thus require the specification of a local\nplanar coordinate frame, in order to describe the state kinematics in an easily\ndifferentiable form. The proposed geodetic UKF obviates the need for this local\nplane. This feature is particularly advantageous for long-range ASVs, which\nmust otherwise periodically redefine a new local plane to curtail linearization\nerror. In real-world operations, this recurring redefinition can introduce\nerror and complicate mission planning. It is shown through both simulation and\nfield testing that the proposed geodetic UKF performs as well as, or better\nthan, the traditional plane-Cartesian EKF, both in terms of estimation error\nand stability.",

    "title": "Identification of Bias Against People with Disabilities in Sentiment  Analysis and Toxicity Detection Models",
    "abstract": "Sociodemographic biases are a common problem for natural language processing,\naffecting the fairness and integrity of its applications. Within sentiment\nanalysis, these biases may undermine sentiment predictions for texts that\nmention personal attributes that unbiased human readers would consider neutral.\nSuch discrimination can have great consequences in the applications of\nsentiment analysis both in the public and private sectors. For example,\nincorrect inferences in applications like online abuse and opinion analysis in\nsocial media platforms can lead to unwanted ramifications, such as wrongful\ncensoring, towards certain populations. In this paper, we address the\ndiscrimination against people with disabilities, PWD, done by sentiment\nanalysis and toxicity classification models. We provide an examination of\nsentiment and toxicity analysis models to understand in detail how they\ndiscriminate PWD. We present the Bias Identification Test in Sentiments (BITS),\na corpus of 1,126 sentences designed to probe sentiment analysis models for\nbiases in disability. We use this corpus to demonstrate statistically\nsignificant biases in four widely used sentiment analysis tools (TextBlob,\nVADER, Google Cloud Natural Language API and DistilBERT) and two toxicity\nanalysis models trained to predict toxic comments on Jigsaw challenges (Toxic\ncomment classification and Unintended Bias in Toxic comments). The results show\nthat all exhibit strong negative biases on sentences that mention disability.\nWe publicly release BITS Corpus for others to identify potential biases against\ndisability in any sentiment analysis tools and also to update the corpus to be\nused as a test for other sociodemographic variables as well.",

    "abstract": "We present NeSF, a method for producing 3D semantic fields from posed RGB\nimages alone. In place of classical 3D representations, our method builds on\nrecent work in implicit neural scene representations wherein 3D structure is\ncaptured by point-wise functions. We leverage this methodology to recover 3D\ndensity fields upon which we then train a 3D semantic segmentation model\nsupervised by posed 2D semantic maps. Despite being trained on 2D signals\nalone, our method is able to generate 3D-consistent semantic maps from novel\ncamera poses and can be queried at arbitrary 3D points. Notably, NeSF is\ncompatible with any method producing a density field, and its accuracy improves\nas the quality of the density field improves. Our empirical analysis\ndemonstrates comparable quality to competitive 2D and 3D semantic segmentation\nbaselines on complex, realistically rendered synthetic scenes. Our method is\nthe first to offer truly dense 3D scene segmentations requiring only 2D\nsupervision for training, and does not require any semantic input for inference\non novel scenes.

    "abstract": "It is well known [Lov\\'{a}sz, 1967] that up to isomorphism a graph $G$ is\ndetermined by the homomorphism counts $\\hom(F, G)$, i.e., the number of\nhomomorphisms from $F$ to $G$, where $F$ ranges over all graphs. Moreover, it\nsuffices that $F$ ranges over the graphs with at most as many vertices as $G$.\nThus in principle we can answer any query concerning $G$ with only accessing\nthe $\\hom(\\cdot,G)$'s instead of $G$ itself. In this paper, we zoom in on those\nqueries that can be answered using a constant number of $\\hom(\\cdot,G)$ for\nevery graph $G$. We observe that if a query $\\varphi$ is expressible as a\nBoolean combination of universal sentences in first-order logic, then whether a\ngraph $G$ satisfies $\\varphi$ can be determined by the vector\n\\[\\overrightarrow{\\mathrm{hom}}_{F_1, \\ldots, F_k}(G):= \\big(\\mathrm{hom}(F_1,\nG), \\ldots, \\mathrm{hom}(F_k, G)\\big),\\] where the graphs $F_1,\\ldots,F_k$ only\ndepend on $\\varphi$. This leads to a query algorithm for $\\varphi$ that is\nnon-adaptive in the sense that those $F_i$ are independent of the input $G$. On\nthe other hand, we prove that the existence of an isolated vertex, which is not\ndefinable by such a $\\varphi$ but in first-order logic, cannot be determined by\nany $\\overrightarrow{\\mathrm{hom}}_{F_1, \\ldots, F_k}(\\cdot)$. These results\nprovide a clear delineation of the power of non-adaptive query algorithms with\naccess to a constant number of $\\hom(\\cdot, G)$'s.\nFor adaptive query algorithms, i.e., algorithms that might access some\n$\\hom(F_{i+1}, G)$ with $F_{i+1}$ depending on $\\hom(F_1, G), \\ldots, \\hom(F_i,\nG)$, we show that three homomorphism counts $\\hom(\\cdot,G)$ are both sufficient\nand in general necessary to determine the graph $G$. In particular, by three\nadaptive queries we can answer any question on $G$. Moreover, adaptively\naccessing two $\\hom(\\cdot, G)$'s is already enough to detect an isolated\nvertex.",

Not to mention, within some regions, COVID-19\nsocial distancing measures have led to a temporary transfer of energy demand\nfrom commercial and urban centers to residential areas, causing an increased\nuse and higher charges, and in turn, creating economic impacts on customers.\nTherefore, the marketplace could benefit from developing an internet of things\n(IoT) ecosystem that monitors energy consumption habits and promptly recommends\naction to facilitate energy efficiency. This paper aims to present the full\nintegration of a proposed energy efficiency framework into the Home-Assistant\nplatform using an edge-based architecture. End-users can visualize their\nconsumption patterns as well as ambient environmental data using the\nHome-Assistant user interface. More notably, explainable energy-saving\nrecommendations are delivered to end-users in the form of notifications via the\nmobile application to facilitate habit change. In this context, to the best of\nthe authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop and implement an\nenergy-saving recommender system on edge devices.

In part, this interest has been stimulated\nby the increased availability of RGBD cameras, and by applications of computer\nvision to autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics. In these settings,\nspectral coordinates have shown promise for shape representation due to their\nability to incorporate both local and global shape properties in a manner that\nis qualitatively invariant to isometric transformations. Yet, surprisingly,\nsuch coordinates have thus far typically considered only local surface\npositional or derivative information. In the present article, we propose to\nequip spectral coordinates with medial (object width) information, so as to\nenrich them. The key idea is to couple surface points that share a medial ball,\nvia the weights of the adjacency matrix. We develop a spectral feature using\nthis idea, and the algorithms to compute it. The incorporation of object width\nand medial coupling has direct benefits, as illustrated by our experiments on\nobject classification, object part segmentation, and surface point\ncorrespondence.",

    "abstract": "Semiconductor device models are essential to understand the charge transport\nin thin film transistors (TFTs). Using these TFT models to draw inference\ninvolves estimating parameters used to fit to the experimental data. These\nexperimental data can involve extracted charge carrier mobility or measured\ncurrent. Estimating these parameters help us draw inferences about device\nperformance. Fitting a TFT model for a given experimental data using the model\nparameters relies on manual fine tuning of multiple parameters by human\nexperts. Several of these parameters may have confounding effects on the\nexperimental data, making their individual effect extraction a non-intuitive\nprocess during manual tuning. To avoid this convoluted process, we propose a\nnew method for automating the model parameter extraction process resulting in\nan accurate model fitting. In this work, model choice based approximate\nBayesian computation (aBc) is used for generating the posterior distribution of\nthe estimated parameters using observed mobility at various gate voltage\nvalues.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning approach like contrastive learning is attached great\nattention in natural language processing. It uses pairs of training data\naugmentations to build a classification task for an encoder with well\nrepresentation ability. However, the construction of learning pairs over\ncontrastive learning is much harder in NLP tasks. Previous works generate\nword-level changes to form pairs, but small transforms may cause notable\nchanges on the meaning of sentences as the discrete and sparse nature of\nnatural language. In this paper, adversarial training is performed to generate\nchallenging and harder learning adversarial examples over the embedding space\nof NLP as learning pairs. Using contrastive learning improves the\ngeneralization ability of adversarial training because contrastive loss can\nuniform the sample distribution. And at the same time, adversarial training\nalso enhances the robustness of contrastive learning. Two novel frameworks,\nsupervised contrastive adversarial learning (SCAL) and unsupervised SCAL\n(USCAL), are proposed, which yields learning pairs by utilizing the adversarial\ntraining for contrastive learning. The label-based loss of supervised tasks is\nexploited to generate adversarial examples while unsupervised tasks bring\ncontrastive loss. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we\nemploy it to Transformer-based models for natural language understanding,\nsentence semantic textual similarity and adversarial learning tasks.\nExperimental results on GLUE benchmark tasks show that our fine-tuned\nsupervised method outperforms BERT$_{base}$ over 1.75\\%.

Recently,\nself-supervised methods express great prospects in this task by merging the\ndisentangled representations for self-reconstruction.

In\nthis paper, we propose a Self-supervised Correlation Mining Network (SCM-Net)\nto rearrange the source images in the feature space, in which two collaborative\nmodules are integrated, Decomposed Style Encoder (DSE) and Correlation Mining\nModule (CMM). Specifically, the DSE first creates unaligned pairs at the\nfeature level. Then, the CMM establishes the spatial correlation field for\nfeature rearrangement. Eventually, a translation module transforms the\nrearranged features to realistic results.

To this end, we\npropose a physics-infused deep neural network based on the Blaschke products\nfor phase retrieval.

We compare\nthe BPNN to conventional deep neural networks (NNs) on several phase retrieval\nproblems, comprising both synthetic and contemporary real-world problems (e.g.,\nmetamaterials for which data collection requires substantial expertise and is\ntime consuming). On each phase retrieval problem, we compare against a\npopulation of conventional NNs of varying size and hyperparameter settings.\nEven without any hyper-parameter search, we find that BPNNs consistently\noutperform the population of optimized NNs in scarce data scenarios, and do so\ndespite being much smaller models.

They\nminimize the cost of non-linear alignments between series. CDTW and WDTW have\nbeen introduced because DTW is too permissive in its alignments. However, CDTW\nuses a crude step function, allowing unconstrained flexibility within the\nwindow, and none beyond it. WDTW's multiplicative weight is relative to the\ndistances between aligned points along a warped path, rather than being a\ndirect function of the amount of warping that is introduced. In this paper, we\nintroduce Amerced Dynamic Time Warping (ADTW), a new, intuitive, DTW variant\nthat penalizes the act of warping by a fixed additive cost. Like CDTW and WDTW,\nADTW constrains the amount of warping. However, it avoids both abrupt\ndiscontinuities in the amount of warping allowed and the limitations of a\nmultiplicative penalty. We formally introduce ADTW, prove some of its\nproperties, and discuss its parameterization.

To address these\nchallenges, many recent attempts have been made to repair DNNs for version\nupdates under practical operational contexts by updating weights (i.e., network\nparameters) through retraining, fine-tuning, or direct weight fixing at a\nneural level. In this work, as the first attempt, we initiate to repair DNNs by\njointly optimizing the architecture and weights at a higher (i.e., block)\nlevel.\nWe first perform empirical studies to investigate the limitation of whole\nnetwork-level and layer-level repairing, which motivates us to explore a novel\nrepairing direction for DNN repair at the block level. To this end, we first\npropose adversarial-aware spectrum analysis for vulnerable block localization\nthat considers the neurons' status and weights' gradients in blocks during the\nforward and backward processes, which enables more accurate candidate block\nlocalization for repairing even under a few examples. Then, we further propose\nthe architecture-oriented search-based repairing that relaxes the targeted\nblock to a continuous repairing search space at higher deep feature levels. By\njointly optimizing the architecture and weights in that space, we can identify\na much better block architecture. We implement our proposed repairing\ntechniques as a tool, named ArchRepair, and conduct extensive experiments to\nvalidate the proposed method. The results show that our method can not only\nrepair but also enhance accuracy & robustness, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art DNN repair techniques.",

We argue that the degree of\nregularization depends on the quality of data fed to the DNN, namely\nData-Driven Regularization. These findings are validated in several NNs, using\nGaussian synthetic data and real data sets (MNIST and CIFAR10). Finally, we\npropose a spectral criterion and construct an early stopping procedure when the\nNN is found highly regularized without test data by using the connection\nbetween the spectra types and the degrees of regularization. Such early stopped\nDNNs avoid unnecessary extra training while preserving a much comparable\ngeneralization ability.",

Recent researches attempt to reduce this cost by\noptimizing the backbone architecture with the help of Neural Architecture\nSearch (NAS). However, existing NAS methods for object detection require\nhundreds to thousands of GPU hours of searching, making them impractical in\nfast-paced research and development.

Under the hood, ZenDet maximizes the\ndifferential entropy of detection backbones, leading to a better feature\nextractor for object detection under the same computational budgets. After\nmerely one GPU day of fully automatic design, ZenDet innovates SOTA detection\nbackbones on multiple detection benchmark datasets with little human\nintervention. Comparing to ResNet-50 backbone, ZenDet is +2.0% better in mAP\nwhen using the same amount of FLOPs/parameters and is 1.54 times faster on\nNVIDIA V100 at the same mAP.

Additionally, we employ an additional\nobjective which aims to maximize the probability of observing human\nprotein-protein interactions. This additional task objective acts as a\nregularizer and also allows to incorporate domain knowledge to inform the\nvirus-human protein-protein interaction prediction model.\nOur approach achieved competitive results on 13 benchmark datasets and the\ncase study for the SAR-CoV-2 virus receptor.

    "abstract": "Recently, table structure recognition has achieved impressive progress with\nthe help of deep graph models. Most of them exploit single visual cues of\ntabular elements or simply combine visual cues with other modalities via early\nfusion to reason their graph relationships. However, neither early fusion nor\nindividually reasoning in terms of multiple modalities can be appropriate for\nall varieties of table structures with great diversity. Instead, different\nmodalities are expected to collaborate with each other in different patterns\nfor different table cases. In the community, the importance of intra-inter\nmodality interactions for table structure reasoning is still unexplored. In\nthis paper, we define it as heterogeneous table structure recognition\n(Hetero-TSR) problem. With the aim of filling this gap, we present a novel\nNeural Collaborative Graph Machines (NCGM) equipped with stacked collaborative\nblocks, which alternatively extracts intra-modality context and models\ninter-modality interactions in a hierarchical way. It can represent the\nintra-inter modality relationships of tabular elements more robustly, which\nsignificantly improves the recognition performance. We also show that the\nproposed NCGM can modulate collaborative pattern of different modalities\nconditioned on the context of intra-modality cues, which is vital for\ndiversified table cases.

    "abstract": "Multimodal data provide complementary information of a natural phenomenon by\nintegrating data from various domains with very different statistical\nproperties. Capturing the intra-modality and cross-modality information of\nmultimodal data is the essential capability of multimodal learning methods. The\ngeometry-aware data analysis approaches provide these capabilities by\nimplicitly representing data in various modalities based on their geometric\nunderlying structures. Also, in many applications, data are explicitly defined\non an intrinsic geometric structure. Generalizing deep learning methods to the\nnon-Euclidean domains is an emerging research field, which has recently been\ninvestigated in many studies. Most of those popular methods are developed for\nunimodal data. In this paper, a multimodal multi-scaled graph wavelet\nconvolutional network (M-GWCN) is proposed as an end-to-end network. M-GWCN\nsimultaneously finds intra-modality representation by applying the multiscale\ngraph wavelet transform to provide helpful localization properties in the graph\ndomain of each modality, and cross-modality representation by learning\npermutations that encode correlations among various modalities. M-GWCN is not\nlimited to either the homogeneous modalities with the same number of data, or\nany prior knowledge indicating correspondences between modalities. Several\nsemi-supervised node classification experiments have been conducted on three\npopular unimodal explicit graph-based datasets and five multimodal implicit\nones.

Black-box methods to generate saliency maps are particularly\ninteresting due to the fact that they do not utilize the internals of the model\nto explain the decision. Most black-box methods perturb the input and observe\nthe changes in the output. We formulate saliency map generation as a sequential\nsearch problem and leverage upon Reinforcement Learning (RL) to accumulate\nevidence from input images that most strongly support decisions made by a\nclassifier. Such a strategy encourages to search intelligently for the\nperturbations that will lead to high-quality explanations. While successful\nblack box explanation approaches need to rely on heavy computations and suffer\nfrom small sample approximation, the deterministic policy learned by our method\nmakes it a lot more efficient during the inference. Experiments on three\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in\ninference time over state-of-the-arts without hurting the performance.

    "title": "Modeling Human Preference and Stochastic Error for Medical Image  Segmentation with Multiple Annotators",
    "abstract": "Manual annotation of medical images is highly subjective, leading to\ninevitable and huge annotation biases. Deep learning models may surpass human\nperformance on a variety of tasks, but they may also mimic or amplify these\nbiases. Although we can have multiple annotators and fuse their annotations to\nreduce stochastic errors, we cannot use this strategy to handle the bias caused\nby annotators' preferences. In this paper, we highlight the issue of\nannotator-related biases on medical image segmentation tasks, and propose a\nPreference-involved Annotation Distribution Learning (PADL) framework to\naddress it from the perspective of disentangling an annotator's preference from\nstochastic errors using distribution learning so as to produce not only a meta\nsegmentation but also the segmentation possibly made by each annotator. Under\nthis framework, a stochastic error modeling (SEM) module estimates the meta\nsegmentation map and average stochastic error map, and a series of human\npreference modeling (HPM) modules estimate each annotator's segmentation and\nthe corresponding stochastic error. We evaluated our PADL framework on two\nmedical image benchmarks with different imaging modalities, which have been\nannotated by multiple medical professionals, and achieved promising performance\non all five medical image segmentation tasks.",

    "abstract": "Relative attribute (RA), referring to the preference over two images on the\nstrength of a specific attribute, can enable fine-grained image-to-image\ntranslation due to its rich semantic information. Existing work based on RAs\nhowever failed to reconcile the goal for fine-grained translation and the goal\nfor high-quality generation. We propose a new model TRIP to coordinate these\ntwo goals for high-quality fine-grained translation. In particular, we\nsimultaneously train two modules: a generator that translates an input image to\nthe desired image with smooth subtle changes with respect to the interested\nattributes; and a ranker that ranks rival preferences consisting of the input\nimage and the desired image. Rival preferences refer to the adversarial ranking\nprocess: (1) the ranker thinks no difference between the desired image and the\ninput image in terms of the desired attributes; (2) the generator fools the\nranker to believe that the desired image changes the attributes over the input\nimage as desired. RAs over pairs of real images are introduced to guide the\nranker to rank image pairs regarding the interested attributes only. With an\neffective ranker, the generator would \"win\" the adversarial game by producing\nhigh-quality images that present desired changes over the attributes compared\nto the input image. The experiments on two face image datasets and one shoe\nimage dataset demonstrate that our TRIP achieves state-of-art results in\ngenerating high-fidelity images which exhibit smooth changes over the\ninterested attributes.",

    "abstract": "In order to achieve the full potential of the Internet-of-Things,\nconnectivity between devices should be ubiquitous and efficient. Wireless mesh\nnetworks are a critical component to achieve this ubiquitous connectivity for a\nwide range of services, and are composed of terminal devices (i.e., nodes),\nsuch as sensors of various types, and wall powered gateway devices, which\nprovide further internet connectivity (e..g, via WiFi). When considering large\nindoor areas, such as hospitals or industrial scenarios, the mesh must cover a\nlarge area, which introduces concerns regarding range and the number of\ngateways needed and respective wall cabling infrastructure. Solutions for mesh\nnetworks implemented over different wireless protocols exist, like the recent\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.1. Besides range concerns, choosing which nodes\nforward data through the mesh has a large impact on performance and power\nconsumption. We address the area coverage issue via a battery powered BLE relay\ndevice of our own design, which acts as a range extender by forwarding packets\nfrom end nodes to gateways. We present the relay's design and experimentally\ndetermine the packet forwarding efficiency for several scenarios and\nconfigurations. In the best case, up to 35% of the packets transmitted by 11\nnodes can be forwarded to a gateway by a single relay under continuous\noperation.

    "abstract": "Confounders in deep learning are in general detrimental to model's\ngeneralization where they infiltrate feature representations. Therefore,\nlearning causal features that are free of interference from confounders is\nimportant. Most previous causal learning based approaches employ back-door\ncriterion to mitigate the adverse effect of certain specific confounder, which\nrequire the explicit identification of confounder. However, in real scenarios,\nconfounders are typically diverse and difficult to be identified. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Confounder Identification-free Causal Visual Feature\nLearning (CICF) method, which obviates the need for identifying confounders.\nCICF models the interventions among different samples based on front-door\ncriterion, and then approximates the global-scope intervening effect upon the\ninstance-level interventions from the perspective of optimization. In this way,\nwe aim to find a reliable optimization direction, which avoids the intervening\neffects of confounders, to learn causal features. Furthermore, we uncover the\nrelation between CICF and the popular meta-learning strategy MAML, and provide\nan interpretation of why MAML works from the theoretical perspective of causal\nlearning for the first time. Thanks to the effective learning of causal\nfeatures, our CICF enables models to have superior generalization capability.\nExtensive experiments on domain generalization benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our CICF, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",

We investigate jointly active beamforming at the AP\nand passive phase shifting at the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for\nsuccessfully delivering the control signals from the AP to the actuators within\na required time duration. The transmission follows a two-stage design. In the\nfirst stage, each actuator can both receive the direct signal from AP and the\nreflected signal from the RIS. In the second stage, the actuators with\nsuccessful reception in the first stage, relay the message through the D2D\nnetwork to the actuators with failed receptions. We formulate a non-convex\noptimization problem where we first obtain an equivalent but more tractable\nform by addressing the problem with discrete indicator functions.

    "abstract": "Inconsistency in prediction problems occurs when instances that relate in a\ncertain way on condition attributes, do not follow the same relation on the\ndecision attribute. For example, in ordinal classification with monotonicity\nconstraints, it occurs when an instance dominating another instance on\ncondition attributes has been assigned to a worse decision class. It typically\nappears as a result of perturbation in data caused by incomplete knowledge\n(missing attributes) or by random effects that occur during data generation\n(instability in the assessment of decision attribute values). Inconsistencies\nwith respect to a crisp preorder relation (expressing either dominance or\nindiscernibility between instances) can be handled using symbolic approaches\nlike rough set theory and by using statistical/machine learning approaches that\ninvolve optimization methods. Fuzzy rough sets can also be seen as a symbolic\napproach to inconsistency handling with respect to a fuzzy relation. In this\narticle, we introduce a new machine learning method for inconsistency handling\nwith respect to a fuzzy preorder relation.

    "abstract": "Permeability has a dominant influence on the flow properties of a natural\nfluid. Lattice Boltzmann simulator determines permeability from the nano and\nmicropore network. The simulator holds millions of flow dynamics calculations\nwith its accumulated errors and high consumption of computing power. To\nefficiently and consistently predict permeability, we propose a morphology\ndecoder, a parallel and serial flow reconstruction of machine learning\nsegmented heterogeneous Cretaceous texture from 3D micro computerized\ntomography and nuclear magnetic resonance images. For 3D vision, we introduce\ncontrollable-measurable-volume as new supervised segmentation, in which a\nunique set of voxel intensity corresponds to grain and pore throat sizes. The\nmorphology decoder demarks and aggregates the morphologies boundaries in a\nnovel way to produce permeability. Morphology decoder method consists of five\nnovel processes, which describes in this paper, these novel processes are: (1)\nGeometrical 3D Permeability, (2) Machine Learning guided 3D Properties\nRecognition of Rock Morphology, (3) 3D Image Properties Integration Model for\nPermeability, (4) MRI Permeability Imager, and (5) Morphology Decoder (the\nprocess that integrates the other four novel processes).",

    "abstract": "A key distinguishing feature of conversational recommender systems over\ntraditional recommender systems is their ability to elicit user preferences\nusing natural language. Currently, the predominant approach to preference\nelicitation is to ask questions directly about items or item attributes. These\nstrategies do not perform well in cases where the user does not have sufficient\nknowledge of the target domain to answer such questions. Conversely, in a\nshopping setting, talking about the planned use of items does not present any\ndifficulties, even for those that are new to a domain. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach to preference elicitation by asking implicit questions\nbased on item usage. Our approach consists of two main steps. First, we\nidentify the sentences from a large review corpus that contain information\nabout item usage. Then, we generate implicit preference elicitation questions\nfrom those sentences using a neural text-to-text model. The main contributions\nof this work also include a multi-stage data annotation protocol using\ncrowdsourcing for collecting high-quality labeled training data for the neural\nmodel. We show that our approach is effective in selecting review sentences and\ntransforming them to elicitation questions, even with limited training data.\nAdditionally, we provide an analysis of patterns where the model does not\nperform optimally.",

    "abstract": "Content creators often use music to enhance their stories, as it can be a\npowerful tool to convey emotion. In this paper, our goal is to help creators\nfind music to match the emotion of their story. We focus on text-based stories\nthat can be auralized (e.g., books), use multiple sentences as input queries,\nand automatically retrieve matching music. We formalize this task as a\ncross-modal text-to-music retrieval problem. Both the music and text domains\nhave existing datasets with emotion labels, but mismatched emotion vocabularies\nprevent us from using mood or emotion annotations directly for matching. To\naddress this challenge, we propose and investigate several emotion embedding\nspaces, both manually defined (e.g., valence/arousal) and data-driven (e.g.,\nWord2Vec and metric learning) to bridge this gap. Our experiments show that by\nleveraging these embedding spaces, we are able to successfully bridge the gap\nbetween modalities to facilitate cross modal retrieval. We show that our method\ncan leverage the well established valence-arousal space, but that it can also\nachieve our goal via data-driven embedding spaces. By leveraging data-driven\nembeddings, our approach has the potential of being generalized to other\nretrieval tasks that require broader or completely different vocabularies.",

    "abstract": "Attention modules for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an effective\nmethod to enhance performance of networks on multiple computer-vision tasks.\nWhile many works focus on building more effective modules through appropriate\nmodelling of channel-, spatial- and self-attention, they primarily operate in a\nfeedfoward manner. Consequently, the attention mechanism strongly depends on\nthe representational capacity of a single input feature activation, and can\nbenefit from incorporation of semantically richer higher-level activations that\ncan specify \"what and where to look\" through top-down information flow. Such\nfeedback connections are also prevalent in the primate visual cortex and\nrecognized by neuroscientists as a key component in primate visual attention.\nAccordingly, in this work, we propose a lightweight top-down (TD) attention\nmodule that iteratively generates a \"visual searchlight\" to perform top-down\nchannel and spatial modulation of its inputs and consequently outputs more\nselective feature activations at each computation step. Our experiments\nindicate that integrating TD in CNNs enhances their performance on ImageNet-1k\nclassification and outperforms prominent attention modules while being more\nparameter and memory efficient. Further, our models are more robust to changes\nin input resolution during inference and learn to \"shift attention\" by\nlocalizing individual objects or features at each computation step without any\nexplicit supervision. This capability results in 5% improvement for ResNet50 on\nweakly-supervised object localization besides improvements in fine-grained and\nmulti-label classification.",

    "abstract": "Face recognition systems have to deal with large variabilities (such as\ndifferent poses, illuminations, and expressions) that might lead to incorrect\nmatching decisions. These variabilities can be measured in terms of face image\nquality which is defined over the utility of a sample for recognition. Previous\nworks on face recognition either do not employ this valuable information or\nmake use of non-inherently fit quality estimates. In this work, we propose a\nsimple and effective face recognition solution (QMagFace) that combines a\nquality-aware comparison score with a recognition model based on a\nmagnitude-aware angular margin loss. The proposed approach includes\nmodel-specific face image qualities in the comparison process to enhance the\nrecognition performance under unconstrained circumstances. Exploiting the\nlinearity between the qualities and their comparison scores induced by the\nutilized loss, our quality-aware comparison function is simple and highly\ngeneralizable. The experiments conducted on several face recognition databases\nand benchmarks demonstrate that the introduced quality-awareness leads to\nconsistent improvements in the recognition performance. Moreover, the proposed\nQMagFace approach performs especially well under challenging circumstances,\nsuch as cross-pose, cross-age, or cross-quality. Consequently, it leads to\nstate-of-the-art performances on several face recognition benchmarks, such as\n98.50% on AgeDB, 83.97% on XQLFQ, and 98.74% on CFP-FP.

In this\npreconditioner, near-field blocks are scaled to a diagonal block matrix and\nthese near-field blocks are replaced with the scaled diagonal block matrix\nwhich reduces the near-field storage memory and the overall matrix vector\nproduct time. Scaled diagonal block matrix is further used as a preconditioner\nand due to the block diagonal form of the final preconditioner, no additional\nfill-ins are introduced in its inverse. The symmetric property of the\nnear-field blocks is exploited to reduce the preconditioner setup time. Near\nlinear complexity of preconditioner set up and solve times is achieved by\nnear-field block ordering, using graph bandwidth reduction algorithms and\ncompressing the fill-in blocks in preconditioner computation. Preconditioner\nset up time is reduced to half by using the symmetric property and near-field\nblock ordering. It has been shown using a complexity analysis that the cost of\npreconditioner construction in terms of computation and memory is linear.\nNumerical experiments demonstrate an average of 1.5-2.3x speed-up in the\niterative solution time over Null-Field based preconditioners.",

A popular\nparadigm for this problem setting is learning with a designed auxiliary dense\nreward function, namely proxy reward, instead of sparse environmental signals.\nBased on this framework, this paper proposes a novel reward redistribution\nalgorithm, randomized return decomposition (RRD), to learn a proxy reward\nfunction for episodic reinforcement learning. We establish a surrogate problem\nby Monte-Carlo sampling that scales up least-squares-based reward\nredistribution to long-horizon problems.

    "abstract": "Popular cryptocurrencies continue to face serious scalability issues due to\ntheir ever-growing blockchains. Thus, modern blockchain designs began to prune\nold blocks and rely on recent snapshots for their bootstrapping processes\ninstead. Unfortunately, established systems are often considered incapable of\nadopting these improvements. In this work, we present CoinPrune, our\nblock-pruning scheme with full Bitcoin compatibility, to revise this popular\nbelief. CoinPrune bootstraps joining nodes via snapshots that are periodically\ncreated from Bitcoin's set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXO set). Our\nscheme establishes trust in these snapshots by relying on CoinPrune-supporting\nminers to mutually reaffirm a snapshot's correctness on the blockchain. This\nway, snapshots remain trustworthy even if adversaries attempt to tamper with\nthem. Our scheme maintains its retrospective deployability by relying on\npositive feedback only, i.e., blocks containing invalid reaffirmations are not\nrejected, but invalid reaffirmations are outpaced by the benign ones created by\nan honest majority among CoinPrune-supporting miners. Already today, CoinPrune\nreduces the storage requirements for Bitcoin nodes by two orders of magnitude,\nas joining nodes need to fetch and process only 6 GiB instead of 271 GiB of\ndata in our evaluation, reducing the synchronization time of powerful devices\nfrom currently 7 h to 51 min, with even larger potential drops for less\npowerful devices. CoinPrune is further aware of higher-level application data,\ni.e., it conserves otherwise pruned application data and allows nodes to\nobfuscate objectionable and potentially illegal blockchain content from their\nUTXO set and the snapshots they distribute.",

This paper considers an edge\ncomputing system where the server and workers have possibly different computing\nand communication capabilities and employ quantization before transmitting\nmessages. To explore the full potential of FL in such an edge computing system,\nwe first present a general FL algorithm, namely GenQSGD, parameterized by the\nnumbers of global and local iterations, mini-batch size, and step size\nsequence. Then, we analyze its convergence for an arbitrary step size sequence\nand specify the convergence results under three commonly adopted step size\nrules, namely the constant, exponential, and diminishing step size rules. Next,\nwe optimize the algorithm parameters to minimize the energy cost under the time\nconstraint and convergence error constraint, with the focus on the overall\nimplementing process of FL. Specifically, for any given step size sequence\nunder each considered step size rule, we optimize the numbers of global and\nlocal iterations and mini-batch size to optimally implement FL for applications\nwith preset step size sequences. We also optimize the step size sequence along\nwith these algorithm parameters to explore the full potential of FL. The\nresulting optimization problems are challenging non-convex problems with\nnon-differentiable constraint functions. We propose iterative algorithms to\nobtain KKT points using general inner approximation (GIA) and tricks for\nsolving complementary geometric programming (CGP).

The size of a\nrecognizing automaton for the set of synchronizing words is linked to\ncomputational problems related to synchronization and to the length of\nsynchronizing words. Hence, it is natural to investigate synchronizing automata\nextremal with this property, i.e., such that the minimal deterministic\nautomaton for the set of synchronizing words has $2^n - n$ states. The\nsync-maximal permutation groups have been introduced in [{\\sc S.

However, these same features\ncontributed to the emergence of borderline activities and, as is common with\nOnline Social Networks, the heavy presence of fake accounts. Telegram started\nto address these issues by introducing the verified and scam marks for the\nchannels. Unfortunately, the problem is far from being solved. In this work, we\nperform a large-scale analysis of Telegram by collecting 35,382 different\nchannels and over 130,000,000 messages. We study the channels that Telegram\nmarks as verified or scam, highlighting analogies and differences. Then, we\nmove to the unmarked channels.

The main families of RNN are\nconsidered, namely Neural Nonlinear AutoRegressive eXogenous, (NNARX), Echo\nState Networks (ESN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units\n(GRU). The goal is twofold. Firstly, to survey recent results concerning the\ntraining of RNN that enjoy Input-to-State Stability (ISS) and Incremental\nInput-to-State Stability ({\\delta}ISS) guarantees. Secondly, to discuss the\nissues that still hinder the widespread use of RNN for control, namely their\nrobustness, verifiability, and interpretability. The former properties are\nrelated to the so-called generalization capabilities of the networks, i.e.\ntheir consistency with the underlying real plants, even in presence of unseen\nor perturbed input trajectories. The latter is instead related to the\npossibility of providing a clear formal connection between the RNN model and\nthe plant. In this context, we illustrate how ISS and {\\delta}ISS represent a\nsignificant step towards the robustness and verifiability of the RNN models,\nwhile the requirement of interpretability paves the way to the use of\nphysics-based networks. The design of model predictive controllers with RNN as\nplant's model is also briefly discussed. Lastly, some of the main topics of the\npaper are illustrated on a simulated chemical system.",

    "abstract": "The Asian giant hornet (AGH) appeared in Washington State appears to have a\npotential danger of bioinvasion. Washington State has collected public photos\nand videos of detected insects for verification and further investigation. In\nthis paper, we analyze AGH using data analysis,statistics, discrete\nmathematics, and deep learning techniques to process the data to controlAGH\nspreading.First, we visualize the geographical distribution of insects in\nWashington State. Then we investigate insect populations to varying months of\nthe year and different days of a month.Third, we employ wavelet analysis to\nexamine the periodic spread of AGH. Fourth, we apply ordinary differential\nequations to examine AGH numbers at the different natural growthrate and\nreaction speed and output the potential propagation coefficient. Next, we\nleverage cellular automaton combined with the potential propagation coefficient\nto simulate the geographical spread under changing potential propagation. To\nupdate the model, we use delayed differential equations to simulate human\nintervention. We use the time difference between detection time and submission\ntime to determine the unit of time to delay time. After that, we construct a\nlightweight CNN called SqueezeNet and assess its classification performance. We\nthen relate several non-reference image quality metrics, including NIQE, image\ngradient, entropy, contrast, and TOPSIS to judge the cause of\nmisclassification. Furthermore, we build a Random Forest classifier to identify\npositive and negative samples based on image qualities only. We also display\nthe feature importance and conduct an error analysis. Besides, we present\nsensitivity analysis to verify the robustness of our models. Finally, we show\nthe strengths and weaknesses of our model and derives the conclusions.",

Previous studies on JRS suggest\nthat taking such views into account in the design of the JRS can lead to\nimproved model performance. Also, it may lead to a more uniform distribution of\ncandidates over a set of similar jobs. We also consider the literature from the\nperspective of algorithm fairness.

With respect to the\ntype of models used in JRS, authors frequently label their method as `hybrid'.\nUnfortunately, they thereby obscure what these methods entail. Using existing\nrecommender taxonomies, we split this large class of hybrids into subcategories\nthat are easier to analyse. We further find that data availability, and in\nparticular the availability of click data, has a large impact on the choice of\nmethod and validation.

    "abstract": "Vision transformers have delivered tremendous success in representation\nlearning. This is primarily due to effective token mixing through self\nattention. However, this scales quadratically with the number of pixels, which\nbecomes infeasible for high-resolution inputs. To cope with this challenge, we\npropose Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (AFNO) as an efficient token mixer\nthat learns to mix in the Fourier domain. AFNO is based on a principled\nfoundation of operator learning which allows us to frame token mixing as a\ncontinuous global convolution without any dependence on the input resolution.\nThis principle was previously used to design FNO, which solves global\nconvolution efficiently in the Fourier domain and has shown promise in learning\nchallenging PDEs. To handle challenges in visual representation learning such\nas discontinuities in images and high resolution inputs, we propose principled\narchitectural modifications to FNO which results in memory and computational\nefficiency. This includes imposing a block-diagonal structure on the channel\nmixing weights, adaptively sharing weights across tokens, and sparsifying the\nfrequency modes via soft-thresholding and shrinkage. The resulting model is\nhighly parallel with a quasi-linear complexity and has linear memory in the\nsequence size. AFNO outperforms self-attention mechanisms for few-shot\nsegmentation in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. For Cityscapes\nsegmentation with the Segformer-B3 backbone, AFNO can handle a sequence size of\n65k and outperforms other efficient self-attention mechanisms.",

Moreover, the intrusion\ndetection task faces a serious challenge associated with the extreme class\nimbalance between normal and malicious traffics. Recently, graph-neural network\n(GNN) achieved state-of-the-art performance to model the network topology in\ncybersecurity tasks.

Reported experimental responses of a\ndetailed test database consisting of 384 reinforced concrete shear walls under\ncyclic loading were utilized to predict seven critical points to define the\nbackbone curves, namely: shear at cracking point; shear and displacement at\nyielding point; and peak shear force and corresponding displacement; and\nultimate displacement and corresponding shear.

The ability of the proposed GPR-based model\nto make accurate and robust estimations for the backbone curves was validated\nbased on unseen data using a hundred random sampling procedure. The prediction\naccuracies (i.e., ratio of predicted/actual values) are close to 1.0, whereas\nthe coefficient of determination (R2) values range between 0.90-0.97 for all\nbackbone points.

Through\ntheir short trading horizon and continuous nature, the intraday markets offer\nthe ability to adjust trading decisions from the day-ahead market or reduce\ntrading risk in a short-term notice. Producers of renewable energies utilize\nthe intraday market to lower their forecast risk, by modifying their provided\ncapacities based on current forecasts. However, the market dynamics are complex\ndue to the fact that the power grids have to remain stable and electricity is\nonly partly storable. Consequently, robust and intelligent trading strategies\nare required that are capable to operate in the intraday market. In this work,\nwe propose a novel autonomous trading approach based on Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL) algorithms as a possible solution. For this purpose, we model\nthe intraday trade as a Markov Decision Problem (MDP) and employ the Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO) algorithm as our DRL approach. A simulation framework\nis introduced that enables the trading of the continuous intraday price in a\nresolution of one minute steps. We test our framework in a case study from the\nperspective of a wind park operator. We include next to general trade\ninformation both price and wind forecasts. On a test scenario of German\nintraday trading results from 2018, we are able to outperform multiple\nbaselines with at least 45.24% improvement, showing the advantage of the DRL\nalgorithm.

To this end, we systematically compare GANs trained with\nthe two best-known DP frameworks for deep learning, DP-SGD, and PATE, in\ndifferent data imbalance settings from two perspectives -- the size of the\nclasses in the generated synthetic data and their classification performance.\nOur analyses show that applying PATE, similarly to DP-SGD, has a disparate\neffect on the under/over-represented classes but in a much milder magnitude\nmaking it more robust. Interestingly, our experiments consistently show that\nfor PATE, unlike DP-SGD, the privacy-utility trade-off is not monotonically\ndecreasing but is much smoother and inverted U-shaped, meaning that adding a\nsmall degree of privacy actually helps generalization.

Solving this problem has important implications on several\nInformation Retrieval applications, including Web search, conversational IR,\nmachine translation, question answering, recommender systems, etc. Our goal is\nto solve the problem by minimizing the number of times we probe the adjacency\nmatrix, i.e., the number of matches played. We prove that any\ndeterministic/randomized algorithm finding a champion with constant success\nprobability requires $\\Omega(\\ell n)$ comparisons, where $\\ell$ is the number\nof matches lost by the champion. We then present an optimal deterministic\nalgorithm matching this lower bound without knowing $\\ell$ and we extend our\nanalysis to three strictly related problems. Lastly, we conduct a comprehensive\nexperimental assessment of the proposed algorithms to speed up a\nstate-of-the-art solution for ranking on public data. Results show that our\nproposals speed up the retrieval of the champion up to $13\\times$ in this\nscenario.",

There are two significant problems with\nthis approach: (i) by contrasting representations at the image-level, it is\nhard to generate detailed object-sensitive features that are beneficial to\ndownstream object-level tasks such as instance segmentation; (ii) the\naugmentation strategy of producing an augmented counterpart is fixed, making\nlearning less effective at the later stages of pre-training. In this work, we\nintroduce Curricular Contrastive Object-level Pre-training (CCOP) to tackle\nthese problems: (i) we use selective search to find rough object regions and\nuse them to build an inter-image object-level contrastive loss and an\nintra-image object-level discrimination loss into our pre-training objective;\n(ii) we present a curriculum learning mechanism that adaptively augments the\ngenerated regions, which allows the model to consistently acquire a useful\nlearning signal, even in the later stages of pre-training.

However, this is hampered by the\nabsence of a reasonable size dataset. One of the most challenging aspects is\nthe reluctance of the experts to annotate the dataset at low magnification on\nlow-cost microscopes. We present a dataset to further the research on malaria\nmicroscopy over the low-cost microscopes at low magnification. Our large-scale\ndataset consists of images of blood-smear slides from several malaria-infected\npatients, collected through microscopes at two different cost spectrums and\nmultiple magnifications. Malarial cells are annotated for the localization and\nlife-stage classification task on the images collected through the high-cost\nmicroscope at high magnification. We design a mechanism to transfer these\nannotations from the high-cost microscope at high magnification to the low-cost\nmicroscope, at multiple magnifications. Multiple object detectors and domain\nadaptation methods are presented as the baselines.

We reveal that premature tracklet termination is the main\ncause of identity switches in modern 3DMOT systems. To address this, we propose\nImmortal Tracker, a simple tracking system that utilizes trajectory prediction\nto maintain tracklets for objects gone dark. We employ a simple Kalman filter\nfor trajectory prediction and preserve the tracklet by prediction when the\ntarget is not visible. With this method, we can avoid 96% vehicle identity\nswitches resulting from premature tracklet termination. Without any learned\nparameters, our method achieves a mismatch ratio at the 0.0001 level and\ncompetitive MOTA for the vehicle class on the Waymo Open Dataset test set.

    "title": "Self-supervised Pretraining with Classification Labels for Temporal  Activity Detection",
    "abstract": "Temporal Activity Detection aims to predict activity classes per frame, in\ncontrast to video-level predictions as done in Activity Classification (i.e.,\nActivity Recognition). Due to the expensive frame-level annotations required\nfor detection, the scale of detection datasets is limited. Thus, commonly,\nprevious work on temporal activity detection resorts to fine-tuning a\nclassification model pretrained on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,\nKinetics-400). However, such pretrained models are not ideal for downstream\ndetection performance due to the disparity between the pretraining and the\ndownstream fine-tuning tasks. This work proposes a novel self-supervised\npretraining method for detection leveraging classification labels to mitigate\nsuch disparity by introducing frame-level pseudo labels, multi-action frames,\nand action segments. We show that the models pretrained with the proposed\nself-supervised detection task outperform prior work on multiple challenging\nactivity detection benchmarks, including Charades and MultiTHUMOS. Our\nextensive ablations further provide insights on when and how to use the\nproposed models for activity detection. Code and models will be released\nonline.",

    "abstract": "Modeling visual data as tokens (i.e., image patches), and applying attention\nmechanisms or feed-forward networks on top of them has shown to be highly\neffective in recent years. The common pipeline in such approaches includes a\ntokenization method, followed by a set of layers/blocks for information mixing,\nboth within tokens and among tokens. In common practice, image patches are\nflattened when converted into tokens, discarding the spatial structure within\neach patch. Next, a module such as multi-head self-attention captures the\npairwise relations among the tokens and mixes them. In this paper, we argue\nthat models can have significant gains when spatial structure is preserved in\ntokenization, and is explicitly used in the mixing stage. We propose two key\ncontributions: (1) Structure-aware Tokenization and, (2) Structure-aware\nMixing, both of which can be combined with existing models with minimal effort.\nWe introduce a family of models (SWAT), showing improvements over the likes of\nDeiT, MLP-Mixer and Swin Transformer, across multiple benchmarks including\nImageNet classification and ADE20K segmentation.

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a technique for high quality novel view\nsynthesis from a collection of posed input images. Like most view synthesis\nmethods, NeRF uses tonemapped low dynamic range (LDR) as input; these images\nhave been processed by a lossy camera pipeline that smooths detail, clips\nhighlights, and distorts the simple noise distribution of raw sensor data. We\nmodify NeRF to instead train directly on linear raw images, preserving the\nscene's full dynamic range. By rendering raw output images from the resulting\nNeRF, we can perform novel high dynamic range (HDR) view synthesis tasks. In\naddition to changing the camera viewpoint, we can manipulate focus, exposure,\nand tonemapping after the fact. Although a single raw image appears\nsignificantly more noisy than a postprocessed one, we show that NeRF is highly\nrobust to the zero-mean distribution of raw noise. When optimized over many\nnoisy raw inputs (25-200), NeRF produces a scene representation so accurate\nthat its rendered novel views outperform dedicated single and multi-image deep\nraw denoisers run on the same wide baseline input images. As a result, our\nmethod, which we call RawNeRF, can reconstruct scenes from extremely noisy\nimages captured in near-darkness.",

    "abstract": "Learning-based optical flow estimation has been dominated with the pipeline\nof cost volume with convolutions for flow regression, which is inherently\nlimited to local correlations and thus is hard to address the long-standing\nchallenge of large displacements. To alleviate this, the state-of-the-art\nmethod, i.e., RAFT, gradually improves the quality of its predictions by\nproducing a sequence of flow updates via a large number of iterative\nrefinements, achieving remarkable performance but slowing down the inference\nspeed. To enable both high accuracy and efficiency optical flow estimation, we\ncompletely revamp the dominating flow regression pipeline by reformulating\noptical flow as a global matching problem. Specifically, we propose a GMFlow\nframework, which consists of three main components: a customized Transformer\nfor feature enhancement, a correlation and softmax layer for global feature\nmatching, and a self-attention layer for flow propagation. Moreover, we further\nintroduce a refinement step that reuses GMFlow at higher-resolutions for\nresidual flow prediction. Our new framework outperforms 32-iteration RAFT's\nperformance on the challenging Sintel benchmark, while using only one\nrefinement and running faster, offering new possibilities for efficient and\naccurate optical flow estimation.

It displays how a\nstructure, or a concept, projects from each category to the other, and back.\nAdjunctions are the common denominator of Galois connections, representation\ntheories, spectra, and generalized quantifiers. We call an adjunction nuclear\nwhen its categories determine each other. We show that every adjunction can be\nresolved into a nuclear adjunction. This resolution is idempotent in a strong\nsense. The nucleus of an adjunction displays its conceptual core, just as the\nsingular value decomposition of an adjoint pair of linear operators displays\ntheir canonical bases.\nThe two composites of an adjoint pair of functors induce a monad and a\ncomonad. Monads and comonads generalize the closure and the interior operators\nfrom topology, or modalities from logic, while providing a saturated view of\nalgebraic structures and compositions on one side, and of coalgebraic dynamics\nand decompositions on the other. They are resolved back into adjunctions over\nthe induced categories of algebras and of coalgebras. The nucleus of an\nadjunction is an adjunction between the induced categories of algebras and\ncoalgebras. It provides new presentations for both, revealing the meaning of\nconstructing algebras for a comonad and coalgebras for a monad.\nIn his seminal early work, Ross Street described an adjunction between monads\nand comonads in 2-categories. Lifting the nucleus construction, we show that\nthe resulting Street monad on monads is strongly idempotent, and extracts the\nnucleus of a monad. A dual treatment achieves the same for comonads. Applying a\nnotable fragment of pure 2-category theory on an acute practical problem of\ndata analysis thus led to new theoretical result.",

However, the computer-generated\nholograms (CGHs) used for such applications are typically generated by\niterative algorithms, which demand high computation effort, limiting advanced\napplications like in vivo optogenetic stimulation and fiber-optic cell\nmanipulation. The random and discrete distribution of the fiber cores induces\nstrong spatial aliasing to the CGHs, hence, an approach that can rapidly\ngenerate tailored CGHs for MCFs is highly demanded. We demonstrate a novel\nphase encoder deep neural network (CoreNet), which can generate accurate\ntailored CGHs for MCFs at a near video-rate. Simulations show that CoreNet can\nspeed up the computation time by two magnitudes and increase the fidelity of\nthe generated light field compared to the conventional CGH techniques. For the\nfirst time, real-time generated tailored CGHs are on-the-fly loaded to the\nphase-only SLM for dynamic light fields generation through the MCF\nmicroendoscope in experiments. This paves the avenue for real-time cell\nrotation and several further applications that require real-time high-fidelity\nlight delivery in biomedicine.",

We\ntherefore introduce group interactions among receivers, and study how their\ninterconnectedness in higher-order social networks affects the evolution of\nlying.

We find conditions for honesty to\npersist even when there is a temptation to lie, and we observe the prevalence\nof moral strategy profiles even when lies favor the receiver at a cost to the\nsender. We confirm the robustness of our results by further performing\nsimulations on hypergraphs created from real-world data using the SocioPatterns\ndatabase.

In this research, the time-frequency relationship between the first\nharmonic of the acoustic signal and the moment of characteristic frequency\napplied is established through the digital lock-in and low-pass filtering\ntechniques.

Investigating the triangular book graph B_m^((3)), we first find the\nirregularity strength of triangular book graph s(B_m^((3)) ), as the lower\nbound for the modular irregularity strength, and then construct a modular\nirregular s(B_m^((3)) )-labeling. The result shows that triangular book graphs\nadmit a modular irregular labeling and its modular irregularity strength and\nirregularity strength are equal, except for a small case and the infinity\nproperty.",

    "abstract": "The centrality in a network is a popular metric for agents' network positions\nand is often used in regression models to model the network effect on an\noutcome variable of interest. In empirical studies, researchers often adopt a\ntwo-stage procedure to first estimate the centrality and then infer the network\neffect using the estimated centrality. Despite its prevalent adoption, this\ntwo-stage procedure lacks theoretical backing and can fail in both estimation\nand inference. We, therefore, propose a unified framework, under which we prove\nthe shortcomings of the two-stage in centrality estimation and the undesirable\nconsequences in the regression. We then propose a novel supervised network\ncentrality estimation (SuperCENT) methodology that simultaneously yields\nsuperior estimations of the centrality and the network effect and provides\nvalid and narrower confidence intervals than those from the two-stage.

Absolute gain favors large entities, while relative gain\nfavors small ones. To accommodate both absolute and relative gain in an\nunbiased way, we define Pareto ordering between entities.

We show how to compute momentum leaders and propose linear\nordering among them to help rank entities with the most momentum on the top.\nAdditionally, we show that when vectors follow power-law, the cardinality of\nthe set of Momentum leaders (Pareto frontier) is of the order of square root of\nthe logarithm of the number of entities, thus it is very small.",

A natural extension is when partial\ninformation is given: the two assignments are known to coincide on a given\nsubset of taxa. The partial information setting is biologically relevant as the\nlocation of some taxa (species) in the phylogenetic tree may be known, and for\nother taxa it might not be known. What can we then say about the average and\nmaximum quartet distance in this more general setting?

    "abstract": "An efficient implicit representation of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ in a family\n$\\mathcal{F}$ of graphs assigns to each vertex of $G$ a binary code of length\n$O(\\log n)$ so that the adjacency between every pair of vertices can be\ndetermined only as a function of their codes. This function can depend on the\nfamily but not on the individual graph. Every family of graphs admitting such a\nrepresentation contains at most $2^{O(n\\log(n))}$ graphs on $n$ vertices, and\nthus has at most factorial speed of growth.\nThe Implicit Graph Conjecture states that, conversely, every hereditary graph\nfamily with at most factorial speed of growth admits an efficient implicit\nrepresentation. We refute this conjecture by establishing the existence of\nhereditary graph families with factorial speed of growth that require codes of\nlength $n^{\\Omega(1)}$.",

    "abstract": "Current models on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) have shown an\nevident and quantified lack of reliability for measuring feature-relevance when\nstatistically entangled features are proposed for training deep classifiers.\nThere has been an increase in the application of Deep Learning in clinical\ntrials to predict early diagnosis of neuro-developmental disorders, such as\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, the inclusion of more reliable\nsaliency-maps to obtain more trustworthy and interpretable metrics using neural\nactivity features is still insufficiently mature for practical applications in\ndiagnostics or clinical trials. Moreover, in ASD research the inclusion of deep\nclassifiers that use neural measures to predict viewed facial emotions is\nrelatively unexplored. Therefore, in this study we propose the evaluation of a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for electroencephalography (EEG)-based\nfacial emotion recognition decoding complemented with a novel\nRemOve-And-Retrain (ROAR) methodology to recover highly relevant features used\nin the classifier. Specifically, we compare well-known relevance maps such as\nLayer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), PatternNet, Pattern Attribution, and\nSmooth-Grad Squared.

However, training such\nvariational quantum algorithms suffers from gradient vanishing as the size of\nthe algorithm increases. Previous work cannot handle the gradient vanishing\ninduced by the inevitable noise effects on realistic quantum hardware. In this\npaper, we propose a novel training scheme to mitigate such noise-induced\ngradient vanishing. We first introduce a new cost function of which the\ngradients are significantly augmented by employing traceless observables in\ntruncated subspace. We then prove that the same minimum can be reached by\noptimizing the original cost function with the gradients from the new cost\nfunction.

Fortification games have applications in\nvarious important areas, such as military operations, design of survivable\nnetworks, protection of facilities, or power grid protection. In this work, we\npresent an exact solution algorithm for FGs, in which the recourse problems\ncorrespond to (possibly NP-hard) combinatorial optimization problems.

    "abstract": "Many different studies have suggested that episodic memory is a generative\nprocess, but most computational models adopt a storage view. In this work, we\npropose a computational model for generative episodic memory. It is based on\nthe central hypothesis that the hippocampus stores and retrieves selected\naspects of an episode as a memory trace, which is necessarily incomplete. At\nrecall, the neocortex reasonably fills in the missing information based on\ngeneral semantic information in a process we call semantic completion.\nAs episodes we use images of digits (MNIST) augmented by different\nbackgrounds representing context. Our model is based on a VQ-VAE which\ngenerates a compressed latent representation in form of an index matrix, which\nstill has some spatial resolution. We assume that attention selects some part\nof the index matrix while others are discarded, this then represents the gist\nof the episode and is stored as a memory trace. At recall the missing parts are\nfilled in by a PixelCNN, modeling semantic completion, and the completed index\nmatrix is then decoded into a full image by the VQ-VAE.\nThe model is able to complete missing parts of a memory trace in a\nsemantically plausible way up to the point where it can generate plausible\nimages from scratch. Due to the combinatorics in the index matrix, the model\ngeneralizes well to images not trained on. Compression as well as semantic\ncompletion contribute to a strong reduction in memory requirements and\nrobustness to noise. Finally we also model an episodic memory experiment and\ncan reproduce that semantically congruent contexts are always recalled better\nthan incongruent ones, high attention levels improve memory accuracy in both\ncases, and contexts that are not remembered correctly are more often remembered\nsemantically congruently than completely wrong.",

Complex black-box\nmodels are typically used for decision making to achieve high accuracy;\nhowever, as important as high accuracy, it is essential for engineers to\nunderstand how the model makes the decision and verify that the model is\nphysically meaningful. With this motivation, this study proposes a glass-box\n(interpretable) classification model to predict the seismic failure mode of\nconventional reinforced concrete shear (structural) walls. Reported\nexperimental damage information of 176 conventional shear walls tested under\nreverse cyclic loading were designated as class-types, whereas key design\nproperties (e.g. compressive strength of concrete, axial load ratio, and web\nreinforcement ratio) of shear walls were used as the basic classification\nfeatures. The trade-off between model complexity and model interpretability was\ndiscussed using eight Machine Learning (ML) methods. The results showed that\nthe Decision Tree method was a more convenient classifier with higher\ninterpretability with a high classification accuracy than its counterparts.\nAlso, to enhance the practicality of the model, a feature reduction was\nconducted to reduce the complexity of the proposed classifier with higher\nclassification performance, and the most relevant features were identified,\nnamely: compressive strength of concrete, wall aspect ratio, transverse\nboundary, and web reinforcement ratio. The ability of the final DT model to\npredict the failure modes was validated with a classification rate of around\n90%. The proposed model aims to provide engineers interpretable, robust, and\nrapid prediction in seismic performance assessment.",

    "abstract": "Estimating porosity models via seismic data is challenging due to the signal\nnoise and insufficient resolution of seismic data. Although impedance inversion\nis often used by combining with well logs, several hurdles remain to retrieve\nsub-seismic scale porosity. As an alternative, we propose a machine\nlearning-based workflow to convert seismic data to porosity models. A ResUNet++\nbased workflow is designed to take three seismic data in different frequencies\n(i.e., decomposed seismic data) and estimate their corresponding porosity\nmodel. The workflow is successfully demonstrated in the 3D channelized\nreservoir to estimate the porosity model with more than 0.9 in R2 score for\ntraining and validating data. Moreover, the application is extended for a\nstress test by adding signal noise to the seismic data, and the workflow\nresults show a robust estimation even with 5\\% of noise. Another two ResUNet++\nare trained to take either the lowest or highest resolution seismic data only\nto estimate the porosity model, but they show under- and over-fitting results,\nsupporting the importance of using decomposed seismic data in porosity\nestimation.",

    "title": "Nonequilibrium Monte Carlo for unfreezing variables in hard  combinatorial optimization",
    "abstract": "Optimizing highly complex cost/energy functions over discrete variables is at\nthe heart of many open problems across different scientific disciplines and\nindustries. A major obstacle is the emergence of many-body effects among\ncertain subsets of variables in hard instances leading to critical slowing down\nor collective freezing for known stochastic local search strategies. An\nexponential computational effort is generally required to unfreeze such\nvariables and explore other unseen regions of the configuration space. Here, we\nintroduce a quantum-inspired family of nonlocal Nonequilibrium Monte Carlo\n(NMC) algorithms by developing an adaptive gradient-free strategy that can\nefficiently learn key instance-wise geometrical features of the cost function.\nThat information is employed on-the-fly to construct spatially inhomogeneous\nthermal fluctuations for collectively unfreezing variables at various length\nscales, circumventing costly exploration versus exploitation trade-offs. We\napply our algorithm to two of the most challenging combinatorial optimization\nproblems: random k-satisfiability (k-SAT) near the computational phase\ntransitions and Quadratic Assignment Problems (QAP). We observe significant\nspeedup and robustness over both specialized deterministic solvers and generic\nstochastic solvers. In particular, for 90% of random 4-SAT instances we find\nsolutions that are inaccessible for the best specialized deterministic\nalgorithm known as Survey Propagation (SP) with an order of magnitude\nimprovement in the quality of solutions for the hardest 10% instances. We also\ndemonstrate two orders of magnitude improvement in time-to-solution over the\nstate-of-the-art generic stochastic solver known as Adaptive Parallel Tempering\n(APT).",

The two main concerns are generalization to unseen data with\na different visual appearance, e.g., images acquired using a different scanner,\nand efficiency in terms of computation time and required Graphics Processing\nUnit (GPU) memory. In this work, we employ a multi-organ segmentation model\nbased on the SpatialConfiguration-Net (SCN), which integrates prior knowledge\nof the spatial configuration among the labelled organs to resolve spurious\nresponses in the network outputs.
