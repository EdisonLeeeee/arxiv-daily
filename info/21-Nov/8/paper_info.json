    "abstract": "Sea subsurface temperature, an essential component of aquatic wildlife,\nunderwater dynamics and heat transfer with the sea surface, is affected by\nglobal warming in climate change. Existing research is commonly based on either\nphysics-based numerical models or data based models. Physical modeling and\nmachine learning are traditionally considered as two unrelated fields for the\nsea subsurface temperature prediction task, with very different scientific\nparadigms (physics-driven and data-driven). However, we believe both methods\nare complementary to each other. Physical modeling methods can offer the\npotential for extrapolation beyond observational conditions, while data-driven\nmethods are flexible in adapting to data and are capable of detecting\nunexpected patterns. The combination of both approaches is very attractive and\noffers potential performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework based on generative adversarial network (GAN) combined with numerical\nmodel to predict sea subsurface temperature. First, a GAN-based model is used\nto learn the simplified physics between the surface temperature and the target\nsubsurface temperature in numerical model. Then, observation data are used to\ncalibrate the GAN-based model parameters to obtain better prediction. We\nevaluate the proposed framework by predicting daily sea subsurface temperature\nin the South China sea. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "We present a holistic design for GPU-accelerated computation in TrustZone\nTEE. Without pulling the complex GPU software stack into the TEE, we follow a\nsimple approach: record the CPU/GPU interactions ahead of time, and replay the\ninteractions in the TEE at run time. This paper addresses the approach's key\nmissing piece -- the recording environment, which needs both strong security\nand access to diverse mobile GPUs. To this end, we present a novel architecture\ncalled CODY, in which a mobile device (which possesses the GPU hardware) and a\ntrustworthy cloud service (which runs the GPU software) exercise the GPU\nhardware/software in a collaborative, distributed fashion. To overcome numerous\nnetwork round trips and long delays, CODY contributes optimizations specific to\nmobile GPUs: register access deferral, speculation, and metastate-only\nsynchronization. With these optimizations, recording a compute workload takes\nonly tens of seconds, which is up to 95% less than a naive approach; replay\nincurs 25% lower delays compared to insecure, native execution.",

Current approaches for learning tool\nmanipulation skills mostly rely on expert demonstrations provided in the target\nrobot environment, for example, by manually guiding the robot manipulator or by\nteleoperation. In this work, we introduce an automated approach that replaces\nan expert demonstration with a Youtube video for learning a tool manipulation\nstrategy. The main contributions are twofold. First, we design an alignment\nprocedure that aligns the simulated environment with the real-world scene\nobserved in the video. This is formulated as an optimization problem that finds\na spatial alignment of the tool trajectory to maximize the sparse goal reward\ngiven by the environment. Second, we describe an imitation learning approach\nthat focuses on the trajectory of the tool rather than the motion of the human.\nFor this we combine reinforcement learning with an optimization procedure to\nfind a control policy and the placement of the robot based on the tool motion\nin the aligned environment. We demonstrate the proposed approach on spade,\nscythe and hammer tools in simulation, and show the effectiveness of the\ntrained policy for the spade on a real Franka Emika Panda robot demonstration.",

Most of the existing works\neither predict one of these 3D properties or focus on solving both for a single\nobject. One fundamental challenge lies in how to learn an effective\nrepresentation of the image that is well-suited for 3D detection and\nreconstruction. In this work, we propose to learn a regular grid of 3D voxel\nfeatures from the input image which is aligned with 3D scene space via a 3D\nfeature lifting operator. Based on the 3D voxel features, our novel\nCenterNet-3D detection head formulates the 3D detection as keypoint detection\nin the 3D space. Moreover, we devise an efficient coarse-to-fine reconstruction\nmodule, including coarse-level voxelization and a novel local PCA-SDF shape\nrepresentation, which enables fine detail reconstruction and one order of\nmagnitude faster inference than prior methods. With complementary supervision\nfrom both 3D detection and reconstruction, one enables the 3D voxel features to\nbe geometry and context preserving, benefiting both tasks.The effectiveness of\nour approach is demonstrated through 3D detection and reconstruction in single\nobject and multiple object scenarios.",

We show that RNN and transformer language models exhibit\nstructured, consistent generalization in out-of-distribution contexts. We begin\nby introducing two idealized models of generalization in next-word prediction:\na local context model in which generalization is consistent with the last word\nobserved, and a global context model in which generalization is consistent with\nthe global structure of the input. In experiments in English, Finnish,\nMandarin, and random regular languages, we demonstrate that neural language\nmodels interpolate between these two forms of generalization: their predictions\nare well-approximated by a log-linear combination of local and global\npredictive distributions. We then show that, in some languages, noise mediates\nthe two forms of generalization: noise applied to input tokens encourages\nglobal generalization, while noise in history representations encourages local\ngeneralization. Finally, we offer a preliminary theoretical explanation of\nthese results by proving that the observed interpolation behavior is expected\nin log-linear models with a particular feature correlation structure. These\nresults help explain the effectiveness of two popular regularization schemes\nand show that aspects of sequence model generalization can be understood and\ncontrolled.",

The\nunification of the arm with the drone poses challenges in the modeling and\ncontrol of such a combined platform; these challenges are addressed with this\nwork. We propose a unified model for the flying manipulator based on three\nmodeling principles: the Piecewise Constant Curvature (PCC) and Augmented Rigid\nBody Model (ARBM) hypotheses for modeling soft continuum robots and a\nfloating-base approach borrowed from the traditional rigid-body robotics\nliterature. To demonstrate the validity and usefulness of this parametrisation,\na hierarchical model-based feedback controller is implemented.

    "abstract": "The problem of aggregating expert forecasts is ubiquitous in fields as\nwide-ranging as machine learning, economics, climate science, and national\nsecurity. Despite this, our theoretical understanding of this question is\nfairly shallow. This paper initiates the study of forecast aggregation in a\ncontext where experts' knowledge is chosen adversarially from a broad class of\ninformation structures. While in full generality it is impossible to achieve a\nnontrivial performance guarantee, we show that doing so is possible under a\ncondition on the experts' information structure that we call \\emph{projective\nsubstitutes}. The projective substitutes condition is a notion of informational\nsubstitutes: that there are diminishing marginal returns to learning the\nexperts' signals. We show that under the projective substitutes condition,\ntaking the average of the experts' forecasts improves substantially upon the\nstrategy of trusting a random expert. We then consider a more permissive\nsetting, in which the aggregator has access to the prior. We show that by\naveraging the experts' forecasts and then \\emph{extremizing} the average by\nmoving it away from the prior by a constant factor, the aggregator's\nperformance guarantee is substantially better than is possible without\nknowledge of the prior. Our results give a theoretical grounding to past\nempirical research on extremization and help give guidance on the appropriate\namount to extremize.",

By injecting malicious code in one library, an attacker\nmay compromise all instances of all applications that depend on the library. To\nmitigate the impact of supply chain attacks, we propose the concept of Library\nSubstitution Framework. This novel concept leverages one key observation: when\nan application depends on a library, it is very likely that there exists other\nlibraries that provide similar features. The key objective of Library\nSubstitution Framework is to enable the developers of an application to harness\nthis diversity of libraries in their supply chain. The framework lets them\ngenerate a population of application variants, each depending on a different\nalternative library that provides similar functionalities. To investigate the\nrelevance of this concept, we develop ARGO, a proof-of-concept implementation\nof this framework that harnesses the diversity of JSON suppliers. We study the\nfeasibility of library substitution and its impact on a set of 368 clients. Our\nempirical results show that for 195 of the 368 java applications tested, we can\nsubstitute the original JSON library used by the client by at least 15 other\nJSON libraries without modifying the client's code.

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have recently found applications in\nimage editing. However, most GAN based image editing methods often require\nlarge scale datasets with semantic segmentation annotations for training, only\nprovide high level control, or merely interpolate between different images.\nHere, we propose EditGAN, a novel method for high quality, high precision\nsemantic image editing, allowing users to edit images by modifying their highly\ndetailed part segmentation masks, e.g., drawing a new mask for the headlight of\na car. EditGAN builds on a GAN framework that jointly models images and their\nsemantic segmentations, requiring only a handful of labeled examples, making it\na scalable tool for editing. Specifically, we embed an image into the GAN\nlatent space and perform conditional latent code optimization according to the\nsegmentation edit, which effectively also modifies the image. To amortize\noptimization, we find editing vectors in latent space that realize the edits.\nThe framework allows us to learn an arbitrary number of editing vectors, which\ncan then be directly applied on other images at interactive rates. We\nexperimentally show that EditGAN can manipulate images with an unprecedented\nlevel of detail and freedom, while preserving full image quality.We can also\neasily combine multiple edits and perform plausible edits beyond EditGAN\ntraining data. We demonstrate EditGAN on a wide variety of image types and\nquantitatively outperform several previous editing methods on standard editing\nbenchmark tasks.",

Our study has two phases. In the first phase, we pick five\nSE-specific sentiment detection tools from two recently published papers by Lin\net al.

We find that the\nexisting tools can be complementary to each other in 85-95% of the cases, i.e.,\none is wrong, but another is right. However, a majority voting-based ensemble\nof those tools fails to improve the accuracy of sentiment detection.

Sentisead improves the performance (F1-score) of the individual\ntools by 4% (over Senti4SD [5]) - 100% (over POME [31]).

    "abstract": "Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to detect objects with similar\npatterns (e.g., texture, intensity, colour, etc) to their surroundings, and\nrecently has attracted growing research interest. As camouflaged objects often\npresent very ambiguous boundaries, how to determine object locations as well as\ntheir weak boundaries is challenging and also the key to this task. Inspired by\nthe biological visual perception process when a human observer discovers\ncamouflaged objects, this paper proposes a novel edge-based reversible\nre-calibration network called ERRNet. Our model is characterized by two\ninnovative designs, namely Selective Edge Aggregation (SEA) and Reversible\nRe-calibration Unit (RRU), which aim to model the visual perception behaviour\nand achieve effective edge prior and cross-comparison between potential\ncamouflaged regions and background. More importantly, RRU incorporates diverse\npriors with more comprehensive information comparing to existing COD models.\nExperimental results show that ERRNet outperforms existing cutting-edge\nbaselines on three COD datasets and five medical image segmentation datasets.\nEspecially, compared with the existing top-1 model SINet, ERRNet significantly\nimproves the performance by $\\sim$6% (mean E-measure) with notably high speed\n(79.3 FPS), showing that ERRNet could be a general and robust solution for the\nCOD task.",

    "abstract": "Graph classification has applications in bioinformatics, social sciences,\nautomated fake news detection, web document classification, and more. In many\npractical scenarios, including web-scale applications, where labels are scarce\nor hard to obtain, unsupervised learning is a natural paradigm but it trades\noff performance. Recently, contrastive learning (CL) has enabled unsupervised\ncomputer vision models to compete well against supervised ones. Theoretical and\nempirical works analyzing visual CL frameworks find that leveraging large\ndatasets and domain aware augmentations is essential for framework success.\nInterestingly, graph CL frameworks often report high performance while using\norders of magnitude smaller data, and employing domain-agnostic augmentations\n(e.g., node or edge dropping, feature perturbations) that can corrupt the\ngraphs' underlying properties.\nMotivated by these discrepancies, we seek to determine: (i) why existing\ngraph CL frameworks perform well despite weak augmentations and limited data;\nand (ii) whether adhering to visual CL principles can improve performance on\ngraph classification tasks. Through extensive analysis, we identify flawed\npractices in graph data augmentation and evaluation protocols that are commonly\nused in the graph CL literature, and propose improved practices and sanity\nchecks for future research and applications. We show that on small benchmark\ndatasets, the inductive bias of graph neural networks can significantly\ncompensate for the limitations of existing frameworks. In case studies with\nrelatively larger graph classification tasks, we find that commonly used\ndomain-agnostic augmentations perform poorly, while adhering to principles in\nvisual CL can significantly improve performance. For example, in graph-based\ndocument classification, which can be used for better web search, we show\ntask-relevant augmentations improve accuracy by 20%.",

A tactile\nsensor is introduced to measure tissue hardness in the specific laryngeal\nregion by gentle contact. The kernel fusion method is proposed to combine the\nSquared Exponential (SE) kernel with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) kernel to figure\nout the drawbacks that the existing kernel functions are not sufficiently\noptimal in this scenario. Moreover, we further regularize exploration factor\nand greed factor, and the tactile sensor's moving distance and the robotic base\nlink's rotation angle during the incision localization process are considered\nas new factors in the acquisition strategy. We conducted simulation and\nphysical experiments to compare the newly proposed algorithm - Rescaling\nAcquisition Strategy with Energy Constraints (RASEC) in trachea detection with\ncurrent palpation-based acquisition strategies. The result indicates that the\nproposed acquisition strategy with fusion kernel can successfully localize the\nincision with the highest algorithm performance (Average Precision 0.932,\nAverage Recall 0.973, Average F1 score 0.952). During the robotic palpation\nprocess, the cumulative moving distance is reduced by 50%, and the cumulative\nrotation angle is reduced by 71.4% with no sacrifice in the comprehensive\nperformance capabilities.

In the proposed network, we leverage CQF (i.e., one\nof the most efficient TSN mechanisms) in the access networks which aggregates\nthe traffic from end-devices. Meanwhile, in the core network, we exploit the\nDIP (i.e., a well-known deterministic networking mechanism for backbone\nnetworks) for long-distance deterministic transmission. We design the cycle\nalignment mechanism to enable seamless and deterministic transmission among\nhierarchical networks. A joint schedule is also formulated, which introduces\nthe traffic shaping at the network edge to maximize the network throughput.\nExperimental simulations show that the proposed network can achieve end-to-end\ndeterministic transmission, even in the highly-load scenarios.",

However, infinitesimally close to stationarity, entropy contraction\nbecomes equivalent to variance contraction, a.k.a. a Poincare inequality, which\nis significantly easier to establish through, e.g., spectral analysis.\nMotivated by this observation, we study restricted modified log-Sobolev\ninequalities that guarantee entropy contraction not for all starting\ndistributions, but for those in a large neighborhood of the stationary\ndistribution. We show how to sample from the hardcore and Ising models on\n$n$-node graphs that have a constant $\\delta$ relative gap to the\ntree-uniqueness threshold, in nearly-linear time $\\widetilde O_{\\delta}(n)$.\nNotably, our bound does not depend on the maximum degree $\\Delta$, and is\ntherefore optimal even for high-degree graphs. This improves on prior mixing\ntime bounds of $\\widetilde O_{\\delta, \\Delta}(n)$ and $\\widetilde\nO_{\\delta}(n^2)$, established via (non-restricted) modified log-Sobolev and\nPoincare inequalities respectively.

In\nthis work, we present a novel context-aware transformer transducer (CATT)\nnetwork that improves the state-of-the-art transformer-based ASR system by\ntaking advantage of such contextual signals. Specifically, we propose a\nmulti-head attention-based context-biasing network, which is jointly trained\nwith the rest of the ASR sub-networks. We explore different techniques to\nencode contextual data and to create the final attention context vectors. We\nalso leverage both BLSTM and pretrained BERT based models to encode contextual\ndata and guide the network training. Using an in-house far-field dataset, we\nshow that CATT, using a BERT based context encoder, improves the word error\nrate of the baseline transformer transducer and outperforms an existing deep\ncontextual model by 24.2% and 19.4% respectively.",

    "abstract": "For the past two decades, there have been significant efforts to develop\nmethods for object detection in Remote Sensing (RS) images. In most cases, the\ndatasets for small object detection in remote sensing images are inadequate.\nMany researchers used scene classification datasets for object detection, which\nhas its limitations; for example, the large-sized objects outnumber the small\nobjects in object categories. Thus, they lack diversity; this further affects\nthe detection performance of small object detectors in RS images. This paper\nreviews current datasets and object detection methods (deep learning-based) for\nremote sensing images. We also propose a large-scale, publicly available\nbenchmark Remote Sensing Super-resolution Object Detection (RSSOD) dataset. The\nRSSOD dataset consists of 1,759 hand-annotated images with 22,091 instances of\nvery high resolution (VHR) images with a spatial resolution of ~0.05 m. There\nare five classes with varying frequencies of labels per class. The image\npatches are extracted from satellite images, including real image distortions\nsuch as tangential scale distortion and skew distortion. We also propose a\nnovel Multi-class Cyclic super-resolution Generative adversarial network with\nResidual feature aggregation (MCGR) and auxiliary YOLOv5 detector to benchmark\nimage super-resolution-based object detection and compare with the existing\nstate-of-the-art methods based on image super-resolution (SR). The proposed\nMCGR achieved state-of-the-art performance for image SR with an improvement of\n1.2dB PSNR compared to the current state-of-the-art NLSN method. MCGR achieved\nbest object detection mAPs of 0.758, 0.881, 0.841, and 0.983, respectively, for\nfive-class, four-class, two-class, and single classes, respectively surpassing\nthe performance of the state-of-the-art object detectors YOLOv5, EfficientDet,\nFaster RCNN, SSD, and RetinaNet.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most occurring neurological diseases. The main\ncharacteristic of this disease is a frequent seizure, which is an electrical\nimbalance in the brain. It is generally accompanied by shaking of body parts\nand even leads (fainting). In the past few years, many treatments have come up.\nThese mainly involve the use of anti-seizure drugs for controlling seizures.\nBut in 70% of cases, these drugs are not effective, and surgery is the only\nsolution when the condition worsens. So patients need to take care of\nthemselves while having a seizure and be safe. Wearable electroencephalogram\n(EEG) devices have come up with the development in medical science and\ntechnology. These devices help in the analysis of brain electrical activities.\nEEG helps in locating the affected cortical region. The most important is that\nit can predict any seizure in advance on-site. This has resulted in a sudden\nincrease in demand for effective and efficient seizure prediction and diagnosis\nsystems. A novel approach to epileptic seizure prediction and diagnosis system\nEpilNet is proposed in the present paper. It is a one-dimensional (1D)\nconvolution neural network. EpilNet gives the testing accuracy of 79.13% for\nfive classes, leading to a significant increase of about 6-7% compared to\nrelated works. The developed Web API helps in bringing EpilNet into practical\nuse. Thus, it is an integrated system for both patients and doctors.

    "abstract": "Dialogue summarization has been extensively studied and applied, where the\nprior works mainly focused on exploring superior model structures to align the\ninput dialogue and the output summary. However, for professional dialogues\n(e.g., legal debate and medical diagnosis), semantic/statistical alignment can\nhardly fill the logical/factual gap between input dialogue discourse and\nsummary output with external knowledge. In this paper, we mainly investigate\nthe factual inconsistency problem for Dialogue Inspectional Summarization (DIS)\nunder non-pretraining and pretraining settings. An innovative end-to-end\ndialogue summary generation framework is proposed with two auxiliary tasks:\nExpectant Factual Aspect Regularization (EFAR) and Missing Factual Entity\nDiscrimination (MFED). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nmodel can generate a more readable summary with accurate coverage of factual\naspects as well as informing the user with potential missing facts detected\nfrom the input dialogue for further human intervention.",

    "abstract": "Image segmentation in the urban scene has recently attracted much attention\ndue to its success in autonomous driving systems. However, the poor performance\nof concerned foreground targets, e.g., traffic lights and poles, still limits\nits further practical applications. In urban scenes, foreground targets are\nalways concealed in their surrounding stuff because of the special camera\nposition and 3D perspective projection. What's worse, it exacerbates the\nunbalance between foreground and background classes in high-level features due\nto the continuous expansion of the reception field. We call it Feature\nCamouflage. In this paper, we present a novel add-on module, named Feature\nBalance Network (FBNet), to eliminate the feature camouflage in urban-scene\nsegmentation. FBNet consists of two key components, i.e., Block-wise BCE(BwBCE)\nand Dual Feature Modulator(DFM). BwBCE serves as an auxiliary loss to ensure\nuniform gradients for foreground classes and their surroundings during\nbackpropagation. At the same time, DFM intends to enhance the deep\nrepresentation of foreground classes in high-level features adaptively under\nthe supervision of BwBCE. These two modules facilitate each other as a whole to\nease feature camouflage effectively. Our proposed method achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art segmentation performance on two challenging urban-scene\nbenchmarks, i.e., Cityscapes and BDD100K. Code will be released for\nreproduction.",

    "abstract": "Solid-State Drives (SSDs) have significant performance advantages over\ntraditional Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) such as lower latency and higher\nthroughput. Significantly higher price per capacity and limited lifetime,\nhowever, prevents designers to completely substitute HDDs by SSDs in enterprise\nstorage systems. SSD-based caching has recently been suggested for storage\nsystems to benefit from higher performance of SSDs while minimizing the overall\ncost. While conventional caching algorithms such as Least Recently Used (LRU)\nprovide high hit ratio in processors, due to the highly random behavior of\nInput/Output (I/O) workloads, they hardly provide the required performance\nlevel for storage systems. In addition to poor performance, inefficient\nalgorithms also shorten SSD lifetime with unnecessary cache replacements. Such\nshortcomings motivate us to benefit from more complex non-linear algorithms to\nachieve higher cache performance and extend SSD lifetime. In this paper, we\npropose RC-RNN, the first reconfigurable SSD-based cache architecture for\nstorage systems that utilizes machine learning to identify performance-critical\ndata pages for I/O caching. The proposed architecture uses Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNN) to characterize ongoing workloads and optimize itself towards\nhigher cache performance while improving SSD lifetime. RC-RNN attempts to learn\ncharacteristics of the running workload to predict its behavior and then uses\nthe collected information to identify performance-critical data pages to fetch\ninto the cache. Experimental results show that RC-RNN characterizes workloads\nwith an accuracy up to 94.6% for SNIA I/O workloads. RC-RNN can perform\nsimilarly to the optimal cache algorithm by an accuracy of 95% on average, and\noutperforms previous SSD caching architectures by providing up to 7x higher hit\nratio and decreasing cache replacements by up to 2x.",

An alternative to retain high\ndispatchable generation capacity is electric energy storage that enables\nutilization of surplus power, where the electric energy storage contributes to\nthe security of supply. Such systems can be considered as energy-constrained,\nand the operation of the electric energy storage must balance operating cost\nminimization and the risk of scarcity. In this matter, operation dependent\nstorage characteristics such as energy storage degradation are a complicating\nfactor. This paper proposes a linear approximation of battery state-of-charge\ndegradation and implements it in a stochastic dual dynamic programming based\nenergy-management model in combination with cycling degradation. The\nimplications of degradation modelling are studied for a small Norwegian\nmicrogrid with variable renewable power generation and limited dispatchable\ngeneration capacity as well as battery and hydrogen storage to balance supply\nand demand. Our results show that the proposed strategy can prolong the\nexpected battery lifetime by more than four years compared to the naive\nstochastic strategy but may cause increased degradation for other system\nresources.

Accurate action localization requires the utilization of\nboth temporal and spatial information. Recent attempts achieve this by using\ncomputationally intensive 3D CNN architectures or highly redundant two-stream\narchitectures with optical flow, making them both unsuitable for real-time,\nonline applications. To accomplish activity localization under highly\nchallenging real-time constraints, we propose utilizing fast and efficient\nkey-point based bounding box prediction to spatially localize actions. We then\nintroduce a tube-linking algorithm that maintains the continuity of action\ntubes temporally in the presence of occlusions. Further, we eliminate the need\nfor a two-stream architecture by combining temporal and spatial information\ninto a cascaded input to a single network, allowing the network to learn from\nboth types of information. Temporal information is efficiently extracted using\na structural similarity index map as opposed to computationally intensive\noptical flow.

The signal that represents the literal\nmeaning is often represented by (non-contextual) word embeddings. However,\nmetaphorical expressions evolve over time due to various reasons, such as\ncultural and societal impact. Metaphorical expressions are known to co-evolve\nwith language and literal word meanings, and even drive, to some extent, this\nevolution. This rises the question whether different, possibly time-specific,\nrepresentations of literal meanings may impact on the metaphor detection task.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which examines the\nmetaphor detection task with a detailed exploratory analysis where different\ntemporal and static word embeddings are used to account for different\nrepresentations of literal meanings. Our experimental analysis is based on\nthree popular benchmarks used for metaphor detection and word embeddings\nextracted from different corpora and temporally aligned to different\nstate-of-the-art approaches. The results suggest that different word embeddings\ndo impact on the metaphor detection task and some temporal word embeddings\nslightly outperform static methods on some performance measures. However,\nresults also suggest that temporal word embeddings may provide representations\nof words' core meaning even too close to their metaphorical meaning, thus\nconfusing the classifier. Overall, the interaction between temporal language\nevolution and metaphor detection appears tiny in the benchmark datasets used in\nour experiments. This suggests that future work for the computational analysis\nof this important linguistic phenomenon should first start by creating a new\ndataset where this interaction is better represented.",

    "abstract": "Conversational speech normally is embodied with loose syntactic structures at\nthe utterance level but simultaneously exhibits topical coherence relations\nacross consecutive utterances. Prior work has shown that capturing longer\ncontext information with a recurrent neural network or long short-term memory\nlanguage model (LM) may suffer from the recent bias while excluding the\nlong-range context. In order to capture the long-term semantic interactions\namong words and across utterances, we put forward disparate conversation\nhistory fusion methods for language modeling in automatic speech recognition\n(ASR) of conversational speech. Furthermore, a novel audio-fusion mechanism is\nintroduced, which manages to fuse and utilize the acoustic embeddings of a\ncurrent utterance and the semantic content of its corresponding conversation\nhistory in a cooperative way. To flesh out our ideas, we frame the ASR N-best\nhypothesis rescoring task as a prediction problem, leveraging BERT, an iconic\npre-trained LM, as the ingredient vehicle to facilitate selection of the oracle\nhypothesis from a given N-best hypothesis list. Empirical experiments conducted\non the AMI benchmark dataset seem to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy\nof our methods in relation to some current top-of-line methods.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel recommender systems dataset that records the sequential\ninteractions between users and an online marketplace. The users are\nsequentially presented with both recommendations and search results in the form\nof ranked lists of items, called slates, from the marketplace. The dataset\nincludes the presented slates at each round, whether the user clicked on any of\nthese items and which item the user clicked on. Although the usage of exposure\ndata in recommender systems is growing, to our knowledge there is no open\nlarge-scale recommender systems dataset that includes the slates of items\npresented to the users at each interaction. As a result, most articles on\nrecommender systems do not utilize this exposure information. Instead, the\nproposed models only depend on the user's click responses, and assume that the\nuser is exposed to all the items in the item universe at each step, often\ncalled uniform candidate sampling. This is an incomplete assumption, as it\ntakes into account items the user might not have been exposed to. This way\nitems might be incorrectly considered as not of interest to the user. Taking\ninto account the actually shown slates allows the models to use a more natural\nlikelihood, based on the click probability given the exposure set of items, as\nis prevalent in the bandit and reinforcement learning literature.\n\\cite{Eide2021DynamicSampling} shows that likelihoods based on uniform\ncandidate sampling (and similar assumptions) are implicitly assuming that the\nplatform only shows the most relevant items to the user. This causes the\nrecommender system to implicitly reinforce feedback loops and to be biased\ntowards previously exposed items to the user.",

    "abstract": "Verification of properties expressed as-regular languages such as LTL can\nbenefit hugely from stutter-insensitivity, using a diverse set of reduction\nstrategies. However properties that are not stutter-insensitive, for instance\ndue to the use of the neXt operator of LTL or to some form of counting in the\nlogic, are not covered by these techniques in general. We propose in this paper\nto study a weaker property than stutter-insensitivity. In a stutter insensitive\nlanguage both adding and removing stutter to a word does not change its\nacceptance, any stuttering can be abstracted away; by decomposing this\nequivalence relation into two implications we obtain weaker conditions. We\ndefine a shortening insensitive language where any word that stutters less than\na word in the language must also belong to the language. A lengthening\ninsensitive language has the dual property. A semi-decision procedure is then\nintroduced to reliably prove shortening insensitive properties or deny\nlengthening insensitive properties while working with a reduction of a system.\nA reduction has the property that it can only shorten runs. Lipton's\ntransaction reductions or Petri net agglomerations are examples of eligible\nstructural reduction strategies. An implementation and experimental evidence is\nprovided showing most nonrandom properties sensitive to stutter are actually\nshortening or lengthening insensitive. Performance of experiments on a large\n(random) benchmark from the model-checking competition indicate that despite\nbeing a semi-decision procedure, the approach can still improve state of the\nart verification tools.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating social relations into the recommendation system, i.e. social\nrecommendation, has been widely studied in academic and industrial communities.\nWhile many promising results have been achieved, existing methods mostly assume\nthat the social relations can be homogeneously applied to all the items, which\nis not practical for users' actually diverse preferences. In this paper, we\nargue that the effect of the social relations should be inhomogeneous, that is,\ntwo socially-related users may only share the same preference on some specific\nitems, while for the other products, their preferences can be inconsistent or\neven contradictory. Inspired by this idea, we build a novel social\nrecommendation model, where the traditional pair-wise \"user-user'' relation is\nextended to the triple relation of \"user-item-user''. To well handle such\nhigh-order relations, we base our framework on the hypergraph. More\nspecifically, each hyperedge connects a user-user-item triplet, representing\nthat the two users share similar preferences on the item. We develop a Social\nHyperGraph Convolutional Network (short for SHGCN) to learn from the complex\ntriplet social relations. With the hypergraph convolutional networks, the\nsocial relations can be modeled in a more fine-grained manner, which more\naccurately depicts real users' preferences, and benefits the recommendation\nperformance. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate our\nmodel's effectiveness. Studies on data sparsity and hyper-parameter studies\nfurther validate our model's rationality.

    "abstract": "Objectives. We generate via advanced Deep Learning (DL) techniques artificial\nleaf images in an automatized way. We aim to dispose of a source of training\nsamples for AI applications for modern crop management. Such applications\nrequire large amounts of data and, while leaf images are not truly scarce,\nimage collection and annotation remains a very time--consuming process. Data\nscarcity can be addressed by augmentation techniques consisting in simple\ntransformations of samples belonging to a small dataset, but the richness of\nthe augmented data is limited: this motivates the search for alternative\napproaches. Methods. Pursuing an approach based on DL generative models, we\npropose a Leaf-to-Leaf Translation (L2L) procedure structured in two steps:\nfirst, a residual variational autoencoder architecture generates synthetic leaf\nskeletons (leaf profile and veins) starting from companions binarized skeletons\nof real images. In a second step, we perform translation via a Pix2pix\nframework, which uses conditional generator adversarial networks to reproduce\nthe colorization of leaf blades, preserving the shape and the venation pattern.\nResults. The L2L procedure generates synthetic images of leaves with a\nrealistic appearance. We address the performance measurement both in a\nqualitative and a quantitative way; for this latter evaluation, we employ a DL\nanomaly detection strategy which quantifies the degree of anomaly of synthetic\nleaves with respect to real samples. Conclusions. Generative DL approaches have\nthe potential to be a new paradigm to provide low-cost meaningful synthetic\nsamples for computer-aided applications. The present L2L approach represents a\nstep towards this goal, being able to generate synthetic samples with a\nrelevant qualitative and quantitative resemblance to real leaves.",

    "abstract": "The traditional cloud-centric approach for Deep Learning (DL) requires\ntraining data to be collected and processed at a central server which is often\nchallenging in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare. Towards this, a new\nlearning paradigm called Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed that brings\nthe potential of DL to these domains while addressing privacy and data\nownership issues. FL enables remote clients to learn a shared ML model while\nkeeping the data local. However, conventional FL systems face several\nchallenges such as scalability, complex infrastructure management, and wasted\ncompute and incurred costs due to idle clients. These challenges of FL systems\nclosely align with the core problems that serverless computing and\nFunction-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms aim to solve. These include rapid\nscalability, no infrastructure management, automatic scaling to zero for idle\nclients, and a pay-per-use billing model. To this end, we present a novel\nsystem and framework for serverless FL, called FedLess. Our system supports\nmultiple commercial and self-hosted FaaS providers and can be deployed in the\ncloud, on-premise in institutional data centers, and on edge devices. To the\nbest of our knowledge, we are the first to enable FL across a large fabric of\nheterogeneous FaaS providers while providing important features like security\nand Differential Privacy. We demonstrate with comprehensive experiments that\nthe successful training of DNNs for different tasks across up to 200 client\nfunctions and more is easily possible using our system.

In this work, we apply meta-reinforcement\nlearning (meta-RL) formulation in the context of the ad hoc teamwork problem.\nOur empirical results show that such a method could produce robust cooperative\nagents in two cooperative environments with different cooperative\ncircumstances: social compliance and language interpretation.

    "abstract": "The increasing interconnection of industrial networks with the Internet\nexposes them to an ever-growing risk of cyberattacks. A well-proven mechanism\nto detect such attacks is industrial intrusion detection, which searches for\nanomalies in otherwise predictable communication or process behavior. However,\nefforts to improve these detection methods mostly focus on specific domains and\ncommunication protocols, leading to a research landscape that is broken up into\nisolated silos. Thus, existing approaches cannot be applied to other industrial\nscenarios that would equally benefit from powerful detection approaches. To\nbetter understand this issue, we survey 53 detection systems and conclude that\nthere is no fundamental reason for their narrow focus. Although they are often\ncoupled to specific industrial protocols in practice, many approaches could\ngeneralize to new industrial scenario in theory. To unlock this potential for\nintrusion detection across industrial domains and protocols, we propose IPAL,\nour industrial protocol abstraction layer, to decouple intrusion detection from\ndomain-specific industrial communication protocols. We show the practical\napplicability and correctness of IPAL through a reproducibility study in which\nwe re-implement eight detection approaches from related work on top of IPAL.\nFinally, we showcase the unique benefits of IPAL for industrial intrusion\ndetection research by studying the generalizability of existing approaches to\nnew datasets and conclude that they are indeed not restricted to specific\ndomains or protocols.",

Therefore, HSI has\nbeen successfully applied in various applications, including remote sensing for\nsecurity and defense, precision agriculture for vegetation and crop monitoring,\nfood/drink, and pharmaceuticals quality control.

However, generating\nREMs is a laborious undertaking, especially in complex 3-Dimensional (3D)\nenvironments, such as indoors. To address this issue, we propose a system for\nautonomous generation of fine-grained REMs of indoor 3D spaces. In the system,\nmultiple small indoor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are sequentially used for\n3D sampling of signal quality indicators. The collected readings are\nstreamlined to a Machine Learning (ML) system for its training and, once\ntrained, the system is able to predict the signal quality at unknown 3D\nlocations. The system enables automated and autonomous REM generation, and can\nbe straightforwardly deployed in new environments. In addition, the system\nsupports REM sampling without self-interference and is technology-agnostic, as\nlong as the REM-sampling receivers features suitable sizes and weights to be\ncarried by the UAVs. In the demonstration, we instantiate the system design\nusing two UAVs and show its capability of visiting 72 waypoints and gathering\nthousands of Wi-Fi data samples.

Dynamics of the flyer in\ncomplex flow is highly unsteady and nonlinear, which makes modeling the\ndynamics challenging. Thus, conventional control methodologies, where the\ndynamics is modeled, are insufficient for regulating such complicated dynamics.\nTherefore, in the present study, the integrated framework, in which the whole\ngoverning equations for fluid and structure are solved, is proposed to generate\na control policy for the flyer. For the deep-RL to successfully learn the\ncontrol policy, accurate and ample data of the dynamics are required. However,\nsatisfying both the quality and quantity of the data on the intricate dynamics\nis extremely difficult since, in general, more accurate data are more costly.\nIn the present study, two strategies are proposed to deal with the dilemma. To\nobtain accurate data, the CFD-CSD is adopted for precisely predicting the\ndynamics. To gain ample data, a novel data reproduction method is devised,\nwhere the obtained data are replicated for various situations while conserving\nthe dynamics. With those data, the framework learns the control policy in\nvarious flow conditions and the learned policy is shown to have remarkable\nperformance in controlling the flyer in complex flow fields.",

In this work, we identify and formally define a new type of\nproactive attentional attacks called Informational Denial-of-Service (IDoS)\nattacks that generate a large volume of feint attacks to overload human\noperators and hide real attacks among feints. We incorporate human factors\n(e.g., levels of expertise, stress, and efficiency) and empirical results\n(e.g., the Yerkes-Dodson law and the sunk cost fallacy) to model the operators'\nattention dynamics and their decision-making processes along with the real-time\nalert monitoring and inspection.\nTo assist human operators in timely and accurately dismissing the feints and\nescalating the real attacks, we develop a Resilient and Adaptive Data-driven\nalert and Attention Management Strategy (RADAMS) that de-emphasizes alerts\nselectively based on the alerts' observable features. RADAMS uses reinforcement\nlearning to achieve a customized and transferable design for various human\noperators and evolving IDoS attacks.\nThe integrated modeling and theoretical analysis lead to the Product\nPrinciple of Attention (PPoA), fundamental limits, and the tradeoff among\ncrucial human and economic factors. Experimental results corroborate that the\nproposed strategy outperforms the default strategy and can reduce the IDoS risk\nby as much as 20%.

On the other hand, the rising\nparadigm of knowledge graph (KG) provides us a promising solution to extract\nstructured \"knowledge\" from massive trajectory data. In this paper, we focus on\nmodeling users' spatio-temporal mobility patterns based on knowledge graph\ntechniques, and predicting users' future movement based on the ``knowledge''\nextracted from multiple sources in a cohesive manner. Specifically, we propose\na new type of knowledge graph, i.e., spatio-temporal urban knowledge graph\n(STKG), where mobility trajectories, category information of venues, and\ntemporal information are jointly modeled by the facts with different relation\ntypes in STKG. The mobility prediction problem is converted to the knowledge\ngraph completion problem in STKG. Further, a complex embedding model with\nelaborately designed scoring functions is proposed to measure the plausibility\nof facts in STKG to solve the knowledge graph completion problem, which\nconsiders temporal dynamics of the mobility patterns and utilizes PoI\ncategories as the auxiliary information and background knowledge. Extensive\nevaluations confirm the high accuracy of our model in predicting users'\nmobility, i.e., improving the accuracy by 5.04% compared with the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, PoI categories as the background\nknowledge and auxiliary information are confirmed to be helpful by improving\nthe performance by 3.85% in terms of accuracy.

We consider a family of Markov\ndecision processes $\\mathcal{M}$ of which the reward functions lie in the unit\nball of an RKHS and transition probabilities lie in a given arbitrary set.

We show that $\\Delta_{\\mathcal{M}}(\\epsilon)$ gives\nboth the lower bound of the error of all possible algorithms and the upper\nbound of two specific algorithms (fitted reward and fitted Q-iteration) for the\nRL problem. Hence, the decay of $\\Delta_\\mathcal{M}(\\epsilon)$ with respect to\n$\\epsilon$ measures the difficulty of the RL problem on $\\mathcal{M}$. We\nfurther provide some concrete examples and discuss whether\n$\\Delta_{\\mathcal{M}}(\\epsilon)$ decays fast or not in these examples.

However, the direct\nuse of RL algorithms in the RS setting is impractical due to challenges like\noff-policy training, huge action spaces and lack of sufficient reward signals.\nRecent RL approaches for RS attempt to tackle these challenges by combining RL\nand (self-)supervised sequential learning, but still suffer from certain\nlimitations. For example, the estimation of Q-values tends to be biased toward\npositive values due to the lack of negative reward signals. Moreover, the\nQ-values also depend heavily on the specific timestamp of a sequence.\nTo address the above problems, we propose negative sampling strategy for\ntraining the RL component and combine it with supervised sequential learning.\nWe call this method Supervised Negative Q-learning (SNQN).

    "abstract": "We study the counting problem known as #PPM, whose input is a pair of\npermutations $\\pi$ and $\\tau$ (called pattern and text, respectively), and the\ntask is to find the number of subsequences of $\\tau$ that have the same\nrelative order as $\\pi$. A simple brute-force approach solves #PPM for a\npattern of length $k$ and a text of length $n$ in time $O(n^{k+1})$, while\nBerendsohn, Kozma and Marx have recently shown that under the exponential time\nhypothesis (ETH), it cannot be solved in time $f(k) n^{o(k/\\log k)}$ for any\nfunction $f$. In this paper, we consider the restriction of #PPM, known as\n$\\mathcal{C}$-Pattern #PPM, where the pattern $\\pi$ must belong to a hereditary\npermutation class $\\mathcal{C}$. Our goal is to identify the structural\nproperties of $\\mathcal{C}$ that determine the complexity of\n$\\mathcal{C}$-Pattern #PPM.\nWe focus on two such structural properties, known as the long path property\n(LPP) and the deep tree property (DTP). Assuming ETH, we obtain these results:\n1. If $C$ has the LPP, then $\\mathcal{C}$-Pattern #PPM cannot be solved in\ntime $f(k)n^{o(\\sqrt{k})}$ for any function $f$, and\n2. if $C$ has the DTP, then $\\mathcal{C}$-Pattern #PPM cannot be solved in\ntime $f(k)n^{o(k/\\log^2 k)}$ for any function $f$.\nFurthermore, when $\\mathcal{C}$ is one of the so-called monotone grid\nclasses, we show that if $\\mathcal{C}$ has the LPP but not the DTP, then\n$\\mathcal{C}$-Pattern #PPM can be solved in time $f(k)n^{O(\\sqrt k)}$.

    "abstract": "We present a new perspective of achieving image synthesis by viewing this\ntask as a visual token generation problem. Different from existing paradigms\nthat directly synthesize a full image from a single input (e.g., a latent\ncode), the new formulation enables a flexible local manipulation for different\nimage regions, which makes it possible to learn content-aware and fine-grained\nstyle control for image synthesis. Specifically, it takes as input a sequence\nof latent tokens to predict the visual tokens for synthesizing an image. Under\nthis perspective, we propose a token-based generator (i.e.,TokenGAN).\nParticularly, the TokenGAN inputs two semantically different visual tokens,\ni.e., the learned constant content tokens and the style tokens from the latent\nspace. Given a sequence of style tokens, the TokenGAN is able to control the\nimage synthesis by assigning the styles to the content tokens by attention\nmechanism with a Transformer. We conduct extensive experiments and show that\nthe proposed TokenGAN has achieved state-of-the-art results on several\nwidely-used image synthesis benchmarks, including FFHQ and LSUN CHURCH with\ndifferent resolutions. In particular, the generator is able to synthesize\nhigh-fidelity images with 1024x1024 size, dispensing with convolutions\nentirely.",

    "abstract": "Among prerequisites for a synthetic agent to interact with dynamic scenes,\nthe ability to identify independently moving objects is specifically important.\nFrom an application perspective, nevertheless, standard cameras may deteriorate\nremarkably under aggressive motion and challenging illumination conditions. In\ncontrast, event-based cameras, as a category of novel biologically inspired\nsensors, deliver advantages to deal with these challenges. Its rapid response\nand asynchronous nature enables it to capture visual stimuli at exactly the\nsame rate of the scene dynamics. In this paper, we present a cascaded two-level\nmulti-model fitting method for identifying independently moving objects (i.e.,\nthe motion segmentation problem) with a monocular event camera. The first level\nleverages tracking of event features and solves the feature clustering problem\nunder a progressive multi-model fitting scheme. Initialized with the resulting\nmotion model instances, the second level further addresses the event clustering\nproblem using a spatio-temporal graph-cut method. This combination leads to\nefficient and accurate event-wise motion segmentation that cannot be achieved\nby any of them alone. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility\nof our method in real-world scenes with different motion patterns and an\nunknown number of independently moving objects.",

It constitutes a prominent topic in\nmathematical and engineering literature. In this work, we analyze a sparse\nversion of the problem: The filter $h\\in \\mathbb{R}^\\mu$ is assumed to be\n$s$-sparse, and the signal $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is taken to be $\\sigma$-sparse,\nboth supports being unknown. We observe a convolution between the filter and a\nlinear transformation of the signal. Motivated by practically important\nmulti-user communication applications, we derive a recovery guarantee for the\nsimultaneous demixing and deconvolution setting. We achieve efficient recovery\nby relaxing the problem to a hierarchical sparse recovery for which we can\nbuild on a flexible framework. At the same time, for this we pay the price of\nsome sub-optimal guarantees compared to the number of free parameters of the\nproblem. The signal model we consider is sufficiently general to capture many\napplications in a number of engineering fields.

    "abstract": "A cloud service provider strives to provide a high Quality of Service (QoS)\nto client jobs. Such jobs vary in computational and Service-Level-Agreement\n(SLA) obligations, as well as differ with respect to tolerating delays and SLA\nviolations. The job scheduling plays a critical role in servicing cloud demands\nby allocating appropriate resources to execute client jobs. The response to\nsuch jobs is optimized by the cloud provider on a multi-tier cloud computing\nenvironment. Typically, the complex and dynamic nature of multi-tier\nenvironments incurs difficulties in meeting such demands, because tiers are\ndependent on each other which in turn makes bottlenecks of a tier shift to\nescalate in subsequent tiers. However, the optimization process of existing\napproaches produces single-tier-driven schedules that do not employ the\ndifferential impact of SLA violations in executing client jobs. Furthermore,\nthe impact of schedules optimized at the tier level on the performance of\nschedules formulated in subsequent tiers tends to be ignored, resulting in a\nless than optimal performance when measured at the multi-tier level. Thus,\nfailing in committing job obligations incurs SLA penalties that often take the\nform of either financial compensations, or losing future interests and\nmotivations of unsatisfied clients in the service provided. In this paper, a\nscheduling and allocation approach is proposed to formulate schedules that\naccount for differential impacts of SLA violation penalties and, thus, produce\nschedules that are optimal in financial performance. A queue virtualization\nscheme is designed to facilitate the formulation of optimal schedules at the\ntier and multi-tier levels of the cloud environment. Because the scheduling\nproblem is NP-hard, a biologically inspired approach is proposed to mitigate\nthe complexity of finding optimal schedules.",

Previous approaches distribute smaller models to clients\nfor distilling the characteristic of local data. But the problem of training\nwith vast amounts of local data on the client side still remains. We propose to\nreduce the amount of local data that is needed to train a global model. We do\nthis by splitting the model into a lower part for generic feature extraction\nand an upper part that is more sensitive to the characteristics of the local\ndata.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces SocialVec, a general framework for eliciting social\nworld knowledge from social networks, and applies this framework to Twitter.\nSocialVec learns low-dimensional embeddings of popular accounts, which\nrepresent entities of general interest, based on their co-occurrences patterns\nwithin the accounts followed by individual users, thus modeling entity\nsimilarity in socio-demographic terms. Similar to word embeddings, which\nfacilitate tasks that involve text processing, we expect social entity\nembeddings to benefit tasks of social flavor. We have learned social embeddings\nfor roughly 200,000 popular accounts from a sample of the Twitter network that\nincludes more than 1.3 million users and the accounts that they follow, and\nevaluate the resulting embeddings on two different tasks. The first task\ninvolves the automatic inference of personal traits of users from their social\nmedia profiles. In another study, we exploit SocialVec embeddings for gauging\nthe political bias of news sources in Twitter. In both cases, we prove\nSocialVec embeddings to be advantageous compared with existing entity embedding\nschemes. We will make the SocialVec entity embeddings publicly available to\nsupport further exploration of social world knowledge as reflected in Twitter.",

    "abstract": "Learning from class imbalanced datasets poses challenges for many machine\nlearning algorithms. Many real-world domains are, by definition, class\nimbalanced by virtue of having a majority class that naturally has many more\ninstances than its minority class (e.g. genuine bank transactions occur much\nmore often than fraudulent ones). Many methods have been proposed to solve the\nclass imbalance problem, among the most popular being oversampling techniques\n(such as SMOTE). These methods generate synthetic instances in the minority\nclass, to balance the dataset, performing data augmentations that improve the\nperformance of predictive machine learning (ML) models. In this paper we\nadvance a novel data augmentation method (adapted from eXplainable AI), that\ngenerates synthetic, counterfactual instances in the minority class. Unlike\nother oversampling techniques, this method adaptively combines exist-ing\ninstances from the dataset, using actual feature-values rather than\ninterpolating values between instances. Several experiments using four\ndifferent classifiers and 25 datasets are reported, which show that this\nCounterfactual Augmentation method (CFA) generates useful synthetic data points\nin the minority class. The experiments also show that CFA is competitive with\nmany other oversampling methods many of which are variants of SMOTE. The basis\nfor CFAs performance is discussed, along with the conditions under which it is\nlikely to perform better or worse in future tests.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the movement of animals is crucial to conservation efforts.\nPast research often focuses on factors affecting movement, rather than\nlocations of interest that animals return to or habitat. We explore the use of\nclustering to identify locations of interest to African Elephants in regions of\nSub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis was performed using publicly available\ndatasets for tracking African elephants at Kruger National Park (KNP), South\nAfrica; Etosha National Park, Namibia; as well as areas in Burkina Faso and the\nCongo. Using the DBSCAN and KMeans clustering algorithms, we calculate clusters\nand centroids to simplify elephant movement data and highlight important\nlocations of interest. Through a comparison of feature spaces with and without\ntemperature, we show that temperature is an important feature to explain\nmovement clustering. Recognizing the importance of temperature, we develop a\ntechnique to add external temperature data from an API to other geospatial\ndatasets that would otherwise not have temperature data. After addressing the\nhurdles of using external data with marginally different timestamps, we\nconsider the quality of this data, and the quality of the centroids of the\nclusters calculated based on this external temperature data. Finally, we\noverlay these centroids onto satellite imagery and locations of human\nsettlements to validate the real-life applications of the calculated centroids\nto identify locations of interest for elephants. As expected, we confirmed that\nelephants tend to cluster their movement around sources of water as well as\nsome human settlements, especially those with water holes. Identifying key\nlocations of interest for elephants is beneficial in predicting the movement of\nelephants and preventing poaching. These methods may in the future be applied\nto other animals beyond elephants to identify locations of interests for them.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art results in deep learning have been improving steadily, in\ngood part due to the use of larger models. However, widespread use is\nconstrained by device hardware limitations, resulting in a substantial\nperformance gap between state-of-the-art models and those that can be\neffectively deployed on small devices. While Knowledge Distillation (KD)\ntheoretically enables small student models to emulate larger teacher models, in\npractice selecting a good student architecture requires considerable human\nexpertise. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) appears as a natural solution to\nthis problem but most approaches can be inefficient, as most of the computation\nis spent comparing architectures sampled from the same distribution, with\nnegligible differences in performance. In this paper, we propose to instead\nsearch for a family of student architectures sharing the property of being good\nat learning from a given teacher. Our approach AutoKD, powered by Bayesian\nOptimization, explores a flexible graph-based search space, enabling us to\nautomatically learn the optimal student architecture distribution and KD\nparameters, while being 20x more sample efficient compared to existing\nstate-of-the-art. We evaluate our method on 3 datasets; on large images\nspecifically, we reach the teacher performance while using 3x less memory and\n10x less parameters. Finally, while AutoKD uses the traditional KD loss, it\noutperforms more advanced KD variants using hand-designed students.",

    "abstract": "A $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate distance oracle of an edge-weighted graph is a\ndata structure that returns an approximate shortest path distance between any\ntwo query vertices up to a $(1+\\epsilon)$ factor. Thorup (FOCS 2001, JACM 2004)\nand Klein (SODA 2002) independently constructed a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate\ndistance oracle with $O(n\\log n)$ space, measured in number of words, and\n$O(1)$ query time when $G$ is an undirected planar graph with $n$ vertices and\n$\\epsilon$ is a fixed constant. Many follow-up works gave\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate distance oracles with various trade-offs between\nspace and query time. However, improving $O(n\\log n)$ space bound without\nsacrificing query time remains an open problem for almost two decades. In this\nwork, we resolve this problem affirmatively by constructing a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate distance oracle with optimal $O(n)$ space and $O(1)$\nquery time for undirected planar graphs and fixed $\\epsilon$.\nWe also make substantial progress for planar digraphs with non-negative edge\nweights. For fixed $\\epsilon > 0$, we give a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate\ndistance oracle with space $o(n\\log(Nn))$ and $O(\\log\\log(Nn)$ query time; here\n$N$ is the ratio between the largest and smallest positive edge weight. This\nimproves Thorup's (FOCS 2001, JACM 2004) $O(n\\log(Nn)\\log n)$ space bound by\nmore than a logarithmic factor while matching the query time of his structure.\nThis is the first improvement for planar digraphs in two decades, both in the\nweighted and unweighted setting.",

    "abstract": "Online services like Google provide a variety of application programming\ninterfaces (APIs). These online APIs enable authenticated third-party services\nand applications (apps) to access a user's account data for tasks such as\nsingle sign-on (SSO), calendar integration, and sending email on behalf of the\nuser, among others. Despite their prevalence, API access could pose significant\nprivacy and security risks, where a third-party could have unexpected\nprivileges to a user's account. To gauge users' perceptions and concerns\nregarding third-party apps that integrate with online APIs, we performed a\nmulti-part online survey of Google users. First, we asked n = 432 participants\nto recall if and when they allowed third-party access to their Google account:\n89% recalled using at least one SSO and 52% remembered at least one third-party\napp. In the second survey, we re-recruited n = 214 participants to ask about\nspecific apps and SSOs they've authorized on their own Google accounts. We\ncollected in-the-wild data about users' actual SSOs and authorized apps: 86%\nused Google SSO on at least one service, and 67% had at least one third-party\napp authorized. After examining their apps and SSOs, participants expressed the\nmost concern about access to personal information like email addresses and\nother publicly shared info. However, participants were less concerned with\nbroader -- and perhaps more invasive -- access to calendars, emails, or cloud\nstorage (as needed by third-party apps). This discrepancy may be due in part to\ntrust transference to apps that integrate with Google, forming an implied\npartnership. Our results suggest opportunities for design improvements to the\ncurrent third-party management tools offered by Google; for example, tracking\nrecent access, automatically revoking access due to app disuse, and providing\npermission controls.",

    "title": "Edge Tracing using Gaussian Process Regression",
    "abstract": "We introduce a novel edge tracing algorithm using Gaussian process\nregression. Our edge-based segmentation algorithm models an edge of interest\nusing Gaussian process regression and iteratively searches the image for edge\npixels in a recursive Bayesian scheme. This procedure combines local edge\ninformation from the image gradient and global structural information from\nposterior curves, sampled from the model's posterior predictive distribution,\nto sequentially build and refine an observation set of edge pixels. This\naccumulation of pixels converges the distribution to the edge of interest.\nHyperparameters can be tuned by the user at initialisation and optimised given\nthe refined observation set. This tunable approach does not require any prior\ntraining and is not restricted to any particular type of imaging domain. Due to\nthe model's uncertainty quantification, the algorithm is robust to artefacts\nand occlusions which degrade the quality and continuity of edges in images. Our\napproach also has the ability to efficiently trace edges in image sequences by\nusing previous-image edge traces as a priori information for consecutive\nimages. Various applications to medical imaging and satellite imaging are used\nto validate the technique and comparisons are made with two commonly used edge\ntracing algorithms.",

The\nnovelty is as follows. First, the multi-compressors are non-linear and modeled\nusing second degree polynomials. This may increase the accuracy of the signal\nestimation through the optimization in a higher dimensional parameter space\ncompared to the linear case. Second, the required models are determined by a\nmethod based on a combination of the second degree transform (SDT) with the\nmaximum block improvement (MBI) method and the generalized rank-constrained\nmatrix approximation. It allows us to use the advantages of known methods to\nfurther increase the estimation accuracy of the source signal. Third, the\nproposed method is justified in terms of pseudo-inverse matrices.

    "abstract": "Single image deraining is typically addressed as residual learning to predict\nthe rain layer from an input rainy image. For this purpose, an encoder-decoder\nnetwork draws wide attention, where the encoder is required to encode a\nhigh-quality rain embedding which determines the performance of the subsequent\ndecoding stage to reconstruct the rain layer. However, most of existing studies\nignore the significance of rain embedding quality, thus leading to limited\nperformance with over/under-deraining. In this paper, with our observation of\nthe high rain layer reconstruction performance by an rain-to-rain autoencoder,\nwe introduce the idea of \"Rain Embedding Consistency\" by regarding the encoded\nembedding by the autoencoder as an ideal rain embedding and aim at enhancing\nthe deraining performance by improving the consistency between the ideal rain\nembedding and the rain embedding derived by the encoder of the deraining\nnetwork. To achieve this, a Rain Embedding Loss is applied to directly\nsupervise the encoding process, with a Rectified Local Contrast Normalization\n(RLCN) as the guide that effectively extracts the candidate rain pixels. We\nalso propose Layered LSTM for recurrent deraining and fine-grained encoder\nfeature refinement considering different scales. Qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods particularly on a real-world dataset.

We observe\nthat this question has a deep connection to the Implicit Graph Conjecture (IGC)\nin structural graph theory. Specifically, constant-cost communication problems\ncorrespond to a certain subset of hereditary graph families that satisfy the\nIGC: those that admit constant-size probabilistic universal graphs (PUGs), or,\nequivalently, those that admit constant-size adjacency sketches.\nWe initiate the study of the hereditary graph families that admit\nconstant-size PUGs, with the two (equivalent) goals of (1) giving a structural\ncharacterization of randomized constant-cost communication problems, and (2)\nresolving a probabilistic version of the IGC. For each family $\\mathcal F$\nstudied in this paper (including the monogenic bipartite families, product\ngraphs, interval and permutation graphs, families of bounded twin-width, and\nothers), it holds that the subfamilies $\\mathcal H \\subseteq \\mathcal F$ are\neither stable (in a sense relating to model theory), in which case they admit\nconstant-size PUGs (i.e. adjacency sketches), or they are not stable, in which\ncase they do not. We conjecture that this always holds, i.e. that constant-cost\nrandomized communication problems correspond to the set of stable families that\nsatisfy the IGC.\nAs a consequence of our results, we also obtain constant-size adjacency\nsketches, and an $O(\\log n)$ adjacency labeling scheme, for the induced\nsubgraphs of arbitrary Cartesian products, as well as constant-size\nsmall-distance sketches for Cartesian products and stable families of bounded\ntwin-width (including planar graphs, answering a question from earlier work).",

This metamodel is then deployed in\ndifferent frameworks and its parameters are calibrated using the specific data\nof two real buildings.

Then, energy consumptions are\noptimized while maintaining a target thermal comfort and air quality, using the\nNSGA-II multi-objective optimization procedure.

    "abstract": "This paper is to consider the problems of estimation and recognition from the\nperspective of sigma-max inference (probability-possibility inference), with a\nfocus on discovering whether some of the unknown quantities involved could be\nmore faithfully modeled as fuzzy uncertainty. Two related key issues are\naddressed: 1) the random-fuzzy dual interpretation of unknown quantity being\nestimated; 2) the principle of selecting sigma-max operator for practical\nproblems, such as estimation and recognition. Our perspective, conceived from\ndefinitions of randomness and fuzziness, is that continuous unknown quantity\ninvolved in estimation with inaccurate prior should be more appropriately\nmodeled as randomness and handled by sigma inference; whereas discrete unknown\nquantity involved in recognition with insufficient (and inaccurate) prior could\nbe better modeled as fuzziness and handled by max inference. The philosophy was\ndemonstrated by an updated version of the well-known interacting multiple model\n(IMM) filter, for which the jump Markovian System is reformulated as a hybrid\nuncertainty system, with continuous state evolution modeled as usual as\nmodel-conditioned stochastic system and discrete mode transitions modeled as\nfuzzy system by a possibility (instead of probability) transition matrix, and\nhypotheses mixing is conducted by using the operation of \"max\" instead of\n\"sigma\". For our example of maneuvering target tracking using simulated data\nfrom both a short-range fire control radar and a long-range surveillance radar,\nthe updated IMM filter shows significant improvement over the classic IMM\nfilter, due to its peculiarity of hard decision of system model and a faster\nresponse to the transition of discrete mode.",

    "title": "Recurrent Neural Networks for Learning Long-term Temporal Dependencies  with Reanalysis of Time Scale Representation",
    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks with a gating mechanism such as an LSTM or GRU are\npowerful tools to model sequential data. In the mechanism, a forget gate, which\nwas introduced to control information flow in a hidden state in the RNN, has\nrecently been re-interpreted as a representative of the time scale of the\nstate, i.e., a measure how long the RNN retains information on inputs. On the\nbasis of this interpretation, several parameter initialization methods to\nexploit prior knowledge on temporal dependencies in data have been proposed to\nimprove learnability. However, the interpretation relies on various unrealistic\nassumptions, such as that there are no inputs after a certain time point. In\nthis work, we reconsider this interpretation of the forget gate in a more\nrealistic setting. We first generalize the existing theory on gated RNNs so\nthat we can consider the case where inputs are successively given. We then\nargue that the interpretation of a forget gate as a temporal representation is\nvalid when the gradient of loss with respect to the state decreases\nexponentially as time goes back. We empirically demonstrate that existing RNNs\nsatisfy this gradient condition at the initial training phase on several tasks,\nwhich is in good agreement with previous initialization methods. On the basis\nof this finding, we propose an approach to construct new RNNs that can\nrepresent a longer time scale than conventional models, which will improve the\nlearnability for long-term sequential data. We verify the effectiveness of our\nmethod by experiments with real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "In online learning problems, exploiting low variance plays an important role\nin obtaining tight performance guarantees yet is challenging because variances\nare often not known a priori. Recently, a considerable progress has been made\nby Zhang et al. (2021) where they obtain a variance-adaptive regret bound for\nlinear bandits without knowledge of the variances and a horizon-free regret\nbound for linear mixture Markov decision processes (MDPs). In this paper, we\npresent novel analyses that improve their regret bounds significantly. For\nlinear bandits, we achieve $\\tilde O(d^{1.5}\\sqrt{\\sum_{k}^K \\sigma_k^2} +\nd^2)$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features, $K$ is the time horizon, and\n$\\sigma_k^2$ is the noise variance at time step $k$, and $\\tilde O$ ignores\npolylogarithmic dependence, which is a factor of $d^3$ improvement. For linear\nmixture MDPs, we achieve a horizon-free regret bound of $\\tilde\nO(d^{1.5}\\sqrt{K} + d^3)$ where $d$ is the number of base models and $K$ is the\nnumber of episodes. This is a factor of $d^3$ improvement in the leading term\nand $d^6$ in the lower order term. Our analysis critically relies on a novel\nelliptical potential `count' lemma. This lemma allows a peeling-based regret\nanalysis, which can be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Current learning-based single image super-resolution (SISR) algorithms\nunderperform on real data due to the deviation in the assumed degrada-tion\nprocess from that in the real-world scenario. Conventional degradation\nprocesses consider applying blur, noise, and downsampling (typicallybicubic\ndownsampling) on high-resolution (HR) images to synthesize low-resolution (LR)\ncounterparts. However, few works on degradation modelling have taken the\nphysical aspects of the optical imaging system intoconsideration. In this\npaper, we analyze the imaging system optically andexploit the characteristics\nof the real-world LR-HR pairs in the spatial frequency domain. We formulate a\nreal-world physics-inspired degradationmodel by considering\nbothopticsandsensordegradation; The physical degradation of an imaging system\nis modelled as a low-pass filter, whose cut-off frequency is dictated by the\nobject distance, the focal length of thelens, and the pixel size of the image\nsensor. In particular, we propose to use a convolutional neural network (CNN)\nto learn the cutoff frequency of real-world degradation process. The learned\nnetwork is then applied to synthesize LR images from unpaired HR images. The\nsynthetic HR-LR image pairs are later used to train an SISR network. We\nevaluatethe effectiveness and generalization capability of the proposed\ndegradation model on real-world images captured by different imaging systems.\nExperimental results showcase that the SISR network trained by using our\nsynthetic data performs favorably against the network using the traditional\ndegradation model.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Segmentation of liver vessels from CT images is indispensable prior\nto surgical planning and aroused broad range of interests in the medical image\nanalysis community. Due to the complex structure and low contrast background,\nautomatic liver vessel segmentation remains particularly challenging. Most of\nthe related researches adopt FCN, U-net, and V-net variants as a backbone.\nHowever, these methods mainly focus on capturing multi-scale local features\nwhich may produce misclassified voxels due to the convolutional operator's\nlimited locality reception field.\nMethods: We propose a robust end-to-end vessel segmentation network called\nInductive BIased Multi-Head Attention Vessel Net(IBIMHAV-Net) by expanding swin\ntransformer to 3D and employing an effective combination of convolution and\nself-attention. In practice, we introduce the voxel-wise embedding rather than\npatch-wise embedding to locate precise liver vessel voxels, and adopt\nmulti-scale convolutional operators to gain local spatial information. On the\nother hand, we propose the inductive biased multi-head self-attention which\nlearns inductive biased relative positional embedding from initialized absolute\nposition embedding. Based on this, we can gain a more reliable query and key\nmatrix. To validate the generalization of our model, we test on samples which\nhave different structural complexity.\nResults: We conducted experiments on the 3DIRCADb datasets. The average dice\nand sensitivity of the four tested cases were 74.8% and 77.5%, which exceed\nresults of existing deep learning methods and improved graph cuts method.\nConclusion: The proposed model IBIMHAV-Net provides an automatic, accurate 3D\nliver vessel segmentation with an interleaved architecture that better utilizes\nboth global and local spatial features in CT volumes. It can be further\nextended for other clinical data.",

    "abstract": "Learned video compression methods have demonstrated great promise in catching\nup with traditional video codecs in their rate-distortion (R-D) performance.\nHowever, existing learned video compression schemes are limited by the binding\nof the prediction mode and the fixed network framework. They are unable to\nsupport various inter prediction modes and thus inapplicable for various\nscenarios. In this paper, to break this limitation, we propose a versatile\nlearned video compression (VLVC) framework that uses one model to support all\npossible prediction modes. Specifically, to realize versatile compression, we\nfirst build a motion compensation module that applies multiple 3D motion vector\nfields (i.e., voxel flows) for weighted trilinear warping in spatial-temporal\nspace. The voxel flows convey the information of temporal reference position\nthat helps to decouple inter prediction modes away from framework designing.\nSecondly, in case of multiple-reference-frame prediction, we apply a flow\nprediction module to predict accurate motion trajectories with a unified\npolynomial function. We show that the flow prediction module can largely reduce\nthe transmission cost of voxel flows. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed VLVC not only supports versatile compression in various settings but\nalso achieves comparable R-D performance with the latest VVC standard in terms\nof MS-SSIM.",

In this study, we propose to build an\nensemble of convolutional neural network models to suppress bones in frontal\nCXRs, improve classification performance, and reduce interpretation errors\nrelated to COVID-19 detection. The ensemble is constructed by (i) measuring the\nmulti-scale structural similarity index (MS-SSIM) score between the sub-blocks\nof the bone-suppressed image predicted by each of the top-3 performing\nbone-suppression models and the corresponding sub-blocks of its respective\nground truth soft-tissue image, and (ii) performing a majority voting of the\nMS-SSIM score computed in each sub-block to identify the sub-block with the\nmaximum MS-SSIM score and use it in constructing the final bone-suppressed\nimage. We empirically determine the sub-block size that delivers superior bone\nsuppression performance. It is observed that the bone suppression model\nensemble outperformed the individual models in terms of MS-SSIM and other\nmetrics. A CXR modality-specific classification model is retrained and\nevaluated on the non-bone-suppressed and bone-suppressed images to classify\nthem as showing normal lungs or other COVID-19-like manifestations.

    "title": "ProSTformer: Pre-trained Progressive Space-Time Self-attention Model for  Traffic Flow Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Traffic flow forecasting is essential and challenging to intelligent city\nmanagement and public safety. Recent studies have shown the potential of\nconvolution-free Transformer approach to extract the dynamic dependencies among\ncomplex influencing factors. However, two issues prevent the approach from\nbeing effectively applied in traffic flow forecasting. First, it ignores the\nspatiotemporal structure of the traffic flow videos. Second, for a long\nsequence, it is hard to focus on crucial attention due to the quadratic times\ndot-product computation. To address the two issues, we first factorize the\ndependencies and then design a progressive space-time self-attention mechanism\nnamed ProSTformer. It has two distinctive characteristics: (1) corresponding to\nthe factorization, the self-attention mechanism progressively focuses on\nspatial dependence from local to global regions, on temporal dependence from\ninside to outside fragment (i.e., closeness, period, and trend), and finally on\nexternal dependence such as weather, temperature, and day-of-week; (2) by\nincorporating the spatiotemporal structure into the self-attention mechanism,\neach block in ProSTformer highlights the unique dependence by aggregating the\nregions with spatiotemporal positions to significantly decrease the\ncomputation. We evaluate ProSTformer on two traffic datasets, and each dataset\nincludes three separate datasets with big, medium, and small scales. Despite\nthe radically different design compared to the convolutional architectures for\ntraffic flow forecasting, ProSTformer performs better or the same on the big\nscale datasets than six state-of-the-art baseline methods by RMSE. When\npre-trained on the big scale datasets and transferred to the medium and small\nscale datasets, ProSTformer achieves a significant enhancement and behaves\nbest.",

    "title": "Pregeometric Spaces from Wolfram Model Rewriting Systems as Homotopy  Types",
    "abstract": "How do spaces emerge from pregeometric discrete building blocks governed by\ncomputational rules? To address this, we investigate non-deterministic\nrewriting systems (multiway systems) of the Wolfram model. We formalize these\nrewriting systems as homotopy types. Using this new formulation, we outline how\nspatial structures can be functorially inherited from pregeometric\ntype-theoretic constructions. We show how higher homotopy types are constructed\nfrom rewriting rules. These correspond to morphisms of an $n$-fold category.\nSubsequently, the $n \\to \\infty$ limit of the Wolfram model rulial multiway\nsystem is identified as an $\\infty$-groupoid, with the latter being relevant\ngiven Grothendieck's homotopy hypothesis. We then go on to show how this\nconstruction extends to the classifying space of rulial multiway systems, which\nforms a multiverse of multiway systems and carries the formal structure of an\n${\\left(\\infty, 1\\right)}$-topos. This correspondence to higher categorical\nstructures offers a new way to understand how spaces relevant to physics may\nresult from pregeometric combinatorial models. The key issue we have addressed\nhere is to formally relate abstract non-deterministic rewriting systems to\nhigher homotopy spaces. A consequence of constructing spaces and geometry\nsynthetically is that it removes ad hoc assumptions about geometric attributes\nof a model such as an a priori background or pre-assigned geometric data.\nInstead, geometry is inherited functorially from globular structures. This is\nrelevant for formally justifying different choices of underlying spacetime\ndiscretization adopted by various models of quantum gravity. Finally, we end\nwith comments on how the framework of higher category-theoretic combinatorial\nconstructions developed here, corroborates with other approaches investigating\nhigher categorical structures relevant to the foundations of physics.",

    "abstract": "In general, speech processing models consist of a language model along with\nan acoustic model. Regardless of the language model's complexity and variants,\nthree critical pre-processing steps are needed in language models: cleaning,\nnormalization, and tokenization. Among mentioned steps, the normalization step\nis so essential to format unification in pure textual applications. However,\nfor embedded language models in speech processing modules, normalization is not\nlimited to format unification. Moreover, it has to convert each readable\nsymbol, number, etc., to how they are pronounced. To the best of our knowledge,\nthere is no Persian normalization toolkits for embedded language models in\nspeech processing modules, So in this paper, we propose an open-source\nnormalization toolkit for text processing in speech applications. Briefly, we\nconsider different readable Persian text like symbols (common currencies, #, @,\nURL, etc.), numbers (date, time, phone number, national code, etc.), and so on.\nComparison with other available Persian textual normalization tools indicates\nthe superiority of the proposed method in speech processing. Also, comparing\nthe model's performance for one of the proposed functions (sentence separation)\nwith other common natural language libraries such as HAZM and Parsivar\nindicates the proper performance of the proposed method. Besides, its\nevaluation of some Persian Wikipedia data confirms the proper performance of\nthe proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The identification of regions of similar climatological behavior can be\nutilized for the discovery of spatial relationships over long-range scales,\nincluding teleconnections. In this regard, the global picture of the\ninterdependence patterns of extreme rainfall events (EREs) still needs to be\nfurther explored. To this end, we propose a top-down complex-network-based\nclustering workflow, with the combination of consensus clustering and mutual\ncorrespondences. Consensus clustering provides a reliable community structure\nunder each dataset, while mutual correspondences build a matching relationship\nbetween different community structures obtained from different datasets. This\napproach ensures the robustness of the identified structures when multiple\ndatasets are available. By applying it simultaneously to two satellite-derived\nprecipitation datasets, we identify consistent synchronized structures of EREs\naround the globe, during boreal summer. Two of them show independent\nspatiotemporal characteristics, uncovering the primary compositions of\ndifferent monsoon systems. They explicitly manifest the primary intraseasonal\nvariability in the context of the global monsoon, in particular the `monsoon\njump' over both East Asia and West Africa and the mid-summer drought over\nCentral America and southern Mexico. Through a case study related to the Asian\nsummer monsoon (ASM), we verify that the intraseasonal changes of upper-level\natmospheric conditions are preserved by significant connections within the\nglobal synchronization structure. Our work advances network-based clustering\nmethodology for (i) decoding the spatiotemporal configuration of\ninterdependence patterns of natural variability and for (ii) the\nintercomparison of these patterns, especially regarding their spatial\ndistributions over different datasets.",

    "title": "Blind Extraction of Target Speech Source Guided by Supervised Speaker  Identification via X-vectors",
    "abstract": "This manuscript proposes a novel robust procedure for extraction of a speaker\nof interest (SOI) from a mixture of audio sources. The estimation of the SOI is\nblind, performed via independent vector extraction. A recently proposed\nconstant separating vector (CSV) model is employed, which improves the\nestimation of moving sources. The blind algorithm is guided towards the SOI via\nthe frame-wise speaker identification, which is trained in a supervised manner\nand is independent of a specific scenario. When processing challenging data, an\nincorrect speaker may be extracted due to limitations of this guidance. To\nidentify such cases, a criterion non-intrusively assessing quality of the\nestimated SOI is proposed. It utilizes the same model as the speaker\nidentification; no additional training is therefore required. Using this\ncriterion, the ``deflation'' approach to extraction is presented. If an\nincorrect source is estimated, it is subtracted from the mixture and the\nextraction of the SOI is performed again from the reduced mixture. The proposed\nprocedure is experimentally tested on both artificial and real-world datasets\ncontaining challenging phenomena: source movements, reverberation, transient\nnoise or microphone failures. The presented method is comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art blind algorithms on static mixtures; it is more accurate for\nmixtures containing source movements. Compared to fully supervised methods, the\nproposed procedure achieves a lower level of accuracy but requires no\nscenario-specific data for the training.",

We prove the existence of stationary\nsolutions of the Euler equations in Euclidean space, of Beltrami type, that can\nsimulate a universal Turing machine. In particular, these solutions possess\nundecidable trajectories. Heretofore, the known Turing complete constructions\nof steady Euler flows in dimension 3 or higher were not associated to a\nprescribed metric. Our solutions do not have finite energy, and their\nconstruction makes crucial use of the non-compactness of $\\mathbb R^3$, however\nthey can be employed to show that an arbitrary tape-bounded Turing machine can\nbe robustly simulated by a Beltrami flow on $\\mathbb T^3$ (with the standard\nflat metric). This shows that there exist steady solutions to the Euler\nequations on the flat torus exhibiting dynamical phenomena of (robust)\narbitrarily high computational complexity. We also quantify the energetic cost\nfor a Beltrami field on $\\mathbb T^3$ to simulate a tape-bounded Turing\nmachine, thus providing additional support for the space-bounded Church-Turing\nthesis. Another implication of our construction is that a Gaussian random\nBeltrami field on Euclidean space exhibits arbitrarily high computational\ncomplexity with probability $1$.
