    "abstract": "There is a growing need for anomaly detection methods that can broaden the\nsearch for new particles in a model-agnostic manner. Most proposals for new\nmethods focus exclusively on signal sensitivity. However, it is not enough to\nselect anomalous events - there must also be a strategy to provide context to\nthe selected events. We propose the first complete strategy for unsupervised\ndetection of non-resonant anomalies that includes both signal sensitivity and a\ndata-driven method for background estimation. Our technique is built out of two\nsimultaneously-trained autoencoders that are forced to be decorrelated from\neach other. This method can be deployed offline for non-resonant anomaly\ndetection and is also the first complete online-compatible anomaly detection\nstrategy. We show that our method achieves excellent performance on a variety\nof signals prepared for the ADC2021 data challenge.",

    "abstract": "The past decade has seen significant progress in artificial intelligence\n(AI), which has resulted in algorithms being adopted for resolving a variety of\nproblems. However, this success has been met by increasing model complexity and\nemploying black-box AI models that lack transparency. In response to this need,\nExplainable AI (XAI) has been proposed to make AI more transparent and thus\nadvance the adoption of AI in critical domains. Although there are several\nreviews of XAI topics in the literature that identified challenges and\npotential research directions in XAI, these challenges and research directions\nare scattered. This study, hence, presents a systematic meta-survey for\nchallenges and future research directions in XAI organized in two themes: (1)\ngeneral challenges and research directions in XAI and (2) challenges and\nresearch directions in XAI based on machine learning life cycle's phases:\ndesign, development, and deployment. We believe that our meta-survey\ncontributes to XAI literature by providing a guide for future exploration in\nthe XAI area.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of allocating human operators in a\nsystem with multiple semi-autonomous robots. Each robot is required to perform\nan independent sequence of tasks, subjected to a chance of failing and getting\nstuck in a fault state at every task. If and when required, a human operator\ncan assist or teleoperate a robot. Conventional MDP techniques used to solve\nsuch problems face scalability issues due to exponential growth of state and\naction spaces with the number of robots and operators. In this paper we derive\nconditions under which the operator allocation problem is indexable, enabling\nthe use of the Whittle index heuristic. The conditions can be easily checked to\nverify indexability, and we show that they hold for a wide range of problems of\ninterest. Our key insight is to leverage the structure of the value function of\nindividual robots, resulting in conditions that can be verified separately for\neach state of each robot. We apply these conditions to two types of transitions\ncommonly seen in remote robot supervision systems. Through numerical\nsimulations, we demonstrate the efficacy of Whittle index policy as a\nnear-optimal and scalable approach that outperforms existing scalable methods.",

Under these\nrestrictions, we formulated and analyzed the achievable rate and maximum\ndeparture regions in two well-studied scenarios, i.e., a classical PS-SWIPT MAC\nand a PS-SWIPT MAC with user cooperation. In the classical PS-SWIPT MAC\nsetting, closed-form expressions for the optimal values of the PS factors are\nderived for two fundamental decoding schemes: simultaneous decoding and\nsuccessive interference cancellation. In the PS-SWIPT MAC with user\ncooperation, the joint optimal power allocation for users as well as the\noptimal PS factor are derived. This reveals that one decoding scheme\noutperforms the other in the classical PS-SWIPT MAC, depending on the function\ntype of the decoding cost. Finally, it is shown that the cooperation between\nusers can potentially boost the performance of a PS-SWIPT MAC under decoding\ncost and non-linear EH constraints. Moreover, effects of the decoding cost\nfunctions, non-linear EH model and channel quality between the users are\nstudied, and performance characteristics of the system are discussed.",

Error\ncovariance matrices modelling is an important element in data assimilation\nalgorithms which can considerably impact the forecasting accuracy. The\nestimation of these covariances, which usually relies on empirical assumptions\nand physical constraints, is often imprecise and computationally expensive\nespecially for systems of large dimension. In this work, we propose a\ndata-driven approach based on long short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNN) to improve both the accuracy and the efficiency of observation\ncovariance specification in data assimilation for dynamical systems. Learning\nthe covariance matrix from observed/simulated time-series data, the proposed\napproach does not require any knowledge or assumption about prior error\ndistribution, unlike classical posterior tuning methods. We have compared the\nnovel approach with two state-of-the-art covariance tuning algorithms, namely\nDI01 and D05, first in a Lorenz dynamical system and then in a 2D shallow water\ntwin experiments framework with different covariance parameterization using\nensemble assimilation.

The onboard path planner is unified across legged and flying robots\nand enables navigation in environments with steep slopes, and diverse\ngeometries. When a communication link is available, each robot of the team\nshares submaps to a centralized location where a multi-robot coordination\nframework identifies global frontiers of the exploration space to inform each\nsystem about where it should re-position to best continue its mission. The\nstrategy is verified through a field deployment inside an underground mine in\nSwitzerland using a legged and a flying robot collectively exploring for 45\nmin, as well as a longer simulation study with three systems.",

    "abstract": "We present the Sequential Aggregation and Rematerialization (SAR) scheme for\ndistributed full-batch training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large\ngraphs. Large-scale training of GNNs has recently been dominated by\nsampling-based methods and methods based on non-learnable message passing. SAR\non the other hand is a distributed technique that can train any GNN type\ndirectly on an entire large graph. The key innovation in SAR is the distributed\nsequential rematerialization scheme which sequentially re-constructs then frees\npieces of the prohibitively large GNN computational graph during the backward\npass. This results in excellent memory scaling behavior where the memory\nconsumption per worker goes down linearly with the number of workers, even for\ndensely connected graphs. Using SAR, we report the largest applications of\nfull-batch GNN training to-date, and demonstrate large memory savings as the\nnumber of workers increases. We also present a general technique based on\nkernel fusion and attention-matrix rematerialization to optimize both the\nruntime and memory efficiency of attention-based models.

    "abstract": "This paper develops and investigates a new method for the application of\nDirichlet boundary conditions for computational models defined by point clouds.\nPoint cloud models often stem from laser or structured-light scanners which are\nused to scan existing mechanical structures for which CAD models either do not\nexist or from which the artifact under investigation deviates in shape or\ntopology. Instead of reconstructing a CAD model from point clouds via surface\nreconstruction and a subsequent boundary conforming mesh generation, a direct\nanalysis without pre-processing is possible using embedded domain finite\nelement methods. These methods use non-boundary conforming meshes which calls\nfor a weak enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions. For point cloud based\nmodels, Dirichlet boundary conditions are usually imposed using a diffuse\ninterface approach. This leads to a significant computational overhead due to\nthe necessary computation of domain integrals. Additionally, undesired side\neffects on the gradients of the solution arise which can only be controlled to\nsome extent. This paper develops a new sharp interface approach for point cloud\nbased models which avoids both issues. The computation of domain integrals is\ncircumvented by an implicit approximation of corresponding Voronoi diagrams of\nhigher order and the resulting sharp approximation avoids the side-effects of\ndiffuse approaches. Benchmark examples from the graphics as well as the\ncomputational mechanics community are used to verify the algorithm.

Kolipaka and Szegedy\n(STOC'11) proved that the Moser-Tardos algorithm is efficient up to the tight\ncondition of the abstract Lov{\\'a}sz Local Lemma, known as Shearer's bound. A\nfundamental problem around LLL is whether the efficient region of the\nMoser-Tardos algorithm can be further extended. In this paper, we give a\npositive answer to this problem. We show that the efficient region of the\nMoser-Tardos algorithm goes beyond the Shearer's bound of the underlying\ndependency graph, if the graph is not chordal. Otherwise, the dependency graph\nis chordal, and it has been shown that Shearer's bound exactly characterizes\nthe efficient region for such graphs (Kolipaka and Szegedy, STOC'11; He, Li,\nLiu, Wang and Xia, FOCS'17). Moreover, we demonstrate that the efficient region\ncan exceed Shearer's bound by a constant by explicitly calculating the gaps on\nseveral infinite lattices. The core of our proof is a new criterion on the\nefficiency of the Moser-Tardos algorithm which takes the intersection between\ndependent events into consideration. Our criterion is strictly better than\nShearer's bound whenever the intersection exists between dependent events.\nMeanwhile, if any two dependent events are mutually exclusive, our criterion\nbecomes the Shearer's bound, which is known to be tight in this situation for\nthe Moser-Tardos algorithm (Kolipaka and Szegedy, STOC'11; Guo, Jerrum and Liu,\nJACM'19).",

    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied for\nvarious real-world applications, and achieved significant performance for\ncognitive problems. However, the increment of DNNs' width and depth in\narchitecture results in a huge amount of parameters to challenge the storage\nand memory cost, limiting to the usage of DNNs on resource-constrained\nplatforms, such as portable devices. By converting redundant models into\ncompact ones, compression technique appears to be a practical solution to\nreducing the storage and memory consumption. In this paper, we develop a\nnonlinear tensor ring network (NTRN) in which both fullyconnected and\nconvolutional layers are compressed via tensor ring decomposition. Furthermore,\nto mitigate the accuracy loss caused by compression, a nonlinear activation\nfunction is embedded into the tensor contraction and convolution operations\ninside the compressed layer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness\nand superiority of the proposed NTRN for image classification using two basic\nneural networks, LeNet-5 and VGG-11 on three datasets, viz.

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sample-efficient approach to optimizing\ncostly-to-evaluate black-box functions. Most BO methods ignore how evaluation\ncosts may vary over the optimization domain. However, these costs can be highly\nheterogeneous and are often unknown in advance. This occurs in many practical\nsettings, such as hyperparameter tuning of machine learning algorithms or\nphysics-based simulation optimization. Moreover, those few existing methods\nthat acknowledge cost heterogeneity do not naturally accommodate a budget\nconstraint on the total evaluation cost. This combination of unknown costs and\na budget constraint introduces a new dimension to the exploration-exploitation\ntrade-off, where learning about the cost incurs the cost itself. Existing\nmethods do not reason about the various trade-offs of this problem in a\nprincipled way, leading often to poor performance. We formalize this claim by\nproving that the expected improvement and the expected improvement per unit of\ncost, arguably the two most widely used acquisition functions in practice, can\nbe arbitrarily inferior with respect to the optimal non-myopic policy. To\novercome the shortcomings of existing approaches, we propose the budgeted\nmulti-step expected improvement, a non-myopic acquisition function that\ngeneralizes classical expected improvement to the setting of heterogeneous and\nunknown evaluation costs. Finally, we show that our acquisition function\noutperforms existing methods in a variety of synthetic and real problems.",

In this\npaper, we consider a RIS-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output downlink\ncommunication system. We aim to maximize the weighted sum-rate of all users by\njoint optimizing the active beamforming at the access point and the passive\nbeamforming vector of the RIS elements. Unlike most existing works, we consider\nthe more practical situation with the discrete phase shifts and imperfect\nchannel state information (CSI). Specifically, for the situation that the\ndiscrete phase shifts and perfect CSI are considered, we first develop a deep\nquantization neural network (DQNN) to simultaneously design the active and\npassive beamforming while most reported works design them alternatively. Then,\nwe propose an improved structure (I-DQNN) based on DQNN to simplify the\nparameters decision process when the control bits of each RIS element are\ngreater than 1 bit. Finally, we extend the two proposed DQNN-based algorithms\nto the case that the discrete phase shifts and imperfect CSI are considered\nsimultaneously.

LDT indicates that the tail\ndistribution of the queue length has a linear-decay-rate exponent.

In this paper, we put\nour focus on the analysis of the tail distribution of the queue length from the\nperspective of cross-layer design in wireless link transmission.

As graph\nconvolution network (GCN), a variant of neural networks on graph-type data, has\nachieved impressive performance, it is attractive to find whether GCNs can be\nused to augment the graph-based clustering methods on non-graph data, i.e.,\ngeneral data. However, given $n$ samples, the graph-based clustering methods\nusually need at least $O(n^2)$ time to build graphs and the graph convolution\nrequires nearly $O(n^2)$ for a dense graph and $O(|\\mathcal{E}|)$ for a sparse\none with $|\\mathcal{E}|$ edges. In other words, both graph-based clustering and\nGCNs suffer from severe inefficiency problems. To tackle this problem and\nfurther employ GCN to promote the capacity of graph-based clustering, we\npropose a novel clustering method, AnchorGAE. As the graph structure is not\nprovided in general clustering scenarios, we first show how to convert a\nnon-graph dataset into a graph by introducing the generative graph model, which\nis used to build GCNs. Anchors are generated from the original data to\nconstruct a bipartite graph such that the computational complexity of graph\nconvolution is reduced from $O(n^2)$ and $O(|\\mathcal{E}|)$ to $O(n)$. The\nsucceeding steps for clustering can be easily designed as $O(n)$ operations.\nInterestingly, the anchors naturally lead to a siamese GCN architecture. The\nbipartite graph constructed by anchors is updated dynamically to exploit the\nhigh-level information behind data.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a robust learning methodology to place the closed-loop\npoles in desired convex regions in the complex plane. We considered the system\nstate and input matrices to be unknown and can only use the measurements of the\nsystem trajectories. The closed-loop pole placement problem in the linear\nmatrix inequality (LMI) regions is considered a classic robust control problem;\nhowever, that requires knowledge about the state and input matrices of the\nlinear system. We bring in ideas from the behavioral system theory and\npersistency of excitation condition-based fundamental lemma to develop a\ndata-driven counterpart that satisfies multiple closed-loop robustness\nspecifications, such as $\\mathcal{D}$-stability and mixed $H_2/H_{\\infty}$\nperformance specifications. Our formulations lead to data-driven semi-definite\nprograms (SDPs) that are coupled with sufficient theoretical guarantees. We\nvalidate the theoretical results with numerical simulations on a third-order\ndynamic system.",

    "title": "Implicit vs Unfolded Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "It has been observed that graph neural networks (GNN) sometimes struggle to\nmaintain a healthy balance between modeling long-range dependencies across\nnodes while avoiding unintended consequences such as oversmoothed node\nrepresentations. To address this issue (among other things), two separate\nstrategies have recently been proposed, namely implicit and unfolded GNNs. The\nformer treats node representations as the fixed points of a deep equilibrium\nmodel that can efficiently facilitate arbitrary implicit propagation across the\ngraph with a fixed memory footprint. In contrast, the latter involves treating\ngraph propagation as the unfolded descent iterations as applied to some\ngraph-regularized energy function. While motivated differently, in this paper\nwe carefully elucidate the similarity and differences of these methods,\nquantifying explicit situations where the solutions they produced may actually\nbe equivalent and others where behavior diverges. This includes the analysis of\nconvergence, representational capacity, and interpretability. We also provide\nempirical head-to-head comparisons across a variety of synthetic and public\nreal-world benchmarks.",

In particular\nwe focus on the problem of data transfer, which can be a performance bottleneck\ndue to the limited speed of communication links in some edge scenarios and we\npropose three different schemes: a pure FaaS implementation, StateProp, i.e.,\npropagation of the application state throughout the entire chain of functions,\nand StateLocal, i.e., a solution where the state is kept local to the workers\nthat run functions and retrieved only as needed. We then extend the proposed\nschemes to the more general case of applications modeled as Directed Acyclic\nGraphs (DAGs), which cover a broad range of practical applications, e.g., in\nthe Internet of Things (IoT) area. Our contribution is validated via a\nprototype implementation. Experiments in emulated conditions show that applying\nthe data locality principle reduces significantly the volume of network traffic\nrequired and improves the end-to-end delay performance, especially with local\ncaching on edge nodes and low link speeds.",

To promote\nresilience, we suggest facilitating collaboration via a novel confusion-based\ncommunication protocol according to which agents broadcast observations that\nare misaligned with their previous experiences.

In this paper, we\npresent the first comprehensive empirical analysis of deep perceptual hashing\nbased on NeuralHash. Specifically, we show that current deep perceptual hashing\nmay not be robust. An adversary can manipulate the hash values by applying\nslight changes in images, either induced by gradient-based approaches or simply\nby performing standard image transformations, forcing or preventing hash\ncollisions. Such attacks permit malicious actors easily to exploit the\ndetection system: from hiding abusive material to framing innocent users,\neverything is possible. Moreover, using the hash values, inferences can still\nbe made about the data stored on user devices.

    "abstract": "This work proposes a new computational framework for learning an explicit\ngenerative model for real-world datasets. In particular we propose to learn\n{\\em a closed-loop transcription} between a multi-class multi-dimensional data\ndistribution and a { linear discriminative representation (LDR)} in the feature\nspace that consists of multiple independent multi-dimensional linear subspaces.\nIn particular, we argue that the optimal encoding and decoding mappings sought\ncan be formulated as the equilibrium point of a {\\em two-player minimax game\nbetween the encoder and decoder}. A natural utility function for this game is\nthe so-called {\\em rate reduction}, a simple information-theoretic measure for\ndistances between mixtures of subspace-like Gaussians in the feature space. Our\nformulation draws inspiration from closed-loop error feedback from control\nsystems and avoids expensive evaluating and minimizing approximated distances\nbetween arbitrary distributions in either the data space or the feature space.\nTo a large extent, this new formulation unifies the concepts and benefits of\nAuto-Encoding and GAN and naturally extends them to the settings of learning a\n{\\em both discriminative and generative} representation for multi-class and\nmulti-dimensional real-world data. Our extensive experiments on many benchmark\nimagery datasets demonstrate tremendous potential of this new closed-loop\nformulation: under fair comparison, visual quality of the learned decoder and\nclassification performance of the encoder is competitive and often better than\nexisting methods based on GAN, VAE, or a combination of both. We notice that\nthe so learned features of different classes are explicitly mapped onto\napproximately {\\em independent principal subspaces} in the feature space; and\ndiverse visual attributes within each class are modeled by the {\\em independent\nprincipal components} within each subspace.",

    "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) secures face recognition from presentation attacks\n(PAs). Existing FAS methods usually supervise PA detectors with handcrafted\nbinary or pixel-wise labels. However, handcrafted labels may are not the most\nadequate way to supervise PA detectors learning sufficient and intrinsic\nspoofing cues. Instead of using the handcrafted labels, we propose a novel\nMeta-Teacher FAS (MT-FAS) method to train a meta-teacher for supervising PA\ndetectors more effectively. The meta-teacher is trained in a bi-level\noptimization manner to learn the ability to supervise the PA detectors learning\nrich spoofing cues. The bi-level optimization contains two key components: 1) a\nlower-level training in which the meta-teacher supervises the detector's\nlearning process on the training set; and 2) a higher-level training in which\nthe meta-teacher's teaching performance is optimized by minimizing the\ndetector's validation loss. Our meta-teacher differs significantly from\nexisting teacher-student models because the meta-teacher is explicitly trained\nfor better teaching the detector (student), whereas existing teachers are\ntrained for outstanding accuracy neglecting teaching ability. Extensive\nexperiments on five FAS benchmarks show that with the proposed MT-FAS, the\ntrained meta-teacher 1) provides better-suited supervision than both\nhandcrafted labels and existing teacher-student models; and 2) significantly\nimproves the performances of PA detectors.",

    "title": "Robust and Optimal Contention Resolution without Collision Detection",
    "abstract": "We consider the classical contention resolution problem where nodes arrive\nover time, each with a message to send. In each synchronous slot, each node can\nsend or remain idle. If in a slot one node sends alone, it succeeds; otherwise,\nif multiple nodes send simultaneously, messages collide and none succeeds.\nNodes can differentiate collision and silence only if collision detection is\navailable. Ideally, a contention resolution algorithm should satisfy three\ncriteria: low time complexity (or high throughput); low energy complexity,\nmeaning each node does not make too many broadcast attempts; strong robustness,\nmeaning the algorithm can maintain good performance even if slots can be\njammed. Previous work has shown, with collision detection, there are \"perfect\"\ncontention resolution algorithms satisfying all three criteria. On the other\nhand, without collision detection, it was not until 2020 that an algorithm was\ndiscovered which can achieve optimal time complexity and low energy cost,\nassuming there is no jamming. More recently, the trade-off between throughput\nand robustness was studied. However, an intriguing and important question\nremains unknown: without collision detection, are there robust algorithms\nachieving both low total time complexity and low per-node energy cost? In this\npaper, we answer the above question affirmatively. Specifically, we develop a\nnew randomized algorithm for robust contention resolution without collision\ndetection. Lower bounds show that it has both optimal time and energy\ncomplexity. If all nodes start execution simultaneously, we design another\nalgorithm that is even faster, with similar energy complexity as the first\nalgorithm. The separation on time complexity suggests for robust contention\nresolution without collision detection, ``batch'' instances (nodes start\nsimultaneously) are inherently easier than ``scattered'' ones (nodes arrive\nover time).",

Specifically, building\non the premise of the HypRAPTOR algorithm, we first extend TBTR to its\npartitioning variant -- HypTBTR. However, the improvement in query times of\nHyTBTR over TBTR comes at the cost of increased preprocessing. To counter this\nissue, two new techniques are proposed -- a one-to-many variant of TBTR and\nmultilevel partitioning. Our accelerated one-to-many algorithm can rapidly\nsolve profile queries, which not only reduces the preprocessing time for\nHypTBTR, but can also aid other popular approaches like Scalable Transfer\nPatterns and HypRAPTOR. Additionally, we integrate the multilevel graph\npartitioning paradigm in HypTBTR and HypRAPTOR to reduce the fill-in\ncomputations. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is extensively tested on\nreal-world large-scale datasets.",

    "abstract": "Along with the progress of AI democratization, machine learning (ML) has been\nsuccessfully applied to edge applications, such as smart phones and automated\ndriving. Nowadays, more applications require ML on tiny devices with extremely\nlimited resources, like implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), which is\nknown as TinyML. Unlike ML on the edge, TinyML with a limited energy supply has\nhigher demands on low-power execution. Stochastic computing (SC) using\nbitstreams for data representation is promising for TinyML since it can perform\nthe fundamental ML operations using simple logical gates, instead of the\ncomplicated binary adder and multiplier. However, SC commonly suffers from low\naccuracy for ML tasks due to low data precision and inaccuracy of arithmetic\nunits. Increasing the length of the bitstream in the existing works can\nmitigate the precision issue but incur higher latency. In this work, we propose\na novel SC architecture, namely Block-based Stochastic Computing (BSC). BSC\ndivides inputs into blocks, such that the latency can be reduced by exploiting\nhigh data parallelism. Moreover, optimized arithmetic units and output revision\n(OUR) scheme are proposed to improve accuracy. On top of it, a global\noptimization approach is devised to determine the number of blocks, which can\nmake a better latency-power trade-off. Experimental results show that BSC can\noutperform the existing designs in achieving over 10% higher accuracy on ML\ntasks and over 6 times power reduction.",

Using this model, we find that social\nutility and equity can be simultaneously improved when vaccine access is\nprioritized for the most disadvantaged communities, which holds even when such\ncommunities manifest considerable vaccine reluctance. Nevertheless, equity\namong distinct demographic features are in tension due to their complex\ncorrelation in society.

The optical\nneural network (ONN) is a promising candidate for next-generation\nneurocomputing due to its high parallelism, low latency, and low energy\nconsumption. Here, we devise a hardware-efficient photonic subspace neural\nnetwork (PSNN) architecture, which targets lower optical component usage, area\ncost, and energy consumption than previous ONN architectures with comparable\ntask performance. Additionally, a hardware-aware training framework is provided\nto minimize the required device programming precision, lessen the chip area,\nand boost the noise robustness. We experimentally demonstrate our PSNN on a\nbutterfly-style programmable silicon photonic integrated circuit and show its\nutility in practical image recognition tasks.",

    "abstract": "Quantified responsibility ascription in complex scenarios is of crucial\nimportance in current debates regarding collective action, for example in the\nface of various environmental crises. Within this endeavor, we recently\nproposed considering a probabilistic view of causation, rather than the\ndeterministic views employed in much of the previous formal responsibility\nliterature, and presented a corresponding framework as well as initial\ncandidate functions applicable to a range of scenarios. In the current paper,\nwe extend this contribution by formally evaluating the qualities of proposed\nfunctions through an axiomatic approach. First, we decompose responsibility\nascription into distinct contributing functions, before defining a number of\ndesirable properties, or axioms, for these. Afterwards we evaluate the proposed\nfunctions regarding compliance with these axioms. We find an incompatibility\nbetween axioms determining upper and lower bounds in one of the contributing\nfunctions, imposing a choice for one variant - upper bound or lower bound. For\nthe other contributing function we are able to axiomatically characterize one\nspecific function. As the previously mentioned incompatibility extends to the\ncombined responsibility function we finally present maximally axiom compliant\ncombined functions for each variant - including the upper bound axiom or\nincluding the lower bound axiom.",

We distinguish between the cases that the master stability\nfunction is negative in either a bounded or an unbounded range of its argument.\nFor CS, each cluster may be stable independent of the others, which indicates\nthat the range of a given parameter that synchronizes the cluster may be\ndifferent for different clusters (isolated CS.) For each pair of clusters, we\ndistinguish between three different cases: Matryoshka Cluster Synchronization\n(when the range of stability for one cluster is included in that of the other\ncluster), Partially Disjoint Cluster Synchronization (when the ranges of\nstability partially overlap), and Complete Disjoint Cluster Synchronization\n(when the ranges of stability do not overlap.) Among these cases, only the case\nof Matryoshka synchronization had been previously reported.

    "abstract": "Prompt tuning (PT) is a promising parameter-efficient method to utilize\nextremely large pre-trained language models (PLMs), which could achieve\ncomparable performance to full-parameter fine-tuning by only tuning a few soft\nprompts. However, compared to fine-tuning, PT empirically requires much more\ntraining steps. To explore whether we can improve the efficiency of PT by\nreusing trained soft prompts and sharing learned knowledge, we empirically\ninvestigate the transferability of soft prompts across different tasks and\nmodels. In cross-task transfer, we find that trained soft prompts can well\ntransfer to similar tasks and initialize PT for them to accelerate training and\nimprove performance. Moreover, to explore what factors influence prompts'\ntransferability across tasks, we investigate how to measure the prompt\nsimilarity and find that the overlapping rate of activated neurons highly\ncorrelates to the transferability. In cross-model transfer, we explore how to\nproject the prompts of a PLM to another PLM and successfully train a kind of\nprojector which can achieve non-trivial transfer performance on similar tasks.\nHowever, initializing PT with the projected prompts does not work well, which\nmay be caused by optimization preferences and PLMs' high redundancy.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed that neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has\nadvantages over conventional algorithms in many combinatorial optimization\nproblems such as routing, but it is less efficient for more complicated\noptimization tasks such as packing which involves mutually conditioned action\nspaces. In this paper, we propose a Recurrent Conditional Query Learning (RCQL)\nmethod to solve both 2D and 3D packing problems. We first embed states by a\nrecurrent encoder, and then adopt attention with conditional queries from\nprevious actions. The conditional query mechanism fills the information gap\nbetween learning steps, which shapes the problem as a Markov decision process.\nBenefiting from the recurrence, a single RCQL model is capable of handling\ndifferent sizes of packing problems. Experiment results show that RCQL can\neffectively learn strong heuristics for offline and online strip packing\nproblems (SPPs), outperforming a wide range of baselines in space utilization\nratio. RCQL reduces the average bin gap ratio by 1.83% in offline 2D 40-box\ncases and 7.84% in 3D cases compared with state-of-the-art methods.

To date, realizations of large-scale CIMs have\nbeen demonstrated using hybrid optical-electronic setups, where optical\noscillators simulating different spins are subject to electronic feedback\nmechanisms emulating their mutual interaction. While the optical evolution\nensures an ultrafast computation, the electronic coupling represents a\nbottleneck that causes the computational time to severely depend on the system\nsize. Here, we propose an all-optical scalable CIM with fully-programmable\ncoupling. Our setup consists of an optical parametric amplifier with a spatial\nlight modulator (SLM) within the parametric cavity. The spin variables are\nencoded in the binary phases of the optical wavefront of the signal beam at\ndifferent spatial points, defined by the pixels of the SLM. We first discuss\nhow different coupling topologies can be achieved by different configurations\nof the SLM, and then benchmark our setup with a numerical simulation that\nmimics the dynamics of the proposed machine.

One of their successes is the skill in\nprediction of future dynamics given a suitable training set of data. Previous\nstudies have shown how Echo State Networks (ESNs), a subset of Recurrent Neural\nNetworks, can successfully predict even chaotic systems for times longer than\nthe Lyapunov time. This study shows that, remarkably, ESNs can successfully\npredict dynamical behavior that is qualitatively different from any behavior\ncontained in the training set. Evidence is provided for a fluid dynamics\nproblem where the flow can transition between laminar (ordered) and turbulent\n(disordered) regimes. Despite being trained on the turbulent regime only, ESNs\nare found to predict laminar behavior. Moreover, the statistics of\nturbulent-to-laminar and laminar-to-turbulent transitions are also predicted\nsuccessfully, and the utility of ESNs in acting as an early-warning system for\ntransition is discussed. These results are expected to be widely applicable to\ndata-driven modelling of temporal behaviour in a range of physical, climate,\nbiological, ecological and finance models characterized by the presence of\ntipping points and sudden transitions between several competing states.",

As such,\nthese methods suffer from either a large bias in the presence of unmeasured\nconfounders, or a large variance in settings with continuous or large\nobservation/state spaces. In this work, we first propose novel identification\nmethods for OPE in POMDPs with latent confounders, by introducing bridge\nfunctions that link the target policy's value and the observed data\ndistribution. In fully-observable MDPs, these bridge functions reduce to the\nfamiliar value functions and marginal density ratios between the evaluation and\nthe behavior policies. We next propose minimax estimation methods for learning\nthese bridge functions. Our proposal permits general function approximation and\nis thus applicable to settings with continuous or large observation/state\nspaces. Finally, we construct three estimators based on these estimated bridge\nfunctions, corresponding to a value function-based estimator, a marginalized\nimportance sampling estimator, and a doubly-robust estimator.

By contrast, psychological and\nneuroscientific investigations into decision making under risk have utilized a\nvariety of more venerable theoretical models such as prospect theory that lack\naxiomatically desirable properties such as coherence.

We first adopt a conventional\ndistributional approach to CVaR in a sequential setting and reanalyze the\nchoices of human decision-makers in the well-known two-step task, revealing\nsubstantial risk aversion that had been lurking under stickiness and\nperseveration. We then consider a further critical property of risk\nsensitivity, namely time consistency, showing alternatives to this form of CVaR\nthat enjoy this desirable characteristic.

Our main concern is first-order rewritability of ontology-mediated\nqueries (OMQs) that consist of a 2D ontology and a positive temporal instance\nquery. Our target languages for FO-rewritings are two-sorted FO(<) -\nfirst-order logic with sorts for time instants ordered by the built-in\nprecedence relation < and for the domain of individuals - its extension FOE\nwith the standard congruence predicates t \\equiv 0 mod n, for any fixed n > 1,\nand FO(RPR) that admits relational primitive recursion. In terms of circuit\ncomplexity, FOE- and FO(RPR)-rewritability guarantee answering OMQs in uniform\nAC0 and NC1, respectively.\nWe proceed in three steps. First, we define a hierarchy of 2D DL-Lite/LTL\nontology languages and investigate the FO-rewritability of OMQs with atomic\nqueries by constructing projections onto 1D LTL OMQs and employing recent\nresults on the FO-rewritability of propositional LTL OMQs. As the projections\ninvolve deciding consistency of ontologies and data, we also consider the\nconsistency problem for our languages. While the undecidability of consistency\nfor 2D ontology languages with expressive Boolean role inclusions might be\nexpected, we also show that, rather surprisingly, the restriction to Krom and\nHorn role inclusions leads to decidability (and ExpSpace-completeness), even if\none admits full Booleans on concepts. As a final step, we lift some of the\nrewritability results for atomic OMQs to OMQs with expressive positive temporal\ninstance queries.

    "abstract": "Simulators make unique benchmarks for causal effect estimation since they do\nnot rely on unverifiable assumptions or the ability to intervene on real-world\nsystems, but are often too simple to capture important aspects of real\napplications. We propose a simulator of Alzheimer's disease aimed at modeling\nintricacies of healthcare data while enabling benchmarking of causal effect and\npolicy estimators. We fit the system to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ADNI) dataset and ground hand-crafted components in results from\ncomparative treatment trials and observational treatment patterns. The\nsimulator includes parameters which alter the nature and difficulty of the\ncausal inference tasks, such as latent variables, effect heterogeneity, length\nof observed history, behavior policy and sample size. We use the simulator to\ncompare estimators of average and conditional treatment effects.",

    "abstract": "Buildings' segmentation is a fundamental task in the field of earth\nobservation and aerial imagery analysis. Most existing deep learning based\nalgorithms in the literature can be applied on fixed or narrow-ranged spatial\nresolution imagery. In practical scenarios, users deal with a wide spectrum of\nimages resolution and thus, often need to resample a given aerial image to\nmatch the spatial resolution of the dataset used to train the deep learning\nmodel. This however, would result in a severe degradation in the quality of the\noutput segmentation masks. To deal with this issue, we propose in this research\na Scale-invariant neural network (Sci-Net) that is able to segment buildings\npresent in aerial images at different spatial resolutions. Specifically, we\nmodified the U-Net architecture and fused it with dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid\nPooling (ASPP) to extract fine-grained multi-scale representations. We compared\nthe performance of our proposed model against several state of the art models\non the Open Cities AI dataset, and showed that Sci-Net provides a steady\nimprovement margin in performance across all resolutions available in the\ndataset.",

However, non-separable costs, which depend on\nthe choices of all players instead of only those choosing the same resource,\nmay be relevant in some circumstances, like in smart charging games. In this\npaper, finite congestion games with non-separable costs are shown to have an\nordinal potential function, leading to the existence of an action-dependent\ncontinuous potential function. The convergence of a synchronous RLA towards the\npure NE is then extended to this more general class of congestion games.\nFinally, a smart charging game is designed for illustrating convergence of such\nlearning algorithms.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the (block-angular) min-max resource sharing problem, which is a\nwell-known generalization of fractional packing and the maximum concurrent flow\nproblem. It consists of finding an $\\ell_{\\infty}$-minimal element in a\nMinkowski sum $\\mathcal{X}= \\sum_{C \\in \\mathcal{C}} X_C$ of non-empty closed\nconvex sets $X_C \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{R}}_{\\geq 0}$, where\n$\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{R}$ are finite sets. We assume that an oracle for\napproximate linear minimization over $X_C$ is given. In this setting, the\ncurrently fastest known FPTAS is due to M\\\"uller, Radke, and Vygen. For $\\delta\n\\in (0,1]$, it computes a $\\sigma(1+\\delta)$-approximately optimal solution\nusing $\\mathcal{O}((|\\mathcal{C}|+|\\mathcal{R}|)\\log |\\mathcal{R}| (\\delta^{-2}\n+ \\log \\log |\\mathcal{R}|))$ oracle calls, where $\\sigma$ is the approximation\nratio of the oracle.

The whole process is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to\nerrors. Automation can optimize and facilitate such labor-intensive and human\nerror-prone processes. With the recent advances in the fields of artificial\nintelligence and computer vision, automatic meter reading systems are becoming\nmore viable than ever. Motivated by the recent advances in the field of\nartificial intelligence and inspired by open-source open-access initiatives in\nthe research community, we introduce a novel large benchmark dataset of\nreal-life gas meter images, named the NRC-GAMMA dataset.

Yet, challenging\nacquisition scenarios and tiny animal depictions in airborne imagery, despite\nultra-high resolution cameras, have so far been limiting factors for applying\ncomputer vision detectors successfully with high confidence. In this paper, we\naddress the problem for the first time by combining deep object detectors with\nsuper-resolution techniques and altitude data. In particular, we show that the\nintegration of a holistic attention network based super-resolution approach and\na custom-built altitude data exploitation network into standard recognition\npipelines can considerably increase the detection efficacy in real-world\nsettings. We evaluate the system on two public, large aerial-capture animal\ndatasets, SAVMAP and AED.

At present, farmers often over-apply N fertilizer in some locations or\ntimepoints because they do not have high-resolution crop N status data. N-use\nefficiency can be low, with the remaining N lost to the environment, resulting\nin high production costs and environmental pollution. Accurate and timely\nestimation of N status in crops is crucial to improving cropping systems'\neconomic and environmental sustainability. The conventional approaches based on\ntissue analysis in the laboratory for estimating N status in plants are time\nconsuming and destructive. Recent advances in remote sensing and machine\nlearning have shown promise in addressing the aforementioned challenges in a\nnon-destructive way. We propose a novel deep learning framework: a\nchannel-spatial attention-based vision transformer (CSVT) for estimating crop N\nstatus from large images collected from a UAV in a wheat field. Unlike the\nexisting works, the proposed CSVT introduces a Channel Attention Block (CAB)\nand a Spatial Interaction Block (SIB), which allows capturing nonlinear\ncharacteristics of spatial-wise and channel-wise features from UAV digital\naerial imagery, for accurate N status prediction in wheat crops. Moreover,\nsince acquiring labeled data is time consuming and costly, local-to-global\nself-supervised learning is introduced to pre-train the CSVT with extensive\nunlabelled data. The proposed CSVT has been compared with the state-of-the-art\nmodels, tested and validated on both testing and independent datasets.

However, their\ntraditional get/put interface is unable to exploit data locality at its\nfullest, and limits reaching its peak performance. In particular, there is one\nway to improve data locality that has not yet achieved mainstream adoption: the\nactive object store. Although there are some projects that have implemented the\nmain idea of the active object store such as Swift's Storlets or Ceph Object\nClasses, the scope of these implementations is limited.\nWe believe that there is a huge potential for active object stores in the\ncurrent status quo. Hyper-converged nodes are bringing more computing\ncapabilities to storage nodes --and viceversa. The proliferation of\nnon-volatile memory (NVM) technology is blurring the line between system memory\n(fast and scarce) and block devices (slow and abundant). More and more\napplications need to manage a sheer amount of data (data analytics, Big Data,\nMachine Learning & AI, etc.), demanding bigger clusters and more complex\ncomputations. All these elements are potential game changers that need to be\nevaluated in the scope of active object stores.\nIn this article we propose an active object store software stack and evaluate\nit on an NVM-populated node. We will show how this setup is able to reduce\nexecution times from 10% up to more than 90% in a variety of representative\napplication scenarios. Our discussion will focus on the active aspect of the\nsystem as well as on the implications of the memory configuration.",

    "title": "Time in a Box: Advancing Knowledge Graph Completion with Temporal Scopes",
    "abstract": "Almost all statements in knowledge bases have a temporal scope during which\nthey are valid. Hence, knowledge base completion (KBC) on temporal knowledge\nbases (TKB), where each statement \\textit{may} be associated with a temporal\nscope, has attracted growing attention. Prior works assume that each statement\nin a TKB \\textit{must} be associated with a temporal scope. This ignores the\nfact that the scoping information is commonly missing in a KB. Thus prior work\nis typically incapable of handling generic use cases where a TKB is composed of\ntemporal statements with/without a known temporal scope. In order to address\nthis issue, we establish a new knowledge base embedding framework, called\nTIME2BOX, that can deal with atemporal and temporal statements of different\ntypes simultaneously. Our main insight is that answers to a temporal query\nalways belong to a subset of answers to a time-agnostic counterpart. Put\ndifferently, time is a filter that helps pick out answers to be correct during\ncertain periods. We introduce boxes to represent a set of answer entities to a\ntime-agnostic query. The filtering functionality of time is modeled by\nintersections over these boxes. In addition, we generalize current evaluation\nprotocols on time interval prediction. We describe experiments on two datasets\nand show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods\non both link prediction and time prediction.",

    "title": "Approximate Membership Query Filters with a False Positive Free Set",
    "abstract": "In the last decade, significant efforts have been made to reduce the false\npositive rate of approximate membership checking structures. This has led to\nthe development of new structures such as cuckoo filters and xor filters.\nAdaptive filters that can react to false positives as they occur to avoid them\nfor future queries to the same elements have also been recently developed. In\nthis paper, we propose a new type of static filters that completely avoid false\npositives for a given set of negative elements and show how they can be\nefficiently implemented using xor probing filters. Several constructions of\nthese filters with a false positive free set are proposed that minimize the\nmemory and speed overheads introduced by avoiding false positives. The proposed\nfilters have been extensively evaluated to validate their functionality and\nshow that in many cases both the memory and speed overheads are negligible. We\nalso discuss several use cases to illustrate the potential benefits of the\nproposed filters in practical applications.",

Here, we propose on-chip training of neural\nnetworks enabled by a CMOS-compatible silicon photonic architecture to harness\nthe potential for massively parallel, efficient, and fast data operations. Our\nscheme employs the direct feedback alignment training algorithm, which trains\nneural networks using error feedback rather than error backpropagation, and can\noperate at speeds of trillions of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations per\nsecond while consuming less than one picojoule per MAC operation. The photonic\narchitecture exploits parallelized matrix-vector multiplications using arrays\nof microring resonators for processing multi-channel analog signals along\nsingle waveguide buses to calculate the gradient vector of each neural network\nlayer in situ, which is the most computationally expensive operation performed\nduring the backward pass.

    "title": "Hierarchical Clustering: New Bounds and Objective",
    "abstract": "Hierarchical Clustering has been studied and used extensively as a method for\nanalysis of data. More recently, Dasgupta [2016] defined a precise objective\nfunction. Given a set of $n$ data points with a weight function $w_{i,j}$ for\neach two items $i$ and $j$ denoting their similarity/dis-similarity, the goal\nis to build a recursive (tree like) partitioning of the data points (items)\ninto successively smaller clusters. He defined a cost function for a tree $T$\nto be $Cost(T) = \\sum_{i,j \\in [n]} \\big(w_{i,j} \\times |T_{i,j}| \\big)$ where\n$T_{i,j}$ is the subtree rooted at the least common ancestor of $i$ and $j$ and\npresented the first approximation algorithm for such clustering. Then Moseley\nand Wang [2017] considered the dual of Dasgupta's objective function for\nsimilarity-based weights and showed that both random partitioning and average\nlinkage have approximation ratio $1/3$ which has been improved in a series of\nworks to $0.585$ [Alon et al. 2020]. Later Cohen-Addad et al. [2019] considered\nthe same objective function as Dasgupta's but for dissimilarity-based metrics,\ncalled $Rev(T)$. It is shown that both random partitioning and average linkage\nhave ratio $2/3$ which has been only slightly improved to $0.667078$ [Charikar\net al. SODA2020]. Our first main result is to consider $Rev(T)$ and present a\nmore delicate algorithm and careful analysis that achieves approximation\n$0.71604$. We also introduce a new objective function for dissimilarity-based\nclustering. For any tree $T$, let $H_{i,j}$ be the number of $i$ and $j$'s\ncommon ancestors. Intuitively, items that are similar are expected to remain\nwithin the same cluster as deep as possible. So, for dissimilarity-based\nmetrics, we suggest the cost of each tree $T$, which we want to minimize, to be\n$Cost_H(T) = \\sum_{i,j \\in [n]} \\big(w_{i,j} \\times H_{i,j} \\big)$.

Users control infinitesimal flow particles aiming to\ntravel from a source to destination as quickly as possible. Flow patterns vary\nover time, and congestion effects are modeled via queues, which form whenever\nthe inflow into a link exceeds its capacity. Despite lots of interest, some\nvery basic questions remain open in this model. We resolve a number of them:\n- We show uniqueness of journey times in equilibria.\n- We show continuity of equilibria: small perturbations to the instance or to\nthe traffic situation at some moment cannot lead to wildly different\nequilibrium evolutions.\n- We demonstrate that, assuming constant inflow into the network at the\nsource, equilibria always settle down into a \"steady state\" in which the\nbehavior extends forever in a linear fashion.\nOne of our main conceptual contributions is to show that the answer to the\nfirst two questions, on uniqueness and continuity, are intimately connected to\nthe third. Our result also shows very clearly that resolving uniqueness and\ncontinuity, despite initial appearances, cannot be resolved by analytic\ntechniques, but are related to very combinatorial aspects of the model. To\nresolve the third question, we substantially extend the approach of Cominetti\net al., who show a steady-state result in the regime where the input flow rate\nis smaller than the network capacity.",

We also investigate a\nnovel synthetic augmentation framework that selectively adds new synthetic\nimage patches generated by our proposed HistoGAN, rather than expanding\ndirectly the training set with synthetic images. By selecting synthetic images\nbased on the confidence of their assigned labels and their feature similarity\nto real labeled images, our framework provides quality assurance to synthetic\naugmentation. Our models are evaluated on two datasets: a cervical\nhistopathology image dataset with limited annotations, and another dataset of\nlymph node histopathology images with metastatic cancer.

Until\nrecently with the introduction of mean-field games to the controls community,\nthere has not been a rigorous framework to facilitate passage between controls\nfor the microscopic models and the macroscopic models. We begin this work with\na particle-based model of autonomous vehicles subject to drag and unknown\ndisturbances, noise, and a speed limit in addition to the control.\nWe formulate a robust stochastic differential game on the particles. We pass\nformally to the infinite-particle limit to obtain a robust mean-field game PDE\nsystem. We solve the mean-field game PDE system numerically and discuss the\nresults. In particular, we obtain an optimal control which increases the bulk\nvelocity of the traffic flow while reducing congestion.",

    "abstract": "Quantum technologies currently struggle to scale beyond moderate scale\nprototypes and are unable to execute even reasonably sized programs due to\nprohibitive gate error rates or coherence times. Many software approaches rely\non heavy compiler optimization to squeeze extra value from noisy machines but\nare fundamentally limited by hardware. Alone, these software approaches help to\nmaximize the use of available hardware but cannot overcome the inherent\nlimitations posed by the underlying technology. An alternative approach is to\nexplore the use of new, though potentially less developed, technology as a path\ntowards scalability. In this work we evaluate the advantages and disadvantages\nof a Neutral Atom (NA) architecture. NA systems offer several promising\nadvantages such as long range interactions and native multiqubit gates which\nreduce communication overhead, overall gate count, and depth for compiled\nprograms. Long range interactions, however, impede parallelism with restriction\nzones surrounding interacting qubit pairs. We extend current compiler methods\nto maximize the benefit of these advantages and minimize the cost. Furthermore,\natoms in an NA device have the possibility to randomly be lost over the course\nof program execution which is extremely detrimental to total program execution\ntime as atom arrays are slow to load. When the compiled program is no longer\ncompatible with the underlying topology, we need a fast and efficient coping\nmechanism. We propose hardware and compiler methods to increase system\nresilience to atom loss dramatically reducing total computation time by\ncircumventing complete reloads or full recompilation every cycle.",

Partly for the simplicity's sake, many studies have focused on\ntheir projection onto their unipartite versions where one only needs to care\nabout a single type of nodes. When it comes to mesoscale structures such as\ncommunities, however, it is ever more important to properly incorporate a\npriori structural restrictions such as bipartivity. In this paper, as a case\nstudy, we take the community structure of bipartite networks in various scales\nto examine the amount of information of bipartivity encoded in the community\ndetection procedure. In particular, we report the robustness in reliability of\ndetected community based on consistency by comparing the detection algorithm\nwith or without the consideration of bipartivity. From the analysis with model\nnetworks embedding prescribed communities and real networks, we find that the\ncommunity detection tailored to take the bipartivity into account clearly\nyields more robust community structures than the one without utilizing such\nstructural information. Therefore, it demonstrates the necessity for\ncustomizing the community detection algorithm encoding whatever information\nknown about networks of interest, and at the same time it raises an interesting\nquestion on the possibility of estimating the quantitative amount of\ninformation from such customization.",

The\ncovariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution is weighted with a latent scale\nparameter, which is also a random variable, resulting in the stochastic\nfluctuations of covariances.

    "abstract": "To develop a sound-monitoring system for machines, a method for detecting\nanomalous sound under domain shifts is proposed. A domain shift occurs when a\nmachine's physical parameters change. Because a domain shift changes the\ndistribution of normal sound data, conventional unsupervised anomaly detection\nmethods can output false positives. To solve this problem, the proposed method\nconstrains some latent variables of a normalizing flows (NF) model to represent\nphysical parameters, which enables disentanglement of the factors of domain\nshifts and learning of a latent space that is invariant with respect to these\ndomain shifts. Anomaly scores calculated from this domain-shift-invariant\nlatent space are unaffected by such shifts, which reduces false positives and\nimproves the detection performance. Experiments were conducted with sound data\nfrom a slide rail under different operation velocities. The results show that\nthe proposed method disentangled the velocity to obtain a latent space that was\ninvariant with respect to domain shifts, which improved the AUC by 13.2% for\nGlow with a single block and 2.6% for Glow with multiple blocks.",

Our framework, which we call High-dimensional Propose-Test-Release\n(HPTR), builds upon three crucial components: the exponential mechanism, robust\nstatistics, and the Propose-Test-Release mechanism. Gluing all these together\nis the concept of resilience, which is central to robust statistical\nestimation. Resilience guides the design of the algorithm, the sensitivity\nanalysis, and the success probability analysis of the test step in\nPropose-Test-Release. The key insight is that if we design an exponential\nmechanism that accesses the data only via one-dimensional robust statistics,\nthen the resulting local sensitivity can be dramatically reduced. Using\nresilience, we can provide tight local sensitivity bounds. These tight bounds\nreadily translate into near-optimal utility guarantees in several cases. We\ngive a general recipe for applying HPTR to a given instance of a statistical\nestimation problem and demonstrate it on canonical problems of mean estimation,\nlinear regression, covariance estimation, and principal component analysis.

We characterize the coupling as a generalized encoding process, where\nthe system acts as an information thermodynamics encoder to encode the external\ninformation based on thermodynamics. We formalize the encoding process in the\ncontext of the nonequilibrium second law of thermodynamics, revealing an\nintrinsic difference in information thermodynamics characteristics between\ninformation thermodynamics encoders with and without internal correlations.\nDuring the information encoding process of an external source $\\mathsf{Y}$,\nspecific sub-systems in an encoder $\\mathsf{X}$ with internal correlations can\nexceed the information thermodynamics bound on\n$\\left(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y}\\right)$ and encode more information than system\n$\\mathsf{X}$ works as a whole.

In recent years, there have been tremendous improvements in\narchitecture design, resulting in better performance on various prediction\ntasks. In general, these neural architectures combine node feature aggregation\nand feature transformation using learnable weight matrix in the same layer.\nThis makes it challenging to analyze the importance of node features aggregated\nfrom various hops and the expressiveness of the neural network layers. As\ndifferent graph datasets show varying levels of homophily and heterophily in\nfeatures and class label distribution, it becomes essential to understand which\nfeatures are important for the prediction tasks without any prior information.\nIn this work, we decouple the node feature aggregation step and depth of graph\nneural network, and empirically analyze how different aggregated features play\na role in prediction performance. We show that not all features generated via\naggregation steps are useful, and often using these less informative features\ncan be detrimental to the performance of the GNN model. Through our\nexperiments, we show that learning certain subsets of these features can lead\nto better performance on wide variety of datasets. We propose to use softmax as\na regularizer and \"soft-selector\" of features aggregated from neighbors at\ndifferent hop distances; and L2-Normalization over GNN layers. Combining these\ntechniques, we present a simple and shallow model, Feature Selection Graph\nNeural Network (FSGNN), and show empirically that the proposed model achieves\ncomparable or even higher accuracy than state-of-the-art GNN models in nine\nbenchmark datasets for the node classification task, with remarkable\nimprovements up to 51.1%.",

    "title": "The Time-Freezing Reformulation for Numerical Optimal Control of  Complementarity Lagrangian Systems with State Jumps",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel reformulation and numerical methods for optimal\ncontrol of complementarity Lagrangian systems with state jumps. The solutions\nof the reformulated system have jump discontinuities in the first time\nderivative instead of the trajectory itself, which is easier to handle\ntheoretically and numerically. We cover not only the easier case of elastic\nimpacts, but also the difficult case, when after the state jump the system\nevolves on the boundary of the dynamic's feasible set. In nonsmooth mechanics\nthis corresponds to inelastic impacts. The main idea of the time-freezing\nreformulation is to introduce a clock state and an auxiliary dynamic system\nwhose trajectory endpoints satisfy the state jump law. When the auxiliary\nsystem is active, the clock state is not evolving, hence by taking only the\nparts of the trajectory when the clock state was active, we can recover the\noriginal solution. %Formally, we transform Dynamic Complementarity Systems\n(DCS) with relative degree two into Piecewise Smooth Systems (PSS). For\ncomputational convenience, the resulting PSS can be transformed into an DCS\nwith relative degree one, whose solution does not have state jumps. We detail\nhow to recover the solution of the original system, show how to select\nappropriate auxiliary dynamics and give practical numerical methods to handle\ndiscontinuous ODEs with nonunique sliding motions. Moreover, we introduce a\nnovel auxiliary ODE for time-freezing for elastic impacts and overcome some\ndrawbacks of [22]. The theoretical findings are illustrated on the nontrivial\nnumerical optimal control example of a hopping one-legged robot.",

    "abstract": "Computational protein design, i.e. inferring novel and diverse protein\nsequences consistent with a given structure, remains a major unsolved\nchallenge. Recently, deep generative models that learn from sequences alone or\nfrom sequences and structures jointly have shown impressive performance on this\ntask. However, those models appear limited in terms of modeling structural\nconstraints, capturing enough sequence diversity, or both. Here we consider\nthree recently proposed deep generative frameworks for protein design: (AR) the\nsequence-based autoregressive generative model, (GVP) the precise\nstructure-based graph neural network, and Fold2Seq that leverages a fuzzy and\nscale-free representation of a three-dimensional fold, while enforcing\nstructure-to-sequence (and vice versa) consistency. We benchmark these models\non the task of computational design of antibody sequences, which demand\ndesigning sequences with high diversity for functional implication. The\nFold2Seq framework outperforms the two other baselines in terms of diversity of\nthe designed sequences, while maintaining the typical fold.",

    "abstract": "Given a graph $G$ of degree $k$ over $n$ vertices, we consider the problem of\ncomputing a near maximum cut or a near minimum bisection in polynomial time.\nFor graphs of girth $L$, we develop a local message passing algorithm whose\ncomplexity is $O(nkL)$, and that achieves near optimal cut values among all\n$L$-local algorithms. Focusing on max-cut, the algorithm constructs a cut of\nvalue $nk/4+ n\\mathsf{P}_\\star\\sqrt{k/4}+\\mathsf{err}(n,k,L)$, where\n$\\mathsf{P}_\\star\\approx 0.763166$ is the value of the Parisi formula from spin\nglass theory, and $\\mathsf{err}(n,k,L)=o_n(n)+no_k(\\sqrt{k})+n \\sqrt{k} o_L(1)$\n(subscripts indicate the asymptotic variables). Our result generalizes to\nlocally treelike graphs, i.e., graphs whose girth becomes $L$ after removing a\nsmall fraction of vertices.\nEarlier work established that, for random $k$-regular graphs, the typical\nmax-cut value is $nk/4+ n\\mathsf{P}_\\star\\sqrt{k/4}+o_n(n)+no_k(\\sqrt{k})$.\nTherefore our algorithm is nearly optimal on such graphs. An immediate\ncorollary of this result is that random regular graphs have nearly minimum\nmax-cut, and nearly maximum min-bisection among all regular locally treelike\ngraphs. This can be viewed as a combinatorial version of the near-Ramanujan\nproperty of random regular graphs.",

    "title": "Alleviating the transit timing variation bias in transit surveys. I.  RIVERS: Method and detection of a pair of resonant super-Earths around  Kepler-1705",
    "abstract": "Transit timing variations (TTVs) can provide useful information for systems\nobserved by transit, as they allow us to put constraints on the masses and\neccentricities of the observed planets, or even to constrain the existence of\nnon-transiting companions. However, TTVs can also act as a detection bias that\ncan prevent the detection of small planets in transit surveys that would\notherwise be detected by standard algorithms such as the Boxed Least Square\nalgorithm (BLS) if their orbit was not perturbed. This bias is especially\npresent for surveys with a long baseline, such as Kepler, some of the TESS\nsectors, and the upcoming PLATO mission. Here we introduce a detection method\nthat is robust to large TTVs, and illustrate its use by recovering and\nconfirming a pair of resonant super-Earths with ten-hour TTVs around\nKepler-1705. The method is based on a neural network trained to recover the\ntracks of low-signal-to-noise-ratio(S/N) perturbed planets in river diagrams.\nWe recover the transit parameters of these candidates by fitting the light\ncurve. The individual transit S/N of Kepler-1705b and c are about three times\nlower than all the previously known planets with TTVs of 3 hours or more,\npushing the boundaries in the recovery of these small, dynamically active\nplanets. Recovering this type of object is essential for obtaining a complete\npicture of the observed planetary systems, and solving for a bias not often\ntaken into account in statistical studies of exoplanet populations. In\naddition, TTVs are a means of obtaining mass estimates which can be essential\nfor studying the internal structure of planets discovered by transit surveys.\nFinally, we show that due to the strong orbital perturbations, it is possible\nthat the spin of the outer resonant planet of Kepler-1705 is trapped in a sub-\nor super-synchronous spin-orbit resonance.",

By analyzing metric\ndistortion and curvature of shapes as elements of Lie groups in a consistent\nRiemannian setting, we construct a framework that reliably handles large\ndeformations. Due to the explicit character of Lie group operations, our\nnon-Euclidean method is very efficient allowing for fast and numerically robust\nprocessing. This facilitates Riemannian analysis of large shape populations\naccessible through longitudinal and multi-site imaging studies providing\nincreased statistical power. Additionally, as planar configurations form a\nsubmanifold in shape space, our representation allows for effective estimation\nof quasi-isometric surfaces flattenings.

In the past\nfew years, multiple theoretical and numerical advances have continuously pushed\nthe boundary of what is classically simulable, hence the development of a\nplethora of tools which are often limited to a specific purpose or designed for\na particular hardware (e.g. CPUs vs. GPUs). Moreover, such tools are typically\ndeveloped using tailored languages and syntax, which makes it hard to compare\nresults from, and create hybrid approaches using, different simulation\ntechniques.\nTo support unified and optimized use of these techniques across platforms, we\ndeveloped HybridQ, a highly extensible platform designed to provide a common\nframework to integrate multiple state-of-the-art techniques to run on a variety\nof hardware. The philosophy behind its development has been driven by three\nmain pillars: \"Easy to Use\", \"Easy to Extend\", and \"Use the Best Available\nTechnology\". The powerful tools of HybridQ allow users to manipulate, develop,\nand extend noiseless and noisy circuits for different hardware architectures.\nHybridQ supports large-scale high-performance computing (HPC) simulations,\nautomatically balancing workload among different processor nodes and enabling\nthe use of multiple backends to maximize parallel efficiency.
