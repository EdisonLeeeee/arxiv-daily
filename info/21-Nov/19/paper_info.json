    "title": "Transformation of Node to Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Faster Link  Prediction in Social Networks",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in neural networks have solved common graph problems such as\nlink prediction, node classification, node clustering, node recommendation by\ndeveloping embeddings of entities and relations into vector spaces. Graph\nembeddings encode the structural information present in a graph. The encoded\nembeddings then can be used to predict the missing links in a graph. However,\nobtaining the optimal embeddings for a graph can be a computationally\nchallenging task specially in an embedded system. Two techniques which we focus\non in this work are 1) node embeddings from random walk based methods and 2)\nknowledge graph embeddings. Random walk based embeddings are computationally\ninexpensive to obtain but are sub-optimal whereas knowledge graph embeddings\nperform better but are computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate\na transformation model which converts node embeddings obtained from random walk\nbased methods to embeddings obtained from knowledge graph methods directly\nwithout an increase in the computational cost. Extensive experimentation shows\nthat the proposed transformation model can be used for solving link prediction\nin real-time.",

    "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries are powering the ongoing transportation electrification\nrevolution. Lithium-ion batteries possess higher energy density and favourable\nelectrochemical properties which make it a preferable energy source for\nelectric vehicles. Precise estimation of battery parameters (Charge capacity,\nvoltage etc) is vital to estimate the available range in an electric vehicle.\nGraph-based estimation techniques enable us to understand the variable\ndependencies underpinning them to improve estimates. In this paper we employ\nGraph Neural Networks for battery parameter estimation, we introduce a unique\ngraph autoencoder time series estimation approach. Variables in battery\nmeasurements are known to have an underlying relationship with each other in a\ncertain correlation within variables of interest. We use graph autoencoder\nbased on a non-linear version of NOTEARS as this allowed us to perform\ngradient-descent in learning the structure (instead of treating it as a\ncombinatorial optimisation problem). The proposed architecture outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art Graph Time Series (GTS) architecture for battery parameter\nestimation. We call our method GAETS (Graph AutoEncoder Time Series).",

    "abstract": "Temporally consistent depth estimation is crucial for real-time applications\nsuch as augmented reality. While stereo depth estimation has received\nsubstantial attention that led to improvements on a frame-by-frame basis, there\nis relatively little work focused on maintaining temporal consistency across\nframes. Indeed, based on our analysis, current stereo depth estimation\ntechniques still suffer from poor temporal consistency. Stabilizing depth\ntemporally in dynamic scenes is challenging due to concurrent object and camera\nmotion. In an online setting, this process is further aggravated because only\npast frames are available. In this paper, we present a technique to produce\ntemporally consistent depth estimates in dynamic scenes in an online setting.\nOur network augments current per-frame stereo networks with novel motion and\nfusion networks. The motion network accounts for both object and camera motion\nby predicting a per-pixel SE3 transformation. The fusion network improves\nconsistency in prediction by aggregating the current and previous predictions\nwith regressed weights. We conduct extensive experiments across varied datasets\n(synthetic, outdoor, indoor and medical). In both zero-shot generalization and\ndomain fine-tuning, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms\ncompeting methods in terms of temporal stability and per-frame accuracy, both\nquantitatively and qualitatively.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we formulate and solve the intermittent deployment problem,\nwhich yields strategies that couple \\emph{when} heterogeneous robots should\nsense an environmental process, with where a deployed team should sense in the\nenvironment. As a motivation, suppose that a spatiotemporal process is slowly\nevolving and must be monitored by a multi-robot team, e.g., unmanned aerial\nvehicles monitoring pasturelands in a precision agriculture context. In such a\ncase, an intermittent deployment strategy is necessary as persistent deployment\nor monitoring is not cost-efficient for a slowly evolving process. At the same\ntime, the problem of where to sense once deployed must be solved as process\nobservations yield useful feedback for determining effective future deployment\nand monitoring decisions. In this context, we model the environmental process\nto be monitored as a spatiotemporal Gaussian process with mutual information as\na criterion to measure our understanding of the environment. To make the\nsensing resource-efficient, we demonstrate how to use matroid constraints to\nimpose a diverse set of homogeneous and heterogeneous constraints. In addition,\nto reflect the cost-sensitive nature of real-world applications, we apply\nbudgets on the cost of deployed heterogeneous robot teams.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate a formulation for optimizing coupled submodular\nmaximization problems with provable sub-optimality bounds. In robotics\napplications, it is quite common that optimization problems are coupled with\none another and therefore cannot be solved independently. Specifically, we\nconsider two problems coupled if the outcome of the first problem affects the\nsolution of a second problem that operates over a longer time scale. For\nexample, in our motivating problem of environmental monitoring, we posit that\nmulti-robot task allocation will potentially impact environmental dynamics and\nthus influence the quality of future monitoring, here modeled as a multi-robot\nintermittent deployment problem. The general theoretical approach for solving\nthis type of coupled problem is demonstrated through this motivating example.\nSpecifically, we propose a method for solving coupled problems modeled by\nsubmodular set functions with matroid constraints. A greedy algorithm for\nsolving this class of problem is presented, along with sub-optimality\nguarantees. Finally, practical optimality ratios are shown through Monte Carlo\nsimulations to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can generate\nnear-optimal solutions with high efficiency.",

Exploring a robust approach for\nvehicle detection and classification into fine-grained categories is therefore\nessentially required. Existing Vehicle Make and Model Recognition (VMMR)\nsystems have been developed on synchronized and controlled traffic conditions.\nNeed for robust VMMR in complex, urban, heterogeneous, and unsynchronized\ntraffic conditions still remain an open research area. In this paper, vehicle\ndetection and fine-grained classification are addressed using deep learning. To\nperform fine-grained classification with related complexities, local dataset\nTHS-10 having high intra-class and low interclass variation is exclusively\nprepared. The dataset consists of 4250 vehicle images of 10 vehicle models,\ni.e., Honda City, Honda Civic, Suzuki Alto, Suzuki Bolan, Suzuki Cultus, Suzuki\nMehran, Suzuki Ravi, Suzuki Swift, Suzuki Wagon R and Toyota Corolla. This\ndataset is available online. Two approaches have been explored and analyzed for\nclassification of vehicles i.e, fine-tuning, and feature extraction from deep\nneural networks. A comparative study is performed, and it is demonstrated that\nsimpler approaches can produce good results in local environment to deal with\ncomplex issues such as dense occlusion and lane departures.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technology for\nnext-generation AI systems that allows a number of workers, i.e., edge devices,\ncollaboratively learn a shared global model while keeping their data locally to\nprevent privacy leakage. Enabling FL over wireless multi-hop networks can\ndemocratize AI and make it accessible in a cost-effective manner. However, the\nnoisy bandwidth-limited multi-hop wireless connections can lead to delayed and\nnomadic model updates, which significantly slows down the FL convergence speed.\nTo address such challenges, this paper aims to accelerate FL convergence over\nwireless edge by optimizing the multi-hop federated networking performance. In\nparticular, the FL convergence optimization problem is formulated as a Markov\ndecision process (MDP). To solve such MDP, multi-agent reinforcement learning\n(MA-RL) algorithms along with domain-specific action space refining schemes are\ndeveloped, which online learn the delay-minimum forwarding paths to minimize\nthe model exchange latency between the edge devices (i.e., workers) and the\nremote server.

FedEdge allows us to fast\nprototype, deploy, and evaluate novel FL algorithms along with RL-based system\noptimization methods in real wireless devices.

    "abstract": "In this study, we present a meta-learning model to adapt the predictions of\nthe network's capacity between viewers who participate in a live video\nstreaming event. We propose the MELANIE model, where an event is formulated as\na Markov Decision Process, performing meta-learning on reinforcement learning\ntasks. By considering a new event as a task, we design an actor-critic learning\nscheme to compute the optimal policy on estimating the viewers' high-bandwidth\nconnections. To ensure fast adaptation to new connections or changes among\nviewers during an event, we implement a prioritized replay memory buffer based\non the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the reward/throughput of the viewers'\nconnections. Moreover, we adopt a model-agnostic meta-learning framework to\ngenerate a global model from past events. As viewers scarcely participate in\nseveral events, the challenge resides on how to account for the low structural\nsimilarity of different events. To combat this issue, we design a graph\nsignature buffer to calculate the structural similarities of several streaming\nevents and adjust the training of the global model accordingly. We evaluate the\nproposed model on the link weight prediction task on three real-world datasets\nof live video streaming events. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our proposed model, with an average relative gain of 25% against\nstate-of-the-art strategies.

Such exposed PII can cause\nsevere losses to the users, and informing users of their PII exposure is\ncrucial to raise their privacy awareness and encourage them to take protective\nmeasures. To this end, advanced automatic techniques are needed. While\nInformation Extraction (IE) techniques can be used to extract the PII\nautomatically, Deep Learning (DL)-based IE models alleviate the need for\nfeature engineering and further improve the efficiency. However, DL-based IE\nmodels often require large-scale labeled data for training, but PII-labeled\nsocial media posts are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns.

    "abstract": "Most algorithms developed so far for the optimization of Intelligent\nReflecting Surfaces (IRSs) require knowledge of full Channel State Information\n(CSI). However, the resulting acquisition overhead constitutes a major\nbottleneck for the realization of IRS-assisted wireless systems in practice. In\ncontrast, in this paper, focusing on downlink transmissions from a Base Station\n(BS) to a Mobile User (MU) that is located in a blockage region, we propose to\noptimize the IRS for illumination of the area centered around the MU. Hence,\nthe proposed design requires the estimation of the MU's position and not the\nfull CSI. For a given IRS phase-shift configuration, the end-to-end BS-IRS-MU\nchannel can then be estimated using conventional channel estimation techniques.\nThe IRS reconfiguration overhead for the proposed scheme depends on the MU\nmobility as well as how wide the coverage of the IRS illumination is.\nTherefore, we develop a general IRS phase-shift design, which is valid for both\nthe near- and far-field regimes and features a parameter for tuning the size of\nthe illumination area. Moreover, we study a special case where the IRS\nilluminates the entire blockage area, which implies that the IRS phase shifts\ndo not change over time leading to zero overhead for IRS reconfiguration.",

This is\ndone to support vehicles that are currently covered and/or will be by each mBS.\nWe formulate the dynamic video delivery scheme that adaptively determines 1)\nwhich content, 2) what quality and 3) how many chunks to be proactively\ndelivered from the MBS to mBSs using Markov decision process (MDP). Since it is\ndifficult for the MBS to track all the channel conditions and the network\nstates have extensive dimensions, we adopt the deep deterministic policy\ngradient (DDPG) algorithm for the DRL-based video delivery scheme.

Our work\npresents such a theoretical study of the performance of both ILC and MM on\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems with unknown transition dynamics. We\nshow that the suboptimality gap, as measured with respect to the optimal LQR\ncontroller, for ILC is lower than that for MM by higher order terms that become\nsignificant in the regime of high modeling errors. A key part of our analysis\nis the perturbation bounds for the discrete Ricatti equation in the finite\nhorizon setting, where the solution is not a fixed point and requires tracking\nthe error using recursive bounds. We back our theoretical findings with\nempirical experiments on a toy linear dynamical system with an approximate\nmodel, a nonlinear inverted pendulum system with misspecified mass, and a\nnonlinear planar quadrotor system in the presence of wind. Experiments show\nthat ILC outperforms MM significantly, in terms of the cost of computed\ntrajectories, when modeling errors are high.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has created a sudden need for a wider uptake of\nhome-based telework as means of sustaining the production. Generally,\nteleworking arrangements have direct effect on worker's efficiency and\nmotivation. The direction of this impact, however, depends on the balance\nbetween positive effects of teleworking (e.g. increased flexibility and\nautonomy) and its downsides (e.g. blurring boundaries between private and work\nlife). Moreover, these effects of teleworking can be amplified in case of\nvulnerable groups of workers, such as women. The first step in understanding\nthe implications of teleworking on women is to have timely information on the\nextent of teleworking by age and gender. In the absence of timely official\nstatistics, in this paper we propose a method for nowcasting the teleworking\ntrends by age and gender for 20 Italian regions using mobile network operators\n(MNO) data. The method is developed and validated using MNO data together with\nthe Italian quarterly Labour Force Survey. Our results confirm that the MNO\ndata have the potential to be used as a tool for monitoring gender differences\nin teleworking patterns. This tool becomes even more important today as it\ncould support the adequate gender mainstreaming in the `Next Generation EU'\nrecovery plan and help to manage related social impacts of COVID-19 through\npolicymaking.",

    "abstract": "Hypercontractivity is one of the most powerful tools in Boolean function\nanalysis. Originally studied over the discrete hypercube, recent years have\nseen increasing interest in extensions to settings like the $p$-biased cube,\nslice, or Grassmannian, where variants of hypercontractivity have found a\nnumber of breakthrough applications including the resolution of Khot's 2-2\nGames Conjecture (Khot, Minzer, Safra FOCS 2018). In this work, we develop a\nnew theory of hypercontractivity on high dimensional expanders (HDX), an\nimportant class of expanding complexes that has recently seen similarly\nimpressive applications in both coding theory and approximate sampling. Our\nresults lead to a new understanding of the structure of Boolean functions on\nHDX, including a tight analog of the KKL Theorem and a new characterization of\nnon-expanding sets.\nUnlike previous settings satisfying hypercontractivity, HDX can be\nasymmetric, sparse, and very far from products, which makes the application of\ntraditional proof techniques challenging. We handle these barriers with the\nintroduction of two new tools of independent interest: a new explicit\ncombinatorial Fourier basis for HDX that behaves well under restriction, and a\nnew local-to-global method for analyzing higher moments. Interestingly, unlike\nanalogous second moment methods that apply equally across all types of\nexpanding complexes, our tools rely inherently on simplicial structure. This\nsuggests a new distinction among high dimensional expanders based upon their\nbehavior beyond the second moment.",

Non-spiking\nartificial neural networks are typically trained with stochastic gradient\ndescent using backpropagation. The calculation of true gradients for\nbackpropagation in spiking neural networks is impeded by the non-differentiable\nfiring events of spiking neurons. On the other hand, using approximate\ngradients is effective, but computationally expensive over many time steps. One\ncommon technique, then, for training a spiking neural network is to train a\ntopologically-equivalent non-spiking network, and then convert it to an spiking\nnetwork, replacing real-valued inputs with proportionally rate-encoded Poisson\nspike trains. Converted SNNs function sufficiently well because the mean\npre-firing membrane potential of a spiking neuron is proportional to the dot\nproduct of the input rate vector and the neuron weight vector, similar to the\nfunctionality of a non-spiking network. However, this conversion only considers\nthe mean and not the temporal variance of the membrane potential. As the\nstandard deviation of the pre-firing membrane potential is proportional to the\nL4-norm of the neuron weight vector, we propose a weight adjustment based on\nthe L4-norm during the conversion process in order to improve classification\naccuracy of the converted network.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a game-theoretic feedback terminal guidance law for\nan autonomous, unpowered hypersonic pursuit vehicle that seeks to intercept an\nevading ground target whose motion is constrained along an axis. We formulate\nthis problem as a pursuit-evasion game whose saddle point solution is in\ngeneral difficult to compute onboard the hypersonic vehicle due to its highly\nnonlinear dynamics. To overcome this difficulty, we linearize the nonlinear\nhypersonic dynamics around a reference trajectory and subsequently utilize\nfeedback control design techniques from Linear Quadratic Differential Games\n(LQDGs). In our proposed guidance algorithm, the hypersonic vehicle computes\nits open-loop optimal state and input trajectories off-line and prior to the\ncommencement of the game. These trajectories are then used to linearize the\nnonlinear equations of hypersonic motion. Subsequently, using this linearized\nsystem model, we formulate an auxiliary two-player zero-sum LQDG which is\neffective in the neighborhood of the given reference trajectory and derive its\nfeedback saddle point strategy that allows the hypersonic vehicle to modify its\ntrajectory online in accordance with the changes/dispersion to the target's\nposition due to its evasive maneuvers. We provide numerical simulations to\nverify the performance of our proposed guidance law.",

However, concerns surrounding security and\ntrustworthiness impede the collection of large-scale representative medical\ndata, posing a considerable challenge for training a well-generalised model in\nclinical practices.

We further\nevaluated the model on the hold-out (collected from another two hospitals\nleaving out the FL) and heterogeneous (acquired with contrast materials) data,\nprovided visual explanations for decisions made by the model, and analysed the\ntrade-offs between the model performance and the communication costs in the\nfederated training process.

A pairwise comparison indicates that the performance\nfrom each transformed data was not significantly different from the performance\nof the raw data. Additionally, the SVM algorithm produced the highest\nperformance score on the standardized dataset. In conclusion, this study\nsuggests that high-energy gamma particles can be predicted with sufficient\naccuracy using SVM on a standardized dataset than the other algorithms with the\nvarious data transformations.",

    "abstract": "Lidar point cloud distortion from moving object is an important problem in\nautonomous driving, and recently becomes even more demanding with the emerging\nof newer lidars, which feature back-and-forth scanning patterns. Accurately\nestimating moving object velocity would not only provide a tracking capability\nbut also correct the point cloud distortion with more accurate description of\nthe moving object. Since lidar measures the time-of-flight distance but with a\nsparse angular resolution, the measurement is precise in the radial measurement\nbut lacks angularly. Camera on the other hand provides a dense angular\nresolution. In this paper, Gaussian-based lidar and camera fusion is proposed\nto estimate the full velocity and correct the lidar distortion. A probabilistic\nKalman-filter framework is provided to track the moving objects, estimate their\nvelocities and simultaneously correct the point clouds distortions. The\nframework is evaluated on real road data and the fusion method outperforms the\ntraditional ICP-based and point-cloud only method. The complete working\nframework is open-sourced\n(https://github.com/ISEE-Technology/lidar-with-velocity) to accelerate the\nadoption of the emerging lidars.",

    "abstract": "Blind visual quality assessment (BVQA) on 360{\\textdegree} video plays a key\nrole in optimizing immersive multimedia systems. When assessing the quality of\n360{\\textdegree} video, human tends to perceive its quality degradation from\nthe viewport-based spatial distortion of each spherical frame to motion\nartifact across adjacent frames, ending with the video-level quality score,\ni.e., a progressive quality assessment paradigm. However, the existing BVQA\napproaches for 360{\\textdegree} video neglect this paradigm. In this paper, we\ntake into account the progressive paradigm of human perception towards\nspherical video quality, and thus propose a novel BVQA approach (namely ProVQA)\nfor 360{\\textdegree} video via progressively learning from pixels, frames and\nvideo. Corresponding to the progressive learning of pixels, frames and video,\nthree sub-nets are designed in our ProVQA approach, i.e., the spherical\nperception aware quality prediction (SPAQ), motion perception aware quality\nprediction (MPAQ) and multi-frame temporal non-local (MFTN) sub-nets. The SPAQ\nsub-net first models the spatial quality degradation based on spherical\nperception mechanism of human. Then, by exploiting motion cues across adjacent\nframes, the MPAQ sub-net properly incorporates motion contextual information\nfor quality assessment on 360{\\textdegree} video. Finally, the MFTN sub-net\naggregates multi-frame quality degradation to yield the final quality score,\nvia exploring long-term quality correlation from multiple frames. The\nexperiments validate that our approach significantly advances the\nstate-of-the-art BVQA performance on 360{\\textdegree} video over two datasets,\nthe code of which has been public in\n\\url{https://github.com/yanglixiaoshen/ProVQA.}",

For local structure - e.g., individual dependencies\n- model-generated text is substantially less novel than our baseline of\nhuman-generated text from each model's test set. For larger-scale structure -\ne.g., overall sentence structure - model-generated text is as novel or even\nmore novel than the human-generated baseline, but models still sometimes copy\nsubstantially, in some cases duplicating passages over 1,000 words long from\nthe training set.

    "abstract": "3D object detection from LiDAR data for autonomous driving has been making\nremarkable strides in recent years. Among the state-of-the-art methodologies,\nencoding point clouds into a bird's-eye view (BEV) has been demonstrated to be\nboth effective and efficient. Different from perspective views, BEV preserves\nrich spatial and distance information between objects; and while farther\nobjects of the same type do not appear smaller in the BEV, they contain sparser\npoint cloud features. This fact weakens BEV feature extraction using\nshared-weight convolutional neural networks. In order to address this\nchallenge, we propose Range-Aware Attention Network (RAANet), which extracts\nmore powerful BEV features and generates superior 3D object detections. The\nrange-aware attention (RAA) convolutions significantly improve feature\nextraction for near as well as far objects. Moreover, we propose a novel\nauxiliary loss for density estimation to further enhance the detection accuracy\nof RAANet for occluded objects. It is worth to note that our proposed RAA\nconvolution is lightweight and compatible to be integrated into any CNN\narchitecture used for the BEV detection. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes\ndataset demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods for LiDAR-based 3D object detection, with real-time inference speed of\n16 Hz for the full version and 22 Hz for the lite version.

The DNN\nbased ADS sometimes may exhibit erroneous or unexpected behaviors due to\nunexpected driving conditions which may cause accidents. It is not possible to\ngeneralize the DNN model performance for all driving conditions. Therefore, the\ndriving conditions that were not considered during the training of the ADS may\nlead to unpredictable consequences for the safety of autonomous vehicles. This\nstudy proposes an autoencoder and time series analysis based anomaly detection\nsystem to prevent the safety critical inconsistent behavior of autonomous\nvehicles at runtime. Our approach called DeepGuard consists of two components.\nThe first component, the inconsistent behavior predictor, is based on an\nautoencoder and time series analysis to reconstruct the driving scenarios.\nBased on reconstruction error and threshold it determines the normal and\nunexpected driving scenarios and predicts potential inconsistent behavior. The\nsecond component provides on the fly safety guards, that is, it automatically\nactivates healing strategies to prevent inconsistencies in the behavior. We\nevaluated the performance of DeepGuard in predicting the injected anomalous\ndriving scenarios using already available open sourced DNN based ADSs in the\nUdacity simulator. Our simulation results show that the best variant of\nDeepGuard can predict up to 93 percent on the CHAUFFEUR ADS, 83 percent on\nDAVE2 ADS, and 80 percent of inconsistent behavior on the EPOCH ADS model,\noutperforming SELFORACLE and DeepRoad.

In many instances, using the same\nmetrics, the DNN results from low-dose inputs are also shown to be comparable\nto their high-dose counterparts. However, these metrics do not reveal if the\nDNN results preserve the visibility of subtle lesions or if they alter the CT\nimage properties such as the noise texture. Accordingly, in this work, we seek\nto examine the image quality of the DNN results from a holistic viewpoint for\nlow-dose CT image denoising. First, we build a library of advanced DNN\ndenoising architectures. This library is comprised of denoising architectures\nsuch as the DnCNN, U-Net, Red-Net, GAN, etc. Next, each network is modeled, as\nwell as trained, such that it yields its best performance in terms of the PSNR\nand SSIM. As such, data inputs (e.g. training patch-size, reconstruction\nkernel) and numeric-optimizer inputs (e.g. minibatch size, learning rate, loss\nfunction) are accordingly tuned. Finally, outputs from thus trained networks\nare further subjected to a series of CT bench testing metrics such as the\ncontrast-dependent MTF, the NPS and the HU accuracy. These metrics are employed\nto perform a more nuanced study of the resolution of the DNN outputs'\nlow-contrast features, their noise textures, and their CT number accuracy to\nbetter understand the impact each DNN algorithm has on these underlying\nattributes of image quality.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new pre-trained language model, DeBERTaV3, which\nimproves the original DeBERTa model by replacing mask language modeling (MLM)\nwith replaced token detection (RTD), a more sample-efficient pre-training task.\nOur analysis shows that vanilla embedding sharing in ELECTRA hurts training\nefficiency and model performance. This is because the training losses of the\ndiscriminator and the generator pull token embeddings in different directions,\ncreating the \"tug-of-war\" dynamics. We thus propose a new gradient-disentangled\nembedding sharing method that avoids the tug-of-war dynamics, improving both\ntraining efficiency and the quality of the pre-trained model. We have\npre-trained DeBERTaV3 using the same settings as DeBERTa to demonstrate its\nexceptional performance on a wide range of downstream natural language\nunderstanding (NLU) tasks. Taking the GLUE benchmark with eight tasks as an\nexample, the DeBERTaV3 Large model achieves a 91.37% average score, which is\n1.37% over DeBERTa and 1.91% over ELECTRA, setting a new state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) among the models with a similar structure. Furthermore, we have\npre-trained a multi-lingual model mDeBERTa and observed a larger improvement\nover strong baselines compared to English models. For example, the mDeBERTa\nBase achieves a 79.8% zero-shot cross-lingual accuracy on XNLI and a 3.6%\nimprovement over XLM-R Base, creating a new SOTA on this benchmark.

    "abstract": "Training wide and deep neural networks (DNNs) require large amounts of\nstorage resources such as memory because the intermediate activation data must\nbe saved in the memory during forward propagation and then restored for\nbackward propagation. However, state-of-the-art accelerators such as GPUs are\nonly equipped with very limited memory capacities due to hardware design\nconstraints, which significantly limits the maximum batch size and hence\nperformance speedup when training large-scale DNNs. Traditional memory saving\ntechniques either suffer from performance overhead or are constrained by\nlimited interconnect bandwidth or specific interconnect technology. In this\npaper, we propose a novel memory-efficient CNN training framework (called\nCOMET) that leverages error-bounded lossy compression to significantly reduce\nthe memory requirement for training, to allow training larger models or to\naccelerate training. Different from the state-of-the-art solutions that adopt\nimage-based lossy compressors (such as JPEG) to compress the activation data,\nour framework purposely adopts error-bounded lossy compression with a strict\nerror-controlling mechanism. Specifically, we perform a theoretical analysis on\nthe compression error propagation from the altered activation data to the\ngradients, and empirically investigate the impact of altered gradients over the\ntraining process. Based on these analyses, we optimize the error-bounded lossy\ncompression and propose an adaptive error-bound control scheme for activation\ndata compression. We evaluate our design against state-of-the-art solutions\nwith five widely-adopted CNNs and ImageNet dataset.

However, such\ninvariance could be harmful to downstream tasks if they rely on the\ncharacteristics of the data augmentations, e.g., location- or color-sensitive.\nThis is not an issue just for unsupervised learning; we found that this occurs\neven in supervised learning because it also learns to predict the same label\nfor all augmented samples of an instance. To avoid such failures and obtain\nmore generalizable representations, we suggest to optimize an auxiliary\nself-supervised loss, coined AugSelf, that learns the difference of\naugmentation parameters (e.g., cropping positions, color adjustment\nintensities) between two randomly augmented samples. Our intuition is that\nAugSelf encourages to preserve augmentation-aware information in learned\nrepresentations, which could be beneficial for their transferability.\nFurthermore, AugSelf can easily be incorporated into recent state-of-the-art\nrepresentation learning methods with a negligible additional training cost.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our simple idea consistently improves\nthe transferability of representations learned by supervised and unsupervised\nmethods in various transfer learning scenarios.

Despite\ntheir state-of-the-art performance on high-resource languages, they still fall\nbehind of their statistical counter-parts in low-resource scenarios. One\nmethodology to counter attack this problem is text augmentation, i.e.,\ngenerating new synthetic training data points from existing data. Although NLP\nhas recently witnessed a load of textual augmentation techniques, the field\nstill lacks a systematic performance analysis on a diverse set of languages and\nsequence tagging tasks. To fill this gap, we investigate three categories of\ntext augmentation methodologies which perform changes on the syntax (e.g.,\ncropping sub-sentences), token (e.g., random word insertion) and character\n(e.g., character swapping) levels. We systematically compare them on\npart-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing and semantic role labeling for a\ndiverse set of language families using various models including the\narchitectures that rely on pretrained multilingual contextualized language\nmodels such as mBERT. Augmentation most significantly improves dependency\nparsing, followed by part-of-speech tagging and semantic role labeling. We find\nthe experimented techniques to be effective on morphologically rich languages\nin general rather than analytic languages such as Vietnamese. Our results\nsuggest that the augmentation techniques can further improve over strong\nbaselines based on mBERT.

    "abstract": "Static analysis has established itself as a weapon of choice for detecting\nsecurity vulnerabilities. Taint analysis in particular is a very general and\npowerful technique, where security policies are expressed in terms of forbidden\nflows, either from untrusted input sources to sensitive sinks (in integrity\npolicies) or from sensitive sources to untrusted sinks (in confidentiality\npolicies). The appeal of this approach is that the taint-tracking mechanism has\nto be implemented only once, and can then be parameterized with different taint\nspecifications (that is, sets of sources and sinks, as well as any sanitizers\nthat render otherwise problematic flows innocuous) to detect many different\nkinds of vulnerabilities.\nBut while techniques for implementing scalable inter-procedural static taint\ntracking are fairly well established, crafting taint specifications is still\nmore of an art than a science, and in practice tends to involve a lot of manual\neffort.\nPast work has focussed on automated techniques for inferring taint\nspecifications for libraries either from their implementation or from the way\nthey tend to be used in client code. Among the latter, machine learning-based\napproaches have shown great promise.\nIn this work we present our experience combining an existing machine-learning\napproach to mining sink specifications for JavaScript libraries with manual\ntaint modelling in the context of GitHub's CodeQL analysis framework. We show\nthat the machine-learning component can successfully infer many new taint sinks\nthat either are not part of the manual modelling or are not detected due to\nanalysis incompleteness. Moreover, we present techniques for organizing sink\npredictions using automated ranking and code-similarity metrics that allow an\nanalysis engineer to efficiently sift through large numbers of predictions to\nidentify true positives.",

    "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art research for tackling the problem of malware\ndetection and classification is centered on the design, implementation and\ndeployment of systems powered by machine learning because of its ability to\ngeneralize to never-before-seen malware families and polymorphic mutations.\nHowever, it has been shown that machine learning models, in particular deep\nneural networks, lack robustness against crafted inputs (adversarial examples).\nIn this work, we have investigated the vulnerability of a state-of-the-art\nshallow convolutional neural network malware classifier against the dead code\ninsertion technique. We propose a general framework powered by a Double\nQ-network to induce misclassification over malware families. The framework\ntrains an agent through a convolutional neural network to select the optimal\npositions in a code sequence to insert dead code instructions so that the\nmachine learning classifier mislabels the resulting executable. The experiments\nshow that the proposed method significantly drops the classification accuracy\nof the classifier to 56.53% while having an evasion rate of 100% for the\nsamples belonging to the Kelihos_ver3, Simda, and Kelihos_ver1 families. In\naddition, the average number of instructions needed to mislabel malware in\ncomparison to a random agent decreased by 33%.",

We show that traditional geometric volume of fluid (VoF) methods,\nthat are based on a piecewise linear approximation of the interface, do not\nlead to an interface curvature which is convergent under mesh refinement in\ntime-dependent problems.\nInstead, we propose to use a piecewise parabolic approximation of the\ninterface, resulting in a class of piecewise parabolic interface calculation\n(PPIC) methods.

We show that a Lagrangian remapping\nmethod is sufficiently accurate for the advection of such a parabolic\ninterface.\nIt is numerically demonstrated that the newly proposed PPIC methods result in\nan increase of reconstruction accuracy by one order, convergence of the\ninterface curvature in time-dependent advection problems and Weber number\nindependent convergence of a droplet translation problem, where the advection\nmethod is coupled to a two-phase Navier--Stokes solver.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks performance has been significantly improved in the last few\nyears, at the cost of an increasing number of floating point operations per\nsecond (FLOPs). However, more FLOPs can be an issue when computational\nresources are limited. As an attempt to solve this problem, pruning filters is\na common solution, but most existing pruning methods do not preserve the model\naccuracy efficiently and therefore require a large number of finetuning epochs.\nIn this paper, we propose an automatic pruning method that learns which neurons\nto preserve in order to maintain the model accuracy while reducing the FLOPs to\na predefined target. To accomplish this task, we introduce a trainable\nbottleneck that only requires one single epoch with 25.6% (CIFAR-10) or 7.49%\n(ILSVRC2012) of the dataset to learn which filters to prune. Experiments on\nvarious architectures and datasets show that the proposed method can not only\npreserve the accuracy after pruning but also outperform existing methods after\nfinetuning. We achieve a 52.00% FLOPs reduction on ResNet-50, with a Top-1\naccuracy of 47.51% after pruning and a state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy of\n76.63% after finetuning on ILSVRC2012.

Our study is the first to evaluate the efficiency of action\nrecognition models in depth across multiple devices and train a wide range of\nvideo transformers under the same conditions. We categorize current methods\ninto three classes and show that composite transformers that augment\nconvolutional backbones are best at lightweight action recognition, despite\nlacking accuracy. Meanwhile, attention-only models need more motion modeling\ncapabilities and stand-alone attention block models currently incur too much\nlatency overhead. Our experiments conclude that current video transformers are\nnot yet capable of lightweight action recognition on par with traditional\nconvolutional baselines, and that the previously mentioned shortcomings need to\nbe addressed to bridge this gap.

In an attempt to address these challenges, researchers\nhave explored intelligibility-oriented (I-O) loss functions and integration of\naudio-visual (AV) information for more robust speech enhancement (SE). In this\npaper, we introduce DL based I-O SE algorithms exploiting AV information, which\nis a novel and previously unexplored research direction.

    "abstract": "The backswimmer fly is an aquatic insect, capable of regulating its buoyancy\nunderwater. Its abdomen is covered with hemoglobin cells, used to bind and\nrelease oxygen, reversibly. Upon entering water, the fly entraps an air bubble\nin a superhydrophobic hairy structure on its abdomen for respiration. This\nbubble, however, can change its volume through regulated oxygen flow from the\nabdominal hemoglobin cells. In this way, it can reach neutral buoyancy without\nfurther energy consumption. In this study, we develop a small, centimeter\nscale, backswimmer inspired robot (BackBot) with auto-buoyancy regulation\nthrough controlled nucleation and release of microbubbles. The bubbles nucleate\nand grow directly on onboard electrodes through electrolysis, regulated by low\nvoltage. We use 3D printing to introduce a three-dimensional bubble-entrapping\ncellular structure, in order to create a stable external gas reservoir. To\nreduce buoyancy forces, the bubbles are released through linear mechanical\nvibrations, decoupled from the robot's body. Through pressure sensing and a\nProportional Integral Derivative control loop mechanism, the robot\nauto-regulates its buoyancy to reach neutral floatation underwater within\nseconds. This mechanism can promote the replacement of traditional and\nphysically larger buoyancy regulation systems, such as pistons and pressurized\ntanks, and to enable the miniaturization of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles.",

Despite the\nprogress and active developments made in HRV metric research over the last few\ndecades, the representation of the heartbeat sequence upon which HRV is based\nhas received relatively little attention. The recently introduced heart rate\nn-variability (HRnV) offers an alternative to R-to-R peak interval\nrepresentations which complements conventional HRV analysis by considering HRV\nbehavior on varying scales.

    "abstract": "The reconstruction of microbial genomes from large metagenomic datasets is a\ncritical procedure for finding uncultivated microbial populations and defining\ntheir microbial functional roles. To achieve that, we need to perform\nmetagenomic binning, clustering the assembled contigs into draft genomes.\nDespite the existing computational tools, most of them neglect one important\nproperty of the metagenomic data, that is, the noise. To further improve the\nmetagenomic binning step and reconstruct better metagenomes, we propose a deep\nContrastive Learning framework for Metagenome Binning (CLMB), which can\nefficiently eliminate the disturbance of noise and produce more stable and\nrobust results. Essentially, instead of denoising the data explicitly, we add\nsimulated noise to the training data and force the deep learning model to\nproduce similar and stable representations for both the noise-free data and the\ndistorted data. Consequently, the trained model will be robust to noise and\nhandle it implicitly during usage. CLMB outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art binning methods significantly, recovering the most\nnear-complete genomes on almost all the benchmarking datasets (up to 17\\% more\nreconstructed genomes compared to the second-best method). It also improves the\nperformance of bin refinement, reconstructing 8-22 more high-quality genomes\nand 15-32 more middle-quality genomes than the second-best result.\nImpressively, in addition to being compatible with the binning refiner, single\nCLMB even recovers on average 15 more HQ genomes than the refiner of VAMB and\nMaxbin on the benchmarking datasets.

This\ntechnology leads to an increase in road throughput and safety, which directly\naddresses the increased infrastructure needs due to increased traffic on the\nroads. However, the No-Free-Lunch theorem states that the performance of one\nplatooning coordination strategy is not necessarily transferable to other\nproblems.

    "abstract": "Most existing causal structure learning methods require data to be\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), which often cannot be\nguaranteed when the data come from different environments. Some previous\nefforts try to tackle this problem in two independent stages, i.e., first\ndiscovering i.i.d. clusters from non-i.i.d. samples, then learning the causal\nstructures from different groups. This straightforward solution ignores the\nintrinsic connections between the two stages, that is both the clustering stage\nand the learning stage should be guided by the same causal mechanism. Towards\nthis end, we propose a unified Causal Cluster Structures Learning (named CCSL)\nmethod for causal discovery from non-i.i.d. data. This method simultaneously\nintegrates the following two tasks: 1) clustering subjects with the same causal\nmechanism; 2) learning causal structures from the samples of subjects.\nSpecifically, for the former, we provide a Causality-related Chinese Restaurant\nProcess to cluster samples based on the similarity of the causal structure; for\nthe latter, we introduce a variational-inference-based approach to learn the\ncausal structures. Theoretical results provide identification of the causal\nmodel and the clustering model under the linear non-Gaussian assumption.\nExperimental results on both simulated and real-world data further validate the\ncorrectness and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "title": "Enhanced Membership Inference Attacks against Machine Learning Models",
    "abstract": "How much does a given trained model leak about each individual data record in\nits training set? Membership inference attacks are used as an auditing tool to\nquantify the private information that a model leaks about the individual data\npoints in its training set. Membership inference attacks are influenced by\ndifferent uncertainties that an attacker has to resolve about training data,\nthe training algorithm, and the underlying data distribution. Thus attack\nsuccess rates, of many attacks in the literature, do not precisely capture the\ninformation leakage of models about their data, as they also reflect other\nuncertainties that the attack algorithm has. In this paper, we explain the\nimplicit assumptions and also the simplifications made in prior work using the\nframework of hypothesis testing. We also derive new attack algorithms from the\nframework that can achieve a high AUC score while also highlighting the\ndifferent factors that affect their performance. Our algorithms capture a very\nprecise approximation of privacy loss in models, and can be used as a tool to\nperform an accurate and informed estimation of privacy risk in machine learning\nmodels. We provide a thorough empirical evaluation of our attack strategies on\nvarious machine learning tasks and benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based models are widely used in natural language processing\n(NLP). Central to the transformer model is the self-attention mechanism, which\ncaptures the interactions of token pairs in the input sequences and depends\nquadratically on the sequence length. Training such models on longer sequences\nis expensive. In this paper, we show that a Bernoulli sampling attention\nmechanism based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), decreases the quadratic\ncomplexity of such models to linear. We bypass the quadratic cost by\nconsidering self-attention as a sum of individual tokens associated with\nBernoulli random variables that can, in principle, be sampled at once by a\nsingle hash (although in practice, this number may be a small constant). This\nleads to an efficient sampling scheme to estimate self-attention which relies\non specific modifications of LSH (to enable deployment on GPU architectures).\nWe evaluate our algorithm on the GLUE benchmark with standard 512 sequence\nlength where we see favorable performance relative to a standard pretrained\nTransformer. On the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, for evaluating\nperformance on long sequences, our method achieves results consistent with\nsoftmax self-attention but with sizable speed-ups and memory savings and often\noutperforms other efficient self-attention methods.

In\nthis work we provide a unifying schedulability test for the uniprocessor\nversion of Global EDF-Like (GEL) schedulers and arbitrary-deadline task sets.

Therefore, the unifying schedulability test\nis applicable to those algorithms.

    "abstract": "Dynamical flow networks serve as macroscopic models for, e.g., transportation\nnetworks, queuing networks, and distribution networks. While the flow dynamics\nin such networks follow the conservation of mass on the links, the outflow from\neach link is often non-linear due to, e.g., flow capacity constraints and\nsimultaneous service rate constraints. Such non-linear constraints imply a\nlimit on the magnitude of exogenous inflow that is able to be accommodated by\nthe network before it becomes overloaded and its state trajectory diverges.\nThis paper shows how the Strong integral Input-to-State Stability (Strong iISS)\nproperty allows for quantifying the effects of the exogenous inflow on the flow\ndynamics. The Strong iISS property enables a unified stability analysis of\nclasses of dynamical flow networks that were only partly analyzable before,\nsuch as networks with cycles, multi-commodity flow networks and networks with\nnon-monotone flow dynamics. We present sufficient conditions on the maximum\nmagnitude of exogenous inflow to guarantee input-to-state stability for a\ndynamical flow network, and we also present cases when this sufficient\ncondition is necessary. The conditions are exemplified on a few existing\ndynamical flow network models, specifically, fluid queuing models with\ntime-varying exogenous inflows and multi-commodity flow models.",

    "abstract": "In the real world, the degradation of images taken under haze can be quite\ncomplex, where the spatial distribution of haze is varied from image to image.\nRecent methods adopt deep neural networks to recover clean scenes from hazy\nimages directly. However, due to the paradox caused by the variation of real\ncaptured haze and the fixed degradation parameters of the current networks, the\ngeneralization ability of recent dehazing methods on real-world hazy images is\nnot ideal.To address the problem of modeling real-world haze degradation, we\npropose to solve this problem by perceiving and modeling density for uneven\nhaze distribution. We propose a novel Separable Hybrid Attention (SHA) module\nto encode haze density by capturing features in the orthogonal directions to\nachieve this goal. Moreover, a density map is proposed to model the uneven\ndistribution of the haze explicitly. The density map generates positional\nencoding in a semi-supervised way. Such a haze density perceiving and modeling\ncapture the unevenly distributed degeneration at the feature level effectively.\nThrough a suitable combination of SHA and density map, we design a novel\ndehazing network architecture, which achieves a good complexity-performance\ntrade-off.

We use CLIP\nencoding as a prefix to the caption, by employing a simple mapping network, and\nthen fine-tunes a language model to generate the image captions. The recently\nproposed CLIP model contains rich semantic features which were trained with\ntextual context, making it best for vision-language perception.

    "abstract": "Given a patent document, identifying distinct semantic annotations is an\ninteresting research aspect. Text annotation helps the patent practitioners\nsuch as examiners and patent attorneys to quickly identify the key arguments of\nany invention, successively providing a timely marking of a patent text. In the\nprocess of manual patent analysis, to attain better readability, recognising\nthe semantic information by marking paragraphs is in practice. This semantic\nannotation process is laborious and time-consuming. To alleviate such a\nproblem, we proposed a novel dataset to train Machine Learning algorithms to\nautomate the highlighting process. The contributions of this work are: i) we\ndeveloped a multi-class, novel dataset of size 150k samples by traversing USPTO\npatents over a decade, ii) articulated statistics and distributions of data\nusing imperative exploratory data analysis, iii) baseline Machine Learning\nmodels are developed to utilize the dataset to address patent paragraph\nhighlighting task, iv) dataset and codes relating to this task are open-sourced\nthrough a dedicated GIT web page:\nhttps://github.com/Renuk9390/Patent_Sentiment_Analysis and v) future path to\nextend this work using Deep Learning and domain specific pre-trained language\nmodels to develop a tool to highlight is provided.

    "abstract": "The graph coloring problem (GCP) is one of the most studied NP-HARD problems\nin computer science. Given a graph , the task is to assign a color to all\nvertices such that no vertices sharing an edge receive the same color and that\nthe number of used colors, is minimal. Different heuristic, meta-heuristic,\nmachine learning and hybrid solution methods have been applied to obtain the\nsolution. To solve this problem we use mutation of evolutionary algorithm. For\nthis purpose we introduce binary encoding for Graph Coloring Problem. This\nbinary encoding help us for mutation, evaluate, immune system and merge color\neasily and also reduce coloring dynamically. In the traditional evolutionary\nalgorithm (EA) for graph coloring, k-coloring approach is used and the EA is\nrun repeatedly until the lowest possible is reached. In our paper, we start\nwith the theoretical upper bound of chromatic number, that is, maximum\nout-degree + 1 and in the process of evolution some of the colors are made\nunused to dynamically reduce the number of color in every generation. We test\nfew standard DIMACS benchmark and compare resent paper. Maximum results are\nsame as expected chromatic color and few data sets are larger than expected\nchromatic number",

    "abstract": "Model transparency is a prerequisite in many domains and an increasingly\npopular area in machine learning research. In the medical domain, for instance,\nunveiling the mechanisms behind a disease often has higher priority than the\ndiagnostic itself since it might dictate or guide potential treatments and\nresearch directions. One of the most popular approaches to explain model global\npredictions is the permutation importance where the performance on permuted\ndata is benchmarked against the baseline. However, this method and other\nrelated approaches will undervalue the importance of a feature in the presence\nof covariates since these cover part of its provided information.

Similar\nto current state-of-the-art methods for rPPG, we apply neural networks to learn\ndeep representations with invariance to nuisance image variation. In contrast\nto such methods, we employ a fully self-supervised training approach, which has\nno reliance on expensive ground truth physiological training data. Our proposed\nmethod uses contrastive learning with a weak prior over the frequency and\ntemporal smoothness of the target signal of interest. We evaluate our approach\non four rPPG datasets, showing that comparable or better results can be\nachieved compared to recent supervised deep learning methods but without using\nany annotation. In addition, we incorporate a learned saliency resampling\nmodule into both our unsupervised approach and supervised baseline.

The current rapidly-growing literature assumes a dichotomy: either\nthe sender is powerful enough to communicate separately with each receiver\n(a.k.a. private persuasion), or she cannot communicate separately at all\n(a.k.a. public persuasion). We propose a model that smoothly interpolates\nbetween the two, by introducing a natural multi-channel communication structure\nin which each receiver observes a subset of the sender's communication\nchannels. This captures, e.g., receivers on a network, where information\nspillover is almost inevitable.\nWe completely characterize when one communication structure is better for the\nsender than another, in the sense of yielding higher optimal expected utility\nuniversally over all prior distributions and utility functions. The\ncharacterization is based on a simple pairwise relation among receivers - one\nreceiver information-dominates another if he observes at least the same\nchannels. We prove that a communication structure M_1 is (weakly) better than\nM_2 if and only if every information-dominating pair of receivers in M_1 is\nalso such in M_2. We also provide an additive FPTAS for the optimal sender's\nsignaling scheme when the number of states is constant and the graph of\ninformation-dominating pairs is a directed forest. Finally, we prove that\nfinding an optimal signaling scheme under multi-channel persuasion is\ncomputationally hard for a general family of sender's utility functions that\nadmit computationally tractable optimal signaling schemes under both public and\nprivate persuasion.",

    "abstract": "Object detection in state-of-the-art Autonomous Vehicles (AV) framework\nrelies heavily on deep neural networks. Typically, these networks perform\nobject detection uniformly on the entire camera LiDAR frames. However, this\nuniformity jeopardizes the safety of the AV by giving the same priority to all\nobjects in the scenes regardless of their risk of collision to the AV. In this\npaper, we present a new end-to-end pipeline for AV that introduces the concept\nof LiDAR cluster first and camera inference later to detect and classify\nobjects. The benefits of our proposed framework are twofold. First, our\npipeline prioritizes detecting objects that pose a higher risk of collision to\nthe AV, giving more time for the AV to react to unsafe conditions. Second, it\nalso provides, on average, faster inference speeds compared to popular deep\nneural network pipelines. We design our framework using the real-world\ndatasets, the Waymo Open Dataset, solving challenges arising from the\nlimitations of LiDAR sensors and object detection algorithms. We show that our\nnovel object detection pipeline prioritizes the detection of higher risk\nobjects while simultaneously achieving comparable accuracy and a 25% higher\naverage speed compared to camera inference only.",

Previous methods commonly\nrely on an OOD score derived from the overparameterized weight space, while\nlargely overlooking the role of sparsification. In this paper, we reveal\nimportant insights that reliance on unimportant weights and units can directly\nattribute to the brittleness of OOD detection. To mitigate the issue, we\npropose a sparsification-based OOD detection framework termed DICE. Our key\nidea is to rank weights based on a measure of contribution, and selectively use\nthe most salient weights to derive the output for OOD detection. We provide\nboth empirical and theoretical insights, characterizing and explaining the\nmechanism by which DICE improves OOD detection. By pruning away noisy signals,\nDICE provably reduces the output variance for OOD data, resulting in a sharper\noutput distribution and stronger separability from ID data.

    "abstract": "Error-bounded lossy compression is one of the most effective techniques for\nscientific data reduction. However, the traditional trial-and-error approach\nused to configure lossy compressors for finding the optimal trade-off between\nreconstructed data quality and compression ratio is prohibitively expensive. To\nresolve this issue, we develop a general-purpose analytical ratio-quality model\nbased on the prediction-based lossy compression framework, which can\neffectively foresee the reduced data quality and compression ratio, as well as\nthe impact of the lossy compressed data on post-hoc analysis quality. Our\nanalytical model significantly improves the prediction-based lossy compression\nin three use-cases: (1) optimization of predictor by selecting the best-fit\npredictor; (2) memory compression with a target ratio; and (3) in-situ\ncompression optimization by fine-grained error-bound tuning of various data\npartitions. We evaluate our analytical model on 10 scientific datasets,\ndemonstrating its high accuracy (93.47% accuracy on average) and low\ncomputational cost (up to 18.7X lower than the trial-and-error approach) for\nestimating the compression ratio and the impact of lossy compression on\npost-hoc analysis quality. We also verified the high efficiency of our\nratio-quality model using different applications across the three use-cases.

We develop a statistical model for the fronthaul rate\nand, coupled with an analysis of the user access rate, we optimize the\nplacement of the RRHs. This model allows us to formulate the location\noptimization problem with a statistical constraint on fronthaul outage. Our\nresults are cautionary, showing that the fronthaul requires considerable\nbandwidth to enable joint service to users. This requirement can be relaxed by\nserving a low number of users on the same RB. Additionally, we show that, with\na fixed number of antennas, for the multicast fronthaul, it is prudent to\nconcentrate these antennas on a few RRHs. However, for the ZF beamforming\nfronthaul, it is better to distribute the antennas on more RRHs. For the\nparameters chosen, using a ZF beamforming fronthaul improves the typical access\nrate by approximately 8% compared to multicast.

    "abstract": "Mixup-based augmentation has been found to be effective for generalizing\nmodels during training, especially for Vision Transformers (ViTs) since they\ncan easily overfit. However, previous mixup-based methods have an underlying\nprior knowledge that the linearly interpolated ratio of targets should be kept\nthe same as the ratio proposed in input interpolation. This may lead to a\nstrange phenomenon that sometimes there is no valid object in the mixed image\ndue to the random process in augmentation but there is still response in the\nlabel space. To bridge such gap between the input and label spaces, we propose\nTransMix, which mixes labels based on the attention maps of Vision\nTransformers. The confidence of the label will be larger if the corresponding\ninput image is weighted higher by the attention map. TransMix is embarrassingly\nsimple and can be implemented in just a few lines of code without introducing\nany extra parameters and FLOPs to ViT-based models. Experimental results show\nthat our method can consistently improve various ViT-based models at scales on\nImageNet classification.

    "title": "The Effects of Learning in Morphologically Evolving Robot Systems",
    "abstract": "Simultaneously evolving morphologies (bodies) and controllers (brains) of\nrobots can cause a mismatch between the inherited body and brain in the\noffspring. To mitigate this problem, the addition of an infant learning period\nby the so-called Triangle of Life framework has been proposed relatively long\nago. However, an empirical assessment is still lacking to-date. In this paper\nwe investigate the effects of such a learning mechanism from different\nperspectives. Using extensive simulations we show that learning can greatly\nincrease task performance and reduce the number of generations required to\nreach a certain fitness level compared to the purely evolutionary approach.\nFurthermore, although learning only directly affects the controllers, we\ndemonstrate that the evolved morphologies will be also different. This provides\na quantitative demonstration that changes in the brain can induce changes in\nthe body. Finally, we examine the concept of morphological intelligence\nquantified by the ability of a given body to learn. We observe that the\nlearning delta, the performance difference between the inherited and the\nlearned brain, is growing throughout the evolutionary process. This shows that\nevolution is producing robots with an increasing plasticity, that is,\nconsecutive generations are becoming better and better learners which in turn\nmakes them better and better at the given task. All in all, our results\ndemonstrate that the Triangle of Life is not only a concept of theoretical\ninterest, but a system architecture with practical benefits.",

    "abstract": "On a wide range of natural language processing and information retrieval\ntasks, transformer-based models, particularly pre-trained language models like\nBERT, have demonstrated tremendous effectiveness. Due to the quadratic\ncomplexity of the self-attention mechanism, however, such models have\ndifficulties processing long documents. Recent works dealing with this issue\ninclude truncating long documents, segmenting them into passages that can be\ntreated by a standard BERT model, or modifying the self-attention mechanism to\nmake it sparser as in sparse-attention models. However, these approaches either\nlose information or have high computational complexity (and are both time,\nmemory and energy consuming in this later case). We follow here a slightly\ndifferent approach in which one first selects key blocks of a long document by\nlocal query-block pre-ranking, and then few blocks are aggregated to form a\nshort document that can be processed by a model such as BERT. Experiments\nconducted on standard Information Retrieval datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Operating in the real-world often requires agents to learn about a complex\nenvironment and apply this understanding to achieve a breadth of goals. This\nproblem, known as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), becomes\nespecially challenging for long-horizon goals. Current methods have tackled\nthis problem by augmenting goal-conditioned policies with graph-based planning\nalgorithms. However, they struggle to scale to large, high-dimensional state\nspaces and assume access to exploration mechanisms for efficiently collecting\ntraining data. In this work, we introduce Successor Feature Landmarks (SFL), a\nframework for exploring large, high-dimensional environments so as to obtain a\npolicy that is proficient for any goal. SFL leverages the ability of successor\nfeatures (SF) to capture transition dynamics, using it to drive exploration by\nestimating state-novelty and to enable high-level planning by abstracting the\nstate-space as a non-parametric landmark-based graph. We further exploit SF to\ndirectly compute a goal-conditioned policy for inter-landmark traversal, which\nwe use to execute plans to \"frontier\" landmarks at the edge of the explored\nstate space. We show in our experiments on MiniGrid and ViZDoom that SFL\nenables efficient exploration of large, high-dimensional state spaces and\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines on long-horizon GCRL tasks.",

When compared to the baseline H-J solver using upwind schemes, the\nsolution accuracy has improved by an order of magnitude and the calculations\nare $\\approx$ 5 times faster using the modified H-J formulation. A modified\ncurvature correction has also been implemented into the H-J solver to account\nfor the near-wall errors due to concave/convex wall curvatures.

Our techniques are generally\napplicable for scaling up vision models, which has not been widely explored as\nthat of NLP language models, partly due to the following difficulties in\ntraining and applications: 1) vision models often face instability issues at\nscale and 2) many downstream vision tasks require high resolution images or\nwindows and it is not clear how to effectively transfer models pre-trained at\nlow resolutions to higher resolution ones. The GPU memory consumption is also a\nproblem when the image resolution is high.

It tops the iTHOR 1-Phase Rearrangement\nleaderboard, beating the next best submission, which employs Active Neural\nMapping, and more than doubling the % Fixed Strict metric (0.08 to 0.17). It\nalso beats the winners of the 2021 Habitat ObjectNav Challenge, which employ\nauxiliary tasks, depth maps, and human demonstrations, and those of the 2019\nHabitat PointNav Challenge. We evaluate the ability of CLIP's visual\nrepresentations at capturing semantic information about input observations --\nprimitives that are useful for navigation-heavy embodied tasks -- and find that\nCLIP's representations encode these primitives more effectively than\nImageNet-pretrained backbones. Finally, we extend one of our baselines,\nproducing an agent capable of zero-shot object navigation that can navigate to\nobjects that were not used as targets during training.",

    "abstract": "Genetic pathways usually encode molecular mechanisms that can inform targeted\ninterventions. It is often challenging for existing machine learning approaches\nto jointly model genetic pathways (higher-order features) and variants (atomic\nfeatures), and present to clinicians interpretable models. In order to build\nmore accurate and better interpretable machine learning models for genetic\nmedicine, we introduce Pathway Augmented Nonnegative Tensor factorization for\nHighER-order feature learning (PANTHER). PANTHER selects informative genetic\npathways that directly encode molecular mechanisms. We apply genetically\nmotivated constrained tensor factorization to group pathways in a way that\nreflects molecular mechanism interactions. We then train a softmax classifier\nfor disease types using the identified pathway groups. We evaluated PANTHER\nagainst multiple state-of-the-art constrained tensor/matrix factorization\nmodels, as well as group guided and Bayesian hierarchical models. PANTHER\noutperforms all state-of-the-art comparison models significantly (p<0.05). Our\nexperiments on large scale Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and whole-genome\ngenotyping datasets also demonstrated wide applicability of PANTHER. We\nperformed feature analysis in predicting disease types, which suggested\ninsights and benefits of the identified pathway groups.",

This paper addresses the issue of building height\nretrieval in large-scale urban areas from a single TerraSAR-X spotlight or\nstripmap image. Based on the radar viewing geometry, we propose that this\nproblem can be formulated as a bounding box regression problem and therefore\nallows for integrating height data from multiple data sources in generating\nground truth on a larger scale. We introduce building footprints from\ngeographic information system (GIS) data as complementary information and\npropose a bounding box regression network that exploits the location\nrelationship between a building's footprint and its bounding box, allowing for\nfast computation. This is important for large-scale applications. The method is\nvalidated on four urban data sets using TerraSAR-X images in both\nhigh-resolution spotlight and stripmap modes. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed network can reduce the computation cost significantly while\nkeeping the height accuracy of individual buildings compared to a Faster R-CNN\nbased method. Moreover, we investigate the impact of inaccurate GIS data on our\nproposed network, and this study shows that the bounding box regression network\nis robust against positioning errors in GIS data.

Furthermore, by combining such naturally constructed complex photon\ntransmission with a simple photon detection protocol, Schubert polynomials, the\nfoundation of versatile permutation operations in mathematics, have been\ngenerated. In this study, we demonstrate an order recognition algorithm\ninspired by Schubert calculus using optical near-field statistics via\nnanometre-scale photochromism. More specifically, by utilizing Schubert\npolynomials generated via optical near-field patterns, we show that the order\nof slot machines with initially unknown reward probability is successfully\nrecognized. We emphasize that, unlike conventional algorithms in the\nliterature, the proposed principle does not estimate the reward probabilities.\nInstead, it exploits the inversion relations contained in the Schubert\npolynomials. To quantitatively evaluate the impact of the Schubert polynomials\ngenerated from an optical near-field pattern, order recognition performances\nare compared with uniformly distributed and spatially strongly skewed\nprobability distributions, where the optical near-field pattern outperforms the\nothers. We found that the number of singularities contained in Schubert\npolynomials and that of the given problem or considered environment exhibits a\nclear correspondence, indicating that superior order recognition performances\nmay be attained if the singularity of the given problem is presupposed.

    "abstract": "Minwise hashing (MinHash) is a classical method for efficiently estimating\nthe Jaccrad similarity in massive binary (0/1) data. To generate $K$ hash\nvalues for each data vector, the standard theory of MinHash requires $K$\nindependent permutations. Interestingly, the recent work on \"circulant MinHash\"\n(C-MinHash) has shown that merely two permutations are needed. The first\npermutation breaks the structure of the data and the second permutation is\nre-used $K$ time in a circulant manner. Surprisingly, the estimation accuracy\nof C-MinHash is proved to be strictly smaller than that of the original\nMinHash. The more recent work further demonstrates that practically only one\npermutation is needed. Note that C-MinHash is different from the well-known\nwork on \"One Permutation Hashing (OPH)\" published in NIPS'12. OPH and its\nvariants using different \"densification\" schemes are popular alternatives to\nthe standard MinHash. The densification step is necessary in order to deal with\nempty bins which exist in One Permutation Hashing.\nIn this paper, we propose to incorporate the essential ideas of C-MinHash to\nimprove the accuracy of One Permutation Hashing. Basically, we develop a new\ndensification method for OPH, which achieves the smallest estimation variance\ncompared to all existing densification schemes for OPH. Our proposed method is\nnamed C-OPH (Circulant OPH). After the initial permutation (which breaks the\nexisting structure of the data), C-OPH only needs a \"shorter\" permutation of\nlength $D/K$ (instead of $D$), where $D$ is the original data dimension and $K$\nis the total number of bins in OPH. This short permutation is re-used in $K$\nbins in a circulant shifting manner. It can be shown that the estimation\nvariance of the Jaccard similarity is strictly smaller than that of the\nexisting (densified) OPH methods.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging can produce detailed images of the anatomy and\nphysiology of the human body that can assist doctors in diagnosing and treating\npathologies such as tumours. However, MRI suffers from very long acquisition\ntimes that make it susceptible to patient motion artifacts and limit its\npotential to deliver dynamic treatments. Conventional approaches such as\nParallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing allow for an increase in MRI\nacquisition speed by reconstructing MR images by acquiring less MRI data using\nmultiple receiver coils. Recent advancements in Deep Learning combined with\nParallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing techniques have the potential to\nproduce high-fidelity reconstructions from highly accelerated MRI data. In this\nwork we present a novel Deep Learning-based Inverse Problem solver applied to\nthe task of accelerated MRI reconstruction, called Recurrent Variational\nNetwork (RecurrentVarNet) by exploiting the properties of Convolution Recurrent\nNetworks and unrolled algorithms for solving Inverse Problems. The\nRecurrentVarNet consists of multiple blocks, each responsible for one unrolled\niteration of the gradient descent optimization algorithm for solving inverse\nproblems. Contrary to traditional approaches, the optimization steps are\nperformed in the observation domain ($k$-space) instead of the image domain.\nEach recurrent block of RecurrentVarNet refines the observed $k$-space and is\ncomprised of a data consistency term and a recurrent unit which takes as input\na learned hidden state and the prediction of the previous block. Our proposed\nmethod achieves new state of the art qualitative and quantitative\nreconstruction results on 5-fold and 10-fold accelerated data from a public\nmulti-channel brain dataset, outperforming previous conventional and deep\nlearning-based approaches. We will release all models code and baselines on our\npublic repository.",

Leveraging radar sensory data at the communication terminals provides\nimportant awareness about the transmitter/receiver locations and the\nsurrounding environment. This awareness could be utilized to reduce or even\neliminate the beam training overhead in millimeter wave (mmWave) and\nsub-terahertz (THz) MIMO communication systems, which enables a wide range of\nhighly-mobile low-latency applications. In this paper, we develop deep learning\nbased radar-aided beam prediction approaches for mmWave/sub-THz systems. The\ndeveloped solutions leverage domain knowledge for radar signal processing to\nextract the relevant features fed to the learning models. This optimizes their\nperformance, complexity, and inference time. The proposed radar-aided beam\nprediction solutions are evaluated using the large-scale real-world dataset\nDeepSense 6G, which comprises co-existing mmWave beam training and radar\nmeasurements. In addition to completely eliminating the radar/communication\ncalibration overhead, the experimental results showed that the proposed\nalgorithms are able to achieve around $90\\%$ top-5 beam prediction accuracy\nwhile saving $93\\%$ of the beam training overhead.

Our result aims at extending the theory of multivariate\nsub-Gaussian estimators to the quantum setting. Unlike classically, where any\nunivariate estimator can be turned into a multivariate estimator with at most a\nlogarithmic overhead in the dimension, no similar result can be proved in the\nquantum setting. Indeed, Heinrich ruled out the existence of a quantum\nadvantage for the mean estimation problem when the sample complexity is smaller\nthan the dimension. Our main result is to show that, outside this low-precision\nregime, there is a quantum estimator that outperforms any classical estimator.\nOur approach is substantially more involved than in the univariate setting,\nwhere most quantum estimators rely only on phase estimation. We exploit a\nvariety of additional algorithmic techniques such as amplitude amplification,\nthe Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, and quantum singular value transformation.\nOur analysis also uses concentration inequalities for multivariate truncated\nstatistics.\nWe develop our quantum estimators in two different input models that showed\nup in the literature before. The first one provides coherent access to the\nbinary representation of the random variable and it encompasses the classical\nsetting. In the second model, the random variable is directly encoded into the\nphases of quantum registers. This model arises naturally in many quantum\nalgorithms but it is often incomparable to having classical samples.

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing relevance of forecasting methods, the causal\nimplications of these algorithms remain largely unexplored. This is concerning\nconsidering that, even under simplifying assumptions such as causal\nsufficiency, the statistical risk of a model can differ significantly from its\n\\textit{causal risk}. Here, we study the problem of *causal generalization* --\ngeneralizing from the observational to interventional distributions -- in\nforecasting. Our goal is to find answers to the question: How does the efficacy\nof an autoregressive (VAR) model in predicting statistical associations compare\nwith its ability to predict under interventions?\nTo this end, we introduce the framework of *causal learning theory* for\nforecasting. Using this framework, we obtain a characterization of the\ndifference between statistical and causal risks, which helps identify sources\nof divergence between them. Under causal sufficiency, the problem of causal\ngeneralization amounts to learning under covariate shifts albeit with\nadditional structure (restriction to interventional distributions). This\nstructure allows us to obtain uniform convergence bounds on causal\ngeneralizability for the class of VAR models. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work that provides theoretical guarantees for causal\ngeneralization in the time-series setting.",
