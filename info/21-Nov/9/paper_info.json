    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have moved beyond a platform for hobbyists to\nenable environmental monitoring, journalism, film industry, search and rescue,\npackage delivery, and entertainment. This paper describes 3D displays using\nswarms of flying light specks, FLSs. An FLS is a small (hundreds of micrometers\nin size) UAV with one or more light sources to generate different colors and\ntextures with adjustable brightness. A synchronized swarm of FLSs renders an\nillumination in a pre-specified 3D volume, an FLS display. An FLS display\nprovides true depth, enabling a user to perceive a scene more completely by\nanalyzing its illumination from different angles.\nAn FLS display may either be non-immersive or immersive. Both will support 3D\nacoustics. Non-immersive FLS displays may be the size of a 1980's computer\nmonitor, enabling a surgical team to observe and control micro robots\nperforming heart surgery inside a patient's body. Immersive FLS displays may be\nthe size of a room, enabling users to interact with objects, e.g., a rock, a\nteapot. An object with behavior will be constructed using FLS-matters.\nFLS-matter will enable a user to touch and manipulate an object, e.g., a user\nmay pick up a teapot or throw a rock. An immersive and interactive FLS display\nwill approximate Star Trek's Holodeck.\nA successful realization of the research ideas presented in this paper will\nprovide fundamental insights into implementing a Holodeck using swarms of FLSs.\nA Holodeck will transform the future of human communication and perception, and\nhow we interact with information and data. It will revolutionize the future of\nhow we work, learn, play and entertain, receive medical care, and socialize.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD), best known as an effective method for model\ncompression, aims at transferring the knowledge of a bigger network (teacher)\nto a much smaller network (student). Conventional KD methods usually employ the\nteacher model trained in a supervised manner, where output labels are treated\nonly as targets. Extending this supervised scheme further, we introduce a new\ntype of teacher model for KD, namely Oracle Teacher, that utilizes the\nembeddings of both the source inputs and the output labels to extract a more\naccurate knowledge to be transferred to the student. The proposed model follows\nthe encoder-decoder attention structure of the Transformer network, which\nallows the model to attend to related information from the output labels.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on three different sequence learning tasks:\nspeech recognition, scene text recognition, and machine translation. From the\nexperimental results, we empirically show that the proposed model improves the\nstudents across these tasks while achieving a considerable speed-up in the\nteacher model's training time.",

We examine what this\ncontention means from the perspective of the sociocultural context in which AI\nsystems are designed, developed, and deployed and focus on intersections with\nanti-Black racism (antiblackness). To bring these multiple perspectives\ntogether and show an example of antiblackness in the face of attempts at\nde-biasing, we discuss results from auditing an existing open-source semantic\nnetwork (ConceptNet). We use this discussion to further contextualize\nantiblackness in design, development, and deployment of AI systems and suggest\nquestions one may ask when attempting to combat antiblackness in AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Training intelligent agents that can drive autonomously in various urban and\nhighway scenarios has been a hot topic in the robotics society within the last\ndecades. However, the diversity of driving environments in terms of road\ntopology and positioning of the neighboring vehicles makes this problem very\nchallenging. It goes without saying that although scenario-specific driving\npolicies for autonomous driving are promising and can improve transportation\nsafety and efficiency, they are clearly not a universal scalable solution.\nInstead, we seek decision-making schemes and driving policies that can\ngeneralize to novel and unseen environments. In this work, we capitalize on the\nkey idea that human drivers learn abstract representations of their\nsurroundings that are fairly similar among various driving scenarios and\nenvironments. Through these representations, human drivers are able to quickly\nadapt to novel environments and drive in unseen conditions. Formally, through\nimposing an information bottleneck, we extract a latent representation that\nminimizes the \\textit{distance} -- a quantification that we introduce to gauge\nthe similarity among different driving configurations -- between driving\nscenarios. This latent space is then employed as the input to a Q-learning\nmodule to learn generalizable driving policies. Our experiments revealed that,\nusing this latent representation can reduce the number of crashes to about\nhalf.",

Although, recently,\nseveral larger high resolution remote sensing (HRRS) datasets have appeared\nwith a goal of establishing new benchmarks, attempts at training models from\nscratch on these datasets are sporadic. In this paper, we show that training\nmodels from scratch on several newer datasets yields comparable results to\nfine-tuning the models pre-trained on ImageNet.

    "abstract": "Consider the following social choice problem. Suppose we have a set of $n$\nvoters and $m$ candidates that lie in a metric space. The goal is to design a\nmechanism to choose a candidate whose average distance to the voters is as\nsmall as possible. However, the mechanism does not get direct access to the\nmetric space. Instead, it gets each voter's ordinal ranking of the candidates\nby distance. Given only this partial information, what is the smallest\nworst-case approximation ratio (known as the distortion) that a mechanism can\nguarantee?\nA simple example shows that no deterministic mechanism can guarantee\ndistortion better than $3$, and no randomized mechanism can guarantee\ndistortion better than $2$. It has been conjectured that both of these lower\nbounds are optimal, and recently, Gkatzelis, Halpern, and Shah proved this\nconjecture for deterministic mechanisms. We disprove the conjecture for\nrandomized mechanisms for $m \\geq 3$ by constructing elections for which no\nrandomized mechanism can guarantee distortion better than $2.0261$ for $m = 3$,\n$2.0496$ for $m = 4$, up to $2.1126$ as $m \\to \\infty$. We obtain our lower\nbounds by identifying a class of simple metrics that appear to capture much of\nthe hardness of the problem, and we show that any randomized mechanism must\nhave high distortion on one of these metrics. We provide a nearly matching\nupper bound for this restricted class of metrics as well. Finally, we\nconjecture that these bounds give the optimal distortion for every $m$, and\nprovide a proof for $m = 3$, thereby resolving that case.",

However, when we take the position of an agent, the problem of\nselecting a best route should also factor in the abilities of the agent, its\nembodiment and particularly its cognitive effort. In this paper we consider\ngeometry in terms of travel between states within a world by incorporating\ninformation processing costs with the appropriate spatial distances. This\ninduces a geometry that increasingly differs from the original geometry of the\ngiven world, as information costs become increasingly important. We visualize\nthis \\textit{\"cognitive geometry\"} by projecting it onto 2- and 3-dimensional\nspaces showing distinct distortions reflecting the emergence of epistemic and\ninformation-saving strategies as well as pivot states. The analogies between\ntraditional cost-based geometries and those induced by additional informational\ncosts invite a generalization of the traditional notion of geodesics as\ncheapest routes towards the notion of \\textit{infodesics}.

    "abstract": "Model Inversion (MI), in which an adversary abuses access to a trained\nMachine Learning (ML) model attempting to infer sensitive information about its\noriginal training data, has attracted increasing research attention. During MI,\nthe trained model under attack (MUA) is usually frozen and used to guide the\ntraining of a generator, such as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), to\nreconstruct the distribution of the original training data of that model. This\nmight cause leakage of original training samples, and if successful, the\nprivacy of dataset subjects will be at risk if the training data contains\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII). Therefore, an in-depth investigation\nof the potentials of MI techniques is crucial for the development of\ncorresponding defense techniques. High-quality reconstruction of training data\nbased on a single model is challenging. However, existing MI literature does\nnot explore targeting multiple models jointly, which may provide additional\ninformation and diverse perspectives to the adversary.\nWe propose the ensemble inversion technique that estimates the distribution\nof original training data by training a generator constrained by an ensemble\n(or set) of trained models with shared subjects or entities. This technique\nleads to noticeable improvements of the quality of the generated samples with\ndistinguishable features of the dataset entities compared to MI of a single ML\nmodel. We achieve high quality results without any dataset and show how\nutilizing an auxiliary dataset that's similar to the presumed training data\nimproves the results.

    "abstract": "The quadrature-based method of moments (QMOM) offers a promising class of\napproximation techniques for reducing kinetic equations to fluid equations that\nare valid beyond thermodynamic equilibrium. A major challenge with these and\nother closures is that whenever the flux function must be evaluated (e.g., in a\nnumerical update), a moment-inversion problem must be solved that computes the\nflux from the known input moments. In this work we study a particular\nfive-moment variant of QMOM known as HyQMOM and establish that this system is\nmoment-invertible over a convex region in solution space. We then develop a\nhigh-order Lax-Wendroff discontinuous Galerkin scheme for solving the resulting\nfluid system. The scheme is based on a predictor-corrector approach, where the\nprediction step is a localized space-time discontinuous Galerkin scheme. The\nnonlinear algebraic system that arises in this prediction step is solved using\na Picard iteration. The correction step is a straightforward explicit update\nusing the predicted solution in order to evaluate space-time flux integrals. In\nthe absence of additional limiters, the proposed high-order scheme does not in\ngeneral guarantee that the numerical solution remains in the convex set over\nwhich HyQMOM is moment-invertible. To overcome this challenge, we introduce\nnovel limiters that rigorously guarantee that the computed solution does not\nleave the convex set over which moment-invertible and hyperbolicity of the\nfluid system is guaranteed. We develop positivity-preserving limiters in both\nthe prediction and correction steps, as well as an oscillation-limiter that\ndamps unphysical oscillations near shocks and rarefactions. Finally, we perform\nconvergence tests to verify the order of accuracy of the scheme, as well as\ntest the scheme on Riemann data to demonstrate the shock-capturing and\nrobustness of the method.",

    "abstract": "One of the key compilation steps in Quantum Computing (QC) is to determine an\ninitial logical to physical mapping of the qubits used in a quantum circuit.\nThe impact of the starting qubit layout can vastly affect later scheduling and\nplacement decisions of QASM operations, yielding higher values on critical\nperformance metrics (gate count and circuit depth) as a result of quantum\ncompilers introducing SWAP operations to meet the underlying physical\nneighboring and connectivity constraints of the quantum device.\nIn this paper we introduce a novel qubit mapping approach, string-based qubit\nmapping. The key insight is to prioritize the mapping of logical qubits that\nappear in longest repeating non-overlapping substrings of qubit pairs accessed.\nThis mapping method is complemented by allocating qubits according to their\nglobal frequency usage. We evaluate and compare our new mapping scheme against\ntwo quantum compilers (QISKIT and TKET) and two device topologies, the IBM\nManhattan (65 qubits) and the IBM Kolkata (27 qubits). Our results demonstrate\nthat combining both mapping mechanisms often achieve better results than either\none individually, allowing us to best QISKIT and TKET baselines, yielding\nbetween 13% and 17% average improvement in several group sizes, up to 32%\ncircuit depth reduction and 63% gate volume improvement.",

    "abstract": "In designing distributed and parallel systems there are several approaches\nfor programming interactions in a multiprocess environment. Usually, these\napproaches take care only of synchronization or communication in two-party\ninteractions. This paper is concerned with a more general concept: multiparty\ninteractions. In a multiparty interaction, several executing threads somehow\n\"come together\" to produce an intermediate and temporary combined state, use\nthis state as a well-defined starting point for some joint activity, and then\nleave this interaction and continue their separate execution. The concept of\nmultiparty interactions has been investigated by several researchers, but to\nthe best of our knowledge, none have considered how faults in one or more\nparticipants of the multiparty interaction can best be dealt with. The goal of\nthis paper is twofold: to show how an existing specification language can be\nextended in order to allow dependable multiparty interactions (DMIs) to be\ndeclared and to present an object-oriented framework for implementing DMIs in\ndistributed systems. To show how our scheme can be used to program a system in\nwhich multiparty interactions are more than simple synchronizations or\ncommunications, we use a case study based on an industrial production cell\nmodel developed by Forschungszentrum Informatik, Karlsruhe, Germany.",

Precisely, given any\ngraph G and integer k, we can in fixed-parameter time construct a data\nstructure that can later be used to answer queries of the form: ``are vertices\ns and t connected via a path that avoids vertices $u_1,..., u_k$?'' in time\n$2^{2^{O(k)}}$. In the terminology of the literature on data structures, this\ngives the first deterministic data structure for connectivity under vertex\nfailures where for every fixed number of failures, all operations can be\nperformed in constant time.\nWith the aim to understand the power and the limitations of our new\ntechniques, we prove an algorithmic meta theorem for the recently introduced\nseparator logic, which extends first-order logic with atoms for connectivity\nunder vertex failures. We prove that the model-checking problem for separator\nlogic is fixed-parameter tractable on every class of graphs that exclude a\nfixed topological minor. We also show a weak converse. This implies that from\nthe point of view of parameterized complexity, under standard complexity\nassumptions, the frontier of tractability of separator logic is almost exactly\ndelimited by classes excluding a fixed topological minor.\nThe backbone of our proof relies on a decomposition theorem of Cygan et al.\n[SICOMP '19], which provides a tree decomposition of a given graph into bags\nthat are unbreakable. Crucially, unbreakability allows to reduce separator\nlogic to plain first-order logic within each bag individually. We design our\nmodel-checking algorithm using dynamic programming over the tree decomposition,\nwhere the transition at each bag amounts to running a suitable model-checking\nsubprocedure for plain first-order logic. This approach is robust enough to\nprovide also efficient enumeration of queries expressed in separator logic.",

    "abstract": "Federated Averaging (FedAvg), also known as Local SGD, is one of the most\npopular algorithms in Federated Learning (FL). Despite its simplicity and\npopularity, the convergence rate of FedAvg has thus far been undetermined. Even\nunder the simplest assumptions (convex, smooth, homogeneous, and bounded\ncovariance), the best-known upper and lower bounds do not match, and it is not\nclear whether the existing analysis captures the capacity of the algorithm. In\nthis work, we first resolve this question by providing a lower bound for FedAvg\nthat matches the existing upper bound, which shows the existing FedAvg upper\nbound analysis is not improvable. Additionally, we establish a lower bound in a\nheterogeneous setting that nearly matches the existing upper bound. While our\nlower bounds show the limitations of FedAvg, under an additional assumption of\nthird-order smoothness, we prove more optimistic state-of-the-art convergence\nresults in both convex and non-convex settings. Our analysis stems from a\nnotion we call iterate bias, which is defined by the deviation of the\nexpectation of the SGD trajectory from the noiseless gradient descent\ntrajectory with the same initialization. We prove novel sharp bounds on this\nquantity, and show intuitively how to analyze this quantity from a Stochastic\nDifferential Equation (SDE) perspective.",

In this paper, we propose a root cause\nanalysis framework called CloudRCA which makes use of heterogeneous\nmulti-source data including Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), logs, as well as\ntopology, and extracts important features via state-of-the-art anomaly\ndetection and log analysis techniques. The engineered features are then\nutilized in a Knowledge-informed Hierarchical Bayesian Network (KHBN) model to\ninfer root causes with high accuracy and efficiency. Ablation study and\ncomprehensive experimental comparisons demonstrate that, compared to existing\nframeworks, CloudRCA 1) consistently outperforms existing approaches in\nf1-score across different cloud systems; 2) can handle novel types of root\ncauses thanks to the hierarchical structure of KHBN; 3) performs more robustly\nwith respect to algorithmic configurations; and 4) scales more favorably in the\ndata and feature sizes. Experiments also show that a cross-platform transfer\nlearning mechanism can be adopted to further improve the accuracy by more than\n10\\%.

In this work,\nwe propose Model Quantization Benchmark (MQBench), a first attempt to evaluate,\nanalyze, and benchmark the reproducibility and deployability for model\nquantization algorithms. We choose multiple different platforms for real-world\ndeployments, including CPU, GPU, ASIC, DSP, and evaluate extensive\nstate-of-the-art quantization algorithms under a unified training pipeline.\nMQBench acts like a bridge to connect the algorithm and the hardware.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of controlling a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)\nsystem over a finite horizon $T$ with fixed and known cost matrices $Q,R$, but\nunknown and non-stationary dynamics $\\{A_t, B_t\\}$. The sequence of dynamics\nmatrices can be arbitrary, but with a total variation, $V_T$, assumed to be\n$o(T)$ and unknown to the controller. Under the assumption that a sequence of\nstabilizing, but potentially sub-optimal controllers is available for all $t$,\nwe present an algorithm that achieves the optimal dynamic regret of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(V_T^{2/5}T^{3/5}\\right)$. With piece-wise constant\ndynamics, our algorithm achieves the optimal regret of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{ST})$ where $S$ is the number of switches. The crux\nof our algorithm is an adaptive non-stationarity detection strategy, which\nbuilds on an approach recently developed for contextual Multi-armed Bandit\nproblems. We also argue that non-adaptive forgetting (e.g., restarting or using\nsliding window learning with a static window size) may not be regret optimal\nfor the LQR problem, even when the window size is optimally tuned with the\nknowledge of $V_T$. The main technical challenge in the analysis of our\nalgorithm is to prove that the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator has a\nsmall bias when the parameter to be estimated is non-stationary. Our analysis\nalso highlights that the key motif driving the regret is that the LQR problem\nis in spirit a bandit problem with linear feedback and locally quadratic cost.\nThis motif is more universal than the LQR problem itself, and therefore we\nbelieve our results should find wider application.",

    "abstract": "The Metaverse is regarded as the next-generation Internet paradigm that\nallows humans to play, work, and socialize in an alternative virtual world with\nimmersive experience, for instance, via head-mounted display for Virtual\nReality (VR) rendering. With the help of ubiquitous wireless connections and\npowerful edge computing technologies, VR users in wireless edge-empowered\nMetaverse can immerse in the virtual through the access of VR services offered\nby different providers. However, VR applications are computation- and\ncommunication-intensive. The VR service providers (SPs) have to optimize the VR\nservice delivery efficiently and economically given their limited communication\nand computation resources. An incentive mechanism can be thus applied as an\neffective tool for managing VR services between providers and users. Therefore,\nin this paper, we propose a learning-based Incentive Mechanism framework for VR\nservices in the Metaverse. First, we propose the quality of perception as the\nmetric for VR users immersing in the virtual world. Second, for quick trading\nof VR services between VR users (i.e., buyers) and VR SPs (i.e., sellers), we\ndesign a double Dutch auction mechanism to determine optimal pricing and\nallocation rules in this market. Third, for auction communication reduction, we\ndesign a deep reinforcement learning-based auctioneer to accelerate this\nauction process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework\ncan achieve near-optimal social welfare while reducing at least half of the\nauction information exchange cost than baseline methods.",

    "title": "Monotonic Safety for Scalable and Data-Efficient Probabilistic Safety  Analysis",
    "abstract": "Autonomous systems with machine learning-based perception can exhibit\nunpredictable behaviors that are difficult to quantify, let alone verify. Such\nbehaviors are convenient to capture in probabilistic models, but probabilistic\nmodel checking of such models is difficult to scale -- largely due to the\nnon-determinism added to models as a prerequisite for provable conservatism.\nStatistical model checking (SMC) has been proposed to address the scalability\nissue. However it requires large amounts of data to account for the\naforementioned non-determinism, which in turn limits its scalability. This work\nintroduces a general technique for reduction of non-determinism based on\nassumptions of \"monotonic safety'\", which define a partial order between system\nstates in terms of their probabilities of being safe. We exploit these\nassumptions to remove non-determinism from controller/plant models to\ndrastically speed up probabilistic model checking and statistical model\nchecking while providing provably conservative estimates as long as the safety\nis indeed monotonic. Our experiments demonstrate model-checking speed-ups of an\norder of magnitude while maintaining acceptable accuracy and require much less\ndata for accurate estimates when running SMC -- even when monotonic safety does\nnot perfectly hold and provable conservatism is not achieved.",

Like newborn animals, our\nagents learn collective behavior from raw sensory inputs in naturalistic\nenvironments. Our agents also learn collective behavior without external\nrewards, using only intrinsic motivation (curiosity) to drive learning.\nSpecifically, when we raise our artificial agents in natural visual\nenvironments with groupmates, the agents spontaneously develop ego-motion,\nobject recognition, and a preference for groupmates, rapidly learning all of\nthe core skills required for collective behavior. This work bridges the divide\nbetween high-dimensional sensory inputs and collective action, resulting in a\npixels-to-actions model of collective animal behavior.

We aim to obtain intermediate representations for\nspeaker-content disentanglement of speech to better remove speaker information\nand get pure content information. Accordingly, our proposed framework contains\na module that removes the speaker information from the acoustic feature of the\nsource speaker. Moreover, speaker information control is added to our system to\nmaintain the voice cloning performance. The proposed system is evaluated by\nsubjective and objective metrics. Results show that our proposed system\nsignificantly reduces the trade-off problem in zero-shot voice conversion,\nwhile it also manages to have high spoofing power to the speaker verification\nsystem.",

In this paper, a novel\nmulti-modal framework which integrates skeletal, holistic appearance, facial\nand scenic cues is proposed for comprehensive dance virality prediction.

    "title": "Prediction of Pedestrian Spatiotemporal Risk Levels for Intelligent  Vehicles: A Data-driven Approach",
    "abstract": "In recent years, road safety has attracted significant attention from\nresearchers and practitioners in the intelligent transport systems domain. As\none of the most common and vulnerable groups of road users, pedestrians cause\ngreat concerns due to their unpredictable behavior and movement, as subtle\nmisunderstandings in vehicle-pedestrian interaction can easily lead to risky\nsituations or collisions. Existing methods use either predefined\ncollision-based models or human-labeling approaches to estimate the\npedestrians' risks. These approaches are usually limited by their poor\ngeneralization ability and lack of consideration of interactions between the\nego vehicle and a pedestrian. This work tackles the listed problems by\nproposing a Pedestrian Risk Level Prediction system. The system consists of\nthree modules. Firstly, vehicle-perspective pedestrian data are collected.\nSince the data contains information regarding the movement of both the ego\nvehicle and pedestrian, it can simplify the prediction of spatiotemporal\nfeatures in an interaction-aware fashion. Using the long short-term memory\nmodel, the pedestrian trajectory prediction module predicts their\nspatiotemporal features in the subsequent five frames. As the predicted\ntrajectory follows certain interaction and risk patterns, a hybrid clustering\nand classification method is adopted to explore the risk patterns in the\nspatiotemporal features and train a risk level classifier using the learned\npatterns. Upon predicting the spatiotemporal features of pedestrians and\nidentifying the corresponding risk level, the risk patterns between the ego\nvehicle and pedestrians are determined. Experimental results verified the\ncapability of the PRLP system to predict the risk level of pedestrians, thus\nsupporting the collision risk assessment of intelligent vehicles and providing\nsafety warnings to both vehicles and pedestrians.",

Nonetheless, (i) No study has been conducted on\nvideo analysis and action recognition of CS: GO game-play which can play a\nsubstantial role in the gaming industry for prediction model (ii) No work has\nbeen done on the real-time application on the actions and results of a CS: GO\nmatch (iii) Game data of a match is usually available in the HLTV as a CSV\nformatted file however it does not have open access and HLTV tends to prevent\nusers from taking data. This manuscript aims to develop a model for accurate\nprediction of 4 different actions and compare the performance among the five\ndifferent transfer learning models with our self-developed deep neural network\nand identify the best-fitted model and also including major voting later on,\nwhich is qualified to provide real time prediction and the result of this model\naids to the construction of the automated system of gathering and processing\nmore data alongside solving the issue of collecting data from HLTV.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface\n(STAR-RIS) is a promising technology to achieve full-space coverage. This paper\ninvestigates the resource allocation problem in a STAR-RIS-assisted\nmulti-carrier communication network. To maximize the system sum-rate, a joint\noptimization problem for orthogonal multiple access (OMA) is first formulated,\nwhich is a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem. To solve this\nchallenging problem, we first propose a channel assignment scheme utilizing\nmatching theory and then invoke the alternating optimization-based method to\noptimize the resource allocation policy and beamforming vectors iteratively.\nFurthermore, the sum-rate maximization problem for non-orthogonal multiple\naccess (NOMA) is investigated. To efficiently solve it, we first propose a\nlocation-based matching algorithm to determine the sub-channel assignment,\nwhere a transmitted user and a reflected user are grouped on a sub-channel.\nThen, a three-step approach is proposed, where the decoding orders,\nbeamforming-coefficient vectors, and power allocation are optimized by\nemploying semidefinite programming, convex upper bound approximation, and\ngeometry programming, respectively. Numerical results unveil that: 1) For OMA,\na general design that includes same-side user-pairing for channel assignment is\npreferable, while for NOMA, the proposed transmission-and-reflection scheme can\nachieve near-optimal performance. 2) The STAR-RIS-aided NOMA network\nsignificantly outperforms the networks employing conventional RISs and OMA.",

Rapid mixing is of interest in\napproximately sampling a structure, over some underlying set or graph, from\nsome target distribution. In the case of independent sets, we show that when\n$G$ has bounded treewidth, this random walk -- known as the hardcore Glauber\ndynamics -- mixes rapidly for all values of the standard parameter $\\lambda >\n0$, giving a simple alternative to existing sampling algorithms for these\nstructures.\nWe also show rapid mixing for Markov chains on dominating sets and $b$-edge\ncovers (for fixed $b\\geq 1$ and $\\lambda > 0$) in the case where treewidth is\nbounded, and for Markov chains on the $b$-matchings (for fixed $b \\geq 1$ and\n$\\lambda > 0$), the maximal independent sets, and the maximal $b$-matchings of\na graph (for fixed $b \\geq 1$), in the case where carving width is bounded.\nWe prove our results by developing a divide-and-conquer framework using the\nwell-known multicommodity flows technique. Using this technique, we\nadditionally show that a similar dynamics on the $k$-angulations of a convex\nset of $n$ points mixes in quasipolynomial time for all $k \\geq 3$. (McShine\nand Tetali gave a stronger result in the special case $k = 3$.)\nOur technique also allows us to strengthen existing results by Dyer,\nGoldberg, and Jerrum and by Heinrich for the Glauber dynamics on the\n$q$-colorings of $G$ on graphs of bounded carving width, when $q \\geq \\Delta +\n2$ is bounded. Specifically, our technique yields an improvement in the\ndependence on treewidth when $\\Delta < 2t$ or when $q < 4t$ and $\\Delta < t^2$.\nWe additionally show that the Glauber dynamics on the partial $q$-colorings\nof $G$ mix rapidly for all $\\lambda > 0$ when $q \\geq \\Delta + 2$ is bounded.",

    "abstract": "Desert locust outbreaks threaten the food security of a large part of Africa\nand have affected the livelihoods of millions of people over the years. Machine\nlearning (ML) has been demonstrated as an effective approach to locust\ndistribution modelling which could assist in early warning. ML requires a\nsignificant amount of labelled data to train. Most publicly available labelled\ndata on locusts are presence-only data, where only the sightings of locusts\nbeing present at a location are recorded. Therefore, prior work using ML have\nresorted to pseudo-absence generation methods as a way to circumvent this\nissue. The most commonly used approach is to randomly sample points in a region\nof interest while ensuring that these sampled pseudo-absence points are at\nleast a specific distance away from true presence points. In this paper, we\ncompare this random sampling approach to more advanced pseudo-absence\ngeneration methods, such as environmental profiling and optimal background\nextent limitation, specifically for predicting desert locust breeding grounds\nin Africa. Interestingly, we find that for the algorithms we tested, namely\nlogistic regression, gradient boosting, random forests and maximum entropy, all\npopular in prior work, the logistic model performed significantly better than\nthe more sophisticated ensemble methods, both in terms of prediction accuracy\nand F1 score. Although background extent limitation combined with random\nsampling boosted performance for ensemble methods, for LR this was not the\ncase, and instead, a significant improvement was obtained when using\nenvironmental profiling. In light of this, we conclude that a simpler ML\napproach such as logistic regression combined with more advanced pseudo-absence\ngeneration, specifically environmental profiling, can be a sensible and\neffective approach to predicting locust breeding grounds across Africa.",

Despite being studied since the 19th century, little is\nknown about how the dynamics of random fields are related to the geometric\nproperties of their parametric spaces. For example, how can we quantify the\nsimilarity between two random fields operating in different regimes using an\nintrinsic measure? In this paper, we propose a numerical method for the\ncomputation of geodesic distances in Gaussian random field manifolds. First, we\nderive the metric tensor of the underlying parametric space (the 3 x 3\nfirst-order Fisher information matrix), then we derive the 27 Christoffel\nsymbols required in the definition of the system of non-linear differential\nequations whose solution is a geodesic curve starting at the initial\nconditions. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method is applied to numerically solve\nthe non-linear system through an iterative approach. The obtained results show\nthat the proposed method can estimate the geodesic distances for several\ndifferent initial conditions. Besides, the results reveal an interesting\npattern: in several cases, the geodesic curve obtained by reversing the system\nof differential equations in time does not match the original curve, suggesting\nthe existence of irreversible geometric deformations in the trajectory of a\nmoving reference traveling along a geodesic curve.",

We characterize dangerous speech\nusers by assigning Danger Amplification Belief scores and show that dangerous\nusers are more active on Twitter as compared to other users as well as most\ninfluential in the network, in terms of a larger following as well as volume of\nverified accounts. We find that dangerous users have a more polarized\nviewership, suggesting that their audience is more susceptible to incitement.\nUsing a mix of network centrality measures and qualitative analysis, we find\nthat most dangerous accounts tend to either be in mass media related\noccupations or allied with low-ranking, right-leaning politicians, and act as\n\"broadcasters\" in the network, where they are best positioned to spearhead the\nrapid dissemination of dangerous speech across the platform.",

    "abstract": "Most existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods minimize the\ndistance between multiple source-target domain pairs via feature distribution\nalignment, an approach borrowed from the single source setting. However, with\ndiverse source domains, aligning pairwise feature distributions is challenging\nand could even be counter-productive for MSDA. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel approach: transferable attribute learning. The motivation is simple:\nalthough different domains can have drastically different visual appearances,\nthey contain the same set of classes characterized by the same set of\nattributes; an MSDA model thus should focus on learning the most transferable\nattributes for the target domain. Adopting this approach, we propose a domain\nattention consistency network, dubbed DAC-Net. The key design is a feature\nchannel attention module, which aims to identify transferable features\n(attributes). Importantly, the attention module is supervised by a consistency\nloss, which is imposed on the distributions of channel attention weights\nbetween source and target domains. Moreover, to facilitate discriminative\nfeature learning on the target data, we combine pseudo-labeling with a class\ncompactness loss to minimize the distance between the target features and the\nclassifier's weight vectors. Extensive experiments on three MSDA benchmarks\nshow that our DAC-Net achieves new state of the art performance on all of them.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer has long been a prominent cause of mortality among women.\nDiagnosis, therapy, and prognosis are now possible, thanks to the availability\nof RNA sequencing tools capable of recording gene expression data. Molecular\nsubtyping being closely related to devising clinical strategy and prognosis,\nthis paper focuses on the use of gene expression data for the classification of\nbreast cancer into four subtypes, namely, Basal, Her2, LumA, and LumB. In stage\n1, we suggested a deep learning-based model that uses an autoencoder to reduce\ndimensionality. The size of the feature set is reduced from 20,530 gene\nexpression values to 500 by using an autoencoder. This encoded representation\nis passed to the deep neural network of the second stage for the classification\nof patients into four molecular subtypes of breast cancer. By deploying the\ncombined network of stages 1 and 2, we have been able to attain a mean 10-fold\ntest accuracy of 0.907 on the TCGA breast cancer dataset. The proposed\nframework is fairly robust throughout 10 different runs, as shown by the\nboxplot for classification accuracy. Compared to related work reported in the\nliterature, we have achieved a competitive outcome. In conclusion, the proposed\ntwo-stage deep learning-based model is able to accurately classify four breast\ncancer subtypes, highlighting the autoencoder's capacity to deduce the compact\nrepresentation and the neural network classifier's ability to correctly label\nbreast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Visible light communication (VLC) has been recognized as a promising\ntechnology for handling the continuously increasing quality of service and\nconnectivity requirements in modern wireless communications, particularly in\nindoor scenarios. In this context, the present work considers the integration\nof two distinct modulation schemes, namely spatial modulation (SM) with space\ntime block codes (STBCs), aiming at improving the overall VLC system\nreliability. Based on this and in order to further enhance the achievable\ntransmission data rate, we integrate quasi-orthogonal STBC (QOSTBC) with SM,\nsince relaxing the orthogonality condition of OSTBC ultimately provides a\nhigher coding rate. Then, we generalize the developed results to any number of\nactive light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and any M-ary pulse amplitude modulation\nsize. Furthermore, we derive a tight and tractable upper bound for the\ncorresponding bit error rate (BER) by considering a simple two-step decoding\nprocedure to detect the indices of the transmitting LEDs and then decode the\nsignal domain symbols. Notably, the obtained results demonstrate that QOSTBC\nwith SM enhances the achievable BER compared to SM with repetition coding\n(RC-SM). Finally, we compare STBC-SM with both multiple active SM (MASM) and\nRC-SM in terms of the achievable BER and overall data rate, which further\njustifies the usefulness of the proposed scheme.",

To further enhance CLIP's few-shot capability,\nCLIP-Adapter proposed to fine-tune a lightweight residual feature adapter and\nsignificantly improves the performance for few-shot classification.

In this\npaper, we propose \\textbf{T}raining-Free CL\\textbf{IP}-\\textbf{Adapter}\n(\\textbf{Tip-Adapter}), which not only inherits CLIP's training-free advantage\nbut also performs comparably or even better than CLIP-Adapter. Tip-Adapter does\nnot require any back propagation for training the adapter, but creates the\nweights by a key-value cache model constructed from the few-shot training set.\nIn this non-parametric manner, Tip-Adapter acquires well-performed adapter\nweights without any training, which is both efficient and effective. Moreover,\nthe performance of Tip-Adapter can be further boosted by fine-tuning such\nproperly initialized adapter for only a few epochs with super-fast convergence\nspeed. We conduct extensive experiments of few-shot classification on ImageNet\nand other 10 datasets to demonstrate the superiority of proposed Tip-Adapter.\nThe code will be released at \\url{https://github.com/gaopengcuhk/Tip-Adapter}.",

    "abstract": "Small-size robots offer access to spaces that are inaccessible to larger\nones. This type of access is crucial in applications such as drug delivery,\nenvironmental detection, and collection of small samples. However, there are\nsome tasks that are not possible to perform using only one robot including\nassembly and manufacturing at small scales, manipulation of micro- and nano-\nobjects, and robot-based structuring of small-scale materials. The solution to\nthis problem is to use a group of robots as a system. Thus, we focus on tasks\nthat can be achieved using a group of small-scale robots. These robots are\ntypically externally actuated due to their size limitation. Yet, one faces the\nchallenge of controlling a group of robots using a single global input. We\npropose a control algorithm to position individual members of a swarm in\npredefined positions. A single control input applies to the system and moves\nall robots in the same direction. We also add another control modality by using\ndifferent length robots. An electromagnetic coil system applied external force\nand steered the millirobots. This millirobot can move in various modes of\nmotion such as pivot walking and tumbling. We propose two new designs of these\nmillirobots. In the first design, the magnets are placed at the center of body\nto reduce the magnetic attraction force. In the second design, the millirobots\nare of identical length with two extra legs acting as the pivot points. This\nway we vary pivot separation in design to take advantage of variable speed in\npivot walking mode while keeping the speed constant in tumbling mode. This\npaper presents a general algorithm for positional control of n millirobots with\ndifferent lengths to move them from given initial positions to final desired\nones. This method is based on choosing a leader that is fully controllable.\nSimulations and hardware experiments validate these results.",

We showed that our magnetically actuated millirobot is highly\nagile and can perform a variety of locomotive tasks such as pivot walking and\ntumbling in a horizontal plane. Here, we focus on controlling the locomotion\noutcomes of this millirobot in the pivot walking mode. A mathematical model of\nthe system is developed and the kinematic model is derived. The role of the\nsweep and tilt angles in the robot's motion is also investigated. We propose\ntwo controllers to regulate the gait of the pivot walker. The first one is a\nproportional-geometric controller, which determines the correct pivot point\nthat the millirobot should use. Then, it regulates the angular velocity\nproportionally based on the error between the center of the millirobot and the\nreference trajectory. The second controller is based on a gradient descent\noptimization technique, which expresses the control action as an optimization\nproblem. These control algorithms enable the millirobot to generate a stable\ngait while tracking the desired trajectory. We conduct a set of different\nexperiments and simulation runs to establish the effectiveness of proposed\ncontrollers for different sweep and tilt angles in terms of the tracking error.\nThe two controllers exhibit an appropriate performance, but it is observed that\ngradient descent based controller yields faster convergence time, smaller\ntracking error, and fewer number of steps. Finally, we perform an extensive\nexperimentally parametric analysis on the effect of the sweep angle, tilt\nangle, and step time on the tracking error. As we expect, the\noptimization-based controller outperforms the geometric based controller.",

One of the most common OPE techniques that provides\nunbiased estimates is trajectory based importance sampling (IS). However, due\nto the high variance of trajectory IS estimates, importance sampling methods\nbased on state-action visitation distributions (SIS) have recently been\nadopted. Unfortunately, while SIS often provides lower variance estimates for\nlong horizons, estimating the state-action distribution ratios can be\nchallenging and lead to biased estimates. In this paper, we present a new\nperspective on this bias-variance trade-off and show the existence of a\nspectrum of estimators whose endpoints are SIS and IS. Additionally, we also\nestablish a spectrum for doubly-robust and weighted version of these\nestimators.

    "abstract": "In reinforcement learning, continuous time is often discretized by a time\nscale $\\delta$, to which the resulting performance is known to be highly\nsensitive. In this work, we seek to find a $\\delta$-invariant algorithm for\npolicy gradient (PG) methods, which performs well regardless of the value of\n$\\delta$. We first identify the underlying reasons that cause PG methods to\nfail as $\\delta \\to 0$, proving that the variance of the PG estimator can\ndiverge to infinity in stochastic environments under a certain assumption of\nstochasticity. While durative actions or action repetition can be employed to\nhave $\\delta$-invariance, previous action repetition methods cannot immediately\nreact to unexpected situations in stochastic environments.

Like the\nprevious members of the family, it comes with a complete axiomatisation, which\nmeans it can be used to reason about the corresponding semantic domain purely\nequationally, forgetting the set-theoretic interpretation. We show completeness\nusing a single axiom on top of Graphical Polyhedral Algebra, and show that this\nextension is the smallest that can capture a variety of relevant constructs.\nFinally, we showcase its use by modelling the behaviour of stateless electronic\ncircuits of ideal elements, a domain that had remained outside the remit of\nprevious diagrammatic languages.",

    "abstract": "We study revenue maximization in multi-item multi-bidder auctions under the\nnatural item-independence assumption - a classical problem in Multi-Dimensional\nBayesian Mechanism Design. One of the biggest challenges in this area is\ndeveloping algorithms to compute (approximately) optimal mechanisms that are\nnot brute-force in the size of the bidder type space, which is usually\nexponential in the number of items in multi-item auctions. Unfortunately, such\nalgorithms were only known for basic settings of our problem when bidders have\nunit-demand [CHMS10,CMS15] or additive valuations [Yao15].\nIn this paper, we significantly improve the previous results and design the\nfirst algorithm that runs in time polynomial in the number of items and the\nnumber of bidders to compute mechanisms that are $O(1)$-approximations to the\noptimal revenue when bidders have XOS valuations, resolving the open problem\nraised in [CM16,CZ17]. Moreover, the computed mechanism has a simple structure:\nIt is either a posted price mechanism or a two-part tariff mechanism. As a\ncorollary of our result, we show how to compute an approximately optimal and\nsimple mechanism efficiently using only sample access to the bidders' value\ndistributions. Our algorithm builds on two innovations that allow us to search\nover the space of mechanisms efficiently: (i) a new type of succinct\nrepresentation of mechanisms - the marginal reduced forms, and (ii) a novel\nLift-and-Round procedure that concavifies the problem.",

In\nthe study, Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers (BERT), which\nis a frequently preferred method for solving the classification problem in the\nfield of natural language processing, is used. By solving classification\nproblems through a single model to be used in a chatbot architecture, it is\naimed to alleviate the load on the server that will be created by more than one\nmodel used for solving more than one classification problem. At this point,\nwith the masking method applied during the estimation of a single BERT model,\nwhich was created for classification in more than one subject, the estimation\nof the model was provided on a problem-based basis. Three separate data sets\ncovering different fields from each other are divided by various methods in\norder to complicate the problem, and classification problems that are very\nclose to each other in terms of field are also included in this way.

We obtain faster dynamic algorithms against an adaptive\nadversary and separation results between what is achievable in the oblivious\nvs. adaptive settings. To get these results we exploit techniques from\ndifferential privacy, cryptography, and adaptive data analysis.\nWe give a general reduction transforming a dynamic algorithm against an\noblivious adversary to a dynamic algorithm robust against an adaptive\nadversary. This reduction maintains several copies of the oblivious algorithm\nand uses differential privacy to protect their random bits. Using this\nreduction we obtain dynamic algorithms against an adaptive adversary with\nimproved update and query times for global minimum cut, all pairs distances,\nand all pairs effective resistance.\nWe further improve our update and query times by showing how to maintain a\nsparsifier over an expander decomposition that can be refreshed fast. This fast\nrefresh enables it to be robust against what we call a blinking adversary that\ncan observe the output of the algorithm only following refreshes. We believe\nthat these techniques will prove useful for additional problems.\nOn the flip side, we specify dynamic problems that, assuming a random oracle,\nevery dynamic algorithm that solves them against an adaptive adversary must be\npolynomially slower than a rather straightforward dynamic algorithm that solves\nthem against an oblivious adversary.

One type of hardware Trojans leverages the don't care transitions in\nFinite State Machines (FSMs) of hardware designs. In this paper, we present a\nsymbolic approach to detecting don't care transitions and the hidden Trojans.\nOur detection approach works at both RTL and gate-level, does not require a\ngolden design, and works in three stages. In the first stage, it explores the\nreachable states. In the second stage, it performs an approximate analysis to\nfind the don't care transitions. In the third stage, it performs a state-space\nexploration from reachable states that have incoming don't care transitions to\nfind behavioral discrepancies with respect to what has been observed in the\nfirst stage. We also present a pruning technique based on the reachability of\nFSM states. We present a methodology that leverages both RTL and gate-level for\nsoundness and efficiency. Specifically, we show that don't care transitions\nmust be detected at the gate-level, i.e., after synthesis has been performed,\nfor soundness. However, under specific conditions, Trojan detection can be\nperformed more efficiently at RTL. Evaluation of our approach on a set of\nbenchmarks from OpenCores and TrustHub and using gate-level representation\ngenerated by two synthesis tools, Yosys and Synopsis Design Compiler (SDC),\nshows that our approach is both efficient (up to 10X speedup w.r.t. no pruning)\nand precise (0% false positives) in detecting don't care transitions and the\nTrojans that leverage them. Additionally, the total analysis time can achieve\nup to 3.40X (using Yosys) and 2.52X (SDC) speedup when synthesis preserves the\nFSM structure and the Trojan detection is performed at RTL.",

Moreover, the\nrate of human-generated descriptions cannot match the speed of video\nproduction. To overcome the increasing gaps in video accessibility, we\ndeveloped a hybrid system of two tools to 1) automatically generate\ndescriptions for videos and 2) provide answers or additional descriptions in\nresponse to user queries on a video. Results from a mixed-methods study with 26\nblind and low vision individuals show that our system significantly improved\nuser comprehension and enjoyment of selected videos when both tools were used\nin tandem. In addition, participants reported no significant difference in\ntheir ability to understand videos when presented with autogenerated\ndescriptions versus human-revised autogenerated descriptions. Our results\ndemonstrate user enthusiasm about the developed system and its promise for\nproviding customized access to videos. We discuss the limitations of the\ncurrent work and provide recommendations for the future development of\nautomated video description tools.",

    "abstract": "Coral reefs play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of the\nmarine ecosystem. Various marine organisms depend on coral reefs for their\nexistence and their natural processes. Coral reefs provide the necessary\nhabitat for reproduction and growth for various exotic species of the marine\necosystem. In this article, we discuss the most important parameters which\ninfluence the lifecycle of coral and coral reefs such as ocean acidification,\ndeoxygenation and other physical parameters such as flow rate and surface area.\nOcean acidification depends on the amount of dissolved Carbon dioxide (CO2).\nThis is due to the release of H+ ions upon the reaction of the dissolved CO2\ngases with the calcium carbonate compounds in the ocean. Deoxygenation is\nanother problem that leads to hypoxia which is characterized by a lesser amount\nof dissolved oxygen in water than the required amount for the existence of\nmarine organisms. In this article, we highlight the importance of physical\nparameters such as flow rate which influence gas exchange, heat dissipation,\nbleaching sensitivity, nutrient supply, feeding, waste and sediment removal,\ngrowth and reproduction. In this paper, we also bring out these important\nparameters and propose an ensemble machine learning-based model for analyzing\nthese parameters and provide better rates that can help us to understand and\nsuitably improve the ocean composition which in turn can eminently improve the\nsustainability of the marine ecosystem, mainly the coral reefs",

    "abstract": "We develop a quantitative theory on an escape problem of a stochastic\ngradient descent (SGD) algorithm and investigate the effect of sharpness of\nloss surfaces on the escape. Deep learning has achieved tremendous success in\nvarious domains, however, it has opened up various theoretical open questions.\nOne of the typical questions is why an SGD can find parameters that generalize\nwell over non-convex loss surfaces. An escape problem is an approach to tackle\nthis question, which investigates how efficiently an SGD escapes from local\nminima. In this paper, we develop a quasi-potential theory for the escape\nproblem, by applying a theory of stochastic dynamical systems. We show that the\nquasi-potential theory can handle both geometric properties of loss surfaces\nand a covariance structure of gradient noise in a unified manner, while they\nhave been separately studied in previous works. Our theoretical results imply\nthat (i) the sharpness of loss surfaces contributes to the slow escape of an\nSGD, and (ii) the SGD's noise structure cancels the effect and exponentially\naccelerates the escape.

    "abstract": "Dynamic taint analysis (DTA) has been widely used in various\nsecurity-relevant scenarios that need to track the runtime information flow of\nprograms. Dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) is a prevalent technique in\nachieving effective dynamic taint tracking on commodity hardware and systems.\nHowever, the significant performance overhead incurred by dynamic taint\nanalysis restricts its usage in production systems. Previous efforts on\nmitigating the performance penalty fall into two categories, parallelizing\ntaint tracking from program execution and abstracting the tainting logic to a\nhigher granularity. Both approaches have only met with limited success.\nIn this work, we propose Sdft, an efficient approach that combines the\nprecision of DBI-based instruction-level taint tracking and the efficiency of\nfunction-level abstract taint propagation. First, we build the library function\nsummaries automatically with reachability analysis on the program dependency\ngraph (PDG) to specify the control- and data dependencies between the input\nparameters, output parameters, and global variables of the target library. Then\nwe derive the taint rules for the target library functions and develop taint\ntracking for library function that is tightly integrated into the\nstate-of-the-art DTA framework Libdft. By applying our approach to the core C\nlibrary functions of glibc, we report an average of 1.58x speed up of the\ntracking performance compared with Libdft64.

One fundamental step is to\nencode a single point location into an embedding space, such that this\nembedding is learning-friendly for downstream machine learning models such as\nsupport vector machines and neural networks. We call this process location\nencoding. However, there lacks a systematic review on the concept of location\nencoding, its potential applications, and key challenges that need to be\naddressed. This paper aims to fill this gap. We first provide a formal\ndefinition of location encoding, and discuss the necessity of location encoding\nfor GeoAI research from a machine learning perspective. Next, we provide a\ncomprehensive survey and discussion about the current landscape of location\nencoding research. We classify location encoding models into different\ncategories based on their inputs and encoding methods, and compare them based\non whether they are parametric, multi-scale, distance preserving, and direction\naware. We demonstrate that existing location encoding models can be unified\nunder a shared formulation framework. We also discuss the application of\nlocation encoding for different types of spatial data.

We tackle this\nproblem through online adaptation, gradually correcting the model bias during\ntesting.

Second,\nnon-stationary data distribution makes it difficult to strike a balance between\nfitting regular frames and hard samples with severe occlusions or dramatic\nchanges. To this end, we propose the Dynamic Bilevel Online Adaptation\nalgorithm (DynaBOA).

DynaBOA provides\nadditional 3D guidance by co-training with similar source examples retrieved\nefficiently despite the distribution shift.

The choice of activation function is\na crucial hyperparameter that determines the performance of deep neural\nnetworks. It significantly affects the gradient flow, speed of training and\nultimately the representation power of the neural network. Saturating\nactivation functions like sigmoids suffer from the vanishing gradient problem\nand cannot be used in deep neural networks. Universal approximation theorems\nguarantee that multilayer networks of sigmoids and ReLU can learn arbitrarily\ncomplex continuous functions to any accuracy. Despite the ability of multilayer\nneural networks to learn arbitrarily complex activation functions, each neuron\nin a conventional neural network (networks using sigmoids and ReLU like\nactivations) has a single hyperplane as its decision boundary and hence makes a\nlinear classification. Thus single neurons with sigmoidal, ReLU, Swish, and\nMish activation functions cannot learn the XOR function. Recent research has\ndiscovered biological neurons in layers two and three of the human cortex\nhaving oscillating activation functions and capable of individually learning\nthe XOR function. The presence of oscillating activation functions in\nbiological neural neurons might partially explain the performance gap between\nbiological and artificial neural networks.

However, conventional approaches easily lose image details and tend\nto produce unpleasant artifacts during style transfer. In this paper, to solve\nthese problems, a novel artistic stylization method with target feature\npalettes is proposed, which can transfer key features accurately. Specifically,\nour method contains two modules, namely feature palette composition (FPC) and\nattention coloring (AC) modules.

The\nfollowing AC module calculates attention maps between content and style images,\nand transfers colors and patterns based on the attention map and the target\npalette. These modules enable the proposed stylization to focus on key features\nand generate plausibly transferred images. Thus, the contributions of the\nproposed method are to propose a novel deep learning-based style transfer\nmethod and present target feature palette and attention coloring modules, and\nprovide in-depth analysis and insight on the proposed method via exhaustive\nablation study.

    "abstract": "Finite-state dimension, introduced early in this century as a finite-state\nversion of Hausdorff dimension, is a quantitative measure of the lower\nasymptotic density of information in an infinite sequence over a finite\nalphabet, as perceived by finite automata. It is a robust concept with\nequivalent formulations in terms of finite-state gambling, finite-state data\ncompression, finite-state prediction, entropy rates, and Kolmogorov complexity.\nThe 1972 Schnorr-Stimm dichotomy theorem gave the first automata theoretic\ncharacterization of normal sequences, which had been studied in number theory\nsince Borel defined them in 1909. This theorem implies, in present-day\nterminology, that a sequence is normal if and only if it has finite-state\ndimension 1. One of the most powerful classical tools for investigating normal\nnumbers is the 1916 Weyl criterion, which characterizes normality in terms of\nexponential sums. These are well studied objects with connections to other\naspects of analytic number theory, and this has made the Weyl criterion\nespecially fruitful. This raises the question whether the Weyl criterion can be\ngeneralized from finite-state dimension 1 to arbitrary finite-state dimensions,\nthereby making it a quantitative tool for studying data compression,\nprediction, etc.\nThis paper does exactly this. We extend the Weyl criterion to characterize\nevery finite-state dimension. This turns out not to be routine - exponential\nsums may diverge for non-normal numbers. But we characterize finite state\ndimension in terms of the dimensions of subsequence limits of the exponential\nsums. If the exponential sums converge, they converge to the Fourier\ncoefficients of a probability measure whose dimension is precisely the finite\nstate dimension of the sequence. We illustrate some applications, including a\nnew, Fourier analytic, proof of Schnorr and Stimm's landmark result.",

    "title": "Meta-TTS: Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Speaker Adaptive Text-to-Speech",
    "abstract": "Personalizing a speech synthesis system is a highly desired application,\nwhere the system can generate speech with the user's voice with rare enrolled\nrecordings. There are two main approaches to build such a system in recent\nworks: speaker adaptation and speaker encoding. On the one hand, speaker\nadaptation methods fine-tune a trained multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) model\nwith few enrolled samples. However, they require at least thousands of\nfine-tuning steps for high-quality adaptation, making it hard to apply on\ndevices. On the other hand, speaker encoding methods encode enrollment\nutterances into a speaker embedding. The trained TTS model can synthesize the\nuser's speech conditioned on the corresponding speaker embedding. Nevertheless,\nthe speaker encoder suffers from the generalization gap between the seen and\nunseen speakers.\nIn this paper, we propose applying a meta-learning algorithm to the speaker\nadaptation method. More specifically, we use Model Agnostic Meta-Learning\n(MAML) as the training algorithm of a multi-speaker TTS model, which aims to\nfind a great meta-initialization to adapt the model to any few-shot speaker\nadaptation tasks quickly. Therefore, we can also adapt the meta-trained TTS\nmodel to unseen speakers efficiently. Our experiments compare the proposed\nmethod (Meta-TTS) with two baselines: a speaker adaptation method baseline and\na speaker encoding method baseline. The evaluation results show that Meta-TTS\ncan synthesize high speaker-similarity speech from few enrollment samples with\nfewer adaptation steps than the speaker adaptation baseline and outperforms the\nspeaker encoding baseline under the same training scheme. When the speaker\nencoder of the baseline is pre-trained with extra 8371 speakers of data,\nMeta-TTS can still outperform the baseline on LibriTTS dataset and achieve\ncomparable results on VCTK dataset.",

    "abstract": "The single-site dynamics are a canonical class of Markov chains for sampling\nfrom high-dimensional probability distributions, e.g. the ones represented by\ngraphical models.\nWe give a simple and generic parallel algorithm that can faithfully simulate\nsingle-site dynamics. When the chain asymptotically satisfies the\n$\\ell_p$-Dobrushin's condition, specifically, when the Dobrushin's influence\nmatrix has constantly bounded $\\ell_p$-induced operator norm for an arbitrary\n$p\\in[1,\\infty]$, the parallel simulation of $N$ steps of single-site updates\nsucceeds within $O\\left({N}/{n}+\\log n\\right)$ depth of parallel computing\nusing $\\tilde{O}(m)$ processors, where $n$ is the number of sites and $m$ is\nthe size of graphical model. Since the Dobrushin's condition is almost always\nsatisfied asymptotically by mixing chains, this parallel simulation algorithm\nessentially transforms single-site dynamics with optimal $O(n\\log n)$ mixing\ntime to RNC algorithms for sampling. In particular we obtain RNC samplers, for\nthe Ising models on general graphs in the uniqueness regime, and for satisfying\nsolutions of CNF formulas in a local lemma regime. With non-adaptive simulated\nannealing, these RNC samplers can be transformed routinely to RNC algorithms\nfor approximate counting.\nA key step in our parallel simulation algorithm, is a so-called \"universal\ncoupling\" procedure, which tries to simultaneously couple all distributions\nover the same sample space. We construct such a universal coupling, that for\nevery pair of distributions the coupled probability is at least their Jaccard\nsimilarity. We also prove this is optimal in the worst case. The universal\ncoupling and its applications are of independent interests.",

    "abstract": "Grasping is an essential capability for most robots in practical\napplications. Soft robotic grippers are considered as a critical part of\nrobotic grasping and have attracted considerable attention in terms of the\nadvantages of the high compliance and robustness to variance in object\ngeometry; however, they are still limited by the corresponding sensing\ncapabilities and actuation mechanisms. We propose a novel soft gripper that\nlooks like a granary with a compliant snap-through bistable mechanism\nfabricated by integrated mold technology, achieving sensing and actuation\npurely mechanically. In particular, the snap-through bistable structure in the\nproposed gripper allows us to reduce the complexity of the mechanism, control,\nsensing designs since the grasping and sensing behaviors are completely\npassive. The grasping behaviors are automatically motivated once the trigger\nposition of the gripper touches an object and applies sufficient force. To\ngrasp objects with various profiles, the proposed granary soft gripper (GSG) is\ndesigned to be capable of enveloping, pinching and caging grasps. The gripper\nconsists of a chamber palm, a palm cap and three fingers. First, the design of\nthe gripper is analyzed. Then, after the theoretical model is constructed,\nfinite element (FE) simulations are conducted to verify the built model.\nFinally, a series of grasping experiments is carried out to assess the\nsnap-through behavior of the proposed gripper on grasping and sensing. The\nexperimental results illustrate that the proposed gripper can manipulate a\nvariety of soft and rigid objects and remain stable even though it undertakes\nexternal disturbances.",

And this year (2021), with the introduction\nof MLP-Mixer, MLP has re-entered the limelight and has attracted extensive\nresearch from the computer vision community.

To answer this question, this survey aims to provide a comprehensive\noverview of the recent development of vision deep MLP models. Specifically, we\nreview these vision deep MLPs detailedly, from the subtle sub-module design to\nthe global network structure. We compare the receptive field, computational\ncomplexity, and other properties of different network designs in order to have\na clear understanding of the development path of MLPs.

This new\nframework has yielded optimal $O(n \\log n)$ sampling algorithms on\nbounded-degree graphs for a large class of problems throughout the so-called\nuniqueness regime, including, for example, the problems of sampling independent\nsets, matchings, and Ising-model configurations.\nOur main contribution is to relax the bounded-degree assumption that has so\nfar been important in establishing and applying spectral independence. Previous\nmethods for avoiding degree bounds rely on using $L^p$-norms to analyse\ncontraction on graphs with bounded connective constant (Sinclair, Srivastava,\nYin; FOCS'13). The non-linearity of $L^p$-norms is an obstacle to applying\nthese results to bound spectral independence. Our solution is to capture the\n$L^p$-analysis recursively by amortising over the subtrees of the recurrence\nused to analyse contraction. Our method generalises previous analyses that\napplied only to bounded-degree graphs.\nAs a main application of our techniques, we consider the random graph\n$G(n,d/n)$, where the previously known algorithms run in time $n^{O(\\log d)}$\nor applied only to large $d$.

Recently, meta learning has brought new vitality to\nfew-shot learning, making it possible to obtain a classifier with a fair\nperformance using only a few training samples. Here we introduce the concept of\n\\emph{meta-worker}, a machine annotator trained by meta learning for types of\ntasks (i.e., image classification) that are well-fit for AI. Unlike regular\ncrowd workers, meta-workers can be reliable, stable, and more importantly,\ntireless and free. We first cluster unlabeled data and ask crowd workers to\nrepeatedly annotate the instances nearby the cluster centers; we then leverage\nthe annotated data and meta-training datasets to build a cluster of\nmeta-workers using different meta learning algorithms. Subsequently,\nmeta-workers are asked to annotate the remaining crowdsourced tasks. The\nJensen-Shannon divergence is used to measure the disagreement among the\nannotations provided by the meta-workers, which determines whether or not crowd\nworkers should be invited for further annotation of the same task. Finally, we\nmodel meta-workers' preferences and compute the consensus annotation by\nweighted majority voting. Our empirical study confirms that, by combining\nmachine and human intelligence, we can accomplish a crowdsourcing project with\na lower budget than state-of-the-art task assignment methods, while achieving a\nsuperior or comparable quality.",

Specifically, MvP represents skeleton joints as learnable\nquery embeddings and let them progressively attend to and reason over the\nmulti-view information from the input images to directly regress the actual 3D\njoint locations. To improve the accuracy of such a simple pipeline, MvP\npresents a hierarchical scheme to concisely represent query embeddings of\nmulti-person skeleton joints and introduces an input-dependent query adaptation\napproach. Further, MvP designs a novel geometrically guided attention\nmechanism, called projective attention, to more precisely fuse the cross-view\ninformation for each joint. MvP also introduces a RayConv operation to\nintegrate the view-dependent camera geometry into the feature representations\nfor augmenting the projective attention. We show experimentally that our MvP\nmodel outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks while\nbeing much more efficient. Notably, it achieves 92.3% AP25 on the challenging\nPanoptic dataset, improving upon the previous best approach [36] by 9.8%. MvP\nis general and also extendable to recovering human mesh represented by the SMPL\nmodel, thus useful for modeling multi-person body shapes.

    "abstract": "Cross-modal hashing (CMH) is one of the most promising methods in cross-modal\napproximate nearest neighbor search. Most CMH solutions ideally assume the\nlabels of training and testing set are identical. However, the assumption is\noften violated, causing a zero-shot CMH problem. Recent efforts to address this\nissue focus on transferring knowledge from the seen classes to the unseen ones\nusing label attributes. However, the attributes are isolated from the features\nof multi-modal data. To reduce the information gap, we introduce an approach\ncalled LAEH (Label Attributes Embedding for zero-shot cross-modal Hashing).\nLAEH first gets the initial semantic attribute vectors of labels by word2vec\nmodel and then uses a transformation network to transform them into a common\nsubspace. Next, it leverages the hash vectors and the feature similarity matrix\nto guide the feature extraction network of different modalities. At the same\ntime, LAEH uses the attribute similarity as the supplement of label similarity\nto rectify the label embedding and common subspace. Experiments show that LAEH\noutperforms related representative zero-shot and cross-modal hashing methods.",

    "abstract": "Due to the advantage of reducing storage while speeding up query time on big\nheterogeneous data, cross-modal hashing has been extensively studied for\napproximate nearest neighbor search of multi-modal data. Most hashing methods\nassume that training data is class-balanced.However, in practice, real world\ndata often have a long-tailed distribution. In this paper, we introduce a\nmeta-learning based cross-modal hashing method (MetaCMH) to handle long-tailed\ndata. Due to the lack of training samples in the tail classes, MetaCMH first\nlearns direct features from data in different modalities, and then introduces\nan associative memory module to learn the memory features of samples of the\ntail classes. It then combines the direct and memory features to obtain meta\nfeatures for each sample. For samples of the head classes of the long tail\ndistribution, the weight of the direct features is larger, because there are\nenough training data to learn them well; while for rare classes, the weight of\nthe memory features is larger. Finally, MetaCMH uses a likelihood loss function\nto preserve the similarity in different modalities and learns hash functions in\nan end-to-end fashion. Experiments on long-tailed datasets show that MetaCMH\nperforms significantly better than state-of-the-art methods, especially on the\ntail classes.",

Such samplers with infinity-distance guarantees are specifically desired\nfor differentially private optimization as traditional sampling algorithms\nwhich come with total-variation distance or KL divergence bounds are\ninsufficient to guarantee differential privacy. Our main result is an algorithm\nthat outputs a point from a distribution $O(\\varepsilon)$-close to $\\pi$ in\ninfinity-distance and requires\n$O((md+dL^2R^2)\\times(LR+d\\log(\\frac{Rd+LRd}{\\varepsilon r}))\\times\nmd^{\\omega-1})$ arithmetic operations, where $f$ is $L$-Lipschitz, $K$ is\ndefined by $m$ inequalities, is contained in a ball of radius $R$ and contains\na ball of smaller radius $r$, and $\\omega$ is the matrix-multiplication\nconstant. In particular this runtime is logarithmic in $\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}$\nand significantly improves on prior works. Technically, we depart from the\nprior works that construct Markov chains on a\n$\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2}$-discretization of $K$ to achieve a sample with\n$O(\\varepsilon)$ infinity-distance error, and present a method to convert\ncontinuous samples from $K$ with total-variation bounds to samples with\ninfinity bounds. To achieve improved dependence on $d$, we present a\n\"soft-threshold\" version of the Dikin walk which may be of independent\ninterest. Plugging our algorithm into the framework of the exponential\nmechanism yields similar improvements in the running time of $\\varepsilon$-pure\ndifferentially private algorithms for optimization problems such as empirical\nrisk minimization of Lipschitz-convex functions and low-rank approximation,\nwhile still achieving the tightest known utility bounds.",

    "abstract": "Attention-based Transformer models have been increasingly employed for\nautomatic music generation. To condition the generation process of such a model\nwith a user-specified sequence, a popular approach is to take that conditioning\nsequence as a priming sequence and ask a Transformer decoder to generate a\ncontinuation. However, this prompt-based conditioning cannot guarantee that the\nconditioning sequence would develop or even simply repeat itself in the\ngenerated continuation. In this paper, we propose an alternative conditioning\napproach, called theme-based conditioning, that explicitly trains the\nTransformer to treat the conditioning sequence as a thematic material that has\nto manifest itself multiple times in its generation result. This is achieved\nwith two main technical contributions. First, we propose a deep learning-based\napproach that uses contrastive representation learning and clustering to\nautomatically retrieve thematic materials from music pieces in the training\ndata. Second, we propose a novel gated parallel attention module to be used in\na sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) encoder/decoder architecture to more\neffectively account for a given conditioning thematic material in the\ngeneration process of the Transformer decoder.

In many applications,\nlearning participant communication rounds benefit from collecting their own\nprivate data sets, teaching detailed machine learning models on the real data,\nand sharing the benefits of using these models. Due to existing privacy and\nsecurity concerns, most people avoid sensitive data sharing for training.\nWithout each user demonstrating their local data to a central server, Federated\nLearning allows various parties to train a machine learning algorithm on their\nshared data jointly. This method of collective privacy learning results in the\nexpense of important communication during training.

    "abstract": "Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning (MIML) models complex objects (bags),\neach of which is associated with a set of interrelated labels and composed with\na set of instances. Current MIML solutions still focus on a single-type of\nobjects and assumes an IID distribution of training data. But these objects are\nlinked with objects of other types, %(i.e., pictures in Facebook link with\nvarious users), which also encode the semantics of target objects. In addition,\nthey generally need abundant labeled data for training. To effectively mine\ninterdependent MIML objects of different types, we propose a network embedding\nand meta learning based approach (MetaMIML). MetaMIML introduces the context\nlearner with network embedding to capture semantic information of objects of\ndifferent types, and the task learner to extract the meta knowledge for fast\nadapting to new tasks. In this way, MetaMIML can naturally deal with MIML\nobjects at data level improving, but also exploit the power of meta-learning at\nthe model enhancing. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nMetaMIML achieves a significantly better performance than state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.",

A recent resurgence of interest has\ndeveloped in utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) together with synaptic\nplasticity for intra-lifetime learning. Plasticity has been shown to improve\nthe learning capabilities of these networks in generalizing to novel\nenvironmental circumstances. However, the long-term stability of these trained\nnetworks has yet to be examined. This work demonstrates that utilizing\nplasticity together with ANNs leads to instability beyond the pre-specified\nlifespan used during training. This instability can lead to the dramatic\ndecline of reward seeking behavior, or quickly lead to reaching environment\nterminal states. This behavior is shown to hold consistent for several\nplasticity rules on two different environments across many training\ntime-horizons: a cart-pole balancing problem and a quadrupedal locomotion\nproblem.

    "abstract": "A wide range of applications require learning image generation models whose\nlatent space effectively captures the high-level factors of variation present\nin the data distribution. The extent to which a model represents such\nvariations through its latent space can be judged by its ability to interpolate\nbetween images smoothly. However, most generative models mapping a fixed prior\nto the generated images lead to interpolation trajectories lacking smoothness\nand containing images of reduced quality. In this work, we propose a novel\ngenerative model that learns a flexible non-parametric prior over interpolation\ntrajectories, conditioned on a pair of source and target images. Instead of\nrelying on deterministic interpolation methods (such as linear or spherical\ninterpolation in latent space), we devise a framework that learns a\ndistribution of trajectories between two given images using Latent Second-Order\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations. Through a hybrid combination of\nreconstruction and adversarial losses, the generator is trained to map the\nsampled points from these trajectories to sequences of realistic images that\nsmoothly transition from the source to the target image. Through comprehensive\nqualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate our approach's\neffectiveness in generating images of improved quality as well as its ability\nto learn a diverse distribution over smooth interpolation trajectories for any\npair of real source and target images.",

    "abstract": "The known constructions of negligible error (non-malleable) two-source\nextractors can be broadly classified in three categories:\n(1) Constructions where one source has min-entropy rate about $1/2$, the\nother source can have small min-entropy rate, but the extractor doesn't\nguarantee non-malleability.\n(2) Constructions where one source is uniform, and the other can have small\nmin-entropy rate, and the extractor guarantees non-malleability when the\nuniform source is tampered.\n(3) Constructions where both sources have entropy rate very close to $1$ and\nthe extractor guarantees non-malleability against the tampering of both\nsources.\nWe introduce a new notion of collision resistant extractors and in using it\nwe obtain a strong two source non-malleable extractor where we require the\nfirst source to have $0.8$ entropy rate and the other source can have\nmin-entropy polylogarithmic in the length of the source.\nWe show how the above extractor can be applied to obtain a non-malleable\nextractor with output rate $\\frac 1 2$, which is optimal. We also show how, by\nusing our extractor and extending the known protocol, one can obtain a privacy\namplification secure against memory tampering where the size of the secret\noutput is almost optimal.",

    "abstract": "Ethics is one of the longest standing intellectual endeavors of humanity. In\nrecent years, the fields of AI and NLP have attempted to wrangle with how\nlearning systems that interact with humans should be constrained to behave\nethically. One proposal in this vein is the construction of morality models\nthat can take in arbitrary text and output a moral judgment about the situation\ndescribed. In this work, we focus on a single case study of the recently\nproposed Delphi model and offer a critique of the project's proposed method of\nautomating morality judgments. Through an audit of Delphi, we examine broader\nissues that would be applicable to any similar attempt. We conclude with a\ndiscussion of how machine ethics could usefully proceed, by focusing on current\nand near-future uses of technology, in a way that centers around transparency,\ndemocratic values, and allows for straightforward accountability.",

    "title": "Quantitative Resilience of Generalized Integrators",
    "abstract": "To design critical systems engineers must be able to prove that their system\ncan continue with its mission even after losing control authority over some of\nits actuators. Such a malfunction results in actuators producing possibly\nundesirable inputs over which the controller has real-time readings but no\ncontrol. By definition, a system is resilient if it can still reach a target\nafter a partial loss of control authority. However, after such a malfunction, a\nresilient system might be significantly slower to reach a target compared to\nits initial capabilities. To quantify this loss of performance we introduce the\nnotion of quantitative resilience as the maximal ratio of the minimal times\nrequired to reach any target for the initial and malfunctioning systems. Naive\ncomputation of quantitative resilience directly from the definition is a\ncomplex task as it requires solving four nested, possibly nonlinear,\noptimization problems. The main technical contribution of this work is to\nprovide an efficient method to compute quantitative resilience of control\nsystems with multiple integrators and nonsymmetric input sets. Relying on\ncontrol theory and on two novel geometric results we reduce the computation of\nquantitative resilience to a linear optimization problem. We illustrate our\nmethod on two numerical examples: a trajectory controller for low-thrust\nspacecrafts and a UAV with eight propellers.",

Therefore, unmanned traffic management systems\nare under development to cope with the complexity of future airspace, thereby\nresulting in unprecedented communication needs. Moreover, the increase in the\nnumber of commercial airplanes pushes the limits of voice-oriented\ncommunications, and future options such as single-pilot operations demand\nrobust connectivity. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review and\nvision for enabling the connectivity applications of aerial vehicles utilizing\ncurrent and future communication technologies. We begin by categorizing the\nconnectivity use cases per aerial vehicle and analyzing their connectivity\nrequirements. By reviewing more than 500 related studies, we aim for a\ncomprehensive approach to cover wireless communication technologies, and\nprovide an overview of recent findings from the literature toward the\npossibilities and challenges of employing the wireless communication standards.\nAfter analyzing the network architectures, we list the open-source testbed\nplatforms to facilitate future investigations. This study helped us observe\nthat while numerous works focused on cellular technologies for aerial\nplatforms, a single wireless technology is not sufficient to meet the stringent\nconnectivity demands of the aerial use cases. We identified the need of further\ninvestigations on multi-technology network architectures to enable robust\nconnectivity in the sky.

    "title": "Towards Verifiable Remote Voting with Paper Assurance",
    "abstract": "We propose a protocol for verifiable remote voting with paper assurance. It\nis intended to augment existing postal voting procedures, allowing a ballot to\nbe electronically constructed, printed on paper, then returned in the post. It\nallows each voter to verify that their vote has been correctly cast, recorded\nand tallied by the Electoral Commission. The system is not end-to-end\nverifiable, but does allow voters to detect manipulation by an adversary who\ncontrols either the voting device, or (the postal service and electoral\ncommission) but not both. The protocol is not receipt-free, but if the client\nhonestly follows the protocol (including possibly remembering everything), they\ncannot subsequently prove how they voted. Our proposal is the first to combine\nplain paper assurance with cryptographic verification in a (passively)\nreceipt-free manner.",

    "title": "Access Management in Joint Sensing and Communication Systems: Efficiency  versus Fairness",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a distributed joint sensing and communication\n(DJSC) system in which multiple radar sensors are deployed. Each sensor is\nequipped with a sensing function and a communication function, and thus it is a\nJSC node. The JSC nodes are able to perform sensing their surrounding\nenvironments, e.g., weather conditions or available spectrum. Furthermore, they\ncan cooperatively detect and track a common target. The information, i.e., of\nthe environment and target, collected by the JSC nodes is transmitted to a base\nstation (BS) for further processing. As such, different aspects of the target\nto be viewed simultaneously, which significantly improves the performance of\nthe target detection and tracking. However, both the sensing function and\ncommunication function require a certain amount of bandwidth for their\noperations, and deploying multiple JSC nodes may consume a large amount of\nbandwidth. Therefore, we investigate the bandwidth allocation problem for the\nDJSC system. In particular, we aim to optimize the bandwidth allocation to the\nsensing function and the communication function of the JSC nodes. To improve\nthe allocation efficiency while benefiting the spatial diversity advantage of\nthe DJSC systems, the objective is to maximize the sum of sensing performances,\ni.e., estimation rates, communication performances, i.e., communication data\nrates, and fairnesses of all the users. The optimization problem is non-convex\nand difficult to be solved. For this, we propose a fully polynomial time\napproximation algorithm, and we prove that the approximation algorithm can\nguarantee a near-optimal solution with an accuracy bound of $\\epsilon$.\nFurthermore, we propose to use a heuristic algorithm with lower complexity. The\nsimulation results show that both the proposed algorithms are able to achieve\nthe solutions close to the optimum in a computationally efficient fashion.",

    "abstract": "Semiconductor design houses rely on third-party foundries to manufacture\ntheir integrated circuits (IC). While this trend allows them to tackle\nfabrication costs, it introduces security concerns as external (and potentially\nmalicious) parties can access critical parts of the designs and steal or modify\nthe Intellectual Property (IP). Embedded FPGA (eFPGA) redaction is a promising\ntechnique to protect critical IPs of an ASIC by \\textit{redacting} (i.e.,\nremoving) critical parts and mapping them onto a custom reconfigurable fabric.\nOnly trusted parties will receive the correct bitstream to restore the redacted\nfunctionality. While previous studies imply that using an eFPGA is a sufficient\ncondition to provide security against IP threats like reverse-engineering,\nwhether this truly holds for all eFPGA architectures is unclear, thus\nmotivating the study in this paper. We examine the security of eFPGA fabrics\ngenerated by varying different FPGA design parameters. We characterize the\npower, performance, and area (PPA) characteristics and evaluate each fabric's\nresistance to SAT-based bitstream recovery. Our results encourage designers to\nwork with custom eFPGA fabrics rather than off-the-shelf commercial FPGAs and\nreveals that only considering a redaction fabric's bitstream size is inadequate\nfor gauging security.",

Due to\nthe limited accuracy of 3D feature matching techniques, outliers may exist,\nsometimes even in very large numbers, among the correspondences. Since existing\nrobust solvers may encounter high computational cost or restricted robustness,\nwe propose a novel, fast and highly robust solution, named VOCRA (VOting with\nCost function and Rotating Averaging), for the point cloud registration problem\nwith extreme outlier rates. Our first contribution is to employ the Tukey's\nBiweight robust cost to introduce a new voting and correspondence sorting\ntechnique, which proves to be rather effective in distinguishing true inliers\nfrom outliers even with extreme (99%) outlier rates. Our second contribution\nconsists in designing a time-efficient consensus maximization paradigm based on\nrobust rotation averaging, serving to seek inlier candidates among the\ncorrespondences. Finally, we apply Graduated Non-Convexity with Tukey's\nBiweight (GNC-TB) to estimate the correct transformation with the inlier\ncandidates obtained, which is then used to find the complete inlier set. Both\nstandard benchmarking and realistic experiments with application to two\nreal-data problems are conducted, and we show that our solver VOCRA is robust\nagainst over 99% outliers and more time-efficient than the state-of-the-art\ncompetitors.",

Effective strategies and approaches, \\textit{e.g.}\nre-weighting, or loss correction, are designed to alleviate the negative impact\nof label noise when training a neural network. Those existing works usually\nrely on the pre-specified architecture and manually tuning the additional\nhyper-parameters. In this paper, we propose warped probabilistic inference\n(WarPI) to achieve adaptively rectifying the training procedure for the\nclassification network within the meta-learning scenario. In contrast to the\ndeterministic models, WarPI is formulated as a hierarchical probabilistic model\nby learning an amortization meta-network, which can resolve sample ambiguity\nand be therefore more robust to serious label noise. Unlike the existing\napproximated weighting function of directly generating weight values from\nlosses, our meta-network is learned to estimate a rectifying vector from the\ninput of the logits and labels, which has the capability of leveraging\nsufficient information lying in them. This provides an effective way to rectify\nthe learning procedure for the classification network, demonstrating a\nsignificant improvement of the generalization ability. Besides, modeling the\nrectifying vector as a latent variable and learning the meta-network can be\nseamlessly integrated into the SGD optimization of the classification network.\nWe evaluate WarPI on four benchmarks of robust learning with noisy labels and\nachieve the new state-of-the-art under variant noise types.

We view Federated Learning\nproblem primarily from a communication perspective and allow more device level\ncomputations to save transmission costs. We point out a fundamental dilemma, in\nthat the minima of the local-device level empirical loss are inconsistent with\nthose of the global empirical loss. Different from recent prior works, that\neither attempt inexact minimization or utilize devices for parallelizing\ngradient computation, we propose a dynamic regularizer for each device at each\nround, so that in the limit the global and device solutions are aligned. We\ndemonstrate both through empirical results on real and synthetic data as well\nas analytical results that our scheme leads to efficient training, in both\nconvex and non-convex settings, while being fully agnostic to device\nheterogeneity and robust to large number of devices, partial participation and\nunbalanced data.",

    "abstract": "In many visual systems, visual tracking often bases on RGB image sequences,\nin which some targets are invalid in low-light conditions, and tracking\nperformance is thus affected significantly. Introducing other modalities such\nas depth and infrared data is an effective way to handle imaging limitations of\nindividual sources, but multi-modal imaging platforms usually require elaborate\ndesigns and cannot be applied in many real-world applications at present.\nNear-infrared (NIR) imaging becomes an essential part of many surveillance\ncameras, whose imaging is switchable between RGB and NIR based on the light\nintensity. These two modalities are heterogeneous with very different visual\nproperties and thus bring big challenges for visual tracking. However, existing\nworks have not studied this challenging problem. In this work, we address the\ncross-modal object tracking problem and contribute a new video dataset,\nincluding 654 cross-modal image sequences with over 481K frames in total, and\nthe average video length is more than 735 frames. To promote the research and\ndevelopment of cross-modal object tracking, we propose a new algorithm, which\nlearns the modality-aware target representation to mitigate the appearance gap\nbetween RGB and NIR modalities in the tracking process. It is plug-and-play and\ncould thus be flexibly embedded into different tracking frameworks. Extensive\nexperiments on the dataset are conducted, and we demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed algorithm in two representative tracking frameworks against 17\nstate-of-the-art tracking methods. We will release the dataset for free\nacademic usage, dataset download link and code will be released soon.",

    "abstract": "The parameterization of open and closed anatomical surfaces is of fundamental\nimportance in many biomedical applications. Spherical harmonics, a set of basis\nfunctions defined on the unit sphere, are widely used for anatomical shape\ndescription. However, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the\nobject surface and the entire unit sphere may induce a large geometric\ndistortion in case the shape of the surface is too different from a perfect\nsphere. In this work, we propose adaptive area-preserving parameterization\nmethods for simply-connected open and closed surfaces with the target of the\nparameterization being a spherical cap. Our methods optimize the shape of the\nparameter domain along with the mapping from the object surface to the\nparameter domain. The object surface will be globally mapped to an optimal\nspherical cap region of the unit sphere in an area-preserving manner while also\nexhibiting low conformal distortion. We further develop a set of spherical\nharmonics-like basis functions defined over the adaptive spherical cap domain,\nwhich we call the adaptive harmonics. Experimental results show that the\nproposed parameterization methods outperform the existing methods for both open\nand closed anatomical surfaces in terms of area and angle distortion. Surface\ndescription of the object surfaces can be effectively achieved using a novel\ncombination of the adaptive parameterization and the adaptive harmonics. Our\nwork provides a novel way of mapping anatomical surfaces with improved accuracy\nand greater flexibility. More broadly, the idea of using an adaptive parameter\ndomain allows easy handling of a wide range of biomedical shapes.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial patch attack is a family of attack algorithms that perturb a part\nof image to fool a deep neural network model. Existing patch attacks mostly\nconsider injecting adversarial patches at input-agnostic locations: either a\npredefined location or a random location. This attack setup may be sufficient\nfor attack but has considerable limitations when using it for adversarial\ntraining. Thus, robust models trained with existing patch attacks cannot\neffectively defend other adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first propose\nan end-to-end patch attack algorithm, Generative Dynamic Patch Attack (GDPA),\nwhich generates both patch pattern and patch location adversarially for each\ninput image. We show that GDPA is a generic attack framework that can produce\ndynamic/static and visible/invisible patches with a few configuration changes.\nSecondly, GDPA can be readily integrated for adversarial training to improve\nmodel robustness to various adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments on\nVGGFace, Traffic Sign and ImageNet show that GDPA achieves higher attack\nsuccess rates than state-of-the-art patch attacks, while adversarially trained\nmodel with GDPA demonstrates superior robustness to adversarial patch attacks\nthan competing methods.

To mitigate\nthe discriminated model behaviors between different demographic groups, we\nintroduce a novel post-processing method to optimize over multiple fairness\nconstraints through group-aware threshold adaptation. We propose to learn\nadaptive classification thresholds for each demographic group by optimizing the\nconfusion matrix estimated from the probability distribution of a\nclassification model output. As we only need an estimated probability\ndistribution of model output instead of the classification model structure, our\npost-processing model can be applied to a wide range of classification models\nand improve fairness in a model-agnostic manner and ensure privacy. This even\nallows us to post-process existing fairness methods to further improve the\ntrade-off between accuracy and fairness. Moreover, our model has low\ncomputational cost. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis on the convergence\nof our optimization algorithm and the trade-off between accuracy and fairness\nof our method.

    "abstract": "We introduce DMTet, a deep 3D conditional generative model that can\nsynthesize high-resolution 3D shapes using simple user guides such as coarse\nvoxels. It marries the merits of implicit and explicit 3D representations by\nleveraging a novel hybrid 3D representation. Compared to the current implicit\napproaches, which are trained to regress the signed distance values, DMTet\ndirectly optimizes for the reconstructed surface, which enables us to\nsynthesize finer geometric details with fewer artifacts. Unlike deep 3D\ngenerative models that directly generate explicit representations such as\nmeshes, our model can synthesize shapes with arbitrary topology. The core of\nDMTet includes a deformable tetrahedral grid that encodes a discretized signed\ndistance function and a differentiable marching tetrahedra layer that converts\nthe implicit signed distance representation to the explicit surface mesh\nrepresentation. This combination allows joint optimization of the surface\ngeometry and topology as well as generation of the hierarchy of subdivisions\nusing reconstruction and adversarial losses defined explicitly on the surface\nmesh. Our approach significantly outperforms existing work on conditional shape\nsynthesis from coarse voxel inputs, trained on a dataset of complex 3D animal\nshapes.

    "abstract": "A shortcoming of batch reinforcement learning is its requirement for rewards\nin data, thus not applicable to tasks without reward functions. Existing\nsettings for lack of reward, such as behavioral cloning, rely on optimal\ndemonstrations collected from humans. Unfortunately, extensive expertise is\nrequired for ensuring optimality, which hinder the acquisition of large-scale\ndata for complex tasks. This paper addresses the lack of reward in a batch\nreinforcement learning setting by learning a reward function from preferences.\nGenerating preferences only requires a basic understanding of a task. Being a\nmental process, generating preferences is faster than performing\ndemonstrations. So preferences can be collected at scale from non-expert humans\nusing crowdsourcing. This paper tackles a critical challenge that emerged when\ncollecting data from non-expert humans: the noise in preferences. A novel\nprobabilistic model is proposed for modelling the reliability of labels, which\nutilizes labels collaboratively. Moreover, the proposed model smooths the\nestimation with a learned reward function. Evaluation on Atari datasets\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model, followed by an ablation\nstudy to analyze the relative importance of the proposed ideas.",

All of its analysis in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB)\nsetting requires an exact oracle to provide optimal solutions with any input.\nHowever, such an oracle is usually not feasible since many combinatorial\noptimization problems are NP-hard and only approximation oracles are available.\nAn example (Wang and Chen, 2018) has shown the failure of TS to learn with an\napproximation oracle. However, this oracle is uncommon and is designed only for\na specific problem instance. It is still an open question whether the\nconvergence analysis of TS can be extended beyond the exact oracle in CMAB. In\nthis paper, we study this question under the greedy oracle, which is a common\n(approximation) oracle with theoretical guarantees to solve many (offline)\ncombinatorial optimization problems. We provide a problem-dependent regret\nlower bound of order $\\Omega(\\log T/\\Delta^2)$ to quantify the hardness of TS\nto solve CMAB problems with greedy oracle, where $T$ is the time horizon and\n$\\Delta$ is some reward gap.

While\nsymbolic execution of programs containing RegExes appeals to string solvers\nnatively supporting important features of RegEx, such a string solver is\nhitherto missing. In this paper, we propose the first string theory and string\nsolver that natively provide such a support. The key idea of our string solver\nis to introduce a new automata model, called prioritized streaming string\ntransducers (PSST), to formalize the semantics of RegEx-dependent string\nfunctions. PSSTs combine priorities, which have previously been introduced in\nprioritized finite-state automata to capture greedy/lazy semantics, with string\nvariables as in streaming string transducers to model capturing groups. We\nvalidate the consistency of the formal semantics with the actual JavaScript\nsemantics by extensive experiments. Furthermore, to solve the string\nconstraints, we show that PSSTs enjoy nice closure and algorithmic properties,\nin particular, the regularity-preserving property (i.e., pre-images of regular\nconstraints under PSSTs are regular), and introduce a sound sequent calculus\nthat exploits these properties and performs propagation of regular constraints\nby means of taking post-images or pre-images. Although the satisfiability of\nthe string constraint language is undecidable, we show that our approach is\ncomplete for the so-called straight-line fragment. We evaluate the performance\nof our string solver on over 195000 string constraints generated from an\nopen-source RegEx library.

To tackle this problem, some\nefforts have been paid to use more stable explanation methods or to change\nmodel configurations. In this work, we tackle the problem from the training\nperspective, and propose a new training scheme called Adversarial Training on\nEXplanations (ATEX) to improve the internal explanation stability of a model\nregardless of the specific explanation method being applied. Instead of\ndirectly specifying explanation values over data instances, ATEX only puts\nrequirement on model predictions which avoids involving second-order\nderivatives in optimization. As a further discussion, we also find that\nexplanation stability is closely related to another property of the model,\ni.e., the risk of being exposed to adversarial attack. Through experiments,\nbesides showing that ATEX improves model robustness against manipulation\ntargeting explanation, it also brings additional benefits including smoothing\nexplanations and improving the efficacy of adversarial training if applied to\nthe model.",

This has inspired the EEG\nresearch community to adopt CNN in performing EEG classification tasks.\nHowever, CNNs learned features are not immediately interpretable, causing a\nlack of understanding of the CNNs' internal working mechanism. To improve CNN\ninterpretability, CNN visualization methods are applied to translate the\ninternal features into visually perceptible patterns for qualitative analysis\nof CNN layers. Many CNN visualization methods have been proposed in the\nComputer Vision literature to interpret the CNN network structure, operation,\nand semantic concept, yet applications to EEG data analysis have been limited.\nIn this work we use 3 different methods to extract EEG-relevant features from a\nCNN trained on raw EEG data: optimal samples for each classification category,\nactivation maximization, and reverse convolution. We applied these methods to a\nhigh-performing Deep Learning model with state-of-the-art performance for an\nEEG sex classification task, and show that the model features a difference in\nthe theta frequency band.

However, human\ncan learn new classes quickly even given few samples since human can tell what\ndiscriminative features should be focused on about each category based on both\nthe visual and semantic prior knowledge. To better utilize those prior\nknowledge, we propose the SEmantic Guided Attention (SEGA) mechanism where the\nsemantic knowledge is used to guide the visual perception in a top-down manner\nabout what visual features should be paid attention to when distinguishing a\ncategory from the others. As a result, the embedding of the novel class even\nwith few samples can be more discriminative. Concretely, a feature extractor is\ntrained to embed few images of each novel class into a visual prototype with\nthe help of transferring visual prior knowledge from base classes. Then we\nlearn a network that maps semantic knowledge to category-specific attention\nvectors which will be used to perform feature selection to enhance the visual\nprototypes.

Existing approaches mainly adopt a supervised manner and heavily\nrely on coupled image-report pairs. However, in the medical domain, building a\nlarge-scale image-report paired dataset is both time-consuming and expensive.\nTo relax the dependency on paired data, we propose an unsupervised model\nKnowledge Graph Auto-Encoder (KGAE) which accepts independent sets of images\nand reports in training. KGAE consists of a pre-constructed knowledge graph, a\nknowledge-driven encoder and a knowledge-driven decoder. The knowledge graph\nworks as the shared latent space to bridge the visual and textual domains; The\nknowledge-driven encoder projects medical images and reports to the\ncorresponding coordinates in this latent space and the knowledge-driven decoder\ngenerates a medical report given a coordinate in this space. Since the\nknowledge-driven encoder and decoder can be trained with independent sets of\nimages and reports, KGAE is unsupervised. The experiments show that the\nunsupervised KGAE generates desirable medical reports without using any\nimage-report training pairs. Moreover, KGAE can also work in both\nsemi-supervised and supervised settings, and accept paired images and reports\nin training. By further fine-tuning with image-report pairs, KGAE consistently\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art models on two datasets.",

In this paper, we propose two debiasing strategies, data\ndebiasing and model debiasing, to \"force\" a TSGV model to capture cross-modal\ninteractions. Data debiasing performs data oversampling through video\ntruncation to balance moment temporal distribution in train set. Model\ndebiasing leverages video-only and query-only models to capture the\ndistribution bias, and forces the model to learn cross-modal interactions.\nUsing VSLNet as the base model, we evaluate impact of the two strategies on two\ndatasets that contain out-of-distribution test instances.

However, previous studies, which\nextract features of the whole provenance graph, are not sensitive to the small\nnumber of threat-related entities and thus result in low performance when\nhunting stealthy threats.\nWe present threaTrace, an anomaly-based detector that detects host-based\nthreats at system entity level without prior knowledge of attack patterns. We\ntailor GraphSAGE, an inductive graph neural network, to learn every benign\nentity's role in a provenance graph. threaTrace is a real-time system, which is\nscalable of monitoring a long-term running host and capable of detecting\nhost-based intrusion in their early phase. We evaluate threaTrace on three\npublic datasets. The results show that threaTrace outperforms three\nstate-of-the-art host intrusion detection systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new foundational approach to information theory based\non the concept of the information efficiency of a recursive function, which is\ndefined as the difference between the information in the input and the output.\nThe theory allows us to study planar representations of various infinite\ndomains. Dilation theory studies the information effects of recursive\noperations in terms of topological deformations of the plane. I show that the\nwell-known class of finite sets of natural numbers behaves erratically under\nsuch transformations. It is subject to phase transitions that in some cases\nhave a fractal nature. The class is semi-countable: there is no intrinsic\ninformation theory for this class and there are no efficient methods for\nsystematic search.\nThere is a relation between the information efficiency of the function and\nthe time needed to compute it: a deterministic computational process can\ndestroy information in linear time, but it can only generate information at\nlogarithmic speed. Checking functions for problems in NP are information\ndiscarding. Consequently, when we try to solve a decision problem based on an\nefficiently computable checking function, we need exponential time to\nreconstruct the information destroyed by such a function.\nNP-complete problems are hard because they are defined on semi-countable\ndomains. There is a smaller class of problems, based on countable domains, that\nhas a more transparent structure. One such problem, Subset Bitwise XOR, which\ncould also be described as Multiple Mutual Key Encryption, is shown to be in NP\nbut not in P.

    "abstract": "Wearing a mask has proven to be one of the most effective ways to prevent the\ntransmission of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. However, wearing a mask poses\nchallenges for different face recognition tasks and raises concerns about the\nperformance of masked face presentation detection (PAD). The main issues facing\nthe mask face PAD are the wrongly classified bona fide masked faces and the\nwrongly classified partial attacks (covered by real masks). This work addresses\nthese issues by proposing a method that considers partial attack labels to\nsupervise the PAD model training, as well as regional weighted inference to\nfurther improve the PAD performance by varying the focus on different facial\nareas. Our proposed method is not directly linked to specific network\narchitecture and thus can be directly incorporated into any common or\ncustom-designed network. In our work, two neural networks (DeepPixBis and\nMixFaceNet) are selected as backbones. The experiments are demonstrated on the\ncollaborative real mask attack (CRMA) database. Our proposed method outperforms\nestablished PAD methods in the CRMA database by reducing the mentioned\nshortcomings when facing masked faces. Moreover, we present a detailed\nstep-wise ablation study pointing out the individual and joint benefits of the\nproposed concepts on the overall PAD performance.",

Interdisciplinary research can provide an\neffective solution to complex issues in the related field of coronavirus.\nHowever, whether coronavirus related research becomes more interdisciplinary\nstill needs corroboration. In this study, we investigate interdisciplinary\nstatus of the coronavirus-related fields via the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset\n(CORD-19). To this end, we calculate bibliometric indicators of\ninterdisciplinarity and a co-occurrence analysis method. The results show that\nco-occurrence relationships between cited disciplines have evolved dynamically\nover time. The two types of co-occurrence relationships, Immunology and\nMicrobiology & Medicine and Chemical Engineering & Chemistry, last for a long\ntime in this field during 1990-2020. Moreover, the number of disciplines cited\nby coronavirus-related research increases, whereas the distribution of\ndisciplines is uneven, and this field tends to focus on several dominant\ndisciplines such as Medicine, Immunology and Microbiology, Biochemistry,\nGenetics and Molecular Biology. We also gauge the disciplinary diversity of\nCOVID-19 related papers published from January to December 2020; the\ndisciplinary variety shows an upward trend, while the degree of disciplinary\nbalance shows a downward trend. Meanwhile, the comprehensive index 2Ds\ndemonstrates that the degree of interdisciplinarity in coronavirus field\ndecreases between 1990 and 2019, but it increases in 2020.

However, another IL setting -- IL\nfrom visual inputs (ILfVI), which has a greater promise to be applied in\nreality by utilizing online visual resources, suffers from low data-efficiency\nand poor performance resulted from an on-policy learning manner and\nhigh-dimensional visual inputs. We propose OPIfVI (Off-Policy Imitation from\nVisual Inputs), which is composed of an off-policy learning manner, data\naugmentation, and encoder techniques, to tackle the mentioned challenges,\nrespectively. More specifically, to improve data-efficiency, OPIfVI conducts IL\nin an off-policy manner, with which sampled data can be used multiple times. In\naddition, we enhance the stability of OPIfVI with spectral normalization to\nmitigate the side-effect of off-policy training. The core factor, contributing\nto the poor performance of ILfVI, that we think is the agent could not extract\nmeaningful features from visual inputs. Hence, OPIfVI employs data augmentation\nfrom computer vision to help train encoders that can better extract features\nfrom visual inputs. In addition, a specific structure of gradient\nbackpropagation for the encoder is designed to stabilize the encoder training.\nAt last, we demonstrate that OPIfVI is able to achieve expert-level performance\nand outperform existing baselines no matter visual demonstrations or visual\nobservations are provided via extensive experiments using DeepMind Control\nSuite.",

At each sampling instant, an\nSTC mechanism determines not only the control inputs but also the next sampling\ninstant. In this article, an STC framework for perturbed nonlinear systems is\nproposed. In the framework, a dynamic variable is used in addition to current\nstate information to determine the next sampling instant, rendering the STC\nmechanism dynamic. Using dynamic variables has proven to be powerful for\nincreasing sampling intervals for the closely related concept of\nevent-triggered control, but has so far not been exploited for STC. Two\nvariants of the dynamic STC framework are presented. The first variant can be\nused without further knowledge on the disturbance and leads to guarantees on\ninput-to-state stability. The second variant exploits a known disturbance bound\nto determine sampling instants and guarantees asymptotic stability of a set\ncontaining the origin. In both cases, hybrid Lyapunov function techniques are\nused to derive the respective stability guarantees. Different choices for the\ndynamics of the dynamic variable, that lead to different particular STC\nmechanisms, are presented for both variants of the framework.

In such methods, the cells (or elements) which\nare cut by the interface between two different domains need to be integrated\nusing special techniques in order to obtain optimal convergence rates and\naccurate fluxes across the interface. Adaptive integration technique in which\nthe cells are recursively subdivided is one of the popular techniques for the\nnumerical integration of cut-cells due to its advantages over tessellation,\nparticularly for problems involving complex geometries in three dimensions.\nAlthough adaptive integration does not impose any limitations on the\nrepresentation of the geometry of immersed solids as it requires only point\nlocation algorithms, it becomes computationally expensive for recovering\noptimal convergence rates. This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of\nthe adaptive integration of cut-cells for applications in computational fluid\ndynamics and fluid-structure interaction. We assess the effect of the accuracy\nof integration of cut cells on convergence rates in velocity and pressure\nfields, and then on forces and displacements for fluid-structure interaction\nproblems by studying several examples in two and three dimensions. By taking\nthe computational cost and the accuracy of forces and displacements into\naccount, we demonstrate that numerical results of acceptable accuracy for FSI\nproblems involving laminar flows can be obtained with only fewer levels of\nrefinement.

    "abstract": "CNN-based face recognition models have brought remarkable performance\nimprovement, but they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Recent\nstudies have shown that adversaries can fool the models even if they can only\naccess the models' hard-label output. However, since many queries are needed to\nfind imperceptible adversarial noise, reducing the number of queries is crucial\nfor these attacks. In this paper, we point out two limitations of existing\ndecision-based black-box attacks. We observe that they waste queries for\nbackground noise optimization, and they do not take advantage of adversarial\nperturbations generated for other images. We exploit 3D face alignment to\novercome these limitations and propose a general strategy for query-efficient\nblack-box attacks on face recognition named Geometrically Adaptive Dictionary\nAttack (GADA). Our core idea is to create an adversarial perturbation in the UV\ntexture map and project it onto the face in the image. It greatly improves\nquery efficiency by limiting the perturbation search space to the facial area\nand effectively recycling previous perturbations. We apply the GADA strategy to\ntwo existing attack methods and show overwhelming performance improvement in\nthe experiments on the LFW and CPLFW datasets.

    "abstract": "Organisations increasingly use automated decision-making systems (ADMS) to\ninform decisions that affect humans and their environment. While the use of\nADMS can improve the accuracy and efficiency of decision-making processes, it\nis also coupled with ethical challenges. Unfortunately, the governance\nmechanisms currently used to oversee human decision-making often fail when\napplied to ADMS. In previous work, we proposed that ethics-based auditing\n(EBA), i.e. a structured process by which ADMS are assessed for consistency\nwith relevant principles or norms, can (a) help organisations verify claims\nabout their ADMS and (b) provide decision-subjects with justifications for the\noutputs produced by ADMS. In this article, we outline the conditions under\nwhich EBA procedures can be feasible and effective in practice. First, we argue\nthat EBA is best understood as a 'soft' yet 'formal' governance mechanism. This\nimplies that the main responsibility of auditors should be to spark ethical\ndeliberation at key intervention points throughout the software development\nprocess and ensure that there is sufficient documentation to respond to\npotential inquiries. Second, we frame ADMS as parts of larger socio-technical\nsystems to demonstrate that to be feasible and effective, EBA procedures must\nlink to intervention points that span all levels of organisational governance\nand all phases of the software lifecycle. The main function of EBA should\ntherefore be to inform, formalise, assess, and interlink existing governance\nstructures. Finally, we discuss the policy implications of our findings. To\nsupport the emergence of feasible and effective EBA procedures, policymakers\nand regulators could provide standardised reporting formats, facilitate\nknowledge exchange, provide guidance on how to resolve normative tensions, and\ncreate an independent body to oversee EBA of ADMS.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has established itself as a cornerstone for various\ncritical applications ranging from autonomous driving to authentication\nsystems. However, with this increasing adoption rate of machine learning\nmodels, multiple attacks have emerged. One class of such attacks is training\ntime attack, whereby an adversary executes their attack before or during the\nmachine learning model training. In this work, we propose a new training time\nattack against computer vision based machine learning models, namely model\nhijacking attack. The adversary aims to hijack a target model to execute a\ndifferent task than its original one without the model owner noticing. Model\nhijacking can cause accountability and security risks since a hijacked model\nowner can be framed for having their model offering illegal or unethical\nservices. Model hijacking attacks are launched in the same way as existing data\npoisoning attacks. However, one requirement of the model hijacking attack is to\nbe stealthy, i.e., the data samples used to hijack the target model should look\nsimilar to the model's original training dataset. To this end, we propose two\ndifferent model hijacking attacks, namely Chameleon and Adverse Chameleon,\nbased on a novel encoder-decoder style ML model, namely the Camouflager. Our\nevaluation shows that both of our model hijacking attacks achieve a high attack\nsuccess rate, with a negligible drop in model utility.",

    "title": "GROWL: Group Detection With Link Prediction",
    "abstract": "Interaction group detection has been previously addressed with bottom-up\napproaches which relied on the position and orientation information of\nindividuals. These approaches were primarily based on pairwise affinity\nmatrices and were limited to static, third-person views. This problem can\ngreatly benefit from a holistic approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nbeyond pairwise relationships, due to the inherent spatial configuration that\nexists between individuals who form interaction groups. Our proposed method,\nGROup detection With Link prediction (GROWL), demonstrates the effectiveness of\na GNN based approach. GROWL predicts the link between two individuals by\ngenerating a feature embedding based on their neighbourhood in the graph and\ndetermines whether they are connected with a shallow binary classification\nmethod such as Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs). We test our method against other\nstate-of-the-art group detection approaches on both a third-person view dataset\nand a robocentric (i.e., egocentric) dataset. In addition, we propose a\nmultimodal approach based on RGB and depth data to calculate a representation\nGROWL can utilise as input. Our results show that a GNN based approach can\nsignificantly improve accuracy across different camera views, i.e.,\nthird-person and egocentric views.",

    "abstract": "Easy to construct and optimally convergent generalisations of B-splines to\nunstructured meshes are essential for the application of isogeometric analysis\nto domains with non-trivial topologies. Nonetheless, especially for hexahedral\nmeshes, the construction of smooth and optimally convergent isogeometric\nanalysis basis functions is still an open question. We introduce a simple\npartition of unity construction that yields smooth blended B-splines on\nunstructured quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes. The new basis functions,\nreferred to as SB-splines, are obtained by, first, defining a linearly\nindependent set of mixed smoothness splines that are $C^0$~continuous in the\nunstructured regions of the mesh and have higher smoothness everywhere else.\nNext, globally smooth linearly independent splines are obtained by smoothly\nblending the set of mixed smoothness splines with Bernstein basis functions of\nequal degree. One of the key novelties of our approach is that the required\nsmooth weight functions are obtained from the first set of mixed smoothness\nsplines. The obtained SB-splines are smooth, non-negative, have no breakpoints\nwithin the elements and reduce to conventional B-splines away from the\nextraordinary features in the mesh. Although we consider only quadratic\nB-splines in this paper, the construction carries over to arbitrary degrees. We\ndemonstrate the excellent performance and optimal convergence of the SB-splines\nstudying Poisson and biharmonic problems in one, two and three dimensions.",

The existence of the bias classifier is\nproved an effective training method for the bias classifier is proposed. It is\nproved that by adding a proper random first-degree part to the bias classifier,\nan information-theoretically safe classifier against the original-model\ngradient-based attack is obtained in the sense that the attack generates a\ntotally random direction for generating adversaries. This seems to be the first\ntime that the concept of information-theoretically safe classifier is proposed.\nSeveral attack methods for the bias classifier are proposed and numerical\nexperiments are used to show that the bias classifier is more robust than DNNs\nagainst these attacks in most cases.",

    "abstract": "Random Forests (RFs) are among the state-of-the-art in machine learning and\noffer excellent performance with nearly zero parameter tuning. Remarkably, RFs\nseem to be impervious to overfitting even though their basic building blocks\nare well-known to overfit. Recently, a broadly received study argued that a RF\nexhibits a so-called double-descent curve: First, the model overfits the data\nin a u-shaped curve and then, once a certain model complexity is reached, it\nsuddenly improves its performance again. In this paper, we challenge the notion\nthat model capacity is the correct tool to explain the success of RF and argue\nthat the algorithm which trains the model plays a more important role than\npreviously thought. We show that a RF does not exhibit a double-descent curve\nbut rather has a single descent. Hence, it does not overfit in the classic\nsense. We further present a RF variation that also does not overfit although\nits decision boundary approximates that of an overfitted DT. Similar, we show\nthat a DT which approximates the decision boundary of a RF will still overfit.\nLast, we study the diversity of an ensemble as a tool the estimate its\nperformance. To do so, we introduce Negative Correlation Forest (NCForest)\nwhich allows for precise control over the diversity in the ensemble. We show,\nthat the diversity and the bias indeed have a crucial impact on the performance\nof the RF. Having too low diversity collapses the performance of the RF into a\na single tree, whereas having too much diversity means that most trees do not\nproduce correct outputs anymore. However, in-between these two extremes we find\na large range of different trade-offs with all roughly equal performance.\nHence, the specific trade-off between bias and diversity does not matter as\nlong as the algorithm reaches this good trade-off regime.",

Even worse, the emergence of the COVID-19 Delta variant once again\nputs the world in danger. Fortunately, many countries and companies have\nstarted to develop coronavirus vaccines since the beginning of this disaster.\nTill now, more than 20 vaccines have been approved by the World Health\nOrganization (WHO), bringing light to people besieged by the pandemic. The\npromotion of COVID-19 vaccination around the world also brings a lot of\ndiscussions on social media about different aspects of vaccines, such as\nefficacy and security. However, there does not exist much research work to\nsystematically analyze public opinion towards COVID-19 vaccines. In this study,\nwe conduct an in-depth analysis of tweets related to the coronavirus vaccine on\nTwitter to understand the trending topics and their corresponding sentimental\npolarities regarding the country and vaccine levels. The results show that a\nmajority of people are confident in the effectiveness of vaccines and are\nwilling to get vaccinated. In contrast, the negative tweets are often\nassociated with the complaints of vaccine shortages, side effects after\ninjections and possible death after being vaccinated. Overall, this study\nexploits popular NLP and topic modeling methods to mine people's opinions on\nthe COVID-19 vaccines on social media and to analyse and visualise them\nobjectively. Our findings can improve the readability of the noisy information\non social media and provide effective data support for the government and\npolicy makers.",

It is important to identify these\ndifferent topics and sentiments in order to gauge public opinion, use the\ninsights to develop policies, and make necessary adjustments or actions to\nimprove public image and reputation of the administering agency and the\nCOVID-19 vaccines themselves. This paper proposes a semi-supervised machine\nlearning pipeline to perform topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and an\nanalysis of vaccine brand reputation to obtain an in-depth understanding of\nnational public opinion of Filipinos on Facebook. The methodology makes use of\na multilingual version of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers or BERT for topic modeling, hierarchical clustering, five\ndifferent classifiers for sentiment analysis, and cosine similarity of BERT\ntopic embeddings for vaccine brand reputation analysis. Results suggest that\nany type of COVID-19 misinformation is an emergent property of COVID-19 public\nopinion, and that the detection of COVID-19 misinformation can be an\nunsupervised task. Sentiment analysis aided by hierarchical clustering reveal\nthat 21 of the 25 topics extrapolated by topic modeling are negative topics.\nSuch negative comments spike in count whenever the Department of Health in the\nPhilippines posts about the COVID-19 situation in other countries.\nAdditionally, the high numbers of laugh reactions on the Facebook posts by the\nsame agency -- without any humorous content -- suggest that the reactors of\nthese posts tend to react the way they do, not because of what the posts are\nabout but because of who posted them.",

In this work, we propose a\nSiamese voxel-to-BEV tracker, which can significantly improve the tracking\nperformance in sparse 3D point clouds. Specifically, it consists of a Siamese\nshape-aware feature learning network and a voxel-to-BEV target localization\nnetwork. The Siamese shape-aware feature learning network can capture 3D shape\ninformation of the object to learn the discriminative features of the object so\nthat the potential target from the background in sparse point clouds can be\nidentified. To this end, we first perform template feature embedding to embed\nthe template's feature into the potential target and then generate a dense 3D\nshape to characterize the shape information of the potential target. For\nlocalizing the tracked target, the voxel-to-BEV target localization network\nregresses the target's 2D center and the $z$-axis center from the dense bird's\neye view (BEV) feature map in an anchor-free manner. Concretely, we compress\nthe voxelized point cloud along $z$-axis through max pooling to obtain a dense\nBEV feature map, where the regression of the 2D center and the $z$-axis center\ncan be performed more effectively. Extensive evaluation on the KITTI and\nnuScenes datasets shows that our method significantly outperforms the current\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the implementation of a crossplatform software\napplication to aid ambulance paramedics during CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary\nResuscitation). It must be able to work both on iOS and Android devices, which\nare the leading platforms in the mobile industry. The goal of the application\nis to guide paramedics in the different processes and expected medication to be\nadministered during a cardiac arrest, a scenario that is usually stressful and\nfast-paced, thus prone to errors or distractions. The tool must provide timely\nreminders of the different actions to be performed during a cardiac arrest, and\nin an appropriate order, based on the results of the previous actions. A timer\nfunction will also control the duration of each step of the CPR procedure. The\napplication is implemented in React Native which, using JavaScript as\nprogramming language, allows to deploy applications that can run both in iOS\nand Android native languages. Our solution could also serve as a record of\nevents that could be transmitted (even in real-time) to the hospital without\ndemanding explicit verbal communication of the procedures or medications\nadministered to the patient during the ambulance trip. This would provide even\nhigher efficiency in the process, and would allow automatic incorporation of\nthe events to the medical record of the patient as well.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things, often known as IoT, is an innovative technology that\nconnects digital devices all around us, allowing Machine to Machine (M2M)\ncommunication between digital devices all over the world. Due to the\nconvenience, connectivity, and affordability, this IoT is being served in\nvarious domains including healthcare where it brings exceptional benefits to\nimprove patient care, uplifting medical resources to the next level. Some of\nthese examples include surveillance networks, healthcare delivery technologies,\nand smart thermal detection. As of now, the IoT is served in various aspects of\nhealthcare making many of the medical processes much easier as opposed to the\nearlier times. One of the most important aspects that this IoT can be used is,\nmanaging various aspects of healthcare during global pandemics, as pandemics\ncan bring an immense strain on healthcare resources, during the pandemic. As\nthere is no proper study is done with regards to the proper use of IoT for\nmanaging pandemics, in this regard, through our study we aim to review various\nuse cases of IoT towards managing pandemics especially in terms of COVID-19;\nowing to what we are currently going through. In this regard, we are proposing\na conceptual framework synthesizing the current literature and resources, which\ncan be adopted when managing global pandemics to accelerate the battle pace\nwith these deadly pandemics and focusing on what the entire world is currently\ngoing through where almost more than four (04) million people are diminished of\nthis COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "We provide a novel framework to compute a discrete vector potential of a\ngiven discrete vector field on arbitrary polyhedral meshes. The framework\nexploits the concept of acyclic matching, a combinatorial tool at the core of\ndiscrete Morse theory. We introduce the new concept of complete acyclic\nmatchings and we show that they give the same end result of Gaussian\nelimination. Basically, instead of doing costly row and column operations on a\nsparse matrix, we compute equivalent cheap combinatorial operations that\npreserve the underlying sparsity structure. Currently, the most efficient\nalgorithms proposed in literature to find discrete vector potentials make use\nof tree-cotree techniques. We show that they compute a special type of complete\nacyclic matchings. Moreover, we show that the problem of computing them is\nequivalent to the problem of deciding whether a given mesh has a topological\nproperty called collapsibility. This fact gives a topological characterization\nof well-known termination problems of tree-cotree techniques. We propose a new\nrecursive algorithm to compute discrete vector potentials. It works directly on\nbasis elements of $1$- and $2$-chains by performing elementary Gaussian\noperations on them associated with acyclic matchings. However, the main novelty\nis that it can be applied recursively. Indeed, the recursion process allows us\nto sidetrack termination problems of the standard tree-cotree techniques. We\ntested the algorithm on pathological triangulations with known topological\nobstructions. In all tested problems we observe linear computational complexity\nas a function of mesh size. Moreover, the algorithm is purely graph-based so it\nis straightforward to implement and does not require specialized external\nprocedures. We believe that our framework could offer new perspectives to\nsparse matrix computations.",

    "abstract": "Numerous compression and acceleration strategies have achieved outstanding\nresults on classification tasks in various fields, such as computer vision and\nspeech signal processing. Nevertheless, the same strategies have yielded\nungratified performance on regression tasks because the nature between these\nand classification tasks differs. In this paper, a novel sign-exponent-only\nfloating-point network (SEOFP-NET) technique is proposed to compress the model\nsize and accelerate the inference time for speech enhancement, a regression\ntask of speech signal processing. The proposed method compressed the sizes of\ndeep neural network (DNN)-based speech enhancement models by quantizing the\nfraction bits of single-precision floating-point parameters during training.\nBefore inference implementation, all parameters in the trained SEOFP-NET model\nare slightly adjusted to accelerate the inference time by replacing the\nfloating-point multiplier with an integer-adder. For generalization, the\nSEOFP-NET technique is introduced to different speech enhancement tasks in\nspeech signal processing with different model architectures under various\ncorpora. The experimental results indicate that the size of SEOFP-NET models\ncan be significantly compressed by up to 81.249% without noticeably downgrading\ntheir speech enhancement performance, and the inference time can be accelerated\nto 1.212x compared with the baseline models. The results also verify that the\nproposed SEOFP-NET can cooperate with other efficiency strategies to achieve a\nsynergy effect for model compression. In addition, the just noticeable\ndifference (JND) was applied to the user study experiment to statistically\nanalyze the effect of speech enhancement on listening. The results indicate\nthat the listeners cannot facilely differentiate between the enhanced speech\nsignals processed by the baseline model and the proposed SEOFP-NET.",

A cross-sectional,\nweb-based survey was deployed during August and September, 2020, to practicing\nphysicians in the 18 states with the largest COVID-19 cases. Among 1,478\nresponding physicians, 1,017 completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5). First, the\nPCL-5 was used to compare symptom endorsement between the two physician groups.\nA greater percentage of frontline than second-line physicians had clinically\nsignificant endorsement of PCL-5 symptoms and higher PCL-5 scores. Second,\nlogistic regression and seven nonlinear machine learning (ML) algorithms were\nleveraged to identify potential predictors of PTSD risk by analyzing variable\nimportance and partial dependence plots. Predictors of PTSD risk included\ncognitive/psychological measures, occupational characteristics, work\nexperiences, social support, demographics, and workplace characteristics.\nImportantly, the final ML model random forest, identified patterns of both\ndamaging and protective predictors of PTSD risk among frontline physicians. Key\ndamaging factors included depression, burnout, negative coping, fears of\ncontracting/transmitting COVID-19, perceived stigma, and insufficient resources\nto treat COVID-19 patients. Protective factors included resilience and support\nfrom employers/friends/family/significant others. This study underscores the\nvalue of ML algorithms to uncover nonlinear relationships among\nprotective/damaging risk factors for PTSD in frontline physicians, which may\nbetter inform interventions to prepare healthcare systems for future\nepidemics/pandemics.",

Compared\nto approximation-based methods (e.g., finite element method), the class of\ndiscrete mesh models offers greater flexibility to simulate complex physics and\nshapes in three dimensions; its formulation produces an efficient algorithm\nwhile maintaining coordinate-free geometric descriptions. However, ambiguities\nin geometric definitions in the discrete context have led to a lack of\nconsensus on which discrete mesh model is theoretically and numerically\noptimal; a bijective relationship between the terms contributing to both the\nenergy and forces from the discrete and smooth geometric theories remains to be\nestablished.

    "abstract": "Emotions are multifaceted phenomena that affect our behaviour, perception,\nand cognition. Increasing evidence indicates that induction mechanisms play a\ncrucial role in triggering emotions by simulating the sensations required for\nan experimental design. Over the years, many reviews have evaluated a passive\nelicitation mechanism where the user is an observer, ignoring the importance of\nself-relevance in emotional experience. So, in response to the gap in the\nliterature, this study intends to explore the possibility of using Virtual\nReality (VR) as an active mechanism for emotion induction. Furthermore, for the\nsuccess and quality of research settings, VR must select the appropriate\nmaterial to effectively evoke emotions. Therefore, in the present review, we\nevaluated to what extent VR visual and audio-visual stimuli, games, and tasks,\nand 360-degree panoramas and videos can elicit emotions based on the current\nliterature. Further, we present public datasets generated by VR and\nemotion-sensing interfaces that can be used in VR based research. The\nconclusions of this survey reveal that VR has a great potential to evoke\nemotions effectively and naturally by generating motivational and empathy\nmechanisms which makes it an ecologically valid paradigm to study emotions.",

    "abstract": "The unexpected historical period we are living has abruptly pushed us to\nloosen any sort of interaction between individuals, gradually forcing us to\ndeal with new ways to allow compliance with safety distances; indeed the\npresent situation has demonstrated more than ever how critical it is to be able\nto properly organize our travel plans, put people in safe conditions, and avoid\nharmful circumstances. The aim of this research is to set up a system to\nmonitor the flow of people inside public places and facilities of interest\n(museums, theatres, cinemas, etc.) without collecting personal or sensitive\ndata. Weak monitoring of people flows (i.e. monitoring without personal\nidentification of the monitored subjects) through Internet of Things tools\nmight be a viable solution to minimize lineups and overcrowding. Our study,\nwhich began as an experiment in the Umbria region of Italy, aims to be one of\nseveral answers to automated planning of people's flows in order to make our\nland more liveable. We intend to show that the Internet of Things gives almost\nunlimited tools and possibilities, from developing a basic information process\nto implementing a true portal which enables business people to connect with\ninterested consumers.",

    "abstract": "Peer assessment systems are emerging in many social and multi-agent settings,\nsuch as peer grading in large (online) classes, peer review in conferences,\npeer art evaluation, etc. However, peer assessments might not be as accurate as\nexpert evaluations, thus rendering these systems unreliable. The reliability of\npeer assessment systems is influenced by various factors such as assessment\nability of peers, their strategic assessment behaviors, and the peer assessment\nsetup (e.g., peer evaluating group work or individual work of others). In this\nwork, we first model peer assessment as multi-relational weighted networks that\ncan express a variety of peer assessment setups, plus capture conflicts of\ninterest and strategic behaviors. Leveraging our peer assessment network model,\nwe introduce a graph convolutional network which can learn assessment patterns\nand user behaviors to more accurately predict expert evaluations. Our extensive\nexperiments on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our\nproposed approach, which outperforms existing peer assessment methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the digitization of physical assets using\nblockchain technology focusing on energy and peer-to-peer trading on\ndecentralized energy markets. Because they are forward markets and operate on a\nday-ahead timeline, the energy transactions are settled only at the movement of\nenergy delivery. Having the option of locking the energy tokens by a\nthird-party escrow becomes a highly desirable feature. Thus, we define a\nLockable ERC20 token that provides the option for an owner to lock some of its\ntokens using smart contracts. A time-lock and an escrow party account or smart\ncontract can be specified allowing the tokens to be unlocked when certain\nbusiness conditions are met. For validation purposes, we have considered a\npeer-to-peer energy trading scenario in which the Lockable ERC20 token was used\nto digitize the surplus of energy of prosumers. In this case, the energy tokens\ncommitted in blockchain transactions are successfully locked up until the\nactual delivery of energy, the settlement considering the monitored data of\nenergy meters.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have become the de-facto standard in the natural language\nprocessing (NLP) field. They have also gained momentum in computer vision and\nother domains. Transformers can enable artificial intelligence (AI) models to\ndynamically focus on certain parts of their input and thus reason more\neffectively. Inspired by the success of transformers, we adopted this technique\nto predict strategic flight departure demand in multiple horizons. This work\nwas conducted in support of a MITRE-developed mobile application, Pacer, which\ndisplays predicted departure demand to general aviation (GA) flight operators\nso they can have better situation awareness of the potential for departure\ndelays during busy periods. Field demonstrations involving Pacer's previously\ndesigned rule-based prediction method showed that the prediction accuracy of\ndeparture demand still has room for improvement. This research strives to\nimprove prediction accuracy from two key aspects: better data sources and\nrobust forecasting algorithms. We leveraged two data sources, Aviation System\nPerformance Metrics (ASPM) and System Wide Information Management (SWIM), as\nour input. We then trained forecasting models with temporal fusion transformer\n(TFT) for five different airports. Case studies show that TFTs can perform\nbetter than traditional forecasting methods by large margins, and they can\nresult in better prediction across diverse airports and with better\ninterpretability.",

Code-to-code recommendation is a task in MLOnCode that aims to\nrecommend relevant, diverse and concise code snippets that usefully extend the\ncode currently being written by a developer in their development environment\n(IDE). Code-to-code recommendation engines hold the promise of increasing\ndeveloper productivity by reducing context switching from the IDE and\nincreasing code-reuse. Existing code-to-code recommendation engines do not\nscale gracefully to large codebases, exhibiting a linear growth in query time\nas the code repository increases in size. In addition, existing code-to-code\nrecommendation engines fail to account for the global statistics of code\nrepositories in the ranking function, such as the distribution of code snippet\nlengths, leading to sub-optimal retrieval results. We address both of these\nweaknesses with \\emph{Senatus}, a new code-to-code recommendation engine. At\nthe core of Senatus is \\emph{De-Skew} LSH a new locality sensitive hashing\n(LSH) algorithm that indexes the data for fast (sub-linear time) retrieval\nwhile also counteracting the skewness in the snippet length distribution using\nnovel abstract syntax tree-based feature scoring and selection algorithms.

In this study, we analyze the\nlimitations of the proxy in academic career studies, using as an example the\nentire population of Polish academic scientists visible in the last decade in\nglobal science and holding at least a PhD (N = 20,569). The proxy works well\nfor science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM)\ndisciplines; however, for non-STEMM disciplines (particularly for humanities\nand social sciences), it has a dramatically worse performance. This negative\nconclusion is particularly important for systems that have only become recently\nvisible in global academic journals. The micro-level data suggest a delayed\nparticipation of social scientists and humanists in global science networks,\nwith practical implications for predicting biological age from academic age. We\ncalculate correlation coefficients, present contingency analysis of academic\ncareer stages with academic positions and age groups, and create a linear\nmultivariate regression model.

In addition, the interpretability analysis of the model outputs\nidentifies the important input factors for delay prediction.

The study of underlying THz wireless\npropagation channels provides the foundations for the development of reliable\nTHz communication systems and their applications. This article provides a\ncomprehensive overview of the study of THz wireless channels. First, the three\nmost popular THz channel measurement methodologies, namely, frequency-domain\nchannel measurement based on a vector network analyzer (VNA), time-domain\nchannel measurement based on sliding correlation, and time-domain channel\nmeasurement based on THz pulses from time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), are\nintroduced and compared. Current channel measurement systems and measurement\ncampaigns are reviewed. Then, existing channel modeling methodologies are\ncategorized into deterministic, stochastic, and hybrid approaches.\nState-of-the-art THz channel models are analyzed, and the channel simulators\nthat are based on them are introduced. Next, an in-depth review of channel\ncharacteristics in the THz band is presented. Finally, open problems and future\nresearch directions for research studies on THz wireless channels for 6G are\nelaborated.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation has attracted a large amount of attention in recent\nyears. In robotics, segmentation can be used to identify a region of interest,\nor \\emph{target area}. For example, in the RoboCup Standard Platform League\n(SPL), segmentation separates the soccer field from the background and from\nplayers on the field. For satellite or vehicle applications, it is often\nnecessary to find certain regions such as roads, bodies of water or kinds of\nterrain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to real-time target area\nsegmentation based on a newly designed spatial temporal network. The method\noperates under domain constraints defined by both the robot's hardware and its\noperating environment . The proposed network is able to run in real-time,\nworking within the constraints of limited run time and computing power. This\nwork is compared against other real time segmentation methods on a dataset\ngenerated by a Nao V6 humanoid robot simulating the RoboCup SPL competition. In\nthis case, the target area is defined as the artificial grass field. The method\nis also tested on a maritime dataset collected by a moving vessel, where the\naim is to separate the ocean region from the rest of the image. This dataset\ndemonstrates that the proposed model can generalise to a variety of vision\nproblems.",

One of the most well-known measures is k-shell; additional measures have\nbeen proposed based on it. However, as the same k-shell index may be assigned\nto nodes with different degrees, this measure suffers from low accuracy.

The shared task is divided into two related\nclassification tasks: (i) Task 1: toxicity detection and; (ii) Task 2: toxicity\nlevel detection. They focus on the xenophobic problem exacerbated by the spread\nof toxic comments posted in different online news articles related to\nimmigration. One of the necessary efforts towards mitigating this problem is to\ndetect toxicity in the comments. Our main objective was to implement an\naccurate model to detect xenophobia in comments about web news articles within\nthe DETOXIS shared task 2021, based on the competition's official metrics: the\nF1-score for Task 1 and the Closeness Evaluation Metric (CEM) for Task 2. To\nsolve the tasks, we worked with two types of machine learning models: (i)\nstatistical models and (ii) Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language\nUnderstanding (BERT) models. We obtained our best results in both tasks using\nBETO, an BERT model trained on a big Spanish corpus. We obtained the 3rd place\nin Task 1 official ranking with the F1-score of 0.5996, and we achieved the 6th\nplace in Task 2 official ranking with the CEM of 0.7142.

Such symmetries\nmay be found using symmetry of involution $[-1]$ and symmetry of translation\nmorphism $\\tau_T=P+T$, where $T$ is the $n$-torsion point which naturally\nbelongs to the $E(\\mathbb K)$ for a given elliptic curve model.

We bring up some known compression functions on those models and present\nnew ones as well. For (almost) every presented compression function,\ndifferential addition and point doubling formulas are shown. As in the case of\nhigh-degree compression functions manual investigation of differential addition\nand doubling formulas is very difficult, we came up with a Magma program which\nrelies on the Gr\\\"obner basis.

Moreover, one may find, defined for this compression function,\ndifferential addition and doubling formulas of the same efficiency as\nMontgomery's. However, it seems that for the family of elliptic curves having a\nnatural point of order $3$, compression functions of the same efficiency do not\nexist.",

    "abstract": "Physical interaction between humans and robots can help robots learn to\nperform complex tasks. The robot arm gains information by observing how the\nhuman kinesthetically guides it throughout the task. While prior works focus on\nhow the robot learns, it is equally important that this learning is transparent\nto the human teacher. Visual displays that show the robot's uncertainty can\npotentially communicate this information; however, we hypothesize that visual\nfeedback mechanisms miss out on the physical connection between the human and\nrobot. In this work we present a soft haptic display that wraps around and\nconforms to the surface of a robot arm, adding a haptic signal at an existing\npoint of contact without significantly affecting the interaction. We\ndemonstrate how soft actuation creates a salient haptic signal while still\nallowing flexibility in device mounting. Using a psychophysics experiment, we\nshow that users can accurately distinguish inflation levels of the wrapped\ndisplay with an average Weber fraction of 11.4%. When we place the wrapped\ndisplay around the arm of a robotic manipulator, users are able to interpret\nand leverage the haptic signal in sample robot learning tasks, improving\nidentification of areas where the robot needs more training and enabling the\nuser to provide better demonstrations.

    "abstract": "In federated learning, each participant trains its local model with its own\ndata and a global model is formed at a trusted server by aggregating model\nupdates coming from these participants. Since the server has no effect and\nvisibility on the training procedure of the participants to ensure privacy, the\nglobal model becomes vulnerable to attacks such as data poisoning and model\npoisoning. Although many defense algorithms have recently been proposed to\naddress these attacks, they often make strong assumptions that do not agree\nwith the nature of federated learning, such as Non-IID datasets. Moreover, they\nmostly lack comprehensive experimental analyses. In this work, we propose a\ndefense algorithm called BARFED that does not make any assumptions about data\ndistribution, update similarity of participants, or the ratio of the malicious\nparticipants. BARFED mainly considers the outlier status of participant updates\nfor each layer of the model architecture based on the distance to the global\nmodel. Hence, the participants that do not have any outlier layer are involved\nin model aggregation. We perform extensive experiments on many grounds and show\nthat the proposed approach provides a robust defense against different attacks.",

    "abstract": "A widely used algorithm for transfer learning is fine-tuning, where a\npre-trained model is fine-tuned on a target task with a small amount of labeled\ndata. When the capacity of the pre-trained model is much larger than the size\nof the target data set, fine-tuning is prone to overfitting and \"memorizing\"\nthe training labels. Hence, an important question is to regularize fine-tuning\nand ensure its robustness to noise. To address this question, we begin by\nanalyzing the generalization properties of fine-tuning. We present a PAC-Bayes\ngeneralization bound that depends on the distance traveled in each layer during\nfine-tuning and the noise stability of the fine-tuned model. We empirically\nmeasure these quantities. Based on the analysis, we propose regularized\nself-labeling -- the interpolation between regularization and self-labeling\nmethods, including (i) layer-wise regularization to constrain the distance\ntraveled in each layer; (ii) self label-correction and label-reweighting to\ncorrect mislabeled data points (that the model is confident) and reweight less\nconfident data points. We validate our approach on an extensive collection of\nimage and text data sets using multiple pre-trained model architectures. Our\napproach improves baseline methods by 1.76% (on average) for seven image\nclassification tasks and 0.75% for a few-shot classification task. When the\ntarget data set includes noisy labels, our approach outperforms baseline\nmethods by 3.56% on average in two noisy settings.",

In particular, we\nemploy an analysis in which the rate-distortion function of the model\nparameters bounds the required mutual information between the training samples\nand the model parameters in order to learn a model up to a Bayes risk\nconstraint. For realizable models, we show that both the rate distortion\nfunction and mutual information admit expressions that are convenient for\nanalysis. For models that are (roughly) lower Lipschitz in their parameters, we\nbound the rate distortion function from below, whereas for VC classes, the\nmutual information is bounded above by $d_\\mathrm{vc}\\log(n)$. When these\nconditions match, the Bayes risk with respect to the zero-one loss scales no\nfaster than $\\Omega(d_\\mathrm{vc}/n)$, which matches known outer bounds and\nminimax lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.

In this paper, a novel method is proposed to efficiently\ncalculate the responses and accompanying design sensitivities in such\nmulti-partition problems using static condensation for use in gradient-based\ntopology optimization.

One\nof the major threats to the DNN privacy is model extraction attacks where\nadversaries attempt to steal sensitive information in DNN models. Recent\nstudies show hardware-based side channel attacks can reveal internal knowledge\nabout DNN models (e.g., model architectures) However, to date, existing attacks\ncannot extract detailed model parameters (e.g., weights/biases). In this work,\nfor the first time, we propose an advanced model extraction attack framework\nDeepSteal that effectively steals DNN weights with the aid of memory\nside-channel attack. Our proposed DeepSteal comprises two key stages. Firstly,\nwe develop a new weight bit information extraction method, called HammerLeak,\nthrough adopting the rowhammer based hardware fault technique as the\ninformation leakage vector. HammerLeak leverages several novel system-level\ntechniques tailed for DNN applications to enable fast and efficient weight\nstealing. Secondly, we propose a novel substitute model training algorithm with\nMean Clustering weight penalty, which leverages the partial leaked bit\ninformation effectively and generates a substitute prototype of the target\nvictim model. We evaluate this substitute model extraction method on three\npopular image datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10/100/GTSRB) and four DNN architectures\n(e.g., ResNet-18/34/Wide-ResNet/VGG-11). The extracted substitute model has\nsuccessfully achieved more than 90 % test accuracy on deep residual networks\nfor the CIFAR-10 dataset.

    "abstract": "Complex Event Recognition (CER) systems are a prominent technology for\nfinding user-defined query patterns over large data streams in real time. CER\nquery evaluation is known to be computationally challenging, since it requires\nmaintaining a set of partial matches, and this set quickly grows super-linearly\nin the number of processed events. We present CORE, a novel COmplex event\nRecognition Engine that focuses on the efficient evaluation of a large class of\ncomplex event queries, including time windows as well as the partition-by event\ncorrelation operator. This engine uses a novel evaluation algorithm that\ncircumvents the super-linear partial match problem: under data complexity, it\ntakes constant time per input event to maintain a data structure that compactly\nrepresents the set of partial matches and, once a match is found, the query\nresults may be enumerated from the data structure with output-linear delay. We\nexperimentally compare CORE against three state-of-the-art CER systems on both\nsynthetic and real-world data. We show that (1) CORE's performance is not\naffected by the length of the stream, size of the query, or size of the time\nwindow, and (2) CORE outperforms the other systems by up to three orders of\nmagnitude on different query workloads.",

    "title": "Improving the Utility of Locally Differentially Private Protocols for  Longitudinal and Multidimensional Frequency Estimates",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of collecting multidimensional data\nthroughout time (i.e., longitudinal studies) for the fundamental task of\nfrequency estimation under local differential privacy (LDP). Contrary to\nfrequency estimation of a single attribute (the majority of the works), the\nmultidimensional aspect imposes to pay particular attention to the privacy\nbudget. Besides, when collecting user statistics longitudinally, privacy\nprogressively degrades. Indeed, both \"multiple\" settings combined (i.e., many\nattributes and several collections throughout time) imposes several challenges,\nin which this paper proposes the first solution for frequency estimates under\nLDP. To tackle these issues, we extend the analysis of three state-of-the-art\nLDP protocols (Generalized Randomized Response -- GRR, Optimized Unary Encoding\n-- OUE, and Symmetric Unary Encoding -- SUE) for both longitudinal and\nmultidimensional data collections. While the known literature uses OUE and SUE\nfor two rounds of sanitization (a.k.a. memoization), i.e., L-OUE and L-SUE,\nrespectively, we analytically and experimentally show that starting with OUE\nand then with SUE provides higher data utility (i.e., L-OSUE). Also, for\nattributes with small domain sizes, we propose longitudinal GRR (L-GRR), which\nprovides higher utility than the other protocols based on unary encoding.\nLastly, we also propose a new solution named \\underline{A}daptive\n\\underline{L}DP for \\underline{LO}ngitudinal and \\underline{M}ultidimensional\n\\underline{FRE}quency \\underline{E}stimates (ALLOMFREE), which randomly samples\na single attribute to send with the whole privacy budget and adaptively selects\nthe optimal protocol, i.e., either L-GRR or L-OSUE. As shown in the results,\nALLOMFREE consistently and considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art L-SUE\nand L-OUE protocols in the quality of the frequency estimations.",

Finally, we\npresent a design study investigating the respective impact of the front and\nrear EM size on lap time, revealing that the rear motor sizing is predominant\ndue to the higher vertical rear tyre load caused by the center of pressure\nposition and rearwards load transfer under acceleration.",

This assumption doesn't generally hold true in a natural setting.\nUsually, the deployment data is subject to various types of distributional\nshifts. The magnitude of a model's performance is proportional to this shift in\nthe distribution of the dataset. Thus it becomes necessary to evaluate a\nmodel's uncertainty and robustness to distributional shifts to get a realistic\nestimate of its expected performance on real-world data. Present methods to\nevaluate uncertainty and model's robustness are lacking and often fail to paint\nthe full picture. Moreover, most analysis so far has primarily focused on\nclassification tasks.

    "abstract": "Abstract Simulation platforms facilitate the development of emerging\ncyber-physical systems (CPS) like self-driving cars (SDC) because they are more\nefficient and less dangerous than field operational tests. Despite this,\nthoroughly testing SDCs in simulated environments remains challenging because\nSDCs must be tested in a sheer amount of long-running test scenarios. Past\nresults on software testing optimization have shown that not all the tests\ncontribute equally to establishing confidence in test subjects' quality and\nreliability, with some \\uninformative\" tests that can be skipped (or removed)\nto reduce testing effort. However, this problem was partially addressed in the\ncontext of SDC simulation platforms. In this paper, we investigate test\nselection strategies to increase the cost-effectiveness of simulation-based\ntesting in the context of SDCs. We propose an approach called SDC-Scissor (SDC\ncoSt-effeCtIve teSt SelectOR), which leverages machine learning (ML) strategies\nto identify and skip tests that are unlikely to detect faults in SDCs before\nexecuting them. Specifically, SDC-Scissor extract features concerning the\ncharacteristics of the test scenarios being executed in the simulation\nenvironment and via ML strategies predict tests that lead to faults before\nexecuting them. Our evaluation shows that SDC-Scissor achieved high\nclassification accuracy (up to 93.4%) in classifying tests leading to a fault\nwhich allows improving testing cost-effectiveness: SDC-Scissor was able to\nreduce (ca. 170%) the time spent in running irrelevant tests as well as\nidentified 33% more failure triggering tests compared to a randomized baseline.\nInterestingly, SDC-Scissor does not introduce significant computational\noverhead in the SDCs testing process, which is critical to SDC development in\nindustrial settings.",

In this paper, we introduce\nnew algorithms that a) explore in a data-adaptive manner, and b) provide model\nselection guarantees of the form $\\mathcal{O}(d^{\\alpha} T^{1- \\alpha})$ with\nno feature diversity conditions whatsoever, where $d$ denotes the dimension of\nthe linear model and $T$ denotes the total number of rounds. The first\nalgorithm enjoys a \"best-of-both-worlds\" property, recovering two prior results\nthat hold under distinct distributional assumptions, simultaneously. The second\nremoves distributional assumptions altogether, expanding the scope for\ntractable model selection. Our approach extends to model selection among nested\nlinear contextual bandits under some additional assumptions.",

    "abstract": "We present a careful comparison of two model-free control algorithms,\nEvolution Strategies (ES) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), with receding\nhorizon model predictive control (MPC) for operating simulated, price\nresponsive water heaters. Four MPC variants are considered: a one-shot\ncontroller with perfect forecasting yielding optimal control; a limited-horizon\ncontroller with perfect forecasting; a mean forecasting-based controller; and a\ntwo-stage stochastic programming controller using historical scenarios. In all\ncases, the MPC model for water temperature and electricity price are exact;\nonly water demand is uncertain. For comparison, both ES and PPO learn neural\nnetwork-based policies by directly interacting with the simulated environment\nunder the same scenarios used by MPC. All methods are then evaluated on a\nseparate one-week continuation of the demand time series. We demonstrate that\noptimal control for this problem is challenging, requiring more than 8-hour\nlookahead for MPC with perfect forecasting to attain the minimum cost. Despite\nthis challenge, both ES and PPO learn good general purpose policies that\noutperform mean forecast and two-stage stochastic MPC controllers in terms of\naverage cost and are more than two orders of magnitude faster at computing\nactions. We show that ES in particular can leverage parallelism to learn a\npolicy in under 90 seconds using 1150 CPU cores.",

Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn policies from a given\ndataset without interacting with the environment.

We still lack studies on how dataset\ncharacteristics influence different Offline RL algorithms. Therefore, we\nconducted a comprehensive empirical analysis of how dataset characteristics\neffect the performance of Offline RL algorithms for discrete action\nenvironments. A dataset is characterized by two metrics: (1) the average\ndataset return measured by the Trajectory Quality (TQ) and (2) the coverage\nmeasured by the State-Action Coverage (SACo). We found that variants of the\noff-policy Deep Q-Network family require datasets with high SACo to perform\nwell.

A possible strategy is the use of gamification, that is i.e.\ntransforming the annotation task into a game. We propose an approach to gamify\nthe task of annotating lung fluid cells from pathological whole slide images.\nAs this domain is unknown to non-expert annotators, we transform images of\ncells detected with a RetinaNet architecture to the domain of flower images.\nThis domain transfer is performed with a CycleGAN architecture for different\ncell types.

We\nexperimentally validate the idea by building and testing a 5.5 kV dc generator\nmodule solely powered by a 20 kHz pulsed laser, and cascading three of those\nmodules to obtain 14.7 kV dc output voltage. We then discuss possible\nimprovements to the circuit design to make it useful for real-world\napplications. Finally, we demonstrate an optically powered electroadhesion\ngripper to show the practicality of the proposed high voltage generator.",

    "abstract": "Aerial images provide important situational awareness for responding to\nnatural disasters such as hurricanes. They are well-suited for providing\ninformation for damage estimation and localization (DEL); i.e., characterizing\nthe type and spatial extent of damage following a disaster. Despite recent\nadvances in sensing and unmanned aerial systems technology, much of\npost-disaster aerial imagery is still taken by handheld DSLR cameras from\nsmall, manned, fixed-wing aircraft. However, these handheld cameras lack IMU\ninformation, and images are taken opportunistically post-event by operators. As\nsuch, DEL from such imagery is still a highly manual and time-consuming\nprocess. We propose an approach to both detect damage in aerial images and\nlocalize it in world coordinates, with specific focus on detecting and\nlocalizing flooding. The approach is based on using structure from motion to\nrelate image coordinates to world coordinates via a projective transformation,\nusing class activation mapping to detect the extent of damage in an image, and\napplying the projective transformation to localize damage in world coordinates.\nWe evaluate the performance of our approach on post-event data from the 2016\nLouisiana floods, and find that our approach achieves a precision of 88%. Given\nthis high precision using limited data, we argue that this approach is\ncurrently viable for fast and effective DEL from handheld aerial imagery for\ndisaster response.",

If image quality is inadequate either patients have to return\nfor an additional scan, or a suboptimal interpretation is rendered.

Furthermore, radiologists' image\nquality requirements vary with the scan type and diagnostic task. Therefore,\nthe same score may have different implications for different scans.

Labels calibrated by human inputs follow a\nwell-defined and efficient labeling task. Image rulers address varying quality\nstandards and provide a concrete way of interpreting raw scores from the CNN.\nThe model supports assessments of two of the most common artifacts in MRI:\nnoise and motion.

First, endoscopic images\nwith the annotation about UC (positive or negative) are usually limited.\nSecond, they show a large variability in their appearance due to the location\nin the colon. Especially, the second difficulty prevents us from using existing\nsemi-supervised learning techniques, which are the common remedy for the first\ndifficulty. In this paper, we propose a practical semi-supervised learning\nmethod for UC classification by newly exploiting two additional features, the\nlocation in a colon (e.g., left colon) and image capturing order, both of which\nare often attached to individual images in endoscopic image sequences. The\nproposed method can extract the essential information of UC classification\nefficiently by a disentanglement process with those features.

Firstly, we\npropose the use of a learnable vector called Class token to replace the average\nglobal pooling mechanism to extract the embeddings. Unlike global average\npooling, our proposal takes into account the temporal structure of the input\nwhat is relevant for the text-dependent SV task. The class token is\nconcatenated to the input before the first MSA layer, and its state at the\noutput is used to predict the classes. To gain additional robustness, we\nintroduce two approaches. First, we have developed a Bayesian estimation of the\nclass token. Second, we have added a distilled representation token for\ntraining a teacher-student pair of networks using the Knowledge Distillation\n(KD) philosophy, which is combined with the class token. This distillation\ntoken is trained to mimic the predictions from the teacher network, while the\nclass token replicates the true label. All the strategies have been tested on\nthe RSR2015-Part II and DeepMine-Part 1 databases for text-dependent SV,\nproviding competitive results compared to the same architecture using the\naverage pooling mechanism to extract average embeddings.",

During training, DNS methods are typically\ntrained with mean squared error (MSE) type loss functions, which do not\nguarantee good perceptual quality. Perceptual evaluation of speech quality\n(PESQ) is a widely used metric for evaluating speech quality. However, the\noriginal PESQ algorithm is non-differentiable, and therefore cannot directly be\nused as optimization criterion for gradient-based learning. In this work, we\npropose an end-to-end non-intrusive PESQNet DNN to estimate the PESQ scores of\nthe enhanced speech signal. Thus, by providing a reference-free perceptual\nloss, it serves as a mediator towards the DNS training, allowing to maximize\nthe PESQ score of the enhanced speech signal. We illustrate the potential of\nour proposed PESQNet-mediated training on the basis of an already strong\nbaseline DNS. As further novelty, we propose to train the DNS and the PESQNet\nalternatingly to keep the PESQNet up-to-date and perform well specifically for\nthe DNS under training. Our proposed method is compared to the same DNS trained\nwith MSE-based loss for joint denoising and dereverberation, and the\nInterspeech 2021 DNS Challenge baseline. Detailed analysis shows that the\nPESQNet mediation can further increase the DNS performance by about 0.1 PESQ\npoints on synthetic test data and by 0.03 DNSMOS points on real test data,\ncompared to training with the MSE-based loss.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely studied in the portfolio\nmanagement task. However, it is challenging to understand a DRL-based trading\nstrategy because of the black-box nature of deep neural networks. In this\npaper, we propose an empirical approach to explain the strategies of DRL agents\nfor the portfolio management task. First, we use a linear model in hindsight as\nthe reference model, which finds the best portfolio weights by assuming knowing\nactual stock returns in foresight. In particular, we use the coefficients of a\nlinear model in hindsight as the reference feature weights. Secondly, for DRL\nagents, we use integrated gradients to define the feature weights, which are\nthe coefficients between reward and features under a linear regression model.\nThirdly, we study the prediction power in two cases, single-step prediction and\nmulti-step prediction. In particular, we quantify the prediction power by\ncalculating the linear correlations between the feature weights of a DRL agent\nand the reference feature weights, and similarly for machine learning methods.\nFinally, we evaluate a portfolio management task on Dow Jones 30 constituent\nstocks during 01/01/2009 to 09/01/2021. Our approach empirically reveals that a\nDRL agent exhibits a stronger multi-step prediction power than machine learning\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To assess whether the three-dimensional (3D) structural\nconfiguration of the central retinal vessel trunk and its branches (CRVT&B)\ncould be used as a diagnostic marker for glaucoma. Method: We trained a deep\nlearning network to automatically segment the CRVT&B from the B-scans of the\noptical coherence tomography (OCT) volume of the optic nerve head (ONH).\nSubsequently, two different approaches were used for glaucoma diagnosis using\nthe structural configuration of the CRVT&B as extracted from the OCT volumes.\nIn the first approach, we aimed to provide a diagnosis using only 3D CNN and\nthe 3D structure of the CRVT&B. For the second approach, we projected the 3D\nstructure of the CRVT&B orthographically onto three planes to obtain 2D images,\nand then a 2D CNN was used for diagnosis. The segmentation accuracy was\nevaluated using the Dice coefficient, whereas the diagnostic accuracy was\nassessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves\n(AUC). The diagnostic performance of the CRVT&B was also compared with that of\nretinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. Results: Our segmentation network\nwas able to efficiently segment retinal blood vessels from OCT scans. On a test\nset, we achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.81\\pm0.07. The 3D and 2D diagnostic\nnetworks were able to differentiate glaucoma from non-glaucoma subjects with\naccuracies of 82.7% and 83.3%, respectively. The corresponding AUCs for CRVT&B\nwere 0.89 and 0.90, higher than those obtained with RNFL thickness alone.\nConclusions: Our work demonstrated that the diagnostic power of the CRVT&B is\nsuperior to that of a gold-standard glaucoma parameter, i.e., RNFL thickness.\nOur work also suggested that the major retinal blood vessels form a skeleton --\nthe configuration of which may be representative of major ONH structural\nchanges as typically observed with the development and progression of glaucoma.",

Recently, Chen,\nthe first, second and fourth authors \\cite[Chen et al, 2021]{cfgw} attribute it\nto the operator corresponding to fractional multiplier, but it is only limited\nto 1-dimensional case. This paper naturally considers the high-dimensional\nsituation. We introduce the fractional Riesz transform associated with\nfractional Fourier transform, in which the chirp function is the key factor and\nthe technical barriers to be overcome. Furthermore, after equipping with chirp\nfunctions, we introduce and investigate the boundedness of singular integral\noperators, the dual properties of Hardy spaces and BMO spaces as well as the\napplications of theory of fractional multiplier in partial differential\nequation, which completely matched some classical results. Through numerical\nsimulation, we give the physical and geometric interpretation of the\nhigh-dimensional fractional multiplier theorem. Finally, we present the\napplication of the fractional Riesz transform in edge detection, which verifies\nthe prediction proposed in \\cite[Xu et al, 2016]{xxwqwy}.

In\nrecent years, multi-modal cues, including spatial information, facial\nexpression and voiceprint, are introduced to speaker extraction task to serve\nas complementary information to each other to achieve better performance.\nHowever, the front-end model, for speaker extraction, become large and hard to\ndeploy on a resource-constrained device. In this paper, we address the\naforementioned problem with novel model architectures and model compression\ntechniques, and propose a lightweight multi-modal framework for speaker\nextraction (dubbed LiMuSE), which adopts group communication (GC) to split\nmulti-modal high-dimension features into groups of low-dimension features with\nsmaller width which could be run in parallel, and further uses an ultra-low bit\nquantization strategy to achieve lower model size. The experiments on the GRID\ndataset show that incorporating GC into the multi-modal framework achieves on\npar or better performance with 24.86 times fewer parameters, and applying the\nquantization strategy to the GC-equipped model further obtains about 9 times\ncompression ratio while maintaining a comparable performance compared with\nbaselines.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent progress in light field super-resolution (LFSR) achieved\nby convolutional neural networks, the correlation information of light field\n(LF) images has not been sufficiently studied and exploited due to the\ncomplexity of 4D LF data. To cope with such high-dimensional LF data, most of\nthe existing LFSR methods resorted to decomposing it into lower dimensions and\nsubsequently performing optimization on the decomposed sub-spaces. However,\nthese methods are inherently limited as they neglected the characteristics of\nthe decomposition operations and only utilized a limited set of LF sub-spaces\nending up failing to comprehensively extract spatio-angular features and\nleading to a performance bottleneck. To overcome these limitations, in this\npaper, we thoroughly discover the potentials of LF decomposition and propose a\nnovel concept of decomposition kernels. In particular, we systematically unify\nthe decomposition operations of various sub-spaces into a series of such\ndecomposition kernels, which are incorporated into our proposed Decomposition\nKernel Network (DKNet) for comprehensive spatio-angular feature extraction. The\nproposed DKNet is experimentally verified to achieve substantial improvements\nby 1.35 dB, 0.83 dB, and 1.80 dB PSNR in 2x, 3x and 4x LFSR scales,\nrespectively, when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. To further\nimprove DKNet in producing more visually pleasing LFSR results, based on the\nVGG network, we propose a LFVGG loss to guide the Texture-Enhanced DKNet\n(TE-DKNet) to generate rich authentic textures and enhance LF images' visual\nquality significantly. We also propose an indirect evaluation metric by taking\nadvantage of LF material recognition to objectively assess the perceptual\nenhancement brought by the LFVGG loss.",

    "abstract": "Current treatment planning of patients diagnosed with brain tumor could\nsignificantly benefit by accessing the spatial distribution of tumor cell\nconcentration. Existing diagnostic modalities, such as magnetic-resonance\nimaging (MRI), contrast sufficiently well areas of high cell density. However,\nthey do not portray areas of low concentration, which can often serve as a\nsource for the secondary appearance of the tumor after treatment. Numerical\nsimulations of tumor growth could complement imaging information by providing\nestimates of full spatial distributions of tumor cells. Over recent years a\ncorpus of literature on medical image-based tumor modeling was published. It\nincludes different mathematical formalisms describing the forward tumor growth\nmodel. Alongside, various parametric inference schemes were developed to\nperform an efficient tumor model personalization, i.e. solving the inverse\nproblem. However, the unifying drawback of all existing approaches is the time\ncomplexity of the model personalization that prohibits a potential integration\nof the modeling into clinical settings. In this work, we introduce a\nmethodology for inferring patient-specific spatial distribution of brain tumor\nfrom T1Gd and FLAIR MRI medical scans. Coined as \\textit{Learn-Morph-Infer} the\nmethod achieves real-time performance in the order of minutes on widely\navailable hardware and the compute time is stable across tumor models of\ndifferent complexity, such as reaction-diffusion and\nreaction-advection-diffusion models.

Using Floridi's notion of how to design the 'infosphere' as a\nstarting point, in this chapter I consider the question: what are the limits of\ndesign, i.e. what are the conceptual constraints on designing AI for social\ngood? The main argument of this chapter is that while design is a useful\nconceptual tool to shape technologies and societies, collective efforts towards\ndesigning future societies are constrained by both internal and external\nfactors. Internal constraints on design are discussed by evoking Hardin's\nthought experiment regarding 'the Tragedy of the Commons'. Further, Hayek's\nclassical distinction between 'cosmos' and 'taxis' is used to demarcate\nexternal constraints on design. Finally, five design principles are presented\nwhich are aimed at helping policymakers manage the internal and external\nconstraints on design. A successful approach to designing future societies\nneeds to account for the emergent properties of complex systems by allowing\nspace for serendipity and socio-technological coevolution.",

Quite recently, the Taniguchi family of APN\nfunctions was shown to contain an exponential number of inequivalent APN\nfunctions by Kaspers and Zhou (J.

    "abstract": "Variational quantum circuits are used in quantum machine learning and\nvariational quantum simulation tasks. Designing good variational circuits or\npredicting how well they perform for given learning or optimization tasks is\nstill unclear. Here we discuss these problems, analyzing variational quantum\ncircuits using the theory of neural tangent kernels. We define quantum neural\ntangent kernels, and derive dynamical equations for their associated loss\nfunction in optimization and learning tasks. We analytically solve the dynamics\nin the frozen limit, or lazy training regime, where variational angles change\nslowly and a linear perturbation is good enough. We extend the analysis to a\ndynamical setting, including quadratic corrections in the variational angles.\nWe then consider hybrid quantum-classical architecture and define a large width\nlimit for hybrid kernels, showing that a hybrid quantum-classical neural\nnetwork can be approximately Gaussian. The results presented here show limits\nfor which analytical understandings of the training dynamics for variational\nquantum circuits, used for quantum machine learning and optimization problems,\nare possible. These analytical results are supported by numerical simulations\nof quantum machine learning experiments.",

    "abstract": "Speech enhancement in multichannel settings has been realized by utilizing\nthe spatial information embedded in multiple microphone signals. Moreover, deep\nneural networks (DNNs) have been recently advanced in this field; however,\nstudies on the efficient multichannel network structure fully exploiting\nspatial information and inter-channel relationships is still in its early\nstages. In this study, we propose an end-to-end time-domain speech enhancement\nnetwork that can facilitate the use of inter-channel relationships at\nindividual layers of a DNN. The proposed technique is based on a fully\nconvolutional time-domain audio separation network (Conv-TasNet), originally\ndeveloped for speech separation tasks. We extend Conv-TasNet into several forms\nthat can handle multichannel input signals and learn inter-channel\nrelationships. To this end, we modify the encoder-mask-decoder structures of\nthe network to be compatible with 3-D tensors defined over spatial channels,\nfeatures, and time dimensions. In particular, we conduct extensive parameter\nanalyses on the convolution structure and propose independent assignment of the\ndepthwise and 1$\\times$1 convolution layers to the feature and spatial\ndimensions, respectively. We demonstrate that the enriched inter-channel\ninformation from the proposed network plays a significant role in suppressing\nnoisy signals impinging from various directions. The proposed inter-channel\nConv-TasNet outperforms the state-of-the-art multichannel variants of neural\nnetworks, even with one-tenth of their parameter size. The performance of the\nproposed model is evaluated using the CHiME-3 dataset, which exhibits a\nremarkable improvement in SDR, PESQ, and STOI.",

    "abstract": "Video deraining is an important issue for outdoor vision systems and has been\ninvestigated extensively. However, designing optimal architectures by the\naggregating model formation and data distribution is a challenging task for\nvideo deraining. In this paper, we develop a model-guided triple-level\noptimization framework to deduce network architecture with cooperating\noptimization and auto-searching mechanism, named Triple-level Model Inferred\nCooperating Searching (TMICS), for dealing with various video rain\ncircumstances. In particular, to mitigate the problem that existing methods\ncannot cover various rain streaks distribution, we first design a\nhyper-parameter optimization model about task variable and hyper-parameter.\nBased on the proposed optimization model, we design a collaborative structure\nfor video deraining. This structure includes Dominant Network Architecture\n(DNA) and Companionate Network Architecture (CNA) that is cooperated by\nintroducing an Attention-based Averaging Scheme (AAS). To better explore\ninter-frame information from videos, we introduce a macroscopic structure\nsearching scheme that searches from Optical Flow Module (OFM) and Temporal\nGrouping Module (TGM) to help restore latent frame. In addition, we apply the\ndifferentiable neural architecture searching from a compact candidate set of\ntask-specific operations to discover desirable rain streaks removal\narchitectures automatically. Extensive experiments on various datasets\ndemonstrate that our model shows significant improvements in fidelity and\ntemporal consistency over the state-of-the-art works.

As an alternative, we may hire special players, whose only\nduty is to watch the population and punish defectors. Such a policelike or\nmercenary punishment can be maintained by a tax-based fund. If this tax is\nnegligible, a cyclic dominance may emerge among different strategies. When this\ntax is relevant then this solution disappears.

    "abstract": "We consider human activity recognition (HAR) from wearable sensor data in\nmanual-work processes, like warehouse order-picking. Such structured domains\ncan often be partitioned into distinct process steps, e.g., packaging or\ntransporting. Each process step can have a different prior distribution over\nactivity classes, e.g., standing or walking, and different system dynamics.\nHere, we show how such context information can be integrated systematically\ninto a deep neural network-based HAR system. Specifically, we propose a hybrid\narchitecture that combines a deep neural network-that estimates high-level\nmovement descriptors, attributes, from the raw-sensor data-and a shallow\nclassifier, which predicts activity classes from the estimated attributes and\n(optional) context information, like the currently executed process step. We\nempirically show that our proposed architecture increases HAR performance,\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we show that HAR\nperformance can be further increased when information about process steps is\nincorporated, even when that information is only partially correct.",

    "abstract": "Radio-Frequency (RF) based device-free Human Activity Recognition (HAR) rises\nas a promising solution for many applications. However, device-free (or\ncontactless) sensing is often more sensitive to environment changes than\ndevice-based (or wearable) sensing. Also, RF datasets strictly require on-line\nlabeling during collection, starkly different from image and text data\ncollections where human interpretations can be leveraged to perform off-line\nlabeling. Therefore, existing solutions to RF-HAR entail a laborious data\ncollection process for adapting to new environments. To this end, we propose\nRF-Net as a meta-learning based approach to one-shot RF-HAR; it reduces the\nlabeling efforts for environment adaptation to the minimum level. In\nparticular, we first examine three representative RF sensing techniques and two\nmajor meta-learning approaches. The results motivate us to innovate in two\ndesigns: i) a dual-path base HAR network, where both time and frequency domains\nare dedicated to learning powerful RF features including spatial and\nattention-based temporal ones, and ii) a metric-based meta-learning framework\nto enhance the fast adaption capability of the base network, including an\nRF-specific metric module along with a residual classification module. We\nconduct extensive experiments based on all three RF sensing techniques in\nmultiple real-world indoor environments; all results strongly demonstrate the\nefficacy of RF-Net compared with state-of-the-art baselines.",

Geoscientists\nface difficulties in setting the direction of the optimum method for\ndetermining petrophysical properties from rock images, Micro-Computed\nTomography (uCT), or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Most of the successful\nwork is from the homogeneous rocks focusing on 2D images with less focus on 3D\nand requiring numerical simulation. Currently, image analysis methods converge\nto three approaches: image processing, artificial intelligence, and combined\nimage processing with artificial intelligence. In this work, we propose two\nmethods to determine the porosity from 3D uCT and MRI images: an image\nprocessing method with Image Resolution Optimized Gaussian Algorithm (IROGA);\nadvanced image recognition method enabled by Machine Learning Difference of\nGaussian Random Forest (MLDGRF). We have built reference 3D micro models and\ncollected images for calibration of IROGA and MLDGRF methods. To evaluate the\npredictive capability of these calibrated approaches, we ran them on 3D uCT and\nMRI images of natural heterogeneous carbonate rock. We measured the porosity\nand lithology of the carbonate rock using three and two industry-standard ways,\nrespectively, as reference values.

In addition, binaural hearing also significantly\nimproves the ability to detect signals in noise. Humans can detect interaurally\nanti-phasic tones in masking noise at sound levels 15 dB below the detection\nthreshold of the equivalent in-phase tones. Intermediate thresholds result from\ndetecting tones in noise with an interaural time difference (ITD). The ITD\ndependence has been most accurately accounted for by models using an internal\ndelay-line mechanism. The delay lines, or an equivalent mechanism, however,\nhave not been found in mammals. Alternative coding principles that do not\ninclude delay lines can explain many aspects of sound localization but have\nfailed to account for some of the available data on binaural detection. By\nemploying the complex-valued correlation coefficient, we show that a minimum\nassumption model can explain the outcome of a wide range of binaural detection\nexperiments. The proposed mechanism requires fewer degrees of freedom when\ncompared to delay-line models while arguably improving compatibility with\nmammalian physiology.

Researchers\nhave demonstrated that it is possible to automatically detect the pharyngeal\nphase of swallowing and to localize the bolus in VFSS recordings via computer\nvision approaches, fostering the development of novel techniques for automatic\nVFSS analysis. However, training of algorithms to perform these tasks requires\nlarge amounts of annotated data that are seldom available. We demonstrate that\nthe challenges of pharyngeal phase detection and bolus localization can be\nsolved together using a single approach. We propose a deep-learning framework\nthat jointly tackles pharyngeal phase detection and bolus localization in a\nweakly-supervised manner, requiring only the initial and final frames of the\npharyngeal phase as ground truth annotations for the training.
