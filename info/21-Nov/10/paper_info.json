    "abstract": "In this paper we investigate a variety of deep learning strategies for\nsolving inverse problems. We classify existing deep learning solutions for\ninverse problems into three categories of Direct Mapping, Data Consistency\nOptimizer, and Deep Regularizer. We choose a sample of each inverse problem\ntype, so as to compare the robustness of the three categories, and report a\nstatistical analysis of their differences. We perform extensive experiments on\nthe classic problem of linear regression and three well-known inverse problems\nin computer vision, namely image denoising, 3D human face inverse rendering,\nand object tracking, selected as representative prototypes for each class of\ninverse problems. The overall results and the statistical analyses show that\nthe solution categories have a robustness behaviour dependent on the type of\ninverse problem domain, and specifically dependent on whether or not the\nproblem includes measurement outliers. Based on our experimental results, we\nconclude by proposing the most robust solution category for each inverse\nproblem class.",

    "abstract": "An architecture consisting of a serial coupling of the one-dimensional\nconvolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM)\nnetwork, which is referred as CNNsLSTM, was proposed for hourly-scale\nrainfall-runoff modeling in this study. In CNNsLTSM, the CNN component receives\nthe hourly meteorological time series data for a long duration, and then the\nLSTM component receives the extracted features from 1D-CNN and the hourly\nmeteorological time series data for a short-duration. As a case study, CNNsLSTM\nwas implemented for hourly rainfall-runoff modeling at the Ishikari River\nwatershed, Japan. The meteorological dataset, consists of precipitation, air\ntemperature, evapotranspiration, and long- and short-wave radiation, were\nutilized as input, and the river flow was used as the target data. To evaluate\nthe performance of proposed CNNsLSTM, results of CNNsLSTM were compared with\nthose of 1D-CNN, LSTM only with hourly inputs (LSTMwHour), parallel\narchitecture of 1D-CNN and LSTM (CNNpLSTM), and the LSTM architecture which\nuses both daily and hourly input data (LSTMwDpH). CNNsLSTM showed clear\nimprovements on the estimation accuracy compared to the three conventional\narchitectures (1D-CNN, LSTMwHour, and CNNpLSTM), and recently proposed\nLSTMwDpH. In comparison to observed flows, the median of the NSE values for the\ntest period are 0.455-0.469 for 1D-CNN (based on NCHF=8, 16, and 32, the\nnumbers of the channels of the feature map of the first layer of CNN),\n0.639-0.656 for CNNpLSTM (based on NCHF=8, 16, and 32), 0.745 for LSTMwHour,\n0.831 for LSTMwDpH, and 0.865-0.873 for CNNsLSTM (based on NCHF=8, 16, and 32).\nFurthermore, the proposed CNNsLSTM reduces the median RMSE of 1D-CNN by\n50.2%-51.4%, CNNpLSTM by 37.4%-40.8%, LSTMwHour by 27.3%-29.5%, and LSTMwDpH by\n10.6%-13.4%.",

    "abstract": "Using multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is necessary for accurate\nbrain tumor segmentation. The main problem is that not all types of MRIs are\nalways available in clinical exams. Based on the fact that there is a strong\ncorrelation between MR modalities of the same patient, in this work, we propose\na novel brain tumor segmentation network in the case of missing one or more\nmodalities. The proposed network consists of three sub-networks: a\nfeature-enhanced generator, a correlation constraint block and a segmentation\nnetwork. The feature-enhanced generator utilizes the available modalities to\ngenerate 3D feature-enhanced image representing the missing modality. The\ncorrelation constraint block can exploit the multi-source correlation between\nthe modalities and also constrain the generator to synthesize a\nfeature-enhanced modality which must have a coherent correlation with the\navailable modalities. The segmentation network is a multi-encoder based U-Net\nto achieve the final brain tumor segmentation. The proposed method is evaluated\non BraTS 2018 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed method which achieves the average Dice Score of 82.9, 74.9 and\n59.1 on whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively across all\nthe situations, and outperforms the best method by 3.5%, 17% and 18.2%.",

With variants ranging from classical settings\nlike PAC learning and regression to recent trends such as adversarially robust\nand private learning, it's surprising that we still lack a unified theory;\ntraditional proofs of the equivalence tend to be disparate, and rely on strong\nmodel-specific assumptions like uniform convergence and sample compression.\nIn this work, we give the first model-independent framework explaining the\nequivalence of realizable and agnostic learnability: a three-line blackbox\nreduction that simplifies, unifies, and extends our understanding across a wide\nvariety of settings. This includes models with no known characterization of\nlearnability such as learning with arbitrary distributional assumptions or\ngeneral loss, as well as a host of other popular settings such as robust\nlearning, partial learning, fair learning, and the statistical query model.\nMore generally, we argue that the equivalence of realizable and agnostic\nlearning is actually a special case of a broader phenomenon we call property\ngeneralization: any desirable property of a learning algorithm (e.g.\\ noise\ntolerance, privacy, stability) that can be satisfied over finite hypothesis\nclasses extends (possibly in some variation) to any learnable hypothesis class.",

As other regularizing approaches, it is based on the\nminimization of an incremental potential gathering energy and dissipation\ninformations. A staggered alternate minimization iterative process is then used\nto go from one time instant to the next. An originality of the Lip-field\napproach is that the damage update is performed in two steps. First, a purely\nlocal one and then a global one but in a small active zone that can be\npredicted a priori. This prediction is obtained by computing upper and lower\nbounds to the true global update field from the local update. The active zone\nis the set of points where the bounds differ. The damage update ensures damage\nirreversibility. Four numerical examples demonstrate the capability of the new\napproach.",

    "abstract": "Benefiting from expanding cloud infrastructure, deep neural networks (DNNs)\ntoday have increasingly high performance when trained in the cloud. Researchers\nspend months of effort competing for an extra few percentage points of model\naccuracy. However, when these models are actually deployed on edge devices in\npractice, very often, the performance can abruptly drop over 10% without\nobvious reasons. The key challenge is that there is not much visibility into ML\ninference execution on edge devices, and very little awareness of potential\nissues during the edge deployment process. We present ML-EXray, an end-to-end\nframework, which provides visibility into layer-level details of the ML\nexecution, and helps developers analyze and debug cloud-to-edge deployment\nissues. More often than not, the reason for sub-optimal edge performance does\nnot only lie in the model itself, but every operation throughout the data flow\nand the deployment process. Evaluations show that ML-EXray can effectively\ncatch deployment issues, such as pre-processing bugs, quantization issues,\nsuboptimal kernels, etc. Using ML-EXray, users need to write less than 15 lines\nof code to fully examine the edge deployment pipeline. Eradicating these\nissues, ML-EXray can correct model performance by up to 30%, pinpoint\nerror-prone layers, and guide users to optimize kernel execution latency by two\norders of magnitude.

    "title": "Planar Robot Casting with Real2Sim2Real Self-Supervised Learning",
    "abstract": "Manipulation of deformable objects using a single parameterized dynamic\naction can be useful for tasks such as fly fishing, lofting a blanket, and\nplaying shuffleboard. Such tasks take as input a desired final state and output\none parameterized open-loop dynamic robot action which produces a trajectory\ntoward the final state. This is especially challenging for long-horizon\ntrajectories with complex dynamics involving friction. This paper explores the\ntask of Planar Robot Casting (PRC): where one planar motion of a robot wrist\nholding one end of a cable causes the other end to slide across the plane\ntoward a desired target. PRC allows the cable to reach points beyond the\nrobot's workspace and has applications for cable management in homes,\nwarehouses, and factories. To efficiently learn a PRC policy for a given cable,\nwe propose Real2Sim2Real, a self-supervised framework that automatically\ncollects physical trajectory examples to tune parameters of a dynamics\nsimulator using Differential Evolution, generates many simulated examples, and\nthen learns a policy using a weighted combination of simulated and physical\ndata. We evaluate Real2Sim2Real with three simulators, Isaac Gym-segmented,\nIsaac Gym-hybrid, and PyBullet, two function approximators, Gaussian Processes\nand Neural Networks (NNs), and three cables with differing stiffness, torsion,\nand friction. Results on 16 held-out test targets for each cable suggest that\nthe NN PRC policies using Isaac Gym-segmented attain median error distance (as\n% of cable length) ranging from 8% to 14%, outperforming baselines and policies\ntrained on only real or only simulated examples.

Motivated by the need for dependence analysis of distributed software\nand the diverse cost-effectiveness needs of dependence-based applications, this\npaper presents D$^2$ABS, a framework of dynamic dependence abstraction for\ndistributed programs. By partial-ordering distributed method-execution events\nand inferring causality from the ordered events, D$^2$ABS abstracts\nmethod-level dependencies both within and across process boundaries. Further,\nby exploiting message-passing semantics across processes, and incorporating\nstatic dependencies and statement coverage within individual components, we\npresent three additional instantiations of D$^2$ABS that trade efficiency for\nbetter precision. We present the design of the D$^2$ABS framework and evaluate\nthe four instantiations of D$^2$ABS on distributed systems of various\narchitectures and scales using our implementation for Java. Our empirical\nresults show that D$^2$ABS is significantly more effective than existing\noptions while offering varied levels of cost-effectiveness tradeoffs.

The success of the traditional RL framework\ncrucially relies on the underlying agent-reward model, which, however, depends\non how accurately a system designer can express an appropriate reward function\nand often a non-trivial task. The main novelty of our framework is the ability\nto learn from preference-based trajectory feedback that eliminates the need to\nhand-craft numeric reward models. This paper sets up a formal framework for the\nPbRL problem with non-markovian rewards, where the trajectory preferences are\nencoded by a generalized linear model of dimension $d$. Assuming the transition\nmodel is known, we then propose an algorithm with almost optimal regret\nguarantee of $\\tilde {\\mathcal{O}}\\left( SH d \\log (T / \\delta) \\sqrt{T}\n\\right)$.

A planar soft limb, actuated by a pair\nof shape memory alloy (SMA) coils and containing embedded sensors for\ntemperature and angular deflection, is used as a test platform. Data from this\nrobot are used to train LSTM neural networks, using different combinations of\nsensor data, to model both unidirectional (one SMA) and bidirectional (both\nSMAs) motion. Open-loop rollout results show that the learned model is able to\npredict motions over extraordinarily long open-loop timescales (10 minutes)\nwith little drift. Prediction errors are on the order of the soft deflection\nsensor's accuracy, even when using only the actuator's pulse width modulation\ninputs for learning.

We investigate the feasibility of\nthis model-assisted framework on three different dynamical systems (Rossler\nattractor, FitzHugh--Nagumo model, and a turbulent fluid flow) and three\ndifferent deep neural network architectures (feedforward, long short-term\nmemory, and reservoir computing). In each case, we study the prediction\naccuracy, robustness to noise, reproducibility under repeated training, and\nsensitivity to the type of input data. In particular, we find long short-term\nmemory networks to be most robust to noise and to yield relatively accurate\npredictions, while requiring minimal fine-tuning of the hyperparameters.",

    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of Reinforcement Learning in safety-critical systems\ndomains such as autonomous vehicles, health, and aviation raises the need for\nensuring their safety. Existing safety mechanisms such as adversarial training,\nadversarial detection, and robust learning are not always adapted to all\ndisturbances in which the agent is deployed. Those disturbances include moving\nadversaries whose behavior can be unpredictable by the agent, and as a matter\nof fact harmful to its learning. Ensuring the safety of critical systems also\nrequires methods that give formal guarantees on the behaviour of the agent\nevolving in a perturbed environment. It is therefore necessary to propose new\nsolutions adapted to the learning challenges faced by the agent. In this paper,\nfirst we generate adversarial agents that exhibit flaws in the agent's policy\nby presenting moving adversaries. Secondly, We use reward shaping and a\nmodified Q-learning algorithm as defense mechanisms to improve the agent's\npolicy when facing adversarial perturbations. Finally, probabilistic model\nchecking is employed to evaluate the effectiveness of both mechanisms. We have\nconducted experiments on a discrete grid world with a single agent facing\nnon-learning and learning adversaries. Our results show a diminution in the\nnumber of collisions between the agent and the adversaries.

To harness the power offered by multi-GPU\nsystems, it is critical to eliminate bottlenecks in inter-GPU communication - a\nproblem made challenging by the heterogeneous nature of interconnects. In this\nwork, we present TACCL, a synthesizer for collective communication primitives\nfor large-scale multi-GPU systems. TACCL encodes a profiled topology and input\nsize into a synthesis problem to generate optimized communication algorithms.\nTACCL is built on top of the standard NVIDIA Collective Communication Library\n(NCCL), allowing it to be a drop-in replacement for GPU communication in\nframeworks like PyTorch with minimal changes. TACCL generates algorithms for\ncommunication primitives like Allgather, Alltoall, and Allreduce that are up to\n$3\\times$ faster than NCCL. Using TACCL's algorithms speeds up the end-to-end\ntraining of an internal mixture of experts model by $17\\%$. By decomposing the\noptimization problem into parts and leveraging the symmetry in multi-GPU\ntopologies, TACCL synthesizes collectives for up to 80-GPUs in less than 3\nminutes, at least two orders of magnitude faster than other synthesis-based\nstate-of-the-art collective communication libraries.",

The algorithms developed describe an extensive\ntoolkit of methods for circumventing the deleterious effects of noise in the\ncontext of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) framework.\nWe offer two primary contributions, both focused on noisy data acquired from a\nsystem x' = f(x). First, we propose, for use in high-noise settings, an\nextensive toolkit of critically enabling extensions for the SINDy regression\nmethod, to progressively cull functionals from an over-complete library and\nyield a set of sparse equations that regress to the derivate x'. These\ninnovations can extract sparse governing equations and coefficients from\nhigh-noise time-series data (e.g. 300% added noise). For example, it discovers\nthe correct sparse libraries in the Lorenz system, with median coefficient\nestimate errors equal to 1% - 3% (for 50% noise), 6% - 8% (for 100% noise); and\n23% - 25% (for 300% noise). The enabling modules in the toolkit are combined\ninto a single method, but the individual modules can be tactically applied in\nother equation discovery methods (SINDy or not) to improve results on\nhigh-noise data. Second, we propose a technique, applicable to any model\ndiscovery method based on x' = f(x), to assess the accuracy of a discovered\nmodel in the context of non-unique solutions due to noisy data. Currently, this\nnon-uniqueness can obscure a discovered model's accuracy and thus a discovery\nmethod's effectiveness. We describe a technique that uses linear dependencies\namong functionals to transform a discovered model into an equivalent form that\nis closest to the true model, enabling more accurate assessment of a discovered\nmodel's accuracy.",

    "abstract": "We study active sampling algorithms for linear regression, which aim to query\nonly a small number of entries of a target vector $b\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ and output\na near minimizer to $\\min_{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^d}\\|Ax-b\\|$, where $A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\n\\times d}$ is a design matrix and $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is some loss function.\nFor $\\ell_p$ norm regression for any $0<p<\\infty$, we give an algorithm based\non Lewis weight sampling that outputs a $(1+\\epsilon)$ approximate solution\nusing just $\\tilde{O}(d^{\\max(1,{p/2})}/\\mathrm{poly}(\\epsilon))$ queries to\n$b$. We show that this dependence on $d$ is optimal, up to logarithmic factors.\nOur result resolves a recent open question of Chen and Derezi\\'{n}ski, who gave\nnear optimal bounds for the $\\ell_1$ norm, and suboptimal bounds for $\\ell_p$\nregression with $p\\in(1,2)$.\nWe also provide the first total sensitivity upper bound of\n$O(d^{\\max\\{1,p/2\\}}\\log^2 n)$ for loss functions with at most degree $p$\npolynomial growth. This improves a recent result of Tukan, Maalouf, and\nFeldman. By combining this with our techniques for the $\\ell_p$ regression\nresult, we obtain an active regression algorithm making $\\tilde\nO(d^{1+\\max\\{1,p/2\\}}/\\mathrm{poly}(\\epsilon))$ queries, answering another open\nquestion of Chen and Derezi\\'{n}ski. For the important special case of the\nHuber loss, we further improve our bound to an active sample complexity of\n$\\tilde O(d^{(1+\\sqrt2)/2}/\\epsilon^c)$ and a non-active sample complexity of\n$\\tilde O(d^{4-2\\sqrt 2}/\\epsilon^c)$, improving a previous $d^4$ bound for\nHuber regression due to Clarkson and Woodruff. Our sensitivity bounds have\nfurther implications, improving a variety of previous results using sensitivity\nsampling, including Orlicz norm subspace embeddings and robust subspace\napproximation. Finally, our active sampling results give the first sublinear\ntime algorithms for Kronecker product regression under every $\\ell_p$ norm.",

The objectives we\nstudy include makespan, weighted completion time, and $L_q$ norm of machine\nloads. We develop nearly-linear time approximation algorithms for the studied\nproblems with $O(1)$-approximation ratios, many of which match the\ncorrespondent best known ratios achievable in polynomial time.\nOur main technique is linear programming relaxation. For problems in the\nunrelated machine setting, we formulate mixed packing and covering LP\nrelaxations of nearly-linear size, and solve them approximately using the\nnearly-linear time solver of Young. We show the LP solutions can be rounded\nwithin $O(1)$-factor loss. For problems in the identical machine with\nprecedence constraints setting, the precedence constraints can not be\nformulated as packing or covering constraints. To achieve the claimed running\ntime, we define a polytope for the constraints, and leverage the multiplicative\nweight update (MWU) method with an oracle which always returns solutions in the\npolytope.\nAlong the way of designing the oracle, we encounter the single-commodity\nmaximum flow problem over a directed acyclic graph $G = (V, E)$, where sources\nand sinks have limited supplies and demands, but edges have infinite\ncapacities.

There have been many studies focusing on distilling valuable\ninformation from structured data, such as disease codes, laboratory test\nresults, and treatments. However, relying on structured data only might be\ninsufficient in reflecting patients' comprehensive information and such data\nmay occasionally contain erroneous records. Objective: With the recent advances\nof machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, an increasing\nnumber of studies seek to obtain more accurate results by incorporating\nunstructured free-text data as well. This paper reviews studies that use\nmultimodal data, i.e. a combination of structured and unstructured data, from\nEHRs as input for conventional ML or DL models to address the targeted tasks.\nMaterials and Methods: We searched in the Institute of Electrical and\nElectronics Engineers (IEEE) Digital Library, PubMed, and Association for\nComputing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library for articles related to ML-based\nmultimodal EHR studies. Results and Discussion: With the final 94 included\nstudies, we focus on how data from different modalities were combined and\ninteracted using conventional ML and DL techniques, and how these algorithms\nwere applied in EHR-related tasks.

    "abstract": "Real-world data usually present long-tailed distributions.

The severe sparseness of training instances\nfor the tail classes is the main challenge, which results in biased\ndistribution estimation during training. Plenty of efforts have been devoted to\nameliorating the challenge, including data re-sampling and synthesizing new\ntraining instances for tail classes. However, no prior research has exploited\nthe transferable knowledge from head classes to tail classes for calibrating\nthe distribution of tail classes. In this paper, we suppose that tail classes\ncan be enriched by similar head classes and propose a novel distribution\ncalibration approach named as label-Aware Distribution Calibration LADC. LADC\ntransfers the statistics from relevant head classes to infer the distribution\nof tail classes. Sampling from calibrated distribution further facilitates\nre-balancing the classifier.

Hardware designers can use HDLs to\nmigrate hardware designs between devices and explore performance, area and\npower tradeoffs, as well as, port designs to an alternative device. However, if\ndesign files are corrupt or missing, the portability of the design is lost.\nWhile reverse engineering efforts may be able to recover an HDL-netlist of the\noriginal design, HDL-netlists use device-specific primitives, restricting\nportability.

    "abstract": "Recent success of generative adversarial networks (GAN) has made great\nprogress on the face animation task. However, the complex scene structure of a\nface image still makes it a challenge to generate videos with face poses\nsignificantly deviating from the source image. On one hand, without knowing the\nfacial geometric structure, generated face images might be improperly\ndistorted. On the other hand, some area of the generated image might be\noccluded in the source image, which makes it difficult for GAN to generate\nrealistic appearance. To address these problems, we propose a structure aware\nface animation (SAFA) method which constructs specific geometric structures to\nmodel different components of a face image. Following the well recognized\nmotion based face animation technique, we use a 3D morphable model (3DMM) to\nmodel the face, multiple affine transforms to model the other foreground\ncomponents like hair and beard, and an identity transform to model the\nbackground. The 3DMM geometric embedding not only helps generate realistic\nstructure for the driving scene, but also contributes to better perception of\noccluded area in the generated image. Besides, we further propose to exploit\nthe widely studied inpainting technique to faithfully recover the occluded\nimage area.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised dialogue structure learning is an important and meaningful task\nin natural language processing. The extracted dialogue structure and process\ncan help analyze human dialogue, and play a vital role in the design and\nevaluation of dialogue systems. The traditional dialogue system requires\nexperts to manually design the dialogue structure, which is very costly. But\nthrough unsupervised dialogue structure learning, dialogue structure can be\nautomatically obtained, reducing the cost of developers constructing dialogue\nprocess. The learned dialogue structure can be used to promote the dialogue\ngeneration of the downstream task system, and improve the logic and consistency\nof the dialogue robot's reply.In this paper, we propose a Bert-based\nunsupervised dialogue structure learning algorithm DSBERT (Dialogue Structure\nBERT). Different from the previous SOTA models VRNN and SVRNN, we combine BERT\nand AutoEncoder, which can effectively combine context information. In order to\nbetter prevent the model from falling into the local optimal solution and make\nthe dialogue state distribution more uniform and reasonable, we also propose\nthree balanced loss functions that can be used for dialogue structure learning.\nExperimental results show that DSBERT can generate a dialogue structure closer\nto the real structure, can distinguish sentences with different semantics and\nmap them to different hidden states.",

DeepDGL employs\nan encoder-decoder architecture, consisting of two encoders to learn global and\nlocal temporal patterns, respectively, and a decoder to make multi-step\nforecasting. Specifically, to model complicated global patterns, the vector\nquantization (VQ) module is introduced, allowing the global feature encoder to\nlearn a shared codebook among all time series. To model diversified and\nheterogenous local patterns, an adaptive parameter generation module enhanced\nby the contrastive multi-horizon coding (CMC) is proposed to generate the\nparameters of the local feature encoder for each individual time series, which\nmaximizes the mutual information between the series-specific context variable\nand the long/short-term representations of the corresponding time series.

    "abstract": "A 3D point cloud is typically constructed from depth measurements acquired by\nsensors at one or more viewpoints. The measurements suffer from both\nquantization and noise corruption. To improve quality, previous works denoise a\npoint cloud \\textit{a posteriori} after projecting the imperfect depth data\nonto 3D space. Instead, we enhance depth measurements directly on the sensed\nimages \\textit{a priori}, before synthesizing a 3D point cloud. By enhancing\nnear the physical sensing process, we tailor our optimization to our depth\nformation model before subsequent processing steps that obscure measurement\nerrors. Specifically, we model depth formation as a combined process of\nsignal-dependent noise addition and non-uniform log-based quantization. The\ndesigned model is validated (with parameters fitted) using collected empirical\ndata from an actual depth sensor. To enhance each pixel row in a depth image,\nwe first encode intra-view similarities between available row pixels as edge\nweights via feature graph learning. We next establish inter-view similarities\nwith another rectified depth image via viewpoint mapping and sparse linear\ninterpolation. This leads to a maximum a posteriori (MAP) graph filtering\nobjective that is convex and differentiable. We optimize the objective\nefficiently using accelerated gradient descent (AGD), where the optimal step\nsize is approximated via Gershgorin circle theorem (GCT).

Nowadays, hardware solutions based on\nemerging nanodevices are designed to reduce the power consumption of these\nnetworks. Spintronics devices are promising for information processing because\nof the various neural and synaptic functionalities they offer. However, due to\ntheir low OFF/ON ratio, performing all the multiplications required for\nconvolutions in a single step with a crossbar array of spintronic memories\nwould cause sneak-path currents. Here we present an architecture where synaptic\ncommunications have a frequency selectivity that prevents crosstalk caused by\nsneak-path currents. We first demonstrate how a chain of spintronic resonators\ncan function as synapses and make convolutions by sequentially rectifying\nradio-frequency signals encoding consecutive sets of inputs. We show that a\nparallel implementation is possible with multiple chains of spintronic\nresonators to avoid storing intermediate computational steps in memory. We\npropose two different spatial arrangements for these chains. For each of them,\nwe explain how to tune many artificial synapses simultaneously, exploiting the\nsynaptic weight sharing specific to convolutions. We show how information can\nbe transmitted between convolutional layers by using spintronic oscillators as\nartificial microwave neurons. Finally, we simulate a network of these\nradio-frequency resonators and spintronic oscillators to solve the MNIST\nhandwritten digits dataset, and obtain results comparable to software\nconvolutional neural networks.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is a promising learning paradigm for boosting the\nperformance and reliability of resource-efficient graph neural networks (GNNs)\nusing more expressive yet cumbersome teacher models. Past work on distillation\nfor GNNs proposed the Local Structure Preserving loss (LSP), which matches\nlocal structural relationships across the student and teacher's node embedding\nspaces. In this paper, we make two key contributions:\nFrom a methodological perspective, we study whether preserving the global\ntopology of how the teacher embeds graph data can be a more effective\ndistillation objective for GNNs, as real-world graphs often contain latent\ninteractions and noisy edges. The purely local LSP objective over pre-defined\nedges is unable to achieve this as it ignores relationships among disconnected\nnodes. We propose two new approaches which better preserve global topology: (1)\nGlobal Structure Preserving loss (GSP), which extends LSP to incorporate all\npairwise interactions; and (2) Graph Contrastive Representation Distillation\n(G-CRD), which uses contrastive learning to align the student node embeddings\nto those of the teacher in a shared representation space.\nFrom an experimental perspective, we introduce an expanded set of benchmarks\non large-scale real-world datasets where the performance gap between teacher\nand student GNNs is non-negligible. We believe this is critical for testing the\nefficacy and robustness of knowledge distillation, but was missing from the LSP\nstudy which used synthetic datasets with trivial performance gaps. Experiments\nacross 4 datasets and 14 heterogeneous GNN architectures show that G-CRD\nconsistently boosts the performance and robustness of lightweight GNN models,\noutperforming the structure preserving approaches, LSP and GSP, as well as\nbaselines adapted from 2D computer vision.",

Specifically, in the\nfirst stage, we use the full-duplex technique to estimate the channel between a\nBS's specific antenna and the RIS, addressing the critical scaling ambiguity\nproblem in the channel decomposition. We then design a novel deep neural\nnetwork, namely, the sparse-connected long short-term memory (SCLSTM), and\npropose a SCLSTM-based algorithm in the second and third stages, respectively.\nThe algorithm can simultaneously decompose the BS-RIS channel and RIS-UE\nchannel from the cascaded channel and capture the temporal relationship of the\nRIS-UE channel for prediction. Simulation results show that our proposed\nframework has lower pilot overhead than the traditional channel estimation\nalgorithms, and the proposed SCLSTM-based algorithm can also achieve more\naccurate CSI acquisition robustly and effectively.",

To tackle this problem, we propose a dual\nprototypical contrastive learning approach tailored to the FSS task to capture\nthe representative semanticfeatures effectively. The main idea is to encourage\nthe prototypes more discriminative by increasing inter-class distance while\nreducing intra-class distance in prototype feature space. To this end, we first\npresent a class-specific contrastive loss with a dynamic prototype dictionary\nthat stores the class-aware prototypes during training, thus enabling the same\nclass prototypes similar and the different class prototypes to be dissimilar.\nFurthermore, we introduce a class-agnostic contrastive loss to enhance the\ngeneralization ability to unseen classes by compressing the feature\ndistribution of semantic class within each episode. We demonstrate that the\nproposed dual prototypical contrastive learning approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art FSS methods on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets.

However, most of existing FL algorithms cannot guarantee the\nperformance fairness towards different clients or different groups of samples\nbecause of the distribution shift. Recent researches focus on achieving\nfairness among clients, but they ignore the fairness towards different groups\nformed by sensitive attribute(s) (e.g., gender and/or race), which is important\nand practical in real applications. To bridge this gap, we formulate the goal\nof unified group fairness on FL which is to learn a fair global model with\nsimilar performance on different groups. To achieve the unified group fairness\nfor arbitrary sensitive attribute(s), we propose a novel FL algorithm, named\nGroup Distributionally Robust Federated Averaging (G-DRFA), which mitigates the\ndistribution shift across groups with theoretical analysis of convergence rate.\nSpecifically, we treat the performance of the federated global model at each\ngroup as an objective and employ the distributionally robust techniques to\nmaximize the performance of the worst-performing group over an uncertainty set\nby group reweighting.

The theoretical efficiency of the RWS scheduler has been\nanalyzed for a variety of settings, but most of them are quite complicated.

We avoid using the potential function in\nthe analysis, and we assume a highly asynchronous setting, which is more\nrealistic for today's parallel machines.\nOur second and main contribution is some new parallel cache complexity for\nalgorithms using the RWS scheduler. Although the sequential I/O model has been\nwell-studied over the past decades, so far very few results have extended it to\nthe parallel setting. The parallel cache bounds of many existing algorithms are\naffected by a polynomial of the span, which causes a significant overhead for\nhigh-span algorithms.

    "abstract": "Sparse convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained significant traction\nover the past few years as sparse CNNs can drastically decrease the model size\nand computations, if exploited befittingly, as compared to their dense\ncounterparts. Sparse CNNs often introduce variations in the layer shapes and\nsizes, which can prevent dense accelerators from performing well on sparse CNN\nmodels. Recently proposed sparse accelerators like SCNN, Eyeriss v2, and\nSparTen, actively exploit the two-sided or full sparsity, that is, sparsity in\nboth weights and activations, for performance gains. These accelerators,\nhowever, either have inefficient micro-architecture, which limits their\nperformance, have no support for non-unit stride convolutions and\nfully-connected (FC) layers, or suffer massively from systematic load\nimbalance. To circumvent these issues and support both sparse and dense models,\nwe propose Phantom, a multi-threaded, dynamic, and flexible neural\ncomputational core. Phantom uses sparse binary mask representation to actively\nlookahead into sparse computations, and dynamically schedule its computational\nthreads to maximize the thread utilization and throughput. We also generate a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) mesh architecture of Phantom neural computational cores,\nwhich we refer to as Phantom-2D accelerator, and propose a novel dataflow that\nsupports all layers of a CNN, including unit and non-unit stride convolutions,\nand FC layers. In addition, Phantom-2D uses a two-level load balancing strategy\nto minimize the computational idling, thereby, further improving the hardware\nutilization. To show support for different types of layers, we evaluate the\nperformance of the Phantom architecture on VGG16 and MobileNet. Our simulations\nshow that the Phantom-2D accelerator attains a performance gain of 12x, 4.1x,\n1.98x, and 2.36x, over dense architectures, SCNN, SparTen, and Eyeriss v2,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Various mature automated test generation tools exist for statically typed\nprogramming languages such as Java. Automatically generating tests for\ndynamically typed programming languages such as Python, however, is\nsubstantially more difficult due to the dynamic nature of these languages as\nwell as the lack of type information. Our Pynguin framework provides automated\nunit test generation for Python. In this paper, we extend our previous work on\nPynguin to support more aspects of the Python language, and by studying a\nlarger variety of well-established state of the art test-generation algorithms,\nnamely DynaMOSA, MIO, and MOSA. Our experiments confirm that evolutionary\nalgorithms can outperform random test generation also in the context of Python,\nand similar to the Java world, MOSA and DynaMOSA yield the highest coverage\nresults. However, our results demonstrate that there are still fundamental\nissues, such as inferring type information for code without this information,\nfor test generation for Python to be solved.",

    "abstract": "A hybrid hydropower power plant is a conventional HydroPower Plant (HPP)\naugmented with a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to decrease the wear and\ntear of sensitive mechanical components and improve the reliability and\nregulation performance of the overall plant. A central task of controlling\nhybrid power plants is determining how the total power set-point should be\nsplit between the BESS and the hybridized unit (power set-point splitting) as a\nfunction of the operational objectives. This paper describes a Model Predictive\nControl (MPC) framework for hybrid medium- and high-head plants to determine\nthe power set-point of the hydropower unit and the BESS. The splitting policy\nrelies on an explicit formulation of the mechanical loads incurred by the HPP's\npenstock, which can be damaged due to fatigue when providing regulation\nservices to the grid. By filtering out from the HPP's power set-point the\ncomponents conducive to excess penstock fatigue and properly controlling the\nBESS, the proposed MPC is able to maintain the same level of regulation\nperformance while significantly decreasing damages to the hydraulic conduits. A\nproof-of-concept by simulations is provided considering a 230 MW medium-head\nhydropower plant.",

Kernelized bandit algorithms have shown strong empirical and\ntheoretical performance for this problem. They heavily rely on the assumption\nthat the model is well-specified, however, and can fail without it. Instead, we\nintroduce a \\emph{misspecified} kernelized bandit setting where the unknown\nfunction can be $\\epsilon$--uniformly approximated by a function with a bounded\nnorm in some Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We design efficient and\npractical algorithms whose performance degrades minimally in the presence of\nmodel misspecification. Specifically, we present two algorithms based on\nGaussian process (GP) methods: an optimistic EC-GP-UCB algorithm that requires\nknowing the misspecification error, and Phased GP Uncertainty Sampling, an\nelimination-type algorithm that can adapt to unknown model misspecification. We\nprovide upper bounds on their cumulative regret in terms of $\\epsilon$, the\ntime horizon, and the underlying kernel, and we show that our algorithm\nachieves optimal dependence on $\\epsilon$ with no prior knowledge of\nmisspecification. In addition, in a stochastic contextual setting, we show that\nEC-GP-UCB can be effectively combined with the regret bound balancing strategy\nand attain similar regret bounds despite not knowing $\\epsilon$.",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models applied to audio have improved by a large margin the\nstate-of-the-art in many speech and music related tasks. However, as raw\nwaveform modelling remains an inherently difficult task, audio generative\nmodels are either computationally intensive, rely on low sampling rates, are\ncomplicated to control or restrict the nature of possible signals. Among those\nmodels, Variational AutoEncoders (VAE) give control over the generation by\nexposing latent variables, although they usually suffer from low synthesis\nquality. In this paper, we introduce a Realtime Audio Variational autoEncoder\n(RAVE) allowing both fast and high-quality audio waveform synthesis. We\nintroduce a novel two-stage training procedure, namely representation learning\nand adversarial fine-tuning. We show that using a post-training analysis of the\nlatent space allows a direct control between the reconstruction fidelity and\nthe representation compactness. By leveraging a multi-band decomposition of the\nraw waveform, we show that our model is the first able to generate 48kHz audio\nsignals, while simultaneously running 20 times faster than real-time on a\nstandard laptop CPU. We evaluate synthesis quality using both quantitative and\nqualitative subjective experiments and show the superiority of our approach\ncompared to existing models.

We investigate learning representations that facilitate\ntransfer learning from one compositional task to another: the representation\nand the task-specific layers of the models are strategically trained\ndifferently on a pre-finetuning task such that they generalize well on\nmismatched splits that require compositionality. We apply this method to\nsemantic parsing, using three very different datasets, COGS, GeoQuery and SCAN,\nused alternately as the pre-finetuning and target task.

    "abstract": "The most fundamental problem considered in algorithms for text processing is\npattern matching: given a pattern $p$ of length $m$ and a text $t$ of length\n$n$, does $p$ occur in $t$? Multiple versions of this basic question have been\nconsidered, and by now we know algorithms that are fast both in practice and in\ntheory. However, the rapid increase in the amount of generated and stored data\nbrings the need of designing algorithms that operate directly on compressed\nrepresentations of data. In the compressed pattern matching problem we are\ngiven a compressed representation of the text, with $n$ being the length of the\ncompressed representation and $N$ being the length of the text, and an\nuncompressed pattern of length $m$. The most challenging (and yet relevant when\nworking with highly repetitive data, say biological information) scenario is\nwhen the chosen compression method is capable of describing a string of\nexponential length (in the size of its representation). An elegant formalism\nfor such a compression method is that of straight-line programs, which are\nsimply context-free grammars describing exactly one string. While it has been\nknown that compressed pattern matching problem can be solved in $O(m+n\\log N)$\ntime for this compression method, designing a linear-time algorithm remained\nopen. We resolve this open question by presenting an $O(n+m)$ time algorithm\nthat, given a context-free grammar of size $n$ that produces a single string\n$t$ and a pattern $p$ of length $m$, decides whether $p$ occurs in $t$ as a\nsubstring.

This is especially important for focused crawlers because\nthey strive to provide a comprehensive analysis of specific parts of the Web,\nthus prioritizing discovery of new pages over discovery of changes in content.\nIn the literature, changes in hyperlinks and content have been usually\nconsidered simultaneously. However, there is also evidence suggesting that\nthese two types of changes are not necessarily related. Moreover, many studies\nabout predicting changes assume that long history of a page is available, which\nis unattainable in practice. The aim of this work is to provide a methodology\nfor detecting new links effectively using a short history. To this end, we use\na dataset of ten crawls at intervals of one week. Our study consists of three\nparts. First, we obtain insight in the data by analyzing empirical properties\nof the number of new outlinks. We observe that these properties are, on\naverage, stable over time, but there is a large difference between emergence of\nhyperlinks towards pages within and outside the domain of a target page\n(internal and external outlinks, respectively). Next, we provide statistical\nmodels for three targets: the link change rate, the presence of new links, and\nthe number of new links. These models include the features used earlier in the\nliterature, as well as new features introduced in this work. We analyze\ncorrelation between the features, and investigate their informativeness. A\nnotable finding is that, if the history of the target page is not available,\nthen our new features, that represent the history of related pages, are most\npredictive for new links in the target page. Finally, we propose ranking\nmethods as guidelines for focused crawlers to efficiently discover new pages,\nwhich achieve excellent performance with respect to the corresponding targets.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have demonstrated that deep neural networks are easily\nmisled by adversarial examples. Effectively evaluating the adversarial\nrobustness of a model is important for its deployment in practical\napplications. Currently, a common type of evaluation is to approximate the\nadversarial risk of a model as a robustness indicator by constructing malicious\ninstances and executing attacks. Unfortunately, there is an error (gap) between\nthe approximate value and the true value. Previous studies manually design\nattack methods to achieve a smaller error, which is inefficient and may miss a\nbetter solution. In this paper, we establish the tightening of the\napproximation error as an optimization problem and try to solve it with an\nalgorithm. More specifically, we first analyze that replacing the non-convex\nand discontinuous 0-1 loss with a surrogate loss, a necessary compromise in\ncalculating the approximation, is one of the main reasons for the error. Then\nwe propose AutoLoss-AR, the first method for searching loss functions for\ntightening the approximation error of adversarial risk. Extensive experiments\nare conducted in multiple settings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed method: the best-discovered loss functions outperform the\nhandcrafted baseline by 0.9%-2.9% and 0.7%-2.0% on MNIST and CIFAR-10,\nrespectively. Besides, we also verify that the searched losses can be\ntransferred to other settings and explore why they are better than the baseline\nby visualizing the local loss landscape.",

    "title": "Neural News Recommendation with Event Extraction",
    "abstract": "A key challenge of online news recommendation is to help users find articles\nthey are interested in. Traditional news recommendation methods usually use\nsingle news information, which is insufficient to encode news and user\nrepresentation. Recent research uses multiple channel news information, e.g.,\ntitle, category, and body, to enhance news and user representation. However,\nthese methods only use various attention mechanisms to fuse multi-view\nembeddings without considering deep digging higher-level information contained\nin the context. These methods encode news content on the word level and jointly\ntrain the attention parameters in the recommendation network, leading to more\ncorpora being required to train the model. We propose an Event Extraction-based\nNews Recommendation (EENR) framework to overcome these shortcomings, utilizing\nevent extraction to abstract higher-level information. EENR also uses a\ntwo-stage strategy to reduce parameters in subsequent parts of the\nrecommendation network. We train the Event Extraction module by external\ncorpora in the first stage and apply the trained model to the news\nrecommendation dataset to predict event-level information, including event\ntypes, roles, and arguments, in the second stage. Then we fuse multiple channel\ninformation, including event information, news title, and category, to encode\nnews and users. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show that our\nEENR method can effectively improve the performance of news recommendations.\nFinally, we also explore the reasonability of utilizing higher abstract level\ninformation to substitute news body content.",

    "title": "Almost Optimal Universal Lower Bound for Learning Causal DAGs with  Atomic Interventions",
    "abstract": "A well-studied challenge that arises in the structure learning problem of\ncausal directed acyclic graphs (DAG) is that using observational data, one can\nonly learn the graph up to a \"Markov equivalence class\" (MEC). The remaining\nundirected edges have to be oriented using interventions, which can be very\nexpensive to perform in applications. Thus, the problem of minimizing the\nnumber of interventions needed to fully orient the MEC has received a lot of\nrecent attention, and is also the focus of this work. We prove two main\nresults. The first is a new universal lower bound on the number of atomic\ninterventions that any algorithm (whether active or passive) would need to\nperform in order to orient a given MEC. Our second result shows that this bound\nis, in fact, within a factor of two of the size of the smallest set of atomic\ninterventions that can orient the MEC. Our lower bound is provably better than\npreviously known lower bounds. The proof of our lower bound is based on the new\nnotion of CBSP orderings, which are topological orderings of DAGs without\nv-structures and satisfy certain special properties. Further, using simulations\non synthetic graphs and by giving examples of special graph families, we show\nthat our bound is often significantly better.",

    "abstract": "The proposed European Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) is the first attempt\nto elaborate a general legal framework for AI carried out by any major global\neconomy. As such, the AIA is likely to become a point of reference in the\nlarger discourse on how AI systems can (and should) be regulated. In this\narticle, we describe and discuss the two primary enforcement mechanisms\nproposed in the AIA: the conformity assessments that providers of high-risk AI\nsystems are expected to conduct, and the post-market monitoring plans that\nproviders must establish to document the performance of high-risk AI systems\nthroughout their lifetimes. We argue that AIA can be interpreted as a proposal\nto establish a Europe-wide ecosystem for conducting AI auditing, albeit in\nother words. Our analysis offers two main contributions. First, by describing\nthe enforcement mechanisms included in the AIA in terminology borrowed from\nexisting literature on AI auditing, we help providers of AI systems understand\nhow they can prove adherence to the requirements set out in the AIA in\npractice. Second, by examining the AIA from an auditing perspective, we seek to\nprovide transferable lessons from previous research about how to refine further\nthe regulatory approach outlined in the AIA. We conclude by highlighting seven\naspects of the AIA where amendments (or simply clarifications) would be\nhelpful. These include, above all, the need to translate vague concepts into\nverifiable criteria and to strengthen the institutional safeguards concerning\nconformity assessments based on internal checks.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarially crafted, small and\nimperceptible changes in the natural inputs. The most effective defense\nmechanism against these examples is adversarial training which constructs\nadversarial examples during training by iterative maximization of loss. The\nmodel is then trained to minimize the loss on these constructed examples. This\nmin-max optimization requires more data, larger capacity models, and additional\ncomputing resources. It also degrades the standard generalization performance\nof a model. Can we achieve robustness more efficiently? In this work, we\nexplore this question from the perspective of knowledge transfer. First, we\ntheoretically show the transferability of robustness from an adversarially\ntrained teacher model to a student model with the help of mixup augmentation.\nSecond, we propose a novel robustness transfer method called Mixup-Based\nActivated Channel Maps (MixACM) Transfer. MixACM transfers robustness from a\nrobust teacher to a student by matching activated channel maps generated\nwithout expensive adversarial perturbations. Finally, extensive experiments on\nmultiple datasets and different learning scenarios show our method can transfer\nrobustness while also improving generalization on natural images.",

    "title": "A Statistical Difference Reduction Method for Escaping Backdoor  Detection",
    "abstract": "Recent studies show that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to\nbackdoor attacks. An infected model behaves normally on benign inputs, whereas\nits prediction will be forced to an attack-specific target on adversarial data.\nSeveral detection methods have been developed to distinguish inputs to defend\nagainst such attacks. The common hypothesis that these defenses rely on is that\nthere are large statistical differences between the latent representations of\nclean and adversarial inputs extracted by the infected model. However, although\nit is important, comprehensive research on whether the hypothesis must be true\nis lacking. In this paper, we focus on it and study the following relevant\nquestions: 1) What are the properties of the statistical differences? 2) How to\neffectively reduce them without harming the attack intensity? 3) What impact\ndoes this reduction have on difference-based defenses? Our work is carried out\non the three questions. First, by introducing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy\n(MMD) as the metric, we identify that the statistical differences of\nmulti-level representations are all large, not just the highest level. Then, we\npropose a Statistical Difference Reduction Method (SDRM) by adding a\nmulti-level MMD constraint to the loss function during training a backdoor\nmodel to effectively reduce the differences. Last, three typical\ndifference-based detection methods are examined. The F1 scores of these\ndefenses drop from 90%-100% on the regularly trained backdoor models to 60%-70%\non the models trained with SDRM on all two datasets, four model architectures,\nand four attack methods. The results indicate that the proposed method can be\nused to enhance existing attacks to escape backdoor detection algorithms.",

    "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Disinformation Detection: Stance, Sentiment, or  Something Else?",
    "abstract": "Both politics and pandemics have recently provided ample motivation for the\ndevelopment of machine learning-enabled disinformation (a.k.a. fake news)\ndetection algorithms. Existing literature has focused primarily on the\nfully-automated case, but the resulting techniques cannot reliably detect\ndisinformation on the varied topics, sources, and time scales required for\nmilitary applications. By leveraging an already-available analyst as a\nhuman-in-the-loop, however, the canonical machine learning techniques of\nsentiment analysis, aspect-based sentiment analysis, and stance detection\nbecome plausible methods to use for a partially-automated disinformation\ndetection system. This paper aims to determine which of these techniques is\nbest suited for this purpose and how each technique might best be used towards\nthis end. Training datasets of the same size and nearly identical neural\narchitectures (a BERT transformer as a word embedder with a single feed-forward\nlayer thereafter) are used for each approach, which are then tested on\nsentiment- and stance-specific datasets to establish a baseline of how well\neach method can be used to do the other tasks. Four different datasets relating\nto COVID-19 disinformation are used to test the ability of each technique to\ndetect disinformation on a topic that did not appear in the training data set.\nQuantitative and qualitative results from these tests are then used to provide\ninsight into how best to employ these techniques in practice.",

We identify six distinct types of smartphone users by conducting\nlatent class analyses that classify individuals based on their frequency of\nsmartphone use, self-rated smartphone skills, and activities carried out on\ntheir smartphone. The results show that the smartphone usage types differ\nsignificantly by sociodemographic and smartphone-related characteristics: The\ntypes reflecting more frequent and diverse smartphone use are younger, have\nhigher levels of educational attainment, and are more likely to use an iPhone.\nOverall, the composition of the latent classes and their characteristics are\nrobust across samples and time.",

    "abstract": "Scientific workflow management systems like Nextflow support large-scale data\nanalysis by abstracting away the details of scientific workflows. In these\nsystems, workflows consist of several abstract tasks, of which instances are\nrun in parallel and transform input partitions into output partitions. Resource\nmanagers like Kubernetes execute such workflow tasks on cluster\ninfrastructures. However, these resource managers only consider the number of\nCPUs and the amount of available memory when assigning tasks to resources; they\ndo not consider hardware differences beyond these numbers, while computational\nspeed and memory access rates can differ significantly.\nWe propose Tarema, a system for allocating task instances to heterogeneous\ncluster resources during the execution of scalable scientific workflows. First,\nTarema profiles the available infrastructure with a set of benchmark programs\nand groups cluster nodes with similar performance. Second, Tarema uses online\nmonitoring data of tasks, assigning labels to tasks depending on their resource\nusage. Third, Tarema uses the node groups and task labels to dynamically assign\ntask instances evenly to resources based on resource demand. Our evaluation of\na prototype implementation for Kubernetes, using five real-world Nextflow\nworkflows from the popular nf-core framework and two 15-node clusters\nconsisting of different virtual machines, shows a mean reduction of isolated\njob runtimes by 19.8% compared to popular schedulers in widely-used resource\nmanagers and 4.54% compared to the heuristic SJFN, while providing a better\ncluster usage. Moreover, executing two long-running workflows in parallel and\non restricted resources shows that Tarema is able to reduce the runtimes even\nmore while providing a fair cluster usage.",

And many supervised reID methods employed local-level\nfeatures and achieved significant performance improvements. However, applying\nlocal-level features to unsupervised methods may introduce an unstable\nperformance. To improve the performance stability for unsupervised video reID,\nthis paper introduces a general scheme fusing part models and unsupervised\nlearning. In this scheme, the global-level feature is divided into equal\nlocal-level feature. A local-aware module is employed to explore the poentials\nof local-level feature for unsupervised learning.

    "abstract": "The computational capabilities of recent mobile devices enable the processing\nof natural features for Augmented Reality (AR), but the scalability is still\nlimited by the devices' computation power and available resources. In this\npaper, we propose EdgeXAR, a mobile AR framework that utilizes the advantages\nof edge computing through task offloading to support flexible camera-based AR\ninteraction. We propose a hybrid tracking system for mobile devices that\nprovides lightweight tracking with 6 Degrees of Freedom and hides the\noffloading latency from users' perception. A practical, reliable and unreliable\ncommunication mechanism is used to achieve fast response and consistency of\ncrucial information. We also propose a multi-object image retrieval pipeline\nthat executes fast and accurate image recognition tasks on the cloud and edge\nservers. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of\nEdgeXAR by building mobile AR Apps upon it. Regarding the Quality of Experience\n(QoE), the mobile AR Apps powered by EdgeXAR framework run on average at the\nspeed of 30 frames per second with precise tracking of only 1~2 pixel errors\nand accurate image recognition of at least 97% accuracy. As compared to\nVuforia, one of the leading commercial AR frameworks, EdgeXAR transmits 87%\nless data while providing a stable 30 FPS performance and reducing the\noffloading latency by 50 to 70% depending on the transmission medium.

    "abstract": "We consider a multi-link diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) system\nwhere multiple spatially distributed transmitter (TX)-receiver (RX) pairs\nestablish point-to-point communication links employing the same type of\nsignaling molecules. To exploit the full potential of such a system, an\nin-depth understanding of the interplay between the spatial user density and\ninter-user interference (IUI) and its impact on the system performance is\nneeded. In this paper, we consider a three-dimensional unbounded domain with\nmultiple spatially distributed point-to-point non-cooperative transmission\nlinks, where both the TXs and RXs are positioned on a regular fixed grid. For\nthis setup, we first derive an analytical expression for the channel impulse\nresponses between all TXs and RXs. Then, we derive the maximum likelihood (ML)\ndetector for the RXs and show that it reduces to a threshold-based detector.\nMoreover, we derive an analytical expression for the corresponding detection\nthreshold which depends on the statistics of the desired signal, the statistics\nof the MC channel, and the statistics of the IUI. Furthermore, we derive an\nanalytical expression for the bit error rate and the achievable rate of a\nsingle transmission link. Finally, we propose a new performance metric, which\nwe refer to as area rate efficiency (ARE), that captures the tradeoff between\nthe transmission link density and the IUI. The ARE characterizes how\nefficiently the available TX and RX areas are used for information transmission\nand is expressed in bits per unit area. We show that there exists an optimal\ntransmission link density for maximizing the ARE. The presented results reveal\nthat the optimal link density depends on the number of molecules used for\nmodulation and the value of the diffusion coefficient, while the impact of the\nchosen grid structure and the concentration of background noise molecules is\nnegligible.",

As an example, we focus on the so-called\nConditional Value at Risk (CVaR), but the approach is equally applicable to\nother coherent risk measures. Both the full and reduced space formulations are\nconsidered. The algorithm is based on low rank tensor approximations of random\nfields discretized using stochastic collocation. To avoid non-smoothness of the\nobjective function underpinning the CVaR, we propose an adaptive strategy to\nselect the width parameter of the smoothed CVaR to balance the smoothing and\ntensor approximation errors. Moreover, unbiased Monte Carlo CVaR estimate can\nbe computed by using the smoothed CVaR as a control variate. To accelerate the\ncomputations, we introduce an efficient preconditioner for the KKT system in\nthe full space formulation.The numerical experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed method enables accurate CVaR optimization constrained by large-scale\ndiscretized systems. In particular, the first example consists of an elliptic\nPDE with random coefficients as constraints. The second example is motivated by\na realistic application to devise a lockdown plan for United Kingdom under\nCOVID-19.

The layers of a DNN can be mapped onto different nodes located\nin the cloud, edge and shop floor for preserving privacy. The quality of the\ndata that is fed into and processed through the DNN is of utmost importance for\ncritical tasks, such as inspection and quality control. Distributed Data\nValidation Networks (DDVNs) are used to validate the quality of the data.\nHowever, they are prone to single points of failure when an attack occurs. This\npaper proposes QUDOS, an approach that enhances the security of a distributed\nDNN that is supported by DDVNs using quorums. The proposed approach allows\nindividual nodes that are corrupted due to an attack to be detected or excluded\nwhen the DNN produces an output. Metrics such as corruption factor and success\nprobability of an attack are considered for evaluating the security aspects of\nDNNs. A simulation study demonstrates that if the number of corrupted nodes is\nless than a given threshold for decision-making in a quorum, the QUDOS approach\nalways prevents attacks. Furthermore, the study shows that increasing the size\nof the quorum has a better impact on security than increasing the number of\nlayers.

We classify these approaches into four categories: (1) compact\nnetworks, (2) energy-efficient training strategies, (3) energy-efficient\ninference approaches, and (4) efficient data usage. For each category, we\ndiscuss the progress that has been achieved and the unresolved challenges.",

In general rectangle stabbing problem, also known as\nhorizontal-vertical stabbing problem (HV-Stabbing), the goal is to find a set\nof rectilinear (i.e., either vertical or horizontal) line segments of minimum\ntotal length such that all rectangles are stabbed. Both variants are NP-hard.\nChan, van Dijk, Fleszar, Spoerhase, and Wolff [2018]initiated the study of\nthese problems by providing constant approximation algorithms. Recently,\nEisenbrand, Gallato, Svensson, and Venzin [2021] have presented a QPTAS and a\npolynomial-time 8-approximation algorithm for STABBING but it is was open\nwhether the problem admits a PTAS.\nIn this paper, we obtain a PTAS for STABBING, settling this question. For\nHV-Stabbing, we obtain a $(2+\\varepsilon)$-approximation. We also obtain PTASes\nfor special cases of HV-Stabbing: (i) when all rectangles are squares, (ii)\nwhen each rectangle's width is at most its height, and (iii) when all\nrectangles are $\\delta$-large, i.e., have at least one edge whose length is at\nleast $\\delta$, while all edge lengths are at most 1. Our result also implies\nimproved approximations for other problems such as generalized minimum\nManhattan network.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive studies on motion stabilization of bipeds, they still\nsuffer from the lack of disturbance coping capability on slippery surfaces. In\nthis paper, a novel controller for stabilizing a bipedal motion in its sagittal\nplane is developed with regard to the surface friction limitations. By taking\ninto account the physical limitation of the surface in the stabilization trend,\na more advanced level of reliability is achieved that provides higher\nfunctionalities such as push recovery on low-friction surfaces and prevents the\nstabilizer from overreacting. The discrete event-based strategy consists of\nmodifying the step length and time period at the beginning of each footstep in\norder to reestablish stability necessary conditions while taking into account\nthe surface friction limitation as a constraint to prevent slippage. Adjusting\nfootsteps to prevent slippage in confronting external disturbances is perceived\nas a novel strategy for keeping stability, quite similar to human reaction. The\ndeveloped methodology consists of rough closed-form solutions utilizing\nelementary math operations for obtaining the control inputs, allowing to reach\na balance between convergence and computational cost, which is quite suitable\nfor real-time operations even with modest computational hardware. Several\nnumerical simulations, including push recovery and switching between different\ngates on low-friction surfaces, are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed controller.

In\naddition, we introduced a smooth temporal basis, i.e. the B-spline temporal\nbasis of order $d$, whereas $d=1$ was used together with the OBIE in a previous\nstudy [Takahashi 2014]. Corresponding to these new techniques, we generalised\nthe interpolation-based fast multipole method that was developed in\n\\cite{takahashi2014}.

Equivalently, it is a linear rewrite\nrule on Boolean terms that constitutes a valid implication. Linear inferences\nhave played a significant role in structural proof theory, in particular in\nmodels of substructural logics and in normalisation arguments for deep\ninference proof systems.\nSystems of linear logic and, later, deep inference are founded upon two\nparticular linear inferences, switch : $x \\land (y \\lor z) \\to (x \\land y) \\lor\nz$, and medial : $(w \\land x) \\lor (y \\land z) \\to (w \\lor y) \\land (x \\lor\nz)$. It is well-known that these two are not enough to derive all linear\ninferences (even modulo all valid linear equations), but beyond this little\nmore is known about the structure of linear inferences in general. In\nparticular despite recurring attention in the literature, the smallest linear\ninference not derivable under switch and medial (`switch-medial-independent')\nwas not previously known.\nIn this work we leverage recently developed graphical representations of\nlinear formulae to build an implementation that is capable of more efficiently\nsearching for switch-medial-independent inferences. We use it to find four\n`minimal' 8-variable independent inferences and also prove that no smaller ones\nexist; in contrast, a previous approach based directly on formulae reached\ncomputational limits already at 7 variables. Two of these new inferences derive\nsome previously found independent linear inferences.

    "abstract": "Multimodal analysis has recently drawn much interest in affective computing,\nsince it can improve the overall accuracy of emotion recognition over isolated\nuni-modal approaches. The most effective techniques for multimodal emotion\nrecognition efficiently leverage diverse and complimentary sources of\ninformation, such as facial, vocal, and physiological modalities, to provide\ncomprehensive feature representations. In this paper, we focus on dimensional\nemotion recognition based on the fusion of facial and vocal modalities\nextracted from videos, where complex spatiotemporal relationships may be\ncaptured. Most of the existing fusion techniques rely on recurrent networks or\nconventional attention mechanisms that do not effectively leverage the\ncomplimentary nature of audio-visual (A-V) modalities. We introduce a\ncross-attentional fusion approach to extract the salient features across A-V\nmodalities, allowing for accurate prediction of continuous values of valence\nand arousal. Our new cross-attentional A-V fusion model efficiently leverages\nthe inter-modal relationships. In particular, it computes cross-attention\nweights to focus on the more contributive features across individual\nmodalities, and thereby combine contributive feature representations, which are\nthen fed to fully connected layers for the prediction of valence and arousal.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated experimentally on\nvideos from the RECOLA and Fatigue (private) data-sets. Results indicate that\nour cross-attentional A-V fusion model is a cost-effective approach that\noutperforms state-of-the-art fusion approaches.

The\nstate-of-the-art copresence detection schemes suffer from two major\nlimitations: (1) they cannot accurately detect copresence in low-entropy\ncontext (e.g., empty room with few events occurring) and insufficiently\nseparated environments (e.g., adjacent rooms), (2) they require devices to have\ncommon sensors (e.g., microphones) to capture context, making them impractical\non devices with heterogeneous sensors. We address these limitations, proposing\nNext2You, a novel copresence detection scheme utilizing channel state\ninformation (CSI). In particular, we leverage magnitude and phase values from a\nrange of subcarriers specifying a Wi-Fi channel to capture a robust wireless\ncontext created when devices communicate. We implement Next2You on\noff-the-shelf smartphones relying only on ubiquitous Wi-Fi chipsets and\nevaluate it based on over 95 hours of CSI measurements that we collect in five\nreal-world scenarios. Next2You achieves error rates below 4%, maintaining\naccurate copresence detection both in low-entropy context and insufficiently\nseparated environments. We also demonstrate the capability of Next2You to work\nreliably in real-time and its robustness to various attacks.",

    "title": "MLHarness: A Scalable Benchmarking System for MLCommons",
    "abstract": "With the society's growing adoption of machine learning (ML) and deep\nlearning (DL) for various intelligent solutions, it becomes increasingly\nimperative to standardize a common set of measures for ML/DL models with large\nscale open datasets under common development practices and resources so that\npeople can benchmark and compare models quality and performance on a common\nground. MLCommons has emerged recently as a driving force from both industry\nand academia to orchestrate such an effort. Despite its wide adoption as\nstandardized benchmarks, MLCommons Inference has only included a limited number\nof ML/DL models (in fact seven models in total). This significantly limits the\ngenerality of MLCommons Inference's benchmarking results because there are many\nmore novel ML/DL models from the research community, solving a wide range of\nproblems with different inputs and outputs modalities. To address such a\nlimitation, we propose MLHarness, a scalable benchmarking harness system for\nMLCommons Inference with three distinctive features: (1) it codifies the\nstandard benchmark process as defined by MLCommons Inference including the\nmodels, datasets, DL frameworks, and software and hardware systems; (2) it\nprovides an easy and declarative approach for model developers to contribute\ntheir models and datasets to MLCommons Inference; and (3) it includes the\nsupport of a wide range of models with varying inputs/outputs modalities so\nthat we can scalably benchmark these models across different datasets,\nframeworks, and hardware systems. This harness system is developed on top of\nthe MLModelScope system, and will be open sourced to the community. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate the superior flexibility and scalability of\nthis harness system for MLCommons Inference benchmarking.",

    "abstract": "Pairwise learning is receiving increasing attention since it covers many\nimportant machine learning tasks, e.g., metric learning, AUC maximization, and\nranking. Investigating the generalization behavior of pairwise learning is thus\nof significance. However, existing generalization analysis mainly focuses on\nthe convex objective functions, leaving the nonconvex learning far less\nexplored. Moreover, the current learning rates derived for generalization\nperformance of pairwise learning are mostly of slower order. Motivated by these\nproblems, we study the generalization performance of nonconvex pairwise\nlearning and provide improved learning rates. Specifically, we develop\ndifferent uniform convergence of gradients for pairwise learning under\ndifferent assumptions, based on which we analyze empirical risk minimizer,\ngradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent pairwise learning. We first\nsuccessfully establish learning rates for these algorithms in a general\nnonconvex setting, where the analysis sheds insights on the trade-off between\noptimization and generalization and the role of early-stopping. We then\ninvestigate the generalization performance of nonconvex learning with a\ngradient dominance curvature condition. In this setting, we derive faster\nlearning rates of order $\\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, where $n$ is the sample size.\nProvided that the optimal population risk is small, we further improve the\nlearning rates to $\\mathcal{O}(1/n^2)$, which, to the best of our knowledge,\nare the first $\\mathcal{O}(1/n^2)$-type of rates for pairwise learning, no\nmatter of convex or nonconvex learning.

TRACE\nis an efficient privacy-preserving ride-hailing service proposed by Wang et al.\nin 2018. TRACE uses masking along with other cryptographic techniques to ensure\nefficient and accurate ride-matching. The RS uses masked location information\nto match RCs and RVs within a quadrant without obtaining their exact locations,\nthus ensuring privacy. In this work, we disprove the privacy claims in TRACE by\nshowing the following: a) RCs and RVs can identify the secret spatial division\nmaintained by RS (this reveals information about the density of RVs in the\nregion and other potential trade secrets), and b) the RS can identify exact\nlocations of RCs and RVs (this violates location privacy). Prior to exchanging\nencrypted messages in the TRACE protocol, each entity masks the plaintext\nmessage with a secret unknown to others. Our attack allows other entities to\nrecover this plaintext from the masked value by exploiting shared randomness\nused across different messages, that eventually leads to a system of linear\nequations in the unknown plaintexts. This holds even when all the participating\nentities are honest-but-curious. We implement our attack and demonstrate its\nefficiency and high success rate. For the security parameters recommended for\nTRACE, an RV can recover the spatial division in less than a minute, and the RS\ncan recover the location of an RV in less than a second on a commodity laptop.",

But when the robot operates on\nhigh-dimensional inputs, like images or point clouds, this is impractical: the\nrobot needs an unrealistic amount of human effort to learn the new concept. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a new approach whereby the robot learns a\nlow-dimensional variant of the concept and uses it to generate a larger data\nset for learning the concept in the high-dimensional space. This lets it take\nadvantage of semantically meaningful privileged information only accessible at\ntraining time, like object poses and bounding boxes, that allows for richer\nhuman interaction to speed up learning. We evaluate our approach by learning\nprepositional concepts that describe object state or multi-object\nrelationships, like above, near, or aligned, which are key to user\nspecification of task goals and execution constraints for robots. Using a\nsimulated human, we show that our approach improves sample complexity when\ncompared to learning concepts directly in the high-dimensional space.

So, it is of the essence to develop a method that is\nscalable in low computational time. Hence, we propose a deep learning model for\nthe identification of nodes with high Eigenvector Centrality. There have been a\nfew previous works in identifying the high ranked nodes with supervised\nlearning methods, but in real-world cases, the graphs are not labelled and\nhence deployment of supervised learning methods becomes a hazard and its usage\nbecomes impractical. So, we devise CUL(Centrality with Unsupervised Learning)\nmethod to learn the relative EC scores in a network in an unsupervised manner.\nTo achieve this, we develop an Encoder-Decoder based framework that maps the\nnodes to their respective estimated EC scores. Extensive experiments were\nconducted on different synthetic and real-world networks. We compared CUL\nagainst a baseline supervised method for EC estimation similar to some of the\npast works. It was observed that even with training on a minuscule number of\ntraining datasets, CUL delivers a relatively better accuracy score when\nidentifying the higher ranked nodes than its supervised counterpart.

One major class of such scalable algorithms is known as network\nrepresentation learning or network embedding. These algorithms try to learn\nrepresentations of network functionals (e.g.~nodes) by first running multiple\nrandom walks and then using the number of co-occurrences of each pair of nodes\nin observed random walk segments to obtain a low-dimensional representation of\nnodes on some Euclidean space. The aim of this paper is to rigorously\nunderstand the performance of two major algorithms, DeepWalk and node2vec, in\nrecovering communities for canonical network models with ground truth\ncommunities. Depending on the sparsity of the graph, we find the length of the\nrandom walk segments required such that the corresponding observed\nco-occurrence window is able to perform almost exact recovery of the underlying\ncommunity assignments. We prove that, given some fixed co-occurrence window,\nnode2vec using random walks with a low non-backtracking probability can succeed\nfor much sparser networks compared to DeepWalk using simple random walks.\nMoreover, if the sparsity parameter is low, we provide evidence that these\nalgorithms might not succeed in almost exact recovery.

We first demonstrate that one can use this framework to\nexpress non-trivial (but sub-optimal) bounds for any learning algorithm that\noutputs hypotheses from a class of bounded VC dimension. We prove that the CMI\nframework yields the optimal bound on the expected risk of Support Vector\nMachines (SVMs) for learning halfspaces. This result is an application of our\ngeneral result showing that stable compression schemes Bousquet al. (2020) of\nsize $k$ have uniformly bounded CMI of order $O(k)$. We further show that an\ninherent limitation of proper learning of VC classes contradicts the existence\nof a proper learner with constant CMI, and it implies a negative resolution to\nan open problem of Steinke and Zakynthinou (2020). We further study the CMI of\nempirical risk minimizers (ERMs) of class $H$ and show that it is possible to\noutput all consistent classifiers (version space) with bounded CMI if and only\nif $H$ has a bounded star number (Hanneke and Yang (2015)). Moreover, we prove\na general reduction showing that \"leave-one-out\" analysis is expressible via\nthe CMI framework. As a corollary we investigate the CMI of the\none-inclusion-graph algorithm proposed by Haussler et al. (1994). More\ngenerally, we show that the CMI framework is universal in the sense that for\nevery consistent algorithm and data distribution, the expected risk vanishes as\nthe number of samples diverges if and only if its evaluated CMI has sublinear\ngrowth with the number of samples.",

    "title": "Competitive Sequencing with Noisy Advice",
    "abstract": "Several well-studied online resource allocation problems can be formulated in\nterms of infinite, increasing sequences of positive values, in which each\nelement is associated with a corresponding allocation value. Examples include\nproblems such as online bidding, searching for a hidden target on an unbounded\nline, and designing interruptible algorithms based on repeated executions. The\nperformance of the online algorithm, in each of these problems, is measured by\nthe competitive ratio, which describes the multiplicative performance loss due\nto the absence of full information on the instance.\nWe study such competitive sequencing problems in a setting in which the\nonline algorithm has some (potentially) erroneous information, expressed as a\n$k$-bit advice string, for some given $k$. We first consider the untrusted\nadvice setting of [Angelopoulos et al, ITCS 2020], in which the objective is to\nquantify performance considering two extremes: either the advice is either\nerror-free, or it is generated by a (malicious) adversary. Here, we show a\nPareto-optimal solution, using a new approach for applying the functional-based\nlower-bound technique due to [Gal, Israel J. Math. 1972]. Next, we study a\nnascent noisy advice setting, in which a number of the advice bits may be\nerroneous; the exact error is unknown to the online algorithm, which only has\naccess to a pessimistic estimate (i.e., an upper bound on this error). We give\nimproved upper bounds, but also the first lower bound on the competitive ratio\nof an online problem in this setting. To this end, we combine ideas from robust\nquery-based search in arrays, and fault-tolerant contract scheduling. Last, we\ndemonstrate how to apply the above techniques in robust optimization without\npredictions, and discuss how they can be applicable in the context of more\ngeneral online problems.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) and the field of Neuromorphic Engineering has\nbrought about a paradigm shift in how to approach Machine Learning (ML) and\nComputer Vision (CV) problem. This paradigm shift comes from the adaption of\nevent-based sensing and processing. An event-based vision sensor allows for\nsparse and asynchronous events to be produced that are dynamically related to\nthe scene. Allowing not only the spatial information but a high-fidelity of\ntemporal information to be captured. Meanwhile avoiding the extra overhead and\nredundancy of conventional high frame rate approaches. However, with this\nchange in paradigm, many techniques from traditional CV and ML are not\napplicable to these event-based spatial-temporal visual streams. As such a\nlimited number of recognition, detection and segmentation approaches exist. In\nthis paper, we present a novel approach that can perform instance segmentation\nusing just the weights of a Spike Time Dependent Plasticity trained Spiking\nConvolutional Neural Network that was trained for object recognition. This\nexploits the spatial and temporal aspects of the network's internal feature\nrepresentations adding this new discriminative capability. We highlight the new\ncapability by successfully transforming a single class unsupervised network for\nface detection into a multi-person face recognition and instance segmentation\nnetwork.",

Event-driven applications are prone to concurrency\nbugs that involve subtle errors in reasoning about the ordering of events.\nUnfortunately, there are several challenges in using existing model-checking\ntechniques on these systems. Event-driven applications often loop indefinitely\nand thus pose a challenge for stateless model checking techniques.

    "title": "Sliced Recursive Transformer",
    "abstract": "We present a neat yet effective recursive operation on vision transformers\nthat can improve parameter utilization without involving additional parameters.\nThis is achieved by sharing weights across depth of transformer networks. The\nproposed method can obtain a substantial gain (~2%) simply using na\\\"ive\nrecursive operation, requires no special or sophisticated knowledge for\ndesigning principles of networks, and introduces minimum computational overhead\nto the training procedure. To reduce the additional computation caused by\nrecursive operation while maintaining the superior accuracy, we propose an\napproximating method through multiple sliced group self-attentions across\nrecursive layers which can reduce the cost consumption by 10~30% with minimal\nperformance loss. We call our model Sliced Recursive Transformer (SReT), which\nis compatible with a broad range of other designs for efficient vision\ntransformers. Our best model establishes significant improvement on ImageNet\nover state-of-the-art methods while containing fewer parameters. The proposed\nsliced recursive operation allows us to build a transformer with more than 100\nor even 1000 layers effortlessly under a still small size (13~15M), to avoid\ndifficulties in optimization when the model size is too large. The flexible\nscalability has shown great potential for scaling up and constructing extremely\ndeep and large dimensionality vision transformers.

    "abstract": "Motivated by neuroscientific and clinical applications, we empirically\nexamine whether observational measures of information flow can suggest\ninterventions. We do so by performing experiments on artificial neural networks\nin the context of fairness in machine learning, where the goal is to induce\nfairness in the system through interventions. Using our recently developed\n$M$-information flow framework, we measure the flow of information about the\ntrue label (responsible for accuracy, and hence desirable), and separately, the\nflow of information about a protected attribute (responsible for bias, and\nhence undesirable) on the edges of a trained neural network. We then compare\nthe flow magnitudes against the effect of intervening on those edges by\npruning. We show that pruning edges that carry larger information flows about\nthe protected attribute reduces bias at the output to a greater extent. This\ndemonstrates that $M$-information flow can meaningfully suggest targets for\ninterventions, answering the title's question in the affirmative. We also\nevaluate bias-accuracy tradeoffs for different intervention strategies, to\nanalyze how one might use estimates of desirable and undesirable information\nflows (here, accuracy and bias flows) to inform interventions that preserve the\nformer while reducing the latter.",

    "title": "Adaptable Register File Organization for Vector Processors",
    "abstract": "Modern scientific applications are getting more diverse, and the vector\nlengths in those applications vary widely. Contemporary Vector Processors (VPs)\nare designed either for short vector lengths, e.g., Fujitsu A64FX with 512-bit\nARM SVE vector support, or long vectors, e.g., NEC Aurora Tsubasa with 16Kbits\nMaximum Vector Length (MVL). Unfortunately, both approaches have drawbacks. On\nthe one hand, short vector length VP designs struggle to provide high\nefficiency for applications featuring long vectors with high Data Level\nParallelism (DLP). On the other hand, long vector VP designs waste resources\nand underutilize the Vector Register File (VRF) when executing low DLP\napplications with short vector lengths. Therefore, those long vector VP\nimplementations are limited to a specialized subset of applications, where\nrelatively high DLP must be present to achieve excellent performance with high\nefficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose an Adaptable Vector\nArchitecture (AVA) that leads to having the best of both worlds. AVA is\ndesigned for short vectors (MVL=16 elements) and is thus area and\nenergy-efficient. However, AVA has the functionality to reconfigure the MVL,\nthereby allowing to exploit the benefits of having a longer vector (up to 128\nelements) microarchitecture when abundant DLP is present. We model AVA on the\ngem5 simulator and evaluate the performance with six applications taken from\nthe RiVEC Benchmark Suite. To obtain area and power consumption metrics, we\nmodel AVA on McPAT for 22nm technology. Our results show that by reconfiguring\nour small VRF (8KB) plus our novel issue queue scheme, AVA yields a 2X speedup\nover the default configuration for short vectors. Additionally, AVA shows\ncompetitive performance when compared to a long vector VP, while saving 50% of\narea.",

    "abstract": "For a given distribution, learning algorithm, and performance metric, the\nrate of convergence (or data-scaling law) is the asymptotic behavior of the\nalgorithm's test performance as a function of number of train samples. Many\nlearning methods in both theory and practice have power-law rates, i.e.\nperformance scales as $n^{-\\alpha}$ for some $\\alpha > 0$. Moreover, both\ntheoreticians and practitioners are concerned with improving the rates of their\nlearning algorithms under settings of interest. We observe the existence of a\n\"universal learner\", which achieves the best possible distribution-dependent\nasymptotic rate among all learning algorithms within a specified runtime (e.g.\n$O(n^2)$), while incurring only polylogarithmic slowdown over this runtime.\nThis algorithm is uniform, and does not depend on the distribution, and yet\nachieves best-possible rates for all distributions. The construction itself is\na simple extension of Levin's universal search (Levin, 1973).

To tackle this challenge, we\npropose variational multi-task learning (VMTL), a general probabilistic\ninference framework for learning multiple related tasks.

To incorporate shared\nknowledge into each task, we design the prior of a task to be a learnable\nmixture of the variational posteriors of other related tasks, which is learned\nby the Gumbel-Softmax technique. In contrast to previous methods, our VMTL can\nexploit task relatedness for both representations and classifiers in a\nprincipled way by jointly inferring their posteriors. This enables individual\ntasks to fully leverage inductive biases provided by related tasks, therefore\nimproving the overall performance of all tasks. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed VMTL is able to effectively tackle a variety of\nchallenging multi-task learning settings with limited training data for both\nclassification and regression.

This task\nis of great clinical significance but extremely challenging due to bleeding,\nlighting reflection, and motion blur in the complicated surgical environment.\nCompared with existing solutions, which either neglect geometric relationships\namong targeting objects or capture the relationships by using complicated\naggregation schemes, the proposed network is capable of achieving satisfactory\naccuracy while maintaining real-time performance by taking full advantage of\nthe spatial relations among landmarks. We first devise an algorithm to\nautomatically generate relation keypoint heatmaps, which are able to\nintuitively represent the prior knowledge of spatial relations among landmarks\nwithout using any extra manual annotation efforts. We then develop two\ncomplementary regularization schemes to progressively incorporate the prior\nknowledge into the training process. While one scheme introduces pixel-level\nregularization by multi-task learning, the other integrates global-level\nregularization by harnessing a newly designed grouped consistency evaluator,\nwhich adds relation constraints to the proposed network in an adversarial\nmanner. Both schemes are beneficial to the model in training, and can be\nreadily unloaded in inference to achieve real-time detection. We establish a\nlarge in-house dataset of ESD surgery for esophageal cancer to validate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of\naccuracy and efficiency, achieving better detection results faster.

Recent advancements in diagnostic\nactivities combined with large-scale screening policies have significantly\nlowered the mortality rates for breast cancer patients. However, the manual\ninspection of tissue slides by the pathologists is cumbersome, time-consuming,\nand is subject to significant inter- and intra-observer variability. Recently,\nthe advent of whole-slide scanning systems have empowered the rapid\ndigitization of pathology slides, and enabled to develop digital workflows.\nThese advances further enable to leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) to\nassist, automate, and augment pathological diagnosis. But the AI techniques,\nespecially Deep Learning (DL), require a large amount of high-quality annotated\ndata to learn from. Constructing such task-specific datasets poses several\nchallenges, such as, data-acquisition level constrains, time-consuming and\nexpensive annotations, and anonymization of private information. In this paper,\nwe introduce the BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping (BRACS) dataset, a large cohort of\nannotated Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E)-stained images to facilitate the\ncharacterization of breast lesions. BRACS contains 547 Whole-Slide Images\n(WSIs), and 4539 Regions of Interest (ROIs) extracted from the WSIs. Each WSI,\nand respective ROIs, are annotated by the consensus of three board-certified\npathologists into different lesion categories. Specifically, BRACS includes\nthree lesion types, i.e., benign, malignant and atypical, which are further\nsubtyped into seven categories. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the\nlargest annotated dataset for breast cancer subtyping both at WSI- and\nROI-level. Further, by including the understudied atypical lesions, BRACS\noffers an unique opportunity for leveraging AI to better understand their\ncharacteristics.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method to address the long-standing problem of lack\nof monotonicity in estimation of the conditional and structural quantile\nfunction, also known as quantile crossing problem. Quantile regression is a\nvery powerful tool in data science in general and econometrics in particular.\nUnfortunately, the crossing problem has been confounding researchers and\npractitioners alike for over 4 decades. Numerous attempts have been made to\nfind an acceptable solution but no simple and general solution has been found\nto date. This paper describes an elegant solution to the problem which is based\non a single mathematical equation that is easy to understand and implement in R\nand Python, while greatly reducing the crossing problem. It will be very\nimportant in all areas where quantile regression is routinely used and may also\nfind application in robust regression, especially in the context of machine\nlearning.",

The proposed method actively queries the label of\ninformative instance pairs, while estimating underlying metrics by\nincorporating unlabeled instance pairs, which leads to a more accurate and\nefficient clustering process. In particular, we augment the queried constraints\nby generating more pairwise labels to provide additional information in\nlearning a metric to enhance clustering performance. Furthermore, we increase\nthe robustness of metric learning by updating the learned metric sequentially\nand penalizing the irrelevant features adaptively. In addition, we propose a\nnovel active query strategy that evaluates the information gain of instance\npairs more accurately by incorporating the neighborhood structure, which\nimproves clustering efficiency without extra labeling cost. In theory, we\nprovide a tighter error bound of the proposed metric learning method utilizing\naugmented queries compared with methods using existing constraints only.\nFurthermore, we also investigate the improvement using the active query\nstrategy instead of random selection.

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural network-based MR reconstruction methods have shown to\nprovide fast and high quality reconstructions. A primary drawback with a\nCNN-based model is that it lacks flexibility and can effectively operate only\nfor a specific acquisition context limiting practical applicability. By\nacquisition context, we mean a specific combination of three input settings\nconsidered namely, the anatomy under study, undersampling mask pattern and\nacceleration factor for undersampling. The model could be trained jointly on\nimages combining multiple contexts. However the model does not meet the\nperformance of context specific models nor extensible to contexts unseen at\ntrain time. This necessitates a modification to the existing architecture in\ngenerating context specific weights so as to incorporate flexibility to\nmultiple contexts. We propose a multiple acquisition context based network,\ncalled MAC-ReconNet for MRI reconstruction, flexible to multiple acquisition\ncontexts and generalizable to unseen contexts for applicability in real\nscenarios. The proposed network has an MRI reconstruction module and a dynamic\nweight prediction (DWP) module. The DWP module takes the corresponding\nacquisition context information as input and learns the context-specific\nweights of the reconstruction module which changes dynamically with context at\nrun time. We show that the proposed approach can handle multiple contexts based\non cardiac and brain datasets, Gaussian and Cartesian undersampling patterns\nand five acceleration factors. The proposed network outperforms the naive\njointly trained model and gives competitive results with the context-specific\nmodels both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also demonstrate the\ngeneralizability of our model by testing on contexts unseen at train time.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, multi-factor strategies have gained increasing popularity in\nthe financial industry, as they allow investors to have a better understanding\nof the risk drivers underlying their portfolios. Moreover, such strategies\npromise to promote diversification and thus limit losses in times of financial\nturmoil. However, recent studies have reported a significant level of\nredundancy between these factors, which might enhance risk contagion among\nmulti-factor portfolios during financial crises. Therefore, it is of\nfundamental importance to better understand the relationships among factors.\nEmpowered by recent advances in causal structure learning methods, this paper\npresents a study of the causal structure of financial risk factors and its\nevolution over time. In particular, the data we analyze covers 11 risk factors\nconcerning the US equity market, spanning a period of 29 years at daily\nfrequency.\nOur results show a statistically significant sparsifying trend of the\nunderlying causal structure. However, this trend breaks down during periods of\nfinancial stress, in which we can observe a densification of the causal network\ndriven by a growth of the out-degree of the market factor node. Finally, we\npresent a comparison with the analysis of factors cross-correlations, which\nfurther confirms the importance of causal analysis for gaining deeper insights\nin the dynamics of the factor system, particularly during economic downturns.\nOur findings are especially significant from a risk-management perspective.\nThey link the evolution of the causal structure of equity risk factors with\nmarket volatility and a worsening macroeconomic environment, and show that, in\ntimes of financial crisis, exposure to different factors boils down to exposure\nto the market risk factor.",

    "abstract": "Individual device loads and energy consumption feedback is one of the\nimportant approaches for pursuing users to save energy in residences. This can\nhelp in identifying faulty devices and wasted energy by devices when left On\nunused. The main challenge is to identity and estimate the energy consumption\nof individual devices without intrusive sensors on each device. Non-intrusive\nload monitoring (NILM) or energy disaggregation, is a blind source separation\nproblem which requires a system to estimate the electricity usage of individual\nappliances from the aggregated household energy consumption. In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep neural network-based approach for performing load\ndisaggregation on low frequency power data obtained from residential\nhouseholds. We combine a series of one-dimensional Convolutional Neural\nNetworks and Long Short Term Memory (1D CNN-LSTM) to extract features that can\nidentify active appliances and retrieve their power consumption given the\naggregated household power value. We used CNNs to extract features from main\nreadings in a given time frame and then used those features to classify if a\ngiven appliance is active at that time period or not. Following that, the\nextracted features are used to model a generation problem using LSTM. We train\nthe LSTM to generate the disaggregated energy consumption of a particular\nappliance. Our neural network is capable of generating detailed feedback of\ndemand-side, providing vital insights to the end-user about their electricity\nconsumption. The algorithm was designed for low power offline devices such as\nESP32.

    "title": "Approaching the Limit of Image Rescaling via Flow Guidance",
    "abstract": "Image downscaling and upscaling are two basic rescaling operations. Once the\nimage is downscaled, it is difficult to be reconstructed via upscaling due to\nthe loss of information. To make these two processes more compatible and\nimprove the reconstruction performance, some efforts model them as a joint\nencoding-decoding task, with the constraint that the downscaled (i.e. encoded)\nlow-resolution (LR) image must preserve the original visual appearance. To\nimplement this constraint, most methods guide the downscaling module by\nsupervising it with the bicubically downscaled LR version of the original\nhigh-resolution (HR) image. However, this bicubic LR guidance may be suboptimal\nfor the subsequent upscaling (i.e. decoding) and restrict the final\nreconstruction performance. In this paper, instead of directly applying the LR\nguidance, we propose an additional invertible flow guidance module (FGM), which\ncan transform the downscaled representation to the visually plausible image\nduring downscaling and transform it back during upscaling. Benefiting from the\ninvertibility of FGM, the downscaled representation could get rid of the LR\nguidance and would not disturb the downscaling-upscaling process. It allows us\nto remove the restrictions on the downscaling module and optimize the\ndownscaling and upscaling modules in an end-to-end manner. In this way, these\ntwo modules could cooperate to maximize the HR reconstruction performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve\nstate-of-the-art (SotA) performance on both downscaled and reconstructed\nimages.",

    "title": "Leveraging blur information for plenoptic camera calibration",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel calibration algorithm for plenoptic cameras,\nespecially the multi-focus configuration, where several types of micro-lenses\nare used, using raw images only. Current calibration methods rely on simplified\nprojection models, use features from reconstructed images, or require separated\ncalibrations for each type of micro-lens. In the multi-focus configuration, the\nsame part of a scene will demonstrate different amounts of blur according to\nthe micro-lens focal length. Usually, only micro-images with the smallest\namount of blur are used. In order to exploit all available data, we propose to\nexplicitly model the defocus blur in a new camera model with the help of our\nnewly introduced Blur Aware Plenoptic (BAP) feature. First, it is used in a\npre-calibration step that retrieves initial camera parameters, and second, to\nexpress a new cost function to be minimized in our single optimization process.\nThird, it is exploited to calibrate the relative blur between micro-images. It\nlinks the geometric blur, i.e., the blur circle, to the physical blur, i.e.,\nthe point spread function. Finally, we use the resulting blur profile to\ncharacterize the camera's depth of field. Quantitative evaluations in\ncontrolled environment on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our\ncalibrations.",

    "title": "Stress field prediction in fiber-reinforced composite materials using a  deep learning approach",
    "abstract": "Computational stress analysis is an important step in the design of material\nsystems. Finite element method (FEM) is a standard approach of performing\nstress analysis of complex material systems. A way to accelerate stress\nanalysis is to replace FEM with a data-driven machine learning based stress\nanalysis approach. In this study, we consider a fiber-reinforced matrix\ncomposite material system and we use deep learning tools to find an alternative\nto the FEM approach for stress field prediction. We first try to predict stress\nfield maps for composite material systems of fixed number of fibers with\nvarying spatial configurations. Specifically, we try to find a mapping between\nthe spatial arrangement of the fibers in the composite material and the\ncorresponding von Mises stress field. This is achieved by using a convolutional\nneural network (CNN), specifically a U-Net architecture, using true stress maps\nof systems with same number of fibers as training data. U-Net is a\nencoder-decoder network which in this study takes in the composite material\nimage as an input and outputs the stress field image which is of the same size\nas the input image. We perform a robustness analysis by taking different\ninitializations of the training samples to find the sensitivity of the\nprediction accuracy to the small number of training samples. When the number of\nfibers in the composite material system is increased for the same volume\nfraction, a finer finite element mesh discretization is required to represent\nthe geometry accurately. This leads to an increase in the computational cost.\nThus, the secondary goal here is to predict the stress field for systems with\nlarger number of fibers with varying spatial configurations using information\nfrom the true stress maps of relatively cheaper systems of smaller fiber\nnumber.",

    "abstract": "Modern quantum machine learning (QML) methods involve variationally\noptimizing a parameterized quantum circuit on a training data set, and\nsubsequently making predictions on a testing data set (i.e., generalizing). In\nthis work, we provide a comprehensive study of generalization performance in\nQML after training on a limited number $N$ of training data points. We show\nthat the generalization error of a quantum machine learning model with $T$\ntrainable gates scales at worst as $\\sqrt{T/N}$. When only $K \\ll T$ gates have\nundergone substantial change in the optimization process, we prove that the\ngeneralization error improves to $\\sqrt{K / N}$. Our results imply that the\ncompiling of unitaries into a polynomial number of native gates, a crucial\napplication for the quantum computing industry that typically uses\nexponential-size training data, can be sped up significantly. We also show that\nclassification of quantum states across a phase transition with a quantum\nconvolutional neural network requires only a very small training data set.\nOther potential applications include learning quantum error correcting codes or\nquantum dynamical simulation. Our work injects new hope into the field of QML,\nas good generalization is guaranteed from few training data.",

    "abstract": "Polarization of the mammalian embryo at the right developmental time is\ncritical for its development to term and would be valuable in assessing the\npotential of human embryos. However, tracking polarization requires invasive\nfluorescence staining, impermissible in the in vitro fertilization clinic.\nHere, we report the use of artificial intelligence to detect polarization from\nunstained time-lapse movies of mouse embryos. We assembled a dataset of\nbright-field movie frames from 8-cell-stage embryos, side-by-side with\ncorresponding images of fluorescent markers of cell polarization. We then used\nan ensemble learning model to detect whether any bright-field frame showed an\nembryo before or after onset of polarization. Our resulting model has an\naccuracy of 85% for detecting polarization, significantly outperforming human\nvolunteers trained on the same data (61% accuracy). We discovered that our\nself-learning model focuses upon the angle between cells as one known cue for\ncompaction, which precedes polarization, but it outperforms the use of this cue\nalone. By compressing three-dimensional time-lapsed image data into\ntwo-dimensions, we are able to reduce data to an easily manageable size for\ndeep learning processing. In conclusion, we describe a method for detecting a\nkey developmental feature of embryo development that avoids clinically\nimpermissible fluorescence staining.",
