    "abstract": "Informative planning seeks a sequence of actions that guide the robot to\ncollect the most informative data to map a large environment or learn a\ndynamical system. Existing work in informative planning mainly focus on\nproposing new planners, and applying them to various robotic applications such\nas environmental monitoring, autonomous exploration, and system identification.\nThe informative planners optimize an objective given by a probabilistic model,\ne.g. Gaussian process regression. In practice, the model can be easily affected\nby the ubiquitous sensing outliers, resulting in a misleading objective. A\nstraightforward solution is to filter out the outliers in the sensing data\nstream using an off-the-shelf outlier detector. However, informative samples\nare also scarce by definition, so they might be falsely filtered out. In this\npaper, we propose a method to enable the robot to re-visit the locations where\noutliers were sampled besides optimizing the informative planning objective. By\ndoing so, the robot can collect more samples in the vicinity of outliers and\nupdate the outlier detector to reduce the number of false alarms. This is\nachieved by designing a new objective on top of a Pareto variant of Monte Carlo\ntree search. We demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves better\nperformance than simply applying an outlier detector.",

The\nmethod produces optimized decision solutions for the robot based on its\nknowledge (estimation) of the environment state, leading to better adaptation\nto environmental dynamics.

    "abstract": "We consider the single-item interdependent value setting, where there is a\nmonopolist, $n$ buyers, and each buyer has a private signal $s_i$ describing a\npiece of information about the item. Each bidder $i$ also has a valuation\nfunction $v_i(s_1,\\ldots,s_n)$ mapping the (private) signals of all buyers to a\npositive real number representing their value for the item. This setting\ncaptures scenarios where the item's information is asymmetric or dispersed\namong agents, such as in competitions for oil drilling rights, or in auctions\nfor art pieces. Due to the increased complexity of this model compared to\nstandard private values, it is generally assumed that each bidder's valuation\nfunction $v_i$ is public knowledge. But in many situations, the seller may not\nknow how a bidder aggregates signals into a valuation. In this paper, we design\nmechanisms that guarantee approximately-optimal social welfare while satisfying\nex-post incentive compatibility and individual rationality for the case where\nthe valuation functions are private to the bidders.\nWhen the valuations are public, it is possible for optimal social welfare to\nbe attained by a deterministic mechanism under a single-crossing condition. In\ncontrast, when the valuations are the bidders' private information, we show\nthat no finite bound can be achieved by any deterministic mechanism even under\nsingle-crossing.\nMoreover, no randomized mechanism can guarantee better than an\n$n$-approximation. We thus consider valuation functions that are submodular\nover signals (SOS), introduced in the context of combinatorial auctions in a\nrecent breakthrough paper by Eden et al. [EC'19]. Our main result is an\n$O(\\log^2 n)$-approximation for buyers with private signals and valuations\nunder the SOS condition. We also give a tight $\\Theta(k)$-approximation for the\ncase each agent's valuation depends on at most $k$ other signals even for\nunknown $k$.",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) and dynamic Bayesian networks\n(DBNs) are widely used sequence models with complementary strengths and\nlimitations. While PCFGs allow for nested hierarchical dependencies (tree\nstructures), their latent variables (non-terminal symbols) have to be discrete.\nIn contrast, DBNs allow for continuous latent variables, but the dependencies\nare strictly sequential (chain structure). Therefore, neither can be applied if\nthe latent variables are assumed to be continuous and also to have a nested\nhierarchical dependency structure. In this paper, we present Recursive Bayesian\nNetworks (RBNs), which generalise and unify PCFGs and DBNs, combining their\nstrengths and containing both as special cases. RBNs define a joint\ndistribution over tree-structured Bayesian networks with discrete or continuous\nlatent variables. The main challenge lies in performing joint inference over\nthe exponential number of possible structures and the continuous variables. We\nprovide two solutions: 1) For arbitrary RBNs, we generalise inside and outside\nprobabilities from PCFGs to the mixed discrete-continuous case, which allows\nfor maximum posterior estimates of the continuous latent variables via gradient\ndescent, while marginalising over network structures. 2) For Gaussian RBNs, we\nadditionally derive an analytic approximation, allowing for robust parameter\noptimisation and Bayesian inference. The capacity and diverse applications of\nRBNs are illustrated on two examples: In a quantitative evaluation on synthetic\ndata, we demonstrate and discuss the advantage of RBNs for segmentation and\ntree induction from noisy sequences, compared to change point detection and\nhierarchical clustering. In an application to musical data, we approach the\nunsolved problem of hierarchical music analysis from the raw note level and\ncompare our results to expert annotations.",

    "abstract": "The experience replay mechanism allows agents to use the experiences multiple\ntimes. In prior works, the sampling probability of the transitions was adjusted\naccording to their importance. Reassigning sampling probabilities for every\ntransition in the replay buffer after each iteration is highly inefficient.\nTherefore, experience replay prioritization algorithms recalculate the\nsignificance of a transition when the corresponding transition is sampled to\ngain computational efficiency. However, the importance level of the transitions\nchanges dynamically as the policy and the value function of the agent are\nupdated. In addition, experience replay stores the transitions are generated by\nthe previous policies of the agent that may significantly deviate from the most\nrecent policy of the agent. Higher deviation from the most recent policy of the\nagent leads to more off-policy updates, which is detrimental for the agent. In\nthis paper, we develop a novel algorithm, Batch Prioritizing Experience Replay\nvia KL Divergence (KLPER), which prioritizes batch of transitions rather than\ndirectly prioritizing each transition. Moreover, to reduce the off-policyness\nof the updates, our algorithm selects one batch among a certain number of\nbatches and forces the agent to learn through the batch that is most likely\ngenerated by the most recent policy of the agent. We combine our algorithm with\nDeep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient and evaluate it on various continuous control tasks. KLPER provides\npromising improvements for deep deterministic continuous control algorithms in\nterms of sample efficiency, final performance, and stability of the policy\nduring the training.",

    "title": "AIT* and EIT*: Asymmetric bidirectional sampling-based path planning",
    "abstract": "Optimal path planning is the problem of finding a valid sequence of states\nbetween a start and goal that optimizes an objective. Informed path planning\nalgorithms order their search with problem-specific knowledge expressed as\nheuristics and can be orders of magnitude more efficient than uninformed\nalgorithms. Heuristics are most effective when they are both accurate and\ncomputationally inexpensive to evaluate, but these are often conflicting\ncharacteristics. This makes the selection of appropriate heuristics difficult\nfor many problems.\nThis paper presents two almost-surely asymptotically optimal sampling-based\npath planning algorithms to address this challenge, Adaptively Informed Trees\n(AIT*) and Effort Informed Trees (EIT*). These algorithms use an asymmetric\nbidirectional search in which both searches continuously inform each other.\nThis allows AIT* and EIT* to improve planning performance by simultaneously\ncalculating and exploiting increasingly accurate, problem-specific heuristics.\nThe benefits of AIT* and EIT* relative to other sampling-based algorithms are\ndemonstrated on twelve problems in abstract, robotic, and biomedical domains\noptimizing path length and obstacle clearance. The experiments show that AIT*\nand EIT* outperform other algorithms on problems optimizing obstacle clearance,\nwhere a priori cost heuristics are often ineffective, and still perform well on\nproblems minimizing path length, where such heuristics are often effective.",

    "abstract": "The residential buildings sector is one of the largest electricity consumers\nworldwide and contributes disproportionally to peak electricity demand in many\nregions. Strongly driven by occupant activities at home, household energy\nconsumption is stochastic and heterogeneous in nature. However, most\nresidential building energy models applied by industry use homogeneous,\ndeterministic occupant activity schedules, which work well for predictions of\nannual energy consumption, but can result in unrealistic hourly or sub-hourly\nelectric load profiles, with exaggerated or muted peaks. This mattered less in\nthe past, but the increasing proportion of variable renewable energy generators\nin power systems means that representing the heterogeneity and stochasticity of\noccupant behavior is crucial for reliable energy planning. This is particularly\ntrue for systems that include distributed energy resources, such as\ngrid-interactive efficient buildings, solar photovoltaics, and battery storage.\nThis work presents a stochastic occupant behavior simulator that models the\nenergy use behavior of individual household members. It also presents an\nintegration with a building stock model to simulate residential building loads\nmore accurately at community, city, state, and national scales. More\nspecifically, we first employ clustering techniques to identify distinct\npatterns of occupant behavior. Then, we combine time-inhomogeneous Markov chain\nsimulations with probabilistic sampling of event durations to realistically\nsimulate occupant behaviors. This stochastic simulator is integrated with\nResStock, a large-scale residential building stock simulation tool, to\ndemonstrate the capability of stochastic residential building load modeling at\nscale. The simulation results were validated against both American Time Use\nSurvey data and measured end-use electricity data for accuracy and reliability.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of multi-person 3D body pose and shape estimation from\na single image. While this problem can be addressed by applying single-person\napproaches multiple times for the same scene, recent works have shown the\nadvantages of building upon deep architectures that simultaneously reason about\nall people in the scene in a holistic manner by enforcing, e.g., depth order\nconstraints or minimizing interpenetration among reconstructed bodies. However,\nexisting approaches are still unable to capture the size variability of people\ncaused by the inherent body scale and depth ambiguity. In this work, we tackle\nthis challenge by devising a novel optimization scheme that learns the\nappropriate body scale and relative camera pose, by enforcing the feet of all\npeople to remain on the ground floor. A thorough evaluation on MuPoTS-3D and\n3DPW datasets demonstrates that our approach is able to robustly estimate the\nbody translation and shape of multiple people while retrieving their spatial\narrangement, consistently improving current state-of-the-art, especially in\nscenes with people of very different heights",

This goes in parallel with misuse\nepisodes, with an evident threat to the safety of people or facilities. As a\nresult, the detection of UAV has also emerged as a research topic. Most studies\non drone detection fail to specify the type of acquisition device, the drone\ntype, the detection range, or the dataset. The lack of proper UAV detection\nstudies employing thermal infrared cameras is also an issue, despite its\nsuccess with other targets. Besides, we have not found any previous study that\naddresses the detection task as a function of distance to the target. Sensor\nfusion is indicated as an open research issue as well, although research in\nthis direction is scarce too. To counteract the mentioned issues and allow\nfundamental studies with a common public benchmark, we contribute with an\nannotated multi-sensor database for drone detection that includes infrared and\nvisible videos and audio files. The database includes three different drones,\nof different sizes and other flying objects that can be mistakenly detected as\ndrones, such as birds, airplanes or helicopters. In addition to using several\ndifferent sensors, the number of classes is higher than in previous studies. To\nallow studies as a function of the sensor-to-target distance, the dataset is\ndivided into three categories (Close, Medium, Distant) according to the\nindustry-standard Detect, Recognize and Identify (DRI) requirements, built on\nthe Johnson criteria. Given that the drones must be flown within visual range\ndue to regulations, the largest sensor-to-target distance for a drone is 200 m,\nand acquisitions are made in daylight. The data has been obtained at three\nairports in Sweden: Halmstad Airport (IATA code: HAD/ICAO code: ESMT),\nGothenburg City Airport (GSE/ESGP) and Malm\\\"o Airport (MMX/ESMS).",

    "abstract": "Learning representations through deep generative modeling is a powerful\napproach for dynamical modeling to discover the most simplified and compressed\nunderlying description of the data, to then use it for other tasks such as\nprediction. Most learning tasks have intrinsic symmetries, i.e., the input\ntransformations leave the output unchanged, or the output undergoes a similar\ntransformation. The learning process is, however, usually uninformed of these\nsymmetries. Therefore, the learned representations for individually transformed\ninputs may not be meaningfully related. In this paper, we propose an SO(3)\nequivariant deep dynamical model (EqDDM) for motion prediction that learns a\nstructured representation of the input space in the sense that the embedding\nvaries with symmetry transformations. EqDDM is equipped with equivariant\nnetworks to parameterize the state-space emission and transition models.

    "title": "Trajectory Splitting: A Distributed Formulation for Collision Avoiding  Trajectory Optimization",
    "abstract": "Efficient trajectory optimization is essential for avoiding collisions in\nunstructured environments, but it remains challenging to have both speed and\nquality in the solutions. One reason is that second-order optimality requires\ncalculating Hessian matrices that can grow with $O(N^2)$ with the number of\nwaypoints. Decreasing the waypoints can quadratically decrease computation\ntime. Unfortunately, fewer waypoints result in lower quality trajectories that\nmay not avoid the collision. To have both, dense waypoints and reduced\ncomputation time, we took inspiration from recent studies on consensus\noptimization and propose a distributed formulation of collocated trajectory\noptimization. It breaks a long trajectory into several segments, where each\nsegment becomes a subproblem of a few waypoints. These subproblems are solved\nclassically, but in parallel, and the solutions are fused into a single\ntrajectory with a consensus constraint that enforces continuity of the segments\nthrough a consensus update. With this scheme, the quadratic complexity is\ndistributed to each segment and enables solving for higher-quality trajectories\nwith denser waypoints. Furthermore, the proposed formulation is amenable to\nusing any existing trajectory optimizer for solving the subproblems. We compare\nthe performance of our implementation of trajectory splitting against leading\nmotion planning algorithms and demonstrate the improved computational\nefficiency of our method.",

    "abstract": "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, robots could be seen as potential resources in\ntasks like helping people work remotely, sustaining social distancing, and\nimproving mental or physical health. To enhance human-robot interaction, it is\nessential for robots to become more socialised, via processing multiple social\ncues in a complex real-world environment. Our study adopted a neurorobotic\nparadigm of gaze-triggered audio-visual crossmodal integration to make an iCub\nrobot express human-like social attention responses. At first, a behavioural\nexperiment was conducted on 37 human participants. To improve ecological\nvalidity, a round-table meeting scenario with three masked animated avatars was\ndesigned with the middle one capable of performing gaze shift, and the other\ntwo capable of generating sound. The gaze direction and the sound location are\neither congruent or incongruent. Masks were used to cover all facial visual\ncues other than the avatars' eyes. We observed that the avatar's gaze could\ntrigger crossmodal social attention with better human performance in the\naudio-visual congruent condition than in the incongruent condition. Then, our\ncomputational model, GASP, was trained to implement social cue detection,\naudio-visual saliency prediction, and selective attention. After finishing the\nmodel training, the iCub robot was exposed to similar laboratory conditions as\nhuman participants, demonstrating that it can replicate similar attention\nresponses as humans regarding the congruency and incongruency performance,\nwhile overall the human performance was still superior. Therefore, this\ninterdisciplinary work provides new insights on mechanisms of crossmodal social\nattention and how it can be modelled in robots in a complex environment.",

These\ncomments are a major means of understanding viewer expectations and improving\nchannel engagement. However, the comments only represent a general collection\nof user opinions about the channel and the content. Many comments are poorly\nconstructed, trivial, and have improper spellings and grammatical errors. As a\nresult, it is a tedious job to identify the comments that best interest the\ncontent creators. In this paper, we extract and classify the raw comments into\ndifferent categories based on both sentiment and sentence types that will help\nYouTubers find relevant comments for growing their viewership. Existing studies\nhave focused either on sentiment analysis (positive and negative) or\nclassification of sub-types within the same sentence types (e.g., types of\nquestions) on a text corpus. These have limited application on non-traditional\ntext corpus like YouTube comments. We address this challenge of text extraction\nand classification from YouTube comments using well-known statistical measures\nand machine learning models. We evaluate each combination of statistical\nmeasure and the machine learning model using cross validation and $F_1$ scores.\nThe results show that our approach that incorporates conventional methods\nperforms well on the classification task, validating its potential in assisting\ncontent creators increase viewer engagement on their channel.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequence analysis plays a pivotal role in enabling many medical and\nscientific advancements in personalized medicine, outbreak tracing, and\nforensics. However, the analysis of genome sequencing data is currently\nbottlenecked by the computational power and memory bandwidth limitations of\nexisting systems. In this dissertation, we propose four major works, where we\ncharacterize the real-system behavior of the genome sequence analysis pipeline\nand its associated tools, expose the bottlenecks and tradeoffs, and co-design\nfast and efficient algorithms along with scalable and energy-efficient\ncustomized hardware accelerators for the key bottlenecks to enable faster\ngenome sequence analysis.\nFirst, we comprehensively analyze the tools in the genome assembly pipeline\nfor long reads in multiple dimensions, uncovering bottlenecks and tradeoffs\nthat different combinations of tools and different underlying systems lead to.\nSecond, we propose GenASM, an acceleration framework that builds upon\nbitvector-based approximate string matching to accelerate multiple steps of the\ngenome sequence analysis pipeline. We co-design our highly-parallel, scalable\nand memory-efficient algorithms with low-power and area-efficient hardware\naccelerators. Third, we implement an FPGA-based prototype for GenASM, where\nstate-of-the-art 3D-stacked memory offers high memory bandwidth and FPGA\nresources offer high parallelism. Fourth, we propose SeGraM, the first hardware\nacceleration framework for sequence-to-graph mapping and alignment. We\nco-design algorithms and accelerators for memory-efficient minimizer-based\nseeding and bitvector-based, highly-parallel sequence-to-graph alignment.\nOverall, we demonstrate that genome sequence analysis can be accelerated by\nco-designing scalable and energy-efficient customized accelerators along with\nefficient algorithms for the key steps of genome sequence analysis.",

    "title": "Discovering and Exploiting Sparse Rewards in a Learned Behavior Space",
    "abstract": "Learning optimal policies in sparse rewards settings is difficult as the\nlearning agent has little to no feedback on the quality of its actions. In\nthese situations, a good strategy is to focus on exploration, hopefully leading\nto the discovery of a reward signal to improve on. A learning algorithm capable\nof dealing with this kind of settings has to be able to (1) explore possible\nagent behaviors and (2) exploit any possible discovered reward. Efficient\nexploration algorithms have been proposed that require to define a behavior\nspace, that associates to an agent its resulting behavior in a space that is\nknown to be worth exploring. The need to define this space is a limitation of\nthese algorithms. In this work, we introduce STAX, an algorithm designed to\nlearn a behavior space on-the-fly and to explore it while efficiently\noptimizing any reward discovered. It does so by separating the exploration and\nlearning of the behavior space from the exploitation of the reward through an\nalternating two-steps process. In the first step, STAX builds a repertoire of\ndiverse policies while learning a low-dimensional representation of the\nhigh-dimensional observations generated during the policies evaluation. In the\nexploitation step, emitters are used to optimize the performance of the\ndiscovered rewarding solutions. Experiments conducted on three different sparse\nreward environments show that STAX performs comparably to existing baselines\nwhile requiring much less prior information about the task as it autonomously\nbuilds the behavior space.",

    "abstract": "Switched systems are known to exhibit subtle (in)stability behaviors\nrequiring system designers to carefully analyze the stability of closed-loop\nsystems that arise from their proposed switching control laws. This paper\npresents a formal approach for verifying switched system stability that blends\nclassical ideas from the controls and verification literature using\ndifferential dynamic logic (dL), a logic for deductive verification of hybrid\nsystems. From controls, we use standard stability notions for various classes\nof switching mechanisms and their corresponding Lyapunov function-based\nanalysis techniques. From verification, we use dL's ability to verify\nquantified properties of hybrid systems and dL models of switched systems as\nlooping hybrid programs whose stability can be formally specified and proven by\nfinding appropriate loop invariants, i.e., properties that are preserved across\neach loop iteration. This blend of ideas enables a trustworthy implementation\nof switched system stability verification in the KeYmaera X prover based on dL.\nFor standard classes of switching mechanisms, the implementation provides fully\nautomated stability proofs, including searching for suitable Lyapunov\nfunctions. Moreover, the generality of the deductive approach also enables\nverification of switching control laws that require non-standard stability\narguments through the design of loop invariants that suitably express specific\nintuitions behind those control laws. This flexibility is demonstrated on three\ncase studies: a model for longitudinal flight control by Branicky, an automatic\ncruise controller, and Brockett's nonholonomic integrator.",

Recent literature in fault-injection attacks shows\nthe severe DNN accuracy degradation caused by bit flips. In this scenario, the\nattacker changes a few weight bits during DNN execution by tampering with the\nprogram's DRAM memory. To detect runtime bit flips, HASHTAG extracts a unique\nsignature from the benign DNN prior to deployment. The signature is later used\nto validate the integrity of the DNN and verify the inference output on the\nfly. We propose a novel sensitivity analysis scheme that accurately identifies\nthe most vulnerable DNN layers to the fault-injection attack. The DNN signature\nis then constructed by encoding the underlying weights in the vulnerable layers\nusing a low-collision hash function. When the DNN is deployed, new hashes are\nextracted from the target layers during inference and compared against the\nground-truth signatures. HASHTAG incorporates a lightweight methodology that\nensures a low-overhead and real-time fault detection on embedded platforms.\nExtensive evaluations with the state-of-the-art bit-flip attack on various DNNs\ndemonstrate the competitive advantage of HASHTAG in terms of both attack\ndetection and execution overhead.",

Granular jamming is achieved via the application\nof a vacuum pressure inside a membrane containing particulate matter, and is\nparticularly interesting from a design perspective, as a myriad of design\nparameters can potentially be exploited to induce a diverse variety of useful\nbehaviours. To date, the effect of variables such as grain shape and size, as\nwell as membrane material, have been studied as a means of inducing bespoke\ngripping performance, however the other main contributing factor, membrane\nmorphology, has not been studied due to its particular complexities in both\naccurate modelling and fabrication.

    "abstract": "We present the One Pass ImageNet (OPIN) problem, which aims to study the\neffectiveness of deep learning in a streaming setting. ImageNet is a widely\nknown benchmark dataset that has helped drive and evaluate recent advancements\nin deep learning. Typically, deep learning methods are trained on static data\nthat the models have random access to, using multiple passes over the dataset\nwith a random shuffle at each epoch of training. Such data access assumption\ndoes not hold in many real-world scenarios where massive data is collected from\na stream and storing and accessing all the data becomes impractical due to\nstorage costs and privacy concerns. For OPIN, we treat the ImageNet data as\narriving sequentially, and there is limited memory budget to store a small\nsubset of the data. We observe that training a deep network in a single pass\nwith the same training settings used for multi-epoch training results in a huge\ndrop in prediction accuracy. We show that the performance gap can be\nsignificantly decreased by paying a small memory cost and utilizing techniques\ndeveloped for continual learning, despite the fact that OPIN differs from\ntypical continual problem settings. We propose using OPIN to study\nresource-efficient deep learning.",

In this study, a cooperative transportation system was\ndeveloped using rigidly attached aerial robots, and a decentralized controller\nwas proposed to guarantee asymptotic stability of the tracking error for\nunknown strictly positive real systems. A feedback controller was used to\ntransform unstable systems into strictly positive real ones using the shared\nattachment positions. First, the cooperative transportation of unknown payloads\nwith different shapes larger than the carrier robots was investigated through\nnumerical simulations. Second, cooperative transportation of an unknown payload\n(with a weight of about 2.7 kg and maximum length of 1.6 m) was demonstrated\nusing eight robots, even under robot failure. Finally, it was shown that the\nproposed system carried an unknown payload, even if the attachment positions\nwere not shared, that is, even if the asymptotic stability was not strictly\nguaranteed.",

This paper\nprovides a comprehensive review of epistemic uncertainty learning techniques in\nsupervised learning over the last five years.

Then, a hierarchical\ncategorization of epistemic uncertainty learning techniques along with their\nrepresentative models is introduced.

Specifically, if $G$ is $d$-regular, the algorithm is given\noracle access to a function $f : [d]^t\\to \\{0,1\\}$ where $f(x)$ is $1$ if the\nwalk from $u$ specified by the edge labels in $x$ ends at $v$. We assume that G\nis consistently labelled, meaning that the edges of label $i$ for each $i\\in\n[d]$ form a permutation on $V$.\nWe show that there exists a deterministic algorithm that makes\n$\\text{poly}(dt/\\varepsilon)$ nonadaptive queries to $f$, regardless of the\nnumber of vertices in the graph $G$. Crucially, and in contrast to the\nrandomized algorithm, our algorithm does not simply output the average value of\nits queries.

In this\npaper, we present {OpenPrompt}, a unified easy-to-use toolkit to conduct\nprompt-learning over PLMs. OpenPrompt is a research-friendly framework that is\nequipped with efficiency, modularity, and extendibility, and its combinability\nallows the freedom to combine different PLMs, task formats, and prompting\nmodules in a unified paradigm. Users could expediently deploy prompt-learning\nframeworks and evaluate the generalization of them on different NLP tasks\nwithout constraints. OpenPrompt is publicly released at {\\url{\nhttps://github.com/thunlp/OpenPrompt}}.",

    "abstract": "Energy storage provides an effective way of shifting temporal energy demands\nand supplies, which enables significant cost reduction under time-of-use energy\npricing plans. Despite its promising benefits, the cost of present energy\nstorage remains expensive, presenting a major obstacle to practical deployment.\nA more viable solution to improve the cost-effectiveness is by sharing energy\nstorage, such as community sharing, cloud energy storage and peer-to-peer\nsharing. However, revealing private energy demand data to an external energy\nstorage operator may compromise user privacy, and is susceptible to data\nmisuses and breaches. In this paper, we explore a novel approach to support\nenergy storage sharing with privacy protection, based on privacy-preserving\nblockchain and secure multi-party computation. We present an integrated\nsolution to enable privacy-preserving energy storage sharing, such that energy\nstorage service scheduling and cost-sharing can be attained without the\nknowledge of individual users' demands. It also supports auditing and\nverification by the grid operator via blockchain. Furthermore, our\nprivacy-preserving solution can safeguard against a dishonest majority of\nusers, who may collude in cheating, without requiring a trusted third-party. We\nimplemented our solution as a smart contract on real-world Ethereum blockchain\nplatform, and provide empirical evaluation in this paper.",

    "abstract": "An ensemble of decision trees is known as Random Forest. As suggested by\nBreiman, the strength of unstable learners and the diversity among them are the\nensemble models' core strength. In this paper, we propose two approaches for\ngenerating ensembles of double random forest. In the first approach, we propose\na rotation based ensemble of double random forest. In rotation based double\nrandom forests, transformation or rotation of the feature space is generated at\neach node. At each node different random feature subspace is chosen for\nevaluation, hence the transformation at each node is different. Different\ntransformations result in better diversity among the base learners and hence,\nbetter generalization performance. With the double random forest as base\nlearner, the data at each node is transformed via two different transformations\nnamely, principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis. In the\nsecond approach, we propose oblique ensembles of double random forest. Decision\ntrees in random forest and double random forest are univariate, and this\nresults in the generation of axis parallel split which fails to capture the\ngeometric structure of the data. Also, the standard random forest may not grow\nsufficiently large decision trees resulting in suboptimal performance. To\ncapture the geometric properties and to grow the decision trees of sufficient\ndepth, we propose oblique ensembles of double random forest. The oblique\nensembles of double random forest models are multivariate decision trees. At\neach non-leaf node, multisurface proximal support vector machine generates the\noptimal plane for better generalization performance. Also, different\nregularization techniques (Tikhonov regularisation and axis-parallel split\nregularisation) are employed for tackling the small sample size problems in the\ndecision trees of oblique ensembles of double random forest.",

Also, MGNet is inherently more interpretable as it explicitly\ninforms us where it focuses during each iteration.

Gomory\nand Hu showed that it can be computed using $n-1$ exact maxflow computations.\nSurprisingly, this remains the best algorithm for Gomory-Hu trees more than 50\nyears later, *even for approximate mincuts*. In this paper, we break this\nlongstanding barrier and give an algorithm for computing a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate Gomory-Hu tree using $\\text{polylog}(n)$ maxflow\ncomputations. Specifically, we obtain the runtime bounds we describe below.\nWe obtain a randomized (Monte Carlo) algorithm for undirected, weighted\ngraphs that runs in $\\tilde O(m + n^{3/2})$ time and returns a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate Gomory-Hu tree algorithm w.h.p. Previously, the best\nrunning time known was $\\tilde O(n^{5/2})$, which is obtained by running Gomory\nand Hu's original algorithm on a cut sparsifier of the graph.\nNext, we obtain a randomized (Monte Carlo) algorithm for undirected,\nunweighted graphs that runs in $m^{4/3+o(1)}$ time and returns a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate Gomory-Hu tree algorithm w.h.p.

Previously, the best\nrunning time known for unweighted graphs was $\\tilde O(mn)$ for an exact\nGomory-Hu tree (Bhalgat et al., STOC 2007); no better result was known if\napproximations are allowed.\nAs a consequence of our Gomory-Hu tree algorithms, we also solve the\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate all pairs mincut and single source mincut problems\nin the same time bounds. (These problems are simpler in that the goal is to\nonly return the $(s,t)$ mincut values, and not the mincuts.)

For illustration purposes, the paper uses power system event forecasting\n(PEF) as an example, which carefully analyzes synchrophasor patterns measured\nby the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Such a physical understanding leads to\na data-driven framework that reduces the dimensionality with physics and\nforecasts the event with high credibility. Specifically, for dimensionality\nreduction, machine learning arranges physical information from different\ndimensions, resulting inefficient information extraction. For event\nforecasting, the supervised learning model fuses the results of different\nmodels to increase the confidence. Finally, comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate the high accuracy, efficiency, and reliability as compared to other\nstate-of-the-art machine learning methods.",

    "abstract": "Reorganizing implicit feedback of users as a user-item interaction graph\nfacilitates the applications of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in\nrecommendation tasks. In the interaction graph, edges between user and item\nnodes function as the main element of GCNs to perform information propagation\nand generate informative representations. Nevertheless, an underlying challenge\nlies in the quality of interaction graph, since observed interactions with\nless-interested items occur in implicit feedback (say, a user views\nmicro-videos accidentally). This means that the neighborhoods involved with\nsuch false-positive edges will be influenced negatively and the signal on user\npreference can be severely contaminated. However, existing GCN-based\nrecommender models leave such challenge under-explored, resulting in suboptimal\nrepresentations and performance. In this work, we focus on adaptively refining\nthe structure of interaction graph to discover and prune potential\nfalse-positive edges. Towards this end, we devise a new GCN-based recommender\nmodel, \\emph{Graph-Refined Convolutional Network} (GRCN), which adjusts the\nstructure of interaction graph adaptively based on status of model training,\ninstead of remaining the fixed structure. In particular, a graph refining layer\nis designed to identify the noisy edges with the high confidence of being\nfalse-positive interactions, and consequently prune them in a soft manner. We\nthen apply a graph convolutional layer on the refined graph to distill\ninformative signals on user preference. Through extensive experiments on three\ndatasets for micro-video recommendation, we validate the rationality and\neffectiveness of our GRCN. Further in-depth analysis presents how the refined\ngraph benefits the GCN-based recommender model.",

    "title": "Can We Achieve Fairness Using Semi-Supervised Learning?",
    "abstract": "Ethical bias in machine learning models has become a matter of concern in the\nsoftware engineering community. Most of the prior software engineering works\nconcentrated on finding ethical bias in models rather than fixing it. After\nfinding bias, the next step is mitigation. Prior researchers mainly tried to\nuse supervised approaches to achieve fairness. However, in the real world,\ngetting data with trustworthy ground truth is challenging and also ground truth\ncan contain human bias. Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning\ntechnique where, incrementally, labeled data is used to generate pseudo-labels\nfor the rest of data (and then all that data is used for model training). In\nthis work, we apply four popular semi-supervised techniques as pseudo-labelers\nto create fair classification models. Our framework, Fair-SSL, takes a very\nsmall amount (10\\%) of labeled data as input and generates pseudo-labels for\nthe unlabeled data. We then synthetically generate new data points to balance\nthe training data based on class and protected attribute as proposed by\nChakraborty et al. in FSE 2021. Finally, the classification model is trained on\nthe balanced pseudo-labeled data and validated on test data. After\nexperimenting on ten datasets and three learners, we find that Fair-SSL\nachieves similar performance as three state-of-the-art bias mitigation\nalgorithms. That said, the clear advantage of Fair-SSL is that it requires only\n10\\% of the labeled training data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst SE work where semi-supervised techniques are used to fight against\nethical bias in SE ML models.",

    "abstract": "Automatic spoken instruction understanding (SIU) of the controller-pilot\nconversations in the air traffic control (ATC) requires not only recognizing\nthe words and semantics of the speech but also determining the role of the\nspeaker. However, few of the published works on the automatic understanding\nsystems in air traffic communication focus on speaker role identification\n(SRI). In this paper, we formulate the SRI task of controller-pilot\ncommunication as a binary classification problem. Furthermore, the text-based,\nspeech-based, and speech and text based multi-modal methods are proposed to\nachieve a comprehensive comparison of the SRI task. To ablate the impacts of\nthe comparative approaches, various advanced neural network architectures are\napplied to optimize the implementation of text-based and speech-based methods.\nMost importantly, a multi-modal speaker role identification network (MMSRINet)\nis designed to achieve the SRI task by considering both the speech and textual\nmodality features. To aggregate modality features, the modal fusion module is\nproposed to fuse and squeeze acoustic and textual representations by modal\nattention mechanism and self-attention pooling layer, respectively. Finally,\nthe comparative approaches are validated on the ATCSpeech corpus collected from\na real-world ATC environment. The experimental results demonstrate that all the\ncomparative approaches are worked for the SRI task, and the proposed MMSRINet\nshows the competitive performance and robustness than the other methods on both\nseen and unseen data, achieving 98.56%, and 98.08% accuracy, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Attentional blink (AB) is a biological effect, showing that for 200 to 500ms\nafter paying attention to one visual target, it is difficult to notice another\ntarget that appears next, and attentional blink magnitude (ABM) is a indicating\nparameter to measure the degree of this effect. Researchers have shown that\ndifferent categories of images can access the consciousness of human mind\ndifferently, and produce different ranges of ABM values. So in this paper, we\ncompare two different types of images, categorized as animal and object, by\npredicting ABM values directly from image features extracted from convolutional\nneural network (CNN), and indirectly from functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI) data. First, for two sets of images, we separately extract their average\nfeatures from layers of Alexnet, a classic model of CNN, then input the\nfeatures into a trained linear regression model to predict ABM values, and we\nfind higher-level instead of lower-level image features determine the\ncategorical difference in AB effect, and mid-level image features predict ABM\nvalues more correctly than low-level and high-level image features. Then we\nemploy fMRI data from different brain regions collected when the subjects\nviewed 50 test images to predict ABM values, and conclude that brain regions\ncovering relatively broader areas, like LVC, HVC and VC, perform better than\nother smaller brain regions, which means AB effect is more related to synthetic\nimpact of several visual brain regions than only one particular visual regions.",

In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm of point set\nresampling for restoration, which learns continuous gradient fields of point\nclouds that converge points towards the underlying surface. In particular, we\nrepresent a point cloud via its gradient field -- the gradient of the\nlog-probability density function, and enforce the gradient field to be\ncontinuous, thus guaranteeing the continuity of the model for solvable\noptimization. Based on the continuous gradient fields estimated via a proposed\nneural network, resampling a point cloud amounts to performing gradient-based\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) on the input noisy or sparse point cloud.\nFurther, we propose to introduce regularization into the gradient-based MCMC\nduring point cloud restoration, which essentially refines the intermediate\nresampled point cloud iteratively and accommodates various priors in the\nresampling process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed point set resampling achieves the state-of-the-art performance in\nrepresentative restoration tasks including point cloud denoising and\nupsampling.",

However, the problems\nof strong couplings, nonlinear characteristics and mismatched disturbances\ninevitably exist in the tiltrotor, which bring great challenges to the\ncontroller design in transition mode. In this paper, we combined a\nsuper-twisting extended state observer (STESO) with an adaptive recursive\nsliding mode control (ARSMC) together to design a tiltrotor aircraft attitude\nsystem controller in transition mode using STESO-ARSMC (SAC). Firstly, the six\ndegrees of freedom (DOF) nonlinear mathematical model of tiltrotor is\nestablished. Secondly, the states and disturbances are estimated by the STES\nobserver. Thirdly, ARSM controller is designed to achieve finite time\nconvergence. The Lyapunov function is used to testify the convergence of the\ntiltrotor UAV system. The new aspect is that the assessments of the states are\nincorporated into the control rules to adjust for disruptions. When compared to\nprior techniques, the control system proposed in this work can considerably\nenhance anti-disturbance performance.

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) tasks require the agent to learn from a\npre-collected dataset with no further interactions with the environment.\nDespite the potential to surpass the behavioral policies, RL-based methods are\ngenerally impractical due to the training instability and bootstrapping the\nextrapolation errors, which always require careful hyperparameter tuning via\nonline evaluation. In contrast, offline imitation learning (IL) has no such\nissues since it learns the policy directly without estimating the value\nfunction by bootstrapping. However, IL is usually limited in the capability of\nthe behavioral policy and tends to learn a mediocre behavior from the dataset\ncollected by the mixture of policies. In this paper, we aim to take advantage\nof IL but mitigate such a drawback. Observing that behavior cloning is able to\nimitate neighboring policies with less data, we propose \\textit{Curriculum\nOffline Imitation Learning (COIL)}, which utilizes an experience picking\nstrategy for imitating from adaptive neighboring policies with a higher return,\nand improves the current policy along curriculum stages. On continuous control\nbenchmarks, we compare COIL against both imitation-based and RL-based methods,\nshowing that it not only avoids just learning a mediocre behavior on mixed\ndatasets but is also even competitive with state-of-the-art offline RL methods.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied\nsuccessfully in many fields. However, such deep neural models are still\nregarded as black box in most tasks. One of the fundamental issues underlying\nthis problem is understanding which features are most influential in image\nrecognition tasks and how they are processed by CNNs. It is widely accepted\nthat CNN models combine low-level features to form complex shapes until the\nobject can be readily classified, however, several recent studies have argued\nthat texture features are more important than other features. In this paper, we\nassume that the importance of certain features varies depending on specific\ntasks, i.e., specific tasks exhibit a feature bias. We designed two\nclassification tasks based on human intuition to train deep neural models to\nidentify anticipated biases. We devised experiments comprising many tasks to\ntest these biases for the ResNet and DenseNet models. From the results, we\nconclude that (1) the combined effect of certain features is typically far more\ninfluential than any single feature; (2) in different tasks, neural models can\nperform different biases, that is, we can design a specific task to make a\nneural model biased toward a specific anticipated feature.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a novel multivariate temporal point process, the Partial\nMean Behavior Poisson (PMBP) process, which can be leveraged to fit the\nmultivariate Hawkes process to partially interval-censored data consisting of a\nmix of event timestamps on a subset of dimensions and interval-censored event\ncounts on the complementary dimensions. First, we define the PMBP process via\nits conditional intensity and derive the regularity conditions for\nsubcriticality. We show that both the Hawkes process and the MBP process\n(Rizoiu et al. (2021)) are special cases of the PMBP process. Second, we\nprovide numerical schemes that enable calculating the conditional intensity and\nsampling event histories of the PMBP process. Third, we demonstrate the\napplicability of the PMBP process by empirical testing using synthetic and\nreal-world datasets: We test the capability of the PMBP process to recover\nmultivariate Hawkes parameters given sample event histories of the Hawkes\nprocess. Next, we evaluate the PMBP process on the Youtube popularity\nprediction task and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art\nHawkes Intensity process (Rizoiu et al. (2017b)). Lastly, on a curated dataset\nof COVID19 daily case counts and COVID19-related news articles for a sample of\ncountries, we show that clustering on the PMBP-fitted parameters enables a\ncategorization of countries with respect to the country-level interaction of\ncases and news reporting.",

    "abstract": "This chapter aims to aid the development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in\nautomated understanding of events and activities in various applications of\nvideo-surveillance. These events are mostly captured by drones, CCTVs or novice\nand unskilled individuals on low-end devices. Being unconstrained, these videos\nare immensely challenging due to a number of quality factors. We present an\nextensive account of the various approaches taken to solve the problem over the\nyears. This ranges from methods as early as Structure from Motion (SFM) based\napproaches to recent solution frameworks involving deep neural networks. We\nshow that the long-term motion patterns alone play a pivotal role in the task\nof recognizing an event. Consequently each video is significantly represented\nby a fixed number of key-frames using a graph-based approach. Only the temporal\nfeatures are exploited using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) +\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture. The results we obtain are\nencouraging as they outperform standard temporal CNNs and are at par with those\nusing spatial information along with motion cues. Further exploring multistream\nmodels, we conceive a multi-tier fusion strategy for the spatial and temporal\nwings of a network. A consolidated representation of the respective individual\nprediction vectors on video and frame levels is obtained using a biased\nconflation technique. The fusion strategy endows us with greater rise in\nprecision on each stage as compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and thus a\npowerful consensus is achieved in classification. Results are recorded on four\nbenchmark datasets widely used in the domain of action recognition, namely CCV,\nHMDB, UCF-101 and KCV. It is inferable that focusing on better classification\nof the video sequences certainly leads to robust actuation of a system designed\nfor event surveillance and object cum activity tracking.",

In this paper, we\nhandle the critical issue of domain shift problem, i.e., confusion between seen\nand unseen categories, by progressively improving cross-domain transferability\nand category discriminability of visual representations. Our approach, named\nDual Progressive Prototype Network (DPPN), constructs two types of prototypes\nthat record prototypical visual patterns for attributes and categories,\nrespectively. With attribute prototypes, DPPN alternately searches\nattribute-related local regions and updates corresponding attribute prototypes\nto progressively explore accurate attribute-region correspondence. This enables\nDPPN to produce visual representations with accurate attribute localization\nability, which benefits the semantic-visual alignment and representation\ntransferability. Besides, along with progressive attribute localization, DPPN\nfurther projects category prototypes into multiple spaces to progressively\nrepel visual representations from different categories, which boosts category\ndiscriminability. Both attribute and category prototypes are collaboratively\nlearned in a unified framework, which makes visual representations of DPPN\ntransferable and distinctive. Experiments on four benchmarks prove that DPPN\neffectively alleviates the domain shift problem in GZSL.",

    "title": "An Explanation of In-context Learning as Implicit Bayesian Inference",
    "abstract": "Large pretrained language models such as GPT-3 have the surprising ability to\ndo in-context learning, where the model learns to do a downstream task simply\nby conditioning on a prompt consisting of input-output examples. Without being\nexplicitly pretrained to do so, the language model learns from these examples\nduring its forward pass without parameter updates on \"out-of-distribution\"\nprompts. Thus, it is unclear what mechanism enables in-context learning. In\nthis paper, we study the role of the pretraining distribution on the emergence\nof in-context learning under a mathematical setting where the pretraining texts\nhave long-range coherence. Here, language model pretraining requires inferring\na latent document-level concept from the conditioning text to generate coherent\nnext tokens. At test time, this mechanism enables in-context learning by\ninferring the shared latent concept between prompt examples and applying it to\nmake a prediction on the test example. Concretely, we prove that in-context\nlearning occurs implicitly via Bayesian inference of the latent concept when\nthe pretraining distribution is a mixture of HMMs. This can occur despite the\ndistribution mismatch between prompts and pretraining data. In contrast to\nmessy large-scale pretraining datasets for in-context learning in natural\nlanguage, we generate a family of small-scale synthetic datasets (GINC) where\nTransformer and LSTM language models both exhibit in-context learning. Beyond\nthe theory which focuses on the effect of the pretraining distribution, we\nempirically find that scaling model size improves in-context accuracy even when\nthe pretraining loss is the same.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the two common limitations on current distributed extended\nobject tracking systems, i.e., the extent is modeled as an ellipse, and each\nsensor node in network needs to detect the object, this paper considers a\nmultiplicative error model (MEM) to design a distributed information filter\n(IF) over a realistic network. The MEM reduces the extent of perpendicular\naxis-symmetric shapes into a 3-D vector, which results in MEM being a nonlinear\nand state-coupled model with multiplicative noise. To meet the requirement in\nIF that the state-space model is a linear model with additive noise, we first\nderive two separate pseudo-linearized models by using the first-order Taylor\nseries expansion. The separation is merely in form, and the cross-correlation\nbetween two estimated states is preserved as parameters in each other's model.\nThus, the joint estimation is transferred into an iterative operation of two\nlinear filters. Second, we propose a centralized information filter by using\nthe two models, in which the multiple measurements are converted into a\nsummation form of innovation parts. Third, under a sensor network where the\ncommunication nodes cannot detect the object, we present two distributed\ninformation filters based on the consensus on information (CI) and consensus on\nmeasurement (CM) schemes, respectively. Finally, the performance of two\ndistributed filters in terms of accuracy, convergence, and consistency is\nevaluated in Monte Carlo simulations.",

Many application problems require\nthe consideration of matrices of size three with spectral decomposition over\nthe real numbers.

Existing closed-form expressions are based on the use of\nprincipal matrix invariants which suffer from a number of deficiencies when\nevaluated in the framework of finite precision arithmetic. This paper\nintroduces an alternative form for the computation of the involved matrix\ninvariants (in particular the discriminant) in terms of sum-of-products\nexpressions as function of the matrix elements.

It is believed that the combination of symbolic algorithms with\nthe accuracy improvements presented in this paper can serve as a powerful\nbuilding block for many engineering tasks.",

    "abstract": "Flying vertebrates exhibit sophisticated wingbeat kinematics. Their\nspecialized forelimbs allow for the wing morphing motion to couple with the\nflapping motion during their level flight, Previous flyable bionic platforms\nhave successfully applied bio-inspired wing morphing but cannot yet be\npropelled by the morphing-coupled wingbeat pattern. Spurred by this, we develop\na bio-inspired flapping-wing aerial vehicle (FWAV) entitled RoboFalcon, which\nis equipped with a novel mechanism to drive the bat-style morphing wings,\nperforms a morphing-coupled wingbeat pattern, and overall manages an appealing\nflight. The novel mechanism of RoboFalcon allows coupling the morphing and\nflapping during level flight and decoupling these when maneuvering is required,\nproducing a bilateral asymmetric downstroke affording high rolling agility. The\nbat-style morphing wing is designed with a tilted mounting angle around the\nradius at the wrist joint to mimic the wrist supination and pronation effect of\nflying vertebrates' forelimbs. The agility of RoboFalcon is assessed through\nseveral rolling maneuver flight tests, and we demonstrate its well-performing\nagility capability compared to flying creatures and current flapping-wing\nplatforms. Wind tunnel tests indicate that the roll moment of the asymmetric\ndownstroke is correlated with the flapping frequency, and the wrist mounting\nangle can be used for tuning the angle of attack and lift-thrust configuration\nof the equilibrium flight state. We believe that this work yields a\nwell-performing bionic platform and provides a new actuation strategy for the\nmorphing-coupled flapping flight.",

Tuning these rules becomes\nparticularly cumbersome when scaling-up a cluster involves non-negligible times\nto bootstrap new instances, as it happens frequently in production cloud\nservices.\nTo deal with this problem, we propose an architecture for auto-scaling cloud\nservices based on the status in which the system is expected to evolve in the\nnear future. Our approach leverages on time-series forecasting techniques, like\nthose based on machine learning and artificial neural networks, to predict the\nfuture dynamics of key metrics, e.g., resource consumption metrics, and apply a\nthreshold-based scaling policy on them. The result is a predictive automation\npolicy that is able, for instance, to automatically anticipate peaks in the\nload of a cloud application and trigger ahead of time appropriate scaling\nactions to accommodate the expected increase in traffic.\nWe prototyped our approach as an open-source OpenStack component, which\nrelies on, and extends, the monitoring capabilities offered by Monasca,\nresulting in the addition of predictive metrics that can be leveraged by\norchestration components like Heat or Senlin. We show experimental results\nusing a recurrent neural network and a multi-layer perceptron as predictor,\nwhich are compared with a simple linear regression and a traditional\nnon-predictive auto-scaling policy.

The\nPyramid, Warping, and Cost volume (PWC) structure for the LiDAR odometry task\nis built to estimate and refine the pose in a coarse-to-fine approach\nhierarchically and efficiently.

The entire architecture is holistically optimized end-to-end to\nachieve adaptive learning of cost volume and mask, and all operations involving\npoint cloud sampling and grouping are accelerated by projection-aware 3D\nfeature learning methods.

In particular, we show\nthat if a subpolynomial amount of nondeterministic guessing could be used to\nspeed up deterministic computation by a polynomial factor, then P is strictly\ncontained in NTIME(n). Furthermore, even achieving a logarithmic speedup at the\ncost of making every step nondeterministic would show that SAT is in NTIME(n)\nunder appropriate encodings. Of possibly independent interest, under such\nencodings we also show that SAT can be decided in O(n lg n) steps on a\nnondeterministic multitape Turing machine, improving on the well-known O(n(lg\nn)^c) bound for some constant but undetermined exponent c which is at least 1.",

    "abstract": "Source camera identification tools assist image forensic investigators to\nassociate an image in question with a suspect camera. Various techniques have\nbeen developed based on the analysis of the subtle traces left in the images\nduring the acquisition. The Photo Response Non Uniformity (PRNU) noise pattern\ncaused by sensor imperfections has been proven to be an effective way to\nidentify the source camera. The existing literature suggests that the PRNU is\nthe only fingerprint that is device-specific and capable of identifying the\nexact source device. However, the PRNU is susceptible to camera settings, image\ncontent, image processing operations, and counter-forensic attacks. A forensic\ninvestigator unaware of counter-forensic attacks or incidental image\nmanipulations is at the risk of getting misled. The spatial synchronization\nrequirement during the matching of two PRNUs also represents a major limitation\nof the PRNU. In recent years, deep learning based approaches have been\nsuccessful in identifying source camera models. However, the identification of\nindividual cameras of the same model through these data-driven approaches\nremains unsatisfactory. In this paper, we bring to light the existence of a new\nrobust data-driven device-specific fingerprint in digital images which is\ncapable of identifying the individual cameras of the same model. It is\ndiscovered that the new device fingerprint is location-independent, stochastic,\nand globally available, which resolve the spatial synchronization issue. Unlike\nthe PRNU, which resides in the high-frequency band, the new device fingerprint\nis extracted from the low and mid-frequency bands, which resolves the fragility\nissue that the PRNU is unable to contend with. Our experiments on various\ndatasets demonstrate that the new fingerprint is highly resilient to image\nmanipulations such as rotation, gamma correction, and aggressive JPEG\ncompression.",

We tackle this by designing a high-fidelity simulation\nenvironment, which abstracts the key operation details of the shared e-mobility\nsystems at fine-granularity, and is calibrated using data collected from the\nreal-world. This allows us to try out arbitrary deployment plans to learn the\noptimal given specific context, before actually implementing any in the\nreal-world systems. In particular, we propose a novel multi-agent neural search\napproach, in which we design a hierarchical controller to produce tentative\ndeployment plans. The generated deployment plans are then tested using a\nmulti-simulation paradigm, i.e., evaluated in parallel, where the results are\nused to train the controller with deep reinforcement learning. With this closed\nloop, the controller can be steered to have higher probability of generating\nbetter deployment plans in future iterations.

    "abstract": "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the most popular classification\nmethods, and a de-facto reference for many Machine Learning approaches. Its\nperformance is determined by parameter selection, which is usually achieved by\na time-consuming grid search cross-validation procedure. There exist, however,\nseveral unsupervised heuristics that take advantage of the characteristics of\nthe dataset for selecting parameters instead of using class label information.\nUnsupervised heuristics, while an order of magnitude faster, are scarcely used\nunder the assumption that their results are significantly worse than those of\ngrid search. To challenge that assumption we have conducted a wide study of\nvarious heuristics for SVM parameter selection on over thirty datasets, in both\nsupervised and semi-supervised scenarios. In most cases, the cross-validation\ngrid search did not achieve a significant advantage over the heuristics. In\nparticular, heuristical parameter selection may be preferable for high\ndimensional and unbalanced datasets or when a small number of examples is\navailable. Our results also show that using a heuristic to determine the\nstarting point of further cross-validation does not yield significantly better\nresults than the default start.",

    "abstract": "In order to safely and efficiently collaborate with humans, industrial robots\nneed the ability to alter their motions quickly to react to sudden changes in\nthe environment, such as an obstacle appearing across a planned trajectory. In\nRealtime Motion Planning, obstacles are detected in real time through a vision\nsystem, and new trajectories are planned with respect to the current positions\nof the obstacles, and immediately executed on the robot. Existing realtime\nmotion planners, however, lack the smoothing post-processing step -- which are\ncrucial in sampling-based motion planning -- resulting in the planned\ntrajectories being jerky, and therefore inefficient and less human-friendly.\nHere we propose a Realtime Trajectory Smoother based on the shortcutting\ntechnique to address this issue. Leveraging fast clearance inference by a novel\nneural network, the proposed method is able to consistently smooth the\ntrajectories of a 6-DOF industrial robot arm within 200 ms on a commercial GPU.\nWe integrate the proposed smoother into a full Vision--Motion\nPlanning--Execution loop and demonstrate a realtime, smooth, performance of an\nindustrial robot subject to dynamic obstacles.",

In this work, we propose a novel dual-agent framework\nthat integrates a reinforcement learning (RL) agent and a deep learning (DL)\nagent to jointly determine the movement of the US probe based on the real-time\nUS images, in order to mimic the decision-making process of an expert\nsonographer to achieve autonomous standard view acquisitions in spinal\nsonography. Moreover, inspired by the nature of US propagation and the\ncharacteristics of the spinal anatomy, we introduce a view-specific acoustic\nshadow reward to utilize the shadow information to implicitly guide the\nnavigation of the probe toward different standard views of the spine. Our\nmethod is validated in both quantitative and qualitative experiments in a\nsimulation environment built with US data acquired from $17$ volunteers.

The optimization is framed as a\nsupervised vertex regression task, where the GNN is trained to predict the\ncurrent and power injections at each grid branch that yield a power flow\nbalance. By representing the power grid as a line graph with branches as\nvertices, we can train a GNN that is more accurate and robust to changes in the\nunderlying topology. In addition, by using specialized GNN layers, we are able\nto build a very deep architecture that accounts for large neighborhoods on the\ngraph, while implementing only localized operations. We perform three different\nexperiments to evaluate: i) the benefits of using localized rather than global\noperations and the tendency to oversmooth when using deep GNN models; ii) the\nresilience to perturbations in the graph topology; and iii) the capability to\ntrain the model simultaneously on multiple grid topologies and the\nconsequential improvement in generalization to new, unseen grids. The proposed\nframework is efficient and, compared to other solvers based on deep learning,\nis robust to perturbations not only to the physical quantities on the grid\ncomponents, but also to the topology.",

    "abstract": "The audio-video based multimodal emotion recognition has attracted a lot of\nattention due to its robust performance. Most of the existing methods focus on\nproposing different cross-modal fusion strategies. However, these strategies\nintroduce redundancy in the features of different modalities without fully\nconsidering the complementary properties between modal information, and these\napproaches do not guarantee the non-loss of original semantic information\nduring intra- and inter-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel\ncross-modal fusion network based on self-attention and residual structure\n(CFN-SR) for multimodal emotion recognition. Firstly, we perform representation\nlearning for audio and video modalities to obtain the semantic features of the\ntwo modalities by efficient ResNeXt and 1D CNN, respectively. Secondly, we feed\nthe features of the two modalities into the cross-modal blocks separately to\nensure efficient complementarity and completeness of information through the\nself-attention mechanism and residual structure. Finally, we obtain the output\nof emotions by splicing the obtained fused representation with the original\nrepresentation. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct\nexperiments on the RAVDESS dataset. The experimental results show that the\nproposed CFN-SR achieves the state-of-the-art and obtains 75.76% accuracy with\n26.30M parameters.

Moreover, fulfilling the\nstochastic service requests in a large network is another challenge that is\nevaluated in this paper. To solve the formulated optimization problem in an\nefficient and intelligent manner, we propose a Deep Q-Network for Adaptive\nResource allocation (DQN-AR) in NFV-enable network for function placement and\ndynamic routing which considers the available network resources as DQN states.\nMoreover, the service's characteristics, including the service life time and\nnumber of the arrival requests, are modeled by the Uniform and Exponential\ndistribution, respectively. In addition, we evaluate the computational\ncomplexity of the proposed method. Numerical results carried out for different\nranges of parameters reveal the effectiveness of our framework. In specific,\nthe obtained results show that the average number of admitted requests of the\nnetwork increases by 7 up to 14% and the network utilization cost decreases by\n5 and 20 %.",

Four swarm intelligence algorithms - Particle\nSwarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Grey Wolf Optimization\n(GWO), and Improved Grey Wolf Optimization (I-GWO) - are described. Data-driven\ncontroller design is commented, focusing on the Virtual Reference Feedback\nTuning (VRFT) algorithms. The estimation of the $\\mathcal{H}_{\\infty}$ norm of\n$S(z)$ via impulse response is presented. Two illustrative real-world based\nexamples, regarding a Boost-like second order plant and a SEPIC-like fourth\norder plant, are tested for all commented swarm intelligence algorithms with\nthe proposed method. Each algorithm at each case was run for 50 times, with 100\nsearch agents, and maximum number of iterations limited to 100. For both\nexamples, I-GWO presented the the best desired behavior, with the least number\nof outliers and no bad outlier in terms of fitness and $||S(z)||_{\\infty}$\nnorm, as well as faster convergence, lowering the $||S(z)||_{\\infty}$ norm of\nthe plant from values greater than 2.0 to 1.8, still maintaining a low fitness\nvalue.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a surge in applying deep learning to various\nchallenging design problems in communication networks. The early attempts adopt\nneural architectures inherited from applications such as computer vision, which\nsuffer from poor generalization, scalability, and lack of interpretability. To\ntackle these issues, domain knowledge has been integrated into the neural\narchitecture design, which achieves near-optimal performance in large-scale\nnetworks and generalizes well under different system settings. This paper\nendeavors to theoretically validate the importance and effects of neural\narchitectures when applying deep learning to design communication networks. We\nprove that by exploiting permutation invariance, a common property in\ncommunication networks, graph neural networks (GNNs) converge faster and\ngeneralize better than fully connected multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs),\nespecially when the number of nodes (e.g., users, base stations, or antennas)\nis large. Specifically, we prove that under common assumptions, for a\ncommunication network with $n$ nodes, GNNs converge $O(n \\log n)$ times faster\nand their generalization error is $O(n)$ times lower, compared with MLPs.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation intelligent systems must plan and execute complex tasks with\nimperfect information about their environment. As a result, plans must also\ninclude actions to learn about the environment. This is known as active\nperception. Most active perception algorithms rely on reward or cost functions,\nwhich are usually challenging to specify and offer few theoretical guarantees.\nOn the other hand, symbolic control methods can account for complex tasks using\ntemporal logic but often do not deal well with uncertainties. This work\ncombines symbolic control with active perception to achieve complex tasks in a\npartially observed and noisy control system with hybrid dynamics. Our basic\nidea is to employ a counterexample-guided-inductive-synthesis approach for\ncontrol from probabilistic signal temporal logic (PrSTL) specifications. Our\nproposed algorithm combines bounded model checking (BMC) with sampling-based\ntrajectory synthesis for uncertain hybrid systems.

    "abstract": "Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an emerging computational framework\ninspired by the brain that operates on vectors with thousands of dimensions to\nemulate cognition. Unlike conventional computational frameworks that operate on\nnumbers, HDC, like the brain, uses high dimensional random vectors and is\ncapable of one-shot learning. HDC is based on a well-defined set of arithmetic\noperations and is highly error-resilient. The core operations of HDC manipulate\nHD vectors in bulk bit-wise fashion, offering many opportunities to leverage\nparallelism. Unfortunately, on conventional Von-Neuman architectures, the\ncontinuous movement of HD vectors among the processor and the memory can make\nthe cognition task prohibitively slow and energy-intensive. Hardware\naccelerators only marginally improve related metrics. On the contrary, only\npartial implementation of an HDC framework inside memory, using emerging\nmemristive devices, has reported considerable performance/energy gains. This\npaper presents an architecture based on racetrack memory (RTM) to conduct and\naccelerate the entire HDC framework within the memory. The proposed solution\nrequires minimal additional CMOS circuitry and uses a read operation across\nmultiple domains in RTMs called transverse read (TR) to realize exclusive-or\n(XOR) and addition operations. To minimize the overhead the CMOS circuitry, we\npropose an RTM nanowires-based counting mechanism that leverages the TR\noperation and the standard RTM operations. Using language recognition as the\nuse case demonstrates 7.8x and 5.3x reduction in the overall runtime and energy\nconsumption compared to the FPGA design, respectively. Compared to the\nstate-of-the-art in-memory implementation, the proposed HDC system reduces the\nenergy consumption by 8.6x.",

Existing approaches rely on fitting deep models on\noutcomes observed for treated and control populations. However, when measuring\nindividual outcomes is costly, as is the case of a tumor biopsy, a\nsample-efficient strategy for acquiring each result is required. Deep Bayesian\nactive learning provides a framework for efficient data acquisition by\nselecting points with high uncertainty. However, existing methods bias training\ndata acquisition towards regions of non-overlapping support between the treated\nand control populations.

There is an unmet need for a soft actuator that can provide torsional\nmotion to e.g. enlarge working space and increase degrees of freedom. Towards\nthis goal, we present origami-inspired soft pneumatic actuators (OSPAs) made\nfrom silicone. The prototype can output a rotation of more than one revolution\n(up to 435{\\deg}), larger than previous counterparts. We describe the design\nand fabrication method, build the kinematics models and simulation models, and\nanalyze and optimize the parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the potentially\nextensive utility of OSPAs through their integration into a gripper capable of\nsimultaneously grasping and lifting fragile or flat objects, a versatile robot\narm capable of picking and placing items at the right angle with the twisting\nactuators, and a soft snake robot capable of changing attitude and directions\nby torsion of the twisting actuators.",

Our main result is\nthat SGD is biased towards a simple solution: at convergence, the ReLU network\nimplements a piecewise linear map of the inputs, and the number of \"knot\"\npoints - i.e., points where the tangent of the ReLU network estimator changes -\nbetween two consecutive training inputs is at most three. In particular, as the\nnumber of neurons of the network grows, the SGD dynamics is captured by the\nsolution of a gradient flow and, at convergence, the distribution of the\nweights approaches the unique minimizer of a related free energy, which has a\nGibbs form. Our key technical contribution consists in the analysis of the\nestimator resulting from this minimizer: we show that its second derivative\nvanishes everywhere, except at some specific locations which represent the\n\"knot\" points.

The task is to\ncompute a subgraph $H$ of $G$ of minimum cost, such that there are at least\n$d_{s,t}$ disjoint paths between $s$ and $t$ in $H$. If the paths are required\nto be edge-disjoint we obtain the edge-connectivity variant (EC-SNDP), while\ninternally vertex-disjoint paths result in the vertex-connectivity variant\n(VC-SNDP). Another important case is the element-connectivity variant\n(LC-SNDP), where the paths are disjoint on edges and non-terminals.\nIn this work we shed light on the parameterized complexity of the above\nproblems. We consider several natural parameters, which include the solution\nsize $\\ell$, the sum of demands $D$, the number of terminals $k$, and the\nmaximum demand $d_\\max$. Using simple, elegant arguments, we prove the\nfollowing results.\n- We give a complete picture of the parameterized tractability of the three\nvariants w.r.t. parameter $\\ell$: both EC-SNDP and LC-SNDP are FPT, while\nVC-SNDP is W[1]-hard.\n- We identify some special cases of VC-SNDP that are FPT:\n* when $d_\\max\\leq 3$ for parameter $\\ell$,\n* on locally bounded treewidth graphs (e.g., planar graphs) for parameter\n$\\ell$, and\n* on graphs of treewidth $tw$ for parameter $tw+D$.\n- The well-known Directed Steiner Tree (DST) problem can be seen as\nsingle-source EC-SNDP with $d_\\max=1$ on directed graphs, and is FPT\nparameterized by $k$ [Dreyfus & Wagner 1971].

The former allows one to classify problems more\nfinely than the Polynomial-Time Hierarchy (PH), whereas the latter\ncharacterizes physically motivated problems such as Approximate Simulation\n(APX-SIM) [Ambainis, CCC 2014]. In this area, a central role has been played by\nthe classes $P^{NP[\\log]}$ and $P^{QMA[\\log]}$, defined identically to $P^{NP}$\nand $P^{QMA}$, except that only logarithmically many oracle queries are\nallowed. Here, [Gottlob, FOCS 1993] showed that if the adaptive queries made by\na $P^{NP}$ machine have a \"query graph\" which is a tree, then this computation\ncan be simulated in $P^{NP[\\log]}$.\nIn this work, we first show that for any verification class\n$C\\in\\{NP,MA,QCMA,QMA,QMA(2),NEXP,QMA_{\\exp}\\}$, any $P^C$ machine with a query\ngraph of \"separator number\" $s$ can be simulated using deterministic time\n$\\exp(s\\log n)$ and $s\\log n$ queries to a $C$-oracle. When $s\\in O(1)$ (which\nincludes the case of $O(1)$-treewidth, and thus also of trees), this gives an\nupper bound of $P^{C[\\log]}$, and when $s\\in O(\\log^k(n))$, this yields bound\n$QP^{C[\\log^{k+1}]}$ (QP meaning quasi-polynomial time). We next show how to\ncombine Gottlob's \"admissible-weighting function\" framework with the\n\"flag-qubit\" framework of [Watson, Bausch, Gharibian, 2020], obtaining a\nunified approach for embedding $P^C$ computations directly into APX-SIM\ninstances in a black-box fashion. Finally, we formalize a simple no-go\nstatement about polynomials (c.f.

    "abstract": "Energy-efficient navigation constitutes an important challenge in electric\nvehicles, due to their limited battery capacity. We employ a Bayesian approach\nto model the energy consumption at road segments for efficient navigation. In\norder to learn the model parameters, we develop an online learning framework\nand investigate several exploration strategies such as Thompson Sampling and\nUpper Confidence Bound. We then extend our online learning framework to\nmulti-agent setting, where multiple vehicles adaptively navigate and learn the\nparameters of the energy model. We analyze Thompson Sampling and establish\nrigorous regret bounds on its performance in the single-agent and multi-agent\nsettings, through an analysis of the algorithm under batched feedback. Finally,\nwe demonstrate the performance of our methods via experiments on several\nreal-world city road networks.",

    "title": "Improving Model Compatibility of Generative Adversarial Networks by  Boundary Calibration",
    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a powerful family of models that\nlearn an underlying distribution to generate synthetic data. Many existing\nstudies of GANs focus on improving the realness of the generated image data for\nvisual applications, and few of them concern about improving the quality of the\ngenerated data for training other classifiers -- a task known as the model\ncompatibility problem. As a consequence, existing GANs often prefer generating\n`easier' synthetic data that are far from the boundaries of the classifiers,\nand refrain from generating near-boundary data, which are known to play an\nimportant roles in training the classifiers. To improve GAN in terms of model\ncompatibility, we propose Boundary-Calibration GANs (BCGANs), which leverage\nthe boundary information from a set of pre-trained classifiers using the\noriginal data. In particular, we introduce an auxiliary Boundary-Calibration\nloss (BC-loss) into the generator of GAN to match the statistics between the\nposterior distributions of original data and generated data with respect to the\nboundaries of the pre-trained classifiers. The BC-loss is provably unbiased and\ncan be easily coupled with different GAN variants to improve their model\ncompatibility. Experimental results demonstrate that BCGANs not only generate\nrealistic images like original GANs but also achieves superior model\ncompatibility than the original GANs.",

    "abstract": "Test smells are known as bad development practices that reflect poor design\nand implementation choices in software tests. Over the last decade, test smells\nwere heavily studied to measure their prevalence and impacts on test\nmaintainability. However, these studies focused mainly on the unit level and to\nthis day, the work on system tests that interact with the System Under Test\nthrough a Graphical User Interface remains limited. To fill the gap, we conduct\nan exploratory analysis of test smells occurring in System User Interactive\nTests (SUIT). First, based on a multi-vocal literature review, we propose a\ncatalog of 35 SUIT-specific smells. Then, we conduct an empirical analysis to\nassess the prevalence and refactoring of these smells in 48 industrial test\nsuites and 12 open-source projects. We show that the same type of smells tends\nto appear in industrial and open-source projects, but the symptoms are not\naddressed in the same way. Smells such as Obscure Test, Sneaky Checking, and\nOver Checking show symptoms in more than 70% of the tests. Yet refactoring\nactions are much less frequent with less than 50% of the affected tests ever\nundergoing refactoring. Interestingly, while refactoring actions are rare, some\nsmells, such as Narcissistic, disappear through the removal of old symptomatic\ntests and the introduction of new tests not presenting such symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Given an array of distinct integers $A[1\\ldots n]$, the Range Minimum Query\n(RMQ) problem requires us to construct a data structure from $A$, supporting\nthe RMQ query: given an interval $[a,b]\\subseteq[1,n]$, return the index of the\nminimum element in subarray $A[a\\ldots b]$, i.e. return\n$\\text{argmin}_{i\\in[a,b]}A[i]$. The fundamental problem has a long history.\nThe textbook solution which uses $O(n)$ words of space and $O(1)$ time by\nGabow, Bentley, Tarjan (STOC 1984) and Harel, Tarjan (SICOMP 1984) dates back\nto 1980s. The state-of-the-art solution is presented by Fischer, Heun (SICOMP\n2011) and Navarro, Sadakane (TALG 2014). The solution uses\n$2n+n/\\left(\\frac{\\log n}{t}\\right)^t+\\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$ bits of space and\n$O(t)$ query time, assuming the word-size is $\\Theta(\\log n)$ bits.

We show\nthat, for any data structure which solves RMQ in $t$ query time, $2n+n/(\\log\nn)^{O(t\\log^2t)}$ bits of space is necessary in the cell-probe model with\nword-size $\\Theta(\\log n)$. We emphasize that, for any $r$, we present a lower\nbound of $t=\\Omega(t_{opt}/\\log^3 t_{opt})$, where $t_{opt}$ is the optimal\ntime cost when the data structure is allowed to consume $2n+r$ bits of space.\nHence our lower bound is nearly tight.",

    "abstract": "The number and diversity of consumer devices are growing rapidly, alongside\ntheir target applications' memory consumption. Unfortunately, DRAM scalability\nis becoming a limiting factor to the available memory capacity in consumer\ndevices. As a potential solution, manufacturers have introduced emerging\nnon-volatile memories (NVMs) into the market, which can be used to increase the\nmemory capacity of consumer devices by augmenting or replacing DRAM. Since\nentirely replacing DRAM with NVM in consumer devices imposes large system\nintegration and design challenges, recent works propose extending the total\nmain memory space available to applications by using NVM as swap space for\nDRAM. However, no prior work analyzes the implications of enabling a real\nNVM-based swap space in real consumer devices.\nIn this work, we provide the first analysis of the impact of extending the\nmain memory space of consumer devices using off-the-shelf NVMs. We extensively\nexamine system performance and energy consumption when the NVM device is used\nas swap space for DRAM main memory to effectively extend the main memory\ncapacity.

This allows for novel\napproaches to interaction with the vehicle that go beyond traditional\ntouch-based and voice command approaches, such as emotion recognition, head\nrotation, eye gaze, and pointing gestures. Although gaze and pointing gestures\nhave been used before for referencing objects inside and outside vehicles, the\nmultimodal interaction and fusion of these gestures have so far not been\nextensively studied. We propose a novel learning-based multimodal fusion\napproach for referencing outside-the-vehicle objects while maintaining a long\ndriving route in a simulated environment.

We derive an analytic distribution of shortest path lengths, on the\ngiant component in the supercritical regime or on small components in the\nsubcritical regime, of any sparse (possibly directed) graph with conditionally\nindependent edges, in the infinite-size limit. We provide specific results for\nwidely used network families like stochastic block models, dot-product graphs,\nrandom geometric graphs, and graphons. The survival function of the shortest\npath length distribution possesses a simple closed-form lower bound which is\nasymptotically tight for finite lengths, has a natural interpretation of\ntraversing independent geodesics in the network, and delivers novel insight in\nthe above network families. Notably, the shortest path length distribution\nallows us to derive, for the network families above, important graph properties\nlike the bond percolation threshold, size of the giant component, average\nshortest path length, and closeness and betweenness centralities.

    "title": "Smooth Imitation Learning via Smooth Costs and Smooth Policies",
    "abstract": "Imitation learning (IL) is a popular approach in the continuous control\nsetting as among other reasons it circumvents the problems of reward\nmis-specification and exploration in reinforcement learning (RL). In IL from\ndemonstrations, an important challenge is to obtain agent policies that are\nsmooth with respect to the inputs. Learning through imitation a policy that is\nsmooth as a function of a large state-action ($s$-$a$) space (typical of high\ndimensional continuous control environments) can be challenging. We take a\nfirst step towards tackling this issue by using smoothness inducing\nregularizers on \\textit{both} the policy and the cost models of adversarial\nimitation learning. Our regularizers work by ensuring that the cost function\nchanges in a controlled manner as a function of $s$-$a$ space; and the agent\npolicy is well behaved with respect to the state space. We call our new smooth\nIL algorithm \\textit{Smooth Policy and Cost Imitation Learning} (SPaCIL,\npronounced 'Special'). We introduce a novel metric to quantify the smoothness\nof the learned policies. We demonstrate SPaCIL's superior performance on\ncontinuous control tasks from MuJoCo. The algorithm not just outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art IL algorithm on our proposed smoothness metric, but, enjoys\nadded benefits of faster learning and substantially higher average return.",

    "abstract": "Covariate shift generalization, a typical case in out-of-distribution (OOD)\ngeneralization, requires a good performance on the unknown testing\ndistribution, which varies from the accessible training distribution in the\nform of covariate shift. Recently, stable learning algorithms have shown\nempirical effectiveness to deal with covariate shift generalization on several\nlearning models involving regression algorithms and deep neural networks.\nHowever, the theoretical explanations for such effectiveness are still missing.\nIn this paper, we take a step further towards the theoretical analysis of\nstable learning algorithms by explaining them as feature selection processes.\nWe first specify a set of variables, named minimal stable variable set, that is\nminimal and optimal to deal with covariate shift generalization for common loss\nfunctions, including the mean squared loss and binary cross entropy loss. Then\nwe prove that under ideal conditions, stable learning algorithms could identify\nthe variables in this set. Further analysis on asymptotic properties and error\npropagation are also provided. These theories shed light on why stable learning\nworks for covariate shift generalization.",

This is remarkable since it demonstrates that the proposed\nDAEs have significant potential to exceed the limits of current system design\nby treating the communication system as a single, end-to-end optimization\nblock. Based on the simulation results, at SNR=10dB, the proposed SVD-embedded\ndesign can achieve BER nearly $10^{-5}$ and reduce the BER at least 10 times\ncompared with existing DAE without SVD, and up to 18 times improvement compared\nwith theoretical linear precoding. We attribute this to the fact that the\nproposed DAE can match the input and output as an adaptive modulation structure\nwith finite alphabet input.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Vehicles (IoV), whereby interconnected vehicles communicate\nwith each other and with road infrastructure on a common network, has promising\nsocio-economic benefits but also poses new cyber-physical threats. Data on\nvehicular attackers can be realistically gathered through cyber threat\nintelligence using systems like honeypots. Admittedly, configuring honeypots\nintroduces a trade-off between the level of honeypot-attacker interactions and\nany incurred overheads and costs for implementing and monitoring these\nhoneypots. We argue that effective deception can be achieved through\nstrategically configuring the honeypots to represent components of the IoV and\nengage attackers to collect cyber threat intelligence. In this paper, we\npresent HoneyCar, a novel decision support framework for honeypot deception in\nIoV. HoneyCar builds upon a repository of known vulnerabilities of the\nautonomous and connected vehicles found in the Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposure (CVE) data within the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to compute\noptimal honeypot configuration strategies. By taking a game-theoretic approach,\nwe model the adversarial interaction as a repeated imperfect-information\nzero-sum game in which the IoV network administrator chooses a set of\nvulnerabilities to offer in a honeypot and a strategic attacker chooses a\nvulnerability of the IoV to exploit under uncertainty. Our investigation is\nsubstantiated by examining two different versions of the game, with and without\nthe re-configuration cost to empower the network administrator to determine\noptimal honeypot configurations. We evaluate HoneyCar in a realistic use case\nto support decision makers with determining optimal honeypot configuration\nstrategies for strategic deployment in IoV.",

    "abstract": "We propose an accurate and efficient scene text detection framework, termed\nFAST (i.e., faster arbitrarily-shaped text detector). Different from recent\nadvanced text detectors that used hand-crafted network architectures and\ncomplicated post-processing, resulting in low inference speed, FAST has two new\ndesigns. (1) We search the network architecture by designing a network search\nspace and reward function carefully tailored for text detection, leading to\nmore powerful features than most networks that are searched for image\nclassification. (2) We design a minimalist representation (only has 1-channel\noutput) to model text with arbitrary shape, as well as a GPU-parallel\npost-processing to efficiently assemble text lines with negligible time\noverhead. Benefiting from these two designs, FAST achieves an excellent\ntrade-off between accuracy and efficiency on several challenging datasets. For\nexample, FAST-A0 yields 81.4% F-measure at 152 FPS on Total-Text, outperforming\nthe previous fastest method by 1.5 points and 70 FPS in terms of accuracy and\nspeed. With TensorRT optimization, the inference speed can be further\naccelerated to over 600 FPS.",

    "title": "Spatial regionalization as optimal data compression",
    "abstract": "The process of aggregating areal units into contiguous clusters, known as\nregionalization, is central to the analysis of spatial data. Regionalization\nprovides a means to reduce the effect of noise or outliers in sampled data,\nidentify socioeconomically homogeneous areas for policy development, and\nsimplify the visualization of data in maps among many other applications. Most\nexisting regionalization methods require a substantial amount of manual input,\nsuch as the number of desired regions or a similarity measure among regional\npopulations, which may be desirable for some applications but does not allow us\nto extract the natural regions defined solely by the data itself. Here we view\nthe problem of regionalization as one of data compression. We define the\noptimal partition of spatial units with corresponding distributional data as\nthe one that minimizes the description length required to transmit the data,\nand develop an efficient, parameter-free greedy optimization algorithm to\nidentify this partition. We demonstrate that our method is capable of\nrecovering planted spatial clusters in noisy synthetic distributional data, and\nthat it identifies meaningful ethnoracial boundaries in real demographic data.\nUsing our description length formulation, we find that the information\ncontained in spatial ethnoracial data in metropolitan areas across the U.S. has\nbecome more difficult to compress over the period from 1980 to 2010, which\nreflects the rising complexity of urban segregation patterns of these metros.\nWe identify the increasing overall diversity of these metros as a major\ncontributor to this lower data compressibility, while the spatial scale of\nethnoracial clustering does not appear to be a significant factor.",

By reformulating GLP as an equivalent convex-concave\nmin-max problem, we show that the linear structure in the problem can be used\nto design an efficient, scalable first-order algorithm, to which we give the\nname \\emph{Coordinate Linear Variance Reduction} (\\textsc{clvr}; pronounced\n``clever''). \\textsc{clvr} is an incremental coordinate method with implicit\nvariance reduction that outputs an \\emph{affine combination} of the dual\nvariable iterates. \\textsc{clvr} yields improved complexity results for (GLP)\nthat depend on the max row norm of the linear constraint matrix in (GLP) rather\nthan the spectral norm.

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose an over-the-air computation (AirComp) scheme for\nfederated edge learning (FEEL). The proposed scheme relies on the concept of\ndistributed learning by majority vote (MV) with sign stochastic gradient\ndescend (signSGD). As compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, with the\nproposed method, edge devices (EDs) transmit the signs of local stochastic\ngradients by activating one of two orthogonal resources, i.e., orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers, and the MVs at the edge\nserver (ES) are obtained with non-coherent detectors by exploiting the energy\naccumulations on the subcarriers. Hence, the proposed scheme eliminates the\nneed for channel state information (CSI) at the EDs and ES. By taking path\nloss, power control, cell size, and the probabilistic nature of the detected\nMVs in fading channel into account, we prove the convergence of the distributed\nlearning for a non-convex function. Through simulations, we show that the\nproposed scheme can provide a high test accuracy in fading channels even when\nthe time-synchronization and the power alignment at the ES are not ideal. We\nalso provide insight into distributed learning for location-dependent data\ndistribution for the MV-based schemes.",

    "abstract": "Training computer-vision related algorithms on medical images for disease\ndiagnosis or image segmentation is difficult due to the lack of training data,\nlabeled samples, and privacy concerns. For this reason, a robust generative\nmethod to create synthetic data is highly sought after. However, most\nthree-dimensional image generators require additional image input or are\nextremely memory intensive. To address these issues we propose adapting video\ngeneration techniques for 3-D image generation. Using the temporal GAN (TGAN)\narchitecture, we show we are able to generate realistic head and neck PET\nimages. We also show that by conditioning the generator on tumour masks, we are\nable to control the geometry and location of the tumour in the generated\nimages. To test the utility of the synthetic images, we train a segmentation\nmodel using the synthetic images. Synthetic images conditioned on real tumour\nmasks are automatically segmented, and the corresponding real images are also\nsegmented. We evaluate the segmentations using the Dice score and find the\nsegmentation algorithm performs similarly on both datasets (0.65 synthetic\ndata, 0.70 real data). Various radionomic features are then calculated over the\nsegmented tumour volumes for each data set. A comparison of the real and\nsynthetic feature distributions show that seven of eight feature distributions\nhad statistically insignificant differences (p>0.05). Correlation coefficients\nwere also calculated between all radionomic features and it is shown that all\nof the strong statistical correlations in the real data set are preserved in\nthe synthetic data set.",

To overcome this issue and reveal\nthe available regularity, we consider cases in which analytic smoothing cannot\nbe performed, and introduce a novel numerical smoothing approach by combining a\nroot finding algorithm with one-dimensional integration with respect to a\nsingle well-selected variable. We prove that under appropriate conditions, the\nresulting function of the remaining variables is a highly smooth function,\npotentially affording the improved efficiency of adaptive sparse grid\nquadrature (ASGQ) and QMC methods, particularly when combined with hierarchical\ntransformations (i.e., Brownian bridge and Richardson extrapolation on the weak\nerror). This approach facilitates the effective treatment of high\ndimensionality. Our study is motivated by option pricing problems, and our\nfocus is on dynamics where the discretization of the asset price is necessary.\nBased on our analysis and numerical experiments, we show the advantages of\ncombining numerical smoothing with the ASGQ and QMC methods over ASGQ and QMC\nmethods without smoothing and the Monte Carlo approach.",

Understanding the patterns of emerging VOCs and forecasting\nmutations that may lead to gain of function or immune escape is urgently\nrequired. Here we developed PhyloTransformer, a Transformer-based\ndiscriminative model that engages a multi-head self-attention mechanism to\nmodel genetic mutations that may lead to viral reproductive advantage. In order\nto identify complex dependencies between the elements of each input sequence,\nPhyloTransformer utilizes advanced modeling techniques, including a novel Fast\nAttention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+) from\nPerformer, and the Masked Language Model (MLM) from Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT). PhyloTransformer was trained with\n1,765,297 genetic sequences retrieved from the Global Initiative for Sharing\nAll Influenza Data (GISAID) database.

    "abstract": "In embryogenesis, epithelial cells, acting as individual entities or as\ncoordinated aggregates in a tissue, exhibit strong coupling between chemical\nsignalling and mechanical responses to internally or externally applied\nstresses. Intercellular communication in combination with such coordination of\nmorphogenetic movements can lead to drastic modifications in the calcium\ndistribution in the cells. In this paper we extend the recent mechanochemical\nmodel in [K. Kaouri, P.K. Maini, P.A. Skourides, N. Christodoulou, S.J.\nChapman. J. Math. Biol., 78 (2019) 2059--2092], for an epithelial continuum in\none dimension, to a more realistic multi-dimensional case. The resulting\nparametrised governing equations consist of an advection-diffusion-reaction\nsystem for calcium signalling coupled with active-stress linear viscoelasticity\nand equipped with pure Neumann boundary conditions. We implement a mixed finite\nelement method for the simulation of this complex multiphysics problem. Special\ncare is taken in the treatment of the stress-free boundary conditions for the\nviscoelasticity in order to eliminate rigid motions from the space of\nadmissible displacements. The stability and solvability of the continuous weak\nformulation is shown using fixed-point theory. We investigate numerically the\nsolutions of this system and show that solitary waves and periodic wavetrains\nof calcium propagate through the embryonic epithelial sheet. We analyse the\nbifurcations of the system guided by the bifurcation analysis of the\none-dimensional model. We also demonstrate the nucleation of calcium sparks\ninto synchronous calcium waves coupled with contraction. This coupled model can\nbe employed to gain insights into recent experimental observations in the\ncontext of embryogenesis, but also in other biological systems such as cancer\ncells, wound healing, keratinocytes, or white blood cells.",

However, the state-of-art ZigBee backscatter system,\nInterscatter, has several drawbacks to deploy. Its backscatter tag and exciting\nsource, Bluetooth, can hardly decode packets from other ZigBee nodes, which\nleft Interscatter one-way communication. Besides, it adopts instantaneous phase\nchange to modulate information, producing obvious sidelobes and interfering\ndevices working on neighboring channels severely. To address the problems\nmentioned above, we introduce Homoscatter, a novel ZigBee backscatter system\nthat adopts specific ZigBee devices to generate a single tone and leverages\ncontinuous phase change to modulate information, which eliminates spectral\nleakage. It also does codeword translation on the packet header of exciting\npackets, improving the utilization of ambient signal.\nThe prototype of Homoscatter consists of a microchip radio, a backscatter\ntag, and a commodity receiver. The evaluations show that the occupied bandwidth\nof Homoscatter achieves 3x smaller than Interscatter. When the channel capacity\nis 17.5 kbps, the continuous phase change modulation achieves 13 kbps with the\ncodeword translation on the excitation header. Based on the widely spread IoT\ndevices, Homoscatter is a practical way to build an efficient connection\nbetween IoT devices.",

On high aspect ratio grids, it is\nfound that most gradients can exhibit a kind of numerical instability that may\nbe so severe as to make the gradient unusable. A theoretical analysis of the\ninstability reveals that it is triggered by roundoff errors in the calculation\nof the cell centroids, but ultimately is due to truncation errors of the\ngradient reconstruction scheme, rather than roundoff errors.

    "abstract": "Multiple antennas arrays play a key role in wireless networks for\ncommunications but also for localization and sensing applications. The use of\nlarge antenna arrays at high carrier frequencies (in the mmWave range) pushes\ntowards a propagation regime in which the wavefront is no longer plane but\nspherical. This allows to infer the position and orientation of a transmitting\nsource from the received signal without the need of using multiple anchor\nnodes, located in known positions. To understand the fundamental limits of\nlarge antenna arrays for localization, this paper combines wave propagation\ntheory with estimation theory, and computes the Cram\\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) for\nthe estimation of the source position on the basis of the three Cartesian\ncomponents of the electric field, observed over a rectangular surface area. The\nproblem is referred to as holographic positioning and is formulated by taking\ninto account the radiation angular pattern of the transmitting source, which is\ntypically ignored in standard signal processing models. We assume that the\nsource is a Hertzian dipole, and address the holographic positioning problem in\nboth cases, that is, with and without a priori knowledge of its orientation. To\nsimplify the analysis and gain further insights, we also consider the case in\nwhich the dipole is located on the line perpendicular to the surface center.\nNumerical and asymptotic results are given to quantify the CRBs, and to\nquantify the effect of various system parameters on the ultimate estimation\naccuracy.

The\nmajority of the existing research into the use of UAV access points for\ncellular coverage considers rotary-wing UAV designs (i.e. quadcopters).\nHowever, we expect fixed-wing UAVs to be more appropriate for connectivity\npurposes in scenarios where long flight times are necessary (such as for rural\ncoverage), as fixed-wing UAVs rely on a more energy-efficient form of flight\nwhen compared to the rotary-wing design. As fixed-wing UAVs are typically\nincapable of hovering in place, their deployment optimisation involves\noptimising their individual flight trajectories in a way that allows them to\ndeliver high quality service to the ground users in an energy-efficient manner.\nIn this paper, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach to\noptimise the energy efficiency of fixed-wing UAV cellular access points while\nstill allowing them to deliver high-quality service to users on the ground. In\nour decentralized approach, each UAV is equipped with a Dueling Deep Q-Network\n(DDQN) agent which can adjust the 3D trajectory of the UAV over a series of\ntimesteps. By coordinating with their neighbours, the UAVs adjust their\nindividual flight trajectories in a manner that optimises the total system\nenergy efficiency.

    "abstract": "Cluster analysis requires many decisions: the clustering method and the\nimplied reference model, the number of clusters and, often, several\nhyper-parameters and algorithms' tunings. In practice, one produces several\npartitions, and a final one is chosen based on validation or selection\ncriteria. There exist an abundance of validation methods that, implicitly or\nexplicitly, assume a certain clustering notion. Moreover, they are often\nrestricted to operate on partitions obtained from a specific method. In this\npaper, we focus on groups that can be well separated by quadratic or linear\nboundaries. The reference cluster concept is defined through the quadratic\ndiscriminant score function and parameters describing clusters' size, center\nand scatter. We develop two cluster-quality criteria called quadratic scores.\nWe show that these criteria are consistent with groups generated from a general\nclass of elliptically-symmetric distributions. The quest for this type of\ngroups is common in applications. The connection with likelihood theory for\nmixture models and model-based clustering is investigated. Based on bootstrap\nresampling of the quadratic scores, we propose a selection rule that allows\nchoosing among many clustering solutions. The proposed method has the\ndistinctive advantage that it can compare partitions that cannot be compared\nwith other state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "We introduce implicit Deep Adaptive Design (iDAD), a new method for\nperforming adaptive experiments in real-time with implicit models. iDAD\namortizes the cost of Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) by learning a\ndesign policy network upfront, which can then be deployed quickly at the time\nof the experiment. The iDAD network can be trained on any model which simulates\ndifferentiable samples, unlike previous design policy work that requires a\nclosed form likelihood and conditionally independent experiments. At\ndeployment, iDAD allows design decisions to be made in milliseconds, in\ncontrast to traditional BOED approaches that require heavy computation during\nthe experiment itself. We illustrate the applicability of iDAD on a number of\nexperiments, and show that it provides a fast and effective mechanism for\nperforming adaptive design with implicit models.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose a cross-domain multi-objective speech assessment\nmodel, i.e., the MOSA-Net, which can estimate multiple speech assessment\nmetrics simultaneously. More specifically, the MOSA-Net is designed to estimate\nspeech quality, intelligibility, and distortion assessment scores based on a\ntest speech signal as input. It comprises a convolutional neural network and\nbidirectional long short-term memory (CNN-BLSTM) architecture for\nrepresentation extraction, as well as a multiplicative attention layer and a\nfully-connected layer for each assessment metric. In addition, cross-domain\nfeatures (spectral and time-domain features) and latent representations from\nself-supervised learned models are used as inputs to combine rich acoustic\ninformation from different speech representations to obtain more accurate\nassessments. Experimental results reveal that the MOSA-Net can precisely\npredict perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), short-time objective\nintelligibility (STOI), and speech distortion index (SDI) scores when tested on\nboth noisy and enhanced speech utterances under either seen test conditions\n(where the test speakers and noise types are involved in the training set) or\nunseen test conditions (where the test speakers and noise types are not\ninvolved in the training set). In light of the confirmed prediction capability,\nwe further adopt the latent representations of the MOSA-Net to guide the speech\nenhancement (SE) process and derive a quality-intelligibility (QI)-aware SE\n(QIA-SE) approach accordingly. Experimental results show that QIA-SE provides\nsuperior enhancement performance compared with the baseline SE system in terms\nof objective evaluation metrics and qualitative evaluation test.",

    "abstract": "The exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) have emerged as an\nimportant framework for modeling social and other networks. ERGMs for valued\nnetworks are less well-studied than their unvalued counterparts, and pose\nparticular computational challenges. Networks with edge values on the\nnon-negative integers (count-valued networks) are an important such case, with\napplications ranging from migration and trade flow data to data on frequency of\ninteractions and encounters. Here, we propose an efficient maximum\npseudo-likelihood estimation (MPLE) scheme for count-valued ERGMs, and compare\nits performance with existing Contrastive Divergence (CD) and Monte Carlo\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (MCMLE) approaches via a simulation study based\non migration flow networks in two U.S states. Our results suggest that edge\nvalue variance is a key factor in method performance, with high-variance edges\nposing a particular challenge for CD. MCMLE can work well but requires careful\nseeding in the high-variance case, and the MPLE itself performs well when edge\nvariance is high.",

In this paper, we focus on\nself-supervised representation learning for voice conversion. Specifically, we\ncompare discrete and soft speech units as input features. We find that discrete\nrepresentations effectively remove speaker information but discard some\nlinguistic content - leading to mispronunciations. As a solution, we propose\nsoft speech units. To learn soft units, we predict a distribution over discrete\nspeech units. By modeling uncertainty, soft units capture more content\ninformation, improving the intelligibility and naturalness of converted speech.\nSamples available at https://ubisoft-laforge.github.io/speech/soft-vc/",
