    "title": "A Survey of Blockchain Data Management Systems",
    "abstract": "Blockchain has been widely deployed in various sectors, such as finance,\neducation, and public services. Since blockchain runs as an immutable\ndistributed ledger, it has decentralized mechanisms with persistency,\nanonymity, and auditability, where transactions are jointly performed through\ncryptocurrency-based consensus algorithms by worldwide distributed nodes. There\nhave been many survey papers reviewing the blockchain technologies from\ndifferent perspectives, e.g., digital currencies, consensus algorithms, and\nsmart contracts. However, none of them have focused on the blockchain data\nmanagement systems. To fill in this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive\nsurvey on the data management systems, based on three typical types of\nblockchain, i.e., standard blockchain, hybrid blockchain, and DAG (Directed\nAcyclic Graph)-based blockchain. We categorize their data management mechanisms\ninto three layers: blockchain architecture, blockchain data structure, and\nblockchain storage engine, where block architecture indicates how to record\ntransactions on a distributed ledger, blockchain data structure refers to the\ninternal structure of each block, and blockchain storage engine specifies the\nstorage form of data on the blockchain system. For each layer, the works\nadvancing the state-of-the-art are discussed together with technical\nchallenges. Furthermore, we lay out the future research directions for the\nblockchain data management systems.",

    "title": "Spatio-Temporal Joint Graph Convolutional Networks for Traffic  Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Recent studies focus on formulating the traffic forecasting as a\nspatio-temporal graph modeling problem. They typically construct a static\nspatial graph at each time step and then connect each node with itself between\nadjacent time steps to construct the spatio-temporal graph. In such a graph,\nthe correlations between different nodes at different time steps are not\nexplicitly reflected, which may restrict the learning ability of graph neural\nnetworks. Meanwhile, those models ignore the dynamic spatio-temporal\ncorrelations among nodes as they use the same adjacency matrix at different\ntime steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Joint\nGraph Convolutional Networks (STJGCN) for traffic forecasting over several time\nsteps ahead on a road network. Specifically, we construct both pre-defined and\nadaptive spatio-temporal joint graphs (STJGs) between any two time steps, which\nrepresent comprehensive and dynamic spatio-temporal correlations. We further\ndesign dilated causal spatio-temporal joint graph convolution layers on STJG to\ncapture the spatio-temporal dependencies from distinct perspectives with\nmultiple ranges. A multi-range attention mechanism is proposed to aggregate the\ninformation of different ranges. Experiments on four public traffic datasets\ndemonstrate that STJGCN is computationally efficient and outperforms 11\nstate-of-the-art baseline methods.",

While recently proposed\nbenchmarks demonstrate that most of the existing algorithms do not outperform\nsimple baselines, the established evaluation methods fail to expose the impact\nof various factors that contribute to the poor performance. In this paper we\npropose an evaluation framework for domain generalization algorithms that\nallows decomposition of the error into components capturing distinct aspects of\ngeneralization. Inspired by the prevalence of algorithms based on the idea of\ndomain-invariant representation learning, we extend the evaluation framework to\ncapture various types of failures in achieving invariance. We show that the\nlargest contributor to the generalization error varies across methods,\ndatasets, regularization strengths and even training lengths. We observe two\nproblems associated with the strategy of learning domain-invariant\nrepresentations. On Colored MNIST, most domain generalization algorithms fail\nbecause they reach domain-invariance only on the training domains. On\nCamelyon-17, domain-invariance degrades the quality of representations on\nunseen domains.

    "abstract": "We present the near-Maximal Algorithm for Poisson-disk Sampling (nMAPS) to\ngenerate point distributions for variable resolution Delaunay triangular and\ntetrahedral meshes in two and three-dimensions, respectively. nMAPS consists of\ntwo principal stages. In the first stage, an initial point distribution is\nproduced using a cell-based rejection algorithm. In the second stage, holes in\nthe sample are detected using an efficient background grid and filled in to\nobtain a near-maximal covering. Extensive testing shows that nMAPS generates a\nvariable resolution mesh in linear run time with the number of accepted points.\nWe demonstrate nMAPS capabilities by meshing three-dimensional discrete\nfracture networks (DFN) and the surrounding volume. The discretized boundaries\nof the fractures, which are represented as planar polygons, are used as the\nseed of 2D-nMAPS to produce a conforming Delaunay triangulation. The combined\nmesh of the DFN is used as the seed for 3D-nMAPS, which produces conforming\nDelaunay tetrahedra surrounding the network. Under a set of conditions that\nnaturally arise in maximal Poisson-disk samples and are satisfied by nMAPS, the\ntwo-dimensional Delaunay triangulations are guaranteed to only have\nwell-behaved triangular faces. While nMAPS does not provide triangulation\nquality bounds in more than two dimensions, we found that low-quality\ntetrahedra in 3D are infrequent, can be readily detected and removed, and a\nhigh quality balanced mesh is produced.",

    "title": "A Unified Framework of Light Spanners II: Fine-Grained Optimality",
    "abstract": "Seminal works on light spanners over the years provide spanners with optimal\nlightness in various graph classes, such as in general graphs, Euclidean\nspanners, and minor-free graphs. Three shortcomings of previous works on light\nspanners are: (1) The techniques are ad hoc per graph class, and thus can't be\napplied broadly. (2) The runtimes of these constructions are almost always\nsub-optimal, and usually far from optimal. (3) These constructions are optimal\nin the standard and crude sense, but not in a refined sense that takes into\naccount a wider range of involved parameters.\nThis work aims at addressing these shortcomings by presenting a unified\nframework of light spanners in a variety of graph classes. Informally, the\nframework boils down to a transformation from sparse spanners to light\nspanners; since the state-of-the-art for sparse spanners is much more advanced\nthan that for light spanners, such a transformation is powerful. Our framework\nis developed in two papers. The current paper is the second of the two -- it\nbuilds on the basis of the unified framework laid in the first paper, and then\nstrengthens it to achieve more refined optimality bounds for several graph\nclasses. Among various applications and implications of our framework, we\nhighlight here the following:\nFor $K_r$-minor-free graphs, we provide a $(1+\\epsilon)$-spanner with\nlightness $\\tilde{O}_{r,\\epsilon}( \\frac{r}{\\epsilon} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2})$,\nimproving the lightness bound $\\tilde{O}_{r,\\epsilon}( \\frac{r}{\\epsilon^3})$\nof Borradaile, Le and Wulff-Nilsen. We complement our upper bound with a lower\nbound construction, for which any $(1+\\epsilon)$-spanner must have lightness\n$\\Omega(\\frac{r}{\\epsilon} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2})$. We note that the quadratic\ndependency on $1/\\epsilon$ we proved here is surprising, as the prior work\nsuggested that the dependency on $\\epsilon$ should be $1/\\epsilon$.",

    "abstract": "An ensuing challenge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the perceived\ndifficulty in interpreting sophisticated machine learning models, whose\never-increasing complexity makes it hard for such models to be understood,\ntrusted and thus accepted by human beings. The lack, if not complete absence,\nof interpretability for these so-called black-box models can lead to serious\neconomic and ethical consequences, thereby hindering the development and\ndeployment of AI in wider fields, particularly in those involving critical and\nregulatory applications. Yet, the building services industry is a\nhighly-regulated domain requiring transparency and decision-making processes\nthat can be understood and trusted by humans. To this end, the design and\nimplementation of autonomous Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems\nfor the automatic but concurrently interpretable optimisation of energy\nefficiency and room thermal comfort is of topical interest. This work therefore\npresents an interpretable machine learning model aimed at predicting room\ntemperature in non-domestic buildings, for the purpose of optimising the use of\nthe installed HVAC system. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed\nmodel can accurately forecast room temperatures eight hours ahead in real-time\nby taking into account historical RT information, as well as additional\nenvironmental and time-series features. In this paper, an enhanced feature\nengineering process is conducted based on the Exploratory Data Analysis\nresults. Furthermore, beyond the commonly used Interpretable Machine Learning\ntechniques, we propose a Permutation Feature-based Frequency Response Analysis\n(PF-FRA) method for quantifying the contributions of the different predictors\nin the frequency domain. Based on the generated reason codes, we find that the\nhistorical RT feature is the dominant factor that has most impact on the model\nprediction.",

    "abstract": "Energy-based modeling is a promising approach to unsupervised learning, which\nyields many downstream applications from a single model. The main difficulty in\nlearning energy-based models with the \"contrastive approaches\" is the\ngeneration of samples from the current energy function at each iteration. Many\nadvances have been made to accomplish this subroutine cheaply. Nevertheless,\nall such sampling paradigms run MCMC targeting the current model, which\nrequires infinitely long chains to generate samples from the true energy\ndistribution and is problematic in practice. This paper proposes an alternative\napproach to getting these samples and avoiding crude MCMC sampling from the\ncurrent model. We accomplish this by viewing the evolution of the modeling\ndistribution as (i) the evolution of the energy function, and (ii) the\nevolution of the samples from this distribution along some vector field. We\nsubsequently derive this time-dependent vector field such that the particles\nfollowing this field are approximately distributed as the current density\nmodel. Thereby we match the evolution of the particles with the evolution of\nthe energy function prescribed by the learning procedure. Importantly, unlike\nMonte Carlo sampling, our method targets to match the current distribution in a\nfinite time. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness empirically compared to\nMCMC-based learning methods.",

    "title": "Empathosphere: Promoting Constructive Communication in Ad-hoc Virtual  Teams through Perspective-taking Spaces",
    "abstract": "When members of ad-hoc virtual teams need to collectively ideate or\ndeliberate, they often fail to engage with each others' perspectives in a\nconstructive manner. At best, this leads to sub-optimal outcomes and, at worst,\nit can cause conflicts that lead to teams not wanting to continue working\ntogether. Prior work has attempted to facilitate constructive communication by\nhighlighting problematic communication patterns and nudging teams to alter\ninteraction norms. However, these approaches achieve limited success because\nthey fail to acknowledge two social barriers: (1) it is hard to reset team\nnorms mid-interaction, and (2) corrective nudges have limited utility unless\nteam members believe it is safe to voice their opinion and that their opinion\nwill be heard. This paper introduces Empathosphere, a chat-embedded\nintervention to mitigate these barriers and foster constructive communication\nin teams. To mitigate the first barrier, Empathosphere leverages the benefits\nof \"experimental spaces\" in dampening existing norms and creating a climate\nconducive to change. To mitigate the second barrier, Empathosphere harnesses\nthe benefits of perspective-taking to cultivate a group climate that promotes a\nnorm of members speaking up and engaging with each other. Empathosphere\nachieves this by orchestrating authentic socio-emotional exchanges designed to\ninduce perspective-taking. A controlled study (N=110) compared Empathosphere to\nan alternate intervention strategy of prompting teams to reflect on their team\nexperience. We found that Empathosphere led to higher work satisfaction,\nencouraged more open communication and feedback within teams, and boosted\nteams' desire to continue working together. This work demonstrates that\n``experimental spaces,'' particularly those that integrate methods of\nencouraging perspective-taking, can be a powerful means of improving\ncommunication in virtual teams.",

    "abstract": "Facial landmark detection is a very fundamental and significant vision task\nwith many important applications. In practice, facial landmark detection can be\naffected by a lot of natural degradations. One of the most common and important\ndegradations is the shadow caused by light source blocking. While many advanced\nshadow removal methods have been proposed to recover the image quality in\nrecent years, their effects to facial landmark detection are not well studied.\nFor example, it remains unclear whether shadow removal could enhance the\nrobustness of facial landmark detection to diverse shadow patterns or not. In\nthis work, for the first attempt, we construct a novel benchmark to link two\nindependent but related tasks (i.e., shadow removal and facial landmark\ndetection). In particular, the proposed benchmark covers diverse face shadows\nwith different intensities, sizes, shapes, and locations. Moreover, to mine\nhard shadow patterns against facial landmark detection, we propose a novel\nmethod (i.e., adversarial shadow attack), which allows us to construct a\nchallenging subset of the benchmark for a comprehensive analysis. With the\nconstructed benchmark, we conduct extensive analysis on three state-of-the-art\nshadow removal methods and three landmark detectors. The observation of this\nwork motivates us to design a novel detection-aware shadow removal framework,\nwhich empowers shadow removal to achieve higher restoration quality and enhance\nthe shadow robustness of deployed facial landmark detectors.",

Specifically, an hourly parameterized\nJacobi diffusion process is constructed to recreate the temporal patterns of PV\nvolatility during a day.

    "abstract": "Pedestrian safety is a priority for transportation system managers and\noperators, and a main focus of the Vision Zero strategy employed by the City of\nAustin, Texas. While there are a number of treatments and technologies to\neffectively improve pedestrian safety, identifying the location where these\ntreatments are most needed remains a challenge. Current practice requires\nmanual observation of candidate locations for limited time periods, leading to\nan identification process that is time consuming, lags behind traffic pattern\nchanges over time, and lacks scalability. Mid-block locations, where safety\ncountermeasures are often needed the most, are especially hard to identify and\nmonitor. The goal for this research is to understand the correlation between\nbus stop locations and mid-block crossings, so as to assist traffic engineers\nin implementing Vision Zero strategies to improve pedestrian safety. In a prior\nwork, we have developed a tool to detect pedestrian crossing events with\ntraffic camera video using a deep neural network model to identify crossing\nevents. In this paper, we extend the methods to identify bus stop usage with\ntraffic camera video from off-the-shelf CCTV pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) traffic\nmonitoring cameras installed at nearby intersections. We correlate the video\ndetection results for mid-block crossings near a bus stop, with pedestrian\nactivity at the bus stops in each side of the mid-block crossing. We also\nimplement a web portal to facilitate manual review of pedestrian activity\ndetections by automating creation of video clips that show only crossing\nevents, thereby vastly improving the efficiency of the human review process.",

In this\narticle, we first present the online construction of a topological map and the\nimplementation of a control law for guiding the robot to the nearest unexplored\narea, first presented in [1]. The proposed method operates by allowing the\nrobot to localize itself on a partially constructed map, calculate a path to\nunexplored parts of the environment (frontiers), compute a robust terminating\ncondition when the robot has fully explored the environment, and achieve loop\nclosure detection. The proposed algorithm results in smooth safe paths for the\nrobot's navigation needs. The presented approach is any time algorithm that has\nthe advantage that it allows for the active creation of topological maps from\nlaser scan data, as it is being acquired. We also propose a navigation strategy\nbased on a heuristic where the robot is directed towards nodes in the\ntopological map that open to empty space. We then extend the work in [1] by\npresenting a topology matching algorithm that leverages the strengths of a\nparticular spectral correspondence method [2], to match the mapped environments\ngenerated from our topology-making algorithm. Here, we concentrated on\nimplementing a system that could be used to match the topologies of the mapped\nenvironment by using AOF Skeletons. In topology matching between two given maps\nand their AOF skeletons, we first find correspondences between points on the\nAOF skeletons of two different environments. We then align the (2D) points of\nthe environments themselves. We also compute a distance measure between two\ngiven environments, based on their extracted AOF skeletons and their topology,\nas the sum of the matching errors between corresponding points.",

To tackle\nthis challenge, we first formalize the OOD generalization problem as\nconstrained optimization, called Disentanglement-constrained Domain\nGeneralization (DDG). We relax this non-trivial constrained optimization to a\ntractable form with finite-dimensional parameterization and empirical\napproximation.

In contrast to traditional\napproaches based on domain adversarial training and domain labels, DDG jointly\nlearns semantic and variation encoders for disentanglement, enabling flexible\nmanipulation and augmentation on training data. DDG aims to learn intrinsic\nrepresentations of semantic concepts that are invariant to nuisance factors and\ngeneralizable across different domains.

Almost all existing gradient-based attack methods use\nthe sign function in the generation to meet the requirement of perturbation\nbudget on $L_\\infty$ norm. However, we find that the sign function may be\nimproper for generating adversarial examples since it modifies the exact\ngradient direction. We propose to remove the sign function and directly utilize\nthe exact gradient direction with a scaling factor for generating adversarial\nperturbations, which improves the attack success rates of adversarial examples\neven with fewer perturbations. Moreover, considering that the best scaling\nfactor varies across different images, we propose an adaptive scaling factor\ngenerator to seek an appropriate scaling factor for each image, which avoids\nthe computational cost for manually searching the scaling factor.

To address\nthis issue, we propose the transdimensional approach as an alternative.

The TPPP includes the 1D PPPs on the\nstreets passing through the receiving vehicle and models the remaining vehicles\nas a 2D PPP ignoring their street geometry. Through the SIR MD analysis, we\nshow that the TPPP provides good approximations to the more cumbrous models\nwith streets characterized by Poisson line/stick processes; and we prove that\nthe accuracy of the TPPP further improves under shadowing. Lastly, we use the\nMD results to control network congestion by adjusting the transmit rate while\nmaintaining a target fraction of reliable links.

Briefly, the HAINEX consists of the following modules: an\nimproved industrial bidirectional encoder for extracting semantic features, a\nbidirectional long short-term memory network for obtaining the context\nrepresentation, and a decoder based on conditional random field with an\nimproved industrial loss function. Finally, the constructed HAZOP triples are\nimported into the graph database. Experiments show that HAINEX is advanced and\nreliable. We take the indirect coal liquefaction process as a case study to\ndevelop ISKG. ISKG oriented applications, such as ISK visualization, ISK\nretrieval, auxiliary HAZOP and hazard propagation reasoning, can mine the\npotential of ISK and improve HAZOP efficiency, which is of great significance\nin strengthening industrial safety. What is more, the ISKG based\nquestion-answering system can be applied to teaching guidance to popularize the\nsafety knowledge and enhance prevention awareness for non-professionals.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a novel, general and ingenious activation function termed MDAC\nis proposed to surmount the troubles of gradient vanishing and\nnon-differentiable existence. MDAC approximately inherits the properties of\nexponential activation function (such as Tanh family) and piecewise linear\nactivation function (such as ReLU family). Specifically, in the positive\nregion, the adaptive linear structure is designed to respond to various domain\ndistributions. In the negative region, the combination of exponent and\nlinearity is considered to conquer the obstacle of gradient vanishing.\nFurthermore, the non-differentiable existence is eliminated by smooth\napproximation. Experiments show that MDAC improves performance on both\nclassical models and pre-training optimization models in six domain datasets by\nsimply changing the activation function, which indicates MDAC's effectiveness\nand pro-gressiveness. MDAC is superior to other prevalent activation functions\nin robustness and generalization, and can reflect excellent activation\nperformance in multiple domains.",

When $\\Omega=[0,1]$, such graphs include the standard\nToeplitz graphs and, for $\\Omega=[0,1]^d$, the considered class includes\n$d$-level Toeplitz graphs. In the general case, the underlying sequence of\nadjacency matrices has a canonical eigenvalue distribution, in the Weyl sense,\nand it has been shown in the theoretical part of this work that we can\nassociate to it a symbol $\\boldsymbol{\\mathfrak{f}}$. The knowledge of the\nsymbol and of its basic analytical features provides key information on the\neigenvalue structure in terms of localization, spectral gap, clustering, and\nglobal distribution. In the present paper, many different applications are\ndiscussed and various numerical examples are presented in order to underline\nthe practical use of the developed theory. Tests and applications are mainly\nobtained from the approximation of differential operators via numerical schemes\nsuch as Finite Differences (FDs), Finite Elements (FEs), and Isogeometric\nAnalysis (IgA). Moreover, we show that more applications can be taken into\naccount, since the results presented here can be applied as well to study the\nspectral properties of adjacency matrices and Laplacian operators of general\nlarge graphs and networks, whenever the involved matrices enjoy a uniform local\nstructure.",

However, the information density of industrial safety analysis\ntext is relatively high, and the correlation and similarity between the\ninformation are large, which is easy to cause the problem of high deviation and\nhigh standard deviation of the model, no specific activation function has been\ndesigned in previous studies, and the traditional activation function has the\nproblems of gradient vanishing and negative region, which also lead to the\nrecognition accuracy of the model can not be further improved. To solve these\nproblems, a novel activation function AIS is proposed in this paper. AIS is an\nactivation function applied in industrial safety engineering, which is composed\nof two piecewise nonlinear functions. In the positive region, the structure\ncombining exponential function and quadratic function is used to alleviate the\nproblem of deviation and standard deviation, and the linear function is added\nto modify it, which makes the whole activation function smoother and overcomes\nthe problem of gradient vanishing. In the negative region, the cubic function\nstructure is used to solve the negative region problem and accelerate the\nconvergence of the model. Based on the deep learning model of BERT-BiLSTM-CRF,\nthe performance of AIS is evaluated.

    "abstract": "When we develop wearable assistive devices comfort and support are two main\nissues needed to be considered. In conventional design approaches, the degree\nof freedom of wearer's joint movement tends to be oversimplified. Accordingly,\nthe wearer's motion becomes restrained and bone/ligament injuries might occur\nin case of unexpected fall. To mitigate those issues, this letter proposes a\nnovel joint link mechanism inspired by a human spine structure as well as\nfunctionalities. The key feature of the proposed spine-like joint link\nmechanism is that hemispherical blocks are concatenated via flexible synthetic\nfiber lines so that their concatenation stiffness can be adjusted according to\na tensile force. This feature has a great potentiality for designing a wearable\nassistive devices that can support aged people's sit-to-stand action or augment\na spinal motion by regulating the concatenation stiffness. In addition, the\nconcatenated hemispherical blocks enables the wearer to move his/her joint with\nthe full degree of freedom, which in turn, increases wearer's mobility and\nprevents joint misalignment. The experimental results with a testbed and a\npilot wearer substantiated that the spine-like joint link mechanism can serve\nas a key component to design the wearable assistive devices for better mobility\nand safety.",

However, the mixed-motive environments\ntypically studied have a single cooperative outcome on which all agents can\nagree. Many real-world multi-agent environments are instead bargaining problems\n(BPs): they have several Pareto-optimal payoff profiles over which agents have\nconflicting preferences. We argue that typical cooperation-inducing learning\nalgorithms fail to cooperate in BPs when there is room for normative\ndisagreement resulting in the existence of multiple competing cooperative\nequilibria, and illustrate this problem empirically. To remedy the issue, we\nintroduce the notion of norm-adaptive policies. Norm-adaptive policies are\ncapable of behaving according to different norms in different circumstances,\ncreating opportunities for resolving normative disagreement. We develop a class\nof norm-adaptive policies and show in experiments that these significantly\nincrease cooperation.

Such loads change their magnitude and/or\nlocation as the topology optimization advances and pose several unique\nchallenges, e.g., non-monotonous behavior of compliance objective, parasitic\neffects of the low-stiffness elements and unconstrained nature of the problems.\nThe modified SIMP material interpolation in conjunction with the three-field\ndensity representation technique (original, filtered and projected design\nfields) is employed to achieve optimized solutions close to 0-1. Thus,\nparasitic effects of low-stiffness elements are circumvented. The mass density\nof each element is interpolated via a smooth Heaviside function yielding\ncontinuous transition between solid and void states of elements. This helps\nformulate a constraint on the maximum magnitude of the self-weight for the\ngiven volume in a such a manner that which implicitly imposes a lower bound on\nthe permitted volume. The propose approach maintains the constrained nature of\nthe optimization problem. Load sensitivities are evaluated using the\nadjoint-variable method. Compliance of the domain is minimized to achieve the\noptimized designs using the Method of Moving Asymptotes. Efficacy and\nrobustness of the presented approach is demonstrated by designing various 2D\nand 3D structures involving self-weight.",

In contrast to most existing methods that use\ndeep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or radial basis functions to simply\nlearn the regularization term, we formulate both the data term and\nregularization term and split the deconvolution model into data-related and\nregularization-related sub-problems according to the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers.

This task is\ncommon but overlooked by previous person search works which focus on\nsurveillance scenes. The media scenarios have some different challenges from\nsurveillance scenes. For example, a person may change his clothes frequently.\nTo alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a Unified Detector and Graph\nNetwork (UDGNet) for person search in media. UDGNet is the first person search\nframework to detect and re-identify the human body and head simultaneously.\nSpecifically, it first builds two branches based on a unified network to detect\nthe human body and head, then the detected body and head are used for\nre-identification. This dual-task approach can significantly enhance\ndiscriminative learning. To tackle the cloth-changing issue, UDGNet builds two\ngraphs to explore reliable links among cloth-changing samples and utilizes a\ngraph network to learn better embeddings. This design effectively enhances the\nrobustness of person search to cloth-changing challenges. Besides, we\ndemonstrate that UDGNet can be implemented with both anchor-based and\nanchor-free person search frameworks and further achieve performance\nimprovement.

In this work, we address\nthe fundamental problem of finding a robust pose representation for motion\nmodeling, suitable for deep character animation, one that can better constrain\nposes and faithfully capture nuances correlated with skeletal characteristics.\nOur representation is based on dual quaternions, the mathematical abstractions\nwith well-defined operations, which simultaneously encode rotational and\npositional orientation, enabling a hierarchy-aware encoding, centered around\nthe root. We demonstrate that our representation overcomes common motion\nartifacts, and assess its performance compared to other popular\nrepresentations. We conduct an ablation study to evaluate the impact of various\nlosses that can be incorporated during learning. Leveraging the fact that our\nrepresentation implicitly encodes skeletal motion attributes, we train a\nnetwork on a dataset comprising of skeletons with different proportions,\nwithout the need to retarget them first to a universal skeleton, which causes\nsubtle motion elements to be missed. We show that smooth and natural poses can\nbe achieved, paving the way for fascinating applications.",

In this paper, we present a new approach for\nvalidation based on learning curves (LCCV).

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning has achieved remarkable success on various high-level\ntasks, but there are fewer methods proposed for low-level tasks. It is\nchallenging to adopt vanilla contrastive learning technologies proposed for\nhigh-level visual tasks straight to low-level visual tasks since the acquired\nglobal visual representations are insufficient for low-level tasks requiring\nrich texture and context information. In this paper, we propose a novel\ncontrastive learning framework for single image super-resolution (SISR). We\ninvestigate the contrastive learning-based SISR from two perspectives: sample\nconstruction and feature embedding. The existing methods propose some naive\nsample construction approaches (e.g., considering the low-quality input as a\nnegative sample and the ground truth as a positive sample) and they adopt a\nprior model (e.g., pre-trained VGG model) to obtain the feature embedding\ninstead of exploring a task-friendly one. To this end, we propose a practical\ncontrastive learning framework for SISR that involves the generation of many\ninformative positive and hard negative samples in frequency space. Instead of\nutilizing an additional pre-trained network, we design a simple but effective\nembedding network inherited from the discriminator network and can be\niteratively optimized with the primary SR network making it task-generalizable.\nFinally, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of our method compared\nwith benchmark methods and show remarkable gains of up to 0.21 dB over the\ncurrent state-of-the-art approaches for SISR.",

However, they\nignore that some crucial characteristics are stubbornly entwined in both the\ndomain-relevant interference and identity-relevant feature, which are\nintractable to decompose in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple yet effective Calibrated Feature Decomposition (CFD) module that focuses\non improving the generalization capacity for person re-identification through a\nmore judicious feature decomposition and reinforcement strategy. Specifically,\na calibrated-and-standardized Batch normalization (CSBN) is designed to learn\ncalibrated person representation by jointly exploring intra-domain calibration\nand inter-domain standardization of multi-source domain features. CSBN\nrestricts instance-level inconsistency of feature distribution for each domain\nand captures intrinsic domain-level specific statistics. The calibrated person\nrepresentation is subtly decomposed into the identity-relevant feature, domain\nfeature, and the remaining entangled one. For enhancing the generalization\nability and ensuring high discrimination of the identity-relevant feature, a\ncalibrated instance normalization (CIN) is introduced to enforce discriminative\nid-relevant information, and filter out id-irrelevant information, and\nmeanwhile the rich complementary clues from the remaining entangled feature are\nfurther employed to strengthen it.

Therefore, in this work, we conduct an interpretation study of\nrecently proposed DR models. Specifically, we first discretize the embeddings\noutput by the document and query encoders. Based on the discrete\nrepresentations, we analyze the attribution of input tokens. Both qualitative\nand quantitative experiments are carried out on public test collections.\nResults suggest that DR models pay attention to different aspects of input and\nextract various high-level topic representations.

    "abstract": "Sparse Conditional Random Field (CRF) is a powerful technique in computer\nvision and natural language processing for structured prediction. However,\nsolving sparse CRFs in large-scale applications remains challenging. In this\npaper, we propose a novel safe dynamic screening method that exploits an\naccurate dual optimum estimation to identify and remove the irrelevant features\nduring the training process. Thus, the problem size can be reduced\ncontinuously, leading to great savings in the computational cost without\nsacrificing any accuracy on the finally learned model. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first screening method which introduces the dual optimum\nestimation technique -- by carefully exploring and exploiting the strong\nconvexity and the complex structure of the dual problem -- in static screening\nmethods to dynamic screening. In this way, we can absorb the advantages of both\nthe static and dynamic screening methods and avoid their drawbacks. Our\nestimation would be much more accurate than those developed based on the\nduality gap, which contributes to a much stronger screening rule. Moreover, our\nmethod is also the first screening method in sparse CRFs and even structure\nprediction models. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that the speedup gained by our method is significant.",

In the US Veteran\nAffairs Health Care System (VA), many of the enrollees are susceptible to\nCOVID-19. Predicting the COVID-19 to allocate medical resources promptly\nbecomes a critical issue. When the VA enrollees have COVID-19 symptoms, it is\nrecommended that their first step should be to call the VA Call Center. For\nconfirmed COVID-19 patients, the median time from the first symptom to hospital\nadmission was seven days. By predicting the number of COVID-19 related calls,\nwe could predict imminent surges in healthcare use and plan medical resources\nahead. Objective: The study aims to develop a method to forecast the daily\nnumber of COVID-19 related calls for each of the 110 VA medical centers.\nMethods: In the proposed method, we pre-trained a model using a cluster of\nmedical centers and fine-tuned it for individual medical centers. At the\ncluster level, we performed feature selection to select significant features\nand automatic hyper-parameter search to select optimal hyper-parameter value\ncombinations for the model. Conclusions: This study proposed an accurate method\nto forecast the daily number of COVID-19 related calls for VA medical centers.\nThe proposed method was able to overcome modeling challenges by grouping\nsimilar medical centers into clusters to enlarge the dataset for training\nmodels, and using hyper-parameter search to automatically find optimal\nhyper-parameter value combinations for models.

    "abstract": "The recently introduced online Minimum Peak Appointment Scheduling (MPAS)\nproblem is a variant of the online bin-packing problem that allows for deferred\ndecision making. Specifically, it allows for the problem to be split into an\nonline phase where a stream of appointment requests arrive requiring a\nscheduled time, followed by an offline phase where those appointments are\nscheduled into rooms. Similar to the bin-packing problem, the aim is to use the\nminimum number of rooms in the final configuration. This model more accurately\ncaptures scheduling appointments than bin packing. For example, a dialysis\npatient needs to know what time to arrive for an appointment, but does not need\nto know the assigned station ahead of time.\nPrevious work developed a randomized algorithm for this problem which\nachieved an asymptotic competitive ratio of at most 1.5, proving that online\nMPAS was fundamentally different from the online bin-packing problem. Our main\ncontribution is to develop a new randomized algorithm for the problem that\nachieves an asymptotic competitive ratio under 1.455, indicating the potential\nfor further progress. This improvement is attained by modifying the process for\nscheduling appointments to increase the density of the packing in the worst\ncase, along with utilizing the dual of the bin-packing linear programming\nrelaxation to perform the analysis. We also present the first known lower bound\nof 1.2 on the asymptotic competitive ratio of both deterministic and randomized\nonline MPAS algorithm. These results demonstrate how deferred decision-making\ncan be leveraged to yield improved worst-case performance, a phenomenon which\nshould be investigated in a broader class of settings.",

Prior work in AMR-based summarization has\nautomatically merged the individual sentence graphs into a document graph, but\nthe method of merging and its effects on summary content selection have not\nbeen independently evaluated. In this paper, we present a novel dataset\nconsisting of human-annotated alignments between the nodes of paired documents\nand summaries which may be used to evaluate (1) merge strategies; and (2) the\nperformance of content selection methods over nodes of a merged or unmerged AMR\ngraph.

    "abstract": "Real-world data often exhibits long tail distributions with heavy class\nimbalance, where the majority classes can dominate the training process and\nalter the decision boundaries of the minority classes. Recently, researchers\nhave investigated the potential of supervised contrastive learning for\nlong-tailed recognition, and demonstrated that it provides a strong performance\ngain. In this paper, we show that while supervised contrastive learning can\nhelp improve performance, past baselines suffer from poor uniformity brought in\nby imbalanced data distribution. This poor uniformity manifests in samples from\nthe minority class having poor separability in the feature space. To address\nthis problem, we propose targeted supervised contrastive learning (TSC), which\nimproves the uniformity of the feature distribution on the hypersphere. TSC\nfirst generates a set of targets uniformly distributed on a hypersphere. It\nthen makes the features of different classes converge to these distinct and\nuniformly distributed targets during training. This forces all classes,\nincluding minority classes, to maintain a uniform distribution in the feature\nspace, improves class boundaries, and provides better generalization even in\nthe presence of long-tail data. Experiments on multiple datasets show that TSC\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on long-tailed recognition tasks.",

Hence, there is a great demand for\nautomatic answer generation systems that provide quick responses using related\ninformation about the product. There are three sources of knowledge available\nfor answering a user posted query, they are reviews, duplicate or similar\nquestions, and specifications. Effectively utilizing these information sources\nwill greatly aid us in answering complex questions. However, there are two main\nchallenges present in exploiting these sources: (i) The presence of irrelevant\ninformation and (ii) the presence of ambiguity of sentiment present in reviews\nand similar questions. Through this work we propose a novel pipeline (MSQAP)\nthat utilizes the rich information present in the aforementioned sources by\nseparately performing relevancy and ambiguity prediction before generating a\nresponse.\nExperimental results show that our relevancy prediction model (BERT-QA)\noutperforms all other variants and has an improvement of 12.36% in F1 score\ncompared to the BERT-base baseline.

Human evaluation of our pipeline shows us\nthat our method has an overall improvement in accuracy of 30.7% over the\ngeneration model (T5-QA), resulting in our full pipeline-based approach (MSQAP)\nproviding more accurate answers.

This\npaper proposes a new type of NMF called entropy weighted NMF (EWNMF), which\nuses an optimizable weight for each attribute of each data point to emphasize\ntheir importance.

Edges are\niteratively added or deleted according to simple local rules, modeling\ndecisions based on individual preferences and network recommendations.\nWe give theoretical bounds showing how individual edge updates affect\npolarization, and a related measure of disagreement across edges. Via\nsimulations on synthetic and real-world graphs, we find that the presence of\ntwo simple dynamics gives rise to high polarization: 1) confirmation bias --\ni.e., the preference for nodes to connect to other nodes with similar expressed\nopinions and 2) friend-of-friend link recommendations, which encourage new\nconnections between closely connected nodes. We also investigate the role of\nfixed connections which are not subject to these dynamics. We find that even a\nsmall number of fixed edges can significantly limit polarization, but still\nlead to multimodal opinion distributions, which may be considered polarized in\na different sense.",

    "abstract": "In the last decades, the development of smartphones, drones, aerial patrols,\nand digital cameras enabled high-quality photographs available to large\npopulations and, thus, provides an opportunity to collect massive data of the\nnature and society with global coverage. However, the data collected with new\nphotography tools is usually oblique - they are difficult to be georeferenced,\nand huge amounts of data is often obsolete. Georeferencing oblique imagery data\nmay be solved by a technique called monoplotting, which only requires a single\nimage and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In traditional monoplotting, a human\nuser has to manually choose a series of ground control point (GCP) pairs in the\nimage and DEM and then determine the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters of the\ncamera to establish a pixel-level correspondence between photos and the DEM to\nenable the mapping and georeferencing of objects in photos. This traditional\nmethod is difficult to scale due to several challenges including the\nlabor-intensive inputs, the need of rich experience to identify well-defined\nGCPs, and limitations in camera pose estimation. Therefore, existing\nmonoplotting methods are rarely used in analyzing large-scale databases or\nnear-real-time warning systems. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a\nnovel semi-automatic monoplotting framework that provides pixel-level\ncorrespondence between photos and DEMs requiring minimal human interventions. A\npipeline of analyses was developed including key point detection in images and\nDEM rasters, retrieving georeferenced 3D DEM GCPs, regularized gradient-based\noptimization, pose estimation, ray tracing, and the correspondence\nidentification between image pixels and real world coordinates.

It is expected to bring enormous benefits, including ultra-high\nreliability, data throughput, energy efficiency, and uniform coverage. As a\nradically distributed system, the performance of cell-free massive MIMO\ncritically relies on efficient distributed processing algorithms. In this\npaper, we propose a distributed expectation propagation (EP) detector for\ncell-free massive MIMO, which consists of two modules: a nonlinear module at\nthe central processing unit (CPU) and a linear module at each access point\n(AP). The turbo principle in iterative channel decoding is utilized to compute\nand pass the extrinsic information between the two modules.

Furthermore, a\ndistributed joint channel estimation and data detection (JCD) algorithm is\ndeveloped to handle the practical setting with imperfect channel state\ninformation (CSI). Simulation results will show that the proposed method\noutperforms existing detectors for cell-free massive MIMO systems in terms of\nthe bit-error rate and demonstrate that the developed theoretical analysis\naccurately predicts system performance.

    "abstract": "Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven their effectiveness for\nrecommender systems. Existing studies have applied GNNs to capture\ncollaborative relations in the data. However, in real-world scenarios, the\nrelations in a recommendation graph can be of various kinds. For example, two\nmovies may be associated either by the same genre or by the same\ndirector/actor. If we use a single graph to elaborate all these relations, the\ngraph can be too complex to process. To address this issue, we bring the idea\nof pre-training to process the complex graph step by step. Based on the idea of\ndivide-and-conquer, we separate the large graph into three sub-graphs: user\ngraph, item graph, and user-item interaction graph. Then the user and item\nembeddings are pre-trained from user and item graphs, respectively. To conduct\npre-training, we construct the multi-relational user graph and item graph,\nrespectively, based on their attributes. In this paper, we propose a novel\nReinforced Attentive Multi-relational Graph Neural Network (RAM-GNN) to the\npre-train user and item embeddings on the user and item graph prior to the\nrecommendation step. Specifically, we design a relation-level attention layer\nto learn the importance of different relations. Next, a Reinforced Neighbor\nSampler (RNS) is applied to search the optimal filtering threshold for sampling\ntop-k similar neighbors in the graph, which avoids the over-smoothing issue. We\ninitialize the recommendation model with the pre-trained user/item embeddings.\nFinally, an aggregation-based GNN model is utilized to learn from the\ncollaborative relations in the user-item interaction graph and provide\nrecommendations. Our experiments demonstrate that RAM-GNN outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art graph-based recommendation models and multi-relational graph\nneural networks.",

In\nthis paper a novel joint sensing and communication framework is proposed for\nenabling wireless extended reality (XR) at terahertz (THz) bands. To gather\nrich sensing information and a higher line-of-sight (LoS) availability,\nTHz-operated reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) acting as base stations\nare deployed. The sensing parameters are extracted by leveraging THz's\nquasi-opticality and opportunistically utilizing uplink communication\nwaveforms. This enables the use of the same waveform, spectrum, and hardware\nfor both sensing and communication purposes. The environmental sensing\nparameters are then derived by exploiting the sparsity of THz channels via\ntensor decomposition. Hence, a high-resolution indoor mapping is derived so as\nto characterize the spatial availability of communications and the mobility of\nusers. Simulation results show that in the proposed framework, the resolution\nand data rate of the overall system are positively correlated, thus allowing a\njoint optimization between these metrics with no tradeoffs. Results also show\nthat the proposed framework improves the system reliability in static and\nmobile systems. In particular, the highest reliability gains of 10% in\nreliability are achieved in a walking speed mobile environment compared to\ncommunication only systems with beam tracking.",

Nevertheless,\nimplementing those computation and memory-intensive intelligent algorithms on\nEH devices is extremely difficult due to the challenges of limited resources\nand intermittent power supply that causes frequent failures. To address those\nchallenges, this paper proposes a methodology that enables super-fast deep\nlearning with low-energy accelerators for tiny energy harvesting devices. We\nfirst propose RAD, a resource-aware structured DNN training framework, which\nemploys block circulant matrix with ADMM to achieve high compression and model\nquantization for leveraging the advantage of various vector operation\naccelerators. A DNN implementation method, ACE, is then proposed that employs\nlow-energy accelerators to profit maximum performance with minor energy\nconsumption. Finally, we further design FLEX, the system support for\nintermittent computation in energy harvesting situations. Experimental results\nfrom three different DNN models demonstrate that RAD, ACE, and FLEX can enable\nsuper-fast and correct inference on energy harvesting devices with up to 4.26X\nruntime reduction, up to 7.7X energy reduction with higher accuracy over the\nstate-of-the-art.",

The framework is deliberately designed to be flexible so it can be\ngradually extended to all types of hardware supported security extensions in\nprocessors. The initial test suite for memory safety currently contains 160\ntest cases covering spatial and temporal safety of memory, memory access\ncontrol, pointer integrity and control-flow integrity. Each type of\nvulnerabilities and their related defenses have been individually evaluated by\none or more test cases. The test suite has been ported to three different\ninstruction set architectures (ISAs) and experimented on six different\nplatforms. We have also utilized the test suite to explore the security\nbenefits of applying different sets of compiler flags available on the latest\nGNU GCC and LLVM compilers.",

    "abstract": "This work studies the joint beamforming design problem of achieving max-min\nrate fairness in a satellite-terrestrial integrated network (STIN) where the\nsatellite provides wide coverage to multibeam multicast satellite users (SUs),\nand the terrestrial base station (BS) serves multiple cellular users (CUs) in a\ndensely populated area. Both the satellite and BS operate in the same frequency\nband. Since rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has recently emerged as a\npromising strategy for non-orthogonal transmission and robust interference\nmanagement in multi-antenna wireless networks, we present two RSMA-based STIN\nschemes, namely the coordinated scheme relying on channel state information\n(CSI) sharing and the cooperative scheme relying on CSI and data sharing. Our\nobjective is to maximize the minimum fairness rate amongst all SUs and CUs\nsubject to transmit power constraints at the satellite and the BS. A joint\nbeamforming algorithm is proposed to reformulate the original problem into an\napproximately equivalent convex one which can be iteratively solved. Moreover,\nan expectation-based robust joint beamforming algorithm is proposed against the\npractical environment when satellite channel phase uncertainties are\nconsidered. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of\nour proposed RSMA schemes for STIN, and exhibit significant performance gains\ncompared with various traditional transmission strategies.",

    "abstract": "Social reputation (e.g., likes, comments, shares, etc.) on YouTube is the\nprimary tenet to popularize channels/videos. However, the organic way to\nimprove social reputation is tedious, which often provokes content creators to\nseek the services of online blackmarkets for rapidly inflating content\nreputation. Such blackmarkets act underneath a thriving collusive ecosystem\ncomprising core users and compromised accounts (together known as collusive\nusers). Core users form the backbone of blackmarkets; thus, spotting and\nsuspending them may help in destabilizing the entire collusive network.\nAlthough a few studies focused on collusive user detection on Twitter,\nFacebook, and YouTube, none of them differentiate between core users and\ncompromised accounts.\nWe are the first to present a rigorous analysis of core users in YouTube\nblackmarkets. To this end, we collect a new dataset of collusive YouTube users.\nWe study the core-periphery structure of the underlying collusive commenting\nnetwork (CCN). We examine the topology of CCN to explore the behavioral\ndynamics of core and compromised users. We then introduce KORSE, a novel\ngraph-based method to automatically detect core users based only on the\ntopological structure of CCN. KORSE performs a weighted k-core decomposition\nusing our proposed metric, called Weighted Internal Core Collusive Index\n(WICCI). However, KORSE is infeasible to adopt in practice as it requires\ncomplete interactions among collusive users to construct CCN. We, therefore,\npropose NURSE, a deep fusion framework that only leverages user timelines\n(without considering the underlying CCN) to detect core blackmarket users.\nExperimental results show that NURSE is quite close to KORSE in detecting core\nusers and outperforms nine baselines.",

We propose a Multicriteria technique that allows\nto control the feature effects on the model's outcome by injecting knowledge in\nthe objective function. We then extend the technique by including a non-linear\nknowledge function to account for more complex effects and local lack of\nknowledge.

The\neffects of heat flow memory and heat capacity memory (internal energy) in\nsolids are considered in first-order integrodifferential evolutionary equations\nwith difference-type kernels. The main difficulties in applying such nonlocal\nin-time mathematical models are associated with the need to work with a\nsolution throughout the entire history of the process. The paper develops an\napproach to transforming a nonlocal problem into a computationally simpler\nlocal problem for a system of first-order evolution equations. Such a\ntransition is applicable for heat conduction problems with memory if the\nrelaxation functions of the heat flux and heat capacity are represented as a\nsum of exponentials. The correctness of the auxiliary linear problem is ensured\nby the obtained estimates of the stability of the solution concerning the\ninitial data and the right-hand side in the corresponding Hilbert spaces.

    "abstract": "Today's communication networks have stringent availability requirements and\nhence need to rapidly restore connectivity after failures. Modern networks thus\nimplement various forms of fast reroute mechanisms in the data plane, to bridge\nthe gap to slow global control plane convergence. State-of-the-art fast reroute\ncommonly relies on disjoint route structures, to offer multiple independent\npaths to the destination. We propose to leverage the network's path diversity\nto extend edge disjoint path mechanisms to tree routing, in order to improve\nthe performance of fast rerouting. We present two such tree-mechanisms in\ndetail and show that they boost resilience by up to 12% and 25% respectively on\nreal-world, synthetic, and data center topologies, while still retaining good\npath length qualities.",

    "abstract": "The air that surrounds us is the cardinal source of respiration of all\nlife-forms. Therefore, it is undoubtedly vital to highlight that balanced air\nquality is utmost important to the respiratory health of all living beings,\nenvironmental homeostasis, and even economical equilibrium. Nevertheless, a\ngradual deterioration of air quality has been observed in the last few decades,\ndue to the continuous increment of polluted emissions from automobiles and\nindustries into the atmosphere. Even though many people have scarcely\nacknowledged the depth of the problem, the persistent efforts of determined\nparties, including the World Health Organization, have consistently pushed the\nboundaries for a qualitatively better global air homeostasis, by facilitating\ntechnology-driven initiatives to timely detect and predict air quality in\nregional and global scales. However, the existing frameworks for air quality\nmonitoring lack the capability of real-time responsiveness and flexible\nsemantic distribution. In this paper, a novel Internet of Things framework is\nproposed which is easily implementable, semantically distributive, and\nempowered by a machine learning model. The proposed system is equipped with a\nNodeRED dashboard which processes, visualizes, and stores the primary sensor\ndata that are acquired through a public air quality sensor network, and\nfurther, the dashboard is integrated with a machine-learning model to obtain\ntemporal and geo-spatial air quality predictions. ESP8266 NodeMCU is\nincorporated as a subscriber to the NodeRED dashboard via a message queuing\ntelemetry transport broker to communicate quantitative air quality data or\nalarming emails to the end-users through the developed web and mobile\napplications. Therefore, the proposed system could become highly beneficial in\nempowering public engagement in air quality through an unoppressive,\ndata-driven, and semantic framework.",

Taking into account the practical\nfinite self-interference (SI) and the non-linear EH model, we formulate the\nweighted sum throughput maximization optimization problem by jointly optimizing\nDL/UL time allocation, precoding matrices at devices, transmit covariance\nmatrices at the HAP, and phase shifts at the IRS. Since the resulting\noptimization problem is non-convex, there are no standard methods to solve it\noptimally in general. To tackle this challenge, we first propose an\nelement-wise (EW) based algorithm, where each IRS phase shift is alternately\noptimized in an iterative manner. To reduce the computational complexity, a\nminimum mean-square error (MMSE) based algorithm is proposed, where we\ntransform the original problem into an equivalent form based on the MMSE\nmethod, which facilities the design of an efficient iterative algorithm. In\nparticular, the IRS phase shift optimization problem is recast as an\nsecond-order cone program (SOCP), where all the IRS phase shifts are\nsimultaneously optimized. For comparison, we also study two suboptimal IRS\nbeamforming configurations in simulations, namely partially dynamic IRS\nbeamforming (PDBF) and static IRS beamforming (SBF), which strike a balance\nbetween the system performance and practical complexity.",

    "abstract": "The focus of this paper is on the problem of image retrieval with attribute\nmanipulation. Our proposed work is able to manipulate the desired attributes of\nthe query image while maintaining its other attributes. For example, the collar\nattribute of the query image can be changed from round to v-neck to retrieve\nsimilar images from a large dataset. A key challenge in e-commerce is that\nimages have multiple attributes where users would like to manipulate and it is\nimportant to estimate discriminative feature representations for each of these\nattributes. The proposed FashionSearchNet-v2 architecture is able to learn\nattribute specific representations by leveraging on its weakly-supervised\nlocalization module, which ignores the unrelated features of attributes in the\nfeature space, thus improving the similarity learning. The network is jointly\ntrained with the combination of attribute classification and triplet ranking\nloss to estimate local representations. These local representations are then\nmerged into a single global representation based on the instructed attribute\nmanipulation where desired images can be retrieved with a distance metric. The\nproposed method also provides explainability for its retrieval process to help\nprovide additional information on the attention of the network. Experiments\nperformed on several datasets that are rich in terms of the number of\nattributes show that FashionSearchNet-v2 outperforms the other state-of-the-art\nattribute manipulation techniques.

We\nstudy the computational complexity of computing its normalizing constant, which\nis among the most essential probabilistic inference tasks. Our\ncomplexity-theoretic results (almost) rule out the existence of efficient\nalgorithms for this task unless the input matrices are forced to have favorable\nstructures.

In Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), ML can for example\nbe used to optimize systems, to detect anomalies or to identify root causes of\nsystem failures. However, existing algorithms suffer from two major drawbacks:\n(i) They are hard to interpret by human experts. (ii) Transferring results from\none systems to another (similar) system is often a challenge. Concept learning,\nor Representation Learning (RepL), is a solution to both of these drawbacks;\nmimicking the human solution approach to explain-ability and transfer-ability:\nBy learning general concepts such as physical quantities or system states, the\nmodel becomes interpretable by humans. Furthermore concepts on this abstract\nlevel can normally be applied to a wide range of different systems. Modern ML\nmethods are already widely used in CPS, but concept learning and transfer\nlearning are hardly used so far. In this paper, we provide an overview of the\ncurrent state of research regarding methods for learning physical concepts in\ntime series data, which is the primary form of sensor data of CPS. We also\nanalyze the most important methods from the current state of the art using the\nexample of a three-tank system.

Several\napproaches exist that make CNNs equivariant under other transformation groups\nby design. Among these, steerable CNNs have been especially effective. However,\nthese approaches require redesigning standard networks with filters mapped from\ncombinations of predefined basis involving complex analytical functions. We\nexperimentally demonstrate that these restrictions in the choice of basis can\nlead to model weights that are sub-optimal for the primary deep learning task\n(e.g. classification). Moreover, such hard-baked explicit formulations make it\ndifficult to design composite networks comprising heterogeneous feature groups.\nTo circumvent such issues, we propose Implicitly Equivariant Networks (IEN)\nwhich induce equivariance in the different layers of a standard CNN model by\noptimizing a multi-objective loss function that combines the primary loss with\nan equivariance loss term. Through experiments with VGG and ResNet models on\nRot-MNIST , Rot-TinyImageNet, Scale-MNIST and STL-10 datasets, we show that\nIEN, even with its simple formulation, performs better than steerable networks.\nAlso, IEN facilitates construction of heterogeneous filter groups allowing\nreduction in number of channels in CNNs by a factor of over 30% while\nmaintaining performance on par with baselines. The efficacy of IEN is further\nvalidated on the hard problem of visual object tracking.

In this\ncontext, intelligent unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be occasionally\ndeployed to ensure the surveillance of these activities, that health\nrestriction measures are applied, and to trigger alerts when the latter are not\nrespected. Consequently, we propose in this paper a complete UAV framework for\nintelligent monitoring of post COVID-19 outdoor activities. Specifically, we\npropose a three steps approach. In the first step, captured images by a UAV are\nanalyzed using machine learning to detect and locate individuals. The second\nstep consists of a novel coordinates mapping approach to evaluate distances\namong individuals, then cluster them, while the third step provides an\nenergy-efficient and/or reliable UAV trajectory to inspect clusters for\nrestrictions violation such as mask wearing. Obtained results provide the\nfollowing insights: 1) Efficient detection of individuals depends on the angle\nfrom which the image was captured, 2) coordinates mapping is very sensitive to\nthe estimation error in individuals' bounding boxes, and 3) UAV trajectory\ndesign algorithm 2-Opt is recommended for practical real-time deployments due\nto its low-complexity and near-optimal performance.",

In\nthis work, we adopt the centralized training with decentralized execution\nparadigm and investigate the generalization and transfer capacity of the\ntrained models across variable number of agents. This capacity is assessed by\ntraining variable number of agents in a specific MARL problem and then\nperforming greedy evaluations with variable number of agents for each training\nconfiguration. Thus, we analyze the evaluation performance for each combination\nof agent count for training versus evaluation. We perform experimental\nevaluations on predator prey and traffic junction environments and demonstrate\nthat it is possible to obtain similar or higher evaluation performance by\ntraining with less agents. We conclude that optimal number of agents to perform\ntraining may differ from the target number of agents and argue that transfer\nacross large number of agents can be a more efficient solution to scaling up\nthan directly increasing number of agents during training.",

    "title": "Make an Omelette with Breaking Eggs: Zero-Shot Learning for Novel  Attribute Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Most of the existing algorithms for zero-shot classification problems\ntypically rely on the attribute-based semantic relations among categories to\nrealize the classification of novel categories without observing any of their\ninstances. However, training the zero-shot classification models still requires\nattribute labeling for each class (or even instance) in the training dataset,\nwhich is also expensive. To this end, in this paper, we bring up a new problem\nscenario: \"Are we able to derive zero-shot learning for novel attribute\ndetectors/classifiers and use them to automatically annotate the dataset for\nlabeling efficiency?\" Basically, given only a small set of detectors that are\nlearned to recognize some manually annotated attributes (i.e., the seen\nattributes), we aim to synthesize the detectors of novel attributes in a\nzero-shot learning manner. Our proposed method, Zero Shot Learning for\nAttributes (ZSLA), which is the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge,\ntackles this new research problem by applying the set operations to first\ndecompose the seen attributes into their basic attributes and then recombine\nthese basic attributes into the novel ones. Extensive experiments are conducted\nto verify the capacity of our synthesized detectors for accurately capturing\nthe semantics of the novel attributes and show their superior performance in\nterms of detection and localization compared to other baseline approaches.\nMoreover, with using only 32 seen attributes on the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011\ndataset, our proposed method is able to synthesize other 207 novel attributes,\nwhile various generalized zero-shot classification algorithms trained upon the\ndataset re-annotated by our synthesized attribute detectors are able to provide\ncomparable performance with those trained with the manual ground-truth\nannotations.",

By treating code as a series of interdependent events\nthat occur continuously, we design a model namely EDAM to encode code semantic\ninformation based on event embedding and event dependency.

    "abstract": "Deepfake is content or material that is synthetically generated or\nmanipulated using artificial intelligence (AI) methods, to be passed off as\nreal and can include audio, video, image, and text synthesis. This survey has\nbeen conducted with a different perspective compared to existing survey papers,\nthat mostly focus on just video and image deepfakes. This survey not only\nevaluates generation and detection methods in the different deepfake\ncategories, but mainly focuses on audio deepfakes that are overlooked in most\nof the existing surveys. This paper critically analyzes and provides a unique\nsource of audio deepfake research, mostly ranging from 2016 to 2020. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first survey focusing on audio deepfakes in\nEnglish. This survey provides readers with a summary of 1) different deepfake\ncategories 2) how they could be created and detected 3) the most recent trends\nin this domain and shortcomings in detection methods 4) audio deepfakes, how\nthey are created and detected in more detail which is the main focus of this\npaper. We found that Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN), Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNN), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are common ways of creating and\ndetecting deepfakes. In our evaluation of over 140 methods we found that the\nmajority of the focus is on video deepfakes and in particular in the generation\nof video deepfakes. We found that for text deepfakes there are more generation\nmethods but very few robust methods for detection, including fake news\ndetection, which has become a controversial area of research because of the\npotential of heavy overlaps with human generation of fake content.

    "abstract": "Weak $\\omega$-categories are notoriously difficult to define because of the\nvery intricate nature of their axioms. Various approaches have been explored,\nbased on different shapes given to the cells. Interestingly, homotopy type\ntheory encompasses a definition of weak $\\omega$-groupoid in a globular\nsetting, since every type carries such a structure. Starting from this remark,\nBrunerie could extract this definition of globular weak\n$\\omega$\\nobreakdash-groupoids, formulated as a type theory. By refining its\nrules, Finster and Mimram have then defined a type theory called CaTT, whose\nmodels are weak $\\omega$-categories. Here, we generalize this approach to\nmonoidal weak $\\omega$-categories. Based on the principle that they should be\nequivalent to weak $\\omega$-categories with only one $0$-cell, we are able to\nderive a type theory MCaTT whose models are monoidal categories. This requires\nchanging the rules of the theory in order to encode the information carried by\nthe unique $0$-cell. The correctness of the resulting type theory is shown by\ndefining a pair of translations between our type theory MCaTT and the type\ntheory CaTT. Our main contribution is to show that these translations relate\nthe models of our type theory to the models of the type theory CaTT consisting\nof $\\omega$-categories with only one $0$-cell, by analyzing in details how the\nnotion of models interact with the structural rules of both type theories.",

Our experimental results under different controls are consistent\nwith the observation in studies of human graphical conventions. Of note, we\nfind that evolved sketches can preserve the continuum of semantics under proper\nenvironmental pressures.

A recently introduced Predicting\nGeneralization in Deep Learning competition aims to encourage discovery of\nmethods to better predict test error. The current paper investigates a simple\nidea: can test error be predicted using 'synthetic data' produced using a\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN) that was trained on the same training\ndataset? Upon investigating several GAN models and architectures, we find that\nthis turns out to be the case. In fact, using GANs pre-trained on standard\ndatasets, the test error can be predicted without requiring any additional\nhyper-parameter tuning. This result is surprising because GANs have well-known\nlimitations (e.g. mode collapse) and are known to not learn the data\ndistribution accurately. Yet the generated samples are good enough to\nsubstitute for test data. Several additional experiments are presented to\nexplore reasons why GANs do well at this task.

    "abstract": "Intelligent edge devices with built-in processors vary widely in terms of\ncapability and physical form to perform advanced Computer Vision (CV) tasks\nsuch as image classification and object detection, for example. With constant\nadvances in the field of autonomous cars and UAVs, embedded systems and mobile\ndevices, there has been an ever-growing demand for extremely efficient\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANN) for real-time inference on these smart edge\ndevices with constrained computational resources. With unreliable network\nconnections in remote regions and an added complexity of data transmission, it\nis of an utmost importance to capture and process data locally instead of\nsending the data to cloud servers for remote processing. Edge devices on the\nother hand, offer limited processing power due to their inexpensive hardware,\nand limited cooling and computational resources. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel deep convolutional neural network architecture called EffCNet which is an\nimproved and an efficient version of CondenseNet Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) for edge devices utilizing self-querying data augmentation and depthwise\nseparable convolutional strategies to improve real-time inference performance\nas well as reduce the final trained model size, trainable parameters, and\nFloating-Point Operations (FLOPs) of EffCNet CNN. Furthermore, extensive\nsupervised image classification analyses are conducted on two benchmarking\ndatasets: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, to verify real-time inference performance of\nour proposed CNN. Finally, we deploy these trained weights on NXP BlueBox which\nis an intelligent edge development platform designed for self-driving vehicles\nand UAVs, and conclusions will be extrapolated accordingly.",

    "abstract": "In iterated games, a player can unilaterally exert influence over the outcome\nthrough a careful choice of strategy. A powerful class of such \"payoff control\"\nstrategies was discovered by Press and Dyson in 2012. Their so-called\n\"zero-determinant\" (ZD) strategies allow a player to unilaterally enforce a\nlinear relationship between both players' payoffs. It was subsequently shown\nthat when the slope of this linear relationship is positive, ZD strategies are\nrobustly effective against a selfishly optimizing co-player, in that all\nadapting paths of the selfish player lead to the maximal payoffs for both\nplayers (at least when there are certain restrictions on the game parameters).\nIn this paper, we investigate the efficacy of selfish learning against a fixed\nplayer in more general settings, for both ZD and non-ZD strategies. We first\nprove that in any symmetric 2x2 game, the selfish player's final strategy must\nbe of a certain form and cannot be fully stochastic. We then show that there\nare prisoner's dilemma interactions for which the robustness result does not\nhold when one player uses a fixed ZD strategy with positive slope. We give\nexamples of selfish adapting paths that lead to locally but not globally\noptimal payoffs, undermining the robustness of payoff control strategies. For\nnon-ZD strategies, these pathologies arise regardless of the original\nrestrictions on the game parameters. Our results illuminate the difficulty of\nimplementing robust payoff control and selfish optimization, even in the\nsimplest context of playing against a fixed strategy.",

There is a plethora of previous works on the performance tuning\nof systolic arrays, but usually based on a number of oversimplified assumptions\n(e.g., only considering divisors for loop tiling, pruning based on off-chip\ndata communication) to reduce the design space.\nIn this paper, we present a comprehensive design space exploration tool named\nOdyssey for systolic array optimization. Odyssey does not rely on artificial\nassumptions to limit the design space, and yet it is highly efficient and\nscalable with a hybrid optimization technique. For example, for a\n1024x1024x1024 matrix multiplication, it finds designs that reach 90% of the\noptimal performance in 5 seconds with a single CPU thread. Moreover, using\nOdyssey, we unveil and quantify the suboptimality introduced by multiple\ncommonly used oversimplifications in prior studies for systolic array design\nspace exploration. For example, Odyssey results show that limiting to divisors\nfor loop tiling leads to a 39% performance loss, and pruning based on off-chip\ndata movement results in a 45% performance loss.

    "abstract": "With the fast development of deep neural networks (DNNs), many real-world\napplications are adopting multiple models to conduct compound tasks, such as\nco-running classification, detection, and segmentation models on autonomous\nvehicles. Such multi-tenant DNN inference cases greatly exacerbate the\ncomputational complexity and call for comprehensive collaboration for\ngraph-level operator scheduling, runtime-level resource awareness, as well as\nhardware scheduler support. However, the current scheduling support for such\nmulti-tenant inference is still relatively backward. In this work, we propose a\nresource-aware scheduling framework for efficient multi-tenant DNN inference on\nGPU, which automatically coordinates DNN computing in different execution\nlevels. Leveraging the unified scheduling intermediate representation and the\nautomated ML-based searching algorithm, optimal schedules could be generated to\nwisely adjust model concurrency and interleave DNN model operators, maintaining\na continuously balanced resource utilization across the entire inference\nprocess, and eventually improving the runtime efficiency. Experiments show that\nwe could consistently achieve 1.3-1.7x speed-up, compared to regular DNN\nruntime libraries (e.g., CuDNN, TVM) and particular concurrent scheduling\nmethods (e.g., NVIDIA Multi-Stream).",

The weak\nformulation includes least-squares terms arising from the constitutive equation\nand from the incompressibility condition, and we use a fixed point strategies\nto show the existence and uniqueness of continuous and discrete solutions under\nthe assumption of sufficiently small data. The method is constructed using any\ncompatible finite element pair (conforming or non-conforming) for velocity and\npressure as dictated by Stokes inf-sup stability, while for vorticity any\ngeneric discrete space (of arbitrary order) can be used. We establish optimal a\npriori error estimates. Finally, we provide a set of numerical tests in 2D and\n3D illustrating the behaviour of the scheme as well as verifying the\ntheoretical convergence rates.",

In applications, an\noff-the-shelf grid needs to be restructured to have higher grid density in some\nregions than others. This should be done in a way that avoids tangling, hence,\nthe attractiveness of diffeomorphic mapping techniques. For exact diffeomorphic\nmapping on the sphere a major tool used is Optimal Transport, which allows for\ndiffeomorphic mapping between even non-continuous source and target densities.\nHowever, recently Optimal Information Transport was rigorously developed\nallowing for exact and inexact diffeomorphic mapping and the solving of a\nsimpler partial differential equation.\nIn this manuscript, we solve adaptive mesh problems using Optimal Transport\nand Optimal Information Transport on the sphere and introduce how to generalize\nthese computations to more general manifolds. We choose to perform this\ncomparison with provably convergent solvers, which is generally challenging for\neither problem due to the lack of boundary conditions and lack of comparison\nprinciple in the partial differential equation formulation.",

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has gained considerable attention recently for\n3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis due to its remarkable\nsynthesis quality. However, image blurriness caused by defocus or motion, which\noften occurs when capturing scenes in the wild, significantly degrades its\nreconstruction quality. To address this problem, We propose Deblur-NeRF, the\nfirst method that can recover a sharp NeRF from blurry input. We adopt an\nanalysis-by-synthesis approach that reconstructs blurry views by simulating the\nblurring process, thus making NeRF robust to blurry inputs. The core of this\nsimulation is a novel Deformable Sparse Kernel (DSK) module that models\nspatially-varying blur kernels by deforming a canonical sparse kernel at each\nspatial location. The ray origin of each kernel point is jointly optimized,\ninspired by the physical blurring process. This module is parameterized as an\nMLP that has the ability to be generalized to various blur types. Jointly\noptimizing the NeRF and the DSK module allows us to restore a sharp NeRF. We\ndemonstrate that our method can be used on both camera motion blur and defocus\nblur: the two most common types of blur in real scenes. Evaluation results on\nboth synthetic and real-world data show that our method outperforms several\nbaselines.

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving has made great progress and been introduced in practical\nuse step by step. On the other hand, the concept of personal mobility is also\ngetting popular, and its autonomous driving specialized for individual drivers\nis expected for a new step. However, it is difficult to collect a large driving\ndataset, which is basically required for the learning of autonomous driving,\nfrom the individual driver of the personal mobility. In addition, when the\ndriver is not familiar with the operation of the personal mobility, the dataset\nwill contain non-optimal data. This study therefore focuses on an autonomous\ndriving method for the personal mobility with such a small and noisy, so-called\npersonal, dataset. Specifically, we introduce a new loss function based on\nTsallis statistics that weights gradients depending on the original loss\nfunction and allows us to exclude noisy data in the optimization phase. In\naddition, we improve the visualization technique to verify whether the driver\nand the controller have the same region of interest. From the experimental\nresults, we found that the conventional autonomous driving failed to drive\nproperly due to the wrong operations in the personal dataset, and the region of\ninterest was different from that of the driver. In contrast, the proposed\nmethod learned robustly against the errors and successfully drove automatically\nwhile paying attention to the similar region to the driver.

The second element provides means to\nselect promising regions to explore (and cover) using the minimization of a\ncost function involving the agent's relative position to the frontier cells and\nthe frontier's size. We tested our approach's performance on both heterogeneous\nand homogeneous groups of mobile robots in different environments.

However, deep learning-driven visual\ninspection methods often necessitate significant computational resources, thus\nlimiting throughput and act as a bottleneck to widespread adoption for enabling\nsmart factories. In this study, we investigated the utilization of a\nmachine-driven design exploration approach to create TinyDefectNet, a highly\ncompact deep convolutional network architecture tailored for high-throughput\nmanufacturing visual quality inspection. TinyDefectNet comprises of just ~427K\nparameters and has a computational complexity of ~97M FLOPs, yet achieving a\ndetection accuracy of a state-of-the-art architecture for the task of surface\ndefect detection on the NEU defect benchmark dataset. As such, TinyDefectNet\ncan achieve the same level of detection performance at 52$\\times$ lower\narchitectural complexity and 11x lower computational complexity. Furthermore,\nTinyDefectNet was deployed on an AMD EPYC 7R32, and achieved 7.6x faster\nthroughput using the native Tensorflow environment and 9x faster throughput\nusing AMD ZenDNN accelerator library. Finally, explainability-driven\nperformance validation strategy was conducted to ensure correct decision-making\nbehaviour was exhibited by TinyDefectNet to improve trust in its usage by\noperators and inspectors.",

    "abstract": "DETR is the first end-to-end object detector using a transformer\nencoder-decoder architecture and demonstrates competitive performance but low\ncomputational efficiency on high resolution feature maps. The subsequent work,\nDeformable DETR, enhances the efficiency of DETR by replacing dense attention\nwith deformable attention, which achieves 10x faster convergence and improved\nperformance. Deformable DETR uses the multiscale feature to ameliorate\nperformance, however, the number of encoder tokens increases by 20x compared to\nDETR, and the computation cost of the encoder attention remains a bottleneck.\nIn our preliminary experiment, we observe that the detection performance hardly\ndeteriorates even if only a part of the encoder token is updated. Inspired by\nthis observation, we propose Sparse DETR that selectively updates only the\ntokens expected to be referenced by the decoder, thus help the model\neffectively detect objects. In addition, we show that applying an auxiliary\ndetection loss on the selected tokens in the encoder improves the performance\nwhile minimizing computational overhead. We validate that Sparse DETR achieves\nbetter performance than Deformable DETR even with only 10% encoder tokens on\nthe COCO dataset. Albeit only the encoder tokens are sparsified, the total\ncomputation cost decreases by 38% and the frames per second (FPS) increases by\n42% compared to Deformable DETR.\nCode is available at https://github.com/kakaobrain/sparse-detr",

However, prediction error is only\none possible prioritization metric. Recent work in neuroscience suggests that,\nin biological organisms, replay is prioritized by both gain and need. The need\nterm measures the expected relevance of each experience with respect to the\ncurrent situation, and more importantly, this term is not currently considered\nin algorithms such as deep Q-network (DQN). Thus, in this paper we present a\nnew approach for prioritizing experiences for replay that considers both gain\nand need.

    "abstract": "Enhancing the robustness in real-world scenarios has been proven very\nchallenging. One reason is that existing robustness benchmarks are limited, as\nthey either rely on synthetic data or they simply measure robustness as\ngeneralization between datasets and hence ignore the effects of individual\nnuisance factors. In this work, we introduce ROBIN, a benchmark dataset for\ndiagnosing the robustness of vision algorithms to individual nuisances in\nreal-world images. ROBIN builds on 10 rigid categories from the PASCAL VOC 2012\nand ImageNet datasets and includes out-of-distribution examples of the objects\n3D pose, shape, texture, context and weather conditions. ROBIN is richly\nannotated to enable benchmark models for image classification, object\ndetection, and 3D pose estimation. We provide results for a number of popular\nbaselines and make several interesting observations: 1. Some nuisance factors\nhave a much stronger negative effect on the performance compared to others.\nMoreover, the negative effect of an OODnuisance depends on the downstream\nvision task. 2. Current approaches to enhance OOD robustness using strong data\naugmentation have only marginal effects in real-world OOD scenarios, and\nsometimes even reduce the OOD performance. 3. We do not observe any significant\ndifferences between convolutional and transformer architectures in terms of OOD\nrobustness. We believe our dataset provides a rich testbed to study the OOD\nrobustness of vision algorithms and will help to significantly push forward\nresearch in this area.",

    "abstract": "As a promising distributed machine learning paradigm, Federated Learning (FL)\ntrains a central model with decentralized data without compromising user\nprivacy, which has made it widely used by Artificial Intelligence Internet of\nThings (AIoT) applications. However, the traditional FL suffers from model\ninaccuracy since it trains local models using hard labels of data and ignores\nuseful information of incorrect predictions with small probabilities. Although\nvarious solutions try to tackle the bottleneck of the traditional FL, most of\nthem introduce significant communication and memory overhead, making the\ndeployment of large-scale AIoT devices a great challenge. To address the above\nproblem, this paper presents a novel Distillation-based Federated Learning\n(DFL) architecture that enables efficient and accurate FL for AIoT\napplications. Inspired by Knowledge Distillation (KD) that can increase the\nmodel accuracy, our approach adds the soft targets used by KD to the FL model\ntraining, which occupies negligible network resources. The soft targets are\ngenerated by local sample predictions of each AIoT device after each round of\nlocal training and used for the next round of model training. During the local\ntraining of DFL, both soft targets and hard labels are used as approximation\nobjectives of model predictions to improve model accuracy by supplementing the\nknowledge of soft targets. To further improve the performance of our DFL model,\nwe design a dynamic adjustment strategy for tuning the ratio of two loss\nfunctions used in KD, which can maximize the use of both soft targets and hard\nlabels.

We assume that a non-parametric Markovian causal model\nrepresentative of the data generation procedure is given. The edges emanating\nfrom the sensitive nodes in the causal graph, such as race, are assumed to be\nthe sources of unfairness. We first quantify Edge Flow in any edge X -> Y,\nwhich is the belief of observing a specific value of Y due to the influence of\na specific value of X along X -> Y. We then quantify Edge Unfairness by\nformulating a non-parametric model in terms of edge flows. We then prove that\ncumulative unfairness towards sensitive groups in a decision, like race in a\nbail decision, is non-existent when edge unfairness is absent. We prove this\nresult for the non-trivial non-parametric model setting when the cumulative\nunfairness cannot be expressed in terms of edge unfairness. We then measure the\nPotential to mitigate the Cumulative Unfairness when edge unfairness is\ndecreased. Based on these measurements, we propose the Unfair Edge\nPrioritization algorithm that can then be used by policymakers.

Furthermore, our method leverages past learning experience to\nderive surrogate gradient to guide and accelerate the exploration process in\ntraining.

In this paper, we propose a pair-based SSDA method\nthat adapts a model to the target domain using self-distillation with sample\npairs. Each sample pair is composed of a teacher sample from a labeled dataset\n(i.e., source or labeled target) and its student sample from an unlabeled\ndataset (i.e., unlabeled target). Our method generates an assistant feature by\ntransferring an intermediate style between the teacher and the student, and\nthen train the model by minimizing the output discrepancy between the student\nand the assistant. During training, the assistants gradually bridge the\ndiscrepancy between the two domains, thus allowing the student to easily learn\nfrom the teacher. Experimental evaluation on standard benchmarks shows that our\nmethod effectively minimizes both the inter-domain and intra-domain\ndiscrepancies, thus achieving significant improvements over recent methods.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation has become an important approach to obtain a compact\nyet effective model. To achieve this goal, a small student model is trained to\nexploit the knowledge of a large well-trained teacher model. However, due to\nthe capacity gap between the teacher and the student, the student's performance\nis hard to reach the level of the teacher. Regarding this issue, existing\nmethods propose to reduce the difficulty of the teacher's knowledge via a proxy\nway. We argue that these proxy-based methods overlook the knowledge loss of the\nteacher, which may cause the student to encounter capacity bottlenecks. In this\npaper, we alleviate the capacity gap problem from a new perspective with the\npurpose of averting knowledge loss. Instead of sacrificing part of the\nteacher's knowledge, we propose to build a more powerful student via\nadversarial collaborative learning. To this end, we further propose an\nAdversarial Collaborative Knowledge Distillation (ACKD) method that effectively\nimproves the performance of knowledge distillation. Specifically, we construct\nthe student model with multiple auxiliary learners. Meanwhile, we devise an\nadversarial collaborative module (ACM) that introduces attention mechanism and\nadversarial learning to enhance the capacity of the student.

    "abstract": "The lack of large-scale noisy-clean image pairs restricts supervised\ndenoising methods' deployment in actual applications. While existing\nunsupervised methods are able to learn image denoising without ground-truth\nclean images, they either show poor performance or work under impractical\nsettings (e.g., paired noisy images). In this paper, we present a practical\nunsupervised image denoising method to achieve state-of-the-art denoising\nperformance. Our method only requires single noisy images and a noise model,\nwhich is easily accessible in practical raw image denoising. It performs two\nsteps iteratively: (1) Constructing a noisier-noisy dataset with random noise\nfrom the noise model; (2) training a model on the noisier-noisy dataset and\nusing the trained model to refine noisy images to obtain the targets used in\nthe next round. We further approximate our full iterative method with a fast\nalgorithm for more efficient training while keeping its original high\nperformance. Experiments on real-world, synthetic, and correlated noise show\nthat our proposed unsupervised denoising approach has superior performances\nover existing unsupervised methods and competitive performance with supervised\nmethods. In addition, we argue that existing denoising datasets are of low\nquality and contain only a small number of scenes. To evaluate raw image\ndenoising performance in real-world applications, we build a high-quality raw\nimage dataset SenseNoise-500 that contains 500 real-life scenes. The dataset\ncan serve as a strong benchmark for better evaluating raw image denoising. Code\nand dataset will be released at https://github.com/zhangyi-3/IDR",

Technology is critical to DVI by enabling the linkage of physical\nevidence to information. However, labelling physical remains and collecting\ndata at the scene are dominated by low-technology paper-based practices. We\nask, how can technology help us tag and track the victims of disaster? Our\nresponse has two parts. First, we conducted a human-computer interaction led\ninvestigation into the systematic factors impacting DVI tagging and tracking\nprocesses. Through interviews with Australian DVI practitioners, we explored\nhow technologies to improve linkage might fit with prevailing work practices\nand preferences; practical and social considerations; and existing systems and\nprocesses. Using insights from these interviews and relevant literature, we\nidentified four critical themes: protocols and training; stress and stressors;\nthe plurality of information capture and management systems; and practicalities\nand constraints. Second, we applied the themes identified in the first part of\nthe investigation to critically review technologies that could support DVI\npractitioners by enhancing DVI processes that link physical evidence to\ninformation. This resulted in an overview of candidate technologies matched\nwith consideration of their key attributes. This study recognises the\nimportance of considering human factors that can affect technology adoption\ninto existing practices.

    "abstract": "In the past decade, we have witnessed the rise of deep learning to dominate\nthe field of artificial intelligence. Advances in artificial neural networks\nalongside corresponding advances in hardware accelerators with large memory\ncapacity, together with the availability of large datasets enabled researchers\nand practitioners alike to train and deploy sophisticated neural network models\nthat achieve state-of-the-art performance on tasks across several fields\nspanning computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement\nlearning. However, as these neural networks become bigger, more complex, and\nmore widely used, fundamental problems with current deep learning models become\nmore apparent. State-of-the-art deep learning models are known to suffer from\nissues that range from poor robustness, inability to adapt to novel task\nsettings, to requiring rigid and inflexible configuration assumptions. Ideas\nfrom collective intelligence, in particular concepts from complex systems such\nas self-organization, emergent behavior, swarm optimization, and cellular\nsystems tend to produce solutions that are robust, adaptable, and have less\nrigid assumptions about the environment configuration. It is therefore natural\nto see these ideas incorporated into newer deep learning methods. In this\nreview, we will provide a historical context of neural network research's\ninvolvement with complex systems, and highlight several active areas in modern\ndeep learning research that incorporate the principles of collective\nintelligence to advance its current capabilities. To facilitate a\nbi-directional flow of ideas, we also discuss work that utilize modern deep\nlearning models to help advance complex systems research.

    "abstract": "It has been well recognized that fusing the complementary information from\ndepth-aware LiDAR point clouds and semantic-rich stereo images would benefit 3D\nobject detection. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to explore the inherently\nunnatural interaction between sparse 3D points and dense 2D pixels. To ease\nthis difficulty, the recent proposals generally project the 3D points onto the\n2D image plane to sample the image data and then aggregate the data at the\npoints. However, this approach often suffers from the mismatch between the\nresolution of point clouds and RGB images, leading to sub-optimal performance.\nSpecifically, taking the sparse points as the multi-modal data aggregation\nlocations causes severe information loss for high-resolution images, which in\nturn undermines the effectiveness of multi-sensor fusion. In this paper, we\npresent VPFNet -- a new architecture that cleverly aligns and aggregates the\npoint cloud and image data at the `virtual' points. Particularly, with their\ndensity lying between that of the 3D points and 2D pixels, the virtual points\ncan nicely bridge the resolution gap between the two sensors, and thus preserve\nmore information for processing. Moreover, we also investigate the data\naugmentation techniques that can be applied to both point clouds and RGB\nimages, as the data augmentation has made non-negligible contribution towards\n3D object detectors to date. We have conducted extensive experiments on KITTI\ndataset, and have observed good performance compared to the state-of-the-art\nmethods. Remarkably, our VPFNet achieves 83.21\\% moderate 3D AP and 91.86\\%\nmoderate BEV AP on the KITTI test set, ranking the 1st since May 21th, 2021.\nThe network design also takes computation efficiency into consideration -- we\ncan achieve a FPS of 15 on a single NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti GPU.

    "abstract": "The absence of an algorithm that effectively monitors deep learning models\nused in side-channel attacks increases the difficulty of evaluation. If the\nattack is unsuccessful, the question is if we are dealing with a resistant\nimplementation or a faulty model. We propose an early stopping algorithm that\nreliably recognizes the model's optimal state during training. The novelty of\nour solution is an efficient implementation of guessing entropy estimation.\nAdditionally, we formalize two conditions, persistence and patience, for a deep\nlearning model to be optimal. As a result, the model converges with fewer\ntraces.",

Our\nmethod estimates high resolution and highly precise depth maps iteratively, by\ntraversing the continuous space of feasible depth values at each pixel in a\nbinary decision fashion.

Moreover, in order to handle occluded regions, at each\niteration the results from different source images are fused using pixelwise\nweights estimated by a second network. Thanks to the adopted binary decision\nstrategy, which permits an efficient exploration of the depth space, our method\ncan handle high resolution images without trading resolution and precision.\nThis sets it apart from most alternative learning-based Multi-View Stereo\nmethods, where the explicit discretization of the depth space requires the\nprocessing of large cost volumes.

    "abstract": "Object visual navigation aims to steer an agent towards a target object based\non visual observations of the agent. It is highly desirable to reasonably\nperceive the environment and accurately control the agent. In the navigation\ntask, we introduce an Agent-Centric Relation Graph (ACRG) for learning the\nvisual representation based on the relationships in the environment. ACRG is a\nhighly effective and reasonable structure that consists of two relationships,\ni.e., the relationship among objects and the relationship between the agent and\nthe target. On the one hand, we design the Object Horizontal Relationship Graph\n(OHRG) that stores the relative horizontal location among objects. Note that\nthe vertical relationship is not involved in OHRG, and we argue that OHRG is\nsuitable for the control strategy. On the other hand, we propose the\nAgent-Target Depth Relationship Graph (ATDRG) that enables the agent to\nperceive the distance to the target. To achieve ATDRG, we utilize image depth\nto represent the distance. Given the above relationships, the agent can\nperceive the environment and output navigation actions. Given the visual\nrepresentations constructed by ACRG and position-encoded global features, the\nagent can capture the target position to perform navigation actions.\nExperimental results in the artificial environment AI2-Thor demonstrate that\nACRG significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in unseen testing\nenvironments.",

The approach learns a list of halfspaces iteratively from\nlabeled and unlabeled training data, in which each iteration consists of two\nsteps: exploration and pruning.

This raises the problem of how to find interesting (i.e.,\npotentially hazardous) worker behaviors given a limited number of simulation\nruns. We frame this as a search problem in the space of possible worker\nbehaviors. Because this search space can get quite complex, we introduce the\nfollowing measures: (1) Search space restriction based on workflow-constraints,\n(2) prioritization of behaviors based on how far they deviate from the nominal\nbehavior, and (3) the use of a risk metric to guide the search towards\nhigh-risk behaviors which are more likely to expose hazards.

    "abstract": "The computing device deployment explosion experienced in recent years,\nmotivated by the advances of technologies such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) and\n5G, has led to a global scenario with increasing cybersecurity risks and\nthreats. Among them, device spoofing and impersonation cyberattacks stand out\ndue to their impact and, usually, low complexity required to be launched. To\nsolve this issue, several solutions have emerged to identify device models and\ntypes based on the combination of behavioral fingerprinting and Machine/Deep\nLearning (ML/DL) techniques. However, these solutions are not appropriated for\nscenarios where data privacy and protection is a must, as they require data\ncentralization for processing. In this context, newer approaches such as\nFederated Learning (FL) have not been fully explored yet, especially when\nmalicious clients are present in the scenario setup. The present work analyzes\nand compares the device model identification performance of a centralized DL\nmodel with an FL one while using execution time-based events. For experimental\npurposes, a dataset containing execution-time features of 55 Raspberry Pis\nbelonging to four different models has been collected and published. Using this\ndataset, the proposed solution achieved 0.9999 accuracy in both setups,\ncentralized and federated, showing no performance decrease while preserving\ndata privacy. Later, the impact of a label-flipping attack during the federated\nmodel training is evaluated, using several aggregation mechanisms as\ncountermeasure. Zeno and coordinate-wise median aggregation show the best\nperformance, although their performance greatly degrades when the percentage of\nfully malicious clients (all training samples poisoned) grows over 50%.",

    "title": "Decoupled Low-light Image Enhancement",
    "abstract": "The visual quality of photographs taken under imperfect lightness conditions\ncan be degenerated by multiple factors, e.g., low lightness, imaging noise,\ncolor distortion and so on. Current low-light image enhancement models focus on\nthe improvement of low lightness only, or simply deal with all the degeneration\nfactors as a whole, therefore leading to a sub-optimal performance. In this\npaper, we propose to decouple the enhancement model into two sequential stages.\nThe first stage focuses on improving the scene visibility based on a pixel-wise\nnon-linear mapping. The second stage focuses on improving the appearance\nfidelity by suppressing the rest degeneration factors. The decoupled model\nfacilitates the enhancement in two aspects. On the one hand, the whole\nlow-light enhancement can be divided into two easier subtasks. The first one\nonly aims to enhance the visibility. It also helps to bridge the large\nintensity gap between the low-light and normal-light images. In this way, the\nsecond subtask can be shaped as the local appearance adjustment. On the other\nhand, since the parameter matrix learned from the first stage is aware of the\nlightness distribution and the scene structure, it can be incorporated into the\nsecond stage as the complementary information. In the experiments, our model\ndemonstrates the state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and\nquantitative comparisons, compared with other low-light image enhancement\nmodels. In addition, the ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of\nour model in multiple aspects, such as model structure and loss function. The\ntrained model is available at\nhttps://github.com/hanxuhfut/Decoupled-Low-light-Image-Enhancement.",

    "abstract": "Transfer Optimization, understood as the exchange of information among\nsolvers to improve their performance, has gained a remarkable attention from\nthe Swarm and Evolutionary Computation community in the last years. This\nresearch area is young but grows at a fast pace, being at the core of a corpus\nof literature that expands day after day. It is undeniable that the concepts\nunderlying Transfer Optimization are formulated on solid grounds. However,\nevidences observed in recent contributions and our own experience in this field\nconfirm that there are critical aspects that are not properly addressed to\ndate. This short communication aims to engage the readership around a\nreflection on these issues, to provide rationale why they remain unsolved, and\nto call for an urgent action to overcome them fully. Specifically, we emphasize\non three critical points of Evolutionary Multitasking Optimization, which is\narguably the paradigm in Transfer Optimization that has been most actively\ninvestigated in the literature: i) the plausibility of the multitask\noptimization concept; ii) the acclaimed novelty of some proposed multitasking\nmethods relying on Evolutionary Computation and Swarm Intelligence; and iii)\nmethodologies used for evaluating newly proposed multitasking algorithms. Our\nultimate purpose with this critique is to unveil weaknesses observed in these\nthree problematic aspects, so that prospective works can avoid stumbling on the\nsame stones and eventually achieve valuable advances in the right directions.",

To this end, we model\nthe blurred appearance of a fast moving object in a generative fashion by\nparametrizing its 3D position, rotation, velocity, acceleration, bounces,\nshape, and texture over the duration of a predefined time window spanning\nmultiple frames. Using differentiable rendering, we are able to estimate all\nparameters by minimizing the pixel-wise reprojection error to the input video\nvia backpropagating through a rendering pipeline that accounts for motion blur\nby averaging the graphics output over short time intervals. For that purpose,\nwe also estimate the camera exposure gap time within the same optimization. To\naccount for abrupt motion changes like bounces, we model the motion trajectory\nas a piece-wise polynomial, and we are able to estimate the specific time of\nthe bounce at sub-frame accuracy.

Therefore, we\nconducted a two-weeks online study that started in October 2020, in which we\nanalyzed the impact of recommendations on two user groups, i.e., anonymous and\nsubscribed users, and three user interface types, i.e., on a desktop, mobile\nand tablet device.

With respect to popularity bias mitigation, we find that\npersonalized, content-based news recommendations can lead to a more balanced\ndistribution of news articles' readership popularity in the case of anonymous\nusers.

    "abstract": "Recognition of overlapped speech has been a highly challenging task to date.\nState-of-the-art multi-channel speech separation system are becoming\nincreasingly complex and expensive for practical applications. To this end,\nlow-bit neural network quantization provides a powerful solution to\ndramatically reduce their model size. However, current quantization methods are\nbased on uniform precision and fail to account for the varying performance\nsensitivity at different model components to quantization errors. In this\npaper, novel mixed precision DNN quantization methods are proposed by applying\nlocally variable bit-widths to individual TCN components of a TF masking based\nmulti-channel speech separation system. The optimal local precision settings\nare automatically learned using three techniques. The first two approaches\nutilize quantization sensitivity metrics based on either the mean square error\n(MSE) loss function curvature, or the KL-divergence measured between full\nprecision and quantized separation models. The third approach is based on mixed\nprecision neural architecture search. Experiments conducted on the LRS3-TED\ncorpus simulated overlapped speech data suggest that the proposed mixed\nprecision quantization techniques consistently outperform the uniform precision\nbaseline speech separation systems of comparable bit-widths in terms of SI-SNR\nand PESQ scores as well as word error rate (WER) reductions up to 2.88%\nabsolute (8% relative).",

Contrary to the discriminative models, which map high dimensional\ninputs to class labels, generative models are used in Variational autoencoders\n(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Extensive studies have been\ndone to improve unsupervised learning and GANs are one of the most successful\nalgorithms to come up in the domain. With the benefits of providing greater\naccuracies, GANs have been expensive in terms of energy and speed, due to the\nvast number of Vector Matrix Multiplications computed on a large weight matrix.\nTo overcome this hurdle, several works have been done on GPU and FPGA-based\naccelerators. However, the Von Neumann bottleneck limits the accuracies and\nenergy efficiency one can achieve and so Neuromorphic computing has been\nadopted greatly to exceed these limits. In this work, we have proposed an\nimplementation of GANs on passive memristor crossbar arrays. We have performed\na fixed amplitude training to update the weights with the crossbar as the\nbackend.

Among geometric primitives, superquadrics are well known for\ntheir simple implicit expressions and capability of representing a wide range\nof shapes with few parameters. However, as the first and foremost step,\nrecovering superquadrics accurately and robustly from 3D data still remains\nchallenging. The existing methods are subject to local optima and are sensitive\nto noise and outliers in real-world scenarios, resulting in frequent failure in\ncapturing geometric shapes. In this paper, we propose the first probabilistic\nmethod to recover superquadrics from point clouds. Our method builds a\nGaussian-uniform mixture model (GUM) on the parametric surface of a\nsuperquadric, which explicitly models the generation of outliers and noise. The\nsuperquadric recovery is formulated as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)\nproblem. We propose an algorithm, Expectation, Maximization, and Switching\n(EMS), to solve this problem, where: (1) outliers are predicted from the\nposterior perspective; (2) the superquadric parameter is optimized by the\ntrust-region reflective algorithm; and (3) local optima are avoided by globally\nsearching and switching among parameters encoding similar superquadrics. We\nshow that our method can be extended to the multi-superquadrics recovery for\ncomplex objects.

We present a vision and framework based on modular\nflow generators that encapsulates coarse-grain and fine-grain reusable code in\nmodular nodes and assembles them into complete flows. The key feature is a flow\nconsistency and instrumentation layer embedded in Python, which supports\nmechanisms for rapid and early feedback on inconsistent composition. The\napproach gradually types the Tcl language and allows both automatic and\nuser-annotated static assertion checks. We evaluate the design flows of\nsuccessive generations of silicon prototypes designed in TSMC16, TSMC28,\nTSMC40, SKY130, and IBM180 technologies, showing how our approach can enable\nsignificant code reuse in future flows.",

During this operation, only UAVs and cameras were used to\nobtain information about the site and the building. First, a geo-referenced 3D\nmodel of the building was created in order to plan the entry into the hall.\nSubsequently, the UAVs were used to fly in the heavily damaged interior and\ntake pictures from inside of the hall. A 360{\\deg} camera mounted under the UAV\nwas used to collect images of the surrounding area especially from sections\nthat were difficult to fly into. Since the collected data set contained similar\nimages as well as blurred images, it was cleaned from non-optimal images using\nvisual SLAM, bundle adjustment and blur detection so that a 3D model and\noverviews could be calculated. It was shown that the emergency services were\nnot able to extract the necessary information from the 3D model. Therefore, an\ninteractive panorama viewer with links to other 360{\\deg} images was\nimplemented where the links to the other images depends on the semi dense point\ncloud and located camera positions of the visual SLAM algorithm so that the\nemergency forces could view the surroundings.",

From the perspective of video understanding, a good\nVideoQA framework needs to understand the video content at different semantic\nlevels and flexibly integrate the diverse video content to distill\nquestion-related content. To this end, we propose a Lightweight\nVisual-Linguistic Reasoning framework named LiVLR.

Subsequently, the obtained\nrepresentations are integrated with the devised Diversity-aware\nVisual-Linguistic Reasoning module (DaVL). The DaVL considers the difference\nbetween the different types of representations and can flexibly adjust the\nimportance of different types of representations when generating the\nquestion-related joint representation, which is an effective and general\nrepresentation integration method.

In\npolicy evaluation, the task is to estimate the expected return of an evaluation\npolicy on an environment of interest.

We consider a setting where we can\ncollect a small amount of additional data to combine with a potentially larger\noffline RL dataset. We show that simply running the evaluation policy --\non-policy data collection -- is sub-optimal for this setting. We then introduce\ntwo new data collection strategies for policy evaluation, both of which\nconsider previously collected data when collecting future data so as to reduce\ndistribution shift (or sampling error) in the entire dataset collected. Our\nempirical results show that compared to on-policy sampling, our strategies\nproduce data with lower sampling error and generally lead to lower mean-squared\nerror in policy evaluation for any total dataset size. We also show that these\nstrategies can start from initial off-policy data, collect additional data, and\nthen use both the initial and new data to produce low mean-squared error policy\nevaluation without using off-policy corrections.",

    "abstract": "Convolution and self-attention are two powerful techniques for representation\nlearning, and they are usually considered as two peer approaches that are\ndistinct from each other. In this paper, we show that there exists a strong\nunderlying relation between them, in the sense that the bulk of computations of\nthese two paradigms are in fact done with the same operation. Specifically, we\nfirst show that a traditional convolution with kernel size k x k can be\ndecomposed into k^2 individual 1x1 convolutions, followed by shift and\nsummation operations. Then, we interpret the projections of queries, keys, and\nvalues in self-attention module as multiple 1x1 convolutions, followed by the\ncomputation of attention weights and aggregation of the values. Therefore, the\nfirst stage of both two modules comprises the similar operation. More\nimportantly, the first stage contributes a dominant computation complexity\n(square of the channel size) comparing to the second stage. This observation\nnaturally leads to an elegant integration of these two seemingly distinct\nparadigms, i.e., a mixed model that enjoys the benefit of both self-Attention\nand Convolution (ACmix), while having minimum computational overhead compared\nto the pure convolution or self-attention counterpart.

However, the defense\nmethods that have good effect in natural images may not be suitable for medical\ndiagnostic tasks. The preprocessing methods (e.g., random resizing,\ncompression) may lead to the loss of the small lesions feature in the medical\nimage. Retraining the network on the augmented data set is also not practical\nfor medical models that have already been deployed online. Accordingly, it is\nnecessary to design an easy-to-deploy and effective defense framework for\nmedical diagnostic tasks. In this paper, we propose a Robust and Retrain-Less\nDiagnostic Framework for Medical pretrained models against adversarial attack\n(i.e., MedRDF). It acts on the inference time of the pertained medical model.\nSpecifically, for each test image, MedRDF firstly creates a large number of\nnoisy copies of it, and obtains the output labels of these copies from the\npretrained medical diagnostic model. Then, based on the labels of these copies,\nMedRDF outputs the final robust diagnostic result by majority voting. In\naddition to the diagnostic result, MedRDF produces the Robust Metric (RM) as\nthe confidence of the result. Therefore, it is convenient and reliable to\nutilize MedRDF to convert pre-trained non-robust diagnostic models into robust\nones.

We introduce ShortCut that routes the packets in a loop free\nfashion, avoiding costly detours and decreasing link load. ShortCut achieves\nthis by leveraging data plane programmability: when a loop is locally observed,\nit can be removed by short-cutting the respective route parts. As such,\nShortCut is topology-independent and agnostic to the type of FRR currently\ndeployed.

    "abstract": "Recently, fairness-aware learning have become increasingly crucial, but we\nnote that most of those methods operate by assuming the availability of fully\nannotated group-labels. We emphasize that such assumption is unrealistic for\nreal-world applications since group label annotations are expensive and can\nconflict with privacy issues. In this paper, we consider a more practical\nscenario, dubbed as Algorithmic Fairness with the Partially annotated Group\nlabels (Fair-PG). We observe that the existing fairness methods, which only use\nthe data with group-labels, perform even worse than the vanilla training, which\nsimply uses full data only with target labels, under Fair-PG. To address this\nproblem, we propose a simple Confidence-based Group Label assignment (CGL)\nstrategy that is readily applicable to any fairness-aware learning method. Our\nCGL utilizes an auxiliary group classifier to assign pseudo group labels, where\nrandom labels are assigned to low confident samples. We first theoretically\nshow that our method design is better than the vanilla pseudo-labeling strategy\nin terms of fairness criteria. Then, we empirically show for UTKFace, CelebA\nand COMPAS datasets that by combining CGL and the state-of-the-art\nfairness-aware in-processing methods, the target accuracies and the fairness\nmetrics are jointly improved compared to the baseline methods. Furthermore, we\nconvincingly show that our CGL enables to naturally augment the given\ngroup-labeled dataset with external datasets only with target labels so that\nboth accuracy and fairness metrics can be improved.

Data\npapers were then manually clustered based on their content, whereas their\nstrong citations were classified by hand according to the knowledge areas of\nthe Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge. A survey study on 108\nauthors and users of data papers provided further insights regarding motivation\nand effort in data paper production, encouraging and discouraging factors in\ndata set use, and future desired direction regarding data papers. Results: We\nfound that 65% of the data papers have been used in other studies, with a\nlong-tail distribution in the number of strong citations. Weak citations to\ndata papers usually refer to them as an example. MSR data papers are cited in\ntotal less than other MSR papers. A considerable number of the strong citations\nstem from the teams that authored the data papers. Publications providing\nVersion Control System (VCS) primary and derived data are the most frequent\ndata papers and the most often strongly cited ones. Enhanced developer data\npapers are the least common ones, and the second least frequently strongly\ncited. Data paper authors tend to gather data in the context of other research.\n[...]",

    "abstract": "Search engines are considered the primary tool to assist and empower learners\nin finding information relevant to their learning goals-be it learning\nsomething new, improving their existing skills, or just fulfilling a curiosity.\nWhile several approaches for improving search engines for the learning scenario\nhave been proposed, instructional scaffolding has not been studied in the\ncontext of search as learning, despite being shown to be effective for\nimproving learning in both digital and traditional learning contexts. When\nscaffolding is employed, instructors provide learners with support throughout\ntheir autonomous learning process. We hypothesize that the usage of scaffolding\ntechniques within a search system can be an effective way to help learners\nachieve their learning objectives whilst searching. As such, this paper\ninvestigates the incorporation of scaffolding into a search system employing\nthree different strategies (as well as a control condition): (I) AQE_{SC}, the\nautomatic expansion of user queries with relevant subtopics; (ii) CURATED_{SC},\nthe presenting of a manually curated static list of relevant subtopics on the\nsearch engine result page; and (iii) FEEDBACK_{SC}, which projects real-time\nfeedback about a user's exploration of the topic space on top of the\nCURATED_{SC} visualization. To investigate the effectiveness of these\napproaches with respect to human learning, we conduct a user study (N=126)\nwhere participants were tasked with searching and learning about topics such as\n`genetically modified organisms'. We find that (I) the introduction of the\nproposed scaffolding methods does not significantly improve learning gains.\nHowever, (ii) it does significantly impact search behavior. Furthermore, (iii)\nimmediate feedback of the participants' learning leads to undesirable user\nbehavior, with participants focusing on the feedback gauges instead of\nlearning.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive representation learning has proven to be an effective\nself-supervised learning method. Most successful approaches are based on the\nNoise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) paradigm and consider different views of an\ninstance as positives and other instances as noise that positives should be\ncontrasted with. However, all instances in a dataset are drawn from the same\ndistribution and share underlying semantic information that should not be\nconsidered as noise. We argue that a good data representation contains the\nrelations, or semantic similarity, between the instances. Contrastive learning\nimplicitly learns relations but considers the negatives as noise which is\nharmful to the quality of the learned relations and therefore the quality of\nthe representation. To circumvent this issue we propose a novel formulation of\ncontrastive learning using semantic similarity between instances called\nSimilarity Contrastive Estimation (SCE). Our training objective can be\nconsidered as soft contrastive learning. Instead of hard classifying positives\nand negatives, we propose a continuous distribution to push or pull instances\nbased on their semantic similarities. The target similarity distribution is\ncomputed from weak augmented instances and sharpened to eliminate irrelevant\nrelations. Each weak augmented instance is paired with a strong augmented\ninstance that contrasts its positive while maintaining the target similarity\ndistribution. Experimental results show that our proposed SCE outperforms its\nbaselines MoCov2 and ReSSL on various datasets and is competitive with\nstate-of-the-art algorithms on the ImageNet linear evaluation protocol.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental goal in neuroscience is to understand the relationship between\nneural activity and behavior. For example, the ability to extract behavioral\nintentions from neural data, or neural decoding, is critical for developing\neffective brain machine interfaces. Although simple linear models have been\napplied to this challenge, they cannot identify important non-linear\nrelationships. Thus, a self-supervised means of identifying non-linear\nrelationships between neural dynamics and behavior, in order to compute neural\nrepresentations, remains an important open problem. To address this challenge,\nwe generated a new multimodal dataset consisting of the spontaneous behaviors\ngenerated by fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster -- a popular model organism\nin neuroscience research. The dataset includes 3D markerless motion capture\ndata from six camera views of the animal generating spontaneous actions, as\nwell as synchronously acquired two-photon microscope images capturing the\nactivity of descending neuron populations that are thought to drive actions.\nStandard contrastive learning and unsupervised domain adaptation techniques\nstruggle to learn neural action representations (embeddings computed from the\nneural data describing action labels) due to large inter-animal differences in\nboth neural and behavioral modalities. To overcome this deficiency, we\ndeveloped simple yet effective augmentations that close the inter-animal domain\ngap, allowing us to extract behaviorally relevant, yet domain agnostic,\ninformation from neural data.

But these models are vulnerable to attacks. Many\nattackers exploit the model by polluting the data, which are trained to the\nmodel in various ways. So to act deftly in such situations model needs to\nreadily unlearn the polluted data without the need for retraining. Retraining\nis impractical in most cases as there is already a massive amount of data\ntrained to the model in the past, which needs to be trained again just for\nremoving a small amount of polluted data, which is often significantly less\nthan 1%. This problem can be solved by developing unlearning frameworks for all\nspam detection models. In this research, unlearning module is integrated into\nspam detection models that are based on Naive Bayes, Decision trees, and Random\nForests algorithms. To assess the benefits of unlearning over retraining, three\nspam detection models are polluted and exploited by taking attackers' positions\nand proving models' vulnerability. Reduction in accuracy and true positive\nrates are shown in each case showing the effect of pollution on models. Then\nunlearning modules are integrated into the models, and polluted data is\nunlearned; on testing the models after unlearning, restoration of performance\nis seen.

The\nrationale is that the signal fluctuations caused by humans carry the\ninformation of human behavior which can be extracted from the channel state\ninformation of WiFi. Still, the prior studies mainly focus on single-task\nsensing (STS), e.g., gesture recognition, indoor localization, user\nidentification. Since the fluctuations caused by gestures are highly coupling\nwith body features and the user's location, we propose a WiFi-based multi-task\nsensing model (Wimuse) to perform gesture recognition, indoor localization, and\nuser identification tasks simultaneously. However, these tasks have different\ndifficulty levels (i.e., imbalance issue) and need task-specific information\n(i.e., discrepancy issue). To address these issues, the knowledge distillation\ntechnique and task-specific residual adaptor are adopted in Wimuse. We first\ntrain the STS model for each task. Then, for solving the imbalance issue, the\nextracted common feature in Wimuse is encouraged to get close to the\ncounterpart features of the STS models. Further, for each task, a task-specific\nresidual adaptor is applied to extract the task-specific compensation feature\nwhich is fused with the common feature to address the discrepancy issue.

To address\nit, we propose Cyclic Graph Attentive Matching Encoder (C-GAME) based on a\nnovel Graph Matcher with double-layer attention mechanism. It realizes\neffective information exchange in underlying feature space and establishes\ncoupling relationship across spaces. The proposed model achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in experiments, and offers a novel framework for\ninference task across spaces in prospective employments.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) agents are widely used for solving complex\nsequential decision making tasks, but still exhibit difficulty in generalizing\nto scenarios not seen during training. While prior online approaches\ndemonstrated that using additional signals beyond the reward function can lead\nto better generalization capabilities in RL agents, i.e. using self-supervised\nlearning (SSL), they struggle in the offline RL setting, i.e. learning from a\nstatic dataset. We show that performance of online algorithms for\ngeneralization in RL can be hindered in the offline setting due to poor\nestimation of similarity between observations. We propose a new\ntheoretically-motivated framework called Generalized Similarity Functions\n(GSF), which uses contrastive learning to train an offline RL agent to\naggregate observations based on the similarity of their expected future\nbehavior, where we quantify this similarity using \\emph{generalized value\nfunctions}.

    "abstract": "Learning the manifold structure of remote sensing images is of paramount\nrelevance for modeling and understanding processes, as well as to encapsulate\nthe high dimensionality in a reduced set of informative features for subsequent\nclassification, regression, or unmixing. Manifold learning methods have shown\nexcellent performance to deal with hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis but,\nunless specifically designed, they cannot provide an explicit embedding map\nreadily applicable to out-of-sample data. A common assumption to deal with the\nproblem is that the transformation between the high-dimensional input space and\nthe (typically low) latent space is linear. This is a particularly strong\nassumption, especially when dealing with hyperspectral images due to the\nwell-known nonlinear nature of the data. To address this problem, a manifold\nlearning method based on High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR) is\nproposed, which enables to present a nonlinear embedding function to project\nout-of-sample samples into the latent space. The proposed method is compared to\nmanifold learning methods along with its linear counterparts and achieves\npromising performance in terms of classification accuracy of a representative\nset of hyperspectral images.",

Yet, a uniform specification on which\naspects constitute human-machine symbiosis is missing. By combining the\nexpertise of different disciplines, we elaborate on a multivariate perspective\nof symbiosis as the highest form of physically coupled human-machine systems.\nFour dimensions are considered: Task, interaction, performance, and experience.\nFirst, human and machine work together to accomplish a common task\nconceptualized on both a decision and an action level (task dimension). Second,\neach partner possesses an internal representation of own as well as the other\npartner's intentions and influence on the environment. This alignment, which is\nthe core of the interaction, constitutes the symbiotic understanding between\nboth partners, being the basis of a joint, highly coordinated and effective\naction (interaction dimension). Third, the symbiotic interaction leads to\nsynergetic effects regarding the intention recognition and complementary\nstrengths of the partners, resulting in a higher overall performance\n(performance dimension). Fourth, symbiotic systems specifically change the\nuser's experiences, like flow, acceptance, sense of agency, and embodiment\n(experience dimension).

    "abstract": "Inserting a backdoor into the joint model in federated learning (FL) is a\nrecent threat raising concerns. Existing studies mostly focus on developing\neffective countermeasures against this threat, assuming that backdoored local\nmodels, if any, somehow reveal themselves by anomalies in their gradients.\nHowever, this assumption needs to be elaborated by identifying specifically\nwhich gradients are more likely to indicate an anomaly to what extent under\nwhich conditions. This is an important issue given that neural network models\nusually have huge parametric space and consist of a large number of weights. In\nthis study, we make a deep gradient-level analysis on the expected variations\nin model gradients under several backdoor attack scenarios against FL. Our main\nnovel finding is that backdoor-induced anomalies in local model updates\n(weights or gradients) appear in the final layer bias weights of the malicious\nlocal models. We support and validate our findings by both theoretical and\nexperimental analysis in various FL settings. We also investigate the impact of\nthe number of malicious clients, learning rate, and malicious data rate on the\nobserved anomaly.

Detecting and monitoring sleepiness can help\nprevent these adverse events from happening. In this paper, we use the Voiceome\ndataset to extract speech from 1,828 participants to develop a deep transfer\nlearning model using Hidden-Unit BERT (HuBERT) speech representations to detect\nsleepiness from individuals. Speech is an under-utilized source of data in\nsleep detection, but as speech collection is easy, cost-effective, and\nnon-invasive, it provides a promising resource for sleepiness detection. Two\ncomplementary techniques were conducted in order to seek converging evidence\nregarding the importance of individual speech tasks. Our first technique,\nmasking, evaluated task importance by combining all speech tasks, masking\nselected responses in the speech, and observing systematic changes in model\naccuracy. Our second technique, separate training, compared the accuracy of\nmultiple models, each of which used the same architecture, but was trained on a\ndifferent subset of speech tasks. Our evaluation shows that the best-performing\nmodel utilizes the memory recall task and categorical naming task from the\nBoston Naming Test, which achieved an accuracy of 80.07% (F1-score of 0.85) and\n81.13% (F1-score of 0.89), respectively.",

    "abstract": "A typical pipeline for multi-object tracking (MOT) is to use a detector for\nobject localization, and following re-identification (re-ID) for object\nassociation. This pipeline is partially motivated by recent progress in both\nobject detection and re-ID, and partially motivated by biases in existing\ntracking datasets, where most objects tend to have distinguishing appearance\nand re-ID models are sufficient for establishing associations. In response to\nsuch bias, we would like to re-emphasize that methods for multi-object tracking\nshould also work when object appearance is not sufficiently discriminative. To\nthis end, we propose a large-scale dataset for multi-human tracking, where\nhumans have similar appearance, diverse motion and extreme articulation. As the\ndataset contains mostly group dancing videos, we name it \"DanceTrack\". We\nexpect DanceTrack to provide a better platform to develop more MOT algorithms\nthat rely less on visual discrimination and depend more on motion analysis. We\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art trackers on our dataset and observe a\nsignificant performance drop on DanceTrack when compared against existing\nbenchmarks.

It\nrequires the robot learning to be sample-efficient, generalizable,\ncompositional, and incremental. In this work, we introduce a systematic\nlearning framework called SAGCI-system towards achieving these above four\nrequirements. Our system first takes the raw point clouds gathered by the\ncamera mounted on the robot's wrist as the inputs and produces initial modeling\nof the surrounding environment represented as a URDF.

The robot\nthen utilizes the interactive perception to interact with the environments to\nonline verify and modify the URDF. Leveraging the simulation, we propose a new\nmodel-based RL algorithm combining object-centric and robot-centric approaches\nto efficiently produce policies to accomplish manipulation tasks. We apply our\nsystem to perform articulated object manipulation, both in the simulation and\nthe real world. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nproposed learning framework.

Although this technique has been widely used and\nsuccessful in recent decades, many existing models still suffer from multiple\ndrawbacks such as the massive number of unvalidated drug-disease associations\nand inner product in the matrix factorization model. The limitations of these\nworks are mainly due to the following two reasons: first, previous works used\nnegative sampling techniques to treat unvalidated drug-disease associations as\nnegative samples, which is invalid in real-world settings; Second, the inner\nproduct lacks modeling on the crossover information between dimensions of the\nlatent factor. In this paper, we propose a novel PUON framework for addressing\nthe above deficiencies, which models the joint distribution of drug-disease\nassociations using validated and unvalidated drug-disease associations without\nemploying negative sampling techniques. The PUON also modeled the\ncross-information of the latent factor of drugs and diseases using the outer\nproduct operation. For a comprehensive comparison, we considered 7 popular\nbaselines. Extensive experiments in two real-world datasets showed that PUON\nachieved the best performance based on 6 popular evaluation metrics.",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation (DA) is a common solution to data scarcity and imbalance\nproblems, which is an area getting increasing attentions from the Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) community. While various DA techniques have been used\nin NLP research, little is known about the role of linguistic knowledge in DA\nfor NLP; in particular, whether more linguistic knowledge leads to a better DA\napproach. To investigate that, we designed two adapted DA programs and applied\nthem to LCQMC (a Large-scale Chinese Question Matching Corpus) for a binary\nChinese question matching classification task. The two DA programs produce\naugmented texts by five simple text editing operations, largely irrespective of\nlanguage generation rules, but one is enhanced with a n-gram language model to\nmake it fused with extra linguistic knowledge. We then trained four neural\nnetwork models and a pre-trained model on the LCQMC train sets of varying size\nas well as the corresponding augmented trained sets produced by the two DA\nprograms. The test set performances of the five classification models show that\nadding probabilistic linguistic knowledge as constrains does not make the base\nDA program better, since there are no discernible performance differences\nbetween the models trained on the two types of augmented train sets. Instead,\nsince the added linguistic knowledge decreases the diversity of the augmented\ntexts, the trained models generalizability is hampered. Moreover, models\ntrained on both types of the augmented trained sets were found to be\noutperformed by those directly trained on the associated un-augmented train\nsets, due to the inability of the underlying text editing operations to make\nparaphrastic augmented texts. We concluded that the validity and diversity of\nthe augmented texts are two important factors for a DA approach or technique to\nbe effective and proposed a possible paradigm shift for text augmentation.",

    "title": "Exploring Alignment of Representations with Human Perception",
    "abstract": "We argue that a valuable perspective on when a model learns \\textit{good}\nrepresentations is that inputs that are mapped to similar representations by\nthe model should be perceived similarly by humans. We use\n\\textit{representation inversion} to generate multiple inputs that map to the\nsame model representation, then quantify the perceptual similarity of these\ninputs via human surveys. Our approach yields a measure of the extent to which\na model is aligned with human perception. Using this measure of alignment, we\nevaluate models trained with various learning paradigms (\\eg~supervised and\nself-supervised learning) and different training losses (standard and robust\ntraining). Our results suggest that the alignment of representations with human\nperception provides useful additional insights into the qualities of a model.\nFor example, we find that alignment with human perception can be used as a\nmeasure of trust in a model's prediction on inputs where different models have\nconflicting outputs. We also find that various properties of a model like its\narchitecture, training paradigm, training loss, and data augmentation play a\nsignificant role in learning representations that are aligned with human\nperception.",

    "abstract": "Despite machine learning models' success in Natural Language Processing (NLP)\ntasks, predictions from these models frequently fail on out-of-distribution\n(OOD) samples. Prior works have focused on developing state-of-the-art methods\nfor detecting OOD. The fundamental question of how OOD samples differ from\nin-distribution samples remains unanswered. This paper explores how data\ndynamics in training models can be used to understand the fundamental\ndifferences between OOD and in-distribution samples in extensive detail. We\nfound that syntactic characteristics of the data samples that the model\nconsistently predicts incorrectly in both OOD and in-distribution cases\ndirectly contradict each other. In addition, we observed preliminary evidence\nsupporting the hypothesis that models are more likely to latch on trivial\nsyntactic heuristics (e.g., overlap of words between two sentences) when making\npredictions on OOD samples.

    "abstract": "In this paper we solve the problem of no-regret learning in general games.\nSpecifically, we provide a simple and practical algorithm that achieves\nconstant regret with fixed step-sizes. The cumulative regret of our algorithm\nprovably decreases linearly as the step-size increases. Our findings depart\nfrom the prevailing paradigm that vanishing step-sizes are a prerequisite for\nlow regret as championed by all state-of-the-art methods to date.\nWe shift away from this paradigm by defining a novel algorithm that we call\nClairvoyant Multiplicative Weights Updates (CMWU). CMWU is Multiplicative\nWeights Updates (MWU) equipped with a mental model (jointly shared across all\nagents) about the state of the system in its next period. Each agent records\nits mixed strategy, i.e., its belief about what it expects to play in the next\nperiod, in this shared mental model which is internally updated using MWU\nwithout any changes to the real-world behavior up until it equilibrates, thus\nmarking its consistency with the next day's real-world outcome. It is then and\nonly then that agents take action in the real-world, effectively doing so with\nthe ``full knowledge\" of the state of the system on the next day, i.e., they\nare clairvoyant. CMWU effectively acts as MWU with one day look-ahead,\nachieving bounded regret. At a technical level, we establish that\nself-consistent mental models exist for any choice of step-sizes and provide\nbounds on the step-size under which their uniqueness and linear-time\ncomputation are guaranteed via contraction mapping arguments.

    "abstract": "One of the key criticisms of deep learning is that large amounts of expensive\nand difficult-to-acquire training data are required in order to train models\nwith high performance and good generalization capabilities. Focusing on the\ntask of monocular camera pose estimation via scene coordinate regression (SCR),\nwe describe a novel method, Domain Adaptation of Networks for Camera pose\nEstimation (DANCE), which enables the training of models without access to any\nlabels on the target task. DANCE requires unlabeled images (without known\nposes, ordering, or scene coordinate labels) and a 3D representation of the\nspace (e.g., a scanned point cloud), both of which can be captured with minimal\neffort using off-the-shelf commodity hardware. DANCE renders labeled synthetic\nimages from the 3D model, and bridges the inevitable domain gap between\nsynthetic and real images by applying unsupervised image-level domain\nadaptation techniques (unpaired image-to-image translation). When tested on\nreal images, the SCR model trained with DANCE achieved comparable performance\nto its fully supervised counterpart (in both cases using PnP-RANSAC for final\npose estimation) at a fraction of the cost.

    "abstract": "The visual world naturally exhibits a long-tailed distribution of open\nclasses, which poses great challenges to modern visual systems. Existing\napproaches either perform class re-balancing strategies or directly improve\nnetwork modules to address the problem. However, they still train models with a\nfinite set of predefined labels, limiting their supervision information and\nrestricting their transferability to novel instances. Recent advances in\nlarge-scale contrastive visual-language pretraining shed light on a new pathway\nfor visual recognition. With open-vocabulary supervisions, pretrained\ncontrastive vision-language models learn powerful multimodal representations\nthat are promising to handle data deficiency and unseen concepts. By\ncalculating the semantic similarity between visual and text inputs, visual\nrecognition is converted to a vision-language matching problem. Inspired by\nthis, we propose BALLAD to leverage contrastive vision-language models for\nlong-tailed recognition. We first continue pretraining the vision-language\nbackbone through contrastive learning on a specific long-tailed target dataset.\nAfterward, we freeze the backbone and further employ an additional adapter\nlayer to enhance the representations of tail classes on balanced training\nsamples built with re-sampling strategies. Extensive experiments have been\nconducted on three popular long-tailed recognition benchmarks. As a result, our\nsimple and effective approach sets the new state-of-the-art performances and\noutperforms competitive baselines with a large margin.

In this regard, High-Level Synthesis (HLS)\nemerges as a solution for fast prototyping application-specific hardware\nstarting from a behavioural description of the application computational flow.\nThis Design-Space Exploration (DSE) aims at identifying Pareto optimal\nsynthesis configurations whose exhaustive search is often unfeasible due to the\ndesign-space dimensionality and the prohibitive computational cost of the\nsynthesis process. Within this framework, we effectively and efficiently\naddress the design problem by proposing, for the first time in the literature,\ngraph neural networks that jointly predict acceleration performance and\nhardware costs of a synthesized behavioral specification given optimization\ndirectives. The learned model can be used to rapidly approach the Pareto curve\nby guiding the DSE, taking into account performance and cost estimates. The\nproposed method outperforms traditional HLS-driven DSE approaches, by\naccounting for arbitrary length of computer programs and the invariant\nproperties of the input. We propose a novel hybrid control and data flow graph\nrepresentation that enables training the graph neural network on specifications\nof different hardware accelerators; the methodology naturally transfers to\nunseen data-processing applications too. Moreover, we show that our approach\nachieves prediction accuracy comparable with that of commonly used simulators\nwithout having access to analytical models of the HLS compiler and the target\nFPGA, while being orders of magnitude faster.

    "title": "Contextual Combinatorial Volatile Bandits with Satisfying via Gaussian  Processes",
    "abstract": "In many real-world applications of combinatorial bandits such as content\ncaching, rewards must be maximized while satisfying minimum service\nrequirements. In addition, base arm availabilities vary over time, and actions\nneed to be adapted to the situation to maximize the rewards. We propose a new\nbandit model called Contextual Combinatorial Volatile Bandits with Group\nThresholds to address these challenges. Our model subsumes combinatorial\nbandits by considering super arms to be subsets of groups of base arms. We seek\nto maximize super arm rewards while satisfying thresholds of all base arm\ngroups that constitute a super arm. To this end, we define a new notion of\nregret that merges super arm reward maximization with group reward\nsatisfaction. To facilitate learning, we assume that the mean outcomes of base\narms are samples from a Gaussian Process indexed by the context set ${\\cal X}$,\nand the expected reward is Lipschitz continuous in expected base arm outcomes.\nWe propose an algorithm, called Thresholded Combinatorial Gaussian Process\nUpper Confidence Bounds (TCGP-UCB), that balances between maximizing cumulative\nreward and satisfying group reward thresholds and prove that it incurs\n$\\tilde{O}(K\\sqrt{T\\overline{\\gamma}_{T}} )$ regret with high probability,\nwhere $\\overline{\\gamma}_{T}$ is the maximum information gain associated with\nthe set of base arm contexts that appeared in the first $T$ rounds and $K$ is\nthe maximum super arm cardinality of any feasible action over all rounds. We\nshow in experiments that our algorithm accumulates a reward comparable with\nthat of the state-of-the-art combinatorial bandit algorithm while picking\nactions whose groups satisfy their thresholds.",

Yet, the current paradigm suffers from two\nshortcomings: brittle under covariate shift and inefficient for knowledge\ntransfer. In this work, we propose to address these challenges from a causal\nrepresentation perspective. We first introduce a causal formalism of motion\nforecasting, which casts the problem as a dynamic process with three groups of\nlatent variables, namely invariant mechanisms, style confounders, and spurious\nfeatures. We then introduce a learning framework that treats each group\nseparately: (i) unlike the common practice of merging datasets collected from\ndifferent locations, we exploit their subtle distinctions by means of an\ninvariance loss encouraging the model to suppress spurious correlations; (ii)\nwe devise a modular architecture that factorizes the representations of\ninvariant mechanisms and style confounders to approximate a causal graph; (iii)\nwe introduce a style consistency loss that not only enforces the structure of\nstyle representations but also serves as a self-supervisory signal for\ntest-time refinement on the fly. Experiment results on synthetic and real\ndatasets show that our three proposed components significantly improve the\nrobustness and reusability of the learned motion representations, outperforming\nprior state-of-the-art motion forecasting models for out-of-distribution\ngeneralization and low-shot transfer.",

    "abstract": "The referring video object segmentation task (RVOS) involves segmentation of\na text-referred object instance in the frames of a given video. Due to the\ncomplex nature of this multimodal task, which combines text reasoning, video\nunderstanding, instance segmentation and tracking, existing approaches\ntypically rely on sophisticated pipelines in order to tackle it. In this paper,\nwe propose a simple Transformer-based approach to RVOS. Our framework, termed\nMultimodal Tracking Transformer (MTTR), models the RVOS task as a sequence\nprediction problem. Following recent advancements in computer vision and\nnatural language processing, MTTR is based on the realization that video and\ntext can both be processed together effectively and elegantly by a single\nmultimodal Transformer model. MTTR is end-to-end trainable, free of\ntext-related inductive bias components and requires no additional\nmask-refinement post-processing steps. As such, it simplifies the RVOS pipeline\nconsiderably compared to existing methods. Evaluation on standard benchmarks\nreveals that MTTR significantly outperforms previous art across multiple\nmetrics. In particular, MTTR shows impressive +5.7 and +5.0 mAP gains on the\nA2D-Sentences and JHMDB-Sentences datasets respectively, while processing 76\nframes per second. In addition, we report strong results on the public\nvalidation set of Refer-YouTube-VOS, a more challenging RVOS dataset that has\nyet to receive the attention of researchers.

    "abstract": "We present the vector quantized diffusion (VQ-Diffusion) model for\ntext-to-image generation. This method is based on a vector quantized\nvariational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) whose latent space is modeled by a conditional\nvariant of the recently developed Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model\n(DDPM). We find that this latent-space method is well-suited for text-to-image\ngeneration tasks because it not only eliminates the unidirectional bias with\nexisting methods but also allows us to incorporate a mask-and-replace diffusion\nstrategy to avoid the accumulation of errors, which is a serious problem with\nexisting methods. Our experiments show that the VQ-Diffusion produces\nsignificantly better text-to-image generation results when compared with\nconventional autoregressive (AR) models with similar numbers of parameters.\nCompared with previous GAN-based text-to-image methods, our VQ-Diffusion can\nhandle more complex scenes and improve the synthesized image quality by a large\nmargin. Finally, we show that the image generation computation in our method\ncan be made highly efficient by reparameterization. With traditional AR\nmethods, the text-to-image generation time increases linearly with the output\nimage resolution and hence is quite time consuming even for normal size images.\nThe VQ-Diffusion allows us to achieve a better trade-off between quality and\nspeed. Our experiments indicate that the VQ-Diffusion model with the\nreparameterization is fifteen times faster than traditional AR methods while\nachieving a better image quality.",

    "abstract": "Fitting parametric models of human bodies, hands or faces to sparse input\nsignals in an accurate, robust, and fast manner has the promise of\nsignificantly improving immersion in AR and VR scenarios. A common first step\nin systems that tackle these problems is to regress the parameters of the\nparametric model directly from the input data. This approach is fast, robust,\nand is a good starting point for an iterative minimization algorithm. The\nlatter searches for the minimum of an energy function, typically composed of a\ndata term and priors that encode our knowledge about the problem's structure.\nWhile this is undoubtedly a very successful recipe, priors are often hand\ndefined heuristics and finding the right balance between the different terms to\nachieve high quality results is a non-trivial task. Furthermore, converting and\noptimizing these systems to run in a performant way requires custom\nimplementations that demand significant time investments from both engineers\nand domain experts. In this work, we build upon recent advances in learned\noptimization and propose an update rule inspired by the classic\nLevenberg-Marquardt algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed neural\noptimizer on the problems of 3D body surface estimation from a head-mounted\ndevice and face fitting from 2D landmarks.

    "abstract": "The nonuniform quantization strategy for compressing neural networks usually\nachieves better performance than its counterpart, i.e., uniform strategy, due\nto its superior representational capacity. However, many nonuniform\nquantization methods overlook the complicated projection process in\nimplementing the nonuniformly quantized weights/activations, which incurs\nnon-negligible time and space overhead in hardware deployment. In this study,\nwe propose Nonuniform-to-Uniform Quantization (N2UQ), a method that can\nmaintain the strong representation ability of nonuniform methods while being\nhardware-friendly and efficient as the uniform quantization for model\ninference. We achieve this through learning the flexible in-equidistant input\nthresholds to better fit the underlying distribution while quantizing these\nreal-valued inputs into equidistant output levels. To train the quantized\nnetwork with learnable input thresholds, we introduce a generalized\nstraight-through estimator (G-STE) for intractable backward derivative\ncalculation w.r.t. threshold parameters. Additionally, we consider entropy\npreserving regularization to further reduce information loss in weight\nquantization. Even under this adverse constraint of imposing uniformly\nquantized weights and activations, our N2UQ outperforms state-of-the-art\nnonuniform quantization methods by 0.7~1.8% on ImageNet, demonstrating the\ncontribution of N2UQ design.

    "abstract": "While gravitational microlensing by planetary systems can provide unique\nvistas on the properties of exoplanets, observations of such 2-body\nmicrolensing events can often be explained with multiple and distinct physical\nconfigurations, so-called model degeneracies. An understanding of the intrinsic\nand exogenous origins of different classes of degeneracy provides a foundation\nfor phenomenological interpretation. Here, leveraging a fast machine-learning\nbased inference framework, we present the discovery of a new regime of\ndegeneracy--the offset degeneracy--which unifies the previously known\nclose-wide and inner-outer degeneracies, generalises to resonant caustics, and\nupon reanalysis, is ubiquitous in previously published planetary events with\n2-fold degenerate solutions. Importantly, our discovery suggests that the\ncommonly reported close-wide degeneracy essentially never arises in actual\nevents and should, instead, be more suitably viewed as a transition point of\nthe offset degeneracy. While previous studies of microlensing degeneracies are\nlargely studies of degenerate caustics, our discovery demonstrates that\ndegenerate caustics do not necessarily result in degenerate events, which for\nthe latter it is more relevant to study magnifications at the location of the\nsource. This discovery fundamentally changes the way in which degeneracies in\nplanetary microlensing events should be interpreted, suggests a deeper symmetry\nin the mathematics of 2-body lenses than has previously been recognised, and\nwill increasingly manifest itself in data from new generations of microlensing\nsurveys.",

It is shown that, while both well-resolved and under-resolved\nsimulations of linear problems correlate well with the eigenanalysis prediction\nof time integration errors, the correlation can be much worse for\nunder-resolved nonlinear problems. The effect of mesh regularity is also\nconsidered, where time integration errors are found to be, in the case of\nirregular grids, less pronounced than those of the spatial discretisation. In\nfact, for the under-resolved vortical flows considered, the predominance of\nspatial errors made it practically impossible for time integration errors to be\ndistinctly identified.

A $\\lambda$-labeling of a graph $G$ is any labeling of the vertices of\n$G$ with different labels such that any two adjacent vertices receive labels\nwhich differ at least two. Also an $L(2,1)$-coloring of $G$ is any labeling of\nthe vertices of $G$ such that any two adjacent vertices receive labels which\ndiffer at least two and any two vertices with distance two receive distinct\nlabels.

    "abstract": "To solve the ill-posed problem of hyperspectral image super-resolution\n(HSISR), an usually method is to use the prior information of the hyperspectral\nimages (HSIs) as a regularization term to constrain the objective function.\nModel-based methods using hand-crafted priors cannot fully characterize the\nproperties of HSIs. Learning-based methods usually use a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) to learn the implicit priors of HSIs. However, the learning\nability of CNN is limited, it only considers the spatial characteristics of the\nHSIs and ignores the spectral characteristics, and convolution is not effective\nfor long-range dependency modeling. There is still a lot of room for\nimprovement. In this paper, we propose a novel HSISR method that uses\nTransformer instead of CNN to learn the prior of HSIs. Specifically, we first\nuse the proximal gradient algorithm to solve the HSISR model, and then use an\nunfolding network to simulate the iterative solution processes. The\nself-attention layer of Transformer makes it have the ability of spatial global\ninteraction. In addition, we add 3D-CNN behind the Transformer layers to better\nexplore the spatio-spectral correlation of HSIs. Both quantitative and visual\nresults on two widely used HSI datasets and the real-world dataset demonstrate\nthat the proposed method achieves a considerable gain compared to all the\nmainstream algorithms including the most competitive conventional methods and\nthe recently proposed deep learning-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Magnesium hydride (MgH$_2$) has been widely studied for effective hydrogen\nstorage. However, its bulk desorption temperature (553 K) is deemed too high\nfor practical applications. Besides doping, a strategy to decrease such\nreaction energy for releasing hydrogen is the use of MgH$_2$-based\nnanoparticles (NPs). Here, we investigate first the thermodynamic properties of\nMg$_n$H$_{2n}$ NPs ($n<10$) from first-principles, in particular by assessing\nthe anharmonic effects on the enthalpy, entropy and thermal expansion by means\nof the Stochastic Self Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SSCHA). The latter\nmethod goes beyond previous approaches, typically based on molecular mechanics\nand the quasi-harmonic approximation, allowing the ab initio calculation of the\nfully-anharmonic free energy. We find an almost linear dependence on\ntemperature of the interatomic bond lengths - with a relative variation of few\npercent over 300K -, alongside with a bond distance decrease of the Mg-H bonds.\nIn order to increase the size of NPs toward experiments of hydrogen desorption\nfrom MgH$_2$ we devise a computationally effective Machine Learning model\ntrained to accurately determine the forces and total energies (i.e. the\npotential energy surfaces), integrating the latter with the SSCHA model to\nfully include the anharmonic effects. We find a significative decrease of the\nH-desorption temperature for sub-nanometric clusters Mg$_n$H$_{2n}$ with $n\n\\leq 10$, with a non-negligible, although little effect due to anharmonicities\n(up to 10%).",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has recently made remarkable progress in natural language\nprocessing. Yet, the resulting algorithms remain far from competing with the\nlanguage abilities of the human brain. Predictive coding theory offers a\npotential explanation to this discrepancy: while deep language algorithms are\noptimized to predict adjacent words, the human brain would be tuned to make\nlong-range and hierarchical predictions. To test this hypothesis, we analyze\nthe fMRI brain signals of 304 subjects each listening to 70min of short\nstories. After confirming that the activations of deep language algorithms\nlinearly map onto those of the brain, we show that enhancing these models with\nlong-range forecast representations improves their brain-mapping. The results\nfurther reveal a hierarchy of predictions in the brain, whereby the\nfronto-parietal cortices forecast more abstract and more distant\nrepresentations than the temporal cortices. Overall, this study strengthens\npredictive coding theory and suggests a critical role of long-range and\nhierarchical predictions in natural language processing.",

    "abstract": "Shortening acquisition time and reducing the motion-artifact are two of the\nmost essential concerns in magnetic resonance imaging. As a promising solution,\ndeep learning-based high quality MR image restoration has been investigated to\ngenerate higher resolution and motion artifact-free MR images from lower\nresolution images acquired with shortened acquisition time, without costing\nadditional acquisition time or modifying the pulse sequences. However, numerous\nproblems still exist to prevent deep learning approaches from becoming\npractical in the clinic environment. Specifically, most of the prior works\nfocus solely on the network model but ignore the impact of various downsampling\nstrategies on the acquisition time. Besides, the long inference time and high\nGPU consumption are also the bottle neck to deploy most of the prior works in\nclinics. Furthermore, prior studies employ random movement in retrospective\nmotion artifact generation, resulting in uncontrollable severity of motion\nartifact. More importantly, doctors are unsure whether the generated MR images\nare trustworthy, making diagnosis difficult. To overcome all these problems, we\nemployed a unified 2D deep learning neural network for both 3D MRI super\nresolution and motion artifact reduction, demonstrating such a framework can\nachieve better performance in 3D MRI restoration task compared to other states\nof the art methods and remains the GPU consumption and inference time\nsignificantly low, thus easier to deploy. We also analyzed several downsampling\nstrategies based on the acceleration factor, including multiple combinations of\nin-plane and through-plane downsampling, and developed a controllable and\nquantifiable motion artifact generation method. At last, the pixel-wise\nuncertainty was calculated and used to estimate the accuracy of generated\nimage, providing additional information for reliable diagnosis.",

Another key issue is the widely popular\nassumption among experimenters that participants do not influence each other --\nwhich is far from reality in a field study and can, if unaccounted for,\ndeteriorate the quality of the trial.\nWe address both issues in our work. After introducing randomized controlled\ntrials bridging terms from different disciplines, we first address the issue of\nparticipant-treatment assignment in the presence of known covariate factors.\nThereby, we review a recent assignment algorithm that achieves good worst-case\nvariance bounds.\nSecond, we address social spillover effects.

    "abstract": "In this paper we study the recursive sequence $x_{n+1}=\\frac{x_n+f(x_n)}{2}$\nfor each continuous real-valued function $f$ on an interval $[a,b]$, where\n$x_0$ is an arbitrary point in $[a,b]$. First, we present some results for\nreal-valued continuous function $f$ on $[a,b]$ which have a unique fixed point\n$c\\in (a,b)$ and show that the sequence $\\{x_n\\}$ converges to $c$ provided\nthat $f$ satisfies some conditions. By assuming that $c$ is a root of $f$\ninstead of being its fixed point, we extend these results. We define two other\nsequences by $x^{+}_0=x^{-}_0=x_0\\in [a,b]$ and\n$x^{+}_{n+1}=x^{+}_n+\\frac{f(x^{+}_n)}{2}$ and $x^{-}_{n+1}=\nx^{-}_n-\\frac{f(x^{-}_n)}{2}$ for each $n\\ge 0$. We show that for each\nreal-valued continuous function $f$ on $[a,b]$ with $f(a)>0>f(b)$ which has a\nunique root $c\\in (a,b)$, the sequence $\\{x^{+}_n\\}$ converges to $c$ provided\nthat $f^{'}\\ge -2$ on $(a,b)$. Accordingly we show that for each real-valued\ncontinuous function $f$ on $[a,b]$ with $f(a)<0<f(b)$ which has a unique root\n$c\\in (a,b)$, the sequence $\\{x^{-}_n\\}$ converges to $c$ provided that\n$f^{'}\\le 2$ on $(a,b)$.

    "title": "Deep Video Coding with Dual-Path Generative Adversarial Network",
    "abstract": "The deep-learning-based video coding has attracted substantial attention for\nits great potential to squeeze out the spatial-temporal redundancies of video\nsequences. This paper proposes an efficient codec namely dual-path generative\nadversarial network-based video codec (DGVC). First, we propose a dual-path\nenhancement with generative adversarial network (DPEG) to reconstruct the\ncompressed video details. The DPEG consists of an $\\alpha$-path of auto-encoder\nand convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM), which facilitates the\nstructure feature reconstruction with a large receptive field and multi-frame\nreferences, and a $\\beta$-path of residual attention blocks, which facilitates\nthe reconstruction of local texture features. Both paths are fused and\nco-trained by a generative-adversarial process. Second, we reuse the DPEG\nnetwork in both motion compensation and quality enhancement modules, which are\nfurther combined with motion estimation and entropy coding modules in our DGVC\nframework. Third, we employ a joint training of deep video compression and\nenhancement to further improve the rate-distortion (RD) performance. Compared\nwith x265 LDP very fast mode, our DGVC reduces the average bit-per-pixel (bpp)\nby 39.39%/54.92% at the same PSNR/MS-SSIM, which outperforms the state-of-the\nart deep video codecs by a considerable margin.",

Recent works pointed to the\ndistortion of information flowing from distant nodes as a factor limiting the\nefficiency of message passing for tasks relying on long-distance interactions.\nThis phenomenon, referred to as 'over-squashing', has been heuristically\nattributed to graph bottlenecks where the number of $k$-hop neighbors grows\nrapidly with $k$. We provide a precise description of the over-squashing\nphenomenon in GNNs and analyze how it arises from bottlenecks in the graph. For\nthis purpose, we introduce a new edge-based combinatorial curvature and prove\nthat negatively curved edges are responsible for the over-squashing issue. We\nalso propose and experimentally test a curvature-based graph rewiring method to\nalleviate the over-squashing.",

The pandemic and the associated NPIs have triggered unprecedented\nwaves of economic shocks to the financial markets, including the foreign\nexchange (FX) markets. Although there are some studies exploring the impact of\nthe NPIs and ESPs on FX markets, the relative impact of individual NPIs or ESPs\nhas not been studied in a combined framework. In this work, we investigate the\nrelative impact of NPIs and ESPs with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques.\nExperiments over exchange rate data of G10 currencies during the period from\nJanuary 1, 2020 to January 13, 2021 suggest strong impacts on exchange rate\nmarkets by all measures of the strict lockdown, such as stay at home\nrequirements, workplace closing, international travel control, and restrictions\non internal movement. Yet, the impact of individual NPI and ESP can vary across\ndifferent currencies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that\nuses XAI techniques to study the relative impact of NPIs and ESPs on the FX\nmarket.

The\nsensitivity of these high-frequency LOS links to blockages, however, challenges\nthe reliability and latency requirements of these communication networks. In\nthis paper, we propose to utilize radar sensors to provide sensing information\nabout the surrounding environment and moving objects, and leverage this\ninformation to proactively predict future link blockages before they happen.\nThis is motivated by the low cost of the radar sensors, their ability to\nefficiently capture important features such as the range, angle, velocity of\nthe moving scatterers (candidate blockages), and their capability to capture\nradar frames at relatively high speed. We formulate the radar-aided proactive\nblockage prediction problem and develop two solutions for this problem based on\nclassical radar object tracking and deep neural networks. The two solutions are\ndesigned to leverage domain knowledge and the understanding of the blockage\nprediction problem. To accurately evaluate the proposed solutions, we build a\nlarge-scale real-world dataset, based on the DeepSense framework, gathering\nco-existing radar and mmWave communication measurements of more than $10$\nthousand data points and various blockage objects (vehicles, bikes, humans,\netc.).
