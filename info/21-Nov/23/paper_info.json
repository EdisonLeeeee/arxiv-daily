    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the development of a multilingual dataset annotated\nwith a hierarchical, fine-grained tagset marking different types of aggression\nand the \"context\" in which they occur. The context, here, is defined by the\nconversational thread in which a specific comment occurs and also the \"type\" of\ndiscursive role that the comment is performing with respect to the previous\ncomment. The initial dataset, being discussed here (and made available as part\nof the ComMA@ICON shared task), consists of a total 15,000 annotated comments\nin four languages - Meitei, Bangla, Hindi, and Indian English - collected from\nvarious social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Telegram.\nAs is usual on social media websites, a large number of these comments are\nmultilingual, mostly code-mixed with English. The paper gives a detailed\ndescription of the tagset being used for annotation and also the process of\ndeveloping a multi-label, fine-grained tagset that can be used for marking\ncomments with aggression and bias of various kinds including gender bias,\nreligious intolerance (called communal bias in the tagset), class/caste bias\nand ethnic/racial bias. We also define and discuss the tags that have been used\nfor marking different the discursive role being performed through the comments,\nsuch as attack, defend, etc. We also present a statistical analysis of the\ndataset as well as results of our baseline experiments with developing an\nautomatic aggression identification system using the dataset developed.",

These relationships are\nequally important when dealing with nested data formats such as JSON. However,\nthe definition of functional and inclusion dependencies makes use of a flat,\nunnested relational model which misses many useful types of dependencies on\ndata which involve nested data models.\nIn this work, we identify types of dependencies which are not captured by\ntraditional functional and inclusion dependencies but which nevertheless\ncapture meaningful relationships among nested data. We also demonstrate how\nalgorithms for mining these traditional dependencies can be adapted to also\nmine nested dependencies. The first strategy simply flattens the input data and\nfeeds into unmodified existing algorithms. We present a second strategy which\ninstead adapts the algorithm to efficiently process JSON data as input which in\nsome cases leads to a reduction in runtime by multiple orders of magnitude on\nreal-world datasets.

    "abstract": "Mixed-typed languages enable programmers to link typed and untyped components\nin various ways. Some offer rich type systems to facilitate the smooth\nmigration of untyped code to the typed world; others merely provide a\nconvenient form of type Dynamic together with a conventional structural type\nsystem. Orthogonal to this dimension, Natural systems ensure the integrity of\ntypes with a sophisticated contract system, while Transient systems insert\nsimple first-order checks at strategic places within typed code. Furthermore,\neach method of ensuring type integrity comes with its own blame-assignment\nstrategy.\nTyped Racket has a rich migratory type system and enforces the types with a\nNatural semantics. Reticulated Python has a simple structural type system\nextended with Dynamic and enforces types with a Transient semantics. While\nTyped Racket satisfies the most stringent gradual-type soundness properties at\na significant performance cost, Reticulated Python seems to limit the\nperformance penalty to a tolerable degree and is nevertheless type sound. This\ncomparison raises the question of whether Transient checking is applicable to\nand beneficial for a rich migratory type system.\nThis paper reports on the surprising difficulties of adapting the Transient\nsemantics of Reticulated Python to the rich migratory type system of Typed\nRacket. The resulting implementation, Shallow Typed Racket, is faster than the\nstandard Deep Typed Racket but only when the Transient blame assignment\nstrategy is disabled.

    "title": "Types for Tables: A Language Design Benchmark",
    "abstract": "Context: Tables are ubiquitous formats for data. Therefore, techniques for\nwriting correct programs over tables, and debugging incorrect ones, are vital.\nOur specific focus in this paper is on rich types that articulate the\nproperties of tabular operations. We wish to study both their expressive power\nand _diagnostic quality_.\nInquiry: There is no \"standard library\" of table operations. As a result,\nevery paper (and project) is free to use its own (sub)set of operations. This\nmakes artifacts very difficult to compare, and it can be hard to tell whether\nomitted operations were left out by oversight or because they cannot actually\nbe expressed. Furthermore, virtually no papers discuss the quality of type\nerror feedback.\nApproach: We combed through several existing languages and libraries to\ncreate a \"standard library\" of table operations. Each entry is accompanied by a\ndetailed specification of its \"type,\" expressed independent of (and hence not\nconstrained by) any type language. We also studied and categorized a corpus of\n(student) program edits that resulted in table-related errors. We used this to\ngenerate a suite of erroneous programs. Finally, we adapted the concept of a\ndatasheet to facilitate comparisons of different implementations.\nKnowledge: Our benchmark creates a common ground to frame work in this area.\nLanguage designers who claim to support typed programming over tables have a\nclear suite against which to demonstrate their system's expressive power. Our\nfamily of errors also gives them a chance to demonstrate the quality of\nfeedback. Researchers who improve one aspect -- especially error reporting --\nwithout changing the other can demonstrate their improvement, as can those who\nengage in trade-offs between the two. The net result should be much better\nscience in both expressiveness and diagnostics. We also introduce a datasheet\nformat for presenting this knowledge in a methodical way.\nGrounding: We have generated our benchmark from real languages, libraries,\nand programs, as well as personal experience conducting and teaching data\nscience. We have drawn on experience in engineering and, more recently, in data\nscience to generate the datasheet.\nImportance: Claims about type support for tabular programming are hard to\nevaluate. However, tabular programming is ubiquitous, and the expressive power\nof type systems keeps growing. Our benchmark and datasheet can help lead to\nmore orderly science. It also benefits programmers trying to choose a language.",

    "title": "Automated, Targeted Testing of Property-Based Testing Predicates",
    "abstract": "Context: This work is based on property-based testing (PBT). PBT is an\nincreasingly important form of software testing. Furthermore, it serves as a\nconcrete gateway into the abstract area of formal methods. Specifically, we\nfocus on students learning PBT methods.\nInquiry: How well do students do at PBT? Our goal is to assess the quality of\nthe predicates they write as part of PBT. Prior work introduced the idea of\ndecomposing the predicate's property into a conjunction of independent\nsubproperties. Testing the predicate against each subproperty gives a\n\"semantic\" understanding of their performance.\nApproach: The notion of independence of subproperties both seems intuitive\nand was an important condition in prior work. First, we show that this\ncondition is overly restrictive and might hide valuable information: it both\nundercounts errors and makes it hard to capture misconceptions. Second, we\nintroduce two forms of automation, one based on PBT tools and the other on\nSAT-solving, to enable testing of student predicates. Third, we compare the\noutput of these automated tools against manually-constructed tests. Fourth, we\nalso measure the performance of those tools. Finally, we re-assess student\nperformance reported in prior work.\nKnowledge: We show the difficulty caused by the independent subproperty\nrequirement. We provide insight into how to use automation effectively to\nassess PBT predicates. In particular, we discuss the steps we had to take to\nbeat human performance. We also provide insight into how to make the automation\nwork efficiently. Finally, we present a much richer account than prior work of\nhow students did.\nGrounding: Our methods are grounded in mathematical logic. We also make use\nof well-understood principles of test generation from more formal\nspecifications. This combination ensures the soundness of our work. We use\nstandard methods to measure performance.\nImportance: As both educators and programmers, we believe PBT is a valuable\ntool for students to learn, and its importance will only grow as more\ndevelopers appreciate its value. Effective teaching requires a clear\nunderstanding of student knowledge and progress. Our methods enable a rich and\nautomated analysis of student performance on PBT that yields insight into their\nunderstanding and can capture misconceptions. We therefore expect these results\nto be valuable to educators.",

    "abstract": "DIVeR builds on the key ideas of NeRF and its variants -- density models and\nvolume rendering -- to learn 3D object models that can be rendered\nrealistically from small numbers of images. In contrast to all previous NeRF\nmethods, DIVeR uses deterministic rather than stochastic estimates of the\nvolume rendering integral. DIVeR's representation is a voxel based field of\nfeatures. To compute the volume rendering integral, a ray is broken into\nintervals, one per voxel; components of the volume rendering integral are\nestimated from the features for each interval using an MLP, and the components\nare aggregated. As a result, DIVeR can render thin translucent structures that\nare missed by other integrators. Furthermore, DIVeR's representation has\nsemantics that is relatively exposed compared to other such methods -- moving\nfeature vectors around in the voxel space results in natural edits. Extensive\nqualitative and quantitative comparisons to current state-of-the-art methods\nshow that DIVeR produces models that (1) render at or above state-of-the-art\nquality, (2) are very small without being baked, (3) render very fast without\nbeing baked, and (4) can be edited in natural ways.",

In particular, in EHR\ndata, some variables are {\\em missing not at random (MNAR)} but deliberately\nnot collected and thus are a source of information. For example, lab tests may\nbe deemed necessary for some patients on the basis of suspected diagnosis, but\nnot for others. Here we present the MURAL forest -- an unsupervised random\nforest for representing data with disparate variable types (e.g., categorical,\ncontinuous, MNAR). MURAL forests consist of a set of decision trees where\nnode-splitting variables are chosen at random, such that the marginal entropy\nof all other variables is minimized by the split.

For\nlarge-scale structures with irregular geometry, customizing individual nodes to\nmeet exact member orientations and force demands may be infeasible; conversely,\nstandardizing all connections results in oversized nodes and a compromise in\nregistration potential.

A buyer either participates\ndirectly in the auction or is represented by an intermediary, who represents a\nsubset of buyers. Our goal is to design robust mechanisms that are independent\nof the demand structure (i.e. how the buyers are partitioned across\nintermediaries), and perform well under a wide variety of possible contracts\nbetween intermediaries and buyers.\nWe first study the case of $k$ identical items where each buyer draws its\nprivate valuation for an item i.i.d. from a known $\\lambda$-regular\ndistribution. We construct a robust mechanism that, independent of the demand\nstructure and under certain conditions on the contracts between intermediaries\nand buyers, obtains a constant factor of the revenue that the mechanism\ndesigner could obtain had she known the buyers' valuations. In other words, our\nmechanism's expected revenue achieves a constant factor of the optimal welfare,\nregardless of the demand structure. Our mechanism is a simple posted-price\nmechanism that sets a take-it-or-leave-it per-item price that depends on $k$\nand the total number of buyers, but does not depend on the demand structure or\nthe downstream contracts.\nNext we generalize our result to the case when the items are not identical.\nWe assume that the item valuations are separable. For this case, we design a\nmechanism that obtains at least a constant fraction of the optimal welfare, by\nusing a menu of posted prices.

    "abstract": "Adversarial patch attack aims to fool a machine learning model by arbitrarily\nmodifying pixels within a restricted region of an input image. Such attacks are\na major threat to models deployed in the physical world, as they can be easily\nrealized by presenting a customized object in the camera view. Defending\nagainst such attacks is challenging due to the arbitrariness of patches, and\nexisting provable defenses suffer from poor certified accuracy. In this paper,\nwe propose PatchVeto, a zero-shot certified defense against adversarial patches\nbased on Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Rather than training a robust model\nto resist adversarial patches which may inevitably sacrifice accuracy,\nPatchVeto reuses a pretrained ViT model without any additional training, which\ncan achieve high accuracy on clean inputs while detecting adversarial patched\ninputs by simply manipulating the attention map of ViT. Specifically, each\ninput is tested by voting over multiple inferences with different attention\nmasks, where at least one inference is guaranteed to exclude the adversarial\npatch. The prediction is certifiably robust if all masked inferences reach\nconsensus, which ensures that any adversarial patch would be detected with no\nfalse negative. Extensive experiments have shown that PatchVeto is able to\nachieve high certified accuracy (e.g. 67.1% on ImageNet for 2%-pixel\nadversarial patches), significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The\nclean accuracy is the same as vanilla ViT models (81.8% on ImageNet) since the\nmodel parameters are directly reused.

To solve this problem, research has\nfocused on leveraging deep learning techniques that help reduce false alerts.\nHowever, a shortcoming is that these works often require or implicitly assume\nthe physical and cyber sensors to be trustworthy. Implicit trust of data is a\nmajor problem with using artificial intelligence or machine learning for CPS\nsecurity, because during critical attack detection time they are more at risk,\nwith greater likelihood and impact, of also being compromised. To address this\nshortcoming, the problem is reframed on how to make good decisions given\nuncertainty. Then, the decision is detection, and the uncertainty includes\nwhether the data used for ML-based IDS is compromised. Thus, this work presents\nan approach for reducing false alerts in CPS power systems by dealing\nuncertainty without the knowledge of prior distribution of alerts.\nSpecifically, an evidence theoretic based approach leveraging Dempster Shafer\ncombination rules are proposed for reducing false alerts. A multi-hypothesis\nmass function model is designed that leverages probability scores obtained from\nvarious supervised-learning classifiers. Using this model, a\nlocation-cum-domain based fusion framework is proposed and evaluated with\ndifferent combination rules, that fuse multiple evidence from inter-domain and\nintra-domain sensors. The approach is demonstrated in a cyber-physical power\nsystem testbed with Man-In-The-Middle attack emulation in a large-scale\nsynthetic electric grid. For evaluating the performance, plausibility, belief,\npignistic, etc. metrics as decision functions are considered. To improve the\nperformance, a multi-objective based genetic algorithm is proposed for feature\nselection considering the decision metrics as the fitness function.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables a group of clients to jointly train a machine\nlearning model with the help of a centralized server. Clients do not need to\nsubmit their local data to the server during training, and hence the local\ntraining data of clients is protected. In FL, distributed clients collect their\nlocal data independently, so the dataset of each client may naturally form a\ndistinct source domain. In practice, the model trained over multiple source\ndomains may have poor generalization performance on unseen target domains. To\naddress this issue, we propose FedADG to equip federated learning with domain\ngeneralization capability. FedADG employs the federated adversarial learning\napproach to measure and align the distributions among different source domains\nvia matching each distribution to a reference distribution. The reference\ndistribution is adaptively generated (by accommodating all source domains) to\nminimize the domain shift distance during alignment. In FedADG, the alignment\nis fine-grained since each class is aligned independently. In this way, the\nlearned feature representation is supposed to be universal, so it can\ngeneralize well on the unseen domains. Extensive experiments on various\ndatasets demonstrate that FedADG has better performance than most of the\nprevious solutions even if they have an additional advantage that allows\ncentralized data access.

    "title": "Imitation and Supervised Learning of Compliance for Robotic Assembly",
    "abstract": "We present the design of a learning-based compliance controller for assembly\noperations for industrial robots. We propose a solution within the general\nsetting of learning from demonstration (LfD), where a nominal trajectory is\nprovided through demonstration by an expert teacher. This can be used to learn\na suitable representation of the skill that can be generalized to novel\npositions of one of the parts involved in the assembly, for example the hole in\na peg-in-hole (PiH) insertion task. Under the expectation that this novel\nposition might not be entirely accurately estimated by a vision or other\nsensing system, the robot will need to further modify the generated trajectory\nin response to force readings measured by means of a force-torque (F/T) sensor\nmounted at the wrist of the robot or another suitable location. Under the\nassumption of constant velocity of traversing the reference trajectory during\nassembly, we propose a novel accommodation force controller that allows the\nrobot to safely explore different contact configurations. The data collected\nusing this controller is used to train a Gaussian process model to predict the\nmisalignment in the position of the peg with respect to the target hole. We\nshow that the proposed learning-based approach can correct various contact\nconfigurations caused by misalignment between the assembled parts in a PiH\ntask, achieving high success rate during insertion. We show results using an\nindustrial manipulator arm, and demonstrate that the proposed method can\nperform adaptive insertion using force feedback from the trained machine\nlearning models.",

    "abstract": "Livestream shopping is getting more and more popular as a new shopping form.\nAlso, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people have shifted to online shopping\nplatforms. However, the broader user adoption comes with a cost -- many\nstreamers' malicious selling incidents have recently been reported. In this\nstudy, we aim to explore streamers' malicious selling strategies and how\nviewers may perceive these strategies. First, we collected 40 livestream\nshopping sessions from two popular livestream platforms in China -- Taobao and\nDouyin (TikTok of Chinese version). We identified three categories of malicious\nselling strategies (i.e., Compulsive, Restrictive, and Designing) and found\nplatform designs mostly enhanced these malicious selling strategies. Second,\nthrough an interview study with 13 end users, we provide a rich description of\nusers' awareness of malicious selling strategies and challenges to counter\nmalicious selling. We conclude the paper by discussing the policy and design\nimplications to counter malicious selling.",

To address this\ndeficiency, we present a simple and effective architecture modification to\nViT's input layer by adding discrete tokens produced by a vector-quantized\nencoder.

Previous methods either employ\na complex pipeline which splits the joint task into independent stages, or fuse\n2D and 3D information in an ``early-fusion'' or ``late-fusion'' manner. Such\none-size-fits-all approaches suffer from a dilemma of failing to fully utilize\nthe characteristic of each modality or to maximize the inter-modality\ncomplementarity. To address the problem, we propose a novel end-to-end\nframework, called CamLiFlow. It consists of 2D and 3D branches with multiple\nbidirectional connections between them in specific layers.

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis of static scenes has achieved remarkable advancements in\nproducing photo-realistic results. However, key challenges remain for immersive\nrendering for dynamic contents. For example, one of the seminal image-based\nrendering frameworks, the multi-plane image (MPI) produces high novel-view\nsynthesis quality for static scenes but faces difficulty in modeling dynamic\nparts. In addition, modeling dynamic variations through MPI may require huge\nstorage space and long inference time, which hinders its application in\nreal-time scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Temporal-MPI\nrepresentation which is able to encode the rich 3D and dynamic variation\ninformation throughout the entire video as compact temporal basis. Novel-views\nat arbitrary time-instance will be able to be rendered real-time with high\nvisual quality due to the highly compact and expressive latent basis and the\ncoefficients jointly learned. We show that given comparable memory consumption,\nour proposed Temporal-MPI framework is able to generate a time-instance MPI\nwith only 0.002 seconds, which is up to 3000 times faster, with 3dB higher\naverage view-synthesis PSNR as compared with other state-of-the-art dynamic\nscene modelling frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolution Network (GCN) has been widely applied in recommender\nsystems for its representation learning capability on user and item embeddings.\nHowever, GCN is vulnerable to noisy and incomplete graphs, which are common in\nreal world, due to its recursive message propagation mechanism. In the\nliterature, some work propose to remove the feature transformation during\nmessage propagation, but making it unable to effectively capture the graph\nstructural features. Moreover, they model users and items in the Euclidean\nspace, which has been demonstrated to have high distortion when modeling\ncomplex graphs, further degrading the capability to capture the graph\nstructural features and leading to sub-optimal performance. To this end, in\nthis paper, we propose a simple yet effective Quaternion-based Graph\nConvolution Network (QGCN) recommendation model. In the proposed model, we\nutilize the hyper-complex Quaternion space to learn user and item\nrepresentations and feature transformation to improve both performance and\nrobustness. Specifically, we first embed all users and items into the\nQuaternion space. Then, we introduce the quaternion embedding propagation\nlayers with quaternion feature transformation to perform message propagation.\nFinally, we combine the embeddings generated at each layer with the mean\npooling strategy to obtain the final embeddings for recommendation. Extensive\nexperiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed\nQGCN model outperforms baseline methods by a large margin.",

Yet,\nas most try-on approaches fit in-shop garments onto a target person, they\nrequire the laborious and restrictive construction of a paired training\ndataset, severely limiting their scalability. While a few recent works attempt\nto transfer garments directly from one person to another, alleviating the need\nto collect paired datasets, their performance is impacted by the lack of paired\n(supervised) information. In particular, disentangling style and spatial\ninformation of the garment becomes a challenge, which existing methods either\naddress by requiring auxiliary data or extensive online optimization\nprocedures, thereby still inhibiting their scalability. To achieve a\n\\emph{scalable} virtual try-on system that can transfer arbitrary garments\nbetween a source and a target person in an unsupervised manner, we thus propose\na texture-preserving end-to-end network, the PAtch-routed SpaTially-Adaptive\nGAN (PASTA-GAN), that facilitates real-world unpaired virtual try-on.\nSpecifically, to disentangle the style and spatial information of each garment,\nPASTA-GAN consists of an innovative patch-routed disentanglement module for\nsuccessfully retaining garment texture and shape characteristics. Guided by the\nsource person keypoints, the patch-routed disentanglement module first\ndecouples garments into normalized patches, thus eliminating the inherent\nspatial information of the garment, and then reconstructs the normalized\npatches to the warped garment complying with the target person pose.

    "abstract": "The metaverse is regarded as a new wave of technological transformation that\nprovides a virtual space for people to interact with each other through digital\navatars. To achieve immersive user experiences in the metaverse, real-time\nrendering is the key technology. However, computing intensive tasks of\nreal-time graphic and audio rendering from metaverse service providers cannot\nbe processed efficiently on a single resource-limited mobile and Internet of\nThings (IoT) device. Alternatively, such devices can adopt the collaborative\ncomputing paradigm based on Coded Distributed Computing (CDC) to support\nmetaverse services. Therefore, this paper introduces a reliable collaborative\nCDC framework for metaverse. In the framework, idle resources from mobile\ndevices, acting as CDC workers, are aggregated to handle intensive computation\ntasks in the metaverse. A coalition can be formed among reliable workers based\non a reputation metric which is maintained in a double blockchains database.\nThe framework also considers an incentive to attract reliable workers to\nparticipate and process computation tasks of metaverse services. Moreover, the\nframework is designed with a hierarchical structure composed of coalition\nformation and Stackelberg games in the lower and upper levels to determine\nstable coalitions and rewards for reliable workers, respectively. The\nsimulation results illustrate that the proposed framework is resistant to\nmalicious workers.

    "abstract": "Human performance capture is a highly important computer vision problem with\nmany applications in movie production and virtual/augmented reality. Many\nprevious performance capture approaches either required expensive multi-view\nsetups or did not recover dense space-time coherent geometry with\nframe-to-frame correspondences. We propose a novel deep learning approach for\nmonocular dense human performance capture. Our method is trained in a weakly\nsupervised manner based on multi-view supervision completely removing the need\nfor training data with 3D ground truth annotations. The network architecture is\nbased on two separate networks that disentangle the task into a pose estimation\nand a non-rigid surface deformation step. Extensive qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms the state of the\nart in terms of quality and robustness. This work is an extended version of\nDeepCap where we provide more detailed explanations, comparisons and results as\nwell as applications.",

We validate the performance of our proposed democratic spectrum\nsharing (DSS) algorithm over real-world Wi-Fi networks and on synthetically\ngenerated networks with varying design parameters. Compared to the greedy\napproach, DSS achieves significant gains in throughput (~60%), area spectral\nefficiency ($\\sim$50\\%) and fairness in datarate distribution (~20%).

    "abstract": "The field of meta-learning has seen a dramatic rise in interest in recent\nyears. In existing meta-learning approaches, learning tasks for training\nmeta-models are usually collected from public datasets, which brings the\ndifficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of meta-learning tasks with a large\namount of training data. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning approach\nbased on randomly generated meta-learning tasks to obtain a parametric loss for\nclassification learning based on big data. The loss is represented by a deep\nneural network, called meta-loss network (MLN). To train the MLN, we construct\na large number of classification learning tasks through randomly generating\ntraining data, validation data, and corresponding ground-truth linear\nclassifier. Our approach has two advantages. First, sufficient meta-learning\ntasks with large number of training data can be obtained easily. Second, the\nground-truth classifier is given, so that the difference between the learned\nclassifier and the ground-truth model can be measured to reflect the\nperformance of MLN more precisely than validation accuracy. Based on this\ndifference, we apply the evolutionary strategy algorithm to find out the\noptimal MLN. The resultant MLN not only leads to satisfactory learning effects\non generated linear classifier learning tasks for testing, but also behaves\nvery well on generated nonlinear classifier learning tasks and various public\nclassification tasks. Our MLN stably surpass cross-entropy (CE) and mean square\nerror (MSE) in testing accuracy and generalization ability. These results\nillustrate the possibility of achieving satisfactory meta-learning effects\nusing generated learning tasks.",

    "abstract": "Managed analytics frameworks (e.g., Spark) cache intermediate results in\nmemory (on-heap) or storage devices (off-heap) to avoid costly recomputations,\nespecially in graph processing. As datasets grow, on-heap caching requires more\nmemory for long-lived objects, resulting in high garbage collection (GC)\noverhead. On the other hand, off-heap caching moves cached objects on the\nstorage device, reducing GC overhead, but at the cost of serialization and\ndeserialization (S/D). In this work, we propose TeraHeap, a novel approach for\nproviding large analytics caches. TeraHeap uses two heaps within the JVM (1) a\ngarbage-collected heap for ordinary Spark objects and (2) a large heap\nmemory-mapped over fast storage devices for cached objects. TeraHeap eliminates\nboth S/D and GC over cached data without imposing any language restrictions. We\nimplement TeraHeap in Oracle's Java runtime (OpenJDK-1.8). We use five popular,\nmemory-intensive graph analytics workloads to understand S/D and GC overheads\nand evaluate TeraHeap. TeraHeap improves total execution time compared to\nstate-of-the-art Apache Spark configurations by up to 72% and 81% for NVMe SSD\nand non-volatile memory, respectively. Furthermore, TeraCache requires 8x less\nDRAM capacity to provide performance comparable or higher than native Spark.\nThis paper opens up emerging memory and storage devices for practical use in\nscalable analytics caching.",

Whereas previous research has focused on the\npropagation of unreliable sources as a main vehicle of misinformation, the\npresent study focuses on exploring the role of scientists whose views oppose\nthe scientific consensus. Using Nobelists in Physiology and Medicine as a proxy\nfor scientific consensus, we analyze two separate datasets: 15.8K tweets by\n13.1K unique users on COVID-19 vaccines specifically, and 208K tweets by 151K\nunique users on COVID-19 broadly which mention the Nobelist names. Our analyses\nreveal that dissenting scientists are amplified by a factor of 426 relative to\ntrue scientific consensus in the context of COVID-19 vaccines, and by a factor\nof 43 in the context of COVID-19 generally. Although more popular accounts tend\nto mention consensus-abiding scientists more, our results suggest that this\nfalse consensus is driven by higher engagement with dissent-mentioning tweets.\nFurthermore, false consensus mostly occurs due to traffic spikes following\nhighly popularized statements of dissenting scientists. We find that dissenting\nvoices are mainly discussed in French, English-speaking, Turkish, Brazilian,\nArgentine, Indian, and Japanese misinformation clusters. This research suggests\nthat social media platforms should prioritize the exposure of consensus-abiding\nscientists as a vehicle of reversing false consensus and addressing\nmisinformation stemming from seemingly credible sources.",

To achieve safe multi-task learning where no\n\\textit{negative sharing} occurs, we propose a Safe Multi-Task Learning (SMTL)\nmodel, which consists of a public encoder shared by all the tasks, private\nencoders, gates, and private decoders. Specifically, each task has a private\nencoder, a gate, and a private decoder, where the gate is to learn how to\ncombine the private encoder and public encoder for the downstream private\ndecoder. To reduce the storage cost during the inference stage, a lite version\nof SMTL is proposed to allow the gate to choose either the public encoder or\nthe corresponding private encoder.

    "abstract": "Pixel binning is a technique, widely used in optical image acquisition and\nspectroscopy, in which adjacent detector elements of an image sensor are\ncombined into larger pixels. This reduces the amount of data to be processed as\nwell as the impact of noise, but comes at the cost of a loss of information.\nHere, we push the concept of binning to its limit by combining a large fraction\nof the sensor elements into a single superpixel that extends over the whole\nface of the chip. For a given pattern recognition task, its optimal shape is\ndetermined from training data using a machine learning algorithm. We\ndemonstrate the classification of optically projected images from the MNIST\ndataset on a nanosecond timescale, with enhanced sensitivity and without loss\nof classification accuracy. Our concept is not limited to imaging alone but can\nalso be applied in optical spectroscopy or other sensing applications.",

We study power control in both the downlink\nand the uplink of such a scenario when partial zero-forcing (PZF)\ntransmit/receive beamforming and maximum ratio transmission/combining are\nutilized. We consider optimization problems where the objective is either to\nmaximize the total users' sum URLLC rate or to maximize the minimum user's\nURLLC rate. The considered URLLC rate function is both complicated and\nnonconvex rendering the considered optimization problems nonconvex. Thus, we\npresent two approximations for the URLLC rate function and resort to successive\nconvex optimization (SCO) to tackle the considered optimization problems.\nParticularly, we present SCO with iterative concave lower bound approximation\n(SCO-ICBA) and SCO with iterative interference approximation (SCO-IIA).

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods\nare appropriate for supporting the legitimacy of the public policies that\nsupply public goods at the cost of individual interests. Among these policies,\nthe inter-regional collaborative pandemic control is a prominent example, which\nhas become much more important for an increasingly inter-connected world facing\na global pandemic like COVID-19. Different patterns of collaborative strategies\nhave been observed among different systems of regions, yet it lacks an\nanalytical process to reason for the legitimacy of those strategies. In this\npaper, we use the inter-regional collaboration for pandemic control as an\nexample to demonstrate the necessity of MARL in reasoning, and thereby\nlegitimizing policies enforcing such inter-regional collaboration. Experimental\nresults in an exemplary environment show that our MARL approach is able to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of restrictions on individual\nliberty for collaborative supply of public goods. Different optimal policies\nare learned by our MARL agents under different collaboration levels, which\nchange in an interpretable pattern of collaboration that helps to balance the\nlosses suffered by regions of different types, and consequently promotes the\noverall welfare. Meanwhile, policies learned with higher collaboration levels\nyield higher global rewards, which illustrates the benefit of, and thus\nprovides a novel justification for the legitimacy of, promoting inter-regional\ncollaboration.

    "abstract": "This study develops a unified Point Cloud Geometry (PCG) compression method\nthrough Sparse Tensor Processing (STP) based multiscale representation of\nvoxelized PCG, dubbed as the SparsePCGC. Applying the STP reduces the\ncomplexity significantly because it only performs the convolutions centered at\nMost-Probable Positively-Occupied Voxels (MP-POV). And the multiscale\nrepresentation facilitates us to compress scale-wise MP-POVs progressively. The\noverall compression efficiency highly depends on the approximation accuracy of\noccupancy probability of each MP-POV. Thus, we design the Sparse Convolution\nbased Neural Networks (SparseCNN) consisting of sparse convolutions and voxel\nre-sampling to extensively exploit priors. We then develop the SparseCNN based\nOccupancy Probability Approximation (SOPA) model to estimate the occupancy\nprobability in a single-stage manner only using the cross-scale prior or in\nmulti-stage by step-wisely utilizing autoregressive neighbors. Besides, we also\nsuggest the SparseCNN based Local Neighborhood Embedding (SLNE) to characterize\nthe local spatial variations as the feature attribute to improve the SOPA.

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, numerous attempts have been made to address the\nproblem of recovering a high-resolution (HR) facial image from its\ncorresponding low-resolution (LR) counterpart, a task commonly referred to as\nface hallucination. Despite the impressive performance achieved by\nposition-patch and deep learning-based methods, most of these techniques are\nstill unable to recover identity-specific features of faces. The former group\nof algorithms often produces blurry and oversmoothed outputs particularly in\nthe presence of higher levels of degradation, whereas the latter generates\nfaces which sometimes by no means resemble the individuals in the input images.\nIn this paper, a novel face super-resolution approach will be introduced, in\nwhich the hallucinated face is forced to lie in a subspace spanned by the\navailable training faces. Therefore, in contrast to the majority of existing\nface hallucination techniques and thanks to this face subspace prior, the\nreconstruction is performed in favor of recovering person-specific facial\nfeatures, rather than merely increasing image quantitative scores. Furthermore,\ninspired by recent advances in the area of 3D face reconstruction, an efficient\n3D dictionary alignment scheme is also presented, through which the algorithm\nbecomes capable of dealing with low-resolution faces taken in uncontrolled\nconditions. In extensive experiments carried out on several well-known face\ndatasets, the proposed algorithm shows remarkable performance by generating\ndetailed and close to ground truth results which outperform the\nstate-of-the-art face hallucination algorithms by significant margins both in\nquantitative and qualitative evaluations.",

The training process of DNN models\ngenerally handles large-scale input data with many sparse features, which\nincurs high Input/Output (IO) cost, while some layers are compute-intensive.\nThe training process generally exploits distributed computing resources to\nreduce training time. In addition, heterogeneous computing resources, e.g.,\nCPUs, GPUs of multiple types, are available for the distributed training\nprocess. Thus, the scheduling of multiple layers to diverse computing resources\nis critical for the training process. To efficiently train a DNN model using\nthe heterogeneous computing resources, we propose a distributed framework,\ni.e., Paddle-Heterogeneous Parameter Server (Paddle-HeterPS), composed of a\ndistributed architecture and a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based scheduling\nmethod. The advantages of Paddle-HeterPS are three-fold compared with existing\nframeworks.

Second, Paddle-HeterPS\nexploits an RL-based method to efficiently schedule the workload of each layer\nto appropriate computing resources to minimize the cost while satisfying\nthroughput constraints. Third, Paddle-HeterPS manages data storage and data\ncommunication among distributed computing resources. We carry out extensive\nexperiments to show that Paddle-HeterPS significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches in terms of throughput (14.5 times higher) and\nmonetary cost (312.3% smaller).

    "abstract": "Printers are common devices whose networked use is vastly unsecured, perhaps\ndue to an enrooted assumption that their services are somewhat negligible and,\nas such, unworthy of protection. This article develops structured arguments and\nconducts technical experiments in support of a qualitative risk assessment\nexercise that ultimately undermines that assumption. Three attacks that can be\ninterpreted as post-exploitation activity are found and discussed, forming what\nwe term the Printjack family of attacks to printers. Some printers may suffer\nvulnerabilities that would transform them into exploitable zombies. Moreover, a\nlarge number of printers, at least on an EU basis, are found to honour\nunauthenticated printing requests, thus raising the risk level of an attack\nthat sees the crooks exhaust the printing facilities of an institution. There\nis also a remarkable risk of data breach following an attack consisting in the\nmalicious interception of data while in transit towards printers. Therefore,\nthe newborn IoT era demands printers to be as secure as other devices such as\nlaptops should be, also to facilitate compliance with the General Data\nProtection Regulation (EU Regulation 2016/679) and reduce the odds of its\nadministrative fines.",

Two types of support\nsystems by AHOBO were implemented to support the elderly in both physical\nhealth and psychological aspects.

For psychological frailty care, we implemented reminiscent coloring\nwith the AHOBO as a recreational activity with the robot. The usability of the\nsystem was evaluated based on the assumption of continuous use in daily life.\nFor the support system in blood pressure measurement, we performed a\nqualitative evaluation using a questionnaire for 16 subjects, including elderly\npeople under blood pressure measurement by the system. The results confirmed\nthat the proposed robot does not affect the blood pressure readings and is\nacceptable in terms of ease of use based on subjective evaluation. For the\nreminiscent coloring interaction, a subjective evaluation was conducted on two\nelderly people under the verbal fluency task, and it has been confirmed that\nthe interaction can be used continuously in daily life.

To this aim, the flow\nparameter are described by the velocity, the density and the internal energy.\nThe thermodynamic quantities are described on the elements of the mesh, and\nthis the approximation is only $L^2$, while the kinematic quantities are\nglobally continuous. The method is general in the sense that the\nthermodynamical and kinetic parameters are described by arbitrary degree\npolynomials, in practice the difference between the degrees of the kinematic\nparameters and the thermodynamical ones is equal to $1$. The integration in\ntime is done using a defect correction method. As such, there is no hope that\nthe limit solution, if it exists, will be a weak solution of the problem. In\norder to guaranty this property, we introduce a general correction method in\nthe spirit of the Lagrangian stagered method described in\n\\cite{Svetlana,MR4059382, MR3023731}, and we prove a Lax Wendroff theorem.

    "abstract": "The phase-field fracture free-energy functional is non-convex with respect to\nthe displacement and the phase field. This results in a poor performance of the\nconventional monolithic solvers like the Newton-Raphson method. In order to\ncircumvent this issue, researchers opt for the alternate minimization\n(staggered) solvers. Staggered solvers are robust for the phase-field based\nfracture simulations as the displacement and the phase-field sub-problems are\nconvex in nature. Nevertheless, the staggered solver requires very large number\nof iterations (of the order of thousands) to converge. In this work, a robust\nmonolithic solver is presented for the phase-field fracture problem. The solver\nadopts a fracture energy-based arc-length method and an adaptive\nunder-relaxation scheme. The arc-length method enables the simulation to\novercome critical points (snap-back, snap-through instabilities) during the\nloading of a specimen. The use of an under-relaxation scheme stabilizes the\nsolver by preventing the divergence due to an ill-behaving stiffness matrix.\nThe efficiency of the proposed solver is further amplified with an adaptive\nmesh refinement scheme based on PHT-splines within the framework of\nisogeometric analysis. The numerical examples presented in the manuscript\ndemonstrates the efficacy of the solver.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are proposed without considering the agnostic\ndistribution shifts between training and testing graphs, inducing the\ndegeneration of the generalization ability of GNNs on Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)\nsettings. The fundamental reason for such degeneration is that most GNNs are\ndeveloped based on the I.I.D hypothesis. In such a setting, GNNs tend to\nexploit subtle statistical correlations existing in the training set for\npredictions, even though it is a spurious correlation. However, such spurious\ncorrelations may change in testing environments, leading to the failure of\nGNNs. Therefore, eliminating the impact of spurious correlations is crucial for\nstable GNNs. To this end, we propose a general causal representation framework,\ncalled StableGNN. The main idea is to extract high-level representations from\ngraph data first and resort to the distinguishing ability of causal inference\nto help the model get rid of spurious correlations. Particularly, we exploit a\ngraph pooling layer to extract subgraph-based representations as high-level\nrepresentations. Furthermore, we propose a causal variable distinguishing\nregularizer to correct the biased training distribution. Hence, GNNs would\nconcentrate more on the stable correlations.

In this regard, a greedy heuristic may be used that\nintuitively selects traffic elements in sequence from static traffic demand\nmatrix and attempts to find the best solution.

The Q-learning method is used to decide the\nsuitable sequence of traffic allocation such that the overall power consumption\nin the network reduces.

    "abstract": "The recent advances in Vision Transformer (ViT) have demonstrated its\nimpressive performance in image classification, which makes it a promising\nalternative to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Unlike CNNs, ViT represents\nan input image as a sequence of image patches. The patch-wise input image\nrepresentation makes the following question interesting: How does ViT perform\nwhen individual input image patches are perturbed with natural corruptions or\nadversarial perturbations, compared to CNNs? In this work, we study the\nrobustness of vision transformers to patch-wise perturbations. Surprisingly, we\nfind that vision transformers are more robust to naturally corrupted patches\nthan CNNs, whereas they are more vulnerable to adversarial patches.\nFurthermore, we conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to\nunderstand the robustness to patch perturbations. We have revealed that ViT's\nstronger robustness to natural corrupted patches and higher vulnerability\nagainst adversarial patches are both caused by the attention mechanism.\nSpecifically, the attention model can help improve the robustness of vision\ntransformers by effectively ignoring natural corrupted patches. However, when\nvision transformers are attacked by an adversary, the attention mechanism can\nbe easily fooled to focus more on the adversarially perturbed patches and cause\na mistake.",

In this work, we attempt to incorporate these findings into the theory\nof mechanism design. We consider players that have a preference for\ntruth-telling and will only lie if their benefit from lying is sufficiently\nlarger than the loss of the others. To accommodate such players, we introduce\n$\\alpha$-moral mechanisms, in which the gain of a player from misreporting his\ntrue value, comparing to truth-telling, is at most $\\alpha$ times the loss that\nthe others incur due to misreporting.\nWe develop a theory of moral mechanisms in the canonical setting of\nsingle-item auctions. We identify similarities and disparities to the standard\ntheory of truthful mechanisms. In particular, we show that the allocation\nfunction does not uniquely determine the payments and is unlikely to admit a\nsimple characterization. In contrast, recall that monotonicity characterizes\nthe allocation function of truthful mechanisms.\nOur main technical effort is invested in determining whether the auctioneer\ncan exploit the preference for truth-telling of the players to extract more\nrevenue comparing to truthful mechanisms. We show that the auctioneer can\nextract more revenue when the values of the players are correlated, even when\nthere are only two players. However, we show that truthful mechanisms are\nrevenue-maximizing even among moral ones when the values of the players are\nindependently drawn from certain identical distributions. As a by product we\nget an alternative proof to Myerson's characterization in the settings that we\nconsider.

    "abstract": "The single-hidden-layer Randomly Weighted Feature Network (RWFN) introduced\nby Hong and Pavlic (2021) was developed as an alternative to neural tensor\nnetwork approaches for relational learning tasks. Its relatively small\nfootprint combined with the use of two randomized input projections -- an\ninsect-brain-inspired input representation and random Fourier features -- allow\nit to achieve rich expressiveness for relational learning with relatively low\ntraining cost. In particular, when Hong and Pavlic compared RWFN to Logic\nTensor Networks (LTNs) for Semantic Image Interpretation (SII) tasks to extract\nstructured semantic descriptions from images, they showed that the RWFN\nintegration of the two hidden, randomized representations better captures\nrelationships among inputs with a faster training process even though it uses\nfar fewer learnable parameters. In this paper, we use RWFNs to perform Visual\nRelationship Detection (VRD) tasks, which are more challenging SII tasks. A\nzero-shot learning approach is used with RWFN that can exploit similarities\nwith other seen relationships and background knowledge -- expressed with\nlogical constraints between subjects, relations, and objects -- to achieve the\nability to predict triples that do not appear in the training set. The\nexperiments on the Visual Relationship Dataset to compare the performance\nbetween RWFNs and LTNs, one of the leading Statistical Relational Learning\nframeworks, show that RWFNs outperform LTNs for the predicate-detection task\nwhile using fewer number of adaptable parameters (1:56 ratio). Furthermore,\nbackground knowledge represented by RWFNs can be used to alleviate the\nincompleteness of training sets even though the space complexity of RWFNs is\nmuch smaller than LTNs (1:27 ratio).",

However, most of the existing graph neural networks (GNNs) heavily\nrely on labeling information, which is normally expensive to obtain in the real\nworld. Existing unsupervised GRL methods suffer from certain limitations, such\nas the heavy reliance on monotone contrastiveness and limited scalability. To\novercome the aforementioned problems, in light of the recent advancements in\ngraph contrastive learning, we introduce a novel self-supervised graph\nrepresentation learning algorithm via Graph Contrastive Adjusted Zooming,\nnamely G-Zoom, to learn node representations by leveraging the proposed\nadjusted zooming scheme. Specifically, this mechanism enables G-Zoom to explore\nand extract self-supervision signals from a graph from multiple scales: micro\n(i.e., node-level), meso (i.e., neighbourhood-level), and macro (i.e.,\nsubgraph-level). Firstly, we generate two augmented views of the input graph\nvia two different graph augmentations. Then, we establish three different\ncontrastiveness on the above three scales progressively, from node,\nneighbouring, to subgraph level, where we maximize the agreement between graph\nrepresentations across scales. While we can extract valuable clues from a given\ngraph on the micro and macro perspectives, the neighbourhood-level\ncontrastiveness offers G-Zoom the capability of a customizable option based on\nour adjusted zooming scheme to manually choose an optimal viewpoint that lies\nbetween the micro and macro perspectives to better understand the graph data.\nAdditionally, to make our model scalable to large graphs, we employ a parallel\ngraph diffusion approach to decouple model training from the graph size.

We first present the direct FIFO mechanism,\nwhich offers lower-earning trips to drivers further down the queue. The option\nto skip the rest of the line incentivizes drivers to accept all dispatches, but\nthe mechanism would be considered unfair since drivers closer to the head of\nthe queue may have lower priority for trips to certain destinations. To avoid\nthe use of unfair dispatch rules, we introduce a family of randomized FIFO\nmechanisms, which send declined trips gradually down the queue in a randomized\nmanner. We prove that a randomized FIFO mechanism achieves the first best\nthroughput and the second best revenue in equilibrium.

The\nproblem is therefore analogous to binary classification, with the important\ndifference that the objective is to estimate probabilities rather than\npredicting the specific outcome. The goal of this work is to investigate\nprobability estimation from high-dimensional data using deep neural networks.\nThere exist several methods to improve the probabilities generated by these\nmodels but they mostly focus on classification problems where the probabilities\nare related to model uncertainty. In the case of problems with inherent\nuncertainty, it is challenging to evaluate performance without access to\nground-truth probabilities. To address this, we build a synthetic dataset to\nstudy and compare different computable metrics. We evaluate existing methods on\nthe synthetic data as well as on three real-world probability estimation tasks,\nall of which involve inherent uncertainty: precipitation forecasting from radar\nimages, predicting cancer patient survival from histopathology images, and\npredicting car crashes from dashcam videos. Finally, we also propose a new\nmethod for probability estimation using neural networks, which modifies the\ntraining process to promote output probabilities that are consistent with\nempirical probabilities computed from the data.

    "title": "COVID Induced Digital Inequality for Senior Citizens",
    "abstract": "The global pandemic of COVID-19 has fundamentally changed how people\ninteract, especially with the introduction of technology-based measures that\naim at curbing the spread of the virus. As the country that currently\nimplements one of the tightest technology-based COVID prevention policy, China\nhas protected its citizen with a prolonged peaceful time of zero case as well\nas a fast reaction to potential upsurging of the disease. However, such\nmobile-based technology does come with sacrifices, especially for senior\ncitizens who find themselves difficult to adapt to modern technologies. In this\nstudy, we demonstrated the fact that most senior citizens find it difficult to\nuse the health code apps called ''JKM'', to which they responded by cutting\ndown on travel and reducing local commuting to locations where the verification\nof JKM is needed. Such compromise has physical and mental consequences and\nleads to inequalities in infrastructure, social isolation and self-sufficiency.\nAs we illustrated in the paper, such decrease in life quality of senior\ncitizens can be greatly reduced if improvements on the user interactions of the\nJKM can be implemented. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first systemic\nstudy of digital inequality due to mobile-based COVID prevention technologies\nfor senior citizens in China. As similar technologies become widely adopted\naround the world, we wish to shed light on how widened digital inequality\nincreasingly affects the life quality of senior citizens in the pandemic era.",

    "abstract": "Referring image segmentation is a typical multi-modal task, which aims at\ngenerating a binary mask for referent described in given language expressions.\nPrior arts adopt a bimodal solution, taking images and languages as two\nmodalities within an encoder-fusion-decoder pipeline. However, this pipeline is\nsub-optimal for the target task for two reasons. First, they only fuse\nhigh-level features produced by uni-modal encoders separately, which hinders\nsufficient cross-modal learning. Second, the uni-modal encoders are pre-trained\nindependently, which brings inconsistency between pre-trained uni-modal tasks\nand the target multi-modal task. Besides, this pipeline often ignores or makes\nlittle use of intuitively beneficial instance-level features. To relieve these\nproblems, we propose MaIL, which is a more concise encoder-decoder pipeline\nwith a Mask-Image-Language trimodal encoder. Specifically, MaIL unifies\nuni-modal feature extractors and their fusion model into a deep modality\ninteraction encoder, facilitating sufficient feature interaction across\ndifferent modalities. Meanwhile, MaIL directly avoids the second limitation\nsince no uni-modal encoders are needed anymore. Moreover, for the first time,\nwe propose to introduce instance masks as an additional modality, which\nexplicitly intensifies instance-level features and promotes finer segmentation\nresults. The proposed MaIL set a new state-of-the-art on all frequently-used\nreferring image segmentation datasets, including RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and G-Ref,\nwith significant gains, 3%-10% against previous best methods. Code will be\nreleased soon.",

    "abstract": "Automatically learned vector representations of words, also known as \"word\nembeddings\", are becoming a basic building block for more and more natural\nlanguage processing algorithms. There are different ways and tools for\nconstructing word embeddings. Most of the approaches rely on raw texts, the\nconstruction items being the word occurrences and/or letter n-grams. More\nelaborated research is using additional linguistic features extracted after\ntext preprocessing. Morphology is clearly served by vector representations\nconstructed from raw texts and letter n-grams. Syntax and semantics studies may\nprofit more from the vector representations constructed with additional\nfeatures such as lemma, part-of-speech, syntactic or semantic dependants\nassociated with each word. One of the key objectives of the ReTeRom project is\nthe development of advanced technologies for Romanian natural language\nprocessing, including morphological, syntactic and semantic analysis of text.\nAs such, we plan to develop an open-access large library of ready-to-use word\nembeddings sets, each set being characterized by different parameters: used\nfeatures (wordforms, letter n-grams, lemmas, POSes etc.), vector lengths,\nwindow/context size and frequency thresholds. To this end, the previously\ncreated sets of word embeddings (based on word occurrences) on the CoRoLa\ncorpus (P\\u{a}i\\c{s} and Tufi\\c{s}, 2018) are and will be further augmented\nwith new representations learned from the same corpus by using specific\nfeatures such as lemmas and parts of speech.

In recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINN) have\nemerged as a novel method for solving differential equations. PINN method has\nthe advantage of being meshless, scalable, and can potentially be intelligent\nin terms of transferring the knowledge learned from solving one differential\nequation to the other. The exploration in this field has majorly been limited\nto solving linear-elasticity problems, crack propagation problems. This study\nuses PINNs to solve coupled thermo-mechanics problems of materials with\nfunctionally graded properties. An in-depth analysis of the PINN framework has\nbeen carried out by understanding the training datasets, model architecture,\nand loss functions. The efficacy of the PINN models in solving thermo-mechanics\ndifferential equations has been measured by comparing the obtained solutions\neither with analytical solutions or finite element method-based solutions.\nWhile R2 score of more than 99% has been achieved in predicting primary\nvariables such as displacement and temperature fields, achieving the same for\nsecondary variables such as stress turns out to be more challenging.

    "abstract": "The black-box adversarial attack has attracted impressive attention for its\npractical use in the field of deep learning security, meanwhile, it is very\nchallenging as there is no access to the network architecture or internal\nweights of the target model. Based on the hypothesis that if an example remains\nadversarial for multiple models, then it is more likely to transfer the attack\ncapability to other models, the ensemble-based adversarial attack methods are\nefficient and widely used for black-box attacks. However, ways of ensemble\nattack are rather less investigated, and existing ensemble attacks simply fuse\nthe outputs of all the models evenly. In this work, we treat the iterative\nensemble attack as a stochastic gradient descent optimization process, in which\nthe variance of the gradients on different models may lead to poor local\noptima. To this end, we propose a novel attack method called the stochastic\nvariance reduced ensemble (SVRE) attack, which could reduce the gradient\nvariance of the ensemble models and take full advantage of the ensemble attack.\nEmpirical results on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that the\nproposed method could boost the adversarial transferability and outperforms\nexisting ensemble attacks significantly.",

The server in a federated learning\n(FL) environment can fulfill any linear computation on private inputs of users\nthrough the secure linear aggregation. At present, based on pseudo-random\nnumber generator and one-time padding technique, one can efficiently compute\nthe sum of user inputs in FL, but linear calculations of user inputs are not\nwell supported. Based on decentralized threshold additive homomorphic\nencryption (DTAHE) schemes, this paper provides a secure linear aggregation\nprotocol, which allows the server to multiply the user inputs by any\ncoefficients and to sum them together, so that the server can build a full\nconnected layer or a convolution layer on top of user inputs.

The paper gives a security model, security proofs and a concrete\nlattice based DTAHE scheme for the protocol.

Inspired by the\ncrosslingual transfer and psycholinguistics literature, we propose a novel\nevaluation setting for V+L models: zero-shot cross-modal transfer. Existing V+L\nbenchmarks also often report global accuracy scores on the entire dataset,\nrendering it difficult to pinpoint the specific reasoning tasks that models\nfail and succeed at. To address this issue and enable the evaluation of\ncross-modal transfer, we present TraVLR, a synthetic dataset comprising four\nV+L reasoning tasks. Each example encodes the scene bimodally such that either\nmodality can be dropped during training/testing with no loss of relevant\ninformation. TraVLR's training and testing distributions are also constrained\nalong task-relevant dimensions, enabling the evaluation of out-of-distribution\ngeneralisation. We evaluate four state-of-the-art V+L models and find that\nalthough they perform well on the test set from the same modality, all models\nfail to transfer cross-modally and have limited success accommodating the\naddition or deletion of one modality. In alignment with prior work, we also\nfind these models to require large amounts of data to learn simple spatial\nrelationships. We release TraVLR as an open challenge for the research\ncommunity.",

Initially, researchers presented adversarial attacks in the digital\ndomain, and later the attacks were transferred to the physical domain. However,\nin many cases, attacks in the physical domain are conspicuous, requiring, for\nexample, the placement of a sticker on the face, and thus may raise suspicion\nin real-world environments (e.g., airports). In this paper, we propose\nAdversarial Mask, a physical adversarial universal perturbation (UAP) against\nstate-of-the-art FR models that is applied on face masks in the form of a\ncarefully crafted pattern. In our experiments, we examined the transferability\nof our adversarial mask to a wide range of FR model architectures and datasets.\nIn addition, we validated our adversarial mask effectiveness in real-world\nexperiments by printing the adversarial pattern on a fabric medical face mask,\ncausing the FR system to identify only 3.34% of the participants wearing the\nmask (compared to a minimum of 83.34% with other evaluated masks).",

However,\nexisting FL requires fully-labeled data for training, which is inconvenient or\nsometimes infeasible to obtain due to the high labeling cost and the\nrequirement of expertise. The lack of labels makes FL impractical in many\nrealistic settings. Self-supervised learning can address this challenge by\nlearning from unlabeled data such that FL can be widely used. Contrastive\nlearning (CL), a self-supervised learning approach, can effectively learn data\nrepresentations from unlabeled data. However, the distributed data collected on\nclients are usually not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) among\nclients, and each client may only have few classes of data, which degrades the\nperformance of CL and learned representations. To tackle this problem, we\npropose a federated contrastive learning framework consisting of two\napproaches: feature fusion and neighborhood matching, by which a unified\nfeature space among clients is learned for better data representations. Feature\nfusion provides remote features as accurate contrastive information to each\nclient for better local learning. Neighborhood matching further aligns each\nclient's local features to the remote features such that well-clustered\nfeatures among clients can be learned.

Hence, current endeavors propose fusing\nsocial information with user-item interactions to alleviate it, which is the\nsocial recommendation problem. Existing work employs GNNs to aggregate both\nsocial links and user-item interactions simultaneously. However, they all\nrequire centralized storage of the social links and item interactions of users,\nwhich leads to privacy concerns. Additionally, according to strict privacy\nprotection under General Data Protection Regulation, centralized data storage\nmay not be feasible in the future, urging a decentralized framework of social\nrecommendation. To this end, we devise a novel framework \\textbf{Fe}drated\n\\textbf{So}cial recommendation with \\textbf{G}raph neural network (FeSoG).\nFirstly, FeSoG adopts relational attention and aggregation to handle\nheterogeneity. Secondly, FeSoG infers user embeddings using local data to\nretain personalization. Last but not least, the proposed model employs\npseudo-labeling techniques with item sampling to protect the privacy and\nenhance training. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets justify\nthe effectiveness of FeSoG in completing social recommendation and privacy\nprotection. We are the first work proposing a federated learning framework for\nsocial recommendation to the best of our knowledge.",

The existing anchor-free methods\nusually have complex architectures and are not easy to deploy. Our goal is to\npropose an algorithm which is simple and easy-to-deploy for aerial image\ndetection. In this paper, we present a one-stage anchor-free rotated object\ndetector (FCOSR) based on FCOS, which can be deployed on most platforms. The\nFCOSR has a simple architecture consisting of only convolution layers. Our work\nfocuses on the label assignment strategy for the training phase. We use ellipse\ncenter sampling method to define a suitable sampling region for oriented\nbounding box (OBB). The fuzzy sample assignment strategy provides reasonable\nlabels for overlapping objects. To solve the insufficient sampling problem, a\nmulti-level sampling module is designed. These strategies allocate more\nappropriate labels to training samples. Our algorithm achieves 79.25, 75.41,\nand 90.15 mAP on DOTA1.0, DOTA1.5, and HRSC2016 datasets, respectively. FCOSR\ndemonstrates superior performance to other methods in single-scale evaluation.\nWe convert a lightweight FCOSR model to TensorRT format, which achieves 73.93\nmAP on DOTA1.0 at a speed of 10.68 FPS on Jetson Xavier NX with single scale.\nThe code is available at: https://github.com/lzh420202/FCOSR",

Currently available studies to quantify the potential gains of\ndeploying RISs in wireless networks are limited to simple network topologies,\nwhile no system-level assessments have been reported to date.

Towards this direction, this article\nreports the first system-level simulation results and analysis of an RIS\ndeployment in a typical urban city that is served by a fifth-generation\ncellular network. The obtained system-level simulation results unveil that the\nbenefits of RISs vary depending on the operating frequency and the size of the\nsurfaces.

In recent years, machine learning (ML) based detectors, especially\ndeep learning-based ones, have demonstrated impressive capability on clone\ndetection. It seems that this longstanding problem has already been tamed owing\nto the advances in ML techniques. In this work, we would like to challenge the\nrobustness of the recent ML-based clone detectors through code\nsemantic-preserving transformations. We first utilize fifteen simple code\ntransformation operators combined with commonly-used heuristics (i.e., Random\nSearch, Genetic Algorithm, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo) to perform equivalent\nprogram transformation. Furthermore, we propose a deep reinforcement\nlearning-based sequence generation (DRLSG) strategy to effectively guide the\nsearch process of generating clones that could escape from the detection. We\nthen evaluate the ML-based detectors with the pairs of original and generated\nclones. We realize our method in a framework named CloneGen. CloneGen In\nevaluation, we challenge the two state-of-the-art ML-based detectors and four\ntraditional detectors with the code clones after semantic-preserving\ntransformations via the aid of CloneGen. Surprisingly, our experiments show\nthat, despite the notable successes achieved by existing clone detectors, the\nML models inside these detectors still cannot distinguish numerous clones\nproduced by the code transformations in CloneGen. In addition, adversarial\ntraining of ML-based clone detectors using clones generated by CloneGen can\nimprove their robustness and accuracy.

Nevertheless, their image-level self-supervisions lead\nthe learned representation to sub-optimal for dense prediction tasks, such as\nobject detection, instance segmentation, etc. To tackle this issue, several\nrecent self-supervised learning methods have extended image-level single\nembedding to pixel-level dense embeddings.

Our main contribution is a new\nconstant space phase clock allowing to count parallel time $O(n\\log n)$ whp in\nthe adopted model. This clock admits confirmation of slow leader election and\nin turn construction of a line (and a ring) comprising every agent in the\noptimal parallel time $\\Theta(n\\log n)$ and constant space. This improves on\nthe currently best known upper bound $O(n^2).$\nWe also discuss a variant of the new clock in which utilisation of edges is\nreplaced by interaction of agents with a unique leader.

    "abstract": "Formalization of mathematics is the process of digitizing mathematical\nknowledge, which allows for formal proof verification as well as efficient\nsemantic searches. Given the large and ever-increasing gap between the set of\nformalized and unformalized mathematical knowledge, there is a clear need to\nencourage more computer scientists and mathematicians to solve and formalize\nmathematical problems together. With blockchain technology, we are able to\ndecentralize this process, provide time-stamped verification of authorship and\nencourage collaboration through implementation of incentive mechanisms via\nsmart contracts. Currently, the formalization of mathematics is done through\nthe use of proof assistants, which can be used to verify programs and protocols\nas well. Furthermore, with the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI),\nparticularly machine learning, we can apply automated AI reasoning tools in\nthese proof assistants and (at least partially) automate the process of\nsynthesizing proofs. In our paper, we demonstrate a blockchain-based system for\ncollaborative formalization of mathematics and programs incorporating both\nhuman labour as well as automated AI tools.

    "abstract": "Remembering and forgetting mechanisms are two sides of the same coin in a\nhuman learning-memory system. Inspired by human brain memory mechanisms, modern\nmachine learning systems have been working to endow machine with lifelong\nlearning capability through better remembering while pushing the forgetting as\nthe antagonist to overcome. Nevertheless, this idea might only see the half\npicture. Up until very recently, increasing researchers argue that a brain is\nborn to forget, i.e., forgetting is a natural and active process for abstract,\nrich, and flexible representations. This paper presents a learning model by\nactive forgetting mechanism with artificial neural networks. The active\nforgetting mechanism (AFM) is introduced to a neural network via a\n\"plug-and-play\" forgetting layer (P\\&PF), consisting of groups of inhibitory\nneurons with Internal Regulation Strategy (IRS) to adjust the extinction rate\nof themselves via lateral inhibition mechanism and External Regulation Strategy\n(ERS) to adjust the extinction rate of excitatory neurons via inhibition\nmechanism. Experimental studies have shown that the P\\&PF offers surprising\nbenefits: self-adaptive structure, strong generalization, long-term learning\nand memory, and robustness to data and parameter perturbation. This work sheds\nlight on the importance of forgetting in the learning process and offers new\nperspectives to understand the underlying mechanisms of neural networks.",

Examples of\nsuch control parameters are gains of PID controllers, weights of a cost\nfunction for optimal control, filter coefficients, the sliding surface of a\nsliding mode controller, or weights of a neural network. Hence, the proposed\nmethod can be applied to a wide range of controllers. The method uses a Kalman\nfilter that estimates control parameters rather than the system's state, using\ndata of closed-loop system operation. The control parameter calibration is\ndriven by a training objective, which encompasses specifications on the\nperformance of the dynamical system. The calibration method tunes the\nparameters online and robustly, is computationally efficient, has low data\nstorage requirements, and is easy to implement making it appealing for many\nreal-time applications. Simulation results show that the method is able to\nlearn control parameters quickly (approximately 24% average decay factor of\nclosed-loop cost), is able to tune the parameters to compensate for\ndisturbances (approximately 29% improvement on tracking precision), and is\nrobust to noise. Further, a simulation study with the high-fidelity vehicle\nsimulator CarSim shows that the method can calibrate controllers of a complex\ndynamical system online, which indicates its applicability to a real-world\nsystem.",

However in practice, we can easily\naccess data from multiple sources and also observe relationships between them.\nThen it is of great interest to recognize the relationship between multiple\ntext corpora and further utilize this relationship to improve topic modeling.\nIn this work, we focus on a special type of relationship between two text\ncorpora, which we define as the \"lead-lag relationship\". This relationship\ncharacterizes the phenomenon that one text corpus would influence the topics to\nbe discussed in the other text corpus in the future. To discover the lead-lag\nrelationship, we propose a jointly dynamic topic model and also develop an\nembedding extension to address the modeling problem of large-scale text corpus.\nWith the recognized lead-lag relationship, the similarities of the two text\ncorpora can be figured out and the quality of topic learning in both corpora\ncan be improved. We numerically investigate the performance of the jointly\ndynamic topic modeling approach using synthetic data. Finally, we apply the\nproposed model on two text corpora consisting of statistical papers and the\ngraduation theses.

    "abstract": "Although Capsule Networks show great abilities in defining the position\nrelationship between features in deep neural networks for visual recognition\ntasks, they are computationally expensive and not suitable for running on\nmobile devices. The bottleneck is in the computational complexity of the\nDynamic Routing mechanism used between capsules.

This paper proposes a new class of Fully Connected (FC) Layers by\nxnorizing the linear projector outside or inside the Dynamic Routing within the\nCapsFC layer.

    "abstract": "Variational Quantum Algorithms are hybrid classical-quantum algorithms where\nclassical and quantum computation work in tandem to solve computational\nproblems. These algorithms create interesting challenges for the design of\nsuitable programming languages. In this paper we introduce Qimaera, which is a\nset of libraries for the Idris 2 programming language that enable the\nprogrammer to implement (variational) quantum algorithms where the full power\nof the elegant Idris language works in synchrony with quantum programming\nprimitives that we introduce. The two key ingredients of Idris that make this\npossible are (1) dependent types which allow us to implement unitary (i.e.\nreversible and controllable) quantum operations; and (2) linearity which allows\nus to enforce fine-grained control over the execution of quantum operations\nthat ensures compliance with the laws of quantum mechanics. We demonstrate that\nQimaera is suitable for variational quantum programming by providing\nimplementations of the two most prominent variational quantum algorithms --\nQAOA and VQE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of\nthese algorithms that has been achieved in a type-safe framework.",

    "abstract": "Modern applications often consist of different security domains that require\nisolation from each other. While several solutions exist, most of them rely on\nspecialized hardware, hardware extensions, or require less-efficient software\ninstrumentation of the application.\nIn this paper, we propose Domain Page-Table Isolation (DPTI), a novel\nmechanism for hardware-enforced security domains that can be readily used on\ncommodity off-the-shelf CPUs. DPTI uses two novel techniques for dynamic,\ntime-limited changes to the memory isolation at security-critical points,\ncalled memory freezing and stashing. We demonstrate the versatility and\nefficacy of DPTI in two scenarios: First, DPTI freezes or stashes memory to\nsupport faster and more fine-grained syscall filtering than state-of-the-art\nseccomp-bpf. With the provided memory safety guarantees, DPTI can even securely\nsupport deep argument filtering, such as string comparisons. Second, DPTI\nfreezes or stashes memory to efficiently confine potentially untrusted SGX\nenclaves, outperforming existing solutions by 14.6%-22% while providing the\nsame security guarantees. Our results show that DPTI is a viable mechanism to\nisolate domains within applications using only existing mechanisms available on\nmodern CPUs, without relying on special hardware instructions or extensions",

    "abstract": "There are growing concerns that algorithms, which increasingly make or\ninfluence important decisions pertaining to individuals, might produce outcomes\nthat discriminate against protected groups. We study such fairness concerns in\nthe context of a two-sided market, where there are two sets of agents, and each\nagent has preferences over the other set. The goal is producing a matching\nbetween the sets. This setting has been the focus of a rich body of work. The\nseminal work of Gale and Shapley formulated a stability desideratum, and showed\nthat a stable matching always exists and can be found efficiently. We study\nthis question through the lens of metric-based fairness notions (Dwork et al.,\nKim et al.). We formulate appropriate definitions of fairness and stability in\nthe presence of a similarity metric, and ask: does a fair and stable matching\nalways exist? Can such a matching be found in polynomial time? Our\ncontributions are as follows: (1) Composition failures for classical\nalgorithms: We show that composing the Gale-Shapley algorithm with fair\nhospital preferences can produce blatantly unfair outcomes. (2) New algorithms\nfor finding fair and stable matchings: Our main technical contributions are\nefficient new algorithms for finding fair and stable matchings when: (i) the\nhospitals' preferences are fair, and (ii) the fairness metric satisfies a\nstrong \"proto-metric\" condition: the distance between every two doctors is\neither zero or one. In particular, these algorithms also show that, in this\nsetting, fairness and stability are compatible. (3) Barriers for finding fair\nand stable matchings in the general case: We show that if the hospital\npreferences can be unfair, or if the metric fails to satisfy the proto-metric\ncondition, then no algorithm in a natural class can find a fair and stable\nmatching. The natural class includes the classical Gale-Shapley algorithms and\nour new algorithms.",

A threshold is chosen to discriminate between normal and abnormal\nmachines. However, the threshold changes as surrounding conditions vary.

The experiment evaluation is performed on MIMII dataset for\nindustrial machines namely fan, pump, valve and slide rail.

To address this issue,\nrecently, Jiarpakdee et al. proposed to use {two state-of-the-art}\nmodel-agnostic techniques (i.e., LIME and BreakDown) to explain the prediction\nresults of bug prediction models. Their experiments show these tools can\ngenerate promising results and the generated explanations can assist developers\nunderstand the prediction results. However, the fact that LIME and BreakDown\nwere only examined on a single software defect prediction model setting calls\ninto question about their consistency and reliability across software defect\nprediction models with various settings.\nIn this paper, we set out to investigate the consistency and reliability of\nmodel-agnostic technique based explanation generation approaches (i.e., LIME\nand BreakDown) on software defect prediction models with different settings ,\ne.g., different data sampling techniques, different machine learning\nclassifiers, and different prediction scenarios. Specifically, we use both LIME\nand BreakDown to generate explanations for the same instance under software\ndefect prediction models with different settings and then check the consistency\nof the generated explanations for the instance. We reused the same defect data\nfrom Jiarpakdee et al. in our experiments.

Despite the\nwidespread applicability of FG-SBIR in many critical domains (e.g., crime\nactivity tracking), existing approaches still suffer from a low accuracy while\nbeing sensitive to external noises such as unnecessary strokes in the sketch.\nThe retrieval performance will further deteriorate under a more practical\non-the-fly setting, where only a partially complete sketch with only a few\n(noisy) strokes are available to retrieve corresponding images. We propose a\nnovel framework that leverages a uniquely designed deep reinforcement learning\nmodel that performs a dual-level exploration to deal with partial sketch\ntraining and attention region selection. By enforcing the model's attention on\nthe important regions of the original sketches, it remains robust to\nunnecessary stroke noises and improve the retrieval accuracy by a large margin.\nTo sufficiently explore partial sketches and locate the important regions to\nattend, the model performs bootstrapped policy gradient for global exploration\nwhile adjusting a standard deviation term that governs a locator network for\nlocal exploration. The training process is guided by a hybrid loss that\nintegrates a reinforcement loss and a supervised loss. A dynamic ranking reward\nis developed to fit the on-the-fly image retrieval process using partial\nsketches. The extensive experimentation performed on three public datasets\nshows that our proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance on\npartial sketch based image retrieval.",

    "title": "Offline Reinforcement Learning: Fundamental Barriers for Value Function  Approximation",
    "abstract": "We consider the offline reinforcement learning problem, where the aim is to\nlearn a decision making policy from logged data. Offline RL -- particularly\nwhen coupled with (value) function approximation to allow for generalization in\nlarge or continuous state spaces -- is becoming increasingly relevant in\npractice, because it avoids costly and time-consuming online data collection\nand is well suited to safety-critical domains. Existing sample complexity\nguarantees for offline value function approximation methods typically require\nboth (1) distributional assumptions (i.e., good coverage) and (2)\nrepresentational assumptions (i.e., ability to represent some or all $Q$-value\nfunctions) stronger than what is required for supervised learning. However, the\nnecessity of these conditions and the fundamental limits of offline RL are not\nwell understood in spite of decades of research. This led Chen and Jiang (2019)\nto conjecture that concentrability (the most standard notion of coverage) and\nrealizability (the weakest representation condition) alone are not sufficient\nfor sample-efficient offline RL. We resolve this conjecture in the positive by\nproving that in general, even if both concentrability and realizability are\nsatisfied, any algorithm requires sample complexity polynomial in the size of\nthe state space to learn a non-trivial policy.\nOur results show that sample-efficient offline reinforcement learning\nrequires either restrictive coverage conditions or representation conditions\nthat go beyond supervised learning, and highlight a phenomenon called\nover-coverage which serves as a fundamental barrier for offline value function\napproximation methods. A consequence of our results for reinforcement learning\nwith linear function approximation is that the separation between online and\noffline RL can be arbitrarily large, even in constant dimension.",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning (TL) leverages previously obtained knowledge to learn new\ntasks efficiently and has been used to train deep learning (DL) models with\nlimited amount of data. When TL is applied to DL, pretrained (teacher) models\nare fine-tuned to build domain specific (student) models. This fine-tuning\nrelies on the fact that DL model can be decomposed to classifiers and feature\nextractors, and a line of studies showed that the same feature extractors can\nbe used to train classifiers on multiple tasks. Furthermore, recent studies\nproposed multiple algorithms that can fine-tune teacher models' feature\nextractors to train student models more efficiently. We note that regardless of\nthe fine-tuning of feature extractors, the classifiers of student models are\ntrained with final outputs of feature extractors (i.e., the outputs of\npenultimate layers). However, a recent study suggested that feature maps in\nResNets across layers could be functionally equivalent, raising the possibility\nthat feature maps inside the feature extractors can also be used to train\nstudent models' classifiers. Inspired by this study, we tested if feature maps\nin the hidden layers of the teacher models can be used to improve the student\nmodels' accuracy (i.e., TL's efficiency). Specifically, we developed 'adaptive\ntransfer learning (ATL)', which can choose an optimal set of feature maps for\nTL, and tested it in the few-shot learning setting. Our empirical evaluations\nsuggest that ATL can help DL models learn more efficiently, especially when\navailable examples are limited.",

This creates an unfortunate conflict -- either use learning and lose\nout on well-understood geometric navigational components, or do not use it, in\nfavor of extensively hand-tuned geometry-based cost maps. In this work, we\nreject this dichotomy by designing the learning and non-learning-based\ncomponents in a way such that they can be effectively combined in a\nself-supervised manner.

Dialogue sequence labeling is a supervised learning task\nthat estimates labels for each utterance in the target dialogue document, and\nis useful for many applications such as dialogue act estimation. Accurate\nlabeling is often realized by a hierarchically-structured large model\nconsisting of utterance-level and dialogue-level networks that capture the\ncontexts within an utterance and between utterances, respectively. However, due\nto its large model size, such a model cannot be deployed on\nresource-constrained devices. To overcome this difficulty, we focus on\nknowledge distillation which trains a small model by distilling the knowledge\nof a large and high performance teacher model. Our key idea is to distill the\nknowledge while keeping the complex contexts captured by the teacher model. To\nthis end, the proposed method, hierarchical knowledge distillation, trains the\nsmall model by distilling not only the probability distribution of the label\nclassification, but also the knowledge of utterance-level and dialogue-level\ncontexts trained in the teacher model by training the model to mimic the\nteacher model's output in each level.

To address this, we introduce a simple yet effective\ndata augmentation method, Mix/UnMix (MUM), which unmixes feature tiles for the\nmixed image tiles for the SSOD framework. Our proposed method makes mixed input\nimage tiles and reconstructs them in the feature space. Thus, MUM can enjoy the\ninterpolation-regularization effect from non-interpolated pseudo-labels and\nsuccessfully generate a meaningful weak-strong pair. Furthermore, MUM can be\neasily equipped on top of various SSOD methods. Extensive experiments on\nMS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate the superiority of MUM by\nconsistently improving the mAP performance over the baseline in all the tested\nSSOD benchmark protocols.",

Most of the existing methods rely on angular prediction or\npredefined anchor boxes, making these methods highly sensitive to unstable\nangular regression and excessive hyper-parameter setting. To address these\nissues, we replace the angular-based object encoding with an\nanchor-and-angle-free paradigm, and propose a novel detector deploying a center\nand four midpoints for encoding each oriented object, namely MidNet. MidNet\ndesigns a symmetrical deformable convolution customized for enhancing the\nmidpoints of ships, then the center and midpoints for an identical ship are\nadaptively matched by predicting corresponding centripetal shift and matching\nradius. Finally, a concise analytical geometry algorithm is proposed to refine\nthe centers and midpoints step-wisely for building precise oriented bounding\nboxes. On two public ship detection datasets, HRSC2016 and FGSD2021, MidNet\noutperforms the state-of-the-art detectors by achieving APs of 90.52% and\n86.50%.

In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial\nexample defense system called Medical Aegis. To the best of our knowledge,\nMedical Aegis is the first defense in the literature that successfully\naddresses the strong adaptive adversarial example attacks to medical images.\nMedical Aegis boasts two-tier protectors: The first tier of Cushion weakens the\nadversarial manipulation capability of an attack by removing its high-frequency\ncomponents, yet posing a minimal effect on classification performance of the\noriginal image; the second tier of Shield learns a set of per-class DNN models\nto predict the logits of the protected model. Deviation from the Shield's\nprediction indicates adversarial examples.

    "abstract": "Increasing demand for meat products combined with farm labor shortages has\nresulted in a need to develop new real-time solutions to monitor animals\neffectively. Significant progress has been made in continuously locating\nindividual pigs using tracking-by-detection methods. However, these methods\nfail for oblong pens because a single fixed camera does not cover the entire\nfloor at adequate resolution. We address this problem by using multiple\ncameras, placed such that the visual fields of adjacent cameras overlap, and\ntogether they span the entire floor. Avoiding breaks in tracking requires\ninter-camera handover when a pig crosses from one camera's view into that of an\nadjacent camera. We identify the adjacent camera and the shared pig location on\nthe floor at the handover time using inter-view homography. Our experiments\ninvolve two grow-finish pens, housing 16-17 pigs each, and three RGB cameras.\nOur algorithm first detects pigs using a deep learning-based object detection\nmodel (YOLO) and creates their local tracking IDs using a multi-object tracking\nalgorithm (DeepSORT). We then use inter-camera shared locations to match\nmultiple views and generate a global ID for each pig that holds throughout\ntracking. To evaluate our approach, we provide five two-minutes long video\nsequences with fully annotated global identities. We track pigs in a single\ncamera view with a Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and Precision of 65.0% and\n54.3% respectively and achieve a Camera Handover Accuracy of 74.0%.

By producing features that are\nguaranteed to transform covariantly to the group actions on the inputs,\ngroup-equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) achieve significantly\nimproved generalization performance in learning tasks with intrinsic symmetry.\nGeneral theory and practical implementation of G-CNNs have been studied for\nplanar images under either rotation or scaling transformation, but only\nindividually. We present, in this paper, a roto-scale-translation equivariant\nCNN (RST-CNN), that is guaranteed to achieve equivariance jointly over these\nthree groups via coupled group convolutions. Moreover, as symmetry\ntransformations in reality are rarely perfect and typically subject to input\ndeformation, we provide a stability analysis of the equivariance of\nrepresentation to input distortion, which motivates the truncated expansion of\nthe convolutional filters under (pre-fixed) low-frequency spatial modes. The\nresulting model provably achieves deformation-robust RST equivariance, i.e.,\nthe RST symmetry is still \"approximately\" preserved when the transformation is\n\"contaminated\" by a nuisance data deformation, a property that is especially\nimportant for out-of-distribution generalization.

Moreover, their adversarial examples are generated under\nthe white-box setting, which frequently suffers from low success rates when\ntransferred to attack remote black-box models. In this paper, we study 3D point\ncloud attacks from two new and challenging perspectives by proposing a novel\nImperceptible Transfer Attack (ITA): 1) Imperceptibility: we constrain the\nperturbation direction of each point along its normal vector of the\nneighborhood surface, leading to generated examples with similar geometric\nproperties and thus enhancing the imperceptibility. 2) Transferability: we\ndevelop an adversarial transformation model to generate the most harmful\ndistortions and enforce the adversarial examples to resist it, improving their\ntransferability to unknown black-box models. Further, we propose to train more\nrobust black-box 3D models to defend against such ITA attacks by learning more\ndiscriminative point cloud representations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate\nthat our ITA attack is more imperceptible and transferable than\nstate-of-the-arts and validate the superiority of our defense strategy.",

An effective\nbackdoor attack could enforce the model misbehave under certain predefined\nconditions, i.e., triggers, but behave normally otherwise. However, the\ntriggers of existing attacks are directly injected in the pixel space, which\ntend to be detectable by existing defenses and visually identifiable at both\ntraining and inference stages. In this paper, we propose a new backdoor attack\nFTROJAN through trojaning the frequency domain. The key intuition is that\ntriggering perturbations in the frequency domain correspond to small pixel-wise\nperturbations dispersed across the entire image, breaking the underlying\nassumptions of existing defenses and making the poisoning images visually\nindistinguishable from clean ones. We evaluate FTROJAN in several datasets and\ntasks showing that it achieves a high attack success rate without significantly\ndegrading the prediction accuracy on benign inputs. Moreover, the poisoning\nimages are nearly invisible and retain high perceptual quality. We also\nevaluate FTROJAN against state-of-the-art defenses as well as several adaptive\ndefenses that are designed on the frequency domain. The results show that\nFTROJAN can robustly elude or significantly degenerate the performance of these\ndefenses.",

    "abstract": "Sparse model identification enables the discovery of nonlinear dynamical\nsystems purely from data; however, this approach is sensitive to noise,\nespecially in the low-data limit. In this work, we leverage the statistical\napproach of bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to robustify the sparse\nidentification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm. First, an ensemble of\nSINDy models is identified from subsets of limited and noisy data. The\naggregate model statistics are then used to produce inclusion probabilities of\nthe candidate functions, which enables uncertainty quantification and\nprobabilistic forecasts. We apply this ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy) algorithm to\nseveral synthetic and real-world data sets and demonstrate substantial\nimprovements to the accuracy and robustness of model discovery from extremely\nnoisy and limited data. For example, E-SINDy uncovers partial differential\nequations models from data with more than twice as much measurement noise as\nhas been previously reported. Similarly, E-SINDy learns the Lotka Volterra\ndynamics from remarkably limited data of yearly lynx and hare pelts collected\nfrom 1900-1920. E-SINDy is computationally efficient, with similar scaling as\nstandard SINDy. Finally, we show that ensemble statistics from E-SINDy can be\nexploited for active learning and improved model predictive control.",

    "abstract": "The increase in scale of cyber networks and the rise in sophistication of\ncyber-attacks have introduced several challenges in intrusion detection. The\nprimary challenge is the requirement to detect complex multi-stage attacks in\nrealtime by processing the immense amount of traffic produced by present-day\nnetworks. In this paper we present PRISM, a hierarchical intrusion detection\narchitecture that uses a novel attacker behavior model-based sampling technique\nto minimize the realtime traffic processing overhead. PRISM has a unique\nmulti-layered architecture that monitors network traffic distributedly to\nprovide efficiency in processing and modularity in design. PRISM employs a\nHidden Markov Model-based prediction mechanism to identify multi-stage attacks\nand ascertain the attack progression for a proactive response. Furthermore,\nPRISM introduces a stream management procedure that rectifies the issue of\nalert reordering when collected from distributed alert reporting systems. To\nevaluate the performance of PRISM, multiple metrics has been proposed, and\nvarious experiments have been conducted on a multi-stage attack dataset. The\nresults exhibit up to 7.5x improvement in processing overhead as compared to a\nstandard centralized IDS without the loss of prediction accuracy while\ndemonstrating the ability to predict different attack stages promptly.",

However, recent studies show the\ntwo clues might be misaligned in the difficult text (e.g., with rare text\nshapes) and introduce constraints such as character position to alleviate the\nproblem. Despite certain success, a content-free positional embedding hardly\nassociates with meaningful local image regions stably.

MDCDP\nuses positional embedding to query both visual and semantic features following\nthe attention mechanism. It naturally encodes the positional clue, which\ndescribes both visual and semantic distances among characters. We develop a\nnovel architecture named CDistNet that stacks MDCDP several times to guide\nprecise distance modeling. Thus, the visual-semantic alignment is well built\neven various difficulties presented. We apply CDistNet to two augmented\ndatasets and six public benchmarks.

Additionally, both approaches\nare hard to explicitly provide a personalized decision boundary to determine if\nusers are interested in items unseen. To address those issues, we innovatively\nintroduce an auxiliary score $b_u$ for each user to represent the User Interest\nBoundary(UIB) and individually penalize samples that cross the boundary with\npairwise paradigms, i.e., the positive samples whose score is lower than $b_u$\nand the negative samples whose score is higher than $b_u$.

In the first scheme, the energy\nconsumption of SRs is minimized and balanced while guaranteeing that the tasks\nare accomplished under a time constraint. In the second scheme, not only the\nenergy consumption, but also the remaining energies of the SRs are considered\nto enhance the robustness of the system. Through the analysis and numerical\nsimulations, we demonstrate that even though the first policy may guarantee the\nminimization on the total SRs' energy consumption, the function time of MRC\nsystem by the second scheme is longer than that by the first one.",

    "abstract": "Automatic surgical phase recognition plays an important role in\nrobot-assisted surgeries. Existing methods ignored a pivotal problem that\nsurgical phases should be classified by learning segment-level semantics\ninstead of solely relying on frame-wise information. In this paper, we present\na segment-attentive hierarchical consistency network (SAHC) for surgical phase\nrecognition from videos. The key idea is to extract hierarchical high-level\nsemantic-consistent segments and use them to refine the erroneous predictions\ncaused by ambiguous frames. To achieve it, we design a temporal hierarchical\nnetwork to generate hierarchical high-level segments. Then, we introduce a\nhierarchical segment-frame attention (SFA) module to capture relations between\nthe low-level frames and high-level segments. By regularizing the predictions\nof frames and their corresponding segments via a consistency loss, the network\ncan generate semantic-consistent segments and then rectify the misclassified\npredictions caused by ambiguous low-level frames. We validate SAHC on two\npublic surgical video datasets, i.e., the M2CAI16 challenge dataset and the\nCholec80 dataset. Experimental results show that our method outperforms\nprevious state-of-the-arts by a large margin, notably reaches 4.1% improvements\non M2CAI16. Code will be released at GitHub upon acceptance.",

    "abstract": "The robustness and generalization ability of Presentation Attack Detection\n(PAD) methods is critical to ensure the security of Face Recognition Systems\n(FRSs). However, in the real scenario, Presentation Attacks (PAs) are various\nand hard to be collected. Existing PAD methods are highly dependent on the\nlimited training set and cannot generalize well to unknown PAs. Unlike PAD\ntask, other face-related tasks trained by huge amount of real faces (e.g. face\nrecognition and attribute editing) can be effectively adopted into different\napplication scenarios. Inspired by this, we propose to apply taskonomy (task\ntaxonomy) from other face-related tasks to solve face PAD, so as to improve the\ngeneralization ability in detecting PAs. The proposed method, first introduces\ntask specific features from other face-related tasks, then, we design a\nCross-Modal Adapter using a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to re-map such\nfeatures to adapt to PAD task. Finally, face PAD is achieved by using the\nhierarchical features from a CNN-based PA detector and the re-mapped features.\nThe experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve significant\nimprovements in the complicated and hybrid datasets, when compared with the\nstate-of-the-art methods. In particular, when trained using OULU-NPU,\nCASIA-FASD, and Idiap Replay-Attack, we obtain HTER (Half Total Error Rate) of\n5.48% in MSU-MFSD, outperforming the baseline by 7.39%.

Existing models are mainly learned\nin a supervised manner, thus heavily depending on large-scale labeled data\nwhich could be infeasible when labels are prohibitively expensive. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Contrast-Reconstruction Representation Learning\nnetwork (CRRL) that simultaneously captures postures and motion dynamics for\nunsupervised skeleton-based action recognition. It mainly consists of three\nparts: Sequence Reconstructor, Contrastive Motion Learner, and Information\nFuser. The Sequence Reconstructor learns representation from skeleton\ncoordinate sequence via reconstruction, thus the learned representation tends\nto focus on trivial postural coordinates and be hesitant in motion learning. To\nenhance the learning of motions, the Contrastive Motion Learner performs\ncontrastive learning between the representations learned from coordinate\nsequence and additional velocity sequence, respectively. Finally, in the\nInformation Fuser, we explore varied strategies to combine the Sequence\nReconstructor and Contrastive Motion Learner, and propose to capture postures\nand motions simultaneously via a knowledge-distillation based fusion strategy\nthat transfers the motion learning from the Contrastive Motion Learner to the\nSequence Reconstructor. Experimental results on several benchmarks, i.e., NTU\nRGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, CMU mocap, and NW-UCLA, demonstrate the promise of the\nproposed CRRL method by far outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.",

Although recent domain adaptation techniques attempt to\nsolve this problem, the complex interplay between the diverse factors often\nlimits their effectiveness.

Our\nevaluation with four real-world sensing datasets compared against four\nbaselines shows that DAPPER outperforms the baselines by on average 17% in\nestimation accuracy.

Adversarial machine learning is one such research\neffort, employing deceptive inputs to fool models in making wrong predictions.\nTo evaluate attacks and defenses in the field of adversarial machine learning,\nImageNet remains one of the most frequently used datasets. However, a topic\nthat is yet to be investigated is the nature of the classes into which\nadversarial examples are misclassified. In this paper, we perform a detailed\nanalysis of these misclassification classes, leveraging the ImageNet class\nhierarchy and measuring the relative positions of the aforementioned type of\nclasses in the unperturbed origins of the adversarial examples.

    "abstract": "The task of instance segmentation in remote sensing images, aiming at\nperforming per-pixel labeling of objects at instance level, is of great\nimportance for various civil applications. Despite previous successes, most\nexisting instance segmentation methods designed for natural images encounter\nsharp performance degradations when directly applied to top-view remote sensing\nimages. Through careful analysis, we observe that the challenges mainly come\nfrom lack of discriminative object features due to severe scale variations, low\ncontrasts, and clustered distributions. In order to address these problems, a\nnovel context aggregation network (CATNet) is proposed to improve the feature\nextraction process. The proposed model exploits three lightweight plug-and-play\nmodules, namely dense feature pyramid network (DenseFPN), spatial context\npyramid (SCP), and hierarchical region of interest extractor (HRoIE), to\naggregate global visual context at feature, spatial, and instance domains,\nrespectively. DenseFPN is a multi-scale feature propagation module that\nestablishes more flexible information flows by adopting inter-level residual\nconnections, cross-level dense connections, and feature re-weighting strategy.\nLeveraging the attention mechanism, SCP further augments the features by\naggregating global spatial context into local regions. For each instance, HRoIE\nadaptively generates RoI features for different downstream tasks. We carry out\nextensive evaluation of the proposed scheme on the challenging iSAID, DIOR,\nNWPU VHR-10, and HRSID datasets.

    "abstract": "Conventional multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) mainly\nfocused on Gaussian signaling, independent and identically distributed (IID)\nchannels, and a limited number of users. It will be laborious to cope with the\nheterogeneous requirements in next-generation wireless communications, such as\nvarious transmission data, complicated communication scenarios, and massive\nuser access. Therefore, this paper studies a generalized MU-MIMO (GMU-MIMO)\nsystem with more practical constraints, i.e., non-Gaussian signaling, non-IID\nchannel, and massive users and antennas. These generalized assumptions bring\nnew challenges in theory and practice. For example, there is no accurate\ncapacity analysis for GMU-MIMO. In addition, it is unclear how to achieve the\ncapacity optimal performance with practical complexity.\nTo address these challenges, a unified framework is proposed to derive the\nGMU-MIMO capacity and design a capacity optimal transceiver, which jointly\nconsiders encoding, modulation, detection, and decoding. Group asymmetry is\ndeveloped to make a tradeoff between user rate allocation and implementation\ncomplexity. Specifically, the capacity region of group asymmetric GMU-MIMO is\ncharacterized by using the celebrated mutual information and minimum\nmean-square error (MMSE) lemma and the MMSE optimality of orthogonal\napproximate message passing (OAMP)/vector AMP (VAMP). Furthermore, a\ntheoretically optimal multi-user OAMP/VAMP receiver and practical multi-user\nlow-density parity-check (MU-LDPC) codes are proposed to achieve the capacity\nregion of group asymmetric GMU-MIMO. Numerical results verify that the gaps\nbetween theoretical detection thresholds of the proposed framework with\noptimized MU-LDPC codes and QPSK modulation and the sum capacity of GMU-MIMO\nare about 0.2 dB. Moreover, their finite-length performances are about 1~2 dB\naway from the associated sum capacity.",

To\nbridge the gap and facilitate the development of FL for computer vision tasks,\nin this work, we propose a federated learning library and benchmarking\nframework, named FedCV, to evaluate FL on the three most representative\ncomputer vision tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object\ndetection.

    "title": "Algorithmizing the Multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel Lemma",
    "abstract": "The multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel lemma asserts that over a field, a\nlow-degree polynomial cannot vanish with high multiplicity very often on a\nsufficiently large product set. Since its discovery in a work of Dvir,\nKopparty, Saraf and Sudan [SIAM J. Comput., 2013], the lemma has found numerous\napplications in both math and computer science; in particular, in the\ndefinition and properties of multiplicity codes by Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin\n[J. ACM, 2014].\nIn this work, we show how to algorithmize the multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel\nlemma for arbitrary product sets over any field. In other words, we give an\nefficient algorithm for unique decoding of multivariate multiplicity codes from\nhalf their minimum distance on arbitrary product sets over all fields.\nPreviously, such an algorithm was known either when the underlying product set\nhad a nice algebraic structure: for instance, was a subfield (by Kopparty [ToC,\n2015]) or when the underlying field had large (or zero) characteristic, the\nmultiplicity parameter was sufficiently large and the multiplicity code had\ndistance bounded away from $1$ (Bhandari, Harsha, Kumar and Sudan [STOC 2021]).\nIn particular, even unique decoding of bivariate multiplicity codes with\nmultiplicity two from half their minimum distance was not known over arbitrary\nproduct sets over any field.\nOur algorithm builds upon a result of Kim and Kopparty [ToC, 2017] who gave\nan algorithmic version of the Schwartz-Zippel lemma (without multiplicities) or\nequivalently, an efficient algorithm for unique decoding of Reed-Muller codes\nover arbitrary product sets. We introduce a refined notion of distance based on\nthe multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel lemma and design a unique decoding algorithm\nfor this distance measure. On the way, we give an alternate proof of Forney's\nclassical generalized minimum distance decoder that might be of independent\ninterest.",

    "abstract": "Problems with localized nonhomogeneous material properties present well-known\nchallenges for numerical simulations. In particular, such problems may feature\nlarge differences in length scales, causing difficulties with meshing and\npreconditioning. These difficulties are increased if the region of localized\ndynamics changes in time. Overlapping domain decomposition methods, which split\nthe problem at the continuous level, show promise due to their ease of\nimplementation and computational efficiency. Accordingly, the present work aims\nto further develop the mathematical theory of such methods at both the\ncontinuous and discrete levels. For the continuous formulation of the problem,\nwe provide a full convergence analysis. For the discrete problem, we show how\nthe described method may be interpreted as a Gauss-Seidel scheme or as a\nNeumann series approximation, establishing a convergence criterion in terms of\nthe spectral radius of the system. We then provide a spectral scaling argument\nand provide numerical evidence for its justification.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the 3D structure of the drivable surface and surrounding\nenvironment is a crucial task for assisted and autonomous driving. It is\ncommonly solved either by using expensive 3D sensors such as LiDAR or directly\npredicting the depth of points via deep learning. Instead of following existing\nmethodologies, we propose Road Planar Parallax Attention Network (RPANet), a\nnew deep neural network for 3D sensing from monocular image sequences based on\nplanar parallax, which takes full advantage of the commonly seen road plane\ngeometry in driving scenes. RPANet takes a pair of images aligned by the\nhomography of the road plane as input and outputs a $\\gamma$ map for 3D\nreconstruction. Beyond estimating the depth or height, the $\\gamma$ map has a\npotential to construct a two-dimensional transformation between two consecutive\nframes while can be easily derived to depth or height. By warping the\nconsecutive frames using the road plane as a reference, the 3D structure can be\nestimated from the planar parallax and the residual image displacements.\nFurthermore, to make the network better perceive the displacements caused by\nplanar parallax, we introduce a novel cross-attention module. We sample data\nfrom the Waymo Open Dataset and construct data related to planar parallax.\nComprehensive experiments are conducted on the sampled dataset to demonstrate\nthe 3D reconstruction accuracy of our approach in challenging scenarios.",

If a robot accepts task instruction in\nnatural language, first, it has to understand the user's intention by decoding\nthe instruction. However, while executing the task, the robot may face\nunforeseeable circumstances due to the variations in the observed scene and\ntherefore requires further user intervention. In this article, we present a\nsystem called Talk-to-Resolve (TTR) that enables a robot to initiate a coherent\ndialogue exchange with the instructor by observing the scene visually to\nresolve the impasse. Through dialogue, it either finds a cue to move forward in\nthe original plan, an acceptable alternative to the original plan, or\naffirmation to abort the task altogether. To realize the possible stalemate, we\nutilize the dense captions of the observed scene and the given instruction\njointly to compute the robot's next action. We evaluate our system based on a\ndata set of initial instruction and situational scene pairs. Our system can\nidentify the stalemate and resolve them with appropriate dialogue exchange with\n82% accuracy.

    "abstract": "There has been an explosion of interest in designing high-performance\nTransformers. While Transformers have delivered significant performance\nimprovements, training such networks is extremely memory intensive owing to\nstoring all intermediate activations that are needed for gradient computation\nduring backpropagation, especially for long sequences. To this end, we present\nMesa, a memory-saving resource-efficient training framework for Transformers.\nSpecifically, Mesa uses exact activations during forward pass while storing a\nlow-precision version of activations to reduce memory consumption during\ntraining. The low-precision activations are then dequantized during\nback-propagation to compute gradients. Besides, to address the heterogeneous\nactivation distributions in the multi-head self-attention layers, we propose a\nhead-wise activation quantization strategy, which quantizes activations based\non the statistics of each head to minimize the approximation error. To further\nboost training efficiency, we learn quantization parameters by running\nestimates. More importantly, by re-investing the saved memory in employing a\nlarger batch size or scaling up model size, we may further improve the\nperformance under constrained computational resources. Extensive experiments on\nImageNet, CIFAR-100 and ADE20K demonstrate that Mesa can reduce half of the\nmemory footprints during training while achieving comparable or even better\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Presentation attacks are recurrent threats to biometric systems, where\nimpostors attempt to bypass these systems. Humans often use background\ninformation as contextual cues for their visual system. Yet, regarding\nface-based systems, the background is often discarded, since face presentation\nattack detection (PAD) models are mostly trained with face crops. This work\npresents a comparative study of face PAD models (including multi-task learning,\nadversarial training and dynamic frame selection) in two settings: with and\nwithout crops. The results show that the performance is consistently better\nwhen the background is present in the images. The proposed multi-task\nmethodology beats the state-of-the-art results on the ROSE-Youtu dataset by a\nlarge margin with an equal error rate of 0.2%. Furthermore, we analyze the\nmodels' predictions with Grad-CAM++ with the aim to investigate to what extent\nthe models focus on background elements that are known to be useful for human\ninspection. From this analysis we can conclude that the background cues are not\nrelevant across all the attacks. Thus, showing the capability of the model to\nleverage the background information only when necessary.",

    "abstract": "Far beyond learning long-range interactions of natural language, transformers\nare becoming the de-facto standard for many vision tasks with their power and\nscalabilty. Especially with cross-modal tasks between image and text, vector\nquantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are widely used to make a raw RGB\nimage into a sequence of feature vectors. To better leverage the correlation\nbetween image and text, we propose L-Verse, a novel architecture consisting of\nfeature-augmented variational autoencoder (AugVAE) and bidirectional\nauto-regressive transformer (BiART) for text-to-image and image-to-text\ngeneration. Our AugVAE shows the state-of-the-art reconstruction performance on\nImageNet1K validation set, along with the robustness to unseen images in the\nwild. Unlike other models, BiART can distinguish between image (or text) as a\nconditional reference and a generation target. L-Verse can be directly used for\nimage-to-text or text-to-image generation tasks without any finetuning or extra\nobject detection frameworks. In quantitative and qualitative experiments,\nL-Verse shows impressive results against previous methods in both image-to-text\nand text-to-image generation on MS-COCO Captions. We furthermore assess the\nscalability of L-Verse architecture on Conceptual Captions and present the\ninitial results of bidirectional vision-language representation learning on\ngeneral domain.

Generally, pure geometry-based\nalgorithms are not as robust as deep learning in feature-point extraction and\nmatching, but perform well in ego-motion estimation because of their\nwell-established geometric theory. In this work, a novel optical flow network\n(PANet) built on a position-aware mechanism is proposed first.

The key component of the\nproposed system is an improved bundle adjustment module containing multiple\nsampling, initialization of ego-motion, dynamic damping factor adjustment, and\nJacobi matrix weighting. In addition, a novel relative photometric loss\nfunction is advanced to improve the depth estimation accuracy.

The existence of such 'winning\ntickets' has been proven theoretically but at suboptimal sparsity levels.\nContemporary pruning algorithms have furthermore been struggling to identify\nsparse lottery tickets for complex learning tasks.

    "abstract": "The paper extends the formulation of a 2D geometrically exact beam element\nproposed in our previous paper [1] to curved elastic beams. This formulation is\nbased on equilibrium equations in their integrated form, combined with the\nkinematic relations and sectional equations that link the internal forces to\nsectional deformation variables. The resulting first-order differential\nequations are approximated by the finite difference scheme and the boundary\nvalue problem is converted to an initial value problem using the shooting\nmethod. The paper develops the theoretical framework based on the\nNavier-Bernoulli hypothesis but the approach could be extended to\nshear-flexible beams. The initial shape of the beam is captured with high\naccuracy, for certain shapes including the circular one even exactly. Numerical\nprocedures for the evaluation of equivalent nodal forces and of the element\ntangent stiffness are presented in detail. Unlike standard finite element\nformulations, the present approach can increase accuracy by refining the\nintegration scheme on the element level while the number of global degrees of\nfreedom is kept constant. The efficiency and accuracy of the developed scheme\nare documented by five examples that cover circular and parabolic arches and a\nspiral-shaped beam. It is also shown that, for initially curved beams, a cross\neffect in the relations between internal forces and deformation variables\narises, i.e., the bending moment affects axial stretching and the normal force\naffects the curvature.",

    "abstract": "A backdoor deep learning (DL) model behaves normally upon clean inputs but\nmisbehaves upon trigger inputs as the backdoor attacker desires, posing severe\nconsequences to DL model deployments. State-of-the-art defenses are either\nlimited to specific backdoor attacks (source-agnostic attacks) or\nnon-user-friendly in that machine learning (ML) expertise or expensive\ncomputing resources are required. This work observes that all existing backdoor\nattacks have an inevitable intrinsic weakness, non-transferability, that is, a\ntrigger input hijacks a backdoored model but cannot be effective to another\nmodel that has not been implanted with the same backdoor. With this key\nobservation, we propose non-transferability enabled backdoor detection (NTD) to\nidentify trigger inputs for a model-under-test (MUT) during\nrun-time.Specifically, NTD allows a potentially backdoored MUT to predict a\nclass for an input. In the meantime, NTD leverages a feature extractor (FE) to\nextract feature vectors for the input and a group of samples randomly picked\nfrom its predicted class, and then compares similarity between the input and\nthe samples in the FE's latent space. If the similarity is low, the input is an\nadversarial trigger input; otherwise, benign. The FE is a free pre-trained\nmodel privately reserved from open platforms. As the FE and MUT are from\ndifferent sources, the attacker is very unlikely to insert the same backdoor\ninto both of them. Because of non-transferability, a trigger effect that does\nwork on the MUT cannot be transferred to the FE, making NTD effective against\ndifferent types of backdoor attacks. We evaluate NTD on three popular\ncustomized tasks such as face recognition, traffic sign recognition and general\nanimal classification, results of which affirm that NDT has high effectiveness\n(low false acceptance rate) and usability (low false rejection rate) with low\ndetection latency.",

The similarity between graphs of layers identifies the\ncorrespondences between representations of models trained in different datasets\nand initializations. We demonstrate and prove the invariance property of GBS,\nincluding invariance to orthogonal transformation and invariance to isotropic\nscaling, and compare GBS with CKA. GBS shows state-of-the-art performance in\nreflecting the similarity and provides insights on explaining the adversarial\nsample behavior on the hidden layer space.",

    "abstract": "Scripting languages are continuously gaining popularity due to their ease of\nuse and the flourishing software ecosystems that surround them. These languages\noffer crash and memory safety by design, hence developers do not need to\nunderstand and prevent most low-level security issues plaguing languages like\nC. However, scripting languages often allow native extensions, which are a way\nfor custom C/C++ code to be invoked directly from the high-level language.\nWhile this feature promises several benefits such as increased performance or\nthe reuse of legacy code, it can also break the guarantees provided by the\nlanguage, e.g., crash-safety. In this work, we first provide a comparative\nanalysis of the security risks of the existing native extension API in three\npopular scripting languages. Additionally, we discuss a novel methodology for\nstudying vulnerabilities caused by misuse of the native extension API. We then\nperform an in-depth study of npm, an ecosystem which appears to be the most\nexposed to threats introduced by native extensions. We show that\nvulnerabilities in extensions can be exploited in their embedding library by\nproducing a hard crash in 30 npm packages, simply by invoking their API.\nMoreover, we identify five open-source web applications in which such exploits\ncan be deployed remotely. Finally, we provide a set of recommendations for\nlanguage designers, users and for the research community.",

Although these methods have achieved great success, the\nsoftmax-based loss has its limitation from the perspective of open set\nclassification: the multi-classification objective in the training phase does\nnot strictly match the objective of open set classification testing. In this\npaper, we derive a new loss named global boundary CosFace (GB-CosFace). Our\nGB-CosFace introduces an adaptive global boundary to determine whether two face\nsamples belong to the same identity so that the optimization objective is\naligned with the testing process from the perspective of open set\nclassification. Meanwhile, since the loss formulation is derived from the\nsoftmax-based loss, our GB-CosFace retains the excellent properties of the\nsoftmax-based loss, and CosFace is proved to be a special case of the proposed\nloss. We analyze and explain the proposed GB-CosFace geometrically.\nComprehensive experiments on multiple face recognition benchmarks indicate that\nthe proposed GB-CosFace outperforms current state-of-the-art face recognition\nlosses in mainstream face recognition tasks.

Given the recent success of transferring online RL\nalgorithms to the multi-agent setting, one may expect that offline RL\nalgorithms will also transfer to multi-agent settings directly. Surprisingly,\nwhen conservatism-based algorithms are applied to the multi-agent setting, the\nperformance degrades significantly with an increasing number of agents. Towards\nmitigating the degradation, we identify that a key issue that the landscape of\nthe value function can be non-concave and policy gradient improvements are\nprone to local optima. Multiple agents exacerbate the problem since the\nsuboptimal policy by any agent could lead to uncoordinated global failure.\nFollowing this intuition, we propose a simple yet effective method, Offline\nMulti-Agent RL with Actor Rectification (OMAR), to tackle this critical\nchallenge via an effective combination of first-order policy gradient and\nzeroth-order optimization methods for the actor to better optimize the\nconservative value function.

    "abstract": "Existing Class Incremental Learning (CIL) methods are based on a supervised\nclassification framework sensitive to data labels. When updating them based on\nthe new class data, they suffer from catastrophic forgetting: the model cannot\ndiscern old class data clearly from the new. In this paper, we explore the\nperformance of Self-Supervised representation learning in Class Incremental\nLearning (SSCIL) for the first time, which discards data labels and the model's\nclassifiers. To comprehensively discuss the difference in performance between\nsupervised and self-supervised methods in CIL, we set up three different class\nincremental schemes: Random Class Scheme, Semantic Class Scheme, and Cluster\nScheme, to simulate various class incremental learning scenarios. Besides, we\npropose Linear Evaluation Protocol (LEP) and Generalization Evaluation Protocol\n(GEP) to metric the model's representation classification ability and\ngeneralization in CIL. Our experiments (on ImageNet-100 and ImageNet) show that\nSSCIL has better anti-forgetting ability and robustness than supervised\nstrategies in CIL. To understand what alleviates the catastrophic forgetting in\nSSCIL, we study the major components of SSCIL and conclude that (1) the\ncomposition of different data augmentation improves the quality of the model's\nrepresentation and the \\textit{Grayscale} operation reduces the system noise of\ndata augmentation in SSCIL. (2) the projector, like a buffer, reduces\nunnecessary parameter updates of the model in SSCIL and increases the\nrobustness of the model. Although the performance of SSCIL is significantly\nhigher than supervised methods in CIL, there is still an apparent gap with\njoint learning. Our exploration gives a baseline of self-supervised class\nincremental learning on large-scale datasets and contributes some forward\nstrategies for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting in CIL.",

A\nmajor challenge for CL systems is catastrophic forgetting, where earlier tasks\nare forgotten while learning a new task. To address this, replay-based CL\napproaches maintain and repeatedly retrain on a small buffer of data selected\nacross encountered tasks. We propose Gradient Coreset Replay (GCR), a novel\nstrategy for replay buffer selection and update using a carefully designed\noptimization criterion. Specifically, we select and maintain a \"coreset\" that\nclosely approximates the gradient of all the data seen so far with respect to\ncurrent model parameters, and discuss key strategies needed for its effective\napplication to the continual learning setting. We show significant gains (2%-4%\nabsolute) over the state-of-the-art in the well-studied offline continual\nlearning setting. Our findings also effectively transfer to online / streaming\nCL settings, showing upto 5% gains over existing approaches. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the value of supervised contrastive loss for continual learning,\nwhich yields a cumulative gain of up to 5% accuracy when combined with our\nsubset selection strategy.",

    "abstract": "In computational reinforcement learning, a growing body of work seeks to\nexpress an agent's model of the world through predictions about future\nsensations. In this manuscript we focus on predictions expressed as General\nValue Functions: temporally extended estimates of the accumulation of a future\nsignal. One challenge is determining from the infinitely many predictions that\nthe agent could possibly make which might support decision-making. In this\nwork, we contribute a meta-gradient descent method by which an agent can\ndirectly specify what predictions it learns, independent of designer\ninstruction. To that end, we introduce a partially observable domain suited to\nthis investigation. We then demonstrate that through interaction with the\nenvironment an agent can independently select predictions that resolve the\npartial-observability, resulting in performance similar to expertly chosen\nvalue functions. By learning, rather than manually specifying these\npredictions, we enable the agent to identify useful predictions in a\nself-supervised manner, taking a step towards truly autonomous systems.",

However, NeRF and its variants require a lengthy training time\nranging from hours to days for a single scene. In contrast, our approach\nachieves NeRF-comparable quality and converges rapidly from scratch in less\nthan 15 minutes with a single GPU. We adopt a representation consisting of a\ndensity voxel grid for scene geometry and a feature voxel grid with a shallow\nnetwork for complex view-dependent appearance. Modeling with explicit and\ndiscretized volume representations is not new, but we propose two simple yet\nnon-trivial techniques that contribute to fast convergence speed and\nhigh-quality output. First, we introduce the post-activation interpolation on\nvoxel density, which is capable of producing sharp surfaces in lower grid\nresolution. Second, direct voxel density optimization is prone to suboptimal\ngeometry solutions, so we robustify the optimization process by imposing\nseveral priors. Finally, evaluation on five inward-facing benchmarks shows that\nour method matches, if not surpasses, NeRF's quality, yet it only takes about\n15 minutes to train from scratch for a new scene.",

We represent the gradient of the value function with respect to a\ngiven parameterized stochastic policy as the expected integration of an\nauxiliary running reward function that can be evaluated using samples and the\ncurrent value function. This effectively turns PG into a policy evaluation (PE)\nproblem, enabling us to apply the martingale approach recently developed by Jia\nand Zhou (2021) for PE to solve our PG problem. Based on this analysis, we\npropose two types of the actor-critic algorithms for RL, where we learn and\nupdate value functions and policies simultaneously and alternatingly. The first\ntype is based directly on the aforementioned representation which involves\nfuture trajectories and hence is offline. The second type, designed for online\nlearning, employs the first-order condition of the policy gradient and turns it\ninto martingale orthogonality conditions. These conditions are then\nincorporated using stochastic approximation when updating policies. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the algorithms by simulations in two concrete examples.",

Traditional methods of transient stability\nassessment, such as time domain simulation approach and direct methods, are\nappropriate for offline studies and thus, cannot be applied for online\ntransient stability prediction, which is a major requirement in modern power\nsystems. This motivated the requirement to apply an artificial\nintelligence-based approach. In this regard, supervised machine learning is\nbeneficial for predicting transient stability status, in the presence of\nuncertainties. Therefore, this paper examines the application of a binary\nsupport vector machine-based supervised machine learning, for predicting the\ntransient stability status of a power system, considering uncertainties of\nvarious factors, such as load, faulted line, fault type, fault location and\nfault clearing time.

    "abstract": "Product quality assessment in the petroleum processing industry can be\ndifficult and time-consuming, e.g. due to a manual collection of liquid samples\nfrom the plant and subsequent chemical laboratory analysis of the samples. The\nproduct quality is an important property that informs whether the products of\nthe process are within the specifications. In particular, the delays caused by\nsample processing (collection, laboratory measurements, results analysis,\nreporting) can lead to detrimental economic effects. One of the strategies to\ndeal with this problem is soft sensors. Soft sensors are a collection of models\nthat can be used to predict and forecast some infrequently measured properties\n(such as laboratory measurements of petroleum products) based on more frequent\nmeasurements of quantities like temperature, pressure and flow rate provided by\nphysical sensors. Soft sensors short-cut the pathway to obtain relevant\ninformation about the product quality, often providing measurements as\nfrequently as every minute. One of the applications of soft sensors is for the\nreal-time optimization of a chemical process by a targeted adaptation of\noperating parameters. Models used for soft sensors can have various forms,\nhowever, among the most common are those based on artificial neural networks\n(ANNs). While soft sensors can deal with some of the issues in the refinery\nprocesses, their development and deployment can pose other challenges that are\naddressed in this paper. Firstly, it is important to enhance the quality of\nboth sets of data (laboratory measurements and physical sensors) in a data\npre-processing stage (as described in Methodology section).

Using a list of invalid\ncited DOIs gathered by OpenCitations while processing the OpenCitations Index\nof Crossref open DOI-to-DOI citations (COCI) in the past two years, we\nretrieved the citations in the January 2021 Crossref dump to such invalid DOIs.\nWe processed such citations by keeping track of their validity and the\npublishers responsible for uploading the related citation data in Crossref.\nFinally, we identified patterns of factual errors in the invalid DOIs and the\nregular expressions needed to catch and correct them.

We extended the taxonomy of DOI name errors proposed in past studies\nand defined more elaborated regular expressions that can clean a higher amount\nof mistakes in invalid DOIs than prior approaches.

    "abstract": "Fake news is fabricated information that is presented as genuine, with\nintention to deceive the reader. Recently, the magnitude of people relying on\nsocial media for news consumption has increased significantly. Owing to this\nrapid increase, the adverse effects of misinformation affect a wider audience.\nOn account of the increased vulnerability of people to such deceptive fake\nnews, a reliable technique to detect misinformation at its early stages is\nimperative. Hence, the authors propose a novel graph-based framework SOcial\ngraph with Multi-head attention and Publisher information and news Statistics\nNetwork (SOMPS-Net) comprising of two components - Social Interaction Graph\n(SIG) and Publisher and News Statistics (PNS). The posited model is\nexperimented on the HealthStory dataset and generalizes across diverse medical\ntopics including Cancer, Alzheimer's, Obstetrics, and Nutrition. SOMPS-Net\nsignificantly outperformed other state-of-the-art graph-based models\nexperimented on HealthStory by 17.1%. Further, experiments on early detection\ndemonstrated that SOMPS-Net predicted fake news articles with 79% certainty\nwithin just 8 hours of its broadcast. Thus the contributions of this work lay\ndown the foundation for capturing fake health news across multiple medical\ntopics at its early stages.",

    "abstract": "Active inference is a state-of-the-art framework for modelling the brain that\nexplains a wide range of mechanisms such as habit formation, dopaminergic\ndischarge and curiosity. However, recent implementations suffer from an\nexponential (space and time) complexity class when computing the prior over all\nthe possible policies up to the time horizon. Fountas et al. (2020) used Monte\nCarlo tree search to address this problem, leading to very good results in two\ndifferent tasks. Additionally, Champion et al. (2021a) proposed a tree search\napproach based on structure learning. This was enabled by the development of a\nvariational message passing approach to active inference (Champion et al.,\n2021b), which enables compositional construction of Bayesian networks for\nactive inference. However, this message passing tree search approach, which we\ncall branching-time active inference (BTAI), has never been tested empirically.\nIn this paper, we present an experimental study of the approach (Champion et\nal., 2021a) in the context of a maze solving agent. In this context, we show\nthat both improved prior preferences and deeper search help mitigate the\nvulnerability to local minima. Then, we compare BTAI to standard active\ninference (AI) on a graph navigation task. We show that for small graphs, both\nBTAI and AI successfully solve the task. For larger graphs, AI exhibits an\nexponential (space) complexity class, making the approach intractable. However,\nBTAI explores the space of policies more efficiently, successfully scaling to\nlarger graphs.",

Many models on user - search\nengine interaction, which in the literature are known as click models, come in\nthe form of Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Although many authors have used the\nresemblance between the different click models to derive estimation procedures\nfor these models, in particular in the form of expectation maximization (EM),\nstill this commonly requires considerable work, in particular when it comes to\nderiving the E-step. What we propose in this paper, is that this derivation is\ncommonly unnecessary: many existing click models can in fact, under certain\nassumptions, be optimized as they were Input-Output Hidden Markov Models\n(IO-HMMs), for which the forward-backward equations immediately provide this\nE-step. To arrive at that conclusion, we will present the Generalized Cascade\nModel (GCM) and show how this model can be estimated using the IO-HMM EM\nframework, and provide two examples of how existing click models can be mapped\nto GCM.

Manufacturers have been hastily deploying charging\nstations to meet the charging requirements of the EVs on the road. This rapid\ndeployment has contributed to the EV ecosystem's lack of proper security\nmeasures, raising multiple questions related to the power grid security and\nvulnerability. In this paper, we offer a complete examination of the EV\necosystem from the vulnerability to the attacks and finally the solutions. We\nstart by examining the existing vulnerabilities in the EV ecosystem that can be\nexploited to control the EV charging and launch attacks against the power grid.\nWe then discuss the non-linear nature of the EV charging load and simulate\nmultiple attacks that can be launched against the power grid using these EVs.\nEV loads have high reactive power demand which can have a larger impact on the\ngrid compared to residential loads. We perform simulations on two power grids\nand demonstrate that while the grid can recover after a 48 MW attack utilizing\ntraditional residential loads, a smaller 30 MW EV load attack can completely\ndestabilize the system.

Critically, the encoder and\ndecoder are shared among all tasks. Through a dynamic expansion of special\ntokens, we specialize each forward of our decoder network on a task\ndistribution. Our strategy scales to a large number of tasks while having\nnegligible memory and time overheads due to strict control of the parameters\nexpansion. Moreover, this efficient strategy doesn't need any hyperparameter\ntuning to control the network's expansion. Our model reaches excellent results\non CIFAR100 and state-of-the-art performances on the large-scale ImageNet100\nand ImageNet1000 while having less parameters than concurrent dynamic\nframeworks.",

    "abstract": "Discrepancy measures between probability distributions are at the core of\nstatistical inference and machine learning. In many applications, distributions\nof interest are supported on different spaces, and yet a meaningful\ncorrespondence between data points is desired. Motivated to explicitly encode\nconsistent bidirectional maps into the discrepancy measure, this work proposes\na novel unbalanced Monge optimal transport formulation for matching, up to\nisometries, distributions on different spaces. Our formulation arises as a\nprincipled relaxation of the Gromov-Haussdroff distance between metric spaces,\nand employs two cycle-consistent maps that push forward each distribution onto\nthe other. We study structural properties of the proposed discrepancy and, in\nparticular, show that it captures the popular cycle-consistent generative\nadversarial network (GAN) framework as a special case, thereby providing the\ntheory to explain it. Motivated by computational efficiency, we then kernelize\nthe discrepancy and restrict the mappings to parametric function classes. The\nresulting kernelized version is coined the generalized maximum mean discrepancy\n(GMMD). Convergence rates for empirical estimation of GMMD are studied and\nexperiments to support our theory are provided.",

Federated learning is a distributed\nlearning framework that enables multi-institutional collaborations on\ndecentralized data with improved protection for each collaborator's data\nprivacy.

Proxy models allow efficient information exchange among participants\nusing the PushSum method without the need of a centralized server. The proposed\nmethod eliminates a significant limitation of canonical federated learning by\nallowing model heterogeneity; each participant can have a private model with\nany architecture. Furthermore, our protocol for communication by proxy leads to\nstronger privacy guarantees using differential privacy analysis. Experiments on\npopular image datasets, and a pan-cancer diagnostic problem using over 30,000\nhigh-quality gigapixel histology whole slide images, show that ProxyFL can\noutperform existing alternatives with much less communication overhead and\nstronger privacy.",

In an empirical study, we show that the CRU can\nbetter interpolate irregular time series than neural ordinary differential\nequation (neural ODE)-based models.

In this paper, we devise\na dynamic network architecture for continual learning based on a novel\nforgetting-free neural block (FFNB).

However, the\ntransferability of adversarial examples on segmentation models has not been\nsystematically studied. In this work, we intensively study this topic. First,\nwe explore the overfitting phenomenon of adversarial examples on classification\nand segmentation models. In contrast to the observation made on classification\nmodels that the transferability is limited by overfitting to the source model,\nwe find that the adversarial examples on segmentations do not always overfit\nthe source models. Even when no overfitting is presented, the transferability\nof adversarial examples is limited. We attribute the limitation to the\narchitectural traits of segmentation models, i.e., multi-scale object\nrecognition. Then, we propose a simple and effective method, dubbed dynamic\nscaling, to overcome the limitation. The high transferability achieved by our\nmethod shows that, in contrast to the observations in previous work,\nadversarial examples on a segmentation model can be easy to transfer to other\nsegmentation models. Our analysis and proposals are supported by extensive\nexperiments.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have shown great potential in computer vision tasks. A common\nbelief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their\ncompetence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in\ntransformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still\nperform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general\narchitecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module,\nis more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately\nreplace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple\nspatial pooling operator to conduct only the most basic token mixing.\nSurprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves\ncompetitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on\nImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1% top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned\nvision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy\nwith 35%/52% fewer parameters and 48%/60% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of\nPoolFormer verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of\n\"MetaFormer\", a general architecture abstracted from transformers without\nspecifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that\nMetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent\ntransformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more\nfuture research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the\ntoken mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a\nstarting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design. Code is available\nat https://github.com/sail-sg/poolformer",

We\nsought to evaluate whether trends in internet searches related to COVID-19\nvaccination - as reflected by Google's Vaccine Search Insights (VSI) index -\ncould be used as a marker of population-level interest in receiving a\nvaccination. We found that between January and August of 2021: 1) Google's\nweekly VSI index was associated with the number of new vaccinations\nadministered in the subsequent three weeks, and 2) the average VSI index in\nearlier months was strongly correlated (up to r = 0.89) with vaccination rates\nmany months later.

    "abstract": "What constitutes an object? This has been a long-standing question in\ncomputer vision. Towards this goal, numerous learning-free and learning-based\napproaches have been developed to score objectness. However, they generally do\nnot scale well across new domains and for unseen objects. In this paper, we\nadvocate that existing methods lack a top-down supervision signal governed by\nhuman-understandable semantics. To bridge this gap, we explore recent\nMulti-modal Vision Transformers (MViT) that have been trained with aligned\nimage-text pairs. Our extensive experiments across various domains and novel\nobjects show the state-of-the-art performance of MViTs to localize generic\nobjects in images. Based on these findings, we develop an efficient and\nflexible MViT architecture using multi-scale feature processing and deformable\nself-attention that can adaptively generate proposals given a specific language\nquery. We show the significance of MViT proposals in a diverse range of\napplications including open-world object detection, salient and camouflage\nobject detection, supervised and self-supervised detection tasks. Further,\nMViTs offer enhanced interactability with intelligible text queries. Code:\nhttps://git.io/J1HPY.",

    "abstract": "Automated visual understanding of our diverse and open world demands computer\nvision models to generalize well with minimal customization for specific tasks,\nsimilar to human vision. Computer vision foundation models, which are trained\non diverse, large-scale dataset and can be adapted to a wide range of\ndownstream tasks, are critical for this mission to solve real-world computer\nvision applications. While existing vision foundation models such as CLIP,\nALIGN, and Wu Dao 2.0 focus mainly on mapping images and textual\nrepresentations to a cross-modal shared representation, we introduce a new\ncomputer vision foundation model, Florence, to expand the representations from\ncoarse (scene) to fine (object), from static (images) to dynamic (videos), and\nfrom RGB to multiple modalities (caption, depth). By incorporating universal\nvisual-language representations from Web-scale image-text data, our Florence\nmodel can be easily adapted for various computer vision tasks, such as\nclassification, retrieval, object detection, VQA, image caption, video\nretrieval and action recognition. Moreover, Florence demonstrates outstanding\nperformance in many types of transfer learning: fully sampled fine-tuning,\nlinear probing, few-shot transfer and zero-shot transfer for novel images and\nobjects. All of these properties are critical for our vision foundation model\nto serve general purpose vision tasks. Florence achieves new state-of-the-art\nresults in majority of 44 representative benchmarks, e.g., ImageNet-1K\nzero-shot classification with top-1 accuracy of 83.74 and the top-5 accuracy of\n97.18, 62.4 mAP on COCO fine tuning, 80.36 on VQA, and 87.8 on Kinetics-600.",

    "abstract": "For human action understanding, a popular research direction is to analyze\nshort video clips with unambiguous semantic content, such as jumping and\ndrinking. However, methods for understanding short semantic actions cannot be\ndirectly translated to long human dynamics such as dancing, where it becomes\nchallenging even to label the human movements semantically. Meanwhile, the\nnatural language processing (NLP) community has made progress in solving a\nsimilar challenge of annotation scarcity by large-scale pre-training, which\nimproves several downstream tasks with one model. In this work, we study how to\nsegment and cluster videos into recurring temporal patterns in a\nself-supervised way, namely acton discovery, the main roadblock towards video\ntokenization. We propose a two-stage framework that first obtains a frame-wise\nrepresentation by contrasting two augmented views of video frames conditioned\non their temporal context. The frame-wise representations across a collection\nof videos are then clustered by K-means. Actons are then automatically\nextracted by forming a continuous motion sequence from frames within the same\ncluster. We evaluate the frame-wise representation learning step by Kendall's\nTau and the lexicon building step by normalized mutual information and language\nentropy. We also study three applications of this tokenization: genre\nclassification, action segmentation, and action composition. On the AIST++ and\nPKU-MMD datasets, actons bring significant performance improvements compared to\nseveral baselines.",

In this paper, we focus on hyperparameter\nestimation for the Gaussian process (GP) and take a step forward towards\nbreaking the barrier by proving minibatch SGD converges to a critical point of\nthe full log-likelihood loss function, and recovers model hyperparameters with\nrate $O(\\frac{1}{K})$ for $K$ iterations, up to a statistical error term\ndepending on the minibatch size.

    "abstract": "The Kalman filter is an algorithm for the estimation of hidden variables in\ndynamical systems under linear Gauss-Markov assumptions with widespread\napplications across different fields. Recently, its Bayesian interpretation has\nreceived a growing amount of attention especially in neuroscience, robotics and\nmachine learning. In neuroscience, in particular, models of perception and\ncontrol under the banners of predictive coding, optimal feedback control,\nactive inference and more generally the so-called Bayesian brain hypothesis,\nhave all heavily relied on ideas behind the Kalman filter. Active inference, an\nalgorithmic theory based on the free energy principle, specifically builds on\napproximate Bayesian inference methods proposing a variational account of\nneural computation and behaviour in terms of gradients of variational free\nenergy. Using this ambitious framework, several works have discussed different\npossible relations between free energy minimisation and standard Kalman\nfilters. With a few exceptions, however, such relations point at a mere\nqualitative resemblance or are built on a set of very diverse comparisons based\non purported differences between free energy minimisation and Kalman filtering.\nIn this work, we present a straightforward derivation of Kalman filters\nconsistent with active inference via a variational treatment of free energy\nminimisation in terms of gradient descent. The approach considered here offers\na more direct link between models of neural dynamics as gradient descent and\nstandard accounts of perception and decision making based on probabilistic\ninference, further bridging the gap between hypotheses about neural\nimplementation and computational principles in brain and behavioural sciences.",

It also\nmakes the interpretation of observations of lines formed in the chromosphere\nand transition region a slow and computationally costly process, which limits\nthe inference of the physical properties on rather small fields of view. Having\naccess to a fast way of computing the deviation from the LTE regime through the\ndeparture coefficients could largely alleviate this problem. Aims: We propose\nto build and train a graph network that quickly predicts the atomic level\npopulations without solving the non-LTE problem. Methods: We find an optimal\narchitecture for the graph network for predicting the departure coefficients of\nthe levels of an atom from the physical conditions of a model atmosphere. A\nsuitable dataset with a representative sample of potential model atmospheres is\nused for training. This dataset has been computed using existing non-LTE\nsynthesis codes. Results: The graph network has been integrated into existing\nsynthesis and inversion codes for the particular case of \\caii. We demonstrate\norders of magnitude gain in computing speed. We analyze the generalization\ncapabilities of the graph network and demonstrate that it produces good\npredicted departure coefficients for unseen models. We implement this approach\nin \\hazel\\ and show how the inversions nicely compare with those obtained with\nstandard non-LTE inversion codes.

    "abstract": "This paper develops a framework that can perform denoising, dereverberation,\nand source separation accurately by using a relatively small number of\nmicrophones. It has been empirically confirmed that Independent Vector Analysis\n(IVA) can blindly separate $N$ sources from their sound mixture even with\ndiffuse noise when a sufficiently large number ($=M$) of microphones are\navailable (i.e., $M\\gg N)$. However, the estimation accuracy seriously degrades\nas the number of microphones, or more specifically $M-N$ $(\\ge 0)$, decreases.\nTo overcome this limitation of IVA, we propose switching IVA (swIVA) in this\npaper. With swIVA, time frames of an observed signal with time-varying\ncharacteristics are clustered into several groups, each of which can be well\nhandled by IVA using a small number of microphones, and thus accurate\nestimation can be achieved by applying {\\IVA} individually to each of the\ngroups. Conventionally, a switching mechanism was introduced into a beamformer;\nhowever, no blind source separation algorithms with a switching mechanism have\nbeen successfully developed until this paper. In order to incorporate\ndereverberation capability, this paper further extends swIVA to blind\nConvolutional beamforming algorithm (swCIVA). It integrates swIVA and switching\nWeighted Prediction Error-based dereverberation (swWPE) in a jointly optimal\nway. We show that both swIVA and swIVAconv can be optimized effectively based\non blind signal processing, and that their performance can be further improved\nusing a spatial guide for the initialization. Experiments show that the both\nproposed methods largely outperform conventional IVA and its Convolutional\nbeamforming extension (CIVA) in terms of objective signal quality and automatic\nspeech recognition scores when using a relatively small number of microphones.",

    "abstract": "Medical image data are usually imbalanced across different classes. One-class\nclassification has attracted increasing attention to address the data imbalance\nproblem by distinguishing the samples of the minority class from the majority\nclass.

These methods mainly focus on capturing either compact or descriptive\nfeatures, where the information of the samples of a given one class is not\nsufficiently utilized. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based\nmethod to learn compact features by adding constraints on the bottleneck\nfeatures, and to preserve descriptive features by training an autoencoder at\nthe same time. Through jointly optimizing the constraining loss and the\nautoencoder's reconstruction loss, our method can learn more relevant features\nassociated with the given class, making the majority and minority samples more\ndistinguishable.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) based\nencoder-decoder techniques have advanced the performance of automated medical\nimage segmentation systems. Several such CNN-based methodologies utilize\ntechniques such as spatial- and channel-wise attention to enhance performance.\nAnother technique that has drawn attention in recent years is residual dense\nblocks (RDBs). The successive convolutional layers in densely connected blocks\nare capable of extracting diverse features with varied receptive fields and\nthus, enhancing performance.

We develop progressive\nalternating attention dense (PAAD) blocks, which construct a guiding attention\nmap (GAM) after every convolutional layer in the dense blocks using features\nfrom all scales. The GAM allows the following layers in the dense blocks to\nfocus on the spatial locations relevant to the target region. Every alternate\nPAAD block inverts the GAM to generate a reverse attention map which guides\nensuing layers to extract boundary and edge-related information, refining the\nsegmentation process.

Though new GNN variants continue to improve performance, their\nmodifications share a common theme of alleviating problems intrinsic to their\nfundamental graph-to-graph nature. In this work, we examine these limitations\nand propose a new molecular representation that bypasses the need for GNNs\nentirely, dubbed CubeMol.

    "abstract": "The Gittins policy is a highly general scheduling policy that minimizes a\nwide variety of mean holding cost metrics in the M/G/1 queue. Perhaps most\nfamously, Gittins minimizes mean response time in the M/G/1 when jobs' service\ntimes are unknown to the scheduler. Gittins also minimizes weighted versions of\nmean response time. For example, the well-known \"$c\\mu$ rule\", which minimizes\nclass-weighted mean response time in the multiclass M/M/1, is a special case of\nGittins.\nHowever, despite the extensive literature on Gittins in the M/G/1, it\ncontains no fully general proof of Gittins's optimality. This is because\nGittins was originally developed for the multi-armed bandit problem.\nTranslating arguments from the multi-armed bandit to the M/G/1 is technically\ndemanding, so it has only been done rigorously in some special cases. The\nextent of Gittins's optimality in the M/G/1 is thus not entirely clear.\nIn this work we provide the first fully general proof of Gittins's optimality\nin the M/G/1. The optimality result we obtain is even more general than was\npreviously known. For example, we show that Gittins minimizes mean slowdown in\nthe M/G/1 with unknown or partially known service times, and we show that\nGittins's optimality holds under batch arrivals. Our proof uses a novel\napproach that works directly with the M/G/1, avoiding the difficulties of\ntranslating from the multi-armed bandit problem.",

Iterative models are proposed to alleviate the appeared\nartifacts in sparse-view CT images, but the computation cost is too expensive.\nThen deep-learning-based methods have gained prevalence due to the excellent\nperformances and lower computation. However, these methods ignore the mismatch\nbetween the CNN's \\textbf{local} feature extraction capability and the\nsinogram's \\textbf{global} characteristics.

Existing SISR works mainly operate in the spatial domain by\nminimizing the mean squared reconstruction error. Despite the high peak\nsignal-to-noise ratios(PSNR) results, it is difficult to determine whether the\nmodel correctly adds desired high-frequency details. Some residual-based\nstructures are proposed to guide the model to focus on high-frequency features\nimplicitly. However, how to verify the fidelity of those artificial details\nremains a problem since the interpretation from spatial-domain metrics is\nlimited. In this paper, we propose FreqNet, an intuitive pipeline from the\nfrequency domain perspective, to solve this problem. Inspired by existing\nfrequency-domain works, we convert images into discrete cosine transform (DCT)\nblocks, then reform them to obtain the DCT feature maps, which serve as the\ninput and target of our model. A specialized pipeline is designed, and we\nfurther propose a frequency loss function to fit the nature of our\nfrequency-domain task. Our SISR method in the frequency domain can learn the\nhigh-frequency information explicitly, provide fidelity and good perceptual\nquality for the SR images.

The results (including\ncomparison to the SPAIN and Autoregressive methods) are evaluated with four\ndifferent metrics. The observations from the results show that the proposed\nsolution is effective and can enhance the reconstruction of audio signals\nperformed by the side information (noisy-latent representation) steganography\nprovides. This work may trigger interest in the optimization of this approach\nand/or in transferring it to different domains (i.e., image reconstruction).",

    "abstract": "Deep learning algorithms that rely on extensive training data are\nrevolutionizing image recovery from ill-posed measurements. Training data is\nscarce in many imaging applications, including ultra-high-resolution imaging.\nThe deep image prior (DIP) algorithm was introduced for single-shot image\nrecovery, completely eliminating the need for training data. A challenge with\nthis scheme is the need for early stopping to minimize the overfitting of the\nCNN parameters to the noise in the measurements. We introduce a generalized\nStein's unbiased risk estimate (GSURE) loss metric to minimize the overfitting.\nOur experiments show that the SURE-DIP approach minimizes the overfitting\nissues, thus offering significantly improved performance over classical DIP\nschemes. We also use the SURE-DIP approach with model-based unrolling\narchitectures, which offers improved performance over direct inversion schemes.",

    "abstract": "Landauer's erasure principle puts a fundamental constraint on the amount of\nwork required to erase information using thermal reservoirs. Recently this\nbound was improved to include corrections for finite-sized thermal reservoirs.\nIn conventional information-erasure schemes, conservation of energy plays a key\nrole with the cost of erasure. However, it has been shown that erasure can be\nachieved through the manipulation of spin angular momentum rather than energy,\nusing a reservoir composed of energy-degenerate spin particles under the\nconstraint of the conservation of spin angular momentum, in the limit of an\n\\emph{infinite} number of particles. In this case the erasure cost is in terms\nof dissipation of spin angular momentum. Here we analyze the erasure of memory\nusing a \\emph{finite-sized} spin reservoir. We compute the erasure cost to\ncompare it with its infinite counterpart and determine what size of finite\nreservoir gives similar erasure cost statistics using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence as the measure of difference. Our findings show that erasure with\nfinite-sized reservoirs results in the erasure of less information compared to\nthe infinite reservoir counterpart when compared on this basis. In addition we\ndiscuss the cost of resetting the state of the ancillary spin particles used in\nthe erasure process, and we investigate the degradation in erasure performance\nwhen a finite reservoir is repeatedly reused to erase a sequence of memories.",

Three families of codes\nare considered: Reed-Solomon codes, BCH codes, and Reed-Muller codes. In\nconjunction to the use of codes, we also analyze the role of the receiver. In\nparticular, heterodyne and Dolinar receivers are taken in consideration. The\nencoding and measurement schemes are connected by the probing step. As probe we\nconsider coherent states. In such simple manner, interesting results are\nobtained. As we show, for any fixed rate and code, there is a threshold under\nwhich using codes surpass optimal and sophisticated schemes.

Our method showed to decrease static error by\n$3.57^\\circ$ ($40.2$%) and $4.11^\\circ$ ($32.8$%) against state of the art and\nLOA by $5.4^\\circ$ ($49.0$%) and $16.0^\\circ$ ($74.6$%) against manual\nprocessing.\nConclusion: This suggests that pre-existing annotations can be an inexpensive\nresource in clinics to ease ill-posed and repetitive tasks like cross-section\nextraction for surveillance of aortic dissections.",

Schizophrenia(Sz) is a brain disorder that severely affects\nthe thinking, behaviour, and feelings of people all around the world.\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is proved to be an efficient biomarker in Sz\ndetection. EEG is a non-linear time-seriesi signal and utilizing it for\ninvestigation is rather crucial due to its non-linear structure. This paper\naims to improve the performance of EEG based Sz detection using a deep learning\napproach. A novel hybrid deep learning model known as SzHNN (Schizophrenia\nHybrid Neural Network), a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\nand Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been proposed. CNN network is used for\nlocal feature extraction and LSTM has been utilized for classification. The\nproposed model has been compared with CNN only, LSTM only, and machine\nlearning-based models. All the models have been evaluated on two different\ndatasets wherein Dataset 1 consists of 19 subjects and Dataset 2 consists of 16\nsubjects. Several experiments have been conducted for the same using various\nparametric settings on different frequency bands and using different sets of\nelectrodes on the scalp. Based on all the experiments, it is evident that the\nproposed hybrid model (SzHNN) provides the highest classification accuracy of\n99.9% in comparison to other existing models. The proposed model overcomes the\ninfluence of different frequency bands and even showed a much better accuracy\nof 91% with only 5 electrodes.

The existence of certain\nlinear transformations between such homomorphism tensor subspaces can be\ninterpreted both as homomorphism indistinguishability over a graph class and as\nfeasibility of an equational system.

    "abstract": "Various ocular diseases and high myopia influence the anatomical reference\npoint Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ) dimensions. Therefore, it is important to\nsegment and quantify the FAZs dimensions accurately. To the best of our\nknowledge, there is no automated tool or algorithms available to segment the\nFAZ's deep retinal layer. The paper describes a new open-access software with a\nuser-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) and compares the results with the\nground truth (manual segmentation).",
