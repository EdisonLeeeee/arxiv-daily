    "title": "An Exploratory Study of AI System Risk Assessment from the Lens of Data  Distribution and Uncertainty",
    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has become a driving force and has been widely adopted in\nmany domains and applications with competitive performance. In practice, to\nsolve the nontrivial and complicated tasks in real-world applications, DL is\noften not used standalone, but instead contributes as a piece of gadget of a\nlarger complex AI system. Although there comes a fast increasing trend to study\nthe quality issues of deep neural networks (DNNs) at the model level, few\nstudies have been performed to investigate the quality of DNNs at both the unit\nlevel and the potential impacts on the system level. More importantly, it also\nlacks systematic investigation on how to perform the risk assessment for AI\nsystems from unit level to system level. To bridge this gap, this paper\ninitiates an early exploratory study of AI system risk assessment from both the\ndata distribution and uncertainty angles to address these issues. We propose a\ngeneral framework with an exploratory study for analyzing AI systems. After\nlarge-scale (700+ experimental configurations and 5000+ GPU hours) experiments\nand in-depth investigations, we reached a few key interesting findings that\nhighlight the practical need and opportunities for more in-depth investigations\ninto AI systems.",

    "abstract": "Non-invasive brain-computer interface technology has been developed for\ndetecting human mental states with high performances. Detection of the pilots'\nmental states is particularly critical because their abnormal mental states\ncould cause catastrophic accidents. In this study, we presented the feasibility\nof classifying distraction levels (namely, normal state, low distraction, and\nhigh distraction) by applying the deep learning method. To the best of our\nknowledge, this study is the first attempt to classify distraction levels under\na flight environment. We proposed a model for classifying distraction levels. A\ntotal of ten pilots conducted the experiment in a simulated flight environment.\nThe grand-average accuracy was 0.8437 for classifying distraction levels across\nall subjects.

    "abstract": "Our work targets at searching feasible adversarial perturbation to attack a\nclassifier with high-dimensional categorical inputs in a domain-agnostic\nsetting. This is intrinsically an NP-hard knapsack problem where the\nexploration space becomes explosively larger as the feature dimension\nincreases. Without the help of domain knowledge, solving this problem via\nheuristic method, such as Branch-and-Bound, suffers from exponential\ncomplexity, yet can bring arbitrarily bad attack results. We address the\nchallenge via the lens of multi-armed bandit based combinatorial search. Our\nproposed method, namely FEAT, treats modifying each categorical feature as\npulling an arm in multi-armed bandit programming. Our objective is to achieve\nhighly efficient and effective attack using an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit\n(OMP)-enhanced Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) exploration strategy. Our\ntheoretical analysis bounding the regret gap of FEAT guarantees its practical\nattack performance. In empirical analysis, we compare FEAT with other\nstate-of-the-art domain-agnostic attack methods over various real-world\ncategorical data sets of different applications. Substantial experimental\nobservations confirm the expected efficiency and attack effectiveness of FEAT\napplied in different application scenarios.

    "abstract": "Research connecting text and images has recently seen several breakthroughs,\nwith models like CLIP, DALL-E 2, and Stable Diffusion. However, the connection\nbetween text and other visual modalities, such as lidar data, has received less\nattention, prohibited by the lack of text-lidar datasets. In this work, we\npropose LidarCLIP, a mapping from automotive point clouds to a pre-existing\nCLIP embedding space. Using image-lidar pairs, we supervise a point cloud\nencoder with the image CLIP embeddings, effectively relating text and lidar\ndata with the image domain as an intermediary. We show the effectiveness of\nLidarCLIP by demonstrating that lidar-based retrieval is generally on par with\nimage-based retrieval, but with complementary strengths and weaknesses. By\ncombining image and lidar features, we improve upon both single-modality\nmethods and enable a targeted search for challenging detection scenarios under\nadverse sensor conditions. We also use LidarCLIP as a tool to investigate\nfundamental lidar capabilities through natural language. Finally, we leverage\nour compatibility with CLIP to explore a range of applications, such as point\ncloud captioning and lidar-to-image generation, without any additional\ntraining. We hope LidarCLIP can inspire future work to dive deeper into\nconnections between text and point cloud understanding. Code and trained models\navailable at https://github.com/atonderski/lidarclip.",

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal machine learning is critically needed for a variety of\nsocietal applications, such as agricultural monitoring, hydrological forecast,\nand traffic management. These applications greatly rely on regional features\nthat characterize spatial and temporal differences. However, spatio-temporal\ndata are often complex and pose several unique challenges for machine learning\nmodels: 1) multiple models are needed to handle region-based data patterns that\nhave significant spatial heterogeneity across different locations; 2) local\nmodels trained on region-specific data have limited ability to adapt to other\nregions that have large diversity and abnormality; 3) spatial and temporal\nvariations entangle data complexity that requires more robust and adaptive\nmodels; 4) limited spatial-temporal data in real scenarios (e.g., crop yield\ndata is collected only once a year) makes the problems intrinsically\nchallenging. To bridge these gaps, we propose task-adaptive formulations and a\nmodel-agnostic meta-learning framework that ensembles regionally heterogeneous\ndata into location-sensitive meta tasks. We conduct task adaptation following\nan easy-to-hard task hierarchy in which different meta models are adapted to\ntasks of different difficulty levels. One major advantage of our proposed\nmethod is that it improves the model adaptation to a large number of\nheterogeneous tasks. It also enhances the model generalization by automatically\nadapting the meta model of the corresponding difficulty level to any new tasks.\nWe demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over a diverse set of\nbaselines and state-of-the-art meta-learning frameworks.

At inference time, the method only\nassumes knowledge of (i) a region of interest displaying the object in the\nimage and (ii) a CAD model of the observed object. The contributions of this\nwork are threefold. First, we present a 6D pose refiner based on a\nrender&compare strategy which can be applied to novel objects. The shape and\ncoordinate system of the novel object are provided as inputs to the network by\nrendering multiple synthetic views of the object's CAD model. Second, we\nintroduce a novel approach for coarse pose estimation which leverages a network\ntrained to classify whether the pose error between a synthetic rendering and an\nobserved image of the same object can be corrected by the refiner. Third, we\nintroduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of photorealistic images of thousands\nof objects with diverse visual and shape properties and show that this\ndiversity is crucial to obtain good generalization performance on novel\nobjects. We train our approach on this large synthetic dataset and apply it\nwithout retraining to hundreds of novel objects in real images from several\npose estimation benchmarks. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance\non the ModelNet and YCB-Video datasets. An extensive evaluation on the 7 core\ndatasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates that our approach achieves\nperformance competitive with existing approaches that require access to the\ntarget objects during training.

As a result, it is necessary to develop\nregularization methods that can be used to compute reliable approximate\nsolutions. A regularization method provides of a family of stable\nreconstructions that converge to an exact solution of the noise-free problem as\nthe noise level tends to zero. The standard regularization technique is defined\nby variational image reconstruction, which minimizes a data discrepancy\naugmented by a regularizer. The actual numerical implementation makes use of\niterative methods, often involving proximal mappings of the regularizer. In\nrecent years, plug-and-play image reconstruction (PnP) has been developed as a\nnew powerful generalization of variational methods based on replacing proximal\nmappings by more general image denoisers. While PnP iterations yield excellent\nresults, neither stability nor convergence in the sense of regularization has\nbeen studied so far. In this work, we extend the idea of PnP by considering\nfamilies of PnP iterations, each being accompanied by its own denoiser. As our\nmain theoretical result, we show that such PnP reconstructions lead to stable\nand convergent regularization methods.

Unlike traditional approaches,\nthis paper proposes a novel infrastructure vulnerability assessment framework\nthat accounts for: various types of infrastructure interdependencies including\nphysical, logical and geographical from a holistic perspective; lack\nof/incomplete information on supply-demand flow characteristics of\ninterdependent infrastructure; and, unavailability/inadequate data on\ninfrastructure network topology and/or interdependencies. Specifically, this\npaper models multi-infrastructure vulnerabilities leveraging simulation-based\nhybrid approach coupled with time-dependent Bayesian network analysis while\nconsidering cascading failures within and across CIS networks, under incomplete\ninformation. Existing synthetic data on electricity, water and supply chain\nnetworks are used to implement/validate the framework.

It is observed that higher the\ninitial failure rate of the components, higher is the vulnerability of the\ninfrastructure, highlighting the importance of modernizing and upgrading the\ninfrastructure system aiming to reduce the initial failure probabilities.

    "abstract": "Many commodity crops have growth stages during which they are particularly\nvulnerable to stress-induced yield loss. In-season crop progress information is\nuseful for quantifying crop risk, and satellite remote sensing (RS) can be used\nto track progress at regional scales. At present, all existing RS-based crop\nprogress estimation (CPE) methods which target crop-specific stages rely on\nground truth data for training/calibration. This reliance on ground survey data\nconfines CPE methods to surveyed regions, limiting their utility. In this\nstudy, a new method is developed for conducting RS-based in-season CPE in\nunsurveyed regions by combining data from surveyed regions with synthetic crop\nprogress data generated for an unsurveyed region. Corn-growing zones in\nArgentina were used as surrogate 'unsurveyed' regions. Existing weather\ngeneration, crop growth, and optical radiative transfer models were linked to\nproduce synthetic weather, crop progress, and canopy reflectance data. A neural\nnetwork (NN) method based upon bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory was\ntrained separately on surveyed data, synthetic data, and two different\ncombinations of surveyed and synthetic data. A stopping criterion was developed\nwhich uses the weighted divergence of surveyed and synthetic data validation\nloss. Net F1 scores across all crop progress stages increased by 8.7% when\ntrained on a combination of surveyed region and synthetic data, and overall\nperformance was only 21% lower than when the NN was trained on surveyed data\nand applied in the US Midwest. Performance gain from synthetic data was\ngreatest in zones with dual planting windows, while the inclusion of surveyed\nregion data from the US Midwest helped mitigate NN sensitivity to noise in NDVI\ndata. Overall results suggest in-season CPE in other unsurveyed regions may be\npossible with increased quantity and variety of synthetic crop progress data.",

    "abstract": "Metaverse over wireless networks is an emerging use case of the sixth\ngeneration (6G) wireless systems, posing unprecedented challenges in terms of\nits multi-modal data transmissions with stringent latency and reliability\nrequirements. Towards enabling this wireless metaverse, in this article we\npropose a novel semantic communication (SC) framework by decomposing the\nmetaverse into human/machine agent-specific semantic multiverses (SMs). An SM\nstored at each agent comprises a semantic encoder and a generator, leveraging\nrecent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI). To improve\ncommunication efficiency, the encoder learns the semantic representations (SRs)\nof multi-modal data, while the generator learns how to manipulate them for\nlocally rendering scenes and interactions in the metaverse. Since these learned\nSMs are biased towards local environments, their success hinges on\nsynchronizing heterogeneous SMs in the background while communicating SRs in\nthe foreground, turning the wireless metaverse problem into the problem of\nsemantic multiverse communication (SMC). Based on this SMC architecture, we\npropose several promising algorithmic and analytic tools for modeling and\ndesigning SMC, ranging from distributed learning and multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) to signaling games and symbolic AI.",

    "abstract": "Owing to the prohibitive costs of generating large amounts of labeled data,\nprogrammatic weak supervision is a growing paradigm within machine learning. In\nthis setting, users design heuristics that provide noisy labels for subsets of\nthe data. These weak labels are combined (typically via a graphical model) to\nform pseudolabels, which are then used to train a downstream model. In this\nwork, we question a foundational premise of the typical weakly supervised\nlearning pipeline: given that the heuristic provides all ``label\" information,\nwhy do we need to generate pseudolabels at all? Instead, we propose to directly\ntransform the heuristics themselves into corresponding loss functions that\npenalize differences between our model and the heuristic. By constructing\nlosses directly from the heuristics, we can incorporate more information than\nis used in the standard weakly supervised pipeline, such as how the heuristics\nmake their decisions, which explicitly informs feature selection during\ntraining. We call our method Losses over Labels (LoL) as it creates losses\ndirectly from heuristics without going through the intermediate step of a\nlabel. We show that LoL improves upon existing weak supervision methods on\nseveral benchmark text and image classification tasks and further demonstrate\nthat incorporating gradient information leads to better performance on almost\nevery task.",

Several factors such as\ndata, model prediction, hyperparameters used in training the model, and random\ninitialization can all influence downstream explanations. While previous work\nempirically hinted that explanations (E) may have little relationship with the\nprediction (Y), there is a lack of conclusive study to quantify this\nrelationship. Our work borrows tools from causal inference to systematically\nassay this relationship. More specifically, we measure the relationship between\nE and Y by measuring the treatment effect when intervening on their causal\nancestors (hyperparameters) (inputs to generate saliency-based Es or Ys). We\ndiscover that Y's relative direct influence on E follows an odd pattern; the\ninfluence is higher in the lowest-performing models than in mid-performing\nmodels, and it then decreases in the top-performing models.

    "title": "Particle-Based Score Estimation for State Space Model Learning in  Autonomous Driving",
    "abstract": "Multi-object state estimation is a fundamental problem for robotic\napplications where a robot must interact with other moving objects. Typically,\nother objects' relevant state features are not directly observable, and must\ninstead be inferred from observations. Particle filtering can perform such\ninference given approximate transition and observation models. However, these\nmodels are often unknown a priori, yielding a difficult parameter estimation\nproblem since observations jointly carry transition and observation noise. In\nthis work, we consider learning maximum-likelihood parameters using particle\nmethods. Recent methods addressing this problem typically differentiate through\ntime in a particle filter, which requires workarounds to the non-differentiable\nresampling step, that yield biased or high variance gradient estimates. By\ncontrast, we exploit Fisher's identity to obtain a particle-based approximation\nof the score function (the gradient of the log likelihood) that yields a low\nvariance estimate while only requiring stepwise differentiation through the\ntransition and observation models. We apply our method to real data collected\nfrom autonomous vehicles (AVs) and show that it learns better models than\nexisting techniques and is more stable in training, yielding an effective\nsmoother for tracking the trajectories of vehicles around an AV.",

    "abstract": "With the recent advances in video and 3D understanding, novel 4D\nspatio-temporal challenges fusing both concepts have emerged. Towards this\ndirection, the Ego4D Episodic Memory Benchmark proposed a task for Visual\nQueries with 3D Localization (VQ3D). Given an egocentric video clip and an\nimage crop depicting a query object, the goal is to localize the 3D position of\nthe center of that query object with respect to the camera pose of a query\nframe. Current methods tackle the problem of VQ3D by lifting the 2D\nlocalization results of the sister task Visual Queries with 2D Localization\n(VQ2D) into a 3D reconstruction. Yet, we point out that the low number of\nQueries with Poses (QwP) from previous VQ3D methods severally hinders their\noverall success rate and highlights the need for further effort in 3D modeling\nto tackle the VQ3D task. In this work, we formalize a pipeline that better\nentangles 3D multiview geometry with 2D object retrieval from egocentric\nvideos. We estimate more robust camera poses, leading to more successful object\nqueries and substantially improved VQ3D performance. In practice, our method\nreaches a top-1 overall success rate of 86.36% on the Ego4D Episodic Memory\nBenchmark VQ3D, a 10x improvement over the previous state-of-the-art. In\naddition, we provide a complete empirical study highlighting the remaining\nchallenges in VQ3D.",

    "abstract": "Human speech can be characterized by different components, including semantic\ncontent, speaker identity and prosodic information. Significant progress has\nbeen made in disentangling representations for semantic content and speaker\nidentity in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and speaker verification tasks\nrespectively. However, it is still an open challenging research question to\nextract prosodic information because of the intrinsic association of different\nattributes, such as timbre and rhythm, and because of the need for unsupervised\ntraining schemes to achieve robust large-scale and speaker-independent ASR. The\naim of this paper is to address the disentanglement of emotional prosody from\nspeech based on unsupervised reconstruction. Specifically, we identify, design,\nimplement and integrate three crucial components in our proposed speech\nreconstruction model Prosody2Vec: (1) a unit encoder that transforms speech\nsignals into discrete units for semantic content, (2) a pretrained speaker\nverification model to generate speaker identity embeddings, and (3) a trainable\nprosody encoder to learn prosody representations. We first pretrain the\nProsody2Vec representations on unlabelled emotional speech corpora, then\nfine-tune the model on specific datasets to perform Speech Emotion Recognition\n(SER) and Emotional Voice Conversion (EVC) tasks. Both objective and subjective\nevaluations on the EVC task suggest that Prosody2Vec effectively captures\ngeneral prosodic features that can be smoothly transferred to other emotional\nspeech. In addition, our SER experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset reveal that the\nprosody features learned by Prosody2Vec are complementary and beneficial for\nthe performance of widely used speech pretraining models and surpass the\nstate-of-the-art methods when combining Prosody2Vec with HuBERT\nrepresentations.

    "abstract": "Electricity markets are transforming from the dominance of conventional\nenergy resources (CERs), e.g., fossil fuels, to low-carbon energy resources\n(LERs), e.g., renewables and energy storage. This work examines market\nmechanisms to incentivize LER investments, while ensuring adequate market\nrevenues for investors, guiding investors' strategic investments towards social\noptimum, and protecting consumers from scarcity prices. To reduce the impact of\nexcessive scarcity prices, we present a new market mechanism, which consists of\na Penalty payment for lost load, a supply Incentive, and an energy price Uplift\n(PIU). We establish a game-theoretical framework to analyze market equilibrium.\nWe prove that one Nash equilibrium under the penalty payment and supply\nincentive can reach the social optimum given quadratic supply costs of CERs.\nAlthough the price uplift can ensure adequate revenues, the resulting system\ncost deviates from the social optimum while the gap decreases as more CERs\nretire. Furthermore, under the traditional marginal-cost pricing (MCP)\nmechanism, investors may withhold investments to cause scarcity prices, but\nsuch behavior is absent under the PIU mechanism. Simulation results show that\nthe PIU mechanism can reduce consumers' costs by over 30% compared with the MCP\nmechanism by reducing excessive revenues of low-cost CERs from scarcity prices.",

    "abstract": "In many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL), performing\nactions requires consuming certain types of resources that are\nnon-replenishable in each episode. Typical applications include robotic control\nwith limited energy and video games with consumable items. In tasks with\nnon-replenishable resources, we observe that popular RL methods such as soft\nactor critic suffer from poor sample efficiency. The major reason is that, they\ntend to exhaust resources fast and thus the subsequent exploration is severely\nrestricted due to the absence of resources. To address this challenge, we first\nformalize the aforementioned problem as a resource-restricted reinforcement\nlearning, and then propose a novel resource-aware exploration bonus (RAEB) to\nmake reasonable usage of resources. An appealing feature of RAEB is that, it\ncan significantly reduce unnecessary resource-consuming trials while\neffectively encouraging the agent to explore unvisited states. Experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed RAEB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nexploration strategies in resource-restricted reinforcement learning\nenvironments, improving the sample efficiency by up to an order of magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Learning a risk-aware policy is essential but rather challenging in\nunstructured robotic tasks. Safe reinforcement learning methods open up new\npossibilities to tackle this problem. However, the conservative policy updates\nmake it intractable to achieve sufficient exploration and desirable performance\nin complex, sample-expensive environments. In this paper, we propose a\ndual-agent safe reinforcement learning strategy consisting of a baseline and a\nsafe agent. Such a decoupled framework enables high flexibility, data\nefficiency and risk-awareness for RL-based control. Concretely, the baseline\nagent is responsible for maximizing rewards under standard RL settings. Thus,\nit is compatible with off-the-shelf training techniques of unconstrained\noptimization, exploration and exploitation. On the other hand, the safe agent\nmimics the baseline agent for policy improvement and learns to fulfill safety\nconstraints via off-policy RL tuning. In contrast to training from scratch,\nsafe policy correction requires significantly fewer interactions to obtain a\nnear-optimal policy. The dual policies can be optimized synchronously via a\nshared replay buffer, or leveraging the pre-trained model or the\nnon-learning-based controller as a fixed baseline agent. Experimental results\nshow that our approach can learn feasible skills without prior knowledge as\nwell as deriving risk-averse counterparts from pre-trained unsafe policies.

    "abstract": "The standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) can underperform on certain\nminority groups (i.e., waterbirds in lands or landbirds in water) due to the\nspurious correlation between the input and its label. Several studies have\nimproved the worst-group accuracy by focusing on the high-loss samples. The\nhypothesis behind this is that such high-loss samples are\n\\textit{spurious-cue-free} (SCF) samples. However, these approaches can be\nproblematic since the high-loss samples may also be samples with noisy labels\nin the real-world scenarios. To resolve this issue, we utilize the predictive\nuncertainty of a model to improve the worst-group accuracy under noisy labels.\nTo motivate this, we theoretically show that the high-uncertainty samples are\nthe SCF samples in the binary classification problem. This theoretical result\nimplies that the predictive uncertainty is an adequate indicator to identify\nSCF samples in a noisy label setting. Motivated from this, we propose a novel\nENtropy based Debiasing (END) framework that prevents models from learning the\nspurious cues while being robust to the noisy labels. In the END framework, we\nfirst train the \\textit{identification model} to obtain the SCF samples from a\ntraining set using its predictive uncertainty. Then, another model is trained\non the dataset augmented with an oversampled SCF set. The experimental results\nshow that our END framework outperforms other strong baselines on several\nreal-world benchmarks that consider both the noisy labels and the\nspurious-cues.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, the prevalence of wireless devices has become one of\nthe essential sources of electromagnetic (EM) radiation to the public. Facing\nwith the swift development of wireless communications, people are skeptical\nabout the risks of long-term exposure to EM radiation. As EM exposure is\nrequired to be restricted at user terminals, it is inefficient to blindly\ndecrease the transmit power, which leads to limited spectral efficiency and\nenergy efficiency (EE). Recently, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has\nbeen proposed as an effective way to provide higher wireless transmission\nperformance, which is a promising technology for future wireless\ncommunications. To this end, we propose using RSMA to increase the EE of\nmassive MIMO uplink while limiting the EM exposure of users. In particularly,\nwe investigate the optimization of the transmit covariance matrices and\ndecoding order using statistical channel state information (CSI). The problem\nis formulated as non-convex mixed integer program, which is in general\ndifficult to handle. We first propose a modified water-filling scheme to obtain\nthe transmit covariance matrices with fixed decoding order. Then, a greedy\napproach is proposed to obtain the decoding permutation.

Quite a great amount of studies have been devoted to designing complex\nalgorithms to improve recommendation performance, where deep learning methods\naccount for the majority. However, most of these methods are black-box ones and\nignore to provide moderate explanations to facilitate users' understanding,\nwhich thus might lead to lowered user satisfaction and reduced system revenues.\nTherefore, in our study, we propose a generic Reinforced Explainable framework\nwith Knowledge graph for Session-based recommendation (i.e., REKS), which\nstrives to improve the existing black-box SR models (denoted as non-explainable\nones) with Markov decision process. In particular, we construct a knowledge\ngraph with session behaviors and treat SR models as part of the policy network\nof Markov decision process. Based on our particularly designed state vector,\nreward strategy, and loss function, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based\nframework not only achieves improved recommendation accuracy, but also provides\nappropriate explanations at the same time. Finally, we instantiate the REKS in\nfive representative, state-of-the-art SR models (i.e., GRU4REC, NARM, SR-GNN,\nGCSAN, BERT4REC), whereby extensive experiments towards these methods on four\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both recommendation\nand explanation tasks.",

This\ncombination, as demonstrated in this paper, is of great benefit in reducing the\ncomputational cost of using a local refinement mesh and a higher-order\nphase-field, which needs higher derivatives of basis functions. Compared with\nother approaches using a local refinement mesh, the Virtual\nUncommon-Knot-Inserted Master-Slave (VUKIMS) method presented here is not only\nsimple to implement but can also reduce the variable numbers. VUKIMS is an\noutstanding choice in order to establish a local refinement mesh, i.e. a\nnon-conforming mesh, in a multi-patch problem. A phase-field model is an\nefficient approach for various complicated crack patterns, including those with\nor without an initial crack path, curved cracks, crack coalescence, and crack\npropagation through holes. The paper demonstrates that cubic NURBS elements are\nideal for balancing the computational cost and the accuracy because they can\nproduce accurate solutions by utilising a lower degree of freedom number than\nan extremely fine mesh of first-order B-spline elements.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL), which can extract the information shared between\ndifferent contrastive views, has become a popular paradigm for vision\nrepresentation learning. Inspired by the success in computer vision, recent\nwork introduces CL into graph modeling, dubbed as graph contrastive learning\n(GCL). However, generating contrastive views in graphs is more challenging than\nthat in images, since we have little prior knowledge on how to significantly\naugment a graph without changing its labels. We argue that typical data\naugmentation techniques (e.g., edge dropping) in GCL cannot generate diverse\nenough contrastive views to filter out noises. Moreover, previous GCL methods\nemploy two view encoders with exactly the same neural architecture and tied\nparameters, which further harms the diversity of augmented views. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel paradigm named model augmented GCL\n(MA-GCL), which will focus on manipulating the architectures of view encoders\ninstead of perturbing graph inputs. Specifically, we present three\neasy-to-implement model augmentation tricks for GCL, namely asymmetric, random\nand shuffling, which can respectively help alleviate high- frequency noises,\nenrich training instances and bring safer augmentations. All three tricks are\ncompatible with typical data augmentations. Experimental results show that\nMA-GCL can achieve state-of-the-art performance on node classification\nbenchmarks by applying the three tricks on a simple base model.

However, the prediction accuracy will decrease because of the\nquantization noise, especially in extremely low-bit settings. How to determine\nthe appropriate quantization parameters (e.g., scaling factors and rounding of\nweights) is the main problem facing now. Many existing methods determine the\nquantization parameters by minimizing the distance between features before and\nafter quantization. Using this distance as the metric to optimize the\nquantization parameters only considers local information. We analyze the\nproblem of minimizing local metrics and indicate that it would not result in\noptimal quantization parameters. Furthermore, the quantized model suffers from\noverfitting due to the small number of calibration samples in PTQ. In this\npaper, we propose PD-Quant to solve the problems.

    "title": "VINet: Lightweight, Scalable, and Heterogeneous Cooperative Perception  for 3D Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Utilizing the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the computer\nvision community is now witnessing an unprecedented evolution in all kinds of\nperception tasks, particularly in object detection. Based on multiple spatially\nseparated perception nodes, Cooperative Perception (CP) has emerged to\nsignificantly advance the perception of automated driving. However, current\ncooperative object detection methods mainly focus on ego-vehicle efficiency\nwithout considering the practical issues of system-wide costs. In this paper,\nwe introduce VINet, a unified deep learning-based CP network for scalable,\nlightweight, and heterogeneous cooperative 3D object detection. VINet is the\nfirst CP method designed from the standpoint of large-scale system-level\nimplementation and can be divided into three main phases: 1) Global\nPre-Processing and Lightweight Feature Extraction which prepare the data into\nglobal style and extract features for cooperation in a lightweight manner; 2)\nTwo-Stream Fusion which fuses the features from scalable and heterogeneous\nperception nodes; and 3) Central Feature Backbone and 3D Detection Head which\nfurther process the fused features and generate cooperative detection results.\nA cooperative perception platform is designed and developed for CP dataset\nacquisition and several baselines are compared during the experiments. The\nexperimental analysis shows that VINet can achieve remarkable improvements for\npedestrians and cars with 2x less system-wide computational costs and 12x less\nsystem-wide communicational costs.",

    "title": "CLIPSep: Learning Text-queried Sound Separation with Noisy Unlabeled  Videos",
    "abstract": "Recent years have seen progress beyond domain-specific sound separation for\nspeech or music towards universal sound separation for arbitrary sounds. Prior\nwork on universal sound separation has investigated separating a target sound\nout of an audio mixture given a text query. Such text-queried sound separation\nsystems provide a natural and scalable interface for specifying arbitrary\ntarget sounds. However, supervised text-queried sound separation systems\nrequire costly labeled audio-text pairs for training. Moreover, the audio\nprovided in existing datasets is often recorded in a controlled environment,\ncausing a considerable generalization gap to noisy audio in the wild. In this\nwork, we aim to approach text-queried universal sound separation by using only\nunlabeled data. We propose to leverage the visual modality as a bridge to learn\nthe desired audio-textual correspondence. The proposed CLIPSep model first\nencodes the input query into a query vector using the contrastive\nlanguage-image pretraining (CLIP) model, and the query vector is then used to\ncondition an audio separation model to separate out the target sound. While the\nmodel is trained on image-audio pairs extracted from unlabeled videos, at test\ntime we can instead query the model with text inputs in a zero-shot setting,\nthanks to the joint language-image embedding learned by the CLIP model.\nFurther, videos in the wild often contain off-screen sounds and background\nnoise that may hinder the model from learning the desired audio-textual\ncorrespondence. To address this problem, we further propose an approach called\nnoise invariant training for training a query-based sound separation model on\nnoisy data. Experimental results show that the proposed models successfully\nlearn text-queried universal sound separation using only noisy unlabeled\nvideos, even achieving competitive performance against a supervised model in\nsome settings.",

We\ntackle these issues by proposing deep negative correlation classification\n(DNCC), in which the accuracy and diversity trade-off is systematically\ncontrolled by decomposing the loss function seamlessly into individual accuracy\nand the correlation between individual models and the ensemble. DNCC yields a\ndeep classification ensemble where the individual estimator is both accurate\nand negatively correlated.

Although\ncurrent systems have attained unprecedented performances for such tasks, the\nnonuniform distribution of word senses during training generally results in\nsystems performing poorly on rare senses. To this end, we consider data\naugmentation to increase the frequency of these least frequent senses (LFS) to\nreduce the distributional bias of senses during training.

    "abstract": "Large-scale cross-modal pre-training paradigms have recently shown ubiquitous\nsuccess on a wide range of downstream tasks, e.g., zero-shot classification,\nretrieval and image captioning. However, their successes highly rely on the\nscale and quality of web-crawled data that naturally contain incomplete and\nnoisy information (e.g., wrong or irrelevant content). Existing works either\ndesign manual rules to clean data or generate pseudo-targets as auxiliary\nsignals for reducing noise impact, which do not explicitly tackle both the\nincorrect and incomplete challenges simultaneously. In this paper, to\nautomatically mitigate the impact of noise by solely mining over existing data,\nwe propose a principled Noise-robust Language-Image Pre-training framework\n(NLIP) to stabilize pre-training via two schemes: noise-harmonization and\nnoise-completion. First, in noise-harmonization scheme, NLIP estimates the\nnoise probability of each pair according to the memorization effect of\ncross-modal transformers, then adopts noise-adaptive regularization to\nharmonize the cross-modal alignments with varying degrees. Second, in\nnoise-completion scheme, to enrich the missing object information of text, NLIP\ninjects a concept-conditioned cross-modal decoder to obtain semantic-consistent\nsynthetic captions to complete noisy ones, which uses the retrieved visual\nconcepts (i.e., objects' names) for the corresponding image to guide captioning\ngeneration. By collaboratively optimizing noise-harmonization and\nnoise-completion schemes, our NLIP can alleviate the common noise effects\nduring image-text pre-training in a more efficient way.

    "abstract": "The de-anonymization of users from anonymized microdata through matching or\naligning with publicly-available correlated databases has been of scientific\ninterest recently. While most of the rigorous analyses of database matching\nhave focused on random-distortion models, the adversarial-distortion models\nhave been wanting in the relevant literature. In this work, motivated by\nsynchronization errors in the sampling of time-indexed microdata, matching\n(alignment) of random databases under adversarial column deletions is\ninvestigated. It is assumed that a constrained adversary, which observes the\nanonymized database, can delete up to a $\\delta$ fraction of the columns\n(attributes) to hinder matching and preserve privacy. Column histograms of the\ntwo databases are utilized as permutation-invariant features to detect the\ncolumn deletion pattern chosen by the adversary. The detection of the column\ndeletion pattern is then followed by an exact row (user) matching scheme. The\nworst-case analysis of this two-phase scheme yields a sufficient condition for\nthe successful matching of the two databases, under the near-perfect recovery\ncondition. A more detailed investigation of the error probability leads to a\ntight necessary condition on the database growth rate, and in turn, to a\nsingle-letter characterization of the adversarial matching capacity. This\nadversarial matching capacity is shown to be significantly lower than the\n\\say{random} matching capacity, where the column deletions occur randomly.\nOverall, our results analytically demonstrate the privacy-wise advantages of\nadversarial mechanisms over random ones during the publication of anonymized\ntime-indexed data.",

There have been demands for making the\nanalytics process more interactive and adaptive, especially for long running\njobs.

This\ndissertation is motivated by these calls for improvement in data processing and\nthe experiences over the past few years while working on the Texera project,\nwhich is a collaborative data analytics service being developed at UC Irvine.\nThis dissertation mainly consists of three parts.

    "abstract": "It can be easy and even fun to sketch humans in different poses. In contrast,\ncreating those same poses on a 3D graphics \"mannequin\" is comparatively\ntedious. Yet 3D body poses are necessary for various downstream applications.\nWe seek to preserve the convenience of 2D sketching while giving users of\ndifferent skill levels the flexibility to accurately and more quickly\npose\\slash refine a 3D mannequin.\nAt the core of the interactive system, we propose a machine-learning model\nfor inferring the 3D pose of a CG mannequin from sketches of humans drawn in a\ncylinder-person style. Training such a model is challenging because of artist\nvariability, a lack of sketch training data with corresponding ground truth 3D\nposes, and the high dimensionality of human pose-space. Our unique approach to\nsynthesizing vector graphics training data underpins our integrated\nML-and-kinematics system.

Domain\ngeneralization aims to tackle this issue by learning a model that can\ngeneralize to unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a new approach that\naims to explicitly remove domain-specific features for domain generalization.\nFollowing this approach, we propose a novel framework called Learning and\nRemoving Domain-specific features for Generalization (LRDG) that learns a\ndomain-invariant model by tactically removing domain-specific features from the\ninput images. Specifically, we design a classifier to effectively learn the\ndomain-specific features for each source domain, respectively. We then develop\nan encoder-decoder network to map each input image into a new image space where\nthe learned domain-specific features are removed. With the images output by the\nencoder-decoder network, another classifier is designed to learn the\ndomain-invariant features to conduct image classification.

As a constraint for preventing from accuracy degradation, we first\nconsider the one that the decision paths of all the given feature vectors must\nnot change. For a branching condition that a value of a certain feature is at\nmost a given threshold, the set of values satisfying such constraint can be\nrepresented as an interval. Thus, the problem is reduced to the problem of\nfinding the minimum set intersecting all the constraint-satisfying intervals\nfor each set of branching conditions on the same feature.

DNN predictions cannot be assumed to be always\ncorrect for several reasons, among which the huge input space that is dealt\nwith, the ambiguity of some inputs data, as well as the intrinsic properties of\nlearning algorithms, which can provide only statistical warranties. Hence,\ndevelopers have to cope with some residual error probability. An architectural\npattern commonly adopted to manage failure-prone components is the supervisor,\nan additional component that can estimate the reliability of the predictions\nmade by untrusted (e.g., DNN) components and can activate an automated healing\nprocedure when these are likely to fail, ensuring that the Deep Learning based\nSystem (DLS) does not cause damages, despite its main functionality being\nsuspended.\nIn this paper, we consider DLS that implement a supervisor by means of\nuncertainty estimation.

The data structure variant of the problem is a longstanding\nopen problem: Efficiently preprocess $P$, so that for any $Q$ given at query\ntime, one can efficiently approximate their Fr\\'{e}chet distance. There exist\nconditional lower bounds that prohibit $(1 + \\varepsilon)$-approximate\nFr\\'{e}chet distance computations in subquadratic time, even when preprocessing\n$P$ using any polynomial amount of time and space. As a consequence, the\nproblem has been studied under various restrictions: restricting $Q$ to be a\n(horizontal) segment, or requiring $P$ and $Q$ to be so-called \\emph{realistic}\ninput curves.\nWe give a data structure for $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate discrete\nFr\\'{e}chet distance in any metric space $\\mathcal{X}$ between a realistic\ninput curve $P$ and any query curve $Q$. After preprocessing the input curve\n$P$ (of length $|P|=n$) in $O(n \\log n)$ time, we may answer queries specifying\na query curve $Q$ and an $\\varepsilon$, and output a value $d(P,Q)$ which is at\nmost a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-factor away from the true Fr\\'{e}chet distance between\n$Q$ and $P$.

Our query time is\nasymptotically linear in $|Q|=m$, $\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}$, $\\log n$, and the\nrealism parameter $c$ or $\\kappa$.\nThe method presented in this paper simplifies and generalizes previous\ncontributions to the static problem variant. We obtain efficient queries (and\ntherefore static algorithms) for Fr\\'{e}chet distance computation in\nhigh-dimensional spaces and other metric spaces (e.g., when $\\mathcal{X}$ is a\ngraph under the shortest path metric).

Our large-scale experiments involve models trained on up to two\nbillion image-text pairs and identify power law scaling for multiple downstream\ntasks including zero-shot classification, retrieval, linear probing, and\nend-to-end fine-tuning. We find that the training distribution plays a key role\nin scaling laws as the OpenAI and OpenCLIP models exhibit different scaling\nbehavior despite identical model architectures and similar training recipes. We\nopen-source our evaluation workflow and all models, including the largest\npublic CLIP models, to ensure reproducibility and make scaling laws research\nmore accessible.

    "title": "Uncertain Facial Expression Recognition via Multi-task Assisted  Correction",
    "abstract": "Deep models for facial expression recognition achieve high performance by\ntraining on large-scale labeled data. However, publicly available datasets\ncontain uncertain facial expressions caused by ambiguous annotations or\nconfusing emotions, which could severely decline the robustness. Previous\nstudies usually follow the bias elimination method in general tasks without\nconsidering the uncertainty problem from the perspective of different\ncorresponding sources. In this paper, we propose a novel method of multi-task\nassisted correction in addressing uncertain facial expression recognition\ncalled MTAC. Specifically, a confidence estimation block and a weighted\nregularization module are applied to highlight solid samples and suppress\nuncertain samples in every batch. In addition, two auxiliary tasks, i.e.,\naction unit detection and valence-arousal measurement, are introduced to learn\nsemantic distributions from a data-driven AU graph and mitigate category\nimbalance based on latent dependencies between discrete and continuous\nemotions, respectively. Moreover, a re-labeling strategy guided by\nfeature-level similarity constraint further generates new labels for identified\nuncertain samples to promote model learning. The proposed method can flexibly\ncombine with existing frameworks in a fully-supervised or weakly-supervised\nmanner. Experiments on RAF-DB, AffectNet, and AffWild2 datasets demonstrate\nthat the MTAC obtains substantial improvements over baselines when facing\nsynthetic and real uncertainties and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

While 5G was strongly focused on improvements on QoS and QoS\nguarantees that are necessary for industrial deployments, 6G will have a\ndisruptive impact on possible use cases. Here, nearly each use case requires\ntime synchronization of the involved systems. While PTP in its variations, e.g.\nIEEE 1588 v2.1 or IEEE 802.1AS, has established as standard for wireline\nsystems, time synchronization of wireless or hybrid systems is still subject to\nresearch. Thus, the so-called RBIS protocol, which was originally developed and\ninvestigated for Wi-Fi, is mapped to 5G. This is possible, because both systems\nare infrastructure based and a suitable broadcast that fits to the requirements\nof RBIS protocol can be found in the control layer of 5G NR. Even if the 1\nmicrosecond requirement that is required by some applications is not yet\ncracked, the accuracy of 1.3 microseconds and precision of <4.3 microseconds\nfor non-invasive extension of existing 5G deployments is highly promising.",

This\npaper proposes that operating entirely in the complex domain increases the\noverall performance of complex-valued models. A novel, fully complex-valued\nlearning scheme is proposed to train a Fully Complex-valued Convolutional\nNeural Network (FC-CNN) using a newly proposed complex-valued loss function and\ntraining strategy.

The entire data\ncommunication is managed using Robot Operating System which provides a robust\nplatform for implementation of Robotics Projects.

Sensor fusion is performed\non the data received from the different sensors to improve the accuracy of the\ndecision making and inferences that we derive from the data. This data is then\nused to create a localized map of the environment. In this step, the position\nof the vehicle is obtained with respect to the Mapping done using the sensor\ndata.The different SLAM techniques used for this purpose are Hector Mapping and\nGMapping which are widely used mapping techniques in ROS. Apart from SLAM that\nprimarily uses LIDAR data, Visual Odometry is implemented using a Monocular\nCamera. The sensor fused data is then used by Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization\nfor car localization. Using the localized map developed, Path Planning\ntechniques like \"TEB planner\" and \"Dynamic Window Approach\" are implemented for\nautonomous navigation of the vehicle. The last step in the Project is the\nimplantation of Control which is the final decision making block in the\npipeline that gives speed and steering data for the navigation that is\ncompatible with Ackermann Kinematics.

    "abstract": "Recent research has reported a performance degradation in self-supervised\ncontrastive learning for specially designed efficient networks, such as\nMobileNet and EfficientNet. A common practice to address this problem is to\nintroduce a pretrained contrastive teacher model and train the lightweight\nnetworks with distillation signals generated by the teacher. However, it is\ntime and resource consuming to pretrain a teacher model when it is not\navailable. In this work, we aim to establish a stronger baseline for\nlightweight contrastive models without using a pretrained teacher model.\nSpecifically, we show that the optimal recipe for efficient models is different\nfrom that of larger models, and using the same training settings as ResNet50,\nas previous research does, is inappropriate. Additionally, we observe a common\nissu e in contrastive learning where either the positive or negative views can\nbe noisy, and propose a smoothed version of InfoNCE loss to alleviate this\nproblem. As a result, we successfully improve the linear evaluation results\nfrom 36.3\\% to 62.3\\% for MobileNet-V3-Large and from 42.2\\% to 65.8\\% for\nEfficientNet-B0 on ImageNet, closing the accuracy gap to ResNet50 with\n$5\\times$ fewer parameters.

    "abstract": "Recently studies on time-domain audio separation networks (TasNets) have made\na great stride in speech separation. One of the most representative TasNets is\na network with a dual-path segmentation approach. However, the original model\ncalled DPRNN used a fixed feature dimension and unchanged segment size\nthroughout all layers of the network. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale\nfeature fusion transformer network (MSFFT-Net) based on the conventional\ndual-path structure for single-channel speech separation. Unlike the\nconventional dual-path structure where only one processing path exists,\nadopting several iterative blocks with alternative intra-chunk and inter-chunk\noperations to capture local and global context information, the proposed\nMSFFT-Net has multiple parallel processing paths where the feature information\ncan be exchanged between multiple parallel processing paths. Experiments show\nthat our proposed networks based on multi-scale feature fusion structure have\nachieved better results than the original dual-path model on the benchmark\ndataset-WSJ0-2mix, where the SI-SNRi score of MSFFT-3P is 20.7dB (1.47%\nimprovement), and MSFFT-2P is 21.0dB (3.45% improvement), which achieves SOTA\non WSJ0-2mix without any data augmentation method.",

E.g., a human pilot\nis still required in EUROCONTROL's ESCAPE lite simulator (see\nhttps://www.eurocontrol.int/simulator/escape) during ATCo training. However,\nthis need can be substituted by an automatic system that could act as a pilot.\nIn this paper, we aim to develop and integrate a pseudo-pilot agent into the\nATCo training pipeline by merging diverse artificial intelligence (AI) powered\nmodules. The system understands the voice communications issued by the ATCo,\nand, in turn, it generates a spoken prompt that follows the pilot's phraseology\nto the initial communication. Our system mainly relies on open-source AI tools\nand air traffic control (ATC) databases, thus, proving its simplicity and ease\nof replicability. The overall pipeline is composed of the following: (1) a\nsubmodule that receives and pre-processes the input stream of raw audio, (2) an\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transforms audio into a sequence\nof words; (3) a high-level ATC-related entity parser, which extracts relevant\ninformation from the communication, i.e., callsigns and commands, and finally,\n(4) a speech synthesizer submodule that generates responses based on the\nhigh-level ATC entities previously extracted. Overall, we show that this system\ncould pave the way toward developing a real proof-of-concept pseudo-pilot\nsystem.

    "abstract": "Transaction fee markets are essential components of blockchain economies, as\nthey resolve the inherent scarcity in the number of transactions that can be\nadded to each block. In early blockchain protocols, this scarcity was resolved\nthrough a first-price auction in which users were forced to guess appropriate\nbids from recent blockchain data. Ethereum's EIP-1559 fee market reform\nstreamlines this process through the use of a base fee that is increased (or\ndecreased) whenever a block exceeds (or fails to meet) a specified target block\nsize. Previous work has found that the EIP-1559 mechanism may lead to a base\nfee process that is inherently chaotic, in which case the base fee does not\nconverge to a fixed point even under ideal conditions. However, the impact of\nthis chaotic behavior on the fee market's main design goal -- blocks whose\nlong-term average size equals the target -- has not previously been explored.\nAs our main contribution, we derive near-optimal upper and lower bounds for the\ntime-average block size in the EIP-1559 mechanism despite its possibly chaotic\nevolution. Our lower bound is equal to the target utilization level whereas our\nupper bound is approximately 6% higher than optimal. Empirical evidence is\nshown in great agreement with these theoretical predictions. Specifically, the\nhistorical average was approximately 2.9% larger than the target rage under\nProof-of-Work and decreased to approximately 2.0% after Ethereum's transition\nto Proof-of-Stake.

Initially focused on centralized aggregation, recent works in FL have\nemphasized greater decentralization to adapt to the highly heterogeneous\nnetwork edge. Among these, Hierarchical, Device-to-Device and Gossip Federated\nLearning (HFL, D2DFL \\& GFL respectively) can be considered as foundational FL\nalgorithms employing fundamental aggregation strategies. A number of FL\nalgorithms were subsequently proposed employing multiple fundamental\naggregation schemes jointly. Existing research, however, subjects the FL\nalgorithms to varied conditions and gauges the performance of these algorithms\nmainly against Federated Averaging (FedAvg) only. This work consolidates the FL\nlandscape and offers an objective analysis of the major FL algorithms through a\ncomprehensive cross-evaluation for a wide range of operating conditions. In\naddition to the three foundational FL algorithms, this work also analyzes six\nderived algorithms. To enable a uniform assessment, a multi-FL framework named\nFLAGS: Federated Learning AlGorithms Simulation has been developed for rapid\nconfiguration of multiple FL algorithms. Our experiments indicate that fully\ndecentralized FL algorithms achieve comparable accuracy under multiple\noperating conditions, including asynchronous aggregation and the presence of\nstragglers. Furthermore, decentralized FL can also operate in noisy\nenvironments and with a comparably higher local update rate. However, the\nimpact of extremely skewed data distributions on decentralized FL is much more\nadverse than on centralized variants.

    "title": "Robust Multitarget Tracking in Interference Environments: A  Message-Passing Approach",
    "abstract": "Multitarget tracking in the interference environments suffers from the\nnonuniform, unknown and time-varying clutter, resulting in dramatic performance\ndeterioration. We address this challenge by proposing a robust multitarget\ntracking algorithm, which estimates the states of clutter and targets\nsimultaneously by the message-passing (MP) approach. We define the\nnon-homogeneous clutter with a finite mixture model containing a uniform\ncomponent and multiple nonuniform components. The measured signal strength is\nutilized to estimate the mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of targets and the\nmean clutter-to-noise ratio (CNR) of clutter, which are then used as additional\nfeature information of targets and clutter to improve the performance of\ndiscrimination of targets from clutter. We also present a hybrid data\nassociation which can reason over correspondence between targets, clutter, and\nmeasurements. Then, a unified MP algorithm is used to infer the marginal\nposterior probability distributions of targets, clutter, and data association\nby splitting the joint probability distribution into a mean-field approximate\npart and a belief propagation part. As a result, a closed-loop iterative\noptimization of the posterior probability distribution can be obtained, which\ncan effectively deal with the coupling between target tracking, clutter\nestimation and data association. Simulation results demonstrate the performance\nsuperiority and robustness of the proposed multitarget tracking algorithm\ncompared with the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter and the\ncardinalized PHD (CPHD) filter.",

Existing research learns both tasks\nconcurrently utilizing a multi-task fusion technique but ignores the negative\ntransfer phenomenon induced by the unique textual style differences. Therefore,\ncontrastive learning based on the latent variable model is used to decouple the\nvarious textual genres in the latent space. We devise supervised and\nself-supervised positive and negative sample constructions for diverse\ndatasets. In addition, to capitalize on the style information contained in the\ndecoupled latent variables, we employ a style prefix that incorporates latent\nvariables further to control the generation of responses with varying styles.\nWe performed extensive experiments on three dialogue datasets, including a\nhybrid dialogue dataset and two task-oriented dialogue datasets.

    "abstract": "Being able to forecast the popularity of new garment designs is very\nimportant in an industry as fast paced as fashion, both in terms of\nprofitability and reducing the problem of unsold inventory. Here, we attempt to\naddress this task in order to provide informative forecasts to fashion\ndesigners within a virtual reality designer application that will allow them to\nfine tune their creations based on current consumer preferences within an\ninteractive and immersive environment. To achieve this we have to deal with the\nfollowing central challenges: (1) the proposed method should not hinder the\ncreative process and thus it has to rely only on the garment's visual\ncharacteristics, (2) the new garment lacks historical data from which to\nextrapolate their future popularity and (3) fashion trends in general are\nhighly dynamical. To this end, we develop a computer vision pipeline fine tuned\non fashion imagery in order to extract relevant visual features along with the\ncategory and attributes of the garment. We propose a hierarchical label sharing\n(HLS) pipeline for automatically capturing hierarchical relations among fashion\ncategories and attributes. Moreover, we propose MuQAR, a Multimodal\nQuasi-AutoRegressive neural network that forecasts the popularity of new\ngarments by combining their visual features and categorical features while an\nautoregressive neural network is modelling the popularity time series of the\ngarment's category and attributes.

    "abstract": "Static subword tokenization algorithms have been an essential component of\nrecent works on language modeling. However, their static nature results in\nimportant flaws that degrade the models' downstream performance and robustness.\nIn this work, we propose MANTa, a Module for Adaptive Neural TokenizAtion.\nMANTa is a differentiable tokenizer trained end-to-end with the language model.\nThe resulting system offers a trade-off between the expressiveness of\nbyte-level models and the speed of models trained using subword tokenization.\nIn addition, our tokenizer is highly explainable since it produces an explicit\nsegmentation of sequences into blocks. We evaluate our pre-trained model on\nseveral English datasets from different domains as well as on synthetic noise.\nWe find that MANTa improves robustness to character perturbations and\nout-of-domain data. We then show that MANTa performs comparably to other models\non the general-domain GLUE benchmark. Finally, we show that it is considerably\nfaster than strictly byte-level models.",

    "abstract": "Although DETR-based 3D detectors can simplify the detection pipeline and\nachieve direct sparse predictions, their performance still lags behind dense\ndetectors with post-processing for 3D object detection from point clouds. DETRs\nusually adopt a larger number of queries than GTs (e.g., 300 queries v.s. 40\nobjects in Waymo) in a scene, which inevitably incur many false positives\nduring inference. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective sparse 3D\ndetector, named Query Contrast Voxel-DETR (ConQueR), to eliminate the\nchallenging false positives, and achieve more accurate and sparser predictions.\nWe observe that most false positives are highly overlapping in local regions,\ncaused by the lack of explicit supervision to discriminate locally similar\nqueries. We thus propose a Query Contrast mechanism to explicitly enhance\nqueries towards their best-matched GTs over all unmatched query predictions.\nThis is achieved by the construction of positive and negative GT-query pairs\nfor each GT, and a contrastive loss to enhance positive GT-query pairs against\nnegative ones based on feature similarities. ConQueR closes the gap of sparse\nand dense 3D detectors, and reduces up to ~60% false positives. Our\nsingle-frame ConQueR achieves new state-of-the-art (sota) 71.6 mAPH/L2 on the\nchallenging Waymo Open Dataset validation set, outperforming previous sota\nmethods (e.g., PV-RCNN++) by over 2.0 mAPH/L2.",

It can save the cost of manually labeling data in real-world applications\nsuch as robot vision and autonomous driving. Traditional UDA often assumes that\nthere are abundant unlabeled real-world data samples available during training\nfor the adaptation. However, such an assumption does not always hold in\npractice owing to the collection difficulty and the scarcity of the data. Thus,\nwe aim to relieve this need on a large number of real data, and explore the\none-shot unsupervised sim-to-real domain adaptation (OSUDA) and generalization\n(OSDG) problem, where only one real-world data sample is available.

    "abstract": "Equipping predicted segmentation with calibrated uncertainty is essential for\nsafety-critical applications. In this work, we focus on capturing the\ndata-inherent uncertainty (aka aleatoric uncertainty) in segmentation,\ntypically when ambiguities exist in input images. Due to the high-dimensional\noutput space and potential multiple modes in segmenting ambiguous images, it\nremains challenging to predict well-calibrated uncertainty for segmentation. To\ntackle this problem, we propose a novel mixture of stochastic experts (MoSE)\nmodel, where each expert network estimates a distinct mode of the aleatoric\nuncertainty and a gating network predicts the probabilities of an input image\nbeing segmented in those modes. This yields an efficient two-level uncertainty\nrepresentation. To learn the model, we develop a Wasserstein-like loss that\ndirectly minimizes the distribution distance between the MoSE and ground truth\nannotations. The loss can easily integrate traditional segmentation quality\nmeasures and be efficiently optimized via constraint relaxation. We validate\nour method on the LIDC-IDRI dataset and a modified multimodal Cityscapes\ndataset.

    "abstract": "The recurrent structure is a prevalent framework for the task of video\nsuper-resolution, which models the temporal dependency between frames via\nhidden states. When applied to real-world scenarios with unknown and complex\ndegradations, hidden states tend to contain unpleasant artifacts and propagate\nthem to restored frames. In this circumstance, our analyses show that such\nartifacts can be largely alleviated when the hidden state is replaced with a\ncleaner counterpart. Based on the observations, we propose a Hidden State\nAttention (HSA) module to mitigate artifacts in real-world video\nsuper-resolution. Specifically, we first adopt various cheap filters to produce\na hidden state pool. For example, Gaussian blur filters are for smoothing\nartifacts while sharpening filters are for enhancing details. To aggregate a\nnew hidden state that contains fewer artifacts from the hidden state pool, we\ndevise a Selective Cross Attention (SCA) module, in which the attention between\ninput features and each hidden state is calculated. Equipped with HSA, our\nproposed method, namely FastRealVSR, is able to achieve 2x speedup while\nobtaining better performance than Real-BasicVSR.

The latest VR devices are also\nequipped with integrated eye-tracking, which constitutes an exceptional\nopportunity for monitoring users' workload online. However, such devices are\nfairly recent, and human factors have been consistently marginalized so far in\ntelerobotics research. We thus covered these aspects by analyzing extensive\nbehavioral data generated by 24 participants driving a simulated industrial\nrobot in VR through a pick-and-place task. Users drove the robot via\nbutton-based and action-based controls and under low (single-task) and high\n(dual-task) mental demands. We collected self-reports, performance and\neye-tracking data.

Users performed faster and more accurately, while\nalso showing a lower mental workload, when using an action-based VR control.\nAmong the eye parameters, pupil size was the most resilient indicator of\nworkload, as it was highly correlated with the self-reports and was not\naffected by the user's degree of physical motion in VR.

    "abstract": "Does the dominant approach to learn representations (as a side effect of\noptimizing an expected cost for a single training distribution) remain a good\napproach when we are dealing with multiple distributions. Our thesis is that\nsuch scenarios are better served by representations that are \"richer\" than\nthose obtained with a single optimization episode. This is supported by a\ncollection of empirical results obtained with an apparently na\\\"ive ensembling\ntechnique: concatenating the representations obtained with multiple training\nepisodes using the same data, model, algorithm, and hyper-parameters, but\ndifferent random seeds. These independently trained networks perform similarly.\nYet, in a number of scenarios involving new distributions, the concatenated\nrepresentation performs substantially better than an equivalently sized network\ntrained from scratch. This proves that the representations constructed by\nmultiple training episodes are in fact different. Although their concatenation\ncarries little additional information about the training task under the\ntraining distribution, it becomes substantially more informative when tasks or\ndistributions change. Meanwhile, a single training episode is unlikely to yield\nsuch a redundant representation because the optimization process has no reason\nto accumulate features that do not incrementally improve the training\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Event cameras are emerging vision sensors and their advantages are suitable\nfor various applications such as autonomous robots. Contrast maximization\n(CMax), which provides state-of-the-art accuracy on motion estimation using\nevents, may suffer from an overfitting problem called event collapse. Prior\nworks are computationally expensive or cannot alleviate the overfitting, which\nundermines the benefits of the CMax framework. We propose a novel,\ncomputationally efficient regularizer based on geometric principles to mitigate\nevent collapse.

    "abstract": "Koopman operators model nonlinear dynamics as a linear dynamic system acting\non a nonlinear function as the state. This nonstandard state is often called a\nKoopman observable and is usually approximated numerically by a superposition\nof functions drawn from a dictionary. In a widely used algorithm, Extended\nDynamic Mode Decomposition, the dictionary functions are drawn from a fixed\nclass of functions. Recently, deep learning combined with EDMD has been used to\nlearn novel dictionary functions in an algorithm called deep dynamic mode\ndecomposition (deepDMD). The learned representation both (1) accurately models\nand (2) scales well with the dimension of the original nonlinear system. In\nthis paper we analyze the learned dictionaries from deepDMD and explore the\ntheoretical basis for their strong performance. We explore State-Inclusive\nLogistic Lifting (SILL) dictionary functions to approximate Koopman\nobservables. Error analysis of these dictionary functions show they satisfy a\nproperty of subspace approximation, which we define as uniform finite\napproximate closure. Our results provide a hypothesis to explain the success of\ndeep neural networks in learning numerical approximations to Koopman operators.\nPart 2 of this paper will extend this explanation by demonstrating the subspace\ninvariant of heterogeneous dictionaries and presenting a head-to-head numerical\ncomparison of deepDMD and low-parameter heterogeneous dictionary learning.",

    "abstract": "Recent neural compression methods have been based on the popular hyperprior\nframework. It relies on Scalar Quantization and offers a very strong\ncompression performance. This contrasts from recent advances in image\ngeneration and representation learning, where Vector Quantization is more\ncommonly employed. In this work, we attempt to bring these lines of research\ncloser by revisiting vector quantization for image compression. We build upon\nthe VQ-VAE framework and introduce several modifications. First, we replace the\nvanilla vector quantizer by a product quantizer. This intermediate solution\nbetween vector and scalar quantization allows for a much wider set of\nrate-distortion points: It implicitly defines high-quality quantizers that\nwould otherwise require intractably large codebooks. Second, inspired by the\nsuccess of Masked Image Modeling (MIM) in the context of self-supervised\nlearning and generative image models, we propose a novel conditional entropy\nmodel which improves entropy coding by modelling the co-dependencies of the\nquantized latent codes. The resulting PQ-MIM model is surprisingly effective:\nits compression performance on par with recent hyperprior methods. It also\noutperforms HiFiC in terms of FID and KID metrics when optimized with\nperceptual losses (e.g. adversarial). Finally, since PQ-MIM is compatible with\nimage generation frameworks, we show qualitatively that it can operate under a\nhybrid mode between compression and generation, with no further training or\nfinetuning. As a result, we explore the extreme compression regime where an\nimage is compressed into 200 bytes, i.e., less than a tweet.",

This is\nmainly due to the technologies supporting Web3: blockchain, IPFS, and libp2p,\nthat although provide a good collection of tools to develop Web3 applications,\nare still limited in terms of design and performance. This motivates the need\nto better understand these technologies as to enable novel optimizations that\ncan push Web3 to its full potential. Unfortunately, understanding the current\nbehavior of a fully decentralized large-scale distributed system is a difficult\ntask, as there is no centralized authority that has full knowledge of the\nsystem operation.\nTo this end, in this paper we characterize the workload of IPFS, a key\nenabler of Web3. To achieve this, we have collected traces from accesses\nperformed by users to one of the most popular IPFS gateways located in North\nAmerica for a period of two weeks. Through the fine analysis of these traces,\nwe gathered the amount of requests to the system, and found the providers of\nthe requested content. With this data, we characterize both the popularity of\nrequested and provided content, as well as their geo-location (by matching IP\naddress with the MaxMind database). Our results show that most of the requests\nin IPFS are only to a few different content, that is provided by large portion\nof peers in the system. Furthermore, our analysis also shows that most requests\nare provided by the two largest portions of providers in the system, located in\nNorth America and Europe.

    "abstract": "Quantifying motion in 3D is important for studying the behavior of humans and\nother animals, but manual pose annotations are expensive and time-consuming to\nobtain. Self-supervised keypoint discovery is a promising strategy for\nestimating 3D poses without annotations. However, current keypoint discovery\napproaches commonly process single 2D views and do not operate in the 3D space.\nWe propose a new method to perform self-supervised keypoint discovery in 3D\nfrom multi-view videos of behaving agents, without any keypoint or bounding box\nsupervision in 2D or 3D. Our method uses an encoder-decoder architecture with a\n3D volumetric heatmap, trained to reconstruct spatiotemporal differences across\nmultiple views, in addition to joint length constraints on a learned 3D\nskeleton of the subject. In this way, we discover keypoints without requiring\nmanual supervision in videos of humans and rats, demonstrating the potential of\n3D keypoint discovery for studying behavior.",

    "abstract": "We propose an approach for semantic imitation, which uses demonstrations from\na source domain, e.g. human videos, to accelerate reinforcement learning (RL)\nin a different target domain, e.g. a robotic manipulator in a simulated\nkitchen. Instead of imitating low-level actions like joint velocities, our\napproach imitates the sequence of demonstrated semantic skills like \"opening\nthe microwave\" or \"turning on the stove\". This allows us to transfer\ndemonstrations across environments (e.g. real-world to simulated kitchen) and\nagent embodiments (e.g. bimanual human demonstration to robotic arm). We\nevaluate on three challenging cross-domain learning problems and match the\nperformance of demonstration-accelerated RL approaches that require in-domain\ndemonstrations. In a simulated kitchen environment, our approach learns\nlong-horizon robot manipulation tasks, using less than 3 minutes of human video\ndemonstrations from a real-world kitchen. This enables scaling robot learning\nvia the reuse of demonstrations, e.g. collected as human videos, for learning\nin any number of target domains.",

    "abstract": "StyleGAN has achieved great progress in 2D face reconstruction and semantic\nediting via image inversion and latent editing. While studies over extending 2D\nStyleGAN to 3D faces have emerged, a corresponding generic 3D GAN inversion\nframework is still missing, limiting the applications of 3D face reconstruction\nand semantic editing. In this paper, we study the challenging problem of 3D GAN\ninversion where a latent code is predicted given a single face image to\nfaithfully recover its 3D shapes and detailed textures. The problem is\nill-posed: innumerable compositions of shape and texture could be rendered to\nthe current image. Furthermore, with the limited capacity of a global latent\ncode, 2D inversion methods cannot preserve faithful shape and texture at the\nsame time when applied to 3D models. To solve this problem, we devise an\neffective self-training scheme to constrain the learning of inversion. The\nlearning is done efficiently without any real-world 2D-3D training pairs but\nproxy samples generated from a 3D GAN. In addition, apart from a global latent\ncode that captures the coarse shape and texture information, we augment the\ngeneration network with a local branch, where pixel-aligned features are added\nto faithfully reconstruct face details. We further consider a new pipeline to\nperform 3D view-consistent editing. Extensive experiments show that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art inversion methods in both shape and texture\nreconstruction quality. Code and data will be released.",

Second, by\nincorporating the temporal shift module (TSM), originally designed for video\nunderstanding, into the discriminator, we manage to advance the generator in\nsynthesizing more consistent dynamics. Third, we develop a novel B-Spline based\nmotion representation to ensure temporal smoothness to achieve infinite-length\nvideo generation. It can go beyond the frame number used in training.

To cope with statistical heterogeneity in the federated setting\nacross clients which can significantly degrade the learning performance, we use\na distributed dynamic weighting approach.

    "abstract": "The combination of artist-curated scans, and deep implicit functions (IF), is\nenabling the creation of detailed, clothed, 3D humans from images. However,\nexisting methods are far from perfect. IF-based methods recover free-form\ngeometry but produce disembodied limbs or degenerate shapes for unseen poses or\nclothes. To increase robustness for these cases, existing work uses an explicit\nparametric body model to constrain surface reconstruction, but this limits the\nrecovery of free-form surfaces such as loose clothing that deviates from the\nbody. What we want is a method that combines the best properties of implicit\nand explicit methods. To this end, we make two key observations: (1) current\nnetworks are better at inferring detailed 2D maps than full-3D surfaces, and\n(2) a parametric model can be seen as a \"canvas\" for stitching together\ndetailed surface patches. ECON infers high-fidelity 3D humans even in loose\nclothes and challenging poses, while having realistic faces and fingers. This\ngoes beyond previous methods. Quantitative, evaluation of the CAPE and\nRenderpeople datasets shows that ECON is more accurate than the state of the\nart.

Materials and Methods: For this\nretrospective study, we collected 3,166 three-dimensional (3D) double-echo\nsteady-state magnetic resonance (MR) images from the Osteoarthritis Initiative\ndataset and 50 3D turbo/fast spin-echo MR images from our institute (in 2020\nand 2021) as the source and target datasets, respectively.

The\nproposed UDA pipeline included (a) pre-processing, which involved automatic\nsegmentation and region-of-interest cropping; (b) source classifier training,\nwhich involved pre-training phenotype classifiers on the source dataset; (c)\ntarget encoder adaptation, which involved unsupervised adaption of the source\nencoder to the target encoder and (d) target classifier validation, which\ninvolved statistical analysis of the target classification performance\nevaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\n(AUROC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

We\nstate the Discontinuous Finite Element Stokes-Dirac structure with a power\npreserving coupling between elements, which provides the mathematical framework\nfor a large class of pH discontinuous Galerkin discretizations. We also provide\nan a priori error analysis for the port-Hamiltonian discontinuous Galerkin\nFinite Element Method (pH-DGFEM). The port-Hamiltonian discontinuous Galerkin\nfinite element method is demonstrated for the scalar wave equation showing\noptimal rates of convergence.",

Although SpO2\nis usually measured using a pulse oximeter, non-contact SpO2 estimation methods\nfrom facial or hand videos have been attracting attention in recent years. In\nthis paper, we propose an SpO2 estimation method from facial videos based on\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN). Our method constructs CNN models that\nconsider the direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) components\nextracted from the RGB signals of facial videos, which are important in the\nprinciple of SpO2 estimation. Specifically, we extract the DC and AC components\nfrom the spatio-temporal map using filtering processes and train CNN models to\npredict SpO2 from these components. We also propose an end-to-end model that\npredicts SpO2 directly from the spatio-temporal map by extracting the DC and AC\ncomponents via convolutional layers. Experiments using facial videos and SpO2\ndata from 50 subjects demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a better\nestimation performance than current state-of-the-art SpO2 estimation methods.",

To address\nthese issues, we propose M-GenSeg, a new semi-supervised training strategy for\naccurate cross-modality tumor segmentation on unpaired bi-modal datasets. Based\non image-level labels, a first unsupervised objective encourages the model to\nperform diseased to healthy translation by disentangling tumors from the\nbackground, which encompasses the segmentation task.

    "abstract": "Emulating the human ability to solve the cocktail party problem, i.e., focus\non a source of interest in a complex acoustic scene, is a long standing goal of\naudio source separation research. Much of this research investigates separating\nspeech from noise, speech from speech, musical instruments from each other, or\nsound events from each other. In this paper, we focus on the cocktail fork\nproblem, which takes a three-pronged approach to source separation by\nseparating an audio mixture such as a movie soundtrack or podcast into the\nthree broad categories of speech, music, and sound effects (SFX - understood to\ninclude ambient noise and natural sound events). We benchmark the performance\nof several deep learning-based source separation models on this task and\nevaluate them with respect to simple objective measures such as\nsignal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) as well as objective metrics that better\ncorrelate with human perception. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate how source\nseparation can influence downstream transcription tasks. First, we investigate\nthe task of activity detection on the three sources as a way to both further\nimprove source separation and perform transcription. We formulate the\ntranscription tasks as speech recognition for speech and audio tagging for\nmusic and SFX. We observe that, while the use of source separation estimates\nimproves transcription performance in comparison to the original soundtrack,\nperformance is still sub-optimal due to artifacts introduced by the separation\nprocess. Therefore, we thoroughly investigate how remixing of the three\nseparated source stems at various relative levels can reduce artifacts and\nconsequently improve the transcription performance. We find that remixing music\nand SFX interferences at a target SNR of 17.5 dB reduces speech recognition\nword error rate, and similar impact from remixing is observed for tagging music\nand SFX content.",

To systematically address\nthis fundamental problem, we pose it as a signal reconstruction problem where\nwe have lost correspondences between the samples and their respective channels.\nWe show that under the assumption that the signals of interest admit a sparse\nrepresentation over an overcomplete dictionary, unique signal recovery is\npossible.

    "abstract": "Independence testing is a fundamental and classical statistical problem that\nhas been extensively studied in the batch setting when one fixes the sample\nsize before collecting data. However, practitioners often prefer procedures\nthat adapt to the complexity of a problem at hand instead of setting sample\nsize in advance. Ideally, such procedures should (a) allow stopping earlier on\neasy tasks (and later on harder tasks), hence making better use of available\nresources, and (b) continuously monitor the data and efficiently incorporate\nstatistical evidence after collecting new data, while controlling the false\nalarm rate. It is well known that classical batch tests are not tailored for\nstreaming data settings, since valid inference after data peeking requires\ncorrecting for multiple testing, but such corrections generally result in low\npower. In this paper, we design sequential kernelized independence tests\n(SKITs) that overcome such shortcomings based on the principle of testing by\nbetting. We exemplify our broad framework using bets inspired by kernelized\ndependence measures such as the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC)\nand the constrained-covariance criterion (COCO). Importantly, we also\ngeneralize the framework to non-i.i.d. time-varying settings, for which there\nexist no batch tests. We demonstrate the power of our approaches on both\nsimulated and real data.",

    "abstract": "In this thesis, we consider two simple but typical control problems and apply\ndeep reinforcement learning to them, i.e., to cool and control a particle which\nis subject to continuous position measurement in a one-dimensional quadratic\npotential or in a quartic potential. We compare the performance of\nreinforcement learning control and conventional control strategies on the two\nproblems, and show that the reinforcement learning achieves a performance\ncomparable to the optimal control for the quadratic case, and outperforms\nconventional control strategies for the quartic case for which the optimal\ncontrol strategy is unknown. To our knowledge, this is the first time deep\nreinforcement learning is applied to quantum control problems in continuous\nreal space. Our research demonstrates that deep reinforcement learning can be\nused to control a stochastic quantum system in real space effectively as a\nmeasurement-feedback closed-loop controller, and our research also shows the\nability of AI to discover new control strategies and properties of the quantum\nsystems that are not well understood, and we can gain insights into these\nproblems by learning from the AI, which opens up a new regime for scientific\nresearch.",

    "abstract": "We deal with Mckean-Vlasov and Boltzmann type jump equations. This means that\nthe coefficients of the stochastic equation depend on the law of the solution,\nand the equation is driven by a Poisson point measure with intensity measure\nwhich depends on the law of the solution as well. In [3], Alfonsi and Bally\nhave proved that under some suitable conditions, the solution $X_t$ of such\nequation exists and is unique. One also proves that $X_t$ is the probabilistic\ninterpretation of an analytical weak equation. Moreover, the Euler scheme\n$X_t^{\\mathcal{P}}$ of this equation converges to $X_t$ in Wasserstein\ndistance. In this paper, under more restricted assumptions, we show that the\nEuler scheme $X_t^{\\mathcal{P}}$ converges to $X_t$ in total variation distance\nand $X_t$ has a smooth density (which is a function solution of the analytical\nweak equation). On the other hand, in view of simulation, we use a truncated\nEuler scheme $X^{\\mathcal{P},M}_t$ which has a finite numbers of jumps in any\ncompact interval. We prove that $X^{\\mathcal{P},M}_{t}$ also converges to $X_t$\nin total variation distance. Finally, we give an algorithm based on a particle\nsystem associated to $X^{\\mathcal{P},M}_t$ in order to approximate the density\nof the law of $X_t$. Complete estimates of the error are obtained.",
