    "abstract": "Implementing and executing numerical algorithms to solve fractional\ndifferential equations has been less straightforward than using their\ninteger-order counterparts, posing challenges for practitioners who wish to\nincorporate fractional calculus in applied case studies. Hence, we created an\nopen-source Julia package, FdeSolver, that provides numerical solutions for\nfractional-order differential equations based on product-integration rules,\npredictor-corrector algorithms, and the Newton-Raphson method. The package\ncovers solutions for one-dimensional equations with orders of positive real\nnumbers. For high-dimensional systems, the orders of positive real numbers are\nlimited to less than (and equal to) one. Incommensurate derivatives are allowed\nand defined in the Caputo sense. Here, we summarize the implementation for a\nrepresentative class of problems, provide comparisons with available\nalternatives in Julia and Matlab, describe our adherence to good practices in\nopen research software development, and demonstrate the practical performance\nof the methods in two applications; we show how to simulate microbial community\ndynamics and model the spread of Covid-19 by fitting the order of derivatives\nbased on epidemiological observations. Overall, these results highlight the\nefficiency, reliability, and practicality of the FdeSolver Julia package.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers have shown great promise recently for many vision tasks\ndue to the insightful architecture design and attention mechanism. By\nrevisiting the self-attention responses in Transformers, we empirically observe\ntwo interesting issues. First, Vision Transformers present a queryirrelevant\nbehavior at deep layers, where the attention maps exhibit nearly consistent\ncontexts in global scope, regardless of the query patch position (also\nhead-irrelevant). Second, the attention maps are intrinsically sparse, few\ntokens dominate the attention weights; introducing the knowledge from ConvNets\nwould largely smooth the attention and enhance the performance. Motivated by\nabove observations, we generalize self-attention formulation to abstract a\nqueryirrelevant global context directly and further integrate the global\ncontext into convolutions. The resulting model, a Fully Convolutional Vision\nTransformer (i.e., FCViT), purely consists of convolutional layers and firmly\ninherits the merits of both attention mechanism and convolutions, including\ndynamic property, weight sharing, and short- and long-range feature modeling,\netc. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FCViT. With less\nthan 14M parameters, our FCViT-S12 outperforms related work ResT-Lite by 3.7%\ntop1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. When scaling FCViT to larger models, we still\nperform better than previous state-of-the-art ConvNeXt with even fewer\nparameters. FCViT-based models also demonstrate promising transferability to\ndownstream tasks, like object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic\nsegmentation.

    "abstract": "We propose a learning-based methodology to reconstruct private information\nheld by a population of interacting agents in order to predict an exact outcome\nof the underlying multi-agent interaction process, here identified as a\nstationary action profile. We envision a scenario where an external observer,\nendowed with a learning procedure, is allowed to make queries and observe the\nagents' reactions through private action-reaction mappings, whose collective\nfixed point corresponds to a stationary profile. By adopting a smart query\nprocess to iteratively collect sensible data and update parametric estimates,\nwe establish sufficient conditions to assess the asymptotic properties of the\nproposed learning-based methodology so that, if convergence happens, it can\nonly be towards a stationary action profile. This fact yields two main\nconsequences: i) learning locally-exact surrogates of the action-reaction\nmappings allows the external observer to succeed in its prediction task, and\nii) working with assumptions so general that a stationary profile is not even\nguaranteed to exist, the established sufficient conditions hence act also as\ncertificates for the existence of such a desirable profile.

    "abstract": "Over 500 million tweets are posted in Twitter each day, out of which about\n11% tweets are deleted by the users posting them. This phenomenon of widespread\ndeletion of tweets leads to a number of questions: what kind of content posted\nby users makes them want to delete them later? %Are all users equally active in\ndeleting their tweets or Are users of certain predispositions more likely to\npost regrettable tweets, deleting them later? In this paper we provide a\ndetailed characterization of tweets posted and then later deleted by their\nauthors. We collected tweets from over 200 thousand Twitter users during a\nperiod of four weeks. Our characterization shows significant personality\ndifferences between users who delete their tweets and those who do not. We find\nthat users who delete their tweets are more likely to be extroverted and\nneurotic while being less conscientious. Also, we find that deleted tweets\nwhile containing less information and being less conversational, contain\nsignificant indications of regrettable content. Since users of online\ncommunication do not have instant social cues (like listener's body language)\nto gauge the impact of their words, they are often delayed in employing repair\nstrategies. Finally, we build a classifier which takes textual, contextual, as\nwell as user features to predict if a tweet will be deleted or not. The\nclassifier achieves a F1-score of 0.78 and the precision increases when we\nconsider response features of the tweets.",

The key ideas of our Mantis\ninclude the optimization of SNN operations, the employment of a bio-plausible\nonline learning mechanism, and the SNN model selection. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that our methodology maintains high accuracy with a\nsignificantly smaller memory footprint and energy consumption (i.e., 3.32x\nmemory reduction and 2.9x energy saving for an SNN model with 8-bit weights)\ncompared to the baseline network with 32-bit weights. In this manner, our\nMantis enables the employment of SNNs for resource- and energy-constrained\nmobile agents.",

    "title": "Nothing Stands Alone: Relational Fake News Detection with Hypergraph  Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, fake news easily propagates through online social networks and\nbecomes a grand threat to individuals and society. Assessing the authenticity\nof news is challenging due to its elaborately fabricated contents, making it\ndifficult to obtain large-scale annotations for fake news data. Due to such\ndata scarcity issues, detecting fake news tends to fail and overfit in the\nsupervised setting. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been adopted to\nleverage the richer relational information among both labeled and unlabeled\ninstances. Despite their promising results, they are inherently focused on\npairwise relations between news, which can limit the expressive power for\ncapturing fake news that spreads in a group-level. For example, detecting fake\nnews can be more effective when we better understand relations between news\npieces shared among susceptible users. To address those issues, we propose to\nleverage a hypergraph to represent group-wise interaction among news, while\nfocusing on important news relations with its dual-level attention mechanism.\nExperiments based on two benchmark datasets show that our approach yields\nremarkable performance and maintains the high performance even with a small\nsubset of labeled news data.",

    "abstract": "In order for artificial neural networks to begin accurately mimicking\nbiological ones, they must be able to adapt to new exigencies without\nforgetting what they have learned from previous training. Lifelong learning\napproaches to artificial neural networks attempt to strive towards this goal,\nyet have not progressed far enough to be realistically deployed for natural\nlanguage processing tasks. The proverbial roadblock of catastrophic forgetting\nstill gate-keeps researchers from an adequate lifelong learning model. While\nefforts are being made to quell catastrophic forgetting, there is a lack of\nresearch that looks into the importance of class ordering when training on new\nclasses for incremental learning. This is surprising as the ordering of\n\"classes\" that humans learn is heavily monitored and incredibly important.\nWhile heuristics to develop an ideal class order have been researched, this\npaper examines class ordering as it relates to priming as a scheme for\nincremental class learning. By examining the connections between various\nmethods of priming found in humans and how those are mimicked yet remain\nunexplained in life-long machine learning, this paper provides a better\nunderstanding of the similarities between our biological systems and the\nsynthetic systems while simultaneously improving current practices to combat\ncatastrophic forgetting.

A promising hardening scheme is to wrap applications in\nhardware transactions, enabled by Intel TSX, that return control to the\nsoftware upon unexpected cache misses and interruptions so that the existing\nside-channel attacks exploiting these micro-architectural events can be\ndetected and mitigated. However, existing hardening schemes scale only to\nsmall-data computation, with a typical working set smaller than one or few\ntimes (e.g., $8$ times) of a CPU data cache.\nThis work tackles the data scalability and performance efficiency of security\nhardening schemes of Intel SGX enclaves against memory-access pattern side\nchannels. The key insight is that the size of TSX transactions in the target\ncomputation is critical, both performance- and security-wise. Unlike the\nexisting designs, this work dynamically partitions target computations to\nenlarge transactions while avoiding aborts, leading to lower performance\noverhead and improved side-channel security. We materialize the dynamic\npartitioning scheme and build a C++ library to monitor and model cache\nutilization at runtime.

    "abstract": "A major concern in modern power systems is that the popularity and\nfluctuating characteristics of renewable energy may cause more and more\ntransmission congestion events. Traditional congestion management modeling\ninvolves AC or DC power flow equations, while the former equation always\naccompanies great amount of computation, and the latter cannot consider voltage\namplitude and reactive power. Therefore, this paper proposes a congestion\nmanagement approach incorporating a specially-designed generalized generator\nshift distribution factor (GSDF) to derive a computationally-efficient and\naccurate management strategies. This congestion management strategy involves\nmultiple balancing generators for generation shift operation. The proposed\nmodel is superior in a low computational complexity (linear equation) and\nversatile modeling representation with full consideration of voltage amplitude\nand reactive power.",

    "abstract": "Our situated environment is full of uncertainty and highly dynamic, thus\nhindering the widespread adoption of machine-led Intelligent Decision-Making\n(IDM) in real world scenarios. This means IDM should have the capability of\ncontinuously learning new skills and efficiently generalizing across wider\napplications. IDM benefits from any new approaches and theoretical\nbreakthroughs that exhibit Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) breaking the\nbarriers between tasks and applications. Recent research has well-examined\nneural architecture, Transformer, as a backbone foundation model and its\ngeneralization to various tasks, including computer vision, natural language\nprocessing, and reinforcement learning. We therefore argue that a foundation\ndecision model (FDM) can be established by formulating various decision-making\ntasks as a sequence decoding task using the Transformer architecture; this\nwould be a promising solution to advance the applications of IDM in more\ncomplex real world tasks. In this paper, we elaborate on how a foundation\ndecision model improves the efficiency and generalization of IDM. We also\ndiscuss potential applications of a FDM in multi-agent game AI, production\nscheduling, and robotics tasks. Finally, through a case study, we demonstrate\nour realization of the FDM, DigitalBrain (DB1) with 1.2 billion parameters,\nwhich achieves human-level performance over 453 tasks, including text\ngeneration, images caption, video games playing, robotic control, and traveling\nsalesman problems.

Detailed analysis of multirate closed-loop systems, zeros and poles are\ngiven, which gives rise to tracking or rejection conditions.

Each user in the system can access a unique set of\n$r<C$ caches, and there exist users corresponding to every distinct set of $r$\ncaches. Therefore, the number of users in the system is $\\binom{C}{r}$. For the\naforementioned combinatorial multi-access setting, we propose a coded caching\nscheme with an MDS code-based coded placement. This novel placement technique\nhelps to achieve a better rate in the delivery phase compared to the optimal\nscheme under uncoded placement, when $M> N/C$. For a lower memory regime, we\npresent another scheme with coded placement, which outperforms the optimal\nscheme under uncoded placement if the number of files is no more than the\nnumber of users. Further, we derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the\noptimal rate-memory trade-off of the combinatorial multi-access coded caching\nscheme.

In particular, given a discrete\ntrial space, the optimal test space induces a numerical scheme delivering the\nbest approximation in terms of a problem-dependent energy norm. This ideal\napproach has two shortcomings: first, we need to explicitly know the set of\noptimal test functions; and second, the optimal test functions may have large\nsupports inducing expensive dense linear systems. Nevertheless, parametric\nfamilies of PDEs are an example where it is worth investing some (offline)\ncomputational effort to obtain stabilized linear systems that can be solved\nefficiently, for a given set of parameters, in an online stage. Therefore, as a\nremedy for the first shortcoming, we explicitly compute (offline) a function\nmapping any PDE-parameter, to the matrix of coefficients of optimal test\nfunctions (in a basis expansion) associated with that PDE-parameter. Next, as a\nremedy for the second shortcoming, we use the low-rank approximation to\nhierarchically compress the (non-square) matrix of coefficients of optimal test\nfunctions. In order to accelerate this process, we train a neural network to\nlearn a critical bottleneck of the compression algorithm (for a given set of\nPDE-parameters).

    "abstract": "An oft-cited open problem of federated learning is the existence of data\nheterogeneity at the clients. One pathway to understanding the drastic accuracy\ndrop in federated learning is by scrutinizing the behavior of the clients' deep\nmodels on data with different levels of \"difficulty\", which has been left\nunaddressed. In this paper, we investigate a different and rarely studied\ndimension of FL: ordered learning. Specifically, we aim to investigate how\nordered learning principles can contribute to alleviating the heterogeneity\neffects in FL. We present theoretical analysis and conduct extensive empirical\nstudies on the efficacy of orderings spanning three kinds of learning:\ncurriculum, anti-curriculum, and random curriculum. We find that curriculum\nlearning largely alleviates non-IIDness. Interestingly, the more disparate the\ndata distributions across clients the more they benefit from ordered learning.\nWe provide analysis explaining this phenomenon, specifically indicating how\ncurriculum training appears to make the objective landscape progressively less\nconvex, suggesting fast converging iterations at the beginning of the training\nprocedure. We derive quantitative results of convergence for both convex and\nnonconvex objectives by modeling the curriculum training on federated devices\nas local SGD with locally biased stochastic gradients. Also, inspired by\nordered learning, we propose a novel client selection technique that benefits\nfrom the real-world disparity in the clients. Our proposed approach to client\nselection has a synergic effect when applied together with ordered learning in\nFL.",

    "abstract": "Name ambiguity is common in academic digital libraries, such as multiple\nauthors having the same name. This creates challenges for academic data\nmanagement and analysis, thus name disambiguation becomes necessary. The\nprocedure of name disambiguation is to divide publications with the same name\ninto different groups, each group belonging to a unique author. A large amount\nof attribute information in publications makes traditional methods fall into\nthe quagmire of feature selection. These methods always select attributes\nartificially and equally, which usually causes a negative impact on accuracy.\nThe proposed method is mainly based on representation learning for\nheterogeneous networks and clustering and exploits the self-attention\ntechnology to solve the problem. The presentation of publications is a\nsynthesis of structural and semantic representations. The structural\nrepresentation is obtained by meta-path-based sampling and a skip-gram-based\nembedding method, and meta-path level attention is introduced to automatically\nlearn the weight of each feature. The semantic representation is generated\nusing NLP tools. Our proposal performs better in terms of name disambiguation\naccuracy compared with baselines and the ablation experiments demonstrate the\nimprovement by feature selection and the meta-path level attention in our\nmethod. The experimental results show the superiority of our new method for\ncapturing the most attributes from publications and reducing the impact of\nredundant information.",

    "abstract": "Heating in private households is a major contributor to the emissions\ngenerated today. Heat pumps are a promising alternative for heat generation and\nare a key technology in achieving our goals of the German energy transformation\nand to become less dependent on fossil fuels. Today, the majority of heat pumps\nin the field are controlled by a simple heating curve, which is a naive mapping\nof the current outdoor temperature to a control action. A more advanced control\napproach is model predictive control (MPC) which was applied in multiple\nresearch works to heat pump control. However, MPC is heavily dependent on the\nbuilding model, which has several disadvantages. Motivated by this and by\nrecent breakthroughs in the field, this work applies deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) to heat pump control in a simulated environment. Through a\ncomparison to MPC, it could be shown that it is possible to apply DRL in a\nmodel-free manner to achieve MPC-like performance. This work extends other\nworks which have already applied DRL to building heating operation by\nperforming an in-depth analysis of the learned control strategies and by giving\na detailed comparison of the two state-of-the-art control methods.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous robotic surgery has advanced significantly based on analysis of\nvisual and temporal cues in surgical workflow, but relational cues from domain\nknowledge remain under investigation. Complex relations in surgical annotations\ncan be divided into intra- and inter-relations, both valuable to autonomous\nsystems to comprehend surgical workflows. Intra- and inter-relations describe\nthe relevance of various categories within a particular annotation type and the\nrelevance of different annotation types, respectively. This paper aims to\nsystematically investigate the importance of relational cues in surgery. First,\nwe contribute the RLLS12M dataset, a large-scale collection of robotic left\nlateral sectionectomy (RLLS), by curating 50 videos of 50 patients operated by\n5 surgeons and annotating a hierarchical workflow, which consists of 3 inter-\nand 6 intra-relations, 6 steps, 15 tasks, and 38 activities represented as the\ntriplet of 11 instruments, 8 actions, and 16 objects, totaling 2,113,510 video\nframes and 12,681,060 annotation entities. Correspondingly, we propose a\nmulti-relation purification hybrid network (MURPHY), which aptly incorporates\nnovel relation modules to augment the feature representation by purifying\nrelational features using the intra- and inter-relations embodied in\nannotations. The intra-relation module leverages a R-GCN to implant visual\nfeatures in different graph relations, which are aggregated using a targeted\nrelation purification with affinity information measuring label consistency and\nfeature similarity. The inter-relation module is motivated by attention\nmechanisms to regularize the influence of relational features based on the\nhierarchy of annotation types from the domain knowledge. Extensive experimental\nresults on the curated RLLS dataset confirm the effectiveness of our approach,\ndemonstrating that relations matter in surgical workflow analysis.",

Existing works\non adaptation to unknown environment contexts either assume the contexts are\nthe same for the whole episode or assume the context variables are Markovian.\nHowever, in many real-world applications, the environment context usually stays\nstable for a stochastic period and then changes in an abrupt and unpredictable\nmanner within an episode, resulting in a segment structure, which existing\nworks fail to address.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been a prevailing technique for tackling\nvarious analysis tasks on graph data. A key premise for the remarkable\nperformance of GNNs relies on complete and trustworthy initial graph\ndescriptions (i.e., node features and graph structure), which is often not\nsatisfied since real-world graphs are often incomplete due to various\nunavoidable factors. In particular, GNNs face greater challenges when both node\nfeatures and graph structure are incomplete at the same time. The existing\nmethods either focus on feature completion or structure completion. They\nusually rely on the matching relationship between features and structure, or\nemploy joint learning of node representation and feature (or structure)\ncompletion in the hope of achieving mutual benefit. However, recent studies\nconfirm that the mutual interference between features and structure leads to\nthe degradation of GNN performance. When both features and structure are\nincomplete, the mismatch between features and structure caused by the missing\nrandomness exacerbates the interference between the two, which may trigger\nincorrect completions that negatively affect node representation. To this end,\nin this paper we propose a general GNN framework based on teacher-student\ndistillation to improve the performance of GNNs on incomplete graphs, namely\nT2-GNN. To avoid the interference between features and structure, we separately\ndesign feature-level and structure-level teacher models to provide targeted\nguidance for student model (base GNNs, such as GCN) through distillation. Then\nwe design two personalized methods to obtain well-trained feature and structure\nteachers. To ensure that the knowledge of the teacher model is comprehensively\nand effectively distilled to the student model, we further propose a dual\ndistillation mode to enable the student to acquire as much expert knowledge as\npossible.",

In this study, we\npropose a novel loss function to train neural network models to mitigate this\ncritical issue in this important field. Through rigorous experiments on three\nindependently collected datasets of three different medical imaging domains, we\nempirically show that our proposed loss function consistently performs well\nwith an improvement between 2%-10% macro f1 when compared to the baseline\nmodels. We hope that our work will precipitate new research toward a more\ngeneralized approach to medical image classification.",

    "abstract": "Using geometric landmarks like lines and planes can increase navigation\naccuracy and decrease map storage requirements compared to commonly-used LiDAR\npoint cloud maps. However, landmark-based registration for applications like\nloop closure detection is challenging because a reliable initial guess is not\navailable. Global landmark matching has been investigated in the literature,\nbut these methods typically use ad hoc representations of 3D line and plane\nlandmarks that are not invariant to large viewpoint changes, resulting in\nincorrect matches and high registration error. To address this issue, we adopt\nthe affine Grassmannian manifold to represent 3D lines and planes and prove\nthat the distance between two landmarks is invariant to rotation and\ntranslation if a shift operation is performed before applying the Grassmannian\nmetric. This invariance property enables the use of our graph-based data\nassociation framework for identifying landmark matches that can subsequently be\nused for registration in the least-squares sense. Evaluated on a challenging\nlandmark matching and registration task using publicly-available LiDAR\ndatasets, our approach yields a 1.7x and 3.5x improvement in successful\nregistrations compared to methods that use viewpoint-dependent centroid and\n\"closest point\" representations, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Trap spaces of a Boolean network (BN) are the sub-hypercubes closed by the\nfunction of the BN. A trap space is minimal if it does not contain any smaller\ntrap space. Minimal trap spaces have applications for the analysis of dynamic\nattractors of BNs with various update modes. This paper establishes\ncomputational complexity results of three decision problems related to minimal\ntrap spaces of BNs: the decision of the trap space property of a sub-hypercube,\nthe decision of its minimality, and the decision of the belonging of a given\nconfiguration to a minimal trap space. Under several cases on Boolean function\nspecifications, we investigate the computational complexity of each problem. In\nthe general case, we demonstrate that the trap space property is coNP-complete,\nand the minimality and the belonging properties are $\\Pi_2^{\\text P}$-complete.\nThe complexities drop by one level in the polynomial hierarchy whenever the\nlocal functions of the BN are either unate, or are specified using truth-table,\nbinary decision diagrams, or double-DNF (Petri net encoding): the trap space\nproperty can be decided in P, whereas the minimality and the belonging are\ncoNP-complete.

To be\neffective, some honeywords must appear at least as likely to be user-chosen\npasswords as the real ones, and honeywords must be very difficult to guess\nwithout having breached the database, to prevent false breach alarms. These\ngoals have proved elusive, however, for heuristic honeyword generation\nalgorithms. In this paper we explore an alternative strategy in which the\ndefender treats honeyword selection as a Bernoulli process in which each\npossible password (except the user-chosen one) is selected as a honeyword\nindependently with some fixed probability. We show how Bernoulli honeywords can\nbe integrated into two existing system designs for leveraging honeywords: one\nbased on a honeychecker that stores the secret index of the user-chosen\npassword in the list of account passwords, and another that does not leverage\nsecret state at all. We show that Bernoulli honeywords enable analytic\nderivation of false breach-detection probabilities irrespective of what\ninformation the attacker gathers about the sites' users; that their true and\nfalse breach-detection probabilities demonstrate compelling efficacy; and that\nBernoulli honeywords can even enable performance improvements in modern\nhoneyword system designs.",

    "abstract": "We study the approximability of a broad class of computational problems --\noriginally motivated in evolutionary biology and phylogenetic reconstruction --\nconcerning the aggregation of potentially inconsistent (local) information\nabout $n$ items of interest, and we present optimal hardness of approximation\nresults under the Unique Games Conjecture. The class of problems studied here\ncan be described as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) over infinite\ndomains, where instead of values $\\{0,1\\}$ or a fixed-size domain, the\nvariables can be mapped to any of the $n$ leaves of a phylogenetic tree. The\ntopology of the tree then determines whether a given constraint on the\nvariables is satisfied or not, and the resulting CSPs are called Phylogenetic\nCSPs. Prominent examples of Phylogenetic CSPs with a long history and\napplications in various disciplines include: Triplet Reconstruction, Quartet\nReconstruction, Subtree Aggregation (Forbidden or Desired). For example, in\nTriplet Reconstruction, we are given $m$ triplets of the form $ij|k$\n(indicating that ``items $i,j$ are more similar to each other than to $k$'')\nand we want to construct a hierarchical clustering on the $n$ items, that\nrespects the constraints as much as possible. Despite more than four decades of\nresearch, the basic question of maximizing the number of satisfied constraints\nis not well-understood. The current best approximation is achieved by\noutputting a random tree (for triplets, this achieves a 1/3 approximation). Our\nmain result is that every Phylogenetic CSP is approximation resistant, i.e.,\nthere is no polynomial-time algorithm that does asymptotically better than a\n(biased) random assignment. This is a generalization of the results in\nGuruswami, Hastad, Manokaran, Raghavendra, and Charikar (2011), who showed that\nordering CSPs are approximation resistant (e.g., Max Acyclic Subgraph,\nBetweenness).",

GraphCast also\noutperforms the most accurate previous ML-based weather forecasting model on\n99.2% of the 252 targets it reported. GraphCast can generate a 10-day forecast\n(35 gigabytes of data) in under 60 seconds on Cloud TPU v4 hardware. Unlike\ntraditional forecasting methods, ML-based forecasting scales well with data: by\ntraining on bigger, higher quality, and more recent data, the skill of the\nforecasts can improve. Together these results represent a key step forward in\ncomplementing and improving weather modeling with ML, open new opportunities\nfor fast, accurate forecasting, and help realize the promise of ML-based\nsimulation in the physical sciences.",

Many work striving for\nthis goal have been emerging with the development of robotics, both hardware\nand software.

Chemical named entity recognition (NER) models have the potential\nto impact a wide range of downstream tasks, from identifying adverse drug\nreactions to general pharmacoepidemiology. However, it is unknown whether these\nmodels work the same for everyone. Performance disparities can potentially\ncause harm rather than the intended good. Hence, in this paper, we measure\ngender-related performance disparities of chemical NER systems.\nMaterials and Methods. We develop a framework to measure gender bias in\nchemical NER models using synthetic data and a newly annotated dataset of over\n92,405 words with self-identified gender information from Reddit. We applied\nand evaluated state-of-the-art biomedical NER models.\nResults. Our findings indicate that chemical NER models are biased. The\nresults of the bias tests on the synthetic dataset and the real-world data\nmultiple fairness issues. For example, for synthetic data, we find that\nfemale-related names are generally classified as chemicals, particularly in\ndatasets containing many brand names rather than standard ones. For both\ndatasets, we find consistent fairness issues resulting in substantial\nperformance disparities between female- and male-related data.\nDiscussion. Our study highlights the issue of biases in chemical NER models.\nFor example, we find that many systems cannot detect contraceptives (e.g.,\nbirth control).\nConclusion.

Many SDoH items are not\ncoded in structured forms in electronic health records. These items are often\ncaptured in free-text clinical notes, but there are limited methods for\nautomatically extracting them. We explore a multi-stage pipeline involving\nnamed entity recognition (NER), relation classification (RC), and text\nclassification methods to extract SDoH information from clinical notes\nautomatically.\nMaterials and Methods. The study uses the N2C2 Shared Task data, which was\ncollected from two sources of clinical notes: MIMIC-III and University of\nWashington Harborview Medical Centers. It contains 4480 social history sections\nwith full annotation for twelve SDoHs. In order to handle the issue of\noverlapping entities, we developed a novel marker-based NER model.

Such a reformulation\nopens up the possibility of running existing multi-task RL methods as a more\nefficient alternative to solving a single challenging task from scratch. In\nthis work, we provide a theoretical framework that reformulates a single-task\nRL problem as a multi-task RL problem defined by a curriculum. Under mild\nregularity conditions on the curriculum, we show that sequentially solving each\ntask in the multi-task RL problem is more computationally efficient than\nsolving the original single-task problem, without any explicit exploration\nbonuses or other exploration strategies.

    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication has been proposed as a potential\nsolution to improve the robustness and safety of autonomous vehicles by\nimproving coordination and removing the barrier of non-line-of-sight sensing.\nCooperative Vehicle Safety (CVS) applications are tightly dependent on the\nreliability of the underneath data system, which can suffer from loss of\ninformation due to the inherent issues of their different components, such as\nsensors failures or the poor performance of V2X technologies under dense\ncommunication channel load. Particularly, information loss affects the target\nclassification module and, subsequently, the safety application performance. To\nenable reliable and robust CVS systems that mitigate the effect of information\nloss, we proposed a Context-Aware Target Classification (CA-TC) module coupled\nwith a hybrid learning-based predictive modeling technique for CVS systems. The\nCA-TC consists of two modules: A Context-Aware Map (CAM), and a Hybrid Gaussian\nProcess (HGP) prediction system. Consequently, the vehicle safety applications\nuse the information from the CA-TC, making them more robust and reliable. The\nCAM leverages vehicles path history, road geometry, tracking, and prediction;\nand the HGP is utilized to provide accurate vehicles' trajectory predictions to\ncompensate for data loss (due to communication congestion) or sensor\nmeasurements' inaccuracies. Based on offline real-world data, we learn a finite\nbank of driver models that represent the joint dynamics of the vehicle and the\ndrivers' behavior. We combine offline training and online model updates with\non-the-fly forecasting to account for new possible driver behaviors.

Due to the diverse business logic of\nmicroservices, there are no one-size-fits-all microservice resilience testing\nrules. As the quantity and dynamic of microservices and failures largely\nincrease, manual configuration exhibits its scalability and adaptivity issues.\nTo overcome the two issues, we empirically compare the impacts of common\nfailures in the resilient and unresilient deployments of a benchmark\nmicroservice system. Our study demonstrates that the resilient deployment can\nblock the propagation of degradation from system performance metrics (e.g.,\nmemory usage) to business metrics (e.g., response latency). In this paper, we\npropose AVERT, the first AdaptiVE Resilience Testing framework for microservice\nsystems. AVERT first injects failures into microservices and collects available\nmonitoring metrics. Then AVERT ranks all the monitoring metrics according to\ntheir contributions to the overall service degradation caused by the injected\nfailures. Lastly, AVERT produces a resilience index by how much the degradation\nin system performance metrics propagates to the degradation in business\nmetrics. The higher the degradation propagation, the lower the resilience of\nthe microservice system. We evaluate AVERT on two open-source benchmark\nmicroservice systems.

    "title": "Deep Cost-sensitive Learning for Wheat Frost Detection",
    "abstract": "Frost damage is one of the main factors leading to wheat yield reduction.\nTherefore, the detection of wheat frost accurately and efficiently is\nbeneficial for growers to take corresponding measures in time to reduce\neconomic loss. To detect the wheat frost, in this paper we create a\nhyperspectral wheat frost data set by collecting the data characterized by\ntemperature, wheat yield, and hyperspectral information provided by the\nhandheld hyperspectral spectrometer. However, due to the imbalance of data,\nthat is, the number of healthy samples is much higher than the number of frost\ndamage samples, a deep learning algorithm tends to predict biasedly towards the\nhealthy samples resulting in model overfitting of the healthy samples.\nTherefore, we propose a method based on deep cost-sensitive learning, which\nuses a one-dimensional convolutional neural network as the basic framework and\nincorporates cost-sensitive learning with fixed factors and adjustment factors\ninto the loss function to train the network. Meanwhile, the accuracy and score\nare used as evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that the detection\naccuracy and the score reached 0.943 and 0.623 respectively, this demonstration\nshows that this method not only ensures the overall accuracy but also\neffectively improves the detection rate of frost samples.",

    "abstract": "Sign language recognition (SLR) aims to overcome the communication barrier\nfor the people with deafness or the people with hard hearing. Most existing\napproaches can be typically divided into two lines, i.e., Skeleton-based and\nRGB-based methods, but both the two lines of methods have their limitations.\nRGB-based approaches usually overlook the fine-grained hand structure, while\nSkeleton-based methods do not take the facial expression into account. In\nattempts to address both limitations, we propose a new framework named\nSpatial-temporal Part-aware network (StepNet), based on RGB parts. As the name\nimplies, StepNet consists of two modules: Part-level Spatial Modeling and\nPart-level Temporal Modeling. Particularly, without using any keypoint-level\nannotations, Part-level Spatial Modeling implicitly captures the\nappearance-based properties, such as hands and faces, in the feature space. On\nthe other hand, Part-level Temporal Modeling captures the pertinent properties\nover time by implicitly mining the long-short term context. Extensive\nexperiments show that our StepNet, thanks to Spatial-temporal modules, achieves\ncompetitive Top-1 Per-instance accuracy on three widely-used SLR benchmarks,\ni.e., 56.89% on WLASL, 77.2% on NMFs-CSL, and 77.1% on BOBSL. Moreover, the\nproposed method is compatible with the optical flow input, and can yield higher\nperformance if fused. We hope that this work can serve as a preliminary step\nfor the people with deafness.",

    "abstract": "Bicubic four-sided patches are widely used in computer graphics, CAD/CAM\nsystems etc. Their flexibility is high and enables to compress a surface\ndescription before final rendering. However, computer graphics hardware\nsupports only triangular meshes. Therefore, four-sided bicubic patches are\napproximated by a triangular mesh. The border curves of a bicubic patch are of\ndegree 3, while diagonal and anti-diagonal curves are of degree 6. Therefore\nthe resulting shape and texturing depend on the actual mapping, i.e. how the\ntessellation of a bicubic patch is made. The proposed new modification of the\nHermite bicubic patch, the HS-patch, is a result of additional restriction put\non the Hermite bicubic patch formulation - the diagonal and anti-diagonal\ncurves are of degree 3. This requirement leads to a new Hermite based bicubic\nfour-sided patch with 12 control points and another 4 control points, i.e.\ntwist vectors, are computed from those 12 control points.",

Robust\nwatermarking is a known approach to maintaining copyright protection.\nRobustness and imperceptibility are two factors that are tried to be maximized\nthrough watermarking. Usually, there is a trade-off between these two\nparameters. Increasing the robustness would lessen the imperceptibility of the\nwatermarking. This paper proposes an adaptive method that determines the\nstrength of the watermark embedding in different parts of the cover image\nregarding its texture and brightness. Adaptive embedding increases the\nrobustness while preserving the quality of the watermarked image.

Our major\ncontribution is a novel learning scheme which removes the drawbacks of previous\nworks, namely the strong dependency on co-modalities or additional refinement.\nThese have been previously necessary to provide training signals for\nconvergence. We formulate such a scheme as two sub-optimisation problems on\ntexture learning and pose learning.

Combining these two capabilities allows then to\nsynthesise photorealistic novel views to supervise the pose estimator with\naccurate geometry.

    "title": "Assessing the Impact of Interface Vulnerabilities in Compartmentalized  Software",
    "abstract": "Least-privilege separation decomposes applications into compartments limited\nto accessing only what they need. When compartmentalizing existing software,\nmany approaches neglect securing the new inter-compartment interfaces, although\nwhat used to be a function call from/to a trusted component is now potentially\na targeted attack from a malicious compartment. This results in an entire class\nof security bugs: Compartment Interface Vulnerabilities (CIVs).\nThis paper provides an in-depth study of CIVs. We taxonomize these issues and\nshow that they affect all known compartmentalization approaches. We propose\nConfFuzz, an in-memory fuzzer specialized to detect CIVs at possible\ncompartment boundaries. We apply ConfFuzz to a set of 25 popular applications\nand 36 possible compartment APIs, to uncover a wide data-set of 629\nvulnerabilities. We systematically study these issues, and extract numerous\ninsights on the prevalence of CIVs, their causes, impact, and the complexity to\naddress them. We stress the critical importance of CIVs in compartmentalization\napproaches, demonstrating an attack to extract isolated keys in OpenSSL and\nuncovering a decade-old vulnerability in sudo. We show, among others, that not\nall interfaces are affected in the same way, that API size is uncorrelated with\nCIV prevalence, and that addressing interface vulnerabilities goes beyond\nwriting simple checks. We conclude the paper with guidelines for CIV-aware\ncompartment interface design, and appeal for more research towards systematic\nCIV detection and mitigation.",

    "abstract": "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising paradigm to\nprovide both sensing and communication (S&C) services in vehicular networks.\nHowever, the power of echo signals reflected from vehicles may be too weak to\nbe used for future precise positioning, due to the practically small radar\ncross section of vehicles with random reflection/scattering coefficient. To\ntackle this issue, we propose a novel mutual assistance scheme for intelligent\nsurface-mounted vehicles, where S&C are innovatively designed to assist each\nother for achieving an efficient win-win integration, i.e., sensing-assisted\nphase shift design and communication-assisted high-precision sensing.\nSpecifically, we first derive closed-form expressions of the echo power and\nachievable rate under uncertain angle information. Then, the communication rate\nis maximized while satisfying sensing requirements, which is proved to be a\nmonotonic optimization problem on time allocation. Furthermore, we unveil the\nfeasible condition of the problem and propose a polyblock-based optimal\nalgorithm. Simulation results validate that the performance trade-off bound of\nS&C is significantly enlarged by the novel design exploiting mutual assistance\nin intelligent surface-aided vehicular networks.",

    "abstract": "In real-time and high-resolution Earth observation imagery, Low Earth Orbit\n(LEO) satellites capture images that are subsequently transmitted to ground to\ncreate an updated map of an area of interest. Such maps provide valuable\ninformation for meteorology or environmental monitoring, but can also be\nemployed in near-real time operation for disaster detection, identification,\nand management. However, the amount of data generated by these applications can\neasily exceed the communication capabilities of LEO satellites, leading to\ncongestion and packet dropping. To avoid these problems, the Inter-Satellite\nLinks (ISLs) can be used to distribute the data among the satellites for\nprocessing. In this paper, we address an energy minimization problem based on a\ngeneral satellite mobile edge computing (SMEC) framework for real-time and\nvery-high resolution Earth observation. Our results illustrate that the optimal\nallocation of data and selection of the compression parameters increase the\namount of images that the system can support by a factor of 12 when compared to\ndirectly downloading the data.

Thus, besides individual actions' reward, learning the causal\nrelations is essential to improve the decision-making strategy. To solve the\ntwo-fold learning problem described above, we develop the 'combinatorial\nsemi-bandit framework with causally related rewards', where we model the causal\nrelations by a directed graph in a stationary structural equation model. The\nnodal observation in the graph signal comprises the corresponding base arm's\ninstantaneous reward and an additional term resulting from the causal\ninfluences of other base arms' rewards. The objective is to maximize the\nlong-term average payoff, which is a linear function of the base arms' rewards\nand depends strongly on the network topology. To achieve this objective, we\npropose a policy that determines the causal relations by learning the network's\ntopology and simultaneously exploits this knowledge to optimize the\ndecision-making process.

    "abstract": "Urban traffic speed prediction aims to estimate the future traffic speed for\nimproving the urban transportation services. Enormous efforts have been made on\nexploiting spatial correlations and temporal dependencies of traffic speed\nevolving patterns by leveraging explicit spatial relations (geographical\nproximity) through pre-defined geographical structures ({\\it e.g.}, region\ngrids or road networks). While achieving promising results, current traffic\nspeed prediction methods still suffer from ignoring implicit spatial\ncorrelations (interactions), which cannot be captured by grid/graph\nconvolutions. To tackle the challenge, we propose a generic model for enabling\nthe current traffic speed prediction methods to preserve implicit spatial\ncorrelations. Specifically, we first develop a Dual-Transformer architecture,\nincluding a Spatial Transformer and a Temporal Transformer. The Spatial\nTransformer automatically learns the implicit spatial correlations across the\nroad segments beyond the boundary of geographical structures, while the\nTemporal Transformer aims to capture the dynamic changing patterns of the\nimplicit spatial correlations. Then, to further integrate both explicit and\nimplicit spatial correlations, we propose a distillation-style learning\nframework, in which the existing traffic speed prediction methods are\nconsidered as the teacher model, and the proposed Dual-Transformer\narchitectures are considered as the student model. The extensive experiments\nover three real-world datasets indicate significant improvements of our\nproposed framework over the existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) has gained a lot of attention in the field of\nmodel compression for edge devices thanks to its effectiveness in compressing\nlarge powerful networks into smaller lower-capacity models. Online\ndistillation, in which both the teacher and the student are learning\ncollaboratively, has also gained much interest due to its ability to improve on\nthe performance of the networks involved. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\nensures the proper knowledge transfer between the teacher and student. However,\nmost online KD techniques present some bottlenecks under the network capacity\ngap. By cooperatively and simultaneously training, the models the KL distance\nbecomes incapable of properly minimizing the teacher's and student's\ndistributions. Alongside accuracy, critical edge device applications are in\nneed of well-calibrated compact networks. Confidence calibration provides a\nsensible way of getting trustworthy predictions. We propose BD-KD: Balancing of\nDivergences for online Knowledge Distillation. We show that adaptively\nbalancing between the reverse and forward divergences shifts the focus of the\ntraining strategy to the compact student network without limiting the teacher\nnetwork's learning process. We demonstrate that, by performing this balancing\ndesign at the level of the student distillation loss, we improve upon both\nperformance accuracy and calibration of the compact student network. We\nconducted extensive experiments using a variety of network architectures and\nshow improvements on multiple datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,\nTiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), originally proposed for node classification,\nhave also motivated many recent works on edge prediction (a.k.a., link\nprediction). However, existing methods lack elaborate design regarding the\ndistinctions between two tasks that have been frequently overlooked: (i) edges\nonly constitute the topology in the node classification task but can be used as\nboth the topology and the supervisions (i.e., labels) in the edge prediction\ntask; (ii) the node classification makes prediction over each individual node,\nwhile the edge prediction is determinated by each pair of nodes. To this end,\nwe propose a novel edge prediction paradigm named Edge-aware Message PassIng\nneuRal nEtworks (EMPIRE). Concretely, we first introduce an edge splitting\ntechnique to specify use of each edge where each edge is solely used as either\nthe topology or the supervision (named as topology edge or supervision edge).\nWe then develop a new message passing mechanism that generates the messages to\nsource nodes (through topology edges) being aware of target nodes (through\nsupervision edges). In order to emphasize the differences between pairs\nconnected by supervision edges and pairs unconnected, we further weight the\nmessages to highlight the relative ones that can reflect the differences. In\naddition, we design a novel negative node-pair sampling trick that efficiently\nsamples 'hard' negative instances in the supervision instances, and can\nsignificantly improve the performance. Experimental results verify that the\nproposed method can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art models\nregarding the edge prediction task on multiple homogeneous and heterogeneous\ngraph datasets.",

However, the\ninconsistency between the mixed images and the corresponding labels harms its\nefficacy. Existing CutMix variants tackle this problem by generating more\nconsistent mixed images or more precise mixed labels, but inevitably introduce\nheavy training overhead or require extra information, undermining ease of use.\nTo this end, we propose an efficient and effective Self-Motivated image Mixing\nmethod (SMMix), which motivates both image and label enhancement by the model\nunder training itself. Specifically, we propose a max-min attention region\nmixing approach that enriches the attention-focused objects in the mixed\nimages. Then, we introduce a fine-grained label assignment technique that\nco-trains the output tokens of mixed images with fine-grained supervision.\nMoreover, we devise a novel feature consistency constraint to align features\nfrom mixed and unmixed images. Due to the subtle designs of the self-motivated\nparadigm, our SMMix is significant in its smaller training overhead and better\nperformance than other CutMix variants. In particular, SMMix improves the\naccuracy of DeiT-T/S, CaiT-XXS-24/36, and PVT-T/S/M/L by more than +1% on\nImageNet-1k.

In this problem, $N$ independent files are replicated across\n$S \\geq 2$ non-colluding servers. There are $K$ users, each equipped with cache\nmemory which can store $M$ files. Each user wants to retrieve a file from the\nservers, but the users don't want any of the servers to get any information\nabout their demand. The user caches are filled with some arbitrary function of\nthe files before the users decide their demands, known as the placement phase.\nAfter deciding their demands, users cooperatively send queries to the servers\nto retrieve their desired files privately. Upon receiving the queries, servers\nbroadcast coded transmissions which are a function of the queries they received\nand the files, known as the delivery phase. Conveying queries to the servers\nincurs an upload cost for the users, and downloading the answers broadcasted by\nthe servers incurs a download cost. To implement cache-aided MuPIR schemes,\neach file has to be split into $F$ packets. In this paper, we propose MuPIR\nschemes that utilize placement delivery arrays (PDAs) to characterize placement\nand delivery. Proposed MuPIR schemes significantly reduce subpacketization\nlevels while slightly increasing the download cost. The proposed scheme also\nsubstantially reduces the upload cost for the users. For PDAs based on {\\it\nAli-Niesen} scheme for centralized coded caching, we show that our scheme is\norder optimal in terms of download cost. We recover the optimal single-user PIR\nscheme presented by {\\it Tian et al.} as a special case.

Recently, diffusion autoencoders\n(Diff-AE) have been proposed to explore DPMs for representation learning via\nautoencoding. Their key idea is to jointly train an encoder for discovering\nmeaningful representations from images and a conditional DPM as the decoder for\nreconstructing images. Considering that training DPMs from scratch will take a\nlong time and there have existed numerous pre-trained DPMs, we propose\n\\textbf{P}re-trained \\textbf{D}PM \\textbf{A}uto\\textbf{E}ncoding\n(\\textbf{PDAE}), a general method to adapt existing pre-trained DPMs to the\ndecoders for image reconstruction, with better training efficiency and\nperformance than Diff-AE. Specifically, we find that the reason that\npre-trained DPMs fail to reconstruct an image from its latent variables is due\nto the information loss of forward process, which causes a gap between their\npredicted posterior mean and the true one. From this perspective, the\nclassifier-guided sampling method can be explained as computing an extra mean\nshift to fill the gap, reconstructing the lost class information in samples.\nThese imply that the gap corresponds to the lost information of the image, and\nwe can reconstruct the image by filling the gap. Drawing inspiration from this,\nwe employ a trainable model to predict a mean shift according to encoded\nrepresentation and train it to fill as much gap as possible, in this way, the\nencoder is forced to learn as much information as possible from images to help\nthe filling. By reusing a part of network of pre-trained DPMs and redesigning\nthe weighting scheme of diffusion loss, PDAE can learn meaningful\nrepresentations from images efficiently.

    "abstract": "We propose a fairness-aware learning framework that mitigates intersectional\nsubgroup bias associated with protected attributes. Prior research has\nprimarily focused on mitigating one kind of bias by incorporating complex\nfairness-driven constraints into optimization objectives or designing\nadditional layers that focus on specific protected attributes. We introduce a\nsimple and generic bias mitigation approach that prevents models from learning\nrelationships between protected attributes and output variable by reducing\nmutual information between them. We demonstrate that our approach is effective\nin reducing bias with little or no drop in accuracy. We also show that the\nmodels trained with our learning framework become causally fair and insensitive\nto the values of protected attributes. Finally, we validate our approach by\nstudying feature interactions between protected and non-protected attributes.\nWe demonstrate that these interactions are significantly reduced when applying\nour bias mitigation.",

Using end-to-end spoken language understanding (SLU), the\nintents of the speaker are predicted directly from the speech signal without\nrequiring intermediate text transcripts. As a result, the model can optimize\ndirectly for intent classification and avoid cascading errors from ASR. The\nend-to-end SLU system also helps in reducing the latency of the intent\nprediction model. Although many datasets are available publicly for\ntext-to-intent tasks, the availability of labeled speech-to-intent datasets is\nlimited, and there are no datasets available in the Indian accent. In this\npaper, we release the Skit-S2I dataset, the first publicly available\nIndian-accented SLU dataset in the banking domain in a conversational tonality.\nWe experiment with multiple baselines, compare different pretrained speech\nencoder's representations, and find that SSL pretrained representations perform\nslightly better than ASR pretrained representations lacking prosodic features\nfor speech-to-intent classification.

    "abstract": "Most deep-learning-based continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) models\nshare a similar backbone consisting of a visual module, a sequential module,\nand an alignment module. However, due to limited training samples, a\nconnectionist temporal classification loss may not train such CSLR backbones\nsufficiently. In this work, we propose three auxiliary tasks to enhance the\nCSLR backbones. The first task enhances the visual module, which is sensitive\nto the insufficient training problem, from the perspective of consistency.\nSpecifically, since the information of sign languages is mainly included in\nsigners' facial expressions and hand movements, a keypoint-guided spatial\nattention module is developed to enforce the visual module to focus on\ninformative regions, i.e., spatial attention consistency. Second, noticing that\nboth the output features of the visual and sequential modules represent the\nsame sentence, to better exploit the backbone's power, a sentence embedding\nconsistency constraint is imposed between the visual and sequential modules to\nenhance the representation power of both features. We name the CSLR model\ntrained with the above auxiliary tasks as consistency-enhanced CSLR, which\nperforms well on signer-dependent datasets in which all signers appear during\nboth training and testing. To make it more robust for the signer-independent\nsetting, a signer removal module based on feature disentanglement is further\nproposed to remove signer information from the backbone. Extensive ablation\nstudies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of these auxiliary tasks.\nMore remarkably, with a transformer-based backbone, our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art or competitive performance on five benchmarks, PHOENIX-2014,\nPHOENIX-2014-T, PHOENIX-2014-SI, CSL, and CSL-Daily.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we target at the problem of learning a generalizable dynamic\nradiance field from monocular videos. Different from most existing NeRF methods\nthat are based on multiple views, monocular videos only contain one view at\neach timestamp, thereby suffering from ambiguity along the view direction in\nestimating point features and scene flows. Previous studies such as DynNeRF\ndisambiguate point features by positional encoding, which is not transferable\nand severely limits the generalization ability. As a result, these methods have\nto train one independent model for each scene and suffer from heavy\ncomputational costs when applying to increasing monocular videos in real-world\napplications. To address this, We propose MonoNeRF to simultaneously learn\npoint features and scene flows with point trajectory and feature correspondence\nconstraints across frames. More specifically, we learn an implicit velocity\nfield to estimate point trajectory from temporal features with Neural ODE,\nwhich is followed by a flow-based feature aggregation module to obtain spatial\nfeatures along the point trajectory. We jointly optimize temporal and spatial\nfeatures by training the network in an end-to-end manner.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in NLU and NLP have resulted in renewed interest in natural\nlanguage interfaces to data, which provide an easy mechanism for non-technical\nusers to access and query the data. While early systems evolved from keyword\nsearch and focused on simple factual queries, the complexity of both the input\nsentences as well as the generated SQL queries has evolved over time. More\nrecently, there has also been a lot of focus on using conversational interfaces\nfor data analytics, empowering a line of non-technical users with quick\ninsights into the data. There are three main challenges in natural language\nquerying (NLQ): (1) identifying the entities involved in the user utterance,\n(2) connecting the different entities in a meaningful way over the underlying\ndata source to interpret user intents, and (3) generating a structured query in\nthe form of SQL or SPARQL.\nThere are two main approaches for interpreting a user's NLQ. Rule-based\nsystems make use of semantic indices, ontologies, and KGs to identify the\nentities in the query, understand the intended relationships between those\nentities, and utilize grammars to generate the target queries. With the\nadvances in deep learning (DL)-based language models, there have been many\ntext-to-SQL approaches that try to interpret the query holistically using DL\nmodels. Hybrid approaches that utilize both rule-based techniques as well as DL\nmodels are also emerging by combining the strengths of both approaches.\nConversational interfaces are the next natural step to one-shot NLQ by\nexploiting query context between multiple turns of conversation for\ndisambiguation. In this article, we review the background technologies that are\nused in natural language interfaces, and survey the different approaches to\nNLQ. We also describe conversational interfaces for data analytics and discuss\nseveral benchmarks used for NLQ research and evaluation.",

Experiment 3 examined the ability of four different navigation\nmethods by performing navigation tasks in a virtual environment.

    "abstract": "How to learn an effective reinforcement learning-based model for control\ntasks from high-level visual observations is a practical and challenging\nproblem. A key to solving this problem is to learn low-dimensional state\nrepresentations from observations, from which an effective policy can be\nlearned. In order to boost the learning of state encoding, recent works are\nfocused on capturing behavioral similarities between state representations or\napplying data augmentation on visual observations. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel meta-learner-based framework for representation learning regarding\nbehavioral similarities for reinforcement learning. Specifically, our framework\nencodes the high-dimensional observations into two decomposed embeddings\nregarding reward and dynamics in a Markov Decision Process (MDP). A pair of\nmeta-learners are developed, one of which quantifies the reward similarity and\nthe other quantifies dynamics similarity over the correspondingly decomposed\nembeddings. The meta-learners are self-learned to update the state embeddings\nby approximating two disjoint terms in on-policy bisimulation metric. To\nincorporate the reward and dynamics terms, we further develop a strategy to\nadaptively balance their impacts based on different tasks or environments. We\nempirically demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines on several benchmarks, including conventional DM\nControl Suite, Distracting DM Control Suite and a self-driving task CARLA.",

    "abstract": "Current mainstream object detection methods for large aerial images usually\ndivide large images into patches and then exhaustively detect the objects of\ninterest on all patches, no matter whether there exist objects or not. This\nparadigm, although effective, is inefficient because the detectors have to go\nthrough all patches, severely hindering the inference speed. This paper\npresents an Objectness Activation Network (OAN) to help detectors focus on\nfewer patches but achieve more efficient inference and more accurate results,\nenabling a simple and effective solution to object detection in large images.\nIn brief, OAN is a light fully-convolutional network for judging whether each\npatch contains objects or not, which can be easily integrated into many object\ndetectors and jointly trained with them end-to-end. We extensively evaluate our\nOAN with five advanced detectors. Using OAN, all five detectors acquire more\nthan 30.0% speed-up on three large-scale aerial image datasets, meanwhile with\nconsistent accuracy improvements. On extremely large Gaofen-2 images\n(29200$\\times$27620 pixels), our OAN improves the detection speed by 70.5%.\nMoreover, we extend our OAN to driving-scene object detection and 4K video\nobject detection, boosting the detection speed by 112.1% and 75.0%,\nrespectively, without sacrificing the accuracy.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in\nnatural language understanding and generation, but the quality bar for medical\nand clinical applications is high. Today, attempts to assess models' clinical\nknowledge typically rely on automated evaluations on limited benchmarks. There\nis no standard to evaluate model predictions and reasoning across a breadth of\ntasks. To address this, we present MultiMedQA, a benchmark combining six\nexisting open question answering datasets spanning professional medical exams,\nresearch, and consumer queries; and HealthSearchQA, a new free-response dataset\nof medical questions searched online. We propose a framework for human\nevaluation of model answers along multiple axes including factuality,\nprecision, possible harm, and bias. In addition, we evaluate PaLM (a\n540-billion parameter LLM) and its instruction-tuned variant, Flan-PaLM, on\nMultiMedQA. Using a combination of prompting strategies, Flan-PaLM achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on every MultiMedQA multiple-choice dataset (MedQA,\nMedMCQA, PubMedQA, MMLU clinical topics), including 67.6% accuracy on MedQA (US\nMedical License Exam questions), surpassing prior state-of-the-art by over 17%.\nHowever, human evaluation reveals key gaps in Flan-PaLM responses. To resolve\nthis we introduce instruction prompt tuning, a parameter-efficient approach for\naligning LLMs to new domains using a few exemplars. The resulting model,\nMed-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians. We show\nthat comprehension, recall of knowledge, and medical reasoning improve with\nmodel scale and instruction prompt tuning, suggesting the potential utility of\nLLMs in medicine. Our human evaluations reveal important limitations of today's\nmodels, reinforcing the importance of both evaluation frameworks and method\ndevelopment in creating safe, helpful LLM models for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the formation of musical preferences of millions of users of\nthe NetEase Cloud Music (NCM), one of the largest online music platforms in\nChina. We combine the methods from complex networks theory and information\nsciences within the context of Big Data analysis to unveil statistical patterns\nand community structures underlying the formation and evolution of musical\npreference behaviors. Our analyses address the decay patterns of music\ninfluence, users' sensitivity to music, age and gender differences, and their\nrelationship to regional economic indicators. Employing community detection in\nuser-music bipartite networks, we identified eight major cultural communities\nin the population of NCM users. Female users exhibited higher within-group\nvariability in preference behavior than males, with a major transition\noccurring around the age of 25. Moreveor, the musical tastes and the preference\ndiversity measures of women were also more strongly associated with economic\nfactors. However, in spite of the highly variable popularity of music tracks\nand the identified cultural and demographic differences, we observed that the\nevolution of musical preferences over time followed a power-law-like decaying\nfunction, and that NCM listeners showed the highest sensitivity to music\nreleased in their adolescence, peaking at the age of 13. Our findings suggest\nthe existence of universal properties in the formation of musical tastes but\nalso their culture-specific relationship to demographic factors, with\nwide-ranging implications for community detection and recommendation system\ndesign in online music platforms.",

    "abstract": "The United States coastline spans 95,471 miles; a distance that cannot be\neffectively patrolled or secured by manual human effort alone. Unmanned Aerial\nVehicles (UAVs) equipped with infrared cameras and deep-learning based\nalgorithms represent a more efficient alternative for identifying and\nsegmenting objects of interest - namely, ships. However, standard approaches to\ntraining these algorithms require large-scale datasets of densely labeled\ninfrared maritime images. Such datasets are not publicly available and manually\nannotating every pixel in a large-scale dataset would have an extreme labor\ncost. In this work we demonstrate that, in the context of segmenting ships in\ninfrared imagery, weakly-supervising an algorithm with sparsely labeled data\ncan drastically reduce data labeling costs with minimal impact on system\nperformance. We apply weakly-supervised learning to an unlabeled dataset of\n7055 infrared images sourced from the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft\nDivision (NAWCAD). We find that by sparsely labeling only 32 points per image,\nweakly-supervised segmentation models can still effectively detect and segment\nships, with a Jaccard score of up to 0.756.",

    "abstract": "Training agents via off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL) requires a\nlarge memory, named replay memory, that stores past experiences used for\nlearning. These experiences are sampled, uniformly or non-uniformly, to create\nthe batches used for training. When calculating the loss function, off-policy\nalgorithms assume that all samples are of the same importance. In this paper,\nwe hypothesize that training can be enhanced by assigning different importance\nfor each experience based on their temporal-difference (TD) error directly in\nthe training objective. We propose a novel method that introduces a weighting\nfactor for each experience when calculating the loss function at the learning\nstage. In addition to improving convergence speed when used with uniform\nsampling, the method can be combined with prioritization methods for\nnon-uniform sampling. Combining the proposed method with prioritization methods\nimproves sampling efficiency while increasing the performance of TD-based\noff-policy RL algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed method is\ndemonstrated by experiments in six environments of the OpenAI Gym suite. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 33%~76%\nreduction of convergence speed in three environments and an 11% increase in\nreturns and a 3%~10% increase in success rate for other three environments.",

    "abstract": "Recently, large-scale pre-trained models have shown their advantages in many\ntasks. However, due to the huge computational complexity and storage\nrequirements, it is challenging to apply the large-scale model to real scenes.\nA common solution is knowledge distillation which regards the large-scale model\nas a teacher model and helps to train a small student model to obtain a\ncompetitive performance. Cross-task Knowledge distillation expands the\napplication scenarios of the large-scale pre-trained model. Existing knowledge\ndistillation works focus on directly mimicking the final prediction or the\nintermediate layers of the teacher model, which represent the global-level\ncharacteristics and are task-specific. To alleviate the constraint of different\nlabel spaces, capturing invariant intrinsic local object characteristics (such\nas the shape characteristics of the leg and tail of the cattle and horse) plays\na key role. Considering the complexity and variability of real scene tasks, we\npropose a Prototype-guided Cross-task Knowledge Distillation (ProC-KD) approach\nto transfer the intrinsic local-level object knowledge of a large-scale teacher\nnetwork to various task scenarios. First, to better transfer the generalized\nknowledge in the teacher model in cross-task scenarios, we propose a prototype\nlearning module to learn from the essential feature representation of objects\nin the teacher model. Secondly, for diverse downstream tasks, we propose a\ntask-adaptive feature augmentation module to enhance the features of the\nstudent model with the learned generalization prototype features and guide the\ntraining of the student model to improve its generalization ability. The\nexperimental results on various visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach for large-scale model cross-task knowledge distillation scenes.",

Despite\nevent-based visual odometry having been extensively studied in recent years,\nmost of them are based on monocular and few research on stereo event vision.

Our proposed pipeline achieves\ntemporal tracking and instantaneous matching between consecutive stereo event\nstreams, thereby obtaining robust state estimation.

    "abstract": "Biological systems in nature have evolved for millions of years to adapt and\nsurvive the environment. Many features they developed can be inspirational and\nbeneficial for solving technical problems in modern industries. This leads to a\nspecific form of design-by-analogy called bio-inspired design (BID). Although\nBID as a design method has been proven beneficial, the gap between biology and\nengineering continuously hinders designers from effectively applying the\nmethod. Therefore, we explore the recent advance of artificial intelligence\n(AI) for a data-driven approach to bridge the gap. This paper proposes a\ngenerative design approach based on the generative pre-trained language model\n(PLM) to automatically retrieve and map biological analogy and generate BID in\nthe form of natural language. The latest generative pre-trained transformer,\nnamely GPT-3, is used as the base PLM. Three types of design concept generators\nare identified and fine-tuned from the PLM according to the looseness of the\nproblem space representation. Machine evaluators are also fine-tuned to assess\nthe mapping relevancy between the domains within the generated BID concepts.\nThe approach is evaluated and then employed in a real-world project of\ndesigning light-weighted flying cars during its conceptual design phase The\nresults show our approach can generate BID concepts with good performance.",

Their underlying ability to\nrepresent nodes as summaries of their vicinities has proven effective for\nhomophilous graphs in particular, in which same-type nodes tend to connect. On\nheterophilous graphs, in which different-type nodes are likely connected, GNNs\nperform less consistently, as neighborhood information might be less\nrepresentative or even misleading. On the other hand, GNN performance is not\ninferior on all heterophilous graphs, and there is a lack of understanding of\nwhat other graph properties affect GNN performance.\nIn this work, we highlight the limitations of the widely used homophily ratio\nand the recent Cross-Class Neighborhood Similarity (CCNS) metric in estimating\nGNN performance. To overcome these limitations, we introduce 2-hop Neighbor\nClass Similarity (2NCS), a new quantitative graph structural property that\ncorrelates with GNN performance more strongly and consistently than alternative\nmetrics. 2NCS considers two-hop neighborhoods as a theoretically derived\nconsequence of the two-step label propagation process governing GCN's\ntraining-inference process.

The existing solution to suppress (or\neliminate) the reflected wave impact on the motor insulation run by a Si-IGBT\nor SiC-MOSFET-based drive is to use either a sinewave filter or dv/dt filter.\nThe alternative solution suggested in this article is to implement a\nhigh-bandwidth electronic circuit at the end of the cable or at the motor\nterminals to match the surge impedance of the cable and motor. The\nhigh-frequency voltage ringing due to the reflected waves in motor drives is\naround 1 MHz, depending on the cable parameters and the length of the cable. In\nthe proposed method, the electronic circuit can quickly detect the dv/dt rise\nand fall edges and adjust the electronic circuit equivalent impedance when\npulses arrive the motor terminals. Thus, the cable and motor surge impedances\ncan be matched over a short time to prevent reflected waves.

We apply this index on six political and social\nactivism events on Twitter and analyzed three action types: synchronicity by\nhashtag, URL and @mentions.The CSI provides an overall quantification of\nsynchronization across all action types within an event, which allows ranking\nof a spectrum of synchronicity across the six events. Human users have higher\nsynchronous scores than bot users in most events; and bots and humans exhibits\nthe most synchronized activities across all events as compared to other pairs\n(i.e., bot-bot and human-human). We further rely on the harmony and dissonance\nof CSI-Network scores with network centrality metrics to observe the presence\nof organic/inorganic synchronization. We hope this work aids in investigating\nsynchronized action within social media in a collective manner.",

    "title": "Packing Privacy Budget Efficiently",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models can leak information about users, and\ndifferential privacy (DP) provides a rigorous way to bound that leakage under a\ngiven budget. This DP budget can be regarded as a new type of compute resource\nin workloads of multiple ML models training on user data. Once it is used, the\nDP budget is forever consumed. Therefore, it is crucial to allocate it most\nefficiently to train as many models as possible. This paper presents the\nscheduler for privacy that optimizes for efficiency. We formulate privacy\nscheduling as a new type of multidimensional knapsack problem, called privacy\nknapsack, which maximizes DP budget efficiency. We show that privacy knapsack\nis NP-hard, hence practical algorithms are necessarily approximate. We develop\nan approximation algorithm for privacy knapsack, DPK, and evaluate it on\nmicrobenchmarks and on a new, synthetic private-ML workload we developed from\nthe Alibaba ML cluster trace. We show that DPK: (1) often approaches the\nefficiency-optimal schedule, (2) consistently schedules more tasks compared to\na state-of-the-art privacy scheduling algorithm that focused on fairness\n(1.3-1.7x in Alibaba, 1.0-2.6x in microbenchmarks), but (3) sacrifices some\nlevel of fairness for efficiency. Therefore, using DPK, DP ML operators should\nbe able to train more models on the same amount of user data while offering the\nsame privacy guarantee to their users.",

Among various methods, replay-based approaches that maintain and\nreplay a small episodic memory of previous samples are one of the most\nsuccessful strategies against catastrophic forgetting. However, since\nforgetting is inevitable given bounded memory and unbounded tasks, how to\nforget is a problem continual learning must address. Therefore, beyond simply\navoiding catastrophic forgetting, an under-explored issue is how to reasonably\nforget while ensuring the merits of human memory, including 1. storage\nefficiency, 2. generalizability, and 3. some interpretability. To achieve these\nsimultaneously, our paper proposes a new saliency-augmented memory completion\nframework for continual learning, inspired by recent discoveries in memory\ncompletion separation in cognitive neuroscience. Specifically, we innovatively\npropose to store the part of the image most important to the tasks in episodic\nmemory by saliency map extraction and memory encoding. When learning new tasks,\nprevious data from memory are inpainted by an adaptive data generation module,\nwhich is inspired by how humans complete episodic memory. The module's\nparameters are shared across all tasks and it can be jointly trained with a\ncontinual learning classifier as bilevel optimization.

Our\nanalysis shows that control events exhibit significant diversity in device\ntypes and time-of-day among UEs. Second, we study whether traditional\nprobability distributions that have been widely adopted for modeling Internet\ntraffic can model the control-plane traffic originated from individual UEs. Our\nanalysis shows that the inter-arrival time of the control events as well as the\nsojourn time in the UE states of EMM and ECM for the cellular network cannot be\nmodeled as Poisson processes or other traditional probability distributions. We\nfurther show that the reasons that these models fail to capture the\ncontrol-plane traffic are due to its higher burstiness and longer tails in the\ncumulative distribution than the traditional models. Third, we propose a\ntwo-level hierarchical state-machine-based traffic model for UE clusters\nderived from our adaptive clustering scheme based on the Semi-Markov Model to\ncapture key characteristics of mobile network control-plane traffic -- in\nparticular, the dependence among events generated by each UE, and the diversity\nin device types and time-of-day among UEs.

We aim to leverage this fact, by employing a novel deep\nlearning framework which is a based on a repurposed convolutional autoencoder.\nOur model aims to encode all of the relevant respiratory information contained\nwithin photoplethysmography waveform, and decode it into a waveform that is\nsimilar to a gold standard respiratory reference. The model is employed on two\nphotoplethysmography data sets, namely Capnobase and BIDMC. We show that the\nmodel is capable of producing respiratory waveforms that approach the gold\nstandard, while in turn producing state of the art respiratory rate estimates.\nWe also show that when it comes to capturing more advanced respiratory waveform\ncharacteristics such as duty cycle, our model is for the most part\nunsuccessful. A suggested reason for this, in light of a previous study on\nin-ear PPG, is that the respiratory variations in finger-PPG are far weaker\ncompared with other recording locations. Importantly, our model can perform\nthese waveform estimates in a fraction of a millisecond, giving it the capacity\nto produce over 6 hours of respiratory waveforms in a single second. Moreover,\nwe attempt to interpret the behaviour of the kernel weights within the model,\nshowing that in part our model intuitively selects different breathing\nfrequencies.

    "abstract": "A canonical algorithm for log-concave sampling is the Langevin Algorithm, aka\nthe Langevin Diffusion run with some discretization stepsize $\\eta > 0$. This\ndiscretization leads the Langevin Algorithm to have a stationary distribution\n$\\pi_{\\eta}$ which differs from the stationary distribution $\\pi$ of the\nLangevin Diffusion, and it is an important challenge to understand whether the\nwell-known properties of $\\pi$ extend to $\\pi_{\\eta}$. In particular, while\nconcentration properties such as isoperimetry and rapidly decaying tails are\nclassically known for $\\pi$, the analogous properties for $\\pi_{\\eta}$ are open\nquestions with direct algorithmic implications. This note provides a first step\nin this direction by establishing concentration results for $\\pi_{\\eta}$ that\nmirror classical results for $\\pi$. Specifically, we show that for any\nnontrivial stepsize $\\eta > 0$, $\\pi_{\\eta}$ is sub-exponential (respectively,\nsub-Gaussian) when the potential is convex (respectively, strongly convex).\nMoreover, the concentration bounds we show are essentially tight.\nKey to our analysis is the use of a rotation-invariant moment generating\nfunction (aka Bessel function) to study the stationary dynamics of the Langevin\nAlgorithm. This technique may be of independent interest because it enables\ndirectly analyzing the discrete-time stationary distribution $\\pi_{\\eta}$\nwithout going through the continuous-time stationary distribution $\\pi$ as an\nintermediary.",

To fulfill this vision, we consider a\nride-hailing platform that expands the multimodal charging network with a\nmulti-stage investment budget and operates a ride-hailing fleet to maximize its\nprofit. A multi-stage network expansion model is proposed to characterize the\ncoupled planning and operational decisions, which captures demand elasticity,\npassenger waiting time, charging and swapping waiting times, as well as their\ndependence on fleet status and charging infrastructure. The overall problem is\nformulated as a nonconvex program. Instead of pursuing the globally optimal\nsolution, we establish a theoretical upper bound through relaxation,\nreformulation, and decomposition so that the global optimality of the derived\nsolution to the nonconvex problem is verifiable. In the case study for\nManhattan, we find that the two facilities complement each other and play\ndifferent roles during the expansion of charging infrastructure: at the early\nstage, the platform always prioritizes building charging stations to electrify\nthe fleet, after which it initiates the deployment of swapping stations to\nenhance fleet utilization.

    "abstract": "Latent factor model estimation typically relies on either using domain\nknowledge to manually pick several observed covariates as factor proxies, or\npurely conducting multivariate analysis such as principal component analysis.\nHowever, the former approach may suffer from the bias while the latter can not\nincorporate additional information. We propose to bridge these two approaches\nwhile allowing the number of factor proxies to diverge, and hence make the\nlatent factor model estimation robust, flexible, and statistically more\naccurate. As a bonus, the number of factors is also allowed to grow. At the\nheart of our method is a penalized reduced rank regression to combine\ninformation. To further deal with heavy-tailed data, a computationally\nattractive penalized robust reduced rank regression method is proposed. We\nestablish faster rates of convergence compared with the benchmark. Extensive\nsimulations and real examples are used to illustrate the advantages.",

Here\nwe present data class-specific transformations all-optically performed between\nthe input and output fields-of-view (FOVs) of a diffractive network. The visual\ninformation of the objects is encoded into the amplitude (A), phase (P), or\nintensity (I) of the optical field at the input, which is all-optically\nprocessed by a data class-specific diffractive network. At the output, an image\nsensor-array directly measures the transformed patterns, all-optically\nencrypted using the transformation matrices pre-assigned to different data\nclasses, i.e., a separate matrix for each data class. The original input images\ncan be recovered by applying the correct decryption key (the inverse\ntransformation) corresponding to the matching data class, while applying any\nother key will lead to loss of information. The class-specificity of these\nall-optical diffractive transformations creates opportunities where different\nkeys can be distributed to different users; each user can only decode the\nacquired images of only one data class, serving multiple users in an\nall-optically encrypted manner. We numerically demonstrated all-optical\nclass-specific transformations covering A-->A, I-->I, and P-->I transformations\nusing various image datasets.

    "title": "On linear-algebraic notions of expansion",
    "abstract": "A fundamental fact about bounded-degree graph expanders is that three notions\nof expansion -- vertex expansion, edge expansion, and spectral expansion -- are\nall equivalent. In this paper, we study to what extent such a statement is true\nfor linear-algebraic notions of expansion.\nThere are two well-studied notions of linear-algebraic expansion, namely\ndimension expansion (defined in analogy to graph vertex expansion) and quantum\nexpansion (defined in analogy to graph spectral expansion). Lubotzky and\nZelmanov proved that the latter implies the former. We prove that the converse\nis false: there are dimension expanders which are not quantum expanders.\nMoreover, this asymmetry is explained by the fact that there are two distinct\nlinear-algebraic analogues of graph edge expansion. The first of these is\nquantum edge expansion, which was introduced by Hastings, and which he proved\nto be equivalent to quantum expansion. We introduce a new notion, termed\ndimension edge expansion, which we prove is equivalent to dimension expansion\nand which is implied by quantum edge expansion. Thus, the separation above is\nimplied by a finer one: dimension edge expansion is strictly weaker than\nquantum edge expansion. This new notion also leads to a new, more modular proof\nof the Lubotzky--Zelmanov result that quantum expanders are dimension\nexpanders.",

    "abstract": "During X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning, metallic implants carrying\nwith patients often lead to adverse artifacts in the captured CT images and\nthen impair the clinical treatment. Against this metal artifact reduction (MAR)\ntask, the existing deep-learning-based methods have gained promising\nreconstruction performance. Nevertheless, there is still some room for further\nimprovement of MAR performance and generalization ability, since some important\nprior knowledge underlying this specific task has not been fully exploited.\nHereby, in this paper, we carefully analyze the characteristics of metal\nartifacts and propose an orientation-shared convolution representation strategy\nto adapt the physical prior structures of artifacts, i.e., rotationally\nsymmetrical streaking patterns. The proposed method rationally adopts\nFourier-series-expansion-based filter parametrization in artifact modeling,\nwhich can better separate artifacts from anatomical tissues and boost the model\ngeneralizability. Comprehensive experiments executed on synthesized and\nclinical datasets show the superiority of our method in detail preservation\nbeyond the current representative MAR methods.

    "abstract": "Neoplasms (NPs) and neurological diseases and disorders (NDDs) are amongst\nthe major classes of diseases underlying deaths of a disproportionate number of\npeople worldwide. To determine if there exist some distinctive features in the\nlocal wiring patterns of protein interactions emerging at the onset of a\ndisease belonging to either of these two classes, we examined 112 and 175\nprotein interaction networks belonging to NPs and NDDs, respectively. Orbit\nusage profiles (OUPs) for each of these networks were enumerated by\ninvestigating the networks' local topology. 56 non-redundant OUPs (nrOUPs) were\nderived and used as network features for classification between these two\ndisease classes. Four machine learning classifiers, namely, k-nearest neighbour\n(KNN), support vector machine (SVM), deep neural network (DNN), random forest\n(RF) were trained on these data. DNN obtained the greatest average AUPRC\n(0.988) among these classifiers. DNNs developed on node2vec and the proposed\nnrOUPs embeddings were compared using 5-fold cross validation on the basis of\naverage values of the six of performance measures, viz., AUPRC, Accuracy,\nSensitivity, Specificity, Precision and MCC. It was found that nrOUPs based\nclassifier performed better in all of these six performance measures.",

    "abstract": "The ensemble Kalman filter is widely used in applications because, for high\ndimensional filtering problems, it has a robustness that is not shared for\nexample by the particle filter; in particular it does not suffer from weight\ncollapse. However, there is no theory which quantifies its accuracy as an\napproximation of the true filtering distribution, except in the Gaussian\nsetting. To address this issue we provide the first analysis of the accuracy of\nthe ensemble Kalman filter beyond the Gaussian setting. Our analysis is\ndeveloped for the mean field ensemble Kalman filter. We rewrite this filter in\nterms of maps on probability measures, and then we prove that these maps are\nlocally Lipschitz in an appropriate weighted total variation metric. Using\nthese stability estimates we demonstrate that, if the true filtering\ndistribution is close to Gaussian after appropriate lifting to the joint space\nof state and data, then it is well approximated by the ensemble Kalman filter.\nFinally, we provide a generalization of these results to the Gaussian projected\nfilter, which can be viewed as a mean field description of the unscented Kalman\nfilter.",

    "title": "Learned Lossless Image Compression Through Interpolation With Low  Complexity",
    "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of deep learning in image processing, many\nlearned lossless image compression methods have been proposed recently. One\ngroup of algorithms that have shown good performance are based on learned\npixel-based auto-regressive models, however, their sequential nature prevents\neasily parallelized computations and leads to long decoding times. Another\npopular group of algorithms are based on scale-based auto-regressive models and\ncan provide competitive compression performance while also enabling simple\nparallelization and much shorter decoding times. However, their major drawback\nare the used large neural networks and high computational complexity. This\npaper presents an interpolation based learned lossless image compression method\nwhich falls in the scale-based auto-regressive models group. The method\nachieves better than or on par compression performance with the recent\nscale-based auto-regressive models, yet requires more than 10x less neural\nnetwork parameters and encoding/decoding computation complexity. These\nachievements are due to the contributions/findings in the overall system and\nneural network architecture design, such as sharing interpolator neural\nnetworks across different scales, using separate neural networks for different\nparameters of the probability distribution model and performing the processing\nin the YCoCg-R color space instead of the RGB color space.",
