    "abstract": "The high demand for fabricating microresonators with desired optical\nproperties has led to various techniques to optimize geometries, mode\nstructures, nonlinearities and dispersion. Depending on applications, the\ndispersion in such resonators counters their optical nonlinearities and\ninfluences the intracavity optical dynamics. In this paper, we demonstrate the\nuse of a machine learning (ML) algorithm as a tool to determine the geometry of\nmicroresonators from their dispersion profiles. The training dataset with ~460\nsamples is generated by finite element simulations and the model is\nexperimentally verified using integrated silicon nitride microresonators. Two\nML algorithms are compared along with suitable hyperparameter tuning, out of\nwhich Random Forest (RF) yields the best results. The average error on the\nsimulated data is well below 15%.",

However, these cogs need not be capable of full general artificial\nintelligence nor able to function in a stand-alone manner. Instead, cogs and\nhumans will work together in collaboration each compensating for the weaknesses\nof the other and together achieve synthetic expertise as an ensemble. This\npaper reviews the nature of expertise, the Expertise Level to describe the\nskills required of an expert, and knowledge stores required by an expert. By\ncollaboration, cogs augment human cognitive ability in a human/cog ensemble.\nThis paper introduces six Levels of Cognitive Augmentation to describe the\nbalance of cognitive processing in the human/cog ensemble. Because these cogs\nwill be available to the mass market via common devices and inexpensive\napplications, they will lead to the Democratization of Expertise and a new\ncognitive systems era promising to change how we live, work, and play. The\nfuture will belong to those best able to communicate, coordinate, and\ncollaborate with cognitive systems.",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning on edge is challenging due to on-device limited resources.\nExisting work addresses this issue by training a subset of parameters or adding\nmodel patches. Developed with inference in mind, Inverted Residual Blocks\n(IRBs) split a convolutional layer into depthwise and pointwise convolutions,\nleading to more stacking layers, e.g., convolution, normalization, and\nactivation layers. Though they are efficient for inference, IRBs require that\nadditional activation maps are stored in memory for training weights for\nconvolution layers and scales for normalization layers. As a result, their high\nmemory cost prohibits training IRBs on resource-limited edge devices, and\nmaking them unsuitable in the context of transfer learning. To address this\nissue, we present MobileTL, a memory and computationally efficient on-device\ntransfer learning method for models built with IRBs. MobileTL trains the shifts\nfor internal normalization layers to avoid storing activation maps for the\nbackward pass. Also, MobileTL approximates the backward computation of the\nactivation layer (e.g., Hard-Swish and ReLU6) as a signed function which\nenables storing a binary mask instead of activation maps for the backward pass.\nMobileTL fine-tunes a few top blocks (close to output) rather than propagating\nthe gradient through the whole network to reduce the computation cost. Our\nmethod reduces memory usage by 46% and 53% for MobileNetV2 and V3 IRBs,\nrespectively. For MobileNetV3, we observe a 36% reduction in floating-point\noperations (FLOPs) when fine-tuning 5 blocks, while only incurring a 0.6%\naccuracy reduction on CIFAR10. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets\ndemonstrate that our method is Pareto-optimal (best accuracy under given\nhardware constraints) compared to prior work in transfer learning for edge\ndevices.",

Experiments on a range of MiniGrid and Mujoco environments show that\npost-exploration indeed helps IMGEP agents reach more diverse states and boosts\ntheir performance.

Driven by this observation, we propose NeRDi, a single-view NeRF\nsynthesis framework with general image priors from 2D diffusion models.\nFormulating single-view reconstruction as an image-conditioned 3D generation\nproblem, we optimize the NeRF representations by minimizing a diffusion loss on\nits arbitrary view renderings with a pretrained image diffusion model under the\ninput-view constraint. We leverage off-the-shelf vision-language models and\nintroduce a two-section language guidance as conditioning inputs to the\ndiffusion model. This is essentially helpful for improving multiview content\ncoherence as it narrows down the general image prior conditioned on the\nsemantic and visual features of the single-view input image. Additionally, we\nintroduce a geometric loss based on estimated depth maps to regularize the\nunderlying 3D geometry of the NeRF.

    "abstract": "Whole slide images (WSI) are microscopy images of stained tissue slides\nroutinely prepared for diagnosis and treatment selection in medical practice.\nWSI are very large (gigapixel size) and complex (made of up to millions of\ncells). The current state-of-the-art (SoTA) approach to classify WSI subdivides\nthem into tiles, encodes them by pre-trained networks and applies Multiple\nInstance Learning (MIL) to train for specific downstream tasks. However,\nannotated datasets are often small, typically a few hundred to a few thousand\nWSI, which may cause overfitting and underperforming models. Conversely, the\nnumber of unannotated WSI is ever increasing, with datasets of tens of\nthousands (soon to be millions) of images available. While it has been\npreviously proposed to use these unannotated data to identify suitable tile\nrepresentations by self-supervised learning (SSL), downstream classification\ntasks still require full supervision because parts of the MIL architecture is\nnot trained during tile level SSL pre-training. Here, we propose a strategy of\nslide level SSL to leverage the large number of WSI without annotations to\ninfer powerful slide representations. Applying our method to The Cancer-Genome\nAtlas, one of the most widely used data resources in cancer research (16 TB\nimage data), we are able to downsize the dataset to 23 MB without any loss in\npredictive power: we show that a linear classifier trained on top of these\nembeddings maintains or improves previous SoTA performances on various\nbenchmark WSI classification tasks.

    "abstract": "Deformable image registration, i.e., the task of aligning multiple images\ninto one coordinate system by non-linear transformation, serves as an essential\npreprocessing step for neuroimaging data. Recent research on deformable image\nregistration is mainly focused on improving the registration accuracy using\nmulti-stage alignment methods, where the source image is repeatedly deformed in\nstages by a same neural network until it is well-aligned with the target image.\nConventional methods for multi-stage registration can often blur the source\nimage as the pixel/voxel values are repeatedly interpolated from the image\ngenerated by the previous stage. However, maintaining image quality such as\nsharpness during image registration is crucial to medical data analysis. In\nthis paper, we study the problem of anti-blur deformable image registration and\npropose a novel solution, called Anti-Blur Network (ABN), for multi-stage image\nregistration. Specifically, we use a pair of short-term registration and\nlong-term memory networks to learn the nonlinear deformations at each stage,\nwhere the short-term registration network learns how to improve the\nregistration accuracy incrementally and the long-term memory network combines\nall the previous deformations to allow an interpolation to perform on the raw\nimage directly and preserve image sharpness. Extensive experiments on both\nnatural and medical image datasets demonstrated that ABN can accurately\nregister images while preserving their sharpness.

    "abstract": "Current pre-trained language models have enabled remarkable improvements in\ndownstream tasks, but it remains difficult to distinguish effects of\nstatistical correlation from more systematic logical reasoning grounded on\nunderstanding of the real world. In this paper we tease these factors apart by\nleveraging counterfactual conditionals, which force language models to predict\nunusual consequences based on hypothetical propositions. We introduce a set of\ntests drawn from psycholinguistic experiments, as well as larger-scale\ncontrolled datasets, to probe counterfactual predictions from a variety of\npopular pre-trained language models. We find that models are consistently able\nto override real-world knowledge in counterfactual scenarios, and that this\neffect is more robust in case of stronger baseline world knowledge -- however,\nwe also find that for most models this effect appears largely to be driven by\nsimple lexical cues. When we mitigate effects of both world knowledge and\nlexical cues to test knowledge of linguistic nuances of counterfactuals, we\nfind that only GPT-3 shows sensitivity to these nuances, though this\nsensitivity is also non-trivially impacted by lexical associative factors.",

Apart from automotive safety, 5G NR further bring new\ncapabilities to C-V2X for autonomous driving, such as real-time local update,\nand coordinated driving. These capabilities rely on the provision of low\nlatency and high reliability from 5G NR. Among them, a basic demand is\nbroadcasting or multicasting environment update messages, such as cooperative\nperception data, with high reliability and low latency from a Road Side Unit\n(RSU) or a base station (BS). In other words, broadcasting multiple types of\nautomotive messages with high reliability and low latency is one of the key\nissues in 5G NR C-V2X. In this work, we consider how to select Modulation and\nCoding Scheme (MCS), RSU/BS, Forward Error Correction (FEC) code rate, to\nmaximize the system utility, which is a function of message delivery\nreliability. We formulate the optimization problem as a nonlinear integer\nprogramming problem. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard, we propose an\napproximation algorithm, referred to as the Hyperbolic Successive Convex\nApproximation (HSCA) algorithm, which uses the successive convex approximation\nto find the optimal solution. In our simulations, we compare the performance of\nHSCA with those of three algorithms respectively, including the baseline\nalgorithm, the heuristic algorithm, and the optimal solution.

We propose channel evaluation using orthogonal pilot reuse\nsequences (PRS) and zero forced (ZF) pre-coding techniques to eliminate channel\nquality in end users with poor channel quality based on channel evaluation,\nlarge-scale shutdown evaluation, and analysis of maximum transmission\nefficiency. We derived the lower bounds on the downlink data rate (DR) and\nsignal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) that can be achieved based on PRS\nassignment to a group of users where the number of antenna elements mitigated\nthe interference when the number of antennas reaches infinity. The channel\ncoherence interval limitation, the orthogonal PRS cannot be allocated to all\nUEs in each cell. The short coherence intervals able to reduce the PC and\nimprove the quality of channel. The results of the modelling showed that higher\nDR can be achieved due to better channel evaluation and lower loss.",

An efficient technique to lessen this problem is to use caching i.e. to\nbring the data closer to the users by making use of the caches of edge network\nnodes, such as fixed or mobile access points and even user devices. The\nperformance of a caching depends on contents that are cached. In this paper, we\nexamine the problem of content caching at the wireless edge(i.e. base stations)\nto minimize the discounted cost incurred over infinite horizon.

    "abstract": "Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) constitutes a key service\nclass of the fifth generation and beyond cellular networks. Notably, designing\nand supporting URLLC poses a herculean task due to the fundamental need of\nidentifying and accurately characterizing the underlying statistical models in\nwhich the system operates, e.g., interference statistics, channel conditions,\nand the behavior of protocols. In general, multi-layer end-to-end approaches\nconsidering all the potential delay and error sources and proper statistical\ntools and methodologies are inevitably required for providing strong\nreliability and latency guarantees. This paper contributes to the body of\nknowledge in the latter aspect by providing a tutorial on several statistical\ntools and methodologies that are useful for designing and analyzing URLLC\nsystems. Specifically, we overview the frameworks related to i) reliability\ntheory, ii) short packet communications, iii) inequalities, distribution\nbounds, tail approximations, and risk-assessment tools, iv) rare events\nsimulation, v) large-scale tools such as stochastic geometry, clustering,\ncompressed sensing, and mean-field games, vi) queuing theory and information\nfreshness, and vii) machine learning. Throughout the paper, we briefly review\nthe state-of-the-art works using the addressed tools and methodologies, and\ntheir link to URLLC systems. Moreover, we discuss novel application examples\nfocused on physical and medium access control layers. Finally, key research\nchallenges and directions are highlighted to elucidate how URLLC\nanalysis/design research may evolve in the coming years.",

We\nextend our approach to further text-to-shape tasks including text-conditioned\nshape completion and manipulation.

It is\ncomposed of millions of virtual fibers, encoded as 3D polylines, which\napproximate the white matter axonal pathways. To date, tractograms are the most\naccurate white matter representation and thus are used for tasks like\npresurgical planning and investigations of neuroplasticity, brain disorders, or\nbrain networks. However, it is a well-known issue that a large portion of\ntractogram fibers is not anatomically plausible and can be considered artifacts\nof the tracking procedure. With Verifyber, we tackle the problem of filtering\nout such non-plausible fibers using a novel fully-supervised learning approach.\nDifferently from other approaches based on signal reconstruction and/or brain\ntopology regularization, we guide our method with the existing anatomical\nknowledge of the white matter. Using tractograms annotated according to\nanatomical principles, we train our model, Verifyber, to classify fibers as\neither anatomically plausible or non-plausible. The proposed Verifyber model is\nan original Geometric Deep Learning method that can deal with variable size\nfibers, while being invariant to fiber orientation. Our model considers each\nfiber as a graph of points, and by learning features of the edges between\nconsecutive points via the proposed sequence Edge Convolution, it can capture\nthe underlying anatomical properties. The output filtering results highly\naccurate and robust across an extensive set of experiments, and fast; with a\n12GB GPU, filtering a tractogram of 1M fibers requires less than a minute.\nVerifyber implementation and trained models are available at\nhttps://github.com/FBK-NILab/verifyber.",

    "abstract": "Brain extraction and registration are important preprocessing steps in\nneuroimaging data analysis, where the goal is to extract the brain regions from\nMRI scans (i.e., extraction step) and align them with a target brain image\n(i.e., registration step). Conventional research mainly focuses on developing\nmethods for the extraction and registration tasks separately under supervised\nsettings. The performance of these methods highly depends on the amount of\ntraining samples and visual inspections performed by experts for error\ncorrection. However, in many medical studies, collecting voxel-level labels and\nconducting manual quality control in high-dimensional neuroimages (e.g., 3D\nMRI) are very expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, brain extraction and\nregistration are highly related tasks in neuroimaging data and should be solved\ncollectively. In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised collective\nextraction and registration in neuroimaging data. We propose a unified\nend-to-end framework, called ERNet (Extraction-Registration Network), to\njointly optimize the extraction and registration tasks, allowing feedback\nbetween them. Specifically, we use a pair of multi-stage extraction and\nregistration modules to learn the extraction mask and transformation, where the\nextraction network improves the extraction accuracy incrementally and the\nregistration network successively warps the extracted image until it is\nwell-aligned with the target image. Experiment results on real-world datasets\nshow that our proposed method can effectively improve the performance on\nextraction and registration tasks in neuroimaging data.

To resolve such conflicts,\nassigning importance ranking to rules (i.e., imposing a rule hierarchy) has\nbeen proposed, which, in turn, induces rankings on trajectories based on the\nimportance of the rules they satisfy. On one hand, imposing rule hierarchies\ncan enhance interpretability, but introduce combinatorial complexity to\nplanning; while on the other hand, differentiable reward structures can be\nleveraged by modern gradient-based optimization tools, but are less\ninterpretable and unintuitive to tune. In this paper, we present an approach to\nequivalently express rule hierarchies as differentiable reward structures\namenable to modern gradient-based optimizers, thereby, achieving the best of\nboth worlds. We achieve this by formulating rank-preserving reward functions\nthat are monotonic in the rank of the trajectories induced by the rule\nhierarchy; i.e., higher ranked trajectories receive higher reward. Equipped\nwith a rule hierarchy and its corresponding rank-preserving reward function, we\ndevelop a two-stage planner that can efficiently resolve conflicting planning\nrequirements.

    "title": "Enhancing Low-Density EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces with  Similarity-Keeping Knowledge Distillation",
    "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been one of the common neuromonitoring\nmodalities for real-world brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) because of its\nnon-invasiveness, low cost, and high temporal resolution. Recently,\nlight-weight and portable EEG wearable devices based on low-density montages\nhave increased the convenience and usability of BCI applications. However, loss\nof EEG decoding performance is often inevitable due to reduced number of\nelectrodes and coverage of scalp regions of a low-density EEG montage. To\naddress this issue, we introduce knowledge distillation (KD), a learning\nmechanism developed for transferring knowledge/information between neural\nnetwork models, to enhance the performance of low-density EEG decoding. Our\nframework includes a newly proposed similarity-keeping (SK) teacher-student KD\nscheme that encourages a low-density EEG student model to acquire the\ninter-sample similarity as in a pre-trained teacher model trained on\nhigh-density EEG data. The experimental results validate that our SK-KD\nframework consistently improves motor-imagery EEG decoding accuracy when number\nof electrodes deceases for the input EEG data. For both common low-density\nheadphone-like and headband-like montages, our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art KD methods across various EEG decoding model architectures. As\nthe first KD scheme developed for enhancing EEG decoding, we foresee the\nproposed SK-KD framework to facilitate the practicality of low-density\nEEG-based BCI in real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Classifiers in supervised learning have various security and privacy issues,\ne.g., 1) data poisoning attacks, backdoor attacks, and adversarial examples on\nthe security side as well as 2) inference attacks and the right to be forgotten\nfor the training data on the privacy side. Various secure and\nprivacy-preserving supervised learning algorithms with formal guarantees have\nbeen proposed to address these issues. However, they suffer from various\nlimitations such as accuracy loss, small certified security guarantees, and/or\ninefficiency. Self-supervised learning is an emerging technique to pre-train\nencoders using unlabeled data. Given a pre-trained encoder as a feature\nextractor, supervised learning can train a simple yet accurate classifier using\na small amount of labeled training data. In this work, we perform the first\nsystematic, principled measurement study to understand whether and when a\npre-trained encoder can address the limitations of secure or privacy-preserving\nsupervised learning algorithms. Our key findings are that a pre-trained encoder\nsubstantially improves 1) both accuracy under no attacks and certified security\nguarantees against data poisoning and backdoor attacks of state-of-the-art\nsecure learning algorithms (i.e., bagging and KNN), 2) certified security\nguarantees of randomized smoothing against adversarial examples without\nsacrificing its accuracy under no attacks, 3) accuracy of differentially\nprivate classifiers, and 4) accuracy and/or efficiency of exact machine\nunlearning.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Man\\v{c}inska and Roberson proved that two graphs $G$ and $G'$ are\nquantum isomorphic if and only if they admit the same number of homomorphisms\nfrom all planar graphs. We extend this result to planar #CSP with any pair of\nsets $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{F}'$ of real-valued, arbitrary arity\nconstraint functions. Graph homomorphism is the special case where each of\n$\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{F}'$ contain a single symmetric 0-1 valued binary\nconstraint function. Our treatment uses the framework of planar Holant\nproblems. To prove that quantum isomorphic constraint function sets give the\nsame value on any planar #CSP instance, we apply a novel form of holographic\ntransformation of Valiant, using the magic unitary matrix over a $C^*$-algebra\ndefining the quantum isomorphism. Due to the $C^*$-algebra's noncommutativity,\nit turns out that this form of holographic transformation is only applicable to\nplanar Holant. To prove the converse, we introduce the quantum automorphism\ngroup $\\text{Qut}(\\mathcal{F})$ of a set of constraint functions/tensors\n$\\mathcal{F}$, and characterize the intertwiners of $\\text{Qut}(\\mathcal{F})$\nas the signature matrices of planar $\\text{Holant}(\\mathcal{F} \\mid\n\\mathcal{EQ})$ quantum gadgets. Then we define a new notion of (projective)\nconnectivity for constraint functions and reduce arity while preserving the\nquantum automorphism group. Finally, to address the challenges posed by\ngeneralizing from 0-1 valued to real-valued constraint functions, we adapt a\ntechnique of Lov\\'asz in the classical setting for isomorphisms of\nreal-weighted graphs to the setting of quantum isomorphisms.",

    "title": "Semantically Enhanced Global Reasoning for Semantic Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in pixel-level tasks (e.g., segmentation) illustrate the\nbenefit of long-range interactions between aggregated region-based\nrepresentations that can enhance local features. However, such pixel-to-region\nassociations and the resulting representation, which often take the form of\nattention, cannot model the underlying semantic structure of the scene (e.g.,\nindividual objects and, by extension, their interactions). In this work, we\ntake a step toward addressing this limitation. Specifically, we propose an\narchitecture where we learn to project image features into latent region\nrepresentations and perform global reasoning across them, using a transformer,\nto produce contextualized and scene-consistent representations that are then\nfused with original pixel-level features. Our design enables the latent regions\nto represent semantically meaningful concepts, by ensuring that activated\nregions are spatially disjoint and unions of such regions correspond to\nconnected object segments. The resulting semantic global reasoning (SGR) is\nend-to-end trainable and can be combined with any semantic segmentation\nframework and backbone. Combining SGR with DeepLabV3 results in a semantic\nsegmentation performance that is competitive to the state-of-the-art, while\nresulting in more semantically interpretable and diverse region\nrepresentations, which we show can effectively transfer to detection and\ninstance segmentation. Further, we propose a new metric that allows us to\nmeasure the semantics of representations at both the object class and instance\nlevel.",

We show that for any set of beliefs about future asset\nprices, there exists an optimal CFMM trading function that maximizes the\nfraction of trades that a CFMM can settle. This trading function is the optimal\nsolution of a convex program. This program therefore gives a tractable\nframework for market-makers to compile their belief-distribution on the future\nprices of the underlying assets into the trading function of a maximally\ncapital-efficient CFMM. Our optimization framework further extends to capture\nthe tradeoffs between fee revenue, arbitrage loss, and opportunity costs of\nliquidity providers. Analyzing the program shows how consideration of profit\nand loss qualitatively distort the optimal liquidity allocation.\nOur model additionally explains the diversity of CFMM designs that appear in\npractice. We show that careful analysis of our convex program enables inference\nof a market-maker's beliefs about future asset prices, and show that these\nbeliefs mirror the folklore intuition for several widely used CFMMs. Developing\nthe program requires a new notion of the liquidity of a CFMM at any price\npoint, and the core technical challenge is in the analysis of the KKT\nconditions of an optimization over an infinite-dimensional Banach space.",

This implies that\nfor every semilinear trio (where these properties are effective), it is\npossible to decide containment, equivalence, and disjointness concerning its\nbounded languages. A condition is also provided for when the bounded languages\nin a semilinear trio coincide exactly with those accepted by DCM machines, and\nit is used to show that many grammar systems of finite index -- such as\nfinite-index matrix grammars and finite-index ETOL -- have identical bounded\nlanguages as DCM.\nThen connections between ambiguity, counting regularity, and commutative\nregularity are made, as many machines and grammars that are unambiguous can\nonly generate/accept counting regular or commutatively regular languages. Thus,\nsuch a system that can generate/accept a non-counting regular or\nnon-commutatively regular language implies the existence of inherently\nambiguous languages over that system.

Existing methods either operate on a global latent code,\nwhich limits the expressiveness of their model, or autoregressively estimate\nthe local features, which is highly computationally extensive. Instead, our\nmethod estimates the entire local feature field by a single feedforward network\nby formulating this problem as a tensor completion problem on the feature\nvolume of the object. Due to the redundancy of local feature volumes, this\ntensor completion problem can be further reduced to estimating the canonical\nfactors of the feature volume. A hierarchical variational autoencoder (VAE)\nwith tiny MLPs is used to probabilistically estimate the canonical factors of\nthe complete feature volume. The effectiveness of the proposed method is\nvalidated by comparing it with the state-of-the-art method quantitatively and\nqualitatively.

However, a parallel trend has been to train machine\nlearning models in collaboration with other data holders without accessing\ntheir data.

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of a system is important in many scientific and\nengineering domains. This problem can be approached by learning state\ntransition rules from observations using machine learning techniques. Such\nobserved time-series data often consist of sequences of many continuous\nvariables with noise and ambiguity, but we often need rules of dynamics that\ncan be modeled with a few essential variables. In this work, we propose a\nmethod for extracting a small number of essential hidden variables from\nhigh-dimensional time-series data and for learning state transition rules\nbetween these hidden variables. The proposed method is based on the Restricted\nBoltzmann Machine (RBM), which treats observable data in the visible layer and\nlatent features in the hidden layer. However, real-world data, such as video\nand audio, include both discrete and continuous variables, and these variables\nhave temporal relationships. Therefore, we propose Recurrent Temporal\nGaussianBernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RTGB-RBM), which combines\nGaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine (GB-RBM) to handle continuous\nvisible variables, and Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RT-RBM)\nto capture time dependence between discrete hidden variables. We also propose a\nrule-based method that extracts essential information as hidden variables and\nrepresents state transition rules in interpretable form. We conduct experiments\non Bouncing Ball and Moving MNIST datasets to evaluate our proposed method.\nExperimental results show that our method can learn the dynamics of those\nphysical systems as state transition rules between hidden variables and can\npredict unobserved future states from observed state transitions.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the probability of failure for complex real-world systems using\nhigh-fidelity computational models is often prohibitively expensive, especially\nwhen the probability is small. Exploiting low-fidelity models can make this\nprocess more feasible, but merging information from multiple low-fidelity and\nhigh-fidelity models poses several challenges. This paper presents a robust\nmulti-fidelity surrogate modeling strategy in which the multi-fidelity\nsurrogate is assembled using an active learning strategy using an on-the-fly\nmodel adequacy assessment set within a subset simulation framework for\nefficient reliability analysis. The multi-fidelity surrogate is assembled by\nfirst applying a Gaussian process correction to each low-fidelity model and\nassigning a model probability based on the model's local predictive accuracy\nand cost. Three strategies are proposed to fuse these individual surrogates\ninto an overall surrogate model based on model averaging and\ndeterministic/stochastic model selection. The strategies also dictate which\nmodel evaluations are necessary. No assumptions are made about the\nrelationships between low-fidelity models, while the high-fidelity model is\nassumed to be the most accurate and most computationally expensive model.\nThrough two analytical and two numerical case studies, including a case study\nevaluating the failure probability of Tristructural isotropic-coated (TRISO)\nnuclear fuels, the algorithm is shown to be highly accurate while drastically\nreducing the number of high-fidelity model calls (and hence computational\ncost).",

A robust and efficient HAR system has a pivotal role in fields like\nvideo surveillance, crowd behavior analysis, sports analysis, and\nhuman-computer interaction. What makes it challenging are the complex poses,\nunderstanding different viewpoints, and the environmental scenarios where the\naction is taking place. To address such complexities, in this paper, we propose\na novel Sparse Weighted Temporal Attention (SWTA) module to utilize sparsely\nsampled video frames for obtaining global weighted temporal attention. The\nproposed SWTA is comprised of two parts. First, temporal segment network that\nsparsely samples a given set of frames. Second, weighted temporal attention,\nwhich incorporates a fusion of attention maps derived from optical flow, with\nraw RGB images. This is followed by a basenet network, which comprises a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) module along with fully connected layers\nthat provide us with activity recognition. The SWTA network can be used as a\nplug-in module to the existing deep CNN architectures, for optimizing them to\nlearn temporal information by eliminating the need for a separate temporal\nstream. It has been evaluated on three publicly available benchmark datasets,\nnamely Okutama, MOD20, and Drone-Action.

    "abstract": "Novel artificial intelligence (AI) technology has expedited various\nscientific research, e.g., cosmology, physics and bioinformatics, inevitably\nbecoming a significant category of workload on high performance computing (HPC)\nsystems. Existing AI benchmarks tend to customize well-recognized AI\napplications, so as to evaluate the AI performance of HPC systems under\npredefined problem size, in terms of datasets and AI models. Due to lack of\nscalability on the problem size, static AI benchmarks might be under competent\nto help understand the performance trend of evolving AI applications on HPC\nsystems, in particular, the scientific AI applications on large-scale systems.\nIn this paper, we propose a scalable evaluation methodology (SAIH) for\nanalyzing the AI performance trend of HPC systems with scaling the problem\nsizes of customized AI applications. To enable scalability, SAIH builds a set\nof novel mechanisms for augmenting problem sizes. As the data and model\nconstantly scale, we can investigate the trend and range of AI performance on\nHPC systems, and further diagnose system bottlenecks. To verify our\nmethodology, we augment a cosmological AI application to evaluate a real HPC\nsystem equipped with GPUs as a case study of SAIH.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we empirically analyze a simple, non-learnable, and\nnonparametric Nadaraya-Watson (NW) prediction head that can be used with any\nneural network architecture. In the NW head, the prediction is a weighted\naverage of labels from a support set. The weights are computed from distances\nbetween the query feature and support features. This is in contrast to the\ndominant approach of using a learnable classification head (e.g., a\nfully-connected layer) on the features, which can be challenging to interpret\nand can yield poorly calibrated predictions. Our empirical results on an array\nof computer vision tasks demonstrate that the NW head can yield better\ncalibration than its parametric counterpart, while having comparable accuracy\nand with minimal computational overhead. To further increase inference-time\nefficiency, we propose a simple approach that involves a clustering step run on\nthe training set to create a relatively small distilled support set. In\naddition to using the weights as a means of interpreting model predictions, we\nfurther present an easy-to-compute \"support influence function,\" which\nquantifies the influence of a support element on the prediction for a given\nquery. As we demonstrate in our experiments, the influence function can allow\nthe user to debug a trained model.

    "abstract": "Emerging real-time multi-model ML (RTMM) workloads such as AR/VR and drone\ncontrol often involve dynamic behaviors in various levels; task, model, and\nlayers (or, ML operators) within a model. Such dynamic behaviors are new\nchallenges to the system software in an ML system because the overall system\nload is unpredictable unlike traditional ML workloads. Also, the real-time\nprocessing requires to meet deadlines, and multi-model workloads involve highly\nheterogeneous models. As RTMM workloads often run on resource-constrained\ndevices (e.g., VR headset), developing an effective scheduler is an important\nresearch problem.\nTherefore, we propose a new scheduler, SDRM3, that effectively handles\nvarious dynamicity in RTMM style workloads targeting multi-accelerator systems.\nTo make scheduling decisions, SDRM3 quantifies the unique requirements for RTMM\nworkloads and utilizes the quantified scores to drive scheduling decisions,\nconsidering the current system load and other inference jobs on different\nmodels and input frames. SDRM3 has tunable parameters that provide fast\nadaptivity to dynamic workload changes based on a gradient descent-like online\noptimization, which typically converges within five steps for new workloads. In\naddition, we also propose a method to exploit model level dynamicity based on\nSupernet for exploiting the trade-off between the scheduling effectiveness and\nmodel performance (e.g., accuracy), which dynamically selects a proper\nsub-network in a Supernet based on the system loads.\nIn our evaluation on five realistic RTMM workload scenarios, SDRM3 reduces\nthe overall UXCost, which is a energy-delay-product (EDP)-equivalent metric for\nreal-time applications defined in the paper, by 37.7% and 53.2% on geometric\nmean (up to 97.6% and 97.1%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines, which\nshows the efficacy of our scheduling methodology.",

In this paper, we propose Slimmable Pruned Neural\nNetworks (SP-Net), which has sub-network structures learned by pruning instead\nof adopting structures with the same proportion of channels in each layer\n(width multiplier) like S-Net, and we also propose new pruning procedures:\nmulti-base pruning instead of one-shot or iterative pruning to realize high\naccuracy and huge training time saving.

    "abstract": "Soft actuators have attracted a great deal of interest in the context of\nrehabilitative and assistive robots for increasing safety and lowering costs as\ncompared to rigid-body robotic systems. During actuation, soft actuators\nexperience high levels of deformation, which can lead to microscale fractures\nin their elastomeric structure, which fatigues the system over time and\neventually leads to macroscale damages and eventually failure. This paper\nreports finite element modeling (FEM) of pneu-nets at high angles, along with\nrepetitive experimentation at high deformation rates, in order to study the\neffect and behavior of fatigue in soft robotic actuators, which would result in\ndeviation from the ideal behavior. Comparing the FEM model and experimental\ndata, we show that FEM can model the performance of the actuator before fatigue\nto a bending angle of 167 degrees with ~96% accuracy. We also show that the FEM\nmodel performance will drop to 80% due to fatigue after repetitive high-angle\nbending. The results of this paper objectively highlight the emergence of\nfatigue over cyclic activation of the system and the resulting deviation from\nthe computational FEM model. Such behavior can be considered in future\ncontrollers to adapt the system with time-variable and non-autonomous response\ndynamics of soft robots.",

This inspires us to explore whether\nartificial intelligence could evolve and discover a similar colour-naming\nsystem via optimising the communication efficiency represented by high-level\nrecognition performance. Here, we propose a novel colour quantisation\ntransformer, CQFormer, that quantises colour space while maintaining the\naccuracy of machine recognition on the quantised images. Given an RGB image,\nAnnotation Branch maps it into an index map before generating the quantised\nimage with a colour palette, meanwhile the Palette Branch utilises a key-point\ndetection way to find proper colours in palette among whole colour space. By\ninteracting with colour annotation, CQFormer is able to balance both the\nmachine vision accuracy and colour perceptual structure such as distinct and\nstable colour distribution for discovered colour system. Very interestingly, we\neven observe the consistent evolution pattern between our artificial colour\nsystem and basic colour terms across human languages. Besides, our colour\nquantisation method also offers an efficient quantisation method that\neffectively compresses the image storage while maintaining a high performance\nin high-level recognition tasks such as classification and detection.

    "abstract": "In most cases, bilingual TTS needs to handle three types of input scripts:\nfirst language only, second language only, and second language embedded in the\nfirst language. In the latter two situations, the pronunciation and intonation\nof the second language are usually quite different due to the influence of the\nfirst language. Therefore, it is a big challenge to accurately model the\npronunciation and intonation of the second language in different contexts\nwithout mutual interference. This paper builds a Mandarin-English TTS system to\nacquire more standard spoken English speech from a monolingual Chinese speaker.\nWe introduce phonology embedding to capture the English differences between\ndifferent phonology. Embedding mask is applied to language embedding for\ndistinguishing information between different languages and to phonology\nembedding for focusing on English expression. We specially design an embedding\nstrength modulator to capture the dynamic strength of language and phonology.\nExperiments show that our approach can produce significantly more natural and\nstandard spoken English speech of the monolingual Chinese speaker.

Automatic UI code generation from UI design\ndraft dramatically simplifies the development process. However, the nesting\nlayer structure in the design draft affects the quality and usability of the\ngenerated code. Few existing GUI automated techniques detect and group the\nnested layers to improve the accessibility of generated code. In this paper, we\nproposed our UI Layers Group Detector as a vision-based method that\nautomatically detects images (i.e., basic shapes and visual elements) and text\nlayers that present the same semantic meanings. We propose two plug-in\ncomponents, text fusion and box attention, that utilize text information from\ndesign drafts as a priori information for group localization. We construct a\nlarge-scale UI dataset for training and testing, and present a data\naugmentation approach to boost the detection performance.

    "abstract": "Ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is one of three major\napplication scenarios of the 5G new radio, which has strict latency and\nreliability requirements. Contention-based grant-free (GF) access protocols,\nsuch as Reactive, K-Repetition, and Proactive, have been proposed for uplink\nURLLC service. In the GF access, user equipment (UE) resends packet immediately\nafter an unsuccessful transmission such that the latency requirement can be\nsatisfied. Taking Reactive as an example, this paper studies the impact of 1-\npersistent retransmission (1-pR) on the distribution of user-plane delay. We\ndefine the number of UEs that try to send packets in each mini-slot as attempt\nrate. We show that the 1-pR makes the attempt rate seen by the packet in\nretransmission larger than that seen by the packet in the first transmission.\nAs a result, the successful probability of retransmission is lower than that of\nthe first transmission. Based on this observation, we derive the distribution\nof user-plane delay, which also takes into account the delay incurred by\nqueueing process. We demonstrate that whether to include the effect of 1-pR and\nqueueing process in the analysis would have a significant impact on the\nprediction accuracy of delay distribution.",

    "abstract": "Geometric deep learning has recently achieved great success in non-Euclidean\ndomains, and learning on 3D structures of large biomolecules is emerging as a\ndistinct research area. However, its efficacy is largely constrained due to the\nlimited quantity of structural data. Meanwhile, protein language models trained\non substantial 1D sequences have shown burgeoning capabilities with scale in a\nbroad range of applications. Nevertheless, no preceding studies consider\ncombining these different protein modalities to promote the representation\npower of geometric neural networks. To address this gap, we make the foremost\nstep to integrate the knowledge learned by well-trained protein language models\ninto several state-of-the-art geometric networks. Experiments are evaluated on\na variety of protein representation learning benchmarks, including\nprotein-protein interface prediction, model quality assessment, protein-protein\nrigid-body docking, and binding affinity prediction, leading to an overall\nimprovement of 20% over baselines and the new state-of-the-art performance.\nStrong evidence indicates that the incorporation of protein language models'\nknowledge enhances geometric networks' capacity by a significant margin and can\nbe generalized to complex tasks.",

    "abstract": "Node classification for graph-structured data aims to classify nodes whose\nlabels are unknown. While studies on static graphs are prevalent, few studies\nhave focused on dynamic graph node classification. Node classification on\ndynamic graphs is challenging for two reasons. First, the model needs to\ncapture both structural and temporal information, particularly on dynamic\ngraphs with a long history and require large receptive fields. Second, model\nscalability becomes a significant concern as the size of the dynamic graph\nincreases. To address these problems, we propose the Time Augmented Dynamic\nGraph Neural Network (TADGNN) framework. TADGNN consists of two modules: 1) a\ntime augmentation module that captures the temporal evolution of nodes across\ntime structurally, creating a time-augmented spatio-temporal graph, and 2) an\ninformation propagation module that learns the dynamic representations for each\nnode across time using the constructed time-augmented graph. We perform node\nclassification experiments on four dynamic graph benchmarks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that TADGNN framework outperforms several static and\ndynamic state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN models while demonstrating superior\nscalability. We also conduct theoretical and empirical analyses to validate the\nefficiency of the proposed method. Our code is available at\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/tadgnn.",

    "title": "Partial gathering of mobile agents in dynamic rings",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the partial gathering problem of mobile agents in\nsynchronous dynamic bidirectional ring networks. When k agents are distributed\nin the network, the partial gathering problem requires, for a given positive\ninteger g (< k), that agents terminate in a configuration such that either at\nleast g agents or no agent exists at each node. So far, the partial gathering\nproblem has been considered in static graphs. In this paper, we start\nconsidering partial gathering in dynamic graphs. As a first step, we consider\nthis problem in 1-interval connected rings, that is, one of the links in a ring\nmay be missing at each time step. In such networks, focusing on the\nrelationship between the values of k and g, we fully characterize the\nsolvability of the partial gathering problem and analyze the move complexity of\nthe proposed algorithms when the problem can be solved. First, we show that the\ng-partial gathering problem is unsolvable when k <= 2g. Second, we show that\nthe problem can be solved with O(n log g) time and the total number of O(gn log\ng) moves when 2g + 1 <= k <= 3g - 2. Third, we show that the problem can be\nsolved with O(n) time and the total number of O(kn) moves when 3g - 1 <= k <=\n8g - 4. Notice that since k = O(g) holds when 3g - 1 <= k <= 8g - 4, the move\ncomplexity O(kn) in this case can be represented also as O(gn). Finally, we\nshow that the problem can be solved with O(n) time and the total number of\nO(gn) moves when k >= 8g - 3. These results mean that the partial gathering\nproblem can be solved also in dynamic rings when k >= 2g + 1. In addition,\nagents require a total number of \\Omega(gn) moves to solve the partial (resp.,\ntotal) gathering problem. Thus, when k >= 3g - 1, agents can solve the partial\ngathering problem with the asymptotically optimal total number of O(gn) moves.",

    "abstract": "Tens of thousands of engineers use Sourcegraph day-to-day to search for code\nand rely on it to make progress on software development tasks. We face a key\nchallenge in designing a query language that accommodates the needs of a broad\nspectrum of users. Our experience shows that users express different and often\ncontradictory preferences for how queries should be interpreted. These\npreferences stem from users with differing usage contexts, technical\nexperience, and implicit expectations from using prior tools. At the same time,\ndesigning a code search query language poses unique challenges because it\nintersects traditional search engines and full-fledged programming languages.\nFor example, code search queries adopt certain syntactic conventions in the\ninterest of simplicity and terseness but invariably risk encoding implicit\nsemantics that are ambiguous at face-value (a single space in a query could\nmean three or more semantically different things depending on surrounding\nterms). Users often need to disambiguate intent with additional syntax so that\na query expresses what they actually want to search. This need to disambiguate\nis one of the primary frustrations we've seen users experience with writing\nsearch queries in the last three years. We share our observations that lead us\nto a fresh perspective where code search behavior can straddle seemingly\nambiguous queries. We develop Automated Query Evaluation (AQE), a new technique\nthat automatically generates and adaptively runs alternative query\ninterpretations in frustration-prone conditions. We evaluate AQE with an A/B\ntest across more than 10,000 unique users on our publicly-available code search\ninstance. Our main result shows that relative to the control group, users are\non average 22% more likely to click on a search result at all on any given day\nwhen AQE is active.",

Motivated by biological findings that the amplitude spectrum (AS) and\nphase spectrum (PS) in the frequency domain play different roles in the\nanimal's vision system, we observe that PS, which captures more semantic\ninformation, can increase the robustness of DNNs to label noise, more so than\nAS can.

Containerization allows us to easily deploy\neven complex data analysis pipelines (e.g, genomics, image analysis) across\nmultiple sites in a secure and scalable manner. We discuss the underlying\ntechnological concepts, security models, and governance processes. The\nimplementation has been successfully applied to distributed analyses of\nlarge-scale data, including applications of deep neural networks to medical\nimage data.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents SimVTP: a Simple Video-Text Pretraining framework via\nmasked autoencoders. We randomly mask out the spatial-temporal tubes of input\nvideo and the word tokens of input text and then feed them into a unified\nautencoder to reconstruct the missing pixels and words. Our SimVTP has several\nproperties: 1) Thanks to the unified autoencoder, SimVTP reconstructs the\nmasked signal of one modality with the help from another modality, which\nimplicitly learns the cross-modal alignment between video tubes and text\ntokens. 2) SimVTP not only benefits from a high video masking ratio (e.g. 90%)\ndue to the temporal redundancy of video, but also needs a high text masking\nratio (e.g. 75%), which is much higher than BERT (e.g. 15%), to achieve optimal\nperformance. This is because the aid of video modality makes text\nreconstruction less challenging, which thus needs a higher mask ratio to make\nthe pretext harder for useful feature learning. 3) Equipping SimVTP with\nvideo-text contrastive learning (VTC) and video-text matching (VTM), which are\ntwo commonly used cross-modal training strategies, could further improve the\ntransferable performance significantly. 4) SimVTP is dataefficent, e.g.,\npre-training only on 10% data of WebVid-2M, SimVTP achieves surprisingly good\nresults (43.8 R@1) on MSRVTT, which is far above recent state-of-the-art\nmethods pre-trained on both CC3M and WebVid-2M.

    "title": "A Generative Approach for Script Event Prediction via Contrastive  Fine-tuning",
    "abstract": "Script event prediction aims to predict the subsequent event given the\ncontext. This requires the capability to infer the correlations between events.\nRecent works have attempted to improve event correlation reasoning by using\npretrained language models and incorporating external knowledge~(e.g.,\ndiscourse relations). Though promising results have been achieved, some\nchallenges still remain. First, the pretrained language models adopted by\ncurrent works ignore event-level knowledge, resulting in an inability to\ncapture the correlations between events well. Second, modeling correlations\nbetween events with discourse relations is limited because it can only capture\nexplicit correlations between events with discourse markers, and cannot capture\nmany implicit correlations. To this end, we propose a novel generative approach\nfor this task, in which a pretrained language model is fine-tuned with an\nevent-centric pretraining objective and predicts the next event within a\ngenerative paradigm. Specifically, we first introduce a novel event-level blank\ninfilling strategy as the learning objective to inject event-level knowledge\ninto the pretrained language model, and then design a likelihood-based\ncontrastive loss for fine-tuning the generative model. Instead of using an\nadditional prediction layer, we perform prediction by using sequence\nlikelihoods generated by the generative model. Our approach models correlations\nbetween events in a soft way without any external knowledge. The\nlikelihood-based prediction eliminates the need to use additional networks to\nmake predictions and is somewhat interpretable since it scores each word in the\nevent. Experimental results on the multi-choice narrative cloze~(MCNC) task\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves better results than other\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

It has received significant attention from the autonomous vehicle\nresearch community due to its strong potential to significantly enhance fuel\nefficiency, driving safety, and driver comfort. Despite these advantages,\nrecent research has revealed a detrimental effect of the extremely small\nintra-platoon gap on traffic flow for highway on-ramp merging. While existing\ncontrol-based methods allow for adaptation of the intra-platoon gap to improve\ntraffic flow, making an optimal control decision under the complex dynamics of\ntraffic conditions remains a significant challenge due to the massive\ncomputational complexity. To this end, we present the design, implementation,\nand evaluation of a novel reinforcement learning framework that adaptively\nadjusts the intra-platoon gap of an individual platoon member to maximize\ntraffic flow in response to dynamically changing, complex traffic conditions\nfor highway on-ramp merging. The state space of the framework is carefully\ndesigned in consultation with the transportation literature to incorporate\ncritical traffic parameters relevant to merging efficiency. A deep\ndeterministic policy gradient algorithm is adopted to account for the\ncontinuous action space to ensure precise and continuous adjustment of the\nintra-platoon gap.

    "abstract": "Accurate polyp segmentation is of great importance for colorectal cancer\ndiagnosis and treatment. However, due to the high cost of producing accurate\nmask annotations, existing polyp segmentation methods suffer from severe data\nshortage and impaired model generalization. Reversely, coarse polyp bounding\nbox annotations are more accessible. Thus, in this paper, we propose a boosted\nBoxPolyp model to make full use of both accurate mask and extra coarse box\nannotations. In practice, box annotations are applied to alleviate the\nover-fitting issue of previous polyp segmentation models, which generate\nfine-grained polyp area through the iterative boosted segmentation model. To\nachieve this goal, a fusion filter sampling (FFS) module is firstly proposed to\ngenerate pixel-wise pseudo labels from box annotations with less noise, leading\nto significant performance improvements. Besides, considering the appearance\nconsistency of the same polyp, an image consistency (IC) loss is designed. Such\nIC loss explicitly narrows the distance between features extracted by two\ndifferent networks, which improves the robustness of the model. Note that our\nBoxPolyp is a plug-and-play model, which can be merged into any appealing\nbackbone. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on five challenging\nbenchmarks confirm that our proposed model outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "Image instance segmentation is a fundamental research topic in autonomous\ndriving, which is crucial for scene understanding and road safety. Advanced\nlearning-based approaches often rely on the costly 2D mask annotations for\ntraining. In this paper, we present a more artful framework, LiDAR-guided\nWeakly Supervised Instance Segmentation (LWSIS), which leverages the\noff-the-shelf 3D data, i.e., Point Cloud, together with the 3D boxes, as\nnatural weak supervisions for training the 2D image instance segmentation\nmodels. Our LWSIS not only exploits the complementary information in multimodal\ndata during training, but also significantly reduces the annotation cost of the\ndense 2D masks. In detail, LWSIS consists of two crucial modules, Point Label\nAssignment (PLA) and Graph-based Consistency Regularization (GCR). The former\nmodule aims to automatically assign the 3D point cloud as 2D point-wise labels,\nwhile the latter further refines the predictions by enforcing geometry and\nappearance consistency of the multimodal data. Moreover, we conduct a secondary\ninstance segmentation annotation on the nuScenes, named nuInsSeg, to encourage\nfurther research on multimodal perception tasks. Extensive experiments on the\nnuInsSeg, as well as the large-scale Waymo, show that LWSIS can substantially\nimprove existing weakly supervised segmentation models by only involving 3D\ndata during training. Additionally, LWSIS can also be incorporated into 3D\nobject detectors like PointPainting to boost the 3D detection performance for\nfree.

Although a number 2 of automated methods have been introduced,\nthese tend to rely on simplifying assumptions and 3 heuristics to improve\ncomputational tractability. We demonstrate a fully automated layout design 4\npipeline that attempts to solve a more general formulation with greater\ngeometric flexibility that 5 accounts for shading losses. Our approach\ngenerates rooftop areas from satellite imagery and uses 6 MINLP optimization to\nselect panel positions, azimuth angles and tilt angles on an individual basis 7\nrather than imposing any predefined layouts. Our results demonstrate that\nalthough several common 8 heuristics are often effective, they may not be\nuniversally suitable due to complications resulting 9 from geometric\nrestrictions and shading losses. Finally, we evaluate a few specific heuristics\nfrom the 10 literature and propose a potential new rule of thumb that may help\nimprove rooftop solar energy 11 potential when shading effects are considered.",

    "abstract": "The weakly supervised instance segmentation is a challenging task. The\nexisting methods typically use bounding boxes as supervision and optimize the\nnetwork with a regularization loss term such as pairwise color affinity loss\nfor instance segmentation. Through systematic analysis, we found that the\ncommonly used pairwise affinity loss has two limitations: (1) it works with\ncolor affinity but leads to inferior performance with other modalities such as\ndepth gradient, (2)the original affinity loss does not prevent trivial\npredictions as intended but actually accelerates this process due to the\naffinity loss term being symmetric. To overcome these two limitations, in this\npaper, we propose a novel asymmetric affinity loss which provides the penalty\nagainst the trivial prediction and generalizes well with affinity loss from\ndifferent modalities. With the proposed asymmetric affinity loss, our method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the Cityscapes dataset and\noutperforms our baseline method by 3.5% in mask AP.",

We consider a base station\n(BS) coordinating nearby ICVs to train a neural network in a collaborative yet\ndistributed manner, in order to limit data traffic and privacy leakage.\nHowever, due to the mobility of vehicles, the connections between the BS and\nICVs are short-lived, which affects the resource utilization of ICVs, and thus,\nthe convergence speed of the training process. In this paper, we propose an\naccelerated FL-ICV framework, by optimizing the duration of each training round\nand the number of local iterations, for better convergence performance of FL.\nWe propose a mobility-aware optimization algorithm called MOB-FL, which aims at\nmaximizing the resource utilization of ICVs under short-lived wireless\nconnections, so as to increase the convergence speed.

    "abstract": "Air-gapped systems are isolated from the Internet due to the sensitive\ninformation they handle. This paper presents COVID-bit, a new COVert channel\nattack that leaks sensitive information over the air from highly isolated\nsystems. The information emanates from the air-gapped computer over the air to\na distance of 2m and more and can be picked up by a nearby insider or spy with\na mobile phone or laptop. Malware on an air-gapped computer can generate radio\nwaves by executing crafted code on the target system. The malicious code\nexploits the dynamic power consumption of modern computers and manipulates the\nmomentary loads on CPU cores. This technique allows the malware to control the\ncomputer's internal utilization and generate low-frequency electromagnetic\nradiation in the 0 - 60 kHz band. Sensitive information (e.g., files,\nencryption keys, biometric data, and keylogging) can be modulated over the\nemanated signals and received by a nearby mobile phone at a max speed of 1000\nbits/sec. We show that a smartphone or laptop with a small \\$1 antenna carried\nby a malicious insider or visitor can be used as a covert receiver. Notably,\nthe attack is highly evasive since it executes from an ordinary user-level\nprocess, does not require root privileges, and is effective even within a\nVirtual Machine (VM). We discuss the attack model and provide technical\ndetails. We implement air-gap transmission of texts and files, and present\nsignal generation and data modulation.

    "abstract": "Terabytes of data are collected every day by wind turbine manufacturers from\ntheir fleets. The data contain valuable real-time information for turbine\nhealth diagnostics and performance monitoring, for predicting rare failures and\nthe remaining service life of critical parts. And yet, this wealth of data from\nwind turbine fleets remains inaccessible to operators, utility companies, and\nresearchers as manufacturing companies prefer the privacy of their fleets'\nturbine data for business strategic reasons. The lack of data access impedes\nthe exploitation of opportunities, such as improving data-driven turbine\noperation and maintenance strategies and reducing downtimes. We present a\ndistributed federated machine learning approach that leaves the data on the\nwind turbines to preserve the data privacy, as desired by manufacturers, while\nstill enabling fleet-wide learning on those local data. We demonstrate in a\ncase study that wind turbines which are scarce in representative training data\nbenefit from more accurate fault detection models with federated learning,\nwhile no turbine experiences a loss in model performance by participating in\nthe federated learning process. When comparing conventional and federated\ntraining processes, the average model training time rises significantly by a\nfactor of 7 in the federated training due to increased communication and\noverhead operations. Thus, model training times might constitute an impediment\nthat needs to be further explored and alleviated in federated learning\napplications, especially for large wind turbine fleets.",

A way to overcome this is to use intrinsic motivation in\norder to explore new transitions until a reward is found.

    "abstract": "Network pruning is a promising way to generate light but accurate models and\nenable their deployment on resource-limited edge devices. However, the current\nstate-of-the-art assumes that the effective sub-network and the other\nsuperfluous parameters in the given network share the same distribution, where\npruning inevitably involves a distribution truncation operation. They usually\neliminate values near zero. While simple, it may not be the most appropriate\nmethod, as effective models may naturally have many small values associated\nwith them. Removing near-zero values already embedded in model space may\nsignificantly reduce model accuracy. Another line of work has proposed to\nassign discrete prior over all possible sub-structures that still rely on\nhuman-crafted prior hypotheses. Worse still, existing methods use regularized\npoint estimates, namely Hard Pruning, that can not provide error estimations\nand fail reliability justification for the pruned networks. In this paper, we\npropose a novel distribution-lossless pruning method, named DLLP, to\ntheoretically find the pruned lottery within Bayesian treatment. Specifically,\nDLLP remodels the vanilla networks as discrete priors for the latent pruned\nmodel and the other redundancy. More importantly, DLLP uses Stein Variational\nInference to approach the latent prior and effectively bypasses calculating KL\ndivergence with unknown distribution. Extensive experiments based on small\nCifar-10 and large-scaled ImageNet demonstrate that our method can obtain\nsparser networks with great generalization performance while providing\nquantified reliability for the pruned model.",

Through this formulation, the proposed EASpace\ncould learn when to execute which expert policy and how long it lasts. An\nintra-macro-action learning rule is proposed by adjusting the temporal\ndifference target of macro actions to improve the data efficiency and alleviate\nthe non-stationarity issue in multi-agent settings. Furthermore, an additional\nreward proportional to the execution time of macro actions is introduced to\nencourage the environment exploration via macro actions, which is significant\nto learn a long-horizon task. Theoretical analysis is presented to show the\nconvergence of the proposed algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm\nis illustrated by a grid-based game and a multi-agent pursuit problem.

However, a tremendous surge in cloud\nresource demand stave off service availability resulting into outages,\nperformance degradation, load imbalance, and excessive power-consumption. The\nexisting approaches mainly attempt to address the problem by using multi-cloud\nand running multiple replicas of a virtual machine (VM) which accounts for high\noperational-cost. This paper proposes a Fault Tolerant Elastic Resource\nManagement (FT-ERM) framework that addresses aforementioned problem from a\ndifferent perspective by inducing high-availability in servers and VMs.\nSpecifically, (1) an online failure predictor is developed to anticipate\nfailure-prone VMs based on predicted resource contention; (2) the operational\nstatus of server is monitored with the help of power analyser, resource\nestimator and thermal analyser to identify any failure due to overloading and\noverheating of servers proactively; and (3) failure-prone VMs are assigned to\nproposed fault-tolerance unit composed of decision matrix and safe box to\ntrigger VM migration and handle any outage beforehand while maintaining desired\nlevel of availability for cloud users. The proposed framework is evaluated and\ncompared against state-of-the-arts by executing experiments using two\nreal-world datasets. FT-ERM improved the availability of the services up to\n34.47% and scales down VM-migration and power-consumption up to 88.6% and\n62.4%, respectively over without FT-ERM approach.",

Moreover, SHACL is\npeculiar in allowing only a restricted form of expressions (so-called targets)\non the left-hand side of inclusion constraints.\nThe goal of this paper is to obtain a clear picture of the impact and\nexpressiveness of these features and restrictions. We show that each of the\nfour features is primitive: using the feature, one can express boolean queries\nthat are not expressible without using the feature. We also show that the\nrestriction that SHACL imposes on allowed targets is inessential, as long as\nclosure constraints are not used.\nIn addition, we show that enriching SHACL with \"full\" versions of equality\ntests, or disjointness tests, results in a strictly more powerful language.",

    "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning is an important method for deep graph clustering.\nThe existing methods first generate the graph views with stochastic\naugmentations and then train the network with a cross-view consistency\nprinciple. Although good performance has been achieved, we observe that the\nexisting augmentation methods are usually random and rely on pre-defined\naugmentations, which is insufficient and lacks negotiation between the final\nclustering task. To solve the problem, we propose a novel Graph Contrastive\nClustering method with the Learnable graph Data Augmentation (GCC-LDA), which\nis optimized completely by the neural networks. An adversarial learning\nmechanism is designed to keep cross-view consistency in the latent space while\nensuring the diversity of augmented views. In our framework, a structure\naugmentor and an attribute augmentor are constructed for augmentation learning\nin both structure level and attribute level. To improve the reliability of the\nlearned affinity matrix, clustering is introduced to the learning procedure and\nthe learned affinity matrix is refined with both the high-confidence\npseudo-label matrix and the cross-view sample similarity matrix. During the\ntraining procedure, to provide persistent optimization for the learned view, we\ndesign a two-stage training strategy to obtain more reliable clustering\ninformation.

    "abstract": "Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)-based models have become popular\nfoundation models to solve many time-series problems. Combining neural ODEs\nwith traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular\ntime series. However, ODE-based models require the trajectory of hidden states\nto be defined based on the initial observed value or the last available\nobservation. This fact raises questions about how long the generated hidden\nstate is sufficient and whether it is effective when long sequences are used\ninstead of the typically used shorter sequences. In this article, we introduce\nCrossPyramid, a novel ODE-based model that aims to enhance the generalizability\nof sequences representation. CrossPyramid does not rely only on the hidden\nstate from the last observed value; it also considers ODE latent\nrepresentations learned from other samples. The main idea of our proposed model\nis to define the hidden state for the unobserved values based on the non-linear\ncorrelation between samples. Accordingly, CrossPyramid is built with three\ndistinctive parts: (1) ODE Auto-Encoder to learn the best data representation.\n(2) Pyramidal attention method to categorize the learned representations\n(hidden state) based on the relationship characteristics between samples. (3)\nCross-level ODE-RNN to integrate the previously learned information and provide\nthe final latent state for each sample. Through extensive experiments on\npartially-observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that the proposed\narchitecture can effectively model the long gaps in intermittent series and\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Offline to Online reinforcement learning requires a lot of offline\ndata to initialize the policy, and distribution shift can easily lead to\nperformance degradation during online fine-tuning.

Furthermore, we prevent\nperformance degradation due to large estimation errors in the Q-function by the\nensemble Q-functions.

While\ngraph neural network (GNN)-based models are effective at learning to simulate\ncomplex physical dynamics, such as fluids, cloth and articulated bodies, they\nhave been less effective and efficient on rigid-body physics, except with very\nsimple shapes. Existing methods that model collisions through the meshes' nodes\nare often inaccurate because they struggle when collisions occur on faces far\nfrom nodes. Alternative approaches that represent the geometry densely with\nmany particles are prohibitively expensive for complex shapes.

Compared to learned node- and particle-based methods, FIGNet is around\n4x more accurate in simulating complex shape interactions, while also 8x more\ncomputationally efficient on sparse, rigid meshes. Moreover, FIGNet can learn\nfrictional dynamics directly from real-world data, and can be more accurate\nthan analytical solvers given modest amounts of training data.

To this end, tessellation of the\nparticle positions is applied to associate a volume to each particle.\nConsidering then two subsequent time instants, the dynamics of the volume can\nbe assessed. Determining the volume change of tessellation cells yields the\ndivergence of the particle velocity and the rotation of the cells evaluates its\ncurl. Thus the helicity of particle velocity can be likewise computed and\nswirling motion of particle clouds can be quantified. We propose a modified\nversion of Voronoi tessellation and which overcomes some drawbacks of the\nclassical Voronoi tessellation.

    "abstract": "Recently, CLIP has been applied to pixel-level zero-shot learning tasks via a\ntwo-stage scheme. The general idea is to first generate class-agnostic region\nproposals and then feed the cropped proposal regions to CLIP to utilize its\nimage-level zero-shot classification capability. While effective, such a scheme\nrequires two image encoders, one for proposal generation and one for CLIP,\nleading to a complicated pipeline and high computational cost. In this work, we\npursue a simpler-and-efficient one-stage solution that directly extends CLIP's\nzero-shot prediction capability from image to pixel level. Our investigation\nstarts with a straightforward extension as our baseline that generates semantic\nmasks by comparing the similarity between text and patch embeddings extracted\nfrom CLIP. However, such a paradigm could heavily overfit the seen classes and\nfail to generalize to unseen classes. To handle this issue, we propose three\nsimple-but-effective designs and figure out that they can significantly retain\nthe inherent zero-shot capacity of CLIP and improve pixel-level generalization\nability. Incorporating those modifications leads to an efficient zero-shot\nsemantic segmentation system called ZegCLIP.

    "abstract": "The extreme requirements for high reliability and low latency in\nBeyond-Fifth-Generation (B5G) and Sixth Generation (6G) mobile systems are\nchallenging the design of multihop relay networks. In this paper we investigate\nthe problem of multi-hop decode-and-forward (DF) relaying in the finite\nblocklength (FBL) regime, and propose a dynamic multi-hop hybrid automated\nrepeat request (DMH-HARQ) scheme, which maximizes the end-to-end (E2E)\ncommunication reliability in such systems. We also propose an integer dynamic\nprogramming (DP) algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal DMH-HARQ schedule.\nConstrained within a certain time frame to accomplish multi-hop relaying, our\nproposed approach is proven to outperform any static HARQ strategy regarding\nthe E2E reliability.",

    "abstract": "Online Feedback Optimization is a method used to steer the operation of a\nprocess plant to its optimal operating point without explicitly solving a\nnonlinear constrained optimization problem. This is achieved by leveraging a\nlinear plant model and feedback from measurements. However the presence of\nplant-model mismatch leads to suboptimal results when using this approach.\nLearning the plant-model mismatch enables Online Feedback Optimization to\novercome this shortcoming. In this work we present a novel application of\nOnline Feedback Optimization with online model adaptation using Gaussian\nProcess regression. We demonstrate our approach with a realistic load sharing\nproblem in a compressor station with parametric and structural plant-model\nmismatch. We assume imperfect knowledge of the compressor maps and design an\nOnline Feedback Optimization controller that minimizes the compressor station\npower consumption. In the evaluated scenario, imperfect knowledge of the plant\nleads to a 5\\% increase in power consumption compared to the case with perfect\nknowledge. We demonstrate that Online Feedback Optimization with model\nadaptation reduces this increase to only 0.8%, closely approximating the case\nof perfect knowledge of the plant, regardless of the type of mismatch.",

    "abstract": "Recently, domain-specific PLMs have been proposed to boost the task\nperformance of specific domains (e.g., biomedical and computer science) by\ncontinuing to pre-train general PLMs with domain-specific corpora. However,\nthis Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training (DAPT; Gururangan et al. (2020)) tends to\nforget the previous general knowledge acquired by general PLMs, which leads to\na catastrophic forgetting phenomenon and sub-optimal performance. To alleviate\nthis problem, we propose a new framework of General Memory Augmented\nPre-trained Language Model (G-MAP), which augments the domain-specific PLM by a\nmemory representation built from the frozen general PLM without losing any\ngeneral knowledge. Specifically, we propose a new memory-augmented layer, and\nbased on it, different augmented strategies are explored to build the memory\nrepresentation and then adaptively fuse it into the domain-specific PLM. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of G-MAP on various domains (biomedical and\ncomputer science publications, news, and reviews) and different kinds (text\nclassification, QA, NER) of tasks, and the extensive results show that the\nproposed G-MAP can achieve SOTA results on all tasks.",

    "abstract": "Explicit time integration schemes coupled with Galerkin discretizations of\ntime-dependent partial differential equations require solving a linear system\nwith the mass matrix at each time step. For applications in structural\ndynamics, the solution of the linear system is frequently approximated through\nso-called mass lumping, which consists in replacing the mass matrix by some\ndiagonal approximation. Mass lumping has been widely used in engineering\npractice for decades already and has a sound mathematical theory supporting it\nfor finite element methods using the classical Lagrange basis. However, the\ntheory for more general basis functions is still missing. Our paper partly\naddresses this shortcoming. Some special and practically relevant properties of\nlumped mass matrices are proved and we discuss how these properties naturally\nextend to banded and Kronecker product matrices whose structure allows to solve\nlinear systems very efficiently.

    "abstract": "The transparency and privacy behavior of mobile browsers has remained widely\nunexplored by the research community. In fact, as opposed to regular Android\napps, mobile browsers may present contradicting privacy behaviors. On the one\nend, they can have access to (and can expose) a unique combination of sensitive\nuser data, from users' browsing history to permission-protected personally\nidentifiable information (PII) such as unique identifiers and geolocation.\nHowever, on the other end, they also are in a unique position to protect users'\nprivacy by limiting data sharing with other parties by implementing ad-blocking\nfeatures. In this paper, we perform a comparative and empirical analysis on how\nhundreds of Android web browsers protect or expose user data during browsing\nsessions. To this end, we collect the largest dataset of Android browsers to\ndate, from the Google Play Store and four Chinese app stores. Then, we\ndeveloped a novel analysis pipeline that combines static and dynamic analysis\nmethods to find a wide range of privacy-enhancing (e.g., ad-blocking) and\nprivacy-harming behaviors (e.g., sending browsing histories to third parties,\nnot validating TLS certificates, and exposing PII -- including non-resettable\nidentifiers -- to third parties) across browsers. We find that various popular\napps on both Google Play and Chinese stores have these privacy-harming\nbehaviors, including apps that claim to be privacy-enhancing in their\ndescriptions. Overall, our study not only provides new insights into important\nyet overlooked considerations for browsers' adoption and transparency, but also\nthat automatic app analysis systems (e.g., sandboxes) need context-specific\nanalysis to reveal such privacy behaviors.",

    "title": "An Intuitive and Unconstrained 2D Cube Representation for Simultaneous  Head Detection and Pose Estimation",
    "abstract": "Most recent head pose estimation (HPE) methods are dominated by the Euler\nangle representation. To avoid its inherent ambiguity problem of rotation\nlabels, alternative quaternion-based and vector-based representations are\nintroduced. However, they both are not visually intuitive, and often derived\nfrom equivocal Euler angle labels. In this paper, we present a novel\nsingle-stage keypoint-based method via an {\\it intuitive} and {\\it\nunconstrained} 2D cube representation for joint head detection and pose\nestimation. The 2D cube is an orthogonal projection of the 3D regular\nhexahedron label roughly surrounding one head, and itself contains the head\nlocation. It can reflect the head orientation straightforwardly and\nunambiguously in any rotation angle. Unlike the general 6-DoF object pose\nestimation, our 2D cube ignores the 3-DoF of head size but retains the 3-DoF of\nhead pose. Based on the prior of equal side length, we can effortlessly obtain\nthe closed-form solution of Euler angles from predicted 2D head cube instead of\napplying the error-prone PnP algorithm. In experiments, our proposed method\nachieves comparable results with other representative methods on the public\nAFLW2000 and BIWI datasets. Besides, a novel test on the CMU panoptic dataset\nshows that our method can be seamlessly adapted to the unconstrained full-view\nHPE task without modification.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the performance of novel view synthesis using perspective\nimages has dramatically improved with the advent of neural radiance fields\n(NeRF). This study proposes two novel techniques that effectively build NeRF\nfor 360{\\textdegree} omnidirectional images. Due to the characteristics of a\n360{\\textdegree} image of ERP format that has spatial distortion in their high\nlatitude regions and a 360{\\textdegree} wide viewing angle, NeRF's general ray\nsampling strategy is ineffective. Hence, the view synthesis accuracy of NeRF is\nlimited and learning is not efficient. We propose two non-uniform ray sampling\nschemes for NeRF to suit 360{\\textdegree} images - distortion-aware ray\nsampling and content-aware ray sampling. We created an evaluation dataset\nSynth360 using Replica and SceneCity models of indoor and outdoor scenes,\nrespectively. In experiments, we show that our proposal successfully builds\n360{\\textdegree} image NeRF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The\nproposal is widely applicable to advanced variants of NeRF. DietNeRF, AugNeRF,\nand NeRF++ combined with the proposed techniques further improve the\nperformance. Moreover, we show that our proposed method enhances the quality of\nreal-world scenes in 360{\\textdegree} images.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection in time-series has been extensively\ninvestigated in the literature. Notwithstanding the relevance of this topic in\nnumerous application fields, a complete and extensive evaluation of recent\nstate-of-the-art techniques is still missing. Few efforts have been made to\ncompare existing unsupervised time-series anomaly detection methods rigorously.\nHowever, only standard performance metrics, namely precision, recall, and\nF1-score are usually considered. Essential aspects for assessing their\npractical relevance are therefore neglected. This paper proposes an original\nand in-depth evaluation study of recent unsupervised anomaly detection\ntechniques in time-series. Instead of relying solely on standard performance\nmetrics, additional yet informative metrics and protocols are taken into\naccount. In particular, (1) more elaborate performance metrics specifically\ntailored for time-series are used; (2) the model size and the model stability\nare studied; (3) an analysis of the tested approaches with respect to the\nanomaly type is provided; and (4) a clear and unique protocol is followed for\nall experiments. Overall, this extensive analysis aims to assess the maturity\nof state-of-the-art time-series anomaly detection, give insights regarding\ntheir applicability under real-world setups and provide to the community a more\ncomplete evaluation protocol.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the TransBoat, a novel omnidirectional unmanned surface\nvehicle (USV) with a magnetbased docking system for overwater construction with\nwave disturbances. This is the first such USV that can build overwater\nstructures by transporting modules. The TransBoat incorporates two features\ndesigned to reject wave disturbances. First, the TransBoat's expandable body\nstructure can actively transform from a mono-hull into a multi-hull for\nstabilization in turbulent environments by extending its four outrigger hulls.\nSecond, a real-time nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme is\nproposed for all shapes of the TransBoat to enhance its maneuverability and\nresist disturbance to its movement, based on a nonlinear dynamic model. An\nexperimental approach is proposed to identify the parameters of the dynamic\nmodel, and a subsequent trajectory tracking test validates the dynamics, NMPC\ncontroller and system mobility. Further, docking experiments identify improved\nperformance in the expanded form of the TransBoat compared with the contracted\nform, including an increased success rate (of ~ 10%) and reduced docking time\n(of ~ 40 s on average).

    "abstract": "Large-scale multi-modal training with image-text pairs imparts strong\ngeneralization to CLIP model. Since training on a similar scale for videos is\ninfeasible, recent approaches focus on the effective transfer of image-based\nCLIP to the video domain. In this pursuit, new parametric modules are added to\nlearn temporal information and inter-frame relationships which require\nmeticulous design efforts. Furthermore, when the resulting models are learned\non videos, they tend to overfit on the given task distribution and lack in\ngeneralization aspect. This begs the following question: How to effectively\ntransfer image-level CLIP representations to videos? In this work, we show that\na simple Video Fine-tuned CLIP (ViFi-CLIP) baseline is generally sufficient to\nbridge the domain gap from images to videos. Our qualitative analysis\nillustrates that the frame-level processing from CLIP image-encoder followed by\nfeature pooling and similarity matching with corresponding text embeddings\nhelps in implicitly modeling the temporal cues within ViFi-CLIP. Such\nfine-tuning helps the model to focus on scene dynamics, moving objects and\ninter-object relationships. For low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is not\nviable, we propose a `bridge and prompt' approach that first uses fine-tuning\nto bridge the domain gap and then learns prompts on language and vision side to\nadapt CLIP representations. We extensively evaluate this simple yet strong\nbaseline on zero-shot, base-to-novel generalization, few-shot and fully\nsupervised settings across five video benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance on homophilic\ngraph data while being far less impressive when handling non-homophilic graph\ndata due to the inherent low-pass filtering property of GNNs. In general, since\nthe real-world graphs are often a complex mixture of diverse subgraph patterns,\nlearning a universal spectral filter on the graph from the global perspective\nas in most current works may still suffer from great difficulty in adapting to\nthe variation of local patterns. On the basis of the theoretical analysis on\nlocal patterns, we rethink the existing spectral filtering methods and propose\nthe \\textbf{\\underline{N}}ode-oriented spectral \\textbf{\\underline{F}}iltering\nfor \\textbf{\\underline{G}}raph \\textbf{\\underline{N}}eural\n\\textbf{\\underline{N}}etwork (namely NFGNN). By estimating the node-oriented\nspectral filter for each node, NFGNN is provided with the capability of precise\nlocal node positioning via the generalized translated operator, thus\ndiscriminating the variations of local homophily patterns adaptively.\nMeanwhile, the utilization of re-parameterization brings a good trade-off\nbetween global consistency and local sensibility for learning the node-oriented\nspectral filters. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the localization\nproperty of NFGNN, demonstrating that the signal after adaptive filtering is\nstill positioned around the corresponding node. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed NFGNN achieves more favorable performance.",

At the second stage of\nfine-tuning, we take both original speech sequences and original text sequences\nin parallel into the model to fine-tune the network, and use Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence to regularize their outputs. Experiments on MuST-C speech\ntranslation benchmark and analysis show that M^3ST outperforms current strong\nbaselines and achieves state-of-the-art results on eight directions with an\naverage BLEU of 29.9.",

    "abstract": "Any organization needs to improve their products, services, and processes. In\nthis context, engaging with customers and understanding their journey is\nessential. Organizations have leveraged various techniques and technologies to\nsupport customer engagement, from call centres to chatbots and virtual agents.\nRecently, these systems have used Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) to analyze large volumes of customer feedback and engagement\ndata. The goal is to understand customers in context and provide meaningful\nanswers across various channels. Despite multiple advances in Conversational\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Recommender Systems (RS), it is still\nchallenging to understand the intent behind customer questions during the\ncustomer journey. To address this challenge, in this paper, we study and\nanalyze the recent work in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) in general\nand, more specifically, in chatbot-based CRS. We introduce a pipeline to\ncontextualize the input utterances in conversations. We then take the next step\ntowards leveraging reverse feature engineering to link the contextualized input\nand learning model to support intent recognition. Since performance evaluation\nis achieved based on different ML models, we use transformer base models to\nevaluate the proposed approach using a labelled dialogue dataset (MSDialogue)\nof question-answering interactions between information seekers and answer\nproviders.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a planning problem for a hierarchical finite state\nmachine (HFSM) and develop an algorithm for efficiently computing optimal plans\nbetween any two states. The algorithm consists of an offline and an online\nstep. In the offline step, one computes exit costs for each machine in the\nHFSM. It needs to be done only once for a given HFSM, and it is shown to have\ntime complexity scaling linearly with the number of machines in the HFSM. In\nthe online step, one computes an optimal plan from an initial state to a goal\nstate, by first reducing the HFSM (using the exit costs), computing an optimal\ntrajectory for the reduced HFSM, and then expand this trajectory to an optimal\nplan for the original HFSM. The time complexity is near-linearly with the depth\nof the HFSM. It is argued that HFSMs arise naturally for large-scale control\nsystems, exemplified by an application where a robot moves between houses to\ncomplete tasks. We compare our algorithm with Dijkstra's algorithm on HFSMs\nconsisting of up to 2 million states, where our algorithm outperforms the\nlatter, being several orders of magnitude faster.",

    "abstract": "Learning low-dimensional representation for large number of products present\nin an e-commerce catalogue plays a vital role as they are helpful in tasks like\nproduct ranking, product recommendation, finding similar products, modelling\nuser-behaviour etc. Recently, a lot of tasks in the NLP field are getting\ntackled using the Transformer based models and these deep models are widely\napplicable in the industries setting to solve various problems. With this\nmotivation, we apply transformer based model for learning contextual\nrepresentation of products in an e-commerce setting. In this work, we propose a\nnovel approach of pre-training transformer based model on a users generated\nsessions dataset obtained from a large fashion e-commerce platform to obtain\nlatent product representation. Once pre-trained, we show that the low-dimension\nrepresentation of the products can be obtained given the product attributes\ninformation as a textual sentence. We mainly pre-train BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT\nand XLNET variants of transformer model and show a quantitative analysis of the\nproducts representation obtained from these models with respect to Next Product\nRecommendation(NPR) and Content Ranking(CR) tasks. For both the tasks, we\ncollect an evaluation data from the fashion e-commerce platform and observe\nthat XLNET model outperform other variants with a MRR of 0.5 for NPR and NDCG\nof 0.634 for CR. XLNET model also outperforms the Word2Vec based\nnon-transformer baseline on both the downstream tasks. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first and novel work for pre-training transformer based\nmodels using users generated sessions data containing products that are\nrepresented with rich attributes information for adoption in e-commerce\nsetting. These models can be further fine-tuned in order to solve various\ndownstream tasks in e-commerce, thereby eliminating the need to train a model\nfrom scratch.",

However, there are many options to design the feature vector\nrepresentation and there is no obvious preference. To get a better\nunderstanding of the different representations, we analyze their similarities\nand differences.

    "abstract": "Approximately 4.2 million youth and young adults experience homelessness each\nyear in the United States and lack of basic necessities puts this population at\nhigh-risk of being trafficked or exploited. Although all runaway and homeless\nyouth (RHY) are at risk of being victims of human trafficking, certain racial,\nethnic, and gender groups are disproportionately affected. Motivated by these\nfacts, our goal is to improve equitable access to housing resources for at-risk\nRHY in New York City (NYC) by expanding the current housing capacity, while\nutilizing priority thresholds that guide decisions regarding which youth should\nstart receiving service based on the number of beds idle in the system. Our\napproach involves an $M/M/N/\\{K_j\\}+M$ queuing model with many statistically\nidentical servers (beds) and RHY from different demographic groups with limited\npatience arriving to the a large crisis and emergency shelter in NYC. The\nqueuing model allows us to: (i) investigate the populations and demographics\nthat are facing access barriers, (ii) project the minimum number of beds\nrequired to provide a certain global service quality level to all youth,\nregardless of demographic characteristics, and (iii) use priority thresholds\nwhile matching RHY with beds to promote equity. The recommendations regarding\nthe capacity expansion and priority thresholds improves equitable access to\nthis crisis and emergency shelter by decreasing the average number of RHY\nabandoning the system by 92%, with a particular reduction in the abandonment of\nRHY who are at high-risk of experiencing trafficking.",

The experimental\nanalysis confirms that RADAR is able to $(i)$ match samples to multiple\ndifferent TTPs, and $(ii)$ effectively detect malware with an AUC score of\n0.868.

    "abstract": "Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to transfer knowledge learned from\na source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the source data is\nunavailable during adaptation. Existing approaches for SFDA focus on\nself-training usually including well-established entropy minimization\ntechniques. One of the main challenges in SFDA is to reduce accumulation of\nerrors caused by domain misalignment. A recent strategy successfully managed to\nreduce error accumulation by pseudo-labeling the target samples based on\nclass-wise prototypes (centroids) generated by their clustering in the\nrepresentation space. However, this strategy also creates cases for which the\ncross-entropy of a pseudo-label and the minimum entropy have a conflict in\ntheir objectives. We call this conflict the centroid-hypothesis conflict. We\npropose to reconcile this conflict by aligning the entropy minimization\nobjective with that of the pseudo labels' cross entropy. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of aligning the two loss objectives on three domain adaptation\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "Changes in real-world dynamic processes are often described in terms of\ndifferences in energies $\\textbf{E}(\\underline{\\alpha})$ of a set of\nspectral-bands $\\underline{\\alpha}$. Given continuous spectra of two classes\n$A$ and $B$, or in general, two stochastic processes $S^{(A)}(f)$ and\n$S^{(B)}(f)$, $f \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$, we address the ubiquitous problem of\nidentifying a subset of intervals of $f$ called spectral-bands\n$\\underline{\\alpha} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^+$ such that the energies\n$\\textbf{E}(\\underline{\\alpha})$ of these bands can optimally discriminate\nbetween the two classes. We introduce EGO-MDA, an unsupervised method to\nidentify optimal spectral-bands $\\underline{\\alpha}^*$ for given samples of\nspectra from two classes. EGO-MDA employs a statistical approach that\niteratively minimizes an adjusted multinomial log-likelihood (deviance)\ncriterion $\\mathcal{D}(\\underline{\\alpha},\\mathcal{M})$.

For pathological cases of low separation between mixtures and\nmodel misspecification, we discuss the effect of the sample size and the number\nof iterations on the estimates of parameters $\\mathcal{M}$ and therefore the\nclassifier performance. A case study on a synthetic data set is provided. In an\nengineering application of optimal spectral-banding for anomaly tracking,\nEGO-MDA achieved at least 70% improvement in the median deviance relative to\nother methods tested.",

    "abstract": "Motion prediction systems aim to capture the future behavior of traffic\nscenarios enabling autonomous vehicles to perform safe and efficient planning.\nThe evolution of these scenarios is highly uncertain and depends on the\ninteractions of agents with static and dynamic objects in the scene.

However, one of the main challenges that remains\nunexplored is how to address the complexity and opacity of these models in\norder to deal with the transparency requirements for autonomous driving\nsystems, which includes aspects such as interpretability and explainability. In\nthis work, we aim to improve the explainability of motion prediction systems by\nusing different approaches. First, we propose a new Explainable Heterogeneous\nGraph-based Policy (XHGP) model based on an heterograph representation of the\ntraffic scene and lane-graph traversals, which learns interaction behaviors\nusing object-level and type-level attention. This learned attention provides\ninformation about the most important agents and interactions in the scene.\nSecond, we explore this same idea with the explanations provided by\nGNNExplainer. Third, we apply counterfactual reasoning to provide explanations\nof selected individual scenarios by exploring the sensitivity of the trained\nmodel to changes made to the input data, i.e., masking some elements of the\nscene, modifying trajectories, and adding or removing dynamic agents.

A front-end LID module helps to improve the performance of many\nspeech-based applications in the multilingual scenario. India is a populous\ncountry with diverse cultures and languages. The majority of the Indian\npopulation needs to use their respective native languages for verbal\ninteraction with machines. Therefore, the development of efficient Indian\nspoken language recognition systems is useful for adapting smart technologies\nin every section of Indian society. The field of Indian LID has started gaining\nmomentum in the last two decades, mainly due to the development of several\nstandard multilingual speech corpora for the Indian languages. Even though\nsignificant research progress has already been made in this field, to the best\nof our knowledge, there are not many attempts to analytically review them\ncollectively. In this work, we have conducted one of the very first attempts to\npresent a comprehensive review of the Indian spoken language recognition\nresearch field.

Several essential aspects of the Indian LID research, such\nas the detailed description of the available speech corpora, the major research\ncontributions, including the earlier attempts based on statistical modeling to\nthe recent approaches based on different neural network architectures, and the\nfuture research trends are discussed.

    "abstract": "Traditional supervised learning mostly works on individual tasks and requires\ntraining on a large set of task-specific examples. This paradigm seriously\nhinders the development of task generalization since preparing a task-specific\nexample set is costly. To build a system that can quickly and easily generalize\nto new tasks, task instructions have been adopted as an emerging trend of\nsupervision recently. These instructions give the model the definition of the\ntask and allow the model to output the appropriate answer based on the\ninstructions and inputs. However, task instructions are often expressed in\ndifferent forms, which can be interpreted from two threads: first, some\ninstructions are short sentences and are pretrained language model (PLM)\noriented, such as prompts, while other instructions are paragraphs and are\nhuman-oriented, such as those in Amazon MTurk; second, different end-users very\nlikely explain the same task with instructions of different textual\nexpressions. A robust system for task generalization should be able to handle\nany new tasks regardless of the variability of instructions.\nHowever, the system robustness in dealing with instruction-driven task\ngeneralization is still unexplored. This work investigates the system\nrobustness when the instructions of new tasks are (i) maliciously manipulated,\n(ii) paraphrased, or (iii) from different levels of conciseness.

This design confounds the learning of multi-modal\nfeature encoding with robust sound decoding for audio separation. To generalize\nto a new instrument: one must finetune the entire visual and audio network for\nall musical instruments. We re-formulate visual-sound separation task and\npropose Instrument as Query (iQuery) with a flexible query expansion mechanism.\nOur approach ensures cross-modal consistency and cross-instrument\ndisentanglement. We utilize \"visually named\" queries to initiate the learning\nof audio queries and use cross-modal attention to remove potential sound source\ninterference at the estimated waveforms. To generalize to a new instrument or\nevent class, drawing inspiration from the text-prompt design, we insert an\nadditional query as an audio prompt while freezing the attention mechanism.\nExperimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that our iQuery improves\naudio-visual sound source separation performance.",

    "title": "A Transformer-Based User Satisfaction Prediction for Proactive  Interaction Mechanism in DuerOS",
    "abstract": "Recently, spoken dialogue systems have been widely deployed in a variety of\napplications, serving a huge number of end-users. A common issue is that the\nerrors resulting from noisy utterances, semantic misunderstandings, or lack of\nknowledge make it hard for a real system to respond properly, possibly leading\nto an unsatisfactory user experience. To avoid such a case, we consider a\nproactive interaction mechanism where the system predicts the user satisfaction\nwith the candidate response before giving it to the user. If the user is not\nlikely to be satisfied according to the prediction, the system will ask the\nuser a suitable question to determine the real intent of the user instead of\nproviding the response directly. With such an interaction with the user, the\nsystem can give a better response to the user. Previous models that predict the\nuser satisfaction are not applicable to DuerOS which is a large-scale\ncommercial dialogue system. They are based on hand-crafted features and thus\ncan hardly learn the complex patterns lying behind millions of conversations\nand temporal dependency in multiple turns of the conversation. Moreover, they\nare trained and evaluated on the benchmark datasets with adequate labels, which\nare expensive to obtain in a commercial dialogue system. To face these\nchallenges, we propose a pipeline to predict the user satisfaction to help\nDuerOS decide whether to ask for clarification in each turn. Specifically, we\npropose to first generate a large number of weak labels and then train a\ntransformer-based model to predict the user satisfaction with these weak\nlabels. Empirically, we deploy and evaluate our model on DuerOS, and observe a\n19% relative improvement on the accuracy of user satisfaction prediction and\n2.3% relative improvement on user experience.",

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation is one of the prominent strategies for handling both domain\nshift, that is widely encountered in large-scale land use/land cover map\ncalculation, and the scarcity of pixel-level ground truth that is crucial for\nsupervised semantic segmentation. Studies focusing on adversarial domain\nadaptation via re-styling source domain samples, commonly through generative\nadversarial networks, have reported varying levels of success, yet they suffer\nfrom semantic inconsistencies, visual corruptions, and often require a large\nnumber of target domain samples. In this letter, we propose a new unsupervised\ndomain adaptation method for the semantic segmentation of very high resolution\nimages, that i) leads to semantically consistent and noise-free images, ii)\noperates with a single target domain sample (i.e. one-shot) and iii) at a\nfraction of the number of parameters required from state-of-the-art methods.\nMore specifically an image-to-image translation paradigm is proposed, based on\nan encoder-decoder principle where latent content representations are mixed\nacross domains, and a perceptual network module and loss function is further\nintroduced to enforce semantic consistency.

We propose\ncircumventing this issue by directly finding latent knowledge inside the\ninternal activations of a language model in a purely unsupervised way.\nSpecifically, we introduce a method for accurately answering yes-no questions\ngiven only unlabeled model activations. It works by finding a direction in\nactivation space that satisfies logical consistency properties, such as that a\nstatement and its negation have opposite truth values. We show that despite\nusing no supervision and no model outputs, our method can recover diverse\nknowledge represented in large language models: across 6 models and 10\nquestion-answering datasets, it outperforms zero-shot accuracy by 4\\% on\naverage. We also find that it cuts prompt sensitivity in half and continues to\nmaintain high accuracy even when models are prompted to generate incorrect\nanswers.

    "abstract": "In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) related technology has\nexpanded knowledge in the area, bringing to light new problems and challenges\nthat require solutions. Furthermore, because the technology allows processes\nusually carried out by people to be automated, it is in great demand in\nindustrial sectors. The automation of these vehicles has been addressed in the\nliterature, applying different machine learning strategies. Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) is an automation framework that is frequently used to train\nautonomous agents. RL is a machine learning paradigm wherein an agent interacts\nwith an environment to solve a given task. However, learning autonomously can\nbe time consuming, computationally expensive, and may not be practical in\nhighly-complex scenarios. Interactive reinforcement learning allows an external\ntrainer to provide advice to an agent while it is learning a task. In this\nstudy, we set out to teach an RL agent to control a drone using reward-shaping\nand policy-shaping techniques simultaneously. Two simulated scenarios were\nproposed for the training; one without obstacles and one with obstacles. We\nalso studied the influence of each technique. The results show that an agent\ntrained simultaneously with both techniques obtains a lower reward than an\nagent trained using only a policy-based approach. Nevertheless, the agent\nachieves lower execution times and less dispersion during training.",

In this paper, we propose a general hierarchical\nframework to resolve the within-vision-range (WVR) air-to-air combat problem\nunder 6 dimensions of degree (6-DOF) dynamics. The core idea is to divide the\nwhole decision process into two loops and use reinforcement learning (RL) to\nsolve them separately. The outer loop takes into account the current combat\nsituation and decides the expected macro behavior of the aircraft according to\na combat strategy. Then the inner loop tracks the macro behavior with a flight\ncontroller by calculating the actual input signals for the aircraft. We design\nthe Markov decision process for both the outer loop strategy and inner loop\ncontroller, and train them by proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. For\nthe inner loop controller, we design an effective reward function to accurately\ntrack various macro behavior. For the outer loop strategy, we further adopt a\nfictitious self-play mechanism to improve the combat performance by constantly\ncombating against the historical strategies. Experiment results show that the\ninner loop controller can achieve better tracking performance than fine-tuned\nPID controller, and the outer loop strategy can perform complex maneuvers to\nget higher and higher winning rate, with the generation evolves.",

Using such\ndecomposition, personalized models can generate locally unseen labels while\npreserving the given style of the client and can predict the labels for all\nclients with high accuracy by training a simple linear classifier on the global\ncontent features. Furthermore, disentanglement enables other essential\napplications, such as data anonymization, by sharing only content.

    "abstract": "While machine learning models have achieved unprecedented success in\nreal-world applications, they might make biased/unfair decisions for specific\ndemographic groups and hence result in discriminative outcomes. Although\nresearch efforts have been devoted to measuring and mitigating bias, they\nmainly study bias from the result-oriented perspective while neglecting the\nbias encoded in the decision-making procedure. This results in their inability\nto capture procedure-oriented bias, which therefore limits the ability to have\na fully debiasing method. Fortunately, with the rapid development of\nexplainable machine learning, explanations for predictions are now available to\ngain insights into the procedure. In this work, we bridge the gap between\nfairness and explainability by presenting a novel perspective of\nprocedure-oriented fairness based on explanations. We identify the\nprocedure-based bias by measuring the gap of explanation quality between\ndifferent groups with Ratio-based and Value-based Explanation Fairness. The new\nmetrics further motivate us to design an optimization objective to mitigate the\nprocedure-based bias where we observe that it will also mitigate bias from the\nprediction. Based on our designed optimization objective, we propose a\nComprehensive Fairness Algorithm (CFA), which simultaneously fulfills multiple\nobjectives - improving traditional fairness, satisfying explanation fairness,\nand maintaining the utility performance. Extensive experiments on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CFA and highlight the\nimportance of considering fairness from the explainability perspective.

Here, we propose, \\texttt{phase2vec}, an\nembedding method that learns high-quality, physically-meaningful\nrepresentations of 2D dynamical systems without supervision.

The trained architecture can not only predict the\nequations of unseen data, but also, crucially, learns embeddings that respect\nthe underlying semantics of the embedded physical systems. We validate the\nquality of learned embeddings investigating the extent to which physical\ncategories of input data can be decoded from embeddings compared to standard\nblackbox classifiers and state-of-the-art time series classification\ntechniques.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant popularity in recent years\nand have proliferated into many applications. However, it is not well explored\nhow varied their behavior is under different learning paradigms. We compare\nViTs trained through different methods of supervision, and show that they learn\na diverse range of behaviors in terms of their attention, representations, and\ndownstream performance. We also discover ViT behaviors that are consistent\nacross supervision, including the emergence of Offset Local Attention Heads.\nThese are self-attention heads that attend to a token adjacent to the current\ntoken with a fixed directional offset, a phenomenon that to the best of our\nknowledge has not been highlighted in any prior work. Our analysis shows that\nViTs are highly flexible and learn to process local and global information in\ndifferent orders depending on their training method. We find that contrastive\nself-supervised methods learn features that are competitive with explicitly\nsupervised features, and they can even be superior for part-level tasks. We\nalso find that the representations of reconstruction-based models show\nnon-trivial similarity to contrastive self-supervised models. Finally, we show\nhow the \"best\" layer for a given task varies by both supervision method and\ntask, further demonstrating the differing order of information processing in\nViTs.",

Existing systems include\nwearables and pressure mats, but they have limited scalability. Recent studies\nhave developed vision-based systems to enable scalable, accurate in-home gait\nanalysis, but it faces privacy concerns due to the exposure of people's\nappearances. Our prior work developed footstep-induced structural vibration\nsensing for gait monitoring, which is device-free, wide-ranged, and perceived\nas more privacy-friendly. Although it has succeeded in temporal gait event\nextraction, it shows limited performance for spatial gait parameter estimation\ndue to imprecise footstep localization. In particular, the localization error\nmainly comes from the estimation error of the wave arrival time at the\nvibration sensors and its error propagation to wave velocity estimations.\nTherefore, we present GaitVibe+, a vibration-based footstep localization method\nfused with temporarily installed cameras for in-home gait analysis. Our method\nhas two stages: fusion and operating. In the fusion stage, both cameras and\nvibration sensors are installed to record only a few trials of the subject's\nfootstep data, through which we characterize the uncertainty in wave arrival\ntime and model the wave velocity profiles for the given structure. In the\noperating stage, we remove the camera to preserve privacy at home. The footstep\nlocalization is conducted by estimating the time difference of arrival (TDoA)\nover multiple vibration sensors, whose accuracy is improved through the reduced\nuncertainty and velocity modeling during the fusion stage. We evaluate\nGaitVibe+ through a real-world experiment with 50 walking trials.

    "abstract": "With the increasing enrichment and development of the financial derivatives\nmarket, the frequency of transactions is also faster and faster. Due to human\nlimitations, algorithms and automatic trading have recently become the focus of\ndiscussion. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional LSTM neural network based\non an attention mechanism, which is based on two popular assets, gold and\nbitcoin. In terms of Feature Engineering, on the one hand, we add traditional\ntechnical factors, and at the same time, we combine time series models to\ndevelop factors. In the selection of model parameters, we finally chose a\ntwo-layer deep learning network. According to AUC measurement, the accuracy of\nbitcoin and gold is 71.94% and 73.03% respectively. Using the forecast results,\nwe achieved a return of 1089.34% in two years. At the same time, we also\ncompare the attention Bi-LSTM model proposed in this paper with the traditional\nmodel, and the results show that our model has the best performance in this\ndata set. Finally, we discuss the significance of the model and the\nexperimental results, as well as the possible improvement direction in the\nfuture.",

    "abstract": "The primary aim of this research was to find a model that best predicts which\nfallen angel bonds would either potentially rise up back to investment grade\nbonds and which ones would fall into bankruptcy. To implement the solution, we\nthought that the ideal method would be to create an optimal machine learning\nmodel that could predict bankruptcies. Among the many machine learning models\nout there we decided to pick four classification methods: logistic regression,\nKNN, SVM, and NN. We also utilized an automated methods of Google Cloud's\nmachine learning.\nThe results of our model comparisons showed that the models did not predict\nbankruptcies very well on the original data set with the exception of Google\nCloud's machine learning having a high precision score. However, our\nover-sampled and feature selection data set did perform very well. This could\nlikely be due to the model being over-fitted to match the narrative of the\nover-sampled data (as in, it does not accurately predict data outside of this\ndata set quite well). Therefore, we were not able to create a model that we are\nconfident that would predict bankruptcies.\nHowever, we were able to find value out of this project in two key ways. The\nfirst is that Google Cloud's machine learning model in every metric and in\nevery data set either outperformed or performed on par with the other models.\nThe second is that we found that utilizing feature selection did not reduce\npredictive power that much. This means that we can reduce the amount of data to\ncollect for future experimentation regarding predicting bankruptcies.",

In this work we consider the violation of the\nclassical no-interference assumption, meaning that the treatment of one\nindividuals might affect the outcomes of another. To make interference\ntractable, we consider a known network that describes how interference may\ntravel. However, unlike previous work in this area, the radius (and intensity)\nof the interference experienced by a unit is unknown and can depend on\ndifferent sub-networks of those treated and untreated that are connected to\nthis unit.\nWe study estimators for the average direct treatment effect on the treated in\nsuch a setting. The proposed estimator builds upon a Lepski-like procedure that\nsearches over the possible relevant radii and treatment assignment patterns. In\ncontrast to previous work, the proposed procedure aims to approximate the\nrelevant network interference patterns. We establish oracle inequalities and\ncorresponding adaptive rates for the estimation of the interference function.\nWe leverage such estimates to propose and analyze two estimators for the\naverage direct treatment effect on the treated.

    "abstract": "We consider semi-supervised binary classification for applications in which\ndata points are naturally grouped (e.g., survey responses grouped by state) and\nthe labeled data is biased (e.g., survey respondents are not representative of\nthe population). The groups overlap in the feature space and consequently the\ninput-output patterns are related across the groups. To model the inherent\nstructure in such data, we assume the partition-projected class-conditional\ninvariance across groups, defined in terms of the group-agnostic feature space.\nWe demonstrate that under this assumption, the group carries additional\ninformation about the class, over the group-agnostic features, with provably\nimproved area under the ROC curve. Further assuming invariance of\npartition-projected class-conditional distributions across both labeled and\nunlabeled data, we derive a semi-supervised algorithm that explicitly leverages\nthe structure to learn an optimal, group-aware, probability-calibrated\nclassifier, despite the bias in the labeled data. Experiments on synthetic and\nreal data demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm over suitable baselines and\nablative models, spanning standard supervised and semi-supervised learning\napproaches, with and without incorporating the group directly as a feature.",

    "abstract": "Several Artificial Intelligence based heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms\nhave been developed so far. These algorithms have shown their superiority\ntowards solving complex problems from different domains. However, it is\nnecessary to critically validate these algorithms for solving real-world\nconstrained optimization problems. The search behavior in those problems is\ndifferent as it involves large number of linear, nonlinear and non-convex type\nequality and inequality constraints. In this work a 57 real-world constrained\noptimization problems test suite is solved using two constrained metaheuristic\nalgorithms originated from a socio-based Cohort Intelligence (CI) algorithm.\nThe first CI-based algorithm incorporates a self-adaptive penalty function\napproach i.e., CI-SAPF. The second algorithm combines CI-SAPF with the\nintrinsic properties of the physics-based Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO)\nreferred to CI-SAPF-CBO. The results obtained from CI-SAPF and CI-SAPF-CBO are\ncompared with other constrained optimization algorithms. The superiority of the\nproposed algorithms is discussed in details followed by future directions to\nevolve the constrained handling techniques.",

    "abstract": "The Multi-Objective Shortest Path Problem, typically posed on a graph,\ndetermines a set of paths from a start vertex to a destination vertex while\noptimizing multiple objectives. In general, there does not exist a single\nsolution path that can simultaneously optimize all the objectives and the\nproblem thus seeks to find a set of so-called Pareto-optimal solutions. To\naddress this problem, several Multi-Objective A* (MOA*) algorithms were\nrecently developed to quickly compute solutions with quality guarantees.\nHowever, these MOA* algorithms often suffer from high memory usage, especially\nwhen the branching factor (i.e., the number of neighbors of any vertex) of the\ngraph is large. This work thus aims at reducing the high memory consumption of\nMOA* with little increase in the runtime. In this paper, we first extend the\nnotion of \"partial expansion\" (PE) from single-objective to multi-objective and\nthen fuse this new PE technique with EMOA*, a recent runtime efficient MOA*\nalgorithm. Furthermore, the resulting algorithm PE-EMOA* can balance between\nruntime and memory efficiency by tuning a user-defined hyper-parameter.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks that can recover latent dynamics from recorded\nneural activity may provide a powerful avenue for identifying and interpreting\nthe dynamical motifs underlying biological computation. Given that neural\nvariance alone does not uniquely determine a latent dynamical system,\ninterpretable architectures should prioritize accurate and low-dimensional\nlatent dynamics. In this work, we evaluated the performance of sequential\nautoencoders (SAEs) in recovering three latent chaotic attractors from\nsimulated neural datasets. We found that SAEs with widely-used recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN)-based dynamics were unable to infer accurate rates at the true\nlatent state dimensionality, and that larger RNNs relied upon dynamical\nfeatures not present in the data. On the other hand, SAEs with neural ordinary\ndifferential equation (NODE)-based dynamics inferred accurate rates at the true\nlatent state dimensionality, while also recovering latent trajectories and\nfixed point structure. We attribute this finding to the fact that NODEs allow\nuse of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) of arbitrary capacity to model the vector\nfield. Decoupling the expressivity of the dynamics model from its latent\ndimensionality enables NODEs to learn the requisite low-D dynamics where RNN\ncells fail. The suboptimal interpretability of widely-used RNN-based dynamics\nmay motivate substitution for alternative architectures, such as NODE, that\nenable learning of accurate dynamics in low-dimensional latent spaces.",

    "abstract": "A link stream is a set of triplets $(t, u, v)$ indicating that $u$ and $v$\ninteracted at time $t$. Link streams model numerous datasets and their proper\nstudy is crucial in many applications. In practice, raw link streams are often\naggregated or transformed into time series or graphs where decisions are made.\nYet, it remains unclear how the dynamical and structural information of a raw\nlink stream carries into the transformed object. This work shows that it is\npossible to shed light into this question by studying link streams via\nalgebraically linear graph and signal operators, for which we introduce a novel\nlinear matrix framework for the analysis of link streams. We show that, due to\ntheir linearity, most methods in signal processing can be easily adopted by our\nframework to analyze the time/frequency information of link streams. However,\nthe availability of linear graph methods to analyze relational/structural\ninformation is limited. We address this limitation by developing (i) a new\nbasis for graphs that allow us to decompose them into structures at different\nresolution levels; and (ii) filters for graphs that allow us to change their\nstructural information in a controlled manner. By plugging-in these\ndevelopments and their time-domain counterpart into our framework, we are able\nto (i) obtain a new basis for link streams that allow us to represent them in a\nfrequency-structure domain; and (ii) show that many interesting transformations\nto link streams, like the aggregation of interactions or their embedding into a\neuclidean space, can be seen as simple filters in our frequency-structure\ndomain.",

    "abstract": "As the demand for higher data throughput in coherent optical communication\nsystems increases, we need to find ways to increase capacity in existing and\nfuture optical communication links. To address the demand for higher spectral\nefficiencies, we apply end-to-end optimization for joint geometric and\nprobabilistic constellation shaping in the presence of Wiener phase noise and\ncarrier phase estimation. Our approach follows state-of-the-art bitwise\nauto-encoders, which require a differentiable implementation of all operations\nbetween transmitter and receiver, including the DSP algorithms. In this work,\nwe show how to modify the ubiquitous blind phase search (BPS) algorithm, a\npopular carrier phase estimation algorithm, to make it differentiable and\ninclude it in the end-to-end constellation shaping. By leveraging joint\ngeometric and probabilistic constellation shaping, we are able to obtain a\nrobust and pilot-free modulation scheme improving the performance of 64-ary\ncommunication systems by at least 0.1bit/symbol compared to square QAM\nconstellations with neural demappers and by 0.05 bit/symbol compared to\npreviously presented approaches applying only geometric constellation shaping.",
