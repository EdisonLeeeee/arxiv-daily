    "abstract": "We study fair multi-objective reinforcement learning in which an agent must\nlearn a policy that simultaneously achieves high reward on multiple dimensions\nof a vector-valued reward. Motivated by the fair resource allocation\nliterature, we model this as an expected welfare maximization problem, for some\nnon-linear fair welfare function of the vector of long-term cumulative rewards.\nOne canonical example of such a function is the Nash Social Welfare, or\ngeometric mean, the log transform of which is also known as the Proportional\nFairness objective. We show that even approximately optimal optimization of the\nexpected Nash Social Welfare is computationally intractable even in the tabular\ncase. Nevertheless, we provide a novel adaptation of Q-learning that combines\nnon-linear scalarized learning updates and non-stationary action selection to\nlearn effective policies for optimizing nonlinear welfare functions. We show\nthat our algorithm is provably convergent, and we demonstrate experimentally\nthat our approach outperforms techniques based on linear scalarization,\nmixtures of optimal linear scalarizations, or stationary action selection for\nthe Nash Social Welfare Objective.",

Nonlinear approximation methods, such as neural networks, were shown\nto be very efficient in approximating high-dimensional functions.

    "abstract": "Incivility remains a major challenge for online discussion platforms, to such\nan extent that even conversations between well-intentioned users can often\nderail into uncivil behavior. Traditionally, platforms have relied on\nmoderators to -- with or without algorithmic assistance -- take corrective\nactions such as removing comments or banning users. In this work we propose a\ncomplementary paradigm that directly empowers users by proactively enhancing\ntheir awareness about existing tension in the conversation they are engaging in\nand actively guides them as they are drafting their replies to avoid further\nescalation.\nAs a proof of concept for this paradigm, we design an algorithmic tool that\nprovides such proactive information directly to users, and conduct a user study\nin a popular discussion platform. Through a mixed methods approach combining\nsurveys with a randomized controlled experiment, we uncover qualitative and\nquantitative insights regarding how the participants utilize and react to this\ninformation. Most participants report finding this proactive paradigm valuable,\nnoting that it helps them to identify tension that they may have otherwise\nmissed and prompts them to further reflect on their own replies and to revise\nthem. These effects are corroborated by a comparison of how the participants\ndraft their reply when our tool warns them that their conversation is at risk\nof derailing into uncivil behavior versus in a control condition where the tool\nis disabled. These preliminary findings highlight the potential of this\nuser-centered paradigm and point to concrete directions for future\nimplementations.",

Once trained, our model\njointly predicts face textures in UV-space, along with expression parameters to\ncapture both geometry and texture changes in facial expressions in a single\nforward pass.

    "abstract": "Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a new and challenging computer vision\ntask that bridges the gap between classic object detection (OD) benchmarks and\nobject detection in the real world. In addition to detecting and classifying\nseen/labeled objects, OWOD algorithms are expected to detect novel/unknown\nobjects - which can be classified and incrementally learned. In standard OD,\nobject proposals not overlapping with a labeled object are automatically\nclassified as background. Therefore, simply applying OD methods to OWOD fails\nas unknown objects would be predicted as background. The challenge of detecting\nunknown objects stems from the lack of supervision in distinguishing unknown\nobjects and background object proposals. Previous OWOD methods have attempted\nto overcome this issue by generating supervision using pseudo-labeling -\nhowever, unknown object detection has remained low. Probabilistic/generative\nmodels may provide a solution for this challenge.

    "abstract": "The Human-Autonomy Teaming paradigm (HAT) has recently emerged to model and\ndesign hybrid teams, where a human operator must cooperate with an artificial\nagent, able to independently evolve in dynamic and uncertain situations. An\nimportant challenge in HAT is to transform autonomous systems into better\nteammates, capable of joining humans in highly interdependent activities. The\npresented works explore two main avenues, supported by industrial\ncollaborations (in the domain of transportation and industrial systems),\nacademic partnerships (especially with South Australian universities), and with\nthe supervision PhD students. The first axis deals with the monitoring of\ncognitive states, to equip the machine with an ability to detect when human\nface difficulties. To address this question, a global approach is proposed to\nclassify operators mental workload from the fusion of multisourced\nphysiological and behavioral data. The second axis focused on the mechanisms\nfor adapting human-autonomy teaming, making machine more compatible with human.\nTwo kinds of solution are explored. One focused on the offline enhancement of\nthe know-how-to-cooperate of machines, with the aid of CWA method and MDE\ntechniques. The other deals with online adaptation of human-machine\ncooperation, where autonomous system can be considered inside the team - as a\nteammate - or above the team-as a coach. Finally, new research directions are\nopened, supported by ongoing initiatives in France and abroad. These\nperspectives relate to the consolidation of a multilevel approach for cognitive\nstate monitoring, the building of a transparent dialogue between human and\nautonomy, a deeper consideration of transitional and longitudinal situations in\nHAT, and the scale-up challenge of studying HAT with human teams.",

    "abstract": "Safe and smooth robot motion around obstacles is an essential skill for\nautonomous robots, especially when operating around people and other robots.\nConventionally, due to real-time operation requirements and onboard computation\nlimitations, many robot motion planning and control methods follow a two-step\napproach: first construct a (e.g., piecewise linear) collision-free reference\npath for a simplified robot model, and then execute the reference plan via\npath-following control for a more accurate and complex robot model. A challenge\nof such a decoupled robot motion planning and control method for highly dynamic\nrobotic systems is ensuring the safety of path-following control as well as the\nsuccessful completion of the reference plan. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel dynamical systems approach for online closed-loop time parametrization,\ncalled $\\textit{a time governor}$, of a reference path for provably correct and\nsafe path-following control based on feedback motion prediction, where the\nsafety of robot motion under path-following control is continuously monitored\nusing predicted robot motion. After introducing the general framework of time\ngovernors for safe path following, we present an example application for the\nfully actuated high-order robot dynamics using\nproportional-and-higher-order-derivative (PhD) path-following control whose\nfeedback motion prediction is performed by Lyapunov ellipsoids and Vandemonde\nsimplexes.

By fusing on the channels, the model is\nable to more effectively align the tokens compared to standard methods. These\nmultimodal representations, which we call compound tokens are generated with\ncross-attention transformer layers. First, vision tokens are used as queries to\nretrieve compatible text tokens through cross-attention. We then chain the\nvision tokens and the queried text tokens along the channel dimension.

    "abstract": "The mediocre performance of conventional federated learning (FL) over\nheterogeneous data has been facilitating personalized FL solutions, where,\nunlike conventional FL which trains a single global consensus model, different\nmodels are allowed for different clients. However, in most existing\npersonalized FL algorithms, the collaborative knowledge across the federation\nwas only implicitly passed to the clients in ways such as model aggregation or\nregularization. We observed that this implicit knowledge transfer fails to\nmaximize the potential value of each client's empirical risk toward other\nclients. Based on our observation, in this work, we propose Personalized Global\nFederated Learning (PGFed), a novel personalized FL framework that enables each\nclient to personalize its own global objective by explicitly and adaptively\naggregating the empirical risks of itself and other clients. To avoid massive\n($O(N^2)$) communication overhead and potential privacy leakage, each client's\nrisk is estimated through a first-order approximation for other clients'\nadaptive risk aggregation. On top of PGFed, we develop a momentum upgrade,\ndubbed PGFedMo, to more efficiently utilize clients' empirical risks. Our\nextensive experiments under different federated settings with benchmark\ndatasets show consistent improvements of PGFed over the compared\nstate-of-the-art alternatives.",

We further show that this\nalgorithm can be plugged into an algorithmic scheme by Guibas et al., yielding\nan algorithm for a relaxed variant of the minimum-link ordered stabbing path\nproblem that achieves approximation factor 2 with respect to the number of\nlinks. We conclude with experimental evaluations of the latter two algorithms,\nshowing practical applicability.",

    "abstract": "Although various methods have been proposed for multi-label classification,\nmost approaches still follow the feature learning mechanism of the single-label\n(multi-class) classification, namely, learning a shared image feature to\nclassify multiple labels. However, we find this\nOne-shared-Feature-for-Multiple-Labels (OFML) mechanism is not conducive to\nlearning discriminative label features and makes the model non-robustness. For\nthe first time, we mathematically prove that the inferiority of the OFML\nmechanism is that the optimal learned image feature cannot maintain high\nsimilarities with multiple classifiers simultaneously in the context of\nminimizing cross-entropy loss. To address the limitations of the OFML\nmechanism, we introduce the One-specific-Feature-for-One-Label (OFOL) mechanism\nand propose a novel disentangled label feature learning (DLFL) framework to\nlearn a disentangled representation for each label. The specificity of the\nframework lies in a feature disentangle module, which contains learnable\nsemantic queries and a Semantic Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA) module.\nSpecifically, learnable semantic queries maintain semantic consistency between\ndifferent images of the same label. The SSCA module localizes the label-related\nspatial regions and aggregates located region features into the corresponding\nlabel feature to achieve feature disentanglement. We achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on eight datasets of three tasks, \\ie, multi-label classification,\npedestrian attribute recognition, and continual multi-label learning.",

We sought to perform topic modeling to identify robust topics of\ndiscussion within a large cohort of social work notes.

The LDA topic modeling analysis extracted 11\ntopics related to social determinants of health risk factors including\nfinancial status, abuse history, social support, risk of death, and mental\nhealth.

Therefore, this\npaper addresses the conditions for estimating sensitivities of voltage\nmagnitudes with respect to complex (active and reactive) electric power\ninjections based on sensor measurements. These sensitivities represent\nsubmatrices of the inverse power flow Jacobian. We extend previous results to\nshow that the sensitivities of a bus voltage magnitude with respect to active\npower injections are unique and different from those with respect to reactive\npower. The classical Newton-Raphson power flow model is used to derive a novel\nrepresentation of bus voltage magnitudes as an underdetermined linear operator\nof the active and reactive power injections; parameterized by the bus power\nfactors. Two conditions that ensure the existence of unique complex power\ninjections given voltage magnitudes are established for this underdetermined\nlinear system, thereby compressing the solution space. The first is a\nsufficient condition based on the bus power factors. The second is a necessary\nand sufficient condition based on the system eigenvalues. We use matrix\ncompletion theory to develop estimation methods for recovering sensitivity\nmatrices with varying levels of sensor availability.

To address this situation, we propose an\napproach that can automatically detect code element references that survive in\nthe documentation after all source code instances have been deleted. In this\nwork, we analysed over 3,000 GitHub projects and found that most projects\ncontain at least one outdated code element reference at some point in their\nhistory. We submitted GitHub issues to real-world projects containing outdated\nreferences detected by our approach, some of which have already led to\ndocumentation fixes.

Computational\nlinguists have capitalized on this fact to build large language models (LLMs)\nthat acquire co-occurrence-based knowledge from language corpora. LLMs achieve\nimpressive performance on many tasks, but the robustness of their world\nknowledge has been questioned. Here, we ask: do LLMs acquire generalized\nknowledge about real-world events? Using curated sets of minimal sentence pairs\n(n=1215), we tested whether LLMs are more likely to generate plausible event\ndescriptions compared to their implausible counterparts. We found that LLMs\nsystematically distinguish possible and impossible events (The teacher bought\nthe laptop vs. The laptop bought the teacher) but fall short of human\nperformance when distinguishing likely and unlikely events (The nanny tutored\nthe boy vs. The boy tutored the nanny). In follow-up analyses, we show that (i)\nLLM scores are driven by both plausibility and surface-level sentence features,\n(ii) LLMs generalize well across syntactic sentence variants (active vs\npassive) but less well across semantic sentence variants (synonymous\nsentences), (iii) some, but not all LLM deviations from ground-truth labels\nalign with crowdsourced human judgments, and (iv) explicit event plausibility\ninformation emerges in middle LLM layers and remains high thereafter. Overall,\nour analyses reveal a gap in LLMs' event knowledge, highlighting their\nlimitations as generalized knowledge bases.

One of the\nchallenges of this task is assembling information from various posts into an\noverall profile for each user. While many previous solutions simply concatenate\nthe posts into a long document and then encode the document by sequential or\nhierarchical models, they introduce unwarranted orders for the posts, which may\nmislead the models. In this paper, we propose a dynamic deep graph\nconvolutional network (D-DGCN) to overcome the above limitation. Specifically,\nwe design a learn-to-connect approach that adopts a dynamic multi-hop structure\ninstead of a deterministic structure, and combine it with a DGCN module to\nautomatically learn the connections between posts. The modules of post encoder,\nlearn-to-connect, and DGCN are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner.\nExperimental results on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets show the superior\nperformance of D-DGCN to state-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "As a novel distributed learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) faces\nserious challenges in dealing with massive clients with heterogeneous data\ndistribution and computation and communication resources. Various\nclient-variance-reduction schemes and client sampling strategies have been\nrespectively introduced to improve the robustness of FL. Among others,\nprimal-dual algorithms such as the alternating direction of method multipliers\n(ADMM) have been found being resilient to data distribution and outperform most\nof the primal-only FL algorithms. However, the reason behind remains a mystery\nstill. In this paper, we firstly reveal the fact that the federated ADMM is\nessentially a client-variance-reduced algorithm. While this explains the\ninherent robustness of federated ADMM, the vanilla version of it lacks the\nability to be adaptive to the degree of client heterogeneity. Besides, the\nglobal model at the server under client sampling is biased which slows down the\npractical convergence. To go beyond ADMM, we propose a novel primal-dual FL\nalgorithm, termed FedVRA, that allows one to adaptively control the\nvariance-reduction level and biasness of the global model. In addition, FedVRA\nunifies several representative FL algorithms in the sense that they are either\nspecial instances of FedVRA or are close to it. Extensions of FedVRA to\nsemi/un-supervised learning are also presented. Experiments based on\n(semi-)supervised image classification tasks demonstrate superiority of FedVRA\nover the existing schemes in learning scenarios with massive heterogeneous\nclients and client sampling.",

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation is a challenging problem on which deep neural\nnetworks have demonstrated great potential. However, depth maps predicted by\nexisting deep models usually lack fine-grained details due to the convolution\noperations and the down-samplings in networks. We find that increasing input\nresolution is helpful to preserve more local details while the estimation at\nlow resolution is more accurate globally. Therefore, we propose a novel depth\nmap fusion module to combine the advantages of estimations with\nmulti-resolution inputs. Instead of merging the low- and high-resolution\nestimations equally, we adopt the core idea of Poisson fusion, trying to\nimplant the gradient domain of high-resolution depth into the low-resolution\ndepth. While classic Poisson fusion requires a fusion mask as supervision, we\npropose a self-supervised framework based on guided image filtering. We\ndemonstrate that this gradient-based composition performs much better at noisy\nimmunity, compared with the state-of-the-art depth map fusion method. Our\nlightweight depth fusion is one-shot and runs in real-time, making our method\n80X faster than a state-of-the-art depth fusion method.

To reduce\nthe compute time overhead of private learning, we show that \\emph{per-layer\nclipping}, where the gradient of each neural network layer is clipped\nseparately, allows clipping to be performed in conjunction with backpropagation\nin differentially private optimization. This results in private learning that\nis as memory-efficient and almost as fast per training update as non-private\nlearning for many workflows of interest.

    "abstract": "Most cross-device federated learning (FL) studies focus on the\nmodel-homogeneous setting where the global server model and local client models\nare identical. However, such constraint not only excludes low-end clients who\nwould otherwise make unique contributions to model training but also restrains\nclients from training large models due to on-device resource bottlenecks. In\nthis work, we propose FedRolex, a partial training (PT)-based approach that\nenables model-heterogeneous FL and can train a global server model larger than\nthe largest client model. At its core, FedRolex employs a rolling sub-model\nextraction scheme that allows different parts of the global server model to be\nevenly trained, which mitigates the client drift induced by the inconsistency\nbetween individual client models and server model architectures. We show that\nFedRolex outperforms state-of-the-art PT-based model-heterogeneous FL methods\n(e.g. Federated Dropout) and reduces the gap between model-heterogeneous and\nmodel-homogeneous FL, especially under the large-model large-dataset regime. In\naddition, we provide theoretical statistical analysis on its advantage over\nFederated Dropout and evaluate FedRolex on an emulated real-world device\ndistribution to show that FedRolex can enhance the inclusiveness of FL and\nboost the performance of low-end devices that would otherwise not benefit from\nFL.

    "abstract": "It is crucial to choose the appropriate scale in order to build an effective\nand informational representation of a complex system. Scientists carefully\nchoose the scales for their experiments to extract the variables that describe\nthe causalities in the system. They found that the coarse scale(macro) is\nsometimes more causal and informative than the numerous-parameter\nobservations(micro). The phenomenon that the causality emerges by\ncoarse-graining is called Causal Emergence(CE). Based on information theory, a\nnumber of recent works quantitatively showed that CE indeed happens while\ncoarse-graining a micro model to the macro. However, the existing works have\nnot discussed the question of why and when the CE happens. We quantitatively\nanalyze the redistribution of uncertainties for coarse-graining and suggest\nthat the redistribution of uncertainties is the cause of causal emergence. We\nfurther analyze the thresholds that determine if CE happens or not. From the\nregularity of the transition probability matrix(TPM) of discrete systems, the\nmathematical expressions of the model properties are derived. The values of\nthresholds for different operations are computed. The results provide the\ncritical and specific conditions of CE as helpful suggestions for choosing the\nproper coarse-graining operation. The results also provided a new way to better\nunderstand the nature of causality and causal emergence.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has emerged as a powerful solution for\nthe domain shift problem via transferring the knowledge from a labeled source\ndomain to a shifted unlabeled target domain. Despite the prevalence of UDA for\nvisual applications, it remains relatively less explored for time-series\napplications. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight contrastive domain\nadaptation framework called CoTMix for time-series data. Unlike existing\napproaches that either use statistical distances or adversarial techniques, we\nleverage contrastive learning solely to mitigate the distribution shift across\nthe different domains. Specifically, we propose a novel temporal mixup strategy\nto generate two intermediate augmented views for the source and target domains.\nSubsequently, we leverage contrastive learning to maximize the similarity\nbetween each domain and its corresponding augmented view. The generated views\nconsider the temporal dynamics of time-series data during the adaptation\nprocess while inheriting the semantics among the two domains. Hence, we\ngradually push both domains towards a common intermediate space, mitigating the\ndistribution shift across them. Extensive experiments conducted on four\nreal-world time-series datasets show that our approach can significantly\noutperform all state-of-the-art UDA methods.

    "abstract": "Multi-Exit models (MEMs) use an early-exit strategy to improve the accuracy\nand efficiency of deep neural networks (DNNs) by allowing samples to exit the\nnetwork before the last layer. However, the effectiveness of MEMs in the\npresence of distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. Our work examines\nhow distribution shifts generated by common image corruptions affect the\naccuracy/efficiency of MEMs. We find that under common corruptions,\nearly-exiting at the first correct exit reduces the inference cost and provides\na significant boost in accuracy ( 10%) over exiting at the last layer. However,\nwith realistic early-exit strategies, which do not assume knowledge about the\ncorrect exits, MEMs still reduce inference cost but provide a marginal\nimprovement in accuracy (1%) compared to exiting at the last layer. Moreover,\nthe presence of distribution shift widens the gap between an MEM's maximum\nclassification accuracy and realistic early-exit strategies by 5% on average\ncompared with the gap on in-distribution data. Our empirical analysis shows\nthat the lack of calibration due to a distribution shift increases the\nsusceptibility of such early-exit strategies to exit early and increases\nmisclassification rates. Furthermore, the lack of calibration increases the\ninconsistency in the predictions of the model across exits, leading to both\ninefficient inference and more misclassifications compared with evaluation on\nin-distribution data. Finally, we propose two metrics, underthinking and\noverthinking, that quantify the different behavior of practical early-exit\nstrategy under distribution shifts, and provide insights into improving the\npractical utility of MEMs.",

Several research have focussed on different kinds of\nfailures, such as, cascades, their reasons and ways to avoid them. This paper\nconsiders failures in a specific type of MLCN where the lower layer provides\nservices to the higher layer without cross layer interaction, typical of a\ncomputer network. A three layer MLCN is constructed with the same set of nodes\nwhere each layer has different characteristics, the bottom most layer is\nErdos-Renyi (ER) random graph with shortest path hop count among the nodes as\ngaussian, the middle layer is ER graph with higher number of edges from the\nprevious, and the top most layer is scale free graph with even higher number of\nedges. Both edge and node failures are considered. Failures happen with\ndecreasing order of centralities of edges and nodes in static batch mode and\nwhen the centralities change dynamically with progressive failures. Emergent\npattern of three key parameters, namely, average shortest path length (ASPL),\ntotal shortest path count (TSPC) and total number of edges (TNE) for all the\nthree layers after node or edge failures are studied.

    "abstract": "Although existing multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms have obtained\ncompetitive performance on various benchmarks, almost all of them train and\nvalidate models on the same domain. The domain generalization problem of MOT is\nhardly studied. To bridge this gap, we first draw the observation that the\nhigh-level information contained in natural language is domain invariant to\ndifferent tracking domains. Based on this observation, we propose to introduce\nnatural language representation into visual MOT models for boosting the domain\ngeneralization ability. However, it is infeasible to label every tracking\ntarget with a textual description. To tackle this problem, we design two\nmodules, namely visual context prompting (VCP) and visual-language mixing\n(VLM). Specifically, VCP generates visual prompts based on the input frames.\nVLM joints the information in the generated visual prompts and the textual\nprompts from a pre-defined Trackbook to obtain instance-level pseudo textual\ndescription, which is domain invariant to different tracking scenes. Through\ntraining models on MOT17 and validating them on MOT20, we observe that the\npseudo textual descriptions generated by our proposed modules improve the\ngeneralization performance of query-based trackers by large margins.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to fully supervised methods using pixel-wise mask labels,\nbox-supervised instance segmentation takes advantage of simple box annotations,\nwhich has recently attracted increasing research attention. This paper presents\na novel single-shot instance segmentation approach, namely Box2Mask, which\nintegrates the classical level-set evolution model into deep neural network\nlearning to achieve accurate mask prediction with only bounding box\nsupervision. Specifically, both the input image and its deep features are\nemployed to evolve the level-set curves implicitly, and a local consistency\nmodule based on a pixel affinity kernel is used to mine the local context and\nspatial relations. Two types of single-stage frameworks, i.e., CNN-based and\ntransformer-based frameworks, are developed to empower the level-set evolution\nfor box-supervised instance segmentation, and each framework consists of three\nessential components: instance-aware decoder, box-level matching assignment and\nlevel-set evolution. By minimizing the level-set energy function, the mask map\nof each instance can be iteratively optimized within its bounding box\nannotation. The experimental results on five challenging testbeds, covering\ngeneral scenes, remote sensing, medical and scene text images, demonstrate the\noutstanding performance of our proposed Box2Mask approach for box-supervised\ninstance segmentation. In particular, with the Swin-Transformer large backbone,\nour Box2Mask obtains 42.4% mask AP on COCO, which is on par with the recently\ndeveloped fully mask-supervised methods.

    "abstract": "Ultra-fine entity typing (UFET) aims to predict a wide range of type phrases\nthat correctly describe the categories of a given entity mention in a sentence.\nMost recent works infer each entity type independently, ignoring the\ncorrelations between types, e.g., when an entity is inferred as a president, it\nshould also be a politician and a leader. To this end, we use an undirected\ngraphical model called pairwise conditional random field (PCRF) to formulate\nthe UFET problem, in which the type variables are not only unarily influenced\nby the input but also pairwisely relate to all the other type variables. We use\nvarious modern backbones for entity typing to compute unary potentials, and\nderive pairwise potentials from type phrase representations that both capture\nprior semantic information and facilitate accelerated inference. We use\nmean-field variational inference for efficient type inference on very large\ntype sets and unfold it as a neural network module to enable end-to-end\ntraining. Experiments on UFET show that the Neural-PCRF consistently\noutperforms its backbones with little cost and results in a competitive\nperformance against cross-encoder based SOTA while being thousands of times\nfaster. We also find Neural- PCRF effective on a widely used fine-grained\nentity typing dataset with a smaller type set. We pack Neural-PCRF as a network\nmodule that can be plugged onto multi-label type classifiers with ease and\nrelease it in https://github.com/modelscope/adaseq/tree/master/examples/NPCRF.",

    "abstract": "Dialogue systems can leverage large pre-trained language models and knowledge\nto generate fluent and informative responses. However, these models are still\nprone to produce hallucinated responses not supported by the input source,\nwhich greatly hinders their application. The heterogeneity between external\nknowledge and dialogue context challenges representation learning and source\nintegration, and further contributes to unfaithfulness. To handle this\nchallenge and generate more faithful responses, this paper presents RHO\n($\\rho$) utilizing the representations of linked entities and relation\npredicates from a knowledge graph (KG). We propose (1) local knowledge\ngrounding to combine textual embeddings with the corresponding KG embeddings;\nand (2) global knowledge grounding to equip RHO with multi-hop reasoning\nabilities via the attention mechanism. In addition, we devise a response\nre-ranking technique based on walks over KG sub-graphs for better\nconversational reasoning. Experimental results on OpenDialKG show that our\napproach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both automatic\nand human evaluation by a large margin, especially in hallucination reduction\n(17.54% in FeQA).",

Formally, a temporal graph is a sequence <G_1,...,G_L> of\ngraphs with V(G_t) = V(G) and E(G_t) a subset of E(G) for all t in [L] and some\nunderlying graph G, and a temporal walk is a time-respecting sequence of\nedge-traversals. We consider both the strict variant, in which edges must be\ntraversed in strictly increasing timesteps, and the non-strict variant, in\nwhich an arbitrary number of edges can be traversed in each timestep. For both\nvariants, we give FPT algorithms for the problem of finding a temporal walk\nthat visits a given set X of vertices, parameterized by |X|, and for the\nproblem of finding a temporal walk that visits at least k distinct vertices in\nV(G), parameterized by k.

Directly modeling an individual battery using a computational\nmodels based on physical rules can be of low-efficiency, in terms of the\ndifficulties in build such a model and the computational effort of tuning and\nrunning it especially on the edge. With the rapid development of sensor\ntechnology (to provide more insights into the system) and machine learning (to\nbuild capable yet fast model), it is now possible to directly build a\ndata-riven model of the battery health status using the data collected from\nhistorical battery data (being possibly local and remote) to predict local\nbattery health status in the future accurately. Nevertheless, most data-driven\nmethods are trained based on the local battery data and lack the ability to\nextract common properties, such as generations and degradation, in the life\nspan of other remote batteries. In this paper, we utilize a Gaussian process\ndynamical model (GPDM) to build a data-driven model of battery health status\nand propose a knowledge transfer method to extract common properties in the\nlife span of all batteries to accurately predict the battery health status with\nand without features extracted from the local battery.

    "abstract": "Abstractive summarization is the process of generating a summary given a\ndocument as input. Although significant progress has been made, the factual\ninconsistency between the document and the generated summary still limits its\npractical applications. Previous work found that the probabilities assigned by\nthe generation model reflect its preferences for the generated summary,\nincluding the preference for factual consistency, and the preference for the\nlanguage or knowledge prior as well. To separate the preference for factual\nconsistency, we propose an unsupervised framework named CoP by controlling the\npreference of the generation model with the help of prompt. More specifically,\nthe framework performs an extra inference step in which a text prompt is\nintroduced as an additional input. In this way, another preference is described\nby the generation probability of this extra inference process. The difference\nbetween the above two preferences, i.e. the difference between the\nprobabilities, could be used as measurements for detecting factual\ninconsistencies. Interestingly, we found that with the properly designed\nprompt, our framework could evaluate specific preferences and serve as\nmeasurements for fine-grained categories of inconsistency, such as\nentity-related inconsistency, coreference-related inconsistency, etc. Moreover,\nour framework could also be extended to the supervised setting to learn better\nprompt from the labeled data as well.

    "abstract": "The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, where billions of devices and\nsensors are becoming more and more connected and ubiquitous, is putting a\nstrain on traditional terrestrial networks, that may no longer be able to\nfulfill service requirements efficiently. This issue is further complicated in\nrural and remote areas with scarce and low-quality cellular coverage. To fill\nthis gap, the research community is focusing on non-terrestrial networks\n(NTNs), where Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), High Altitude Platforms (HAPs)\nand satellites can serve as aerial/space gateways to aggregate, process, and\nrelay the IoT traffic. In this paper we demonstrate this paradigm, and evaluate\nhow common Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies, designed and\ndeveloped to operate for IoT systems, work in NTNs. We then formalize an\noptimization problem to decide whether and how IoT traffic can be offloaded to\nLEO satellites to reduce the burden on terrestrial gateways.",

To mitigate this impact, we design a delay-aware\nmulti-agent communication model (DACOM) to adapt communication to delays.\nSpecifically, DACOM introduces a component, TimeNet, that is responsible for\nadjusting the waiting time of an agent to receive messages from other agents\nsuch that the uncertainty associated with delay can be addressed.

    "abstract": "In the Maximum Weight Independent Set of Rectangles problem (MWISR) we are\ngiven a weighted set of $n$ axis-parallel rectangles in the plane. The task is\nto find a subset of pairwise non-overlapping rectangles with the maximum\npossible total weight. This problem is NP-hard and the best-known\npolynomial-time approximation algorithm, due to by Chalermsook and Walczak\n(SODA 2021), achieves approximation factor $O(\\log\\log n )$. While in the\nunweighted setting, constant factor approximation algorithms are known, due to\nMitchell (FOCS 2021) and to G\\'alvez et al. (SODA 2022), it remains open to\nextend these techniques to the weighted setting.\nIn this paper, we consider MWISR through the lens of parameterized\napproximation. Grandoni et al. (ESA 2019) gave a $(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation\nalgorithm with running time $k^{O(k/\\epsilon^8)} n^{O(1/\\epsilon^8)}$ time,\nwhere $k$ is the number of rectangles in an optimum solution. Unfortunately,\ntheir algorithm works only in the unweighted setting and they left it as an\nopen problem to give a parameterized approximation scheme in the weighted\nsetting.\nOur contribution is a partial answer to the open question of Grandoni et al.\n(ESA 2019). We give a parameterized approximation algorithm for MWISR that\ngiven a parameter $k$, finds a set of non-overlapping rectangles of weight at\nleast $(1-\\epsilon) \\text{opt}_k$ in $2^{O(k \\log(k/\\epsilon))}\nn^{O(1/\\epsilon)}$ time, where $\\text{opt}_k$ is the maximum weight of a\nsolution of cardinality at most $k$. Note that thus, our algorithm may return a\nsolution consisting of more than $k$ rectangles. To complement this apparent\nweakness, we also propose a parameterized approximation scheme with running\ntime $2^{O(k^2 \\log(k/\\epsilon))} n^{O(1)}$ that finds a solution with\ncardinality at most $k$ and total weight at least $(1-\\epsilon)\\text{opt}_k$\nfor the special case of axis-parallel segments.",

    "abstract": "Zero-sum Markov Games (MGs) has been an efficient framework for multi-agent\nsystems and robust control, wherein a minimax problem is constructed to solve\nthe equilibrium policies. At present, this formulation is well studied under\ntabular settings wherein the maximum operator is primarily and exactly solved\nto calculate the worst-case value function. However, it is non-trivial to\nextend such methods to handle complex tasks, as finding the maximum over\nlarge-scale action spaces is usually cumbersome. In this paper, we propose the\nsmoothing policy iteration (SPI) algorithm to solve the zero-sum MGs\napproximately, where the maximum operator is replaced by the weighted LogSumExp\n(WLSE) function to obtain the nearly optimal equilibrium policies. Specially,\nthe adversarial policy is served as the weight function to enable an efficient\nsampling over action spaces.We also prove the convergence of SPI and analyze\nits approximation error in $\\infty -$norm based on the contraction mapping\ntheorem. Besides, we propose a model-based algorithm called Smooth adversarial\nActor-critic (SaAC) by extending SPI with the function approximations. The\ntarget value related to WLSE function is evaluated by the sampled trajectories\nand then mean square error is constructed to optimize the value function, and\nthe gradient-ascent-descent methods are adopted to optimize the protagonist and\nadversarial policies jointly. In addition, we incorporate the\nreparameterization technique in model-based gradient back-propagation to\nprevent the gradient vanishing due to sampling from the stochastic policies. We\nverify our algorithm in both tabular and function approximation settings.\nResults show that SPI can approximate the worst-case value function with a high\naccuracy and SaAC can stabilize the training process and improve the\nadversarial robustness in a large margin.",

    "abstract": "Existing convolutional neural networks (CNN) based image super-resolution\n(SR) methods have achieved impressive performance on bicubic kernel, which is\nnot valid to handle unknown degradations in real-world applications. Recent\nblind SR methods suggest to reconstruct SR images relying on blur kernel\nestimation. However, their results still remain visible artifacts and detail\ndistortion due to the estimation errors. To alleviate these problems, in this\npaper, we propose an effective and kernel-free network, namely DSSR, which\nenables recurrent detail-structure alternative optimization without blur kernel\nprior incorporation for blind SR. Specifically, in our DSSR, a detail-structure\nmodulation module (DSMM) is built to exploit the interaction and collaboration\nof image details and structures. The DSMM consists of two components: a detail\nrestoration unit (DRU) and a structure modulation unit (SMU). The former aims\nat regressing the intermediate HR detail reconstruction from LR structural\ncontexts, and the latter performs structural contexts modulation conditioned on\nthe learned detail maps at both HR and LR spaces. Besides, we use the output of\nDSMM as the hidden state and design our DSSR architecture from a recurrent\nconvolutional neural network (RCNN) view. In this way, the network can\nalternatively optimize the image details and structural contexts, achieving\nco-optimization across time. Moreover, equipped with the recurrent connection,\nour DSSR allows low- and high-level feature representations complementary by\nobserving previous HR details and contexts at every unrolling time. Extensive\nexperiments on synthetic datasets and real-world images demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves the state-of-the-art against existing methods.

Despite existing blind SR\nmethods proposed to solve this problem using blur kernel estimation, the\nperceptual quality and reconstruction accuracy are still unsatisfactory. In\nthis paper, we analyze the degradation of a high-resolution (HR) image from\nimage intrinsic components according to a degradation-based formulation model.\nWe propose a components decomposition and co-optimization network (CDCN) for\nblind SR. Firstly, CDCN decomposes the input LR image into structure and detail\ncomponents in feature space. Then, the mutual collaboration block (MCB) is\npresented to exploit the relationship between both two components. In this way,\nthe detail component can provide informative features to enrich the structural\ncontext and the structure component can carry structural context for better\ndetail revealing via a mutual complementary manner. After that, we present a\ndegradation-driven learning strategy to jointly supervise the HR image detail\nand structure restoration process. Finally, a multi-scale fusion module\nfollowed by an upsampling layer is designed to fuse the structure and detail\nfeatures and perform SR reconstruction. Empowered by such degradation-based\ncomponents decomposition, collaboration, and mutual optimization, we can bridge\nthe correlation between component learning and degradation modelling for blind\nSR, thereby producing SR results with more accurate textures.

The core\ncontribution of this paper is twofold. First, we build a comprehensive video\nrecognition benchmark of Kinetics-GVR, including four sub-task datasets to\ncover the mentioned settings. To facilitate the research of GVR, we propose to\nutilize external textual knowledge from the Internet and provide multi-source\ntext descriptions for all action classes. Second, inspired by the flexibility\nof language representation, we present a unified visual-linguistic framework\n(VLG) to solve the problem of GVR by an effective two-stage training paradigm.\nOur VLG is first pre-trained on video and language datasets to learn a shared\nfeature space, and then devises a flexible bi-modal attention head to\ncollaborate high-level semantic concepts under different settings. Extensive\nresults show that our VLG obtains the state-of-the-art performance under four\nsettings.

    "abstract": "Metrics for merge trees that are simultaneously stable, informative, and\nefficiently computable have so far eluded researchers. We show in this work\nthat it is possible to devise such a metric when restricting merge trees to\nordered domains such as the interval and the circle. We present the ``dynamic\nordered persistence editing'' (DOPE) distance, which we prove is stable and\ninformative while satisfying metric properties. We then devise a simple\n$O(N^2)$ dynamic programming algorithm to compute it on the interval and an\n$O(N^3)$ algorithm to compute it on the circle. Surprisingly, we accomplish\nthis by ignoring all of the hierarchical information of the merge tree and\nsimply focusing on a sequence of ordered critical points, which can be\ninterpreted as a time series. Thus our algorithm is more similar to string edit\ndistance and dynamic time warping than it is to more conventional merge tree\ncomparison algorithms. In the context of time series with the interval as a\ndomain, we show empirically on the UCR time series classification dataset that\nDOPE performs better than bottleneck/Wasserstein distances between persistence\ndiagrams.",

Also, TST models implicitly\nneed to preserve the content while transforming a source sentence into the\ntarget style. To tackle these problems, an intermediate representation is often\nconstructed that is devoid of style while still preserving the meaning of the\nsource sentence. In this work, we study the usefulness of Abstract Meaning\nRepresentation (AMR) graph as the intermediate style agnostic representation.\nWe posit that semantic notations like AMR are a natural choice for an\nintermediate representation.

The idea is to generate a 3D scene of Mars' surface to address\nkey challenges in planetary surface exploration such as: planetary geology,\nsimulated navigation and shape analysis. Although there exist different methods\nto enable a 3D reconstruction of Mars' surface, they rely on classical computer\ngraphics techniques that incur high amounts of computational resources during\nthe reconstruction process, and have limitations with generalizing\nreconstructions to unseen scenes and adapting to new images coming from rover\ncameras.

To speed up the learning process, we replaced the sparse set of\nrover images with their neural graphics primitives (NGPs), a set of vectors of\nfixed length that are learned to preserve the information of the original\nimages in a significantly smaller size.

Overfitted models have been shown to be\nsusceptible to query-based attacks such as membership inference attacks (MIAs).\nMIAs aim to determine whether a sample belongs to the dataset used to train a\nclassifier (members) or not (nonmembers). Recently, a new class of label based\nMIAs (LAB MIAs) was proposed, where an adversary was only required to have\nknowledge of predicted labels of samples. Developing a defense against an\nadversary carrying out a LAB MIA on DNN models that cannot be retrained remains\nan open problem.\nWe present LDL, a light weight defense against LAB MIAs. LDL works by\nconstructing a high-dimensional sphere around queried samples such that the\nmodel decision is unchanged for (noisy) variants of the sample within the\nsphere. This sphere of label-invariance creates ambiguity and prevents a\nquerying adversary from correctly determining whether a sample is a member or a\nnonmember.

In this paper, we propose a new machine learning (ML) assisted\nunrolling approach, called LAAU (Learning-Assisted Algorithm Unrolling), which\nunrolls the online decision pipeline and leverages an ML model for updating the\nLagrangian multiplier online. For efficient training via backpropagation, we\nderive gradients of the decision pipeline over time. We also provide the\naverage cost bounds for two cases when training data is available offline and\ncollected online, respectively. Finally, we present numerical results to\nhighlight that LAAU can outperform the existing baselines.",

    "abstract": "Large language models demonstrate an emergent ability to learn a new task\nfrom a small number of input-output demonstrations, referred to as in-context\nfew-shot learning. However, recent work shows that in such settings, models\nmainly learn to mimic the new task distribution, instead of the mechanics of\nthe new task. We argue that the commonly-used evaluation settings of few-shot\nmodels utilizing a random selection of in-context demonstrations is not able to\ndisentangle models' ability to learn new skills from demonstrations, as most of\nthe such-selected demonstrations are not informative for prediction beyond\nexposing the new task's input and output distribution.\nTherefore, we introduce an evaluation technique that disentangles few-shot\nlearners' gain from in-context learning by picking the demonstrations sharing a\nspecific, informative concept with the predicted sample, in addition to the\nperformance reached by mainly non-informative samples. We find that regardless\nof the model size, existing few-shot learners are not able to benefit from\nobserving such informative concepts in demonstrations. We also find that such\nability may not be obtained trivially by exposing the informative\ndemonstrations in the training process, leaving the challenge of training true\nin-context learners open.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of AI in recent years and the increase in complexity of the\nmodels, the growing demand in computational resources is starting to pose a\nsignificant challenge. The need for higher compute power is being met with\nincreasingly more potent accelerators and the use of large compute clusters.\nHowever, the gain in prediction accuracy from large models trained on\ndistributed and accelerated systems comes at the price of a substantial\nincrease in energy demand, and researchers have started questioning the\nenvironmental friendliness of such AI methods at scale. Consequently, energy\nefficiency plays an important role for AI model developers and infrastructure\noperators alike. The energy consumption of AI workloads depends on the model\nimplementation and the utilized hardware. Therefore, accurate measurements of\nthe power draw of AI workflows on different types of compute nodes is key to\nalgorithmic improvements and the design of future compute clusters and\nhardware. To this end, we present measurements of the energy consumption of two\ntypical applications of deep learning models on different types of compute\nnodes. Our results indicate that 1. deriving energy consumption directly from\nruntime is not accurate, but the consumption of the compute node needs to be\nconsidered regarding its composition; 2. neglecting accelerator hardware on\nmixed nodes results in overproportional inefficiency regarding energy\nconsumption; 3. energy consumption of model training and inference should be\nconsidered separately - while training on GPUs outperforms all other node types\nregarding both runtime and energy consumption, inference on CPU nodes can be\ncomparably efficient. One advantage of our approach is that the information on\nenergy consumption is available to all users of the supercomputer, enabling an\neasy transfer to other workloads alongside a raise in user-awareness of energy\nconsumption.",

    "abstract": "We present a robust methodology for evaluating biases in natural language\ngeneration(NLG) systems. Previous works use fixed hand-crafted prefix templates\nwith mentions of various demographic groups to prompt models to generate\ncontinuations for bias analysis. These fixed prefix templates could themselves\nbe specific in terms of styles or linguistic structures, which may lead to\nunreliable fairness conclusions that are not representative of the general\ntrends from tone varying prompts. To study this problem, we paraphrase the\nprompts with different syntactic structures and use these to evaluate\ndemographic bias in NLG systems. Our results suggest similar overall bias\ntrends but some syntactic structures lead to contradictory conclusions compared\nto past works. We show that our methodology is more robust and that some\nsyntactic structures prompt more toxic content while others could prompt less\nbiased generation. This suggests the importance of not relying on a fixed\nsyntactic structure and using tone-invariant prompts. Introducing\nsyntactically-diverse prompts can achieve more robust NLG (bias) evaluation.",

Active learning methods aim to prioritise a subset of\navailable image data for expert annotation, for label-efficient model training.\nWe develop a controller neural network that measures priority of images in a\nsequence of batches, as in batch-mode active learning, for multi-class\nsegmentation tasks. The controller is optimised by rewarding positive\ntask-specific performance gain, within a Markov decision process (MDP)\nenvironment that also optimises the task predictor.

A meta-reinforcement learning algorithm is\nproposed with multiple MDPs, such that the pre-trained controller can be\nadapted to a new MDP that contains data from different institutes and/or\nrequires segmentation of different organs or structures within the abdomen. We\npresent experimental results using multiple CT datasets from more than one\nthousand patients, with segmentation tasks of nine different abdominal organs,\nto demonstrate the efficacy of the learnt prioritisation controller function\nand its cross-institute and cross-organ adaptability. We show that the proposed\nadaptable prioritisation metric yields converging segmentation accuracy for the\nnovel class of kidney, unseen in training, using between approximately 40\\% to\n60\\% of labels otherwise required with other heuristic or random prioritisation\nmetrics. For clinical datasets of limited size, the proposed adaptable\nprioritisation offers a performance improvement of 22.6\\% and 10.2\\% in Dice\nscore, for tasks of kidney and liver vessel segmentation, respectively,\ncompared to random prioritisation and alternative active sampling strategies.",

To address this problem, we propose a framework for\nevaluating fairness in contextual resource allocation systems that is inspired\nby fairness metrics in machine learning.

But they in turn bring in\nTHz narrow beam alignment challenges in mobile networks, resulting in poor link\nconnection and severe latency that degrades the network performance. This paper\nexploits integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology to reduce the\nTHz beam misalignment caused by LoS blockage and user mobility. In line with\nthe 5G-specified beam management, we propose a joint reference signal (RS) and\nthe synchronization signal block (SSB)-based sensing scheme to predict the need\nfor beam switches, and signalling in advance to prevent beam misalignment,\nnamed the joint SSB and RS-based sensing (JSRS) scheme. By reducing the impact\nof imperfect sensing, we further provide a time-frequency sensing resource\nallocation scheme that minimizes the beam misalignment probability. Considering\nthe sensing trade-offs and THz features, we provide stochastic geometry-based\nexpressions for coverage probability and network throughput, revealing design\ninsights into ISAC-THz network deployment and resource allocation. In urban use\ncases tested, numerical results show that the JSRS scheme averagely reduces 80%\nprobability of beam misalignment, and enhances the coverage probability by\nabout 75%, compared to the network with 5G-required positioning ability.\nDespite the imperfect sensing accuracy, JSRS scheme can achieve comparable\nperformance to that of the ideal-sensing case. By exploiting the angular\nperception ability of directional beams, JSRS scheme helps mitigate the\nchallenge of narrow beam management to enhance the network coverage and\nthroughput, showing the great potential of ISAC-aided THz communication.",

In this context, this paper provides a massive\ngrant-free random access (GF-RA) scheme for LEO satellite IoT.

By exploiting the characteristics of the tensor\nstructure, a Bayesian learning algorithm for joint active device detection and\nchannel estimation during massive GF-RA is designed. Theoretical analysis shows\nthat the proposed algorithm has fast convergence and low complexity. Finally,\nextensive simulation results confirm its better performance in terms of error\nprobability for active device detection and normalized mean square error for\nchannel estimation over baseline algorithms in LEO satellite IoT.

    "abstract": "The problem of designing downlink transmission schemes for supporting\nheterogeneous ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and/or with\nother types of services is investigated. We consider the broadcast channel,\nwhere the base station sends superimposed signals to multiple users. Under\nheterogeneous blocklength constraints, strong users who are URLLC users cannot\nwait to receive the entire transmission frame and perform successive\ninterference cancellation (SIC) due to stringent latency requirements, in\ncontrast to the conventional infinite blocklength cases. Even if SIC is\nfeasible, SIC may be imperfect under finite blocklength constraints. To cope\nwith the heterogeneity in latency and reliability requirements, we propose a\npractical downlink transmission scheme with discrete signaling and single-user\ndecoding (SUD), i.e., without SIC. We carefully design the discrete input\ndistributions to enable efficient SUD by exploiting the structural\ninterference. Furthermore, we derive the second-order achievable rate under\nheterogenous blocklength and error probability constraints and use it to guide\nthe design of channel coding and modulations. It is shown that in terms of\nachievable rate under short blocklength, the proposed scheme with regular\nquadrature amplitude modulations and SUD can operate extremely close to the\nbenchmark schemes that assume perfect SIC with Gaussian signaling.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been ubiquitously adopted in internet of\nthings and are becoming an integral of our daily life. When tackling the\nevolving learning tasks in real world, such as classifying different types of\nobjects, DNNs face the challenge to continually retrain themselves according to\nthe tasks on different edge devices. Federated continual learning is a\npromising technique that offers partial solutions but yet to overcome the\nfollowing difficulties: the significant accuracy loss due to the limited\non-device processing, the negative knowledge transfer caused by the limited\ncommunication of non-IID data, and the limited scalability on the tasks and\nedge devices. In this paper, we propose FedKNOW, an accurate and scalable\nfederated continual learning framework, via a novel concept of signature task\nknowledge. FedKNOW is a client side solution that continuously extracts and\nintegrates the knowledge of signature tasks which are highly influenced by the\ncurrent task. Each client of FedKNOW is composed of a knowledge extractor, a\ngradient restorer and, most importantly, a gradient integrator. Upon training\nfor a new task, the gradient integrator ensures the prevention of catastrophic\nforgetting and mitigation of negative knowledge transfer by effectively\ncombining signature tasks identified from the past local tasks and other\nclients' current tasks through the global model. We implement FedKNOW in\nPyTorch and extensively evaluate it against state-of-the-art techniques using\npopular federated continual learning benchmarks. Extensive evaluation results\non heterogeneous edge devices show that FedKNOW improves model accuracy by\n63.24% without increasing model training time, reduces communication cost by\n34.28%, and achieves more improvements under difficult scenarios such as large\nnumbers of tasks or clients, and training different complex networks.",

However,\ncollecting knowledge-grounded conversations is often costly, calling for a\nbetter pre-trained model for grounded dialog generation that generalizes well\nw.r.t. different types of knowledge. In this work, we propose KPT\n(Keyword-guided Pre-Training), a novel self-supervised pre-training method for\ngrounded dialog generation without relying on extra knowledge annotation.\nSpecifically, we use a pre-trained language model to extract the most uncertain\ntokens in the dialog as keywords. With these keywords, we construct two kinds\nof knowledge and pre-train a knowledge-grounded response generation model,\naiming at handling two different scenarios: (1) the knowledge should be\nfaithfully grounded; (2) it can be selectively used. For the former, the\ngrounding knowledge consists of keywords extracted from the response. For the\nlatter, the grounding knowledge is additionally augmented with keywords\nextracted from other utterances in the same dialog. Since the knowledge is\nextracted from the dialog itself, KPT can be easily performed on a large volume\nand variety of dialogue data. We considered three data sources (open-domain,\ntask-oriented, conversational QA) with a total of 2.5M dialogues. We conduct\nextensive experiments on various few-shot knowledge-grounded generation tasks,\nincluding grounding on dialog acts, knowledge graphs, persona descriptions, and\nWikipedia passages.

As for the lightweight design, the data\nprocessing is simplified to minimum, and MobileNetV2 is selected as our\nbackbone. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, where\nour approach achieves promising results and succeeds in striking a balance\nbetween performance and efficiency.

This perspective naturally relates deep learning with\nthe pursuit of constructing channels with optimal performance in information\ntransmission and representation. While considerable efforts are concentrated on\nrealizing optimal channel properties during network optimization, we study a\nfrequently overlooked possibility that neural networks can be initialized\ntoward optimal channels.

To fill this gap, we develop a corrected mean-field framework\napplicable for characterizing the limiting behaviors of information propagation\nin neural networks without strong assumptions on inputs. Based on it, we\npropose an analytic theory to prove that mutual information maximization is\nrealized between inputs and propagated signals when neural networks are\ninitialized at dynamic isometry, a case where information transmits via\nnorm-preserving mappings.

    "abstract": "Multi-lingual language models (LM), such as mBERT, XLM-R, mT5, mBART, have\nbeen remarkably successful in enabling natural language tasks in low-resource\nlanguages through cross-lingual transfer from high-resource ones. In this work,\nwe try to better understand how such models, specifically mT5, transfer *any*\nlinguistic and semantic knowledge across languages, even though no explicit\ncross-lingual signals are provided during pre-training. Rather, only\nunannotated texts from each language are presented to the model separately and\nindependently of one another, and the model appears to implicitly learn\ncross-lingual connections. This raises several questions that motivate our\nstudy, such as: Are the cross-lingual connections between every language pair\nequally strong? What properties of source and target language impact the\nstrength of cross-lingual transfer? Can we quantify the impact of those\nproperties on the cross-lingual transfer?\nIn our investigation, we analyze a pre-trained mT5 to discover the attributes\nof cross-lingual connections learned by the model. Through a statistical\ninterpretation framework over 90 language pairs across three tasks, we show\nthat transfer performance can be modeled by a few linguistic and data-derived\nfeatures. These observations enable us to interpret cross-lingual understanding\nof the mT5 model. Through these observations, one can favorably choose the best\nsource language for a task, and can anticipate its training data demands. A key\nfinding of this work is that similarity of syntax, morphology and phonology are\ngood predictors of cross-lingual transfer, significantly more than just the\nlexical similarity of languages. For a given language, we are able to predict\nzero-shot performance, that increases on a logarithmic scale with the number of\nfew-shot target language data points.",

We show that our procedure better predicts mistakes,\noutperforming the popular max logit baseline on selective prediction tasks.\nNext, we propose a simple and efficient way to improve accuracy on such\nuncertain images by making use of the WordNet hierarchy; specifically we\naugment the original class by incorporating its parent and children from the\nsemantic label hierarchy, and plug the augmentation into text promts. We\nconduct experiments on both CLIP and LiT models with five different\nImageNet-based datasets. For CLIP, our method improves the top-1 accuracy by\n17.13% on the uncertain subset and 3.6% on the entire ImageNet validation set.\nWe also show that our method improves across ImageNet shifted datasets and\nother model architectures such as LiT. Our proposed method is\nhyperparameter-free, requires no additional model training and can be easily\nscaled to other large multi-modal architectures.",

    "abstract": "Both goal-agnostic and goal-oriented tasks have practical value for robotic\ngrasping: goal-agnostic tasks target all objects in the workspace, while\ngoal-oriented tasks aim at grasping pre-assigned goal objects. However, most\ncurrent grasping methods are only better at coping with one task. In this work,\nwe propose a bifunctional push-grasping synergistic strategy for goal-agnostic\nand goal-oriented grasping tasks. Our method integrates pushing along with\ngrasping to pick up all objects or pre-assigned goal objects with high action\nefficiency depending on the task requirement. We introduce a bifunctional\nnetwork, which takes in visual observations and outputs dense pixel-wise maps\nof Q values for pushing and grasping primitive actions, to increase the\navailable samples in the action space. Then we propose a hierarchical\nreinforcement learning framework to coordinate the two tasks by considering the\ngoal-agnostic task as a combination of multiple goal-oriented tasks. To reduce\nthe training difficulty of the hierarchical framework, we design a two-stage\ntraining method to train the two types of tasks separately. We perform\npre-training of the model in simulation, and then transfer the learned model to\nthe real world without any additional real-world fine-tuning. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in task\ncompletion rate and grasp success rate with less motion number.

    "abstract": "Fully supervised salient object detection (SOD) has made considerable\nprogress based on expensive and time-consuming data with pixel-wise\nannotations. Recently, to relieve the labeling burden while maintaining\nperformance, some scribble-based SOD methods have been proposed. However,\nlearning precise boundary details from scribble annotations that lack edge\ninformation is still difficult. In this paper, we propose to learn precise\nboundaries from our designed synthetic images and labels without introducing\nany extra auxiliary data. The synthetic image creates boundary information by\ninserting synthetic concave regions that simulate the real concave regions of\nsalient objects. Furthermore, we propose a novel self-consistent framework that\nconsists of a global integral branch (GIB) and a boundary-aware branch (BAB) to\ntrain a saliency detector. GIB aims to identify integral salient objects, whose\ninput is the original image. BAB aims to help predict accurate boundaries,\nwhose input is the synthetic image. These two branches are connected through a\nself-consistent loss to guide the saliency detector to predict precise\nboundaries while identifying salient objects. Experimental results on five\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly\nsupervised SOD methods and further narrows the gap with the fully supervised\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "The success of deep learning is partly attributed to the availability of\nmassive data downloaded freely from the Internet. However, it also means that\nusers' private data may be collected by commercial organizations without\nconsent and used to train their models. Therefore, it's important and necessary\nto develop a method or tool to prevent unauthorized data exploitation. In this\npaper, we propose ConfounderGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) that\ncan make personal image data unlearnable to protect the data privacy of its\nowners. Specifically, the noise produced by the generator for each image has\nthe confounder property. It can build spurious correlations between images and\nlabels, so that the model cannot learn the correct mapping from images to\nlabels in this noise-added dataset. Meanwhile, the discriminator is used to\nensure that the generated noise is small and imperceptible, thereby remaining\nthe normal utility of the encrypted image for humans. The experiments are\nconducted in six image classification datasets, consisting of three natural\nobject datasets and three medical datasets. The results demonstrate that our\nmethod not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in standard settings, but\ncan also be applied to fast encryption scenarios.

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation has been actively studied in fields such as robot\nvision, autonomous driving, and 3D scene understanding. Given a sequence of\ncolor images, unsupervised learning methods based on the framework of\nStructure-From-Motion (SfM) simultaneously predict depth and camera relative\npose. However, dynamically moving objects in the scene violate the static world\nassumption, resulting in inaccurate depths of dynamic objects. In this work, we\npropose a new method to address such dynamic object movements through monocular\n3D object detection. Specifically, we first detect 3D objects in the images and\nbuild the per-pixel correspondence of the dynamic pixels with the detected\nobject pose while leaving the static pixels corresponding to the rigid\nbackground to be modeled with camera motion. In this way, the depth of every\npixel can be learned via a meaningful geometry model. Besides, objects are\ndetected as cuboids with absolute scale, which is used to eliminate the scale\nambiguity problem inherent in monocular vision. Experiments on the KITTI depth\ndataset show that our method achieves State-of-The-Art performance for depth\nestimation. Furthermore, joint training of depth, camera motion and object pose\nalso improves monocular 3D object detection performance. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work that allows a monocular 3D object detection\nnetwork to be fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner.",

    "abstract": "Referring image segmentation aims at localizing all pixels of the visual\nobjects described by a natural language sentence. Previous works learn to\nstraightforwardly align the sentence embedding and pixel-level embedding for\nhighlighting the referred objects, but ignore the semantic consistency of\npixels within the same object, leading to incomplete masks and localization\nerrors in predictions. To tackle this problem, we propose CoupAlign, a simple\nyet effective multi-level visual-semantic alignment method, to couple\nsentence-mask alignment with word-pixel alignment to enforce object mask\nconstraint for achieving more accurate localization and segmentation.\nSpecifically, the Word-Pixel Alignment (WPA) module performs early fusion of\nlinguistic and pixel-level features in intermediate layers of the vision and\nlanguage encoders. Based on the word-pixel aligned embedding, a set of mask\nproposals are generated to hypothesize possible objects. Then in the\nSentence-Mask Alignment (SMA) module, the masks are weighted by the sentence\nembedding to localize the referred object, and finally projected back to\naggregate the pixels for the target. To further enhance the learning of the two\nalignment modules, an auxiliary loss is designed to contrast the foreground and\nbackground pixels. By hierarchically aligning pixels and masks with linguistic\nfeatures, our CoupAlign captures the pixel coherence at both visual and\nsemantic levels, thus generating more accurate predictions. Extensive\nexperiments on popular datasets (e.g., RefCOCO and G-Ref) show that our method\nachieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, e.g., about 2%\noIoU increase on the validation and testing set of RefCOCO. Especially,\nCoupAlign has remarkable ability in distinguishing the target from multiple\nobjects of the same class.",

This\npaper investigates optimal power scheduling for a power-transportation coupled\nnetwork in the day-ahead energy market considering multiple uncertainties\nrelated to photovoltaic (PV) generation and the traffic demand of vehicles. The\ncrux of this problem is to model the coupling relation between the two networks\nin the day-ahead scheduling stage and consider the intra-day spatial\nuncertainties of the source and load.

In order to ensure the individual optimality of the two networks\nin a unified framework in day-ahead power scheduling, a two-stage\ndistributionally robust centralized optimization model is established to carry\nout the equilibrium of power-transportation coupled network.

Pavement images are often in high-resolution with a low\nratio of distressed to non-distressed areas. Advanced approaches leverage these\nproperties via dividing images into patches and explore discriminative features\nin the scale space. However, these approaches usually suffer from information\nloss during image resizing and low efficiency due to complex learning\nframeworks. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient method for PDR. A\nlight network named the Kernel Inversed Pyramidal Resizing Network (KIPRN) is\nintroduced for image resizing, and can be flexibly plugged into the image\nclassification network as a pre-network to exploit resolution and scale\ninformation. In KIPRN, pyramidal convolution and kernel inversed convolution\nare specifically designed to mine discriminative information across different\nfeature granularities and scales. The mined information is passed along to the\nresized images to yield an informative image pyramid to assist the image\nclassification network for PDR. We applied our method to three well-known\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and conducted an evaluation on a\nlarge-scale pavement image dataset named CQU-BPDD.

Compared with the flat\nEuclidean space, the curved hyperbolic space is far more ambient and\nembeddable, particularly for datasets with implicit tree-like architectures,\nsuch as hierarchies and power-law distributions. On the other hand, the\nstructure of a real-world network is usually intricate, with some regions being\ntree-like, some being flat, and others being circular. Directly embedding\nheterogeneous structural networks into a homogeneous embedding space\nunavoidably brings inductive biases and distortions. Inspiringly, the discrete\ncurvature can well describe the local structure of a node and its surroundings,\nwhich motivates us to investigate the information conveyed by the network\ntopology explicitly in improving geometric learning. To this end, we explore\nthe properties of the local discrete curvature of graph topology and the\ncontinuous global curvature of embedding space. Besides, a Hyperbolic\nCurvature-aware Graph Neural Network, HCGNN, is further proposed. In\nparticular, HCGNN utilizes the discrete curvature to lead message passing of\nthe surroundings and adaptively adjust the continuous curvature simultaneously.\nExtensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks show\nthat the proposed method outperforms various competitive models by a large\nmargin in both high and low hyperbolic graph data. Case studies further\nillustrate the efficacy of discrete curvature in finding local clusters and\nalleviating the distortion caused by hyperbolic geometry.",

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable progress of image captioning, existing captioners\ntypically lack the controllable capability to generate desired image captions,\ne.g., describing the image in a rough or detailed manner, in a factual or\nemotional view, etc. In this paper, we show that a unified model is qualified\nto perform well in diverse domains and freely switch among multiple styles.\nSuch a controllable capability is achieved by embedding the prompt learning\ninto the image captioning framework. To be specific, we design a set of prompts\nto fine-tune the pre-trained image captioner. These prompts allow the model to\nabsorb stylized data from different domains for joint training, without\nperformance degradation in each domain. Furthermore, we optimize the prompts\nwith learnable vectors in the continuous word embedding space, avoiding the\nheuristic prompt engineering and meanwhile exhibiting superior performance. In\nthe inference stage, our model is able to generate desired stylized captions by\nchoosing the corresponding prompts. Extensive experiments verify the\ncontrollable capability of the proposed method. Notably, we achieve outstanding\nperformance on two diverse image captioning benchmarks including COCO Karpathy\nsplit and TextCaps using a unified model.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks can easily fool object recognition systems based on deep\nneural networks (DNNs). Although many defense methods have been proposed in\nrecent years, most of them can still be adaptively evaded. One reason for the\nweak adversarial robustness may be that DNNs are only supervised by category\nlabels and do not have part-based inductive bias like the recognition process\nof humans. Inspired by a well-known theory in cognitive psychology --\nrecognition-by-components, we propose a novel object recognition model ROCK\n(Recognizing Object by Components with human prior Knowledge). It first\nsegments parts of objects from images, then scores part segmentation results\nwith predefined human prior knowledge, and finally outputs prediction based on\nthe scores. The first stage of ROCK corresponds to the process of decomposing\nobjects into parts in human vision. The second stage corresponds to the\ndecision process of the human brain. ROCK shows better robustness than\nclassical recognition models across various attack settings. These results\nencourage researchers to rethink the rationality of currently widely-used\nDNN-based object recognition models and explore the potential of part-based\nmodels, once important but recently ignored, for improving robustness.",

The increasing shortage of kidney donors has driven the\ndevelopment of desensitization techniques to overcome this immunological\nchallenge. Compared with compatible KT, patients undergoing incompatible KTs\nare more likely to experience rejection, infection, malignancy, and graft loss.\nWe study the optimal acceptance of possibly incompatible kidneys for individual\nend-stage kidney disease patients. To capture the effect of incompatibility, we\npropose a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that explicitly includes\ncompatibility as a state variable. The resulting higher-dimensional model makes\nit more challenging to analyze, but under suitable conditions, we derive\nstructural properties including control limit-type optimal policies that are\neasy to compute and implement.

    "abstract": "Large pretrained language models can easily produce toxic or biased content,\nwhich is prohibitive for practical use. In order to detect such toxic\ngenerations, existing methods rely on templates, real-world data extraction,\ncrowdsourcing workers, or automatic generation to construct adversarial\ncontexts that are likely to induce toxic generations. However, what type of\ncontext is more likely to induce unsafe responses is still under-explored. In\nthis paper, we identify that context toxicity and context category (e.g.,\n\\textit{profanity}, \\textit{insult}, \\textit{drugs}, etc.) are two important\nfactors to cause safety issues in response generation. Hence, we propose a\nmethod called \\emph{reverse generation} to construct adversarial contexts\nconditioned on a given response, with the flexibility to control category,\ntoxicity level, and inductivity of the generated contexts. Via reverse\ngeneration, we augment the existing BAD dataset and construct a new dataset\nBAD+ which contains more than 120K diverse and highly inductive contexts in 12\ncategories. We test three popular pretrained dialogue models (Blender,\nDialoGPT, and Plato2) and find that BAD+ can largely expose their safety\nproblems. Furthermore, we show that BAD+ can greatly enhance the safety of\ngeneration and reveal the key factors of safety improvement.

A folklore algorithm provides\na $2$-approximate solution in polynomial time for all $k=O(1)$, and works\nirrespective of the underlying distance measure, so long it is a metric;\nhowever, going below the $2$-factor is a notorious challenge. We consider the\nUlam distance, a variant of the well-known edit-distance metric, where strings\nare restricted to be permutations. For this metric, Chakraborty, Das, and\nKrauthgamer [SODA, 2021] provided a $(2-\\delta)$-approximation algorithm for\n$k=1$, where $\\delta\\approx 2^{-40}$.\nOur primary contribution is a new algorithmic framework for clustering a set\nof permutations. Our first result is a $1.999$-approximation algorithm for the\nmetric $k$-median problem under the Ulam metric, that runs in time $(k \\log\n(nd))^{O(k)}n d^3$ for an input consisting of $n$ permutations over $[d]$. In\nfact, our framework is powerful enough to extend this result to the streaming\nmodel (where the $n$ input permutations arrive one by one) using only\npolylogarithmic (in $n$) space. Additionally, we show that similar results can\nbe obtained even in the presence of outliers, which is presumably a more\ndifficult problem.",

    "abstract": "Camera relocalization involving a prior 3D reconstruction plays a crucial\nrole in many mixed reality and robotics applications. Estimating the camera\npose directly with respect to pre-built 3D models can be prohibitively\nexpensive for several applications with limited storage and/or communication\nbandwidth. Although recent scene and absolute pose regression methods have\nbecome popular for efficient camera localization, most of them are\ncomputation-resource intensive and difficult to obtain a real-time inference\nwith high accuracy constraints. This study proposes a simple scene regression\nmethod that requires only a multi-layer perceptron network for mapping scene\ncoordinates to achieve accurate camera pose estimations. The proposed approach\nuses sparse descriptors to regress the scene coordinates, instead of a dense\nRGB image. The use of sparse features provides several advantages. First, the\nproposed regressor network is substantially smaller than those reported in\nprevious studies. This makes our system highly efficient and scalable. Second,\nthe pre-built 3D models provide the most reliable and robust 2D-3D matches.\nTherefore, learning from them can lead to an awareness of equivalent features\nand substantially improve the generalization performance.

    "abstract": "Safety is still one of the major research challenges in reinforcement\nlearning (RL). In this paper, we address the problem of how to avoid safety\nviolations of RL agents during exploration in probabilistic and partially\nunknown environments. Our approach combines automata learning for Markov\nDecision Processes (MDPs) and shield synthesis in an iterative approach.\nInitially, the MDP representing the environment is unknown. The agent starts\nexploring the environment and collects traces. From the collected traces, we\npassively learn MDPs that abstractly represent the safety-relevant aspects of\nthe environment. Given a learned MDP and a safety specification, we construct a\nshield. For each state-action pair within a learned MDP, the shield computes\nexact probabilities on how likely it is that executing the action results in\nviolating the specification from the current state within the next $k$ steps.\nAfter the shield is constructed, the shield is used during runtime and blocks\nany actions that induce a too large risk from the agent. The shielded agent\ncontinues to explore the environment and collects new data on the environment.\nIteratively, we use the collected data to learn new MDPs with higher accuracy,\nresulting in turn in shields able to prevent more safety violations. We\nimplemented our approach and present a detailed case study of a Q-learning\nagent exploring slippery Gridworlds. In our experiments, we show that as the\nagent explores more and more of the environment during training, the improved\nlearned models lead to shields that are able to prevent many safety violations.",

However, modelling and understanding the generative process of\ngraphs is challenging due to the discrete and high-dimensional nature of\ngraphs, as well as permutation invariance to node orderings in underlying graph\ndistributions. Current leading autoregressive models fail to capture the\npermutation invariance nature of graphs for the reliance on generation ordering\nand have high time complexity. Here, we propose a continuous-time generative\ndiffusion process for permutation invariant graph generation to mitigate these\nissues. Specifically, we first construct a forward diffusion process defined by\na stochastic differential equation (SDE), which smoothly converts graphs within\nthe complex distribution to random graphs that follow a known edge probability.\nSolving the corresponding reverse-time SDE, graphs can be generated from newly\nsampled random graphs. To facilitate the reverse-time SDE, we newly design a\nposition-enhanced graph score network, capturing the evolving structure and\nposition information from perturbed graphs for permutation equivariant score\nestimation. Under the evaluation of comprehensive metrics, our proposed\ngenerative diffusion process achieves competitive performance in graph\ndistribution learning.

We estimated the security and assessed families of the\npairing-friendly curve to discover families of curves better than BN, KSS, and\nBLS in terms of the required key size. We also evaluated the complexity of the\noptimal ate pairing that has never been discussed before, except by Barbulescu\net al. [2]. We demonstrated that the recent attack (TNFS) on pairing needs to\nincrease the key size. We compared families of curves in the context of key\nsize and selected a suitable alternative to an elliptic curve.",

    "abstract": "Besides the recent impressive results on reinforcement learning (RL), safety\nis still one of the major research challenges in RL. RL is a machine-learning\napproach to determine near-optimal policies in Markov decision processes\n(MDPs). In this paper, we consider the setting where the safety-relevant\nfragment of the MDP together with a temporal logic safety specification is\ngiven and many safety violations can be avoided by planning ahead a short time\ninto the future. We propose an approach for online safety shielding of RL\nagents. During runtime, the shield analyses the safety of each available\naction. For any action, the shield computes the maximal probability to not\nviolate the safety specification within the next $k$ steps when executing this\naction. Based on this probability and a given threshold, the shield decides\nwhether to block an action from the agent. Existing offline shielding\napproaches compute exhaustively the safety of all state-action combinations\nahead of time, resulting in huge computation times and large memory\nconsumption. The intuition behind online shielding is to compute at runtime the\nset of all states that could be reached in the near future. For each of these\nstates, the safety of all available actions is analysed and used for shielding\nas soon as one of the considered states is reached. Our approach is well suited\nfor high-level planning problems where the time between decisions can be used\nfor safety computations and it is sustainable for the agent to wait until these\ncomputations are finished. For our evaluation, we selected a 2-player version\nof the classical computer game SNAKE. The game represents a high-level planning\nproblem that requires fast decisions and the multiplayer setting induces a\nlarge state space, which is computationally expensive to analyse exhaustively.",

In this work, we propose a\nphysics-informed data-driven deep learning model as an efficient surrogate to\nemulate the effective responses of heterogeneous microstructures under\nirreversible elasto-plastic hardening and softening deformation. Our\ncontribution contains several major innovations.

Second, we develop a new sequential learner that\nincorporates thermodynamics consistent physics constraints by customizing\ntraining loss function and data flow architecture. We additionally demonstrate\nthe integration of trained surrogate within the framework of classic multiscale\nfinite element solver. Our numerical experiments indicate that our model shows\na significant accuracy improvement over pure data-driven emulator and a\ndramatic efficiency boost than reduced models.

    "abstract": "Despite the central role that melody plays in music perception, it remains an\nopen challenge in music information retrieval to reliably detect the notes of\nthe melody present in an arbitrary music recording. A key challenge in melody\ntranscription is building methods which can handle broad audio containing any\nnumber of instrument ensembles and musical styles - existing strategies work\nwell for some melody instruments or styles but not all. To confront this\nchallenge, we leverage representations from Jukebox (Dhariwal et al. 2020), a\ngenerative model of broad music audio, thereby improving performance on melody\ntranscription by $20$% relative to conventional spectrogram features. Another\nobstacle in melody transcription is a lack of training data - we derive a new\ndataset containing $50$ hours of melody transcriptions from crowdsourced\nannotations of broad music. The combination of generative pre-training and a\nnew dataset for this task results in $77$% stronger performance on melody\ntranscription relative to the strongest available baseline. By pairing our new\nmelody transcription approach with solutions for beat detection, key\nestimation, and chord recognition, we build Sheet Sage, a system capable of\ntranscribing human-readable lead sheets directly from music audio.\nAudio examples can be found at https://chrisdonahue.com/sheetsage and code at\nhttps://github.com/chrisdonahue/sheetsage .",

    "abstract": "Collecting large-scale medical datasets with fully annotated samples for\ntraining of deep networks is prohibitively expensive, especially for 3D volume\ndata. Recent breakthroughs in self-supervised learning (SSL) offer the ability\nto overcome the lack of labeled training samples by learning feature\nrepresentations from unlabeled data. However, most current SSL techniques in\nthe medical field have been designed for either 2D images or 3D volumes. In\npractice, this restricts the capability to fully leverage unlabeled data from\nnumerous sources, which may include both 2D and 3D data. Additionally, the use\nof these pre-trained networks is constrained to downstream tasks with\ncompatible data dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for\nunsupervised joint learning on 2D and 3D data modalities. Given a set of 2D\nimages or 2D slices extracted from 3D volumes, we construct an SSL task based\non a 2D contrastive clustering problem for distinct classes. The 3D volumes are\nexploited by computing vectored embedding at each slice and then assembling a\nholistic feature through deformable self-attention mechanisms in Transformer,\nallowing incorporating long-range dependencies between slices inside 3D\nvolumes. These holistic features are further utilized to define a novel 3D\nclustering agreement-based SSL task and masking embedding prediction inspired\nby pre-trained language models. Experiments on downstream tasks, such as 3D\nbrain segmentation, lung nodule detection, 3D heart structures segmentation,\nand abnormal chest X-ray detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of our joint\n2D and 3D SSL approach. We improve plain 2D Deep-ClusterV2 and SwAV by a\nsignificant margin and also surpass various modern 2D and 3D SSL approaches.",

    "abstract": "This work proposes an energy-efficient resource provisioning and allocation\nframework to meet the dynamic demands of future applications. The frequent\nvariations in a cloud user's resource demand lead 'to the problem of excess\npower consumption, resource wastage, performance, and Quality-of-Service\ndegradation. The proposed framework addresses these challenges by matching the\napplication's predicted resource requirement with the resource capacity of VMs\nprecisely and thereby consolidating the entire load on the minimum number of\nenergy-efficient physical machines. The three consecutive contributions of the\nproposed work are: Online Multi-Resource Feed-forward Neural Network to\nforecast the multiple resource demands concurrently for future applications;\nautoscaling of VMs based on the clustering of the predicted resource\nrequirements; allocation of the scaled VMs on the energy-efficient PMs. The\nintegrated approach successively optimizes resource utilization, saves energy\nand automatically adapts to the changes in future application resource demand.\nThe proposed framework is evaluated by using real workload traces of the\nbenchmark Google Cluster Dataset and compared against different scenarios\nincluding energy-efficient VM placement with resource prediction only, VMP\nwithout resource prediction and autoscaling, and optimal VMP with autoscaling\nbased on actual resource utilization. The observed results demonstrate that the\nproposed integrated approach achieves near-optimal performance against optimal\nVMP and outperforms rest of the VMPs in terms of power saving and resource\nutilization up to 88.5% and 21.12% respectively. In addition, the OM-FNN\npredictor shows better accuracy, lesser time and space complexity over a\ntraditional single-input and single-output feed-forward neural network\npredictor.",

Their prevalence combined with their intrusion into core private\nspheres of life has motivated research on security and privacy intrusions,\nespecially those performed by third-party applications used on such devices. In\nthis work, we take a closer look at such third-party applications from a less\npessimistic angle: we consider their potential to provide personalized and\nsecure capabilities and investigate measures to authenticate users (``PIN'',\n``Voice authentication'', ``Notification'', and presence of ``Nearby\ndevices''). To this end, we asked 100 participants to evaluate 15 application\ncategories and 51 apps with a wide range of functions. The central questions we\nexplored focused on: users' preferences for security and personalization for\ndifferent categories of apps; the preferred security and personalization\nmeasures for different apps; and the preferred frequency of the respective\nmeasure.\nAfter an initial pilot study, we focused primarily on 7 categories of apps\nfor which security and personalization are reported to be important; those\ninclude the three crucial categories finance, bills, and shopping. We found\nthat ``Voice authentication'', while not currently employed by the apps we\nstudied, is a highly popular measure to achieve security and personalization.\nMany participants were open to exploring combinations of security measures to\nincrease the protection of highly relevant apps.

This paper proposes a convex optimization model of an\nenergy management system with operational and power quality constraints and\ninteractions in a Local Energy Market (LEM) for unbalanced microgrids (MGs).\nThe LEM consists of a pre-dispatch step and an energy transactions step (ETS).\nThe ETS combines the MGs' objectives while considering two strategies: minimize\nthe cost of buyers or maximize the revenue of sellers. Our proposed model\nconsiders harmonic distortion and voltage limit power quality constraints in\nboth steps. Moreover, we model operational constraints such as power flow,\npower balance, and distributed energy resources behaviors and capacities. We\nnumerically evaluate the proposed model using three unbalanced MGs with\nresidential, industrial, and commercial load profiles, where each microgrid\nmanages its resources locally. Furthermore, we create two groups of cases to\nanalyze the interactions in the local energy market. In the first group, the\nprice of the DSO energy and the surplus from MGs to DSO are the same. The\nnumerical results show that using the increasing revenue strategy promotes MGs\nto interact more while encouraging them to have high energy prices. When the\nreducing cost strategy is used, fewer energy interactions occur, and the price\nof MGs energy is encouraged to be lower.",

However, these knowledge bases are highly\nincomplete, for example, over 70% of people in Freebase have no known place of\nbirth. To solve this problem, we propose a query-driven knowledge base\ncompletion system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured\ninformation. To effectively fuse unstructured information from the Web and\nstructured information in knowledge bases to achieve good performance, our\nsystem builds multimodal knowledge graphs based on question answering and rule\ninference. We propose a multimodal path fusion algorithm to rank candidate\nanswers based on different paths in the multimodal knowledge graphs, achieving\nmuch better performance than question answering, rule inference and a baseline\nfusion algorithm. To improve system efficiency, query-driven techniques are\nutilized to reduce the runtime of our system, providing fast responses to user\nqueries. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our system.",

    "abstract": "Related works used indexes like CKA and variants of CCA to measure the\nsimilarity of cross-lingual representations in multilingual language models. In\nthis paper, we argue that assumptions of CKA/CCA align poorly with one of the\nmotivating goals of cross-lingual learning analysis, i.e., explaining zero-shot\ncross-lingual transfer. We highlight what valuable aspects of cross-lingual\nsimilarity these indexes fail to capture and provide a motivating case study\n\\textit{demonstrating the problem empirically}. Then, we introduce\n\\textit{Average Neuron-Wise Correlation (ANC)} as a straightforward alternative\nthat is exempt from the difficulties of CKA/CCA and is good specifically in a\ncross-lingual context. Finally, we use ANC to construct evidence that the\npreviously introduced ``first align, then predict'' pattern takes place not\nonly in masked language models (MLMs) but also in multilingual models with\n\\textit{causal language modeling} objectives (CLMs). Moreover, we show that the\npattern extends to the \\textit{scaled versions} of the MLMs and CLMs (up to 85x\noriginal mBERT).\\footnote{Our code is publicly available at\n\\url{https://github.com/TartuNLP/xsim}}",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are used for a wide range of regression problems.\nHowever, there exists a significant gap in accuracy between specialized\napproaches and generic direct regression in which a network is trained by\nminimizing the squared or absolute error of output labels. Prior work has shown\nthat solving a regression problem with a set of binary classifiers can improve\naccuracy by utilizing well-studied binary classification algorithms. We\nintroduce binary-encoded labels (BEL), which generalizes the application of\nbinary classification to regression by providing a framework for considering\narbitrary multi-bit values when encoding target values.

    "abstract": "In this article, we propose a space spreading-assisted framework that\nleverages either time or frequency diversity or both to reduce interference and\nsignal loss owing to channel impairments and facilitate the efficient operation\nof large-scale dense Internet-of-Things (IoT). Our approach employs dispersion\nof data-streams transmitted from individual IoT devices over indexed space-time\n(ST), space-frequency (SF) or space-time-frequency (STF) blocks. As a result,\nno two devices transmit on the same block; only one is activated while the rest\nof the devices in the network is silent, thereby minimizing possibility of\ninterference on the transmit side. On the receive side, multiple-antenna array\nameliorates performance in presence of channel impairments while exploiting\narray-processing gain. As interference due to superposition of multiple\ndata-streams is killed at its root, no extra energy is wasted in fighting\ninterference and other impairments, thereby enabling energy-efficient\ntransmission from multiple devices over multiple access channel (MAC). To\nvalidate the proposed concept, we simulate the performance of the framework\nagainst dense IoT networks deployed in generalized indoor and outdoor scenarios\nin terms of probability of signal outage. Results demonstrate that our\nconceptualized framework benefits from interference-free transmission as well\nas enhancement in overall system performance.",

By formulating the low-rankness and robustness requirement within\nthe same framework and globally determining the ranks, the compressed DNNs can\nsimultaneously achieve high compression performance and strong adversarial\nrobustness.

Active learning (AL) algorithms are very helpful to\nobtain the most useful labels for training while keeping the total number of\nlabel queries under a certain budget. The existing Active Graph Embedding\nframework proposes to use centrality score, density score, and entropy score to\nevaluate the value of unlabeled nodes, and it has been shown to be capable of\nbringing some improvement to the node classification tasks of Graph\nConvolutional Networks. However, when evaluating the importance of unlabeled\nnodes, it fails to consider the influence of existing labeled nodes on the\nvalue of unlabeled nodes. In other words, given the same unlabeled node, the\ncomputed informative score is always the same and is agnostic to the labeled\nnode set. With the aim to address this limitation, in this work, we introduce 3\ndissimilarity-based information scores for active learning: feature\ndissimilarity score (FDS), structure dissimilarity score (SDS), and embedding\ndissimilarity score (EDS). We find out that those three scores are able to take\nthe influence of the labeled set on the value of unlabeled candidates into\nconsideration, boosting our AL performance.

The pruned model\nis usually specialized to meet specific hardware platforms and training tasks\n(defined as deployment scenarios). However, existing pruning approaches rely\nheavily on training data to trade off model size, efficiency, and accuracy,\nwhich becomes ineffective for federated learning (FL) over distributed and\nconfidential datasets. Moreover, the memory- and compute-intensive pruning\nprocess of most existing approaches cannot be handled by most FL devices with\nresource limitations. In this paper, we develop FedTiny, a novel distributed\npruning framework for FL, to obtain specialized tiny models for memory- and\ncomputing-constrained participating devices with confidential local data. To\nalleviate biased pruning due to unseen heterogeneous data over devices, FedTiny\nintroduces an adaptive batch normalization (BN) selection module to adaptively\nobtain an initially pruned model to fit deployment scenarios.

However, due to the\ncomplicated background textures and various text styles, existing methods fall\nshort in generating clear and legible edited text images. In this study, we\nattribute the poor editing performance to two problems: 1) Implicit decoupling\nstructure. Previous methods of editing the whole image have to learn different\ntranslation rules of background and text regions simultaneously. 2) Domain gap.\nDue to the lack of edited real scene text images, the network can only be well\ntrained on synthetic pairs and performs poorly on real-world images. To handle\nthe above problems, we propose a novel network by MOdifying Scene Text image at\nstrokE Level (MOSTEL). Firstly, we generate stroke guidance maps to explicitly\nindicate regions to be edited. Different from the implicit one by directly\nmodifying all the pixels at image level, such explicit instructions filter out\nthe distractions from background and guide the network to focus on editing\nrules of text regions. Secondly, we propose a Semi-supervised Hybrid Learning\nto train the network with both labeled synthetic images and unpaired real scene\ntext images. Thus, the STE model is adapted to real-world datasets\ndistributions. Moreover, two new datasets (Tamper-Syn2k and Tamper-Scene) are\nproposed to fill the blank of public evaluation datasets.

    "abstract": "Point cloud analysis is receiving increasing attention, however, most\nexisting point cloud models lack the practical ability to deal with the\nunavoidable presence of unknown objects. This paper mainly discusses point\ncloud analysis under open-set settings, where we train the model without data\nfrom unknown classes and identify them in the inference stage. Basically, we\npropose to solve open-set point cloud analysis using a novel Point Cut-and-Mix\nmechanism consisting of Unknown-Point Simulator and Unknown-Point Estimator\nmodules. Specifically, we use the Unknown-Point Simulator to simulate unknown\ndata in the training stage by manipulating the geometric context of partial\nknown data. Based on this, the Unknown-Point Estimator module learns to exploit\nthe point cloud's feature context for discriminating the known and unknown\ndata. Extensive experiments show the plausibility of open-set point cloud\nanalysis and the effectiveness of our proposed solutions.

In this work, we explore\nhow to exploit and conduct the prosperous detection-then-segmentation paradigm\nin 3D medical data, and propose a steerable, robust, and efficient computing\nframework for detection, identification, and segmentation of anatomies in CT\nscans. Considering complicated shapes, sizes and orientations of anatomies,\nwithout lose of generality, we present the nine degrees-of-freedom (9-DoF) pose\nestimation solution in full 3D space using a novel single-stage,\nnon-hierarchical forward representation. Our whole framework is executed in a\nsteerable manner where any anatomy of interest can be directly retrieved to\nfurther boost the inference efficiency. We have validated the proposed method\non three medical imaging parsing tasks of ribs, spine, and abdominal organs.\nFor rib parsing, CT scans have been annotated at the rib instance-level for\nquantitative evaluation, similarly for spine vertebrae and abdominal organs.\nExtensive experiments on 9-DoF box detection and rib instance segmentation\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our framework (with the identification rate of\n97.0% and the segmentation Dice score of 90.9%) in high efficiency, compared\nfavorably against several strong baselines (e.g., CenterNet, FCOS, and\nnnU-Net). For spine identification and segmentation, our method achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art result on the public CTSpine1K dataset.

    "abstract": "The real-world data tends to be heavily imbalanced and severely skew the\ndata-driven deep neural networks, which makes Long-Tailed Recognition (LTR) a\nmassive challenging task. Existing LTR methods seldom train Vision Transformers\n(ViTs) with Long-Tailed (LT) data, while the off-the-shelf pretrain weight of\nViTs always leads to unfair comparisons. In this paper, we systematically\ninvestigate the ViTs' performance in LTR and propose LiVT to train ViTs from\nscratch only with LT data. With the observation that ViTs suffer more severe\nLTR problems, we conduct Masked Generative Pretraining (MGP) to learn\ngeneralized features. With ample and solid evidence, we show that MGP is more\nrobust than supervised manners. In addition, Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss,\nwhich shows conspicuous performance with ViTs, encounters predicaments in LTR.\nWe further propose the balanced BCE to ameliorate it with strong theoretical\ngroundings. Specially, we derive the unbiased extension of Sigmoid and\ncompensate extra logit margins to deploy it. Our Bal-BCE contributes to the\nquick convergence of ViTs in just a few epochs. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that with MGP and Bal-BCE, LiVT successfully trains ViTs well\nwithout any additional data and outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods\nsignificantly, e.g., our ViT-B achieves 81.0% Top-1 accuracy in iNaturalist\n2018 without bells and whistles.

In this paper, we revisit this design and eschew the\nseparate architecture and training in favor of a single Transformer that\nperforms Retrieval as Attention (ReAtt), and end-to-end training solely based\non supervision from the end QA task.

Anomalies are rare and hard\nto collect and supervised models easily over-fit to these seen anomalies with a\nhandful of abnormal samples, producing unsatisfactory performance. On the other\nhand, anomalies are typically subtle, hard to discern, and of various\nappearance, making it difficult to detect anomalies and let alone locate\nanomalous regions. To address these issues, we propose a framework called\nPrototypical Residual Network (PRN), which learns feature residuals of varying\nscales and sizes between anomalous and normal patterns to accurately\nreconstruct the segmentation maps of anomalous regions. PRN mainly consists of\ntwo parts: multi-scale prototypes that explicitly represent the residual\nfeatures of anomalies to normal patterns; a multisize self-attention mechanism\nthat enables variable-sized anomalous feature learning. Besides, we present a\nvariety of anomaly generation strategies that consider both seen and unseen\nappearance variance to enlarge and diversify anomalies.

We also evaluate and compare the impact of\nco-renaming and the relationships between identifiers when inflections occur in\nthe words in identifiers are taken into account. Results: We revealed several\nrelationships of identifiers that are frequently found in the co-renamed\nidentifiers, such as the identifiers of methods in the same class or an\nidentifier defining a variable and another used for initializing the variable,\ndepending on the type of the renamed identifiers.

To craft robust data, Refiner\npromotes the gradients of critical parameters associated with robust data to\nclose ground-truth ones while leaving the gradients of trivial parameters to\nsafeguard privacy. Moreover, to exploit the gradients of trivial parameters,\nRefiner utilizes a well-designed evaluation network to steer robust data far\naway from ground-truth data, thereby alleviating privacy leakage risk.\nExtensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nsuperior defense effectiveness of Refiner at defending against state-of-the-art\nthreats.",

In this paper, we performed a preliminary analysis to check whether if\nit would be possible to utilize spoken speech electroencephalography data to\ndecode imagined speech, by simply applying the pre-trained model with spoken\nspeech brain signals to decode imagined speech brain signals. While the\nclassification performance of imagined speech data solely used to train and\nvalidation was 30.5 \\%, the transferred performance of spoken speech based\nclassifier to imagined speech data was 26.8 \\% with no significant difference\nfound compared to the imagined speech based classifier (p = 0.0983, chi-square\n= 4.64). For more comprehensive analysis, we compared the result with the\nvisual imagery dataset, which would naturally be less related to spoken speech\ncompared to the imagined speech. As a result, visual imagery have shown solely\ntrained performance of 31.8 \\% and transferred performance of 26.3 \\% which had\nshown significant statistical difference between each other (p = 0.022,\nchi-square = 7.64). Our results imply the potential of applying spoken speech\nto decode imagined speech, as well as their underlying common features.",

During each round, each\nagent samples a minibatch of training data and sends his gradient update. As an\nincreasing function of his minibatch size choice, the agent incurs a cost\nassociated with the data collection, gradient computation and communication.\nThe agents have the freedom to choose their minibatch size and may even opt out\nfrom training. To reduce his cost, an agent may diminish his minibatch size,\nwhich may also cause an increase in the noise level of the gradient update. The\nserver can offer rewards to compensate the agents for their costs and to\nincentivize their participation but she lacks the capability of validating the\ntrue minibatch sizes of the agents. To tackle this challenge, the proposed\nreward mechanism evaluates the quality of each agent's gradient according to\nthe its distance to a reference which is constructed from the gradients\nprovided by other agents.

    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have achieved great success in graph\nrepresentation learning by extracting high-level features from nodes and their\ntopology. Since GCNs generally follow a message-passing mechanism, each node\naggregates information from its first-order neighbour to update its\nrepresentation. As a result, the representations of nodes with edges between\nthem should be positively correlated and thus can be considered positive\nsamples. However, there are more non-neighbour nodes in the whole graph, which\nprovide diverse and useful information for the representation update. Two\nnon-adjacent nodes usually have different representations, which can be seen as\nnegative samples. Besides the node representations, the structural information\nof the graph is also crucial for learning. In this paper, we used\nquality-diversity decomposition in determinant point processes (DPP) to obtain\ndiverse negative samples. When defining a distribution on diverse subsets of\nall non-neighbouring nodes, we incorporate both graph structure information and\nnode representations. Since the DPP sampling process requires matrix eigenvalue\ndecomposition, we propose a new shortest-path-base method to improve\ncomputational efficiency. Finally, we incorporate the obtained negative samples\ninto the graph convolution operation. The ideas are evaluated empirically in\nexperiments on node classification tasks. These experiments show that the newly\nproposed methods not only improve the overall performance of standard\nrepresentation learning but also significantly alleviate over-smoothing\nproblems.",

With the widespread use of the Internet of Things\n(IoT), IoT data has become readily available and can provide valuable context\ninformation about business processes. As such, process analytics can benefit\nfrom incorporating IoT data into event logs to support more comprehensive,\ncontext-aware analyses.

In\nthe short-time Fourier transform (STFT) domain, the proposed network processes\neach frequency independently, and all frequencies use a shared network. For\neach frequency, the network performs end-to-end speech separation, namely\ntaking as input the STFT coefficients of microphone signals, and predicting the\nseparated STFT coefficients of multiple speakers. The proposed network learns\nto cluster the frame-wise spatial/steering vectors that belong to different\nspeakers. It is mainly composed of three components. First, a self-attention\nnetwork. Clustering of spatial vectors shares a similar principle with the\nself-attention mechanism in the sense of computing the similarity of vectors\nand then aggregating similar vectors. Second, a convolutional feed-forward\nnetwork. The convolutional layers are employed for signal smoothing and\nreverberation processing. Third, a novel hidden-layer normalization method,\ni.e. group batch normalization (GBN), is especially designed for the proposed\nnarrow-band network to maintain the distribution of hidden units over\nfrequencies. Overall, the proposed network is named NBC2, as it is a revised\nversion of our previous NBC (narrow-band conformer) network. Experiments show\nthat 1) the proposed network outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a\nlarge margin, 2) the proposed GBN improves the signal-to-distortion ratio by 3\ndB, relative to other normalization methods, such as batch/layer/group\nnormalization, 3) the proposed narrow-band network is spectrum-agnostic, as it\ndoes not learn spectral patterns, and 4) the proposed network is indeed\nperforming frame clustering (demonstrated by the attention maps).",

The solutions to these problems are generally based\non their respective assumptions, \\ie{the static world assumption for\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the accurate ego-pose\nassumption for object tracking}. However, these assumptions are challenging to\nhold in dynamic road scenarios, where SLAM and object tracking become closely\ncorrelated. Therefore, we propose DL-SLOT, a dynamic LiDAR SLAM and object\ntracking method, to simultaneously address these two coupled problems. This\nmethod integrates the state estimations of both the autonomous vehicle and the\nstationary and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization\nframework. First, we used object detection to identify all points belonging to\npotentially dynamic objects. Subsequently, a LiDAR odometry was conducted using\nthe filtered point cloud. Simultaneously, we proposed a sliding window-based\nobject association method that accurately associates objects according to the\nhistorical trajectories of tracked objects. The ego-states and those of the\nstationary and dynamic objects are integrated into the sliding window-based\ncollaborative graph optimization. The stationary objects are subsequently\nrestored from the potentially dynamic object set. Finally, a global pose-graph\nis implemented to eliminate the accumulated error. Experiments on KITTI\ndatasets demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than SLAM and\nobject tracking baseline methods. This confirms that solving SLAM and object\ntracking simultaneously is mutually advantageous, dramatically improving the\nrobustness and accuracy of SLAM and object tracking in dynamic road scenarios.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Contrast for Unsupervised Skeleton-based Action  Representation Learning",
    "abstract": "This paper targets unsupervised skeleton-based action representation learning\nand proposes a new Hierarchical Contrast (HiCo) framework. Different from the\nexisting contrastive-based solutions that typically represent an input skeleton\nsequence into instance-level features and perform contrast holistically, our\nproposed HiCo represents the input into multiple-level features and performs\ncontrast in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, given a human skeleton\nsequence, we represent it into multiple feature vectors of different\ngranularities from both temporal and spatial domains via sequence-to-sequence\n(S2S) encoders and unified downsampling modules. Besides, the hierarchical\ncontrast is conducted in terms of four levels: instance level, domain level,\nclip level, and part level. Moreover, HiCo is orthogonal to the S2S encoder,\nwhich allows us to flexibly embrace state-of-the-art S2S encoders. Extensive\nexperiments on four datasets, i.e., NTU-60, NTU-120, PKU-MMD I and II, show\nthat HiCo achieves a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised skeleton-based\naction representation learning in two downstream tasks including action\nrecognition and retrieval, and its learned action representation is of good\ntransferability. Besides, we also show that our framework is effective for\nsemi-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/HuiGuanLab/HiCo.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic gradients closely relate to both optimization and generalization\nof deep neural networks (DNNs). Some works attempted to explain the success of\nstochastic optimization for deep learning by the arguably heavy-tail properties\nof gradient noise, while other works presented theoretical and empirical\nevidence against the heavy-tail hypothesis on gradient noise. Unfortunately,\nformal statistical tests for analyzing the structure and heavy tails of\nstochastic gradients in deep learning are still under-explored. In this paper,\nwe mainly make two contributions. First, we conduct formal statistical tests on\nthe distribution of stochastic gradients and gradient noise across both\nparameters and iterations. Our statistical tests reveal that dimension-wise\ngradients usually exhibit power-law heavy tails, while iteration-wise gradients\nand stochastic gradient noise caused by minibatch training usually do not\nexhibit power-law heavy tails. Second, we further discover that the covariance\nspectra of stochastic gradients have the power-law structures in deep learning.\nWhile previous papers believed that the anisotropic structure of stochastic\ngradients matters to deep learning, they did not expect the gradient covariance\ncan have such an elegant mathematical structure. Our work challenges the\nexisting belief and provides novel insights on the structure of stochastic\ngradients in deep learning.",

The recording device source features include spatial\ninformation and certain temporal information. However, most recording device\nsource identification methods based on deep learning only use spatial\nrepresentation learning from recording device source features, which cannot\nmake full use of recording device source information. Therefore, in this paper,\nto fully explore the spatial information and temporal information of recording\ndevice source, we propose a new method for recording device source\nidentification based on the fusion of spatial feature information and temporal\nfeature information by using an end-to-end framework. From a feature\nperspective, we designed two kinds of networks to extract recording device\nsource spatial and temporal information. Afterward, we use the attention\nmechanism to adaptively assign the weight of spatial information and temporal\ninformation to obtain fusion features. From a model perspective, our model uses\nan end-to-end framework to learn the deep representation from spatial feature\nand temporal feature and train using deep and shallow loss to joint optimize\nour network. This method is compared with our previous work and baseline\nsystem. The results show that the proposed method is better than our previous\nwork and baseline system under general conditions.",

Meanwhile, we take physical realizability into account, involving\nphysics dynamics and constraints of a placement. The packing policy should\nunderstand the 3D geometry of the object to be packed and make effective\ndecisions to accommodate it in the container in a physically realizable way.

Direct training in such space is prohibitively data intensive.\nWe instead propose a theoretically-provable method for candidate action\ngeneration to reduce the action space of RL and the learning burden. A\nparameterized policy is then learned to select the best placement from the\ncandidates. Equipped with an efficient method of asynchronous RL acceleration\nand a data preparation process of simulation-ready training sequences, a mature\npacking policy can be trained in a physics-based environment within 48 hours.\nThrough extensive evaluation on a variety of real-life shape datasets and\ncomparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, we demonstrate that our method\noutperforms the best-performing baseline on all datasets by at least 12.8% in\nterms of packing utility.",

Driving experience is\nextremely important for driver attention prediction, a skilled driver is able\nto effortlessly predict oncoming danger (before it becomes salient) based on\ndriving experience and quickly pay attention on the corresponding zones.\nHowever, the nonobjective driving experience is difficult to model, so a\nmechanism simulating driver experience accumulation procedure is absent in\nexisting methods, and the existing methods usually follow the technique line of\nsaliency prediction methods to predict driver attention. In this paper, we\npropose a FeedBack Loop Network (FBLNet), which attempts to model the driving\nexperience accumulation procedure. By over-and-over iterations, FBLNet\ngenerates the incremental knowledge that carries rich historically-accumulative\nlong-term temporal information. The incremental knowledge to our model is like\nthe driving experience to humans. Under the guidance of the incremental\nknowledge, our model fuses the CNN feature and Transformer feature that are\nextracted from the input image to predict driver attention.

However, using the\nmask embedding as the label to guide the generation of target features in the\ntwo branches may result in inadequate target representation and degrade the\nperformance. Besides, how to reasonably fuse the target features in the two\ndifferent branches rather than simply adding them together to avoid the adverse\neffect of one dominant branch has not been investigated. In this paper, we\npropose a novel framework that emphasizes Learning to Learn Better (LLB) target\nfeatures for SVOS, termed LLB, where we design the discriminative label\ngeneration module (DLGM) and the adaptive fusion module to address these\nissues. Technically, the DLGM takes the background-filtered frame instead of\nthe target mask as input and adopts a lightweight encoder to generate the\ntarget features, which serves as the label of the online few-shot learner and\nthe value of the decoder in the transformer to guide the two branches to learn\nmore discriminative target representation. The adaptive fusion module maintains\na learnable gate for each branch, which reweighs the element-wise feature\nrepresentation and allows an adaptive amount of target information in each\nbranch flowing to the fused target feature, thus preventing one branch from\nbeing dominant and making the target feature more robust to distractor.\nExtensive experiments on public benchmarks show that our proposed LLB method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Data generated at the network edge can be processed locally by leveraging the\nparadigm of edge computing (EC). Aided by EC, decentralized federated learning\n(DFL), which overcomes the single-point-of-failure problem in the parameter\nserver (PS) based federated learning, is becoming a practical and popular\napproach for machine learning over distributed data. However, DFL faces two\ncritical challenges, \\ie, system heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity\nintroduced by edge devices. To ensure fast convergence with the existence of\nslow edge devices, we present an efficient DFL method, termed FedHP, which\nintegrates adaptive control of both local updating frequency and network\ntopology to better support the heterogeneous participants. We establish a\ntheoretical relationship between local updating frequency and network topology\nregarding model training performance and obtain a convergence upper bound. Upon\nthis, we propose an optimization algorithm, that adaptively determines local\nupdating frequencies and constructs the network topology, so as to speed up\nconvergence and improve the model accuracy. Evaluation results show that the\nproposed FedHP can reduce the completion time by about 51% and improve model\naccuracy by at least 5% in heterogeneous scenarios, compared with the\nbaselines.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic method for the selection of the Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) stage cost. We match the MPC feedback law to a\nproportional-integral (PI) controller, which we efficiently tune by\nhigh-performance Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. The PI tuning offers a wide range\nof tuning possibilities that is then inherited by the MPC design. The MC\nsimulation tuning of the PI controller is based on the minimization of two\ndifferent objectives; 1) the 2-norm tracking error, and 2) a bi-objective\nconsisting of the 2-norm tracking error and a 2-norm input rate of movement\npenalty. We apply the method to design MPC for an exothermic chemical reaction\nconducted in an adiabatic continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The process\nis of interest as the nonlinear dynamics result in a desired operating point\nvery close to a constraint. Our MPC design includes stage costs automatically\ndesigned to match the tuned PI controllers, hard input constraints, and a soft\noutput constraint. Stochastic simulation results show that both the PI\ncontroller and the MPC can track the desired operating point. However, the MPC\nshows reduced output constraint violation compared to the PI controller. As\nsuch, the MPC design method successfully combines the efficient tuning of the\nPI controller with the constraint handling properties of MPC.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) provides both challenges\nand opportunities for the planning and operations of distribution systems.\nThese resources can be deployed in a manner that is either complementary to or\nin competition with traditional network operations and planning as the DERs can\nprovide numerous important services to grid operators and utilities. This paper\npresents a novel method to estimate the trade off between DERs and traditional\ninvestments using a dynamic Peak-Load Pricing (PLP) methodology. PLP is a\npricing strategy for a time-dependent quantity of a non-storable commodity and\nis based on the theory of long-run marginal costs. Importantly PLP deals with\nthe trade-off between capacity utilization and consumer welfare. Therefore, the\ncapacity price is set at a point where the cost of investment is exactly offset\nby the additional social welfare that the investment would bring. Importantly\nit allows for capital cost recovery with no uplift payments. This dynamic PLP\nmethodology is an interactive planning and operations model based on the\nDynamic Monitoring and Decision Systems (DyMonDS) Framework which helps to\nalign physical, information, and economic incentives across many stakeholders\nwithin the electric energy system. The DyMonDS framework helps to solve the\ndrawbacks of PLP, which are related to the computational complexity of the PLP\nmodels considering different technologies with different payback periods over a\nlong investment horizon. Results show that the dynamic PLP model can accurately\nvalue the impact of different technologies in reducing congestion and\nincreasing the number of customers served. This allows the network operator to\neasily identify which technologies should be chosen in each investment cycle.",

However, although AI/ML has been introduced in wireless\nresearches long time ago, few datasets are commonly used in the research\ncommunity. Without a common dataset, AI-based methods proposed for wireless\nsystems are hard to compare with both the traditional baselines and even each\nother. The existing wireless AI researches usually rely on datasets generated\nbased on statistical models or ray-tracing simulations with limited\nenvironments. The statistical data hinder the trained AI models from further\nfine-tuning for a specific scenario, and ray-tracing data with limited\nenvironments lower down the generalization capability of the trained AI models.\nIn this paper, we present the Wireless AI Research Dataset (WAIR-D)1, which\nconsists of two scenarios.

The environments are randomly picked up\nfrom more than 40 cities in the real world map. The large volume of the data\nguarantees that the trained AI models enjoy good generalization capability,\nwhile fine-tuning can be easily carried out on a specific chosen environment.\nMoreover, both the wireless channels and the corresponding environmental\ninformation are provided in WAIR-D, so that extra-information-aided\ncommunication mechanism can be designed and evaluated.

However, we found that\nsome human anatomical keypoints kept their topology invariance, which can help\nto localize them more accurately when detecting the keypoints on the feature\nmap. But to the best of our knowledge, there is no literature that has\nspecifically studied it. Thus, in this paper, we present a novel 2D human pose\nestimation method with explicit anatomical keypoints structure constraints,\nwhich introduces the topology constraint term that consisting of the\ndifferences between the distance and direction of the keypoint-to-keypoint and\ntheir groundtruth in the loss object.

    "abstract": "Open-ended text generation with autoregressive language models (LMs) is one\nof the core tasks in natural language processing. However, maximization-based\ndecoding methods (e.g., greedy/beam search) often lead to the degeneration\nproblem, i.e., the generated text is unnatural and contains undesirable\nrepetitions. Existing solutions to this problem either introduce randomness\nprone to incoherence or require a look-ahead mechanism that demands extra\ncomputational overhead. In this study, we formulate open-ended text generation\nfrom a new perspective, i.e., we view it as an exploration process within a\ndirected graph. Thereby, we understand the phenomenon of degeneration as\ncircular loops within the directed graph. Based on our formulation, we propose\na novel decoding method -- \\textit{momentum decoding} -- which encourages the\nLM to \\textit{greedily} explore new nodes outside the current graph. Meanwhile,\nit also allows the LM to return to the existing nodes with a momentum\ndowngraded by a pre-defined resistance function. We extensively test our\napproach on three benchmarks from different domains through automatic and human\nevaluations. The results show that momentum decoding performs comparably with\nthe current state of the art while enjoying notably improved inference speed\nand computation FLOPs. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis to reveal\nthe merits and inner workings of our approach.

We compare two versions of our model-based RL\nalgorithm, one which uses a standard deep neural network based dynamics model\nand the other which uses a much more accurate, physics-informed neural network\nbased dynamics model. We show that, in environments that are not sensitive to\ninitial conditions, model accuracy matters only to some extent, as numerical\nerrors accumulate slowly.

Most of the\nexisting works focus on finding either sparse samplers with a fixed\nreconstructor or finding reconstructors with a fixed sampler.

In this\npaper, we propose an alternating training framework for finding a good pair of\nsamplers and reconstructors via deep reinforcement learning (RL). In\nparticular, we propose a novel sparse-reward Partially Observed Markov Decision\nProcess (POMDP) to formulate the MRI sampling trajectory.

However,\nexisting generative methods still have plenty of room for improvement in\nquantitative performance. More crucially, these methods are considered black\nboxes due to weak interpretability and there is rarely a theory trying to\nexplain their mechanism and learning process. In this study, we try to\nre-interpret these generative methods for image restoration tasks using\ninformation theory. Different from conventional understanding, we analyzed the\ninformation flow of these methods and identified three sources of information\n(extracted high-level information, retained low-level information, and external\ninformation that is absent from the source inputs) are involved and optimized\nrespectively in generating the restoration results. We further derived their\nlearning behaviors, optimization objectives, and the corresponding information\nboundaries by extending the information bottleneck principle.

However, the\nperformance of in-context learning is susceptible to the choice of prompt\nformat, training examples and the ordering of the training examples. In this\npaper, we propose a novel nearest-neighbor calibration framework for in-context\nlearning to ease this issue. It is inspired by a phenomenon that the in-context\nlearning paradigm produces incorrect labels when inferring training instances,\nwhich provides a useful supervised signal to calibrate predictions. Thus, our\nmethod directly augments the predictions with a $k$-nearest-neighbor ($k$NN)\nclassifier over a datastore of cached few-shot instance representations\nobtained by PLMs and their corresponding labels. Then adaptive neighbor\nselection and feature regularization modules are introduced to make full use of\na few support instances to reduce the $k$NN retrieval noise.

A fiber comprises an elastic core and an\nouter layer of a weaker brittle material. In recent tensile experiments on such\ncomposites, multiple cracks were observed to develop simultaneously on the\nouter layer. We propose here a simple one-dimensional model to predict such\nphenomenon. We idealize the problem as two axially loaded rods coupled by a\nlinear interfacial condition.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithm that relies on a series of dense and deep\nneural networks for passive microwave retrieval of precipitation. The neural\nnetworks learn from coincidences of brightness temperatures from the Global\nPrecipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) with the active\nprecipitating retrievals from the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR)\nonboard GPM as well as those from the {CloudSat} Profiling Radar (CPR). The\nalgorithm first detects the precipitation occurrence and phase and then\nestimates its rate, while conditioning the results to some key ancillary\ninformation including parameters related to cloud microphysical properties. The\nresults indicate that we can reconstruct the DPR rainfall and CPR snowfall with\na detection probability of more than 0.95 while the probability of a false\nalarm remains below 0.08 and 0.03, respectively. Conditioned to the occurrence\nof precipitation, the unbiased root mean squared error in estimation of\nrainfall (snowfall) rate using DPR (CPR) data is less than 0.8 (0.1) mm/hr over\noceans and land. Beyond methodological developments, comparing the results with\nERA5 reanalysis and official GPM products demonstrates that the uncertainty in\nglobal satellite snowfall retrievals continues to be large while there is a\ngood agreement among rainfall products. Moreover, the results indicate that CPR\nactive snowfall data can improve passive microwave estimates of global snowfall\nwhile the current CPR rainfall retrievals should only be used for detection and\nnot estimation of rates.",

This idea solves the\nbottleneck problem of difficulty in transmitting real-time remote monitoring\nsignal by NB-IoT technology. Single-chip microcontroller is innovatively\nembedded around the radiation source to monitor whether the source falls off.\nAs a result, when part or all of the source braid are not returned to the\nstorage location of the flaw detector, the gamma ray induction module, keying\nswitch, and radiation source braid locking mechanism remind the operator of the\ndangerous situation. At the same time, NB-IoT transmission system alarms\ncompanies and regulators of safety risks. In conclusion, radiation source can\nbe found timely when it falls off, to avoid radiation accident. Two bottlenecks\nrelated to installing GPS positioning system can be solved, that the GPS\npositioning system is installed on the flaw detector, and the radioactive\nsource is still unable to be controlled, and that the GPS positioning system\nrequires power to transmit the signal back to the regulatory platform or to the\nplatform of the flaw detection enterprise.

While most mere\nmachine learning methods are plagued by the lack of interpretability in\npractice, our novel hybrid approach will address this practical issue by\ngenerating explainable output. This analysis involves identifying what features\nand characteristics have the most significant impact on customers' purchase\nbehavior, thereby enabling us to predict future sales with a high level of\naccuracy, and identify the most impactful variables. Our results reveal that\ncustomers' product choice is insensitive to the promised delivery time, but\nthis factor significantly impacts customers' order quantity. We also show that\nthe effectiveness of various discounting methods depends on the specific\nproduct and the discount size. We identify product classes for which certain\ndiscounting approaches are more effective and provide recommendations on better\nuse of different discounting tools. Customers' choice behavior across different\nproduct classes is mostly driven by price, and to a lesser extent, by customer\ndemographics. The former finding asks for exercising care in deciding when and\nhow much discount should be offered, whereas the latter identifies\nopportunities for personalized ads and targeted marketing.

In\nthe first stage, a repeatable feature detector called the Multi-channel\nAuto-correlation of the Log-Gabor is presented for feature detection, which\ncombines the multi-channel auto-correlation strategy with the Log-Gabor\nwavelets to detect interest points with high repeatability and uniform\ndistribution. In the second stage, a rotation-invariant feature descriptor is\nconstructed, named the Rotation-invariant Maximum index map of the Log-Gabor,\nwhich consists of two components: fast assignment of dominant orientation and\nconstruction of feature representation. In the process of fast assignment of\ndominant orientation, a Rotation-invariant Maximum Index Map is built to\naddress rotation deformations. Then, the proposed RMLG incorporates the\nrotation-invariant RMIM with the spatial configuration of DAISY to depict a\nmore discriminative feature representation, which improves RMLGs resistance to\nradiation and rotation variances.",

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has revolutionized free viewpoint rendering\ntasks and achieved impressive results. However, the efficiency and accuracy\nproblems hinder its wide applications. To address these issues, we propose\nGeometry-Aware Generalized Neural Radiance Field (GARF) with a geometry-aware\ndynamic sampling (GADS) strategy to perform real-time novel view rendering and\nunsupervised depth estimation on unseen scenes without per-scene optimization.\nDistinct from most existing generalized NeRFs, our framework infers the unseen\nscenes on both pixel-scale and geometry-scale with only a few input images.\nMore specifically, our method learns common attributes of novel-view synthesis\nby an encoder-decoder structure and a point-level learnable multi-view feature\nfusion module which helps avoid occlusion. To preserve scene characteristics in\nthe generalized model, we introduce an unsupervised depth estimation module to\nderive the coarse geometry, narrow down the ray sampling interval to proximity\nspace of the estimated surface and sample in expectation maximum position,\nconstituting Geometry-Aware Dynamic Sampling strategy (GADS). Moreover, we\nintroduce a Multi-level Semantic Consistency loss (MSC) to assist more\ninformative representation learning. Extensive experiments on indoor and\noutdoor datasets show that comparing with state-of-the-art generalized NeRF\nmethods, GARF reduces samples by more than 25\\%, while improving rendering\nquality and 3D geometry estimation.",

However, these methods require access to a high-quality source\nlike Wikipedia and are limited to a single source of information. Large\nLanguage Models (LLM) trained on web-scale text show impressive abilities to\nrepurpose their learned knowledge for a multitude of tasks. In this work, we\nprovide a novel perspective on using an LLM to provide text supervision for a\nzero-shot image classification model.

Motivated by this, we propose a simple framework consisting of\nFeatureNorm: a norm of the feature map and NormRatio: a ratio of FeatureNorm\nfor ID and OOD to measure the OOD detection performance of each block. In\nparticular, to select the block that provides the largest difference between\nFeatureNorm of ID and FeatureNorm of OOD, we create Jigsaw puzzle images as\npseudo OOD from ID training samples and calculate NormRatio, and the block with\nthe largest value is selected. After the suitable block is selected, OOD\ndetection with the FeatureNorm outperforms other OOD detection methods by\nreducing FPR95 by up to 52.77% on CIFAR10 benchmark and by up to 48.53% on\nImageNet benchmark.

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the use of\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to support a wide variety of missions, such as\nremote surveillance, vehicle tracking, and object detection. For problems\ninvolving processing of areas larger than a single image, the mosaicking of UAV\nimagery is a necessary step. Real-time image mosaicking is used for missions\nthat requires fast response like search and rescue missions. It typically\nrequires information from additional sensors, such as Global Position System\n(GPS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), to facilitate direct orientation, or\n3D reconstruction approaches to recover the camera poses. This paper proposes a\nUAV-based system for real-time creation of incremental mosaics which does not\nrequire either direct or indirect camera parameters such as orientation\ninformation. Inspired by previous approaches, in the mosaicking process,\nfeature extraction from images, matching of similar key points between images,\nfinding homography matrix to warp and align images, and blending images to\nobtain mosaics better looking, plays important roles in the achievement of the\nhigh quality result. Edge detection is used in the blending step as a novel\napproach. Experimental results show that real-time incremental image mosaicking\nprocess can be completed satisfactorily and without need for any additional\ncamera parameters.",

    "abstract": "A new Lossy Causal Temporal Convolutional Neural Network Autoencoder for\nanomaly detection is proposed in this work. Our framework uses a\nrate-distortion loss and an entropy bottleneck to learn a compressed latent\nrepresentation for the task. The main idea of using a rate-distortion loss is\nto introduce representation flexibility that ignores or becomes robust to\nunlikely events with distinctive patterns, such as anomalies. These anomalies\nmanifest as unique distortion features that can be accurately detected in\ntesting conditions. This new architecture allows us to train a fully\nunsupervised model that has high accuracy in detecting anomalies from a\ndistortion score despite being trained with some portion of unlabelled\nanomalous data. This setting is in stark contrast to many of the\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised methodologies that require the model to be only\ntrained on \"normal data\". We argue that this partially violates the concept of\nunsupervised training for anomaly detection as the model uses an informed\ndecision that selects what is normal from abnormal for training. Additionally,\nthere is evidence to suggest it also effects the models ability at\ngeneralisation. We demonstrate that models that succeed in the paradigm where\nthey are only trained on normal data fail to be robust when anomalous data is\ninjected into the training. In contrast, our compression-based approach\nconverges to a robust representation that tolerates some anomalous distortion.\nThe robust representation achieved by a model using a rate-distortion loss can\nbe used in a more realistic unsupervised anomaly detection scheme.",

Existing studies focus on each of those aspects individually, however,\nthey do not account for how such decisions can be made jointly and adapted to\none another. In this work, we model the network system focusing on the training\nof DNNs, formalize the above multi-dimensional problem, and, given its\nNP-hardness, formulate an approximate dynamic programming problem that we solve\nthrough the PACT algorithmic framework.

    "abstract": "An important class of nonlinear weighted least-squares problems arises from\nthe assimilation of observations in atmospheric and ocean models. In\nvariational data assimilation, inverse error covariance matrices define the\nweighting matrices of the least-squares problem. For observation errors, a\ndiagonal matrix (i.e., uncorrelated errors) is often assumed for simplicity\neven when observation errors are suspected to be correlated. While accounting\nfor observationerror correlations should improve the quality of the solution,\nit also affects the convergence rate of the minimization algorithms used to\niterate to the solution. If the minimization process is stopped before reaching\nfull convergence, which is usually the case in operational applications, the\nsolution may be degraded even if the observation-error correlations are\ncorrectly accounted for. In this article, we explore the influence of the\nobservation-error correlation matrix (R) on the convergence rate of a\npreconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm applied to a one-dimensional\nvariational data assimilation (1D-Var) problem. We design the idealised 1D-Var\nsystem to include two key features used in more complex systems: we use the\nbackground error covariance matrix (B) as a preconditioner (B-PCG); and we use\na diffusion operator to model spatial correlations in B and R. Analytical and\nnumerical results with the 1D-Var system show a strong sensitivity of the\nconvergence rate of B-PCG to the parameters of the diffusion-based correlation\nmodels. Depending on the parameter choices, correlated observation errors can\neither speed up or slow down the convergence. In practice, a compromise may be\nrequired in the parameter specifications of B and R between staying close to\nthe best available estimates on the one hand and ensuring an adequate\nconvergence rate of the minimization algorithm on the other.",

With the\ndevelopment of digital technology, audio re-recording (AR) has become an\nefficient and covert means to steal secrets. AR process could drastically\ndestroy the watermark signal while preserving the original information. This\nputs forward a new requirement for audio watermarking at this stage, that is,\nto be robust to AR distortions. Unfortunately, none of the existing algorithms\ncan effectively resist AR attacks due to the complexity of the AR process. To\naddress this limitation, this paper proposes DeAR, a deep-learning-based audio\nre-recording resistant watermarking. Inspired by DNN-based image watermarking,\nwe pioneer a deep learning framework for audio carriers, based on which the\nwatermark signal can be effectively embedded and extracted. Meanwhile, in order\nto resist the AR attack, we delicately analyze the distortions that occurred in\nthe AR process and design the corresponding distortion layer to cooperate with\nthe proposed watermarking framework. Extensive experiments show that the\nproposed algorithm can resist not only common electronic channel distortions\nbut also AR distortions.

In this paper, we propose a Context-aware and\nBoundary-guided Network (CBN) to tackle these problems. In CBN, a basic text\ndetector is firstly used to predict initial segmentation results. Then, we\npropose a context-aware module to enhance text kernel feature representations,\nwhich considers both global and local contexts. Finally, we introduce a\nboundary-guided module to expand enhanced text kernels adaptively with only the\npixels on the contours, which not only obtains accurate text boundaries but\nalso keeps high speed, especially on high-resolution output maps. In\nparticular, with a lightweight backbone, the basic detector equipped with our\nproposed CBN achieves state-of-the-art results on several popular benchmarks,\nand our proposed CBN can be plugged into several segmentation-based methods.\nCode will be available on https://github.com/XiiZhao/cbn.pytorch.",

    "title": "Have You Ever Seen Malware?",
    "abstract": "To date, a large number of research papers have been written on the\nclassification of malware, its identification, classification into different\nfamilies and the distinction between malware and goodware. These works have\nbeen based on captured malware samples and have attempted to analyse malware\nand goodware using various techniques, including techniques from the field of\nartificial intelligence. For example, neural networks have played a significant\nrole in these classification methods. Some of this work also deals with\nanalysing malware using its visualisation. These works usually convert malware\nsamples capturing the structure of malware into image structures, which are\nthen the object of image processing. In this paper, we propose a very\nunconventional and novel approach to malware visualisation based on dynamic\nbehaviour analysis, with the idea that the images, which are visually very\ninteresting, are then used to classify malware concerning goodware. Our\napproach opens an extensive topic for future discussion and provides many new\ndirections for research in malware analysis and classification, as discussed in\nconclusion. The results of the presented experiments are based on a database of\n6 589 997 goodware, 827 853 potentially unwanted applications and 4 174 203\nmalware samples provided by ESET and selected experimental data (images,\ngenerating polynomial formulas and software generating images) are available on\nGitHub for interested readers. Thus, this paper is not a comprehensive compact\nstudy that reports the results obtained from comparative experiments but rather\nattempts to show a new direction in the field of visualisation with possible\napplications in malware analysis.",

    "abstract": "Co-speech gesture is crucial for human-machine interaction and digital\nentertainment. While previous works mostly map speech audio to human skeletons\n(e.g., 2D keypoints), directly generating speakers' gestures in the image\ndomain remains unsolved. In this work, we formally define and study this\nchallenging problem of audio-driven co-speech gesture video generation, i.e.,\nusing a unified framework to generate speaker image sequence driven by speech\naudio. Our key insight is that the co-speech gestures can be decomposed into\ncommon motion patterns and subtle rhythmic dynamics. To this end, we propose a\nnovel framework, Audio-driveN Gesture vIdeo gEneration (ANGIE), to effectively\ncapture the reusable co-speech gesture patterns as well as fine-grained\nrhythmic movements. To achieve high-fidelity image sequence generation, we\nleverage an unsupervised motion representation instead of a structural human\nbody prior (e.g., 2D skeletons). Specifically, 1) we propose a vector quantized\nmotion extractor (VQ-Motion Extractor) to summarize common co-speech gesture\npatterns from implicit motion representation to codebooks. 2) Moreover, a\nco-speech gesture GPT with motion refinement (Co-Speech GPT) is devised to\ncomplement the subtle prosodic motion details. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework renders realistic and vivid co-speech gesture\nvideo.

    "abstract": "Many solid mechanics problems on complex geometries are conventionally solved\nusing discrete boundary methods. However, such an approach can be cumbersome\nfor problems involving evolving domain boundaries due to the need to track\nboundaries and constant remeshing. In this work, we employ a robust smooth\nboundary method (SBM) that represents complex geometry implicitly, in a larger\nand simpler computational domain, as the support of a smooth indicator\nfunction. We present the resulting equations for mechanical equilibrium, in\nwhich inhomogeneous boundary conditions are replaced by source terms. The\nresulting mechanical equilibrium problem is semidefinite, making it difficult\nto solve. In this work, we present a computational strategy for efficiently\nsolving near-singular SBM elasticity problems. We use the block-structured\nadaptive mesh refinement (BSAMR) method for resolving evolving boundaries\nappropriately, coupled with a geometric multigrid solver for an efficient\nsolution of mechanical equilibrium. We discuss some of the practical numerical\nstrategies for implementing this method, notably including the importance of\ngrid versus node-centered fields. We demonstrate the solver's accuracy and\nperformance for three representative examples: a) plastic strain evolution\naround a void, b) crack nucleation and propagation in brittle materials, and c)\nstructural topology optimization. In each case, we show that very good\nconvergence of the solver is achieved, even with large near-singular areas, and\nthat any convergence issues arise from other complexities, such as stress\nconcentrations.

Despite the success of deep learning\narchitectures in other domains, deep GNNs still underperform their shallow\ncounterparts. There are many open questions about deep GNNs, but over-smoothing\nand over-squashing are perhaps the most intriguing issues. When stacking\nmultiple graph convolutional layers, the over-smoothing and over-squashing\nproblems arise and have been defined as the inability of GNNs to learn deep\nrepresentations and propagate information from distant nodes, respectively.\nEven though the widespread definitions of both problems are similar, these\nphenomena have been studied independently. This work strives to understand the\nunderlying relationship between over-smoothing and over-squashing from a\ntopological perspective. We show that both problems are intrinsically related\nto the spectral gap of the Laplacian of the graph. Therefore, there is a\ntrade-off between these two problems, i.e., we cannot simultaneously alleviate\nboth over-smoothing and over-squashing. We also propose a Stochastic Jost and\nLiu curvature Rewiring (SJLR) algorithm based on a bound of the Ollivier's\nRicci curvature. SJLR is less expensive than previous curvature-based rewiring\nmethods while retaining fundamental properties. Finally, we perform a thorough\ncomparison of SJLR with previous techniques to alleviate over-smoothing or\nover-squashing, seeking to gain a better understanding of both problems.",

The 5D tensor represents a 4D grid in which each axis corresponds to X,\nY, Z, and time and has 1D multi-channel features per element. Similar to\nTensoRF, we decompose the grid either into rank-one vector components (CP\ndecomposition) or low-rank matrix components (newly proposed MM decomposition).\nWe also use smoothing regularization to reflect the relationship between\nfeatures at different times (temporal dependency). We conduct extensive\nevaluations to analyze our models.

    "title": "An Approach for Detecting Dynamic Communities in Social Networks",
    "abstract": "Recent developments in the internet and technology have made major\nadvancements in tools that facilitate the collection of social data, opening up\nthus new opportunities for analyzing social networks. Social network analysis\nstudies the patterns of social relations and aims at discovering the hidden\nfeatures embedded in the structure of social networks. One of the most\nimportant features in social networks is community structure : densely knit\ngroups of individuals. The dynamic nature of interaction in social networks\noften challenges the detection of such community structures. The contributions\nin this thesis fall into two categories.The first category highlights the\nproblem of identifying overlapping communities over time. To carry out such\nanalysis, a framework called OLCPM (Online Label propagation and Clique\nPercolation Method) is proposed. It is an online algorithm based on clique\npercolation and label propagation methods. OLCPM has two main features : the\nfirst one is its ability to discover overlapping communities, while the second\nis its effectiveness in handling fine-grained temporal net works. As for as the\nsecond category is concerned, it emphasizes on the problem of analyzing\ncommunities that are embedded at different temporal scales. For example, in\nnetworks of interaction such as e-mails or phone calls, individuals are\ninvolved in daily as well as occasional conversations. We propose a first\nmethod for analyzing communities at multiple temporal scales. Hence, the\ndynamic network (link streams) is studied at different temporal granularities,\nand coherent communities (called stable communities) over a period of time are\ndetected at each temporal granularity. The two proposed approaches are\nvalidated on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",

    "title": "Addressing Distribution Shift at Test Time in Pre-trained Language  Models",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art pre-trained language models (PLMs) outperform other models\nwhen applied to the majority of language processing tasks. However, PLMs have\nbeen found to degrade in performance under distribution shift, a phenomenon\nthat occurs when data at test-time does not come from the same distribution as\nthe source training set. Equally as challenging is the task of obtaining labels\nin real-time due to issues like long-labeling feedback loops. The lack of\nadequate methods that address the aforementioned challenges constitutes the\nneed for approaches that continuously adapt the PLM to a distinct distribution.\nUnsupervised domain adaptation adapts a source model to an unseen as well as\nunlabeled target domain. While some techniques such as data augmentation can\nadapt models in several scenarios, they have only been sparsely studied for\naddressing the distribution shift problem. In this work, we present an approach\n(MEMO-CL) that improves the performance of PLMs at test-time under distribution\nshift. Our approach takes advantage of the latest unsupervised techniques in\ndata augmentation and adaptation to minimize the entropy of the PLM's output\ndistribution. MEMO-CL operates on a batch of augmented samples from a single\nobservation in the test set. The technique introduced is unsupervised,\ndomain-agnostic, easy to implement, and requires no additional data. Our\nexperiments result in a 3% improvement over current test-time adaptation\nbaselines.",

With the advent of renewable\npower resources and EVs resulting into uncertain generation and highly dynamic\nload demands, it has become ever so important to ensure robust operation of\npower networks through suitable management of transient stability issues and\nlocalize the events of blackouts. In the light of ever increasing stress on the\nmodern grid infrastructure and the grid operators, this paper presents a\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework, PowRL, to mitigate the effects of\nunexpected network events, as well as reliably maintain electricity everywhere\non the network at all times.

To\ntackle the viewpoint change, this work proposes to use a 3D dense pose\nestimation model and a texture mapping module to map the pedestrian images to\ncanonical view images. Due to the imperfection of the texture mapping module,\nthe canonical view images may lose the discriminative detail clues from the\noriginal images, and thus directly using them for ReID will inevitably result\nin poor performance. To handle this issue, we propose to fuse the original\nimage and canonical view image via a transformer-based module. The key insight\nof this design is that the cross-attention mechanism in the transformer could\nbe an ideal solution to align the discriminative texture clues from the\noriginal image with the canonical view image, which could compensate for the\nlow-quality texture information of the canonical view image. Through extensive\nexperiments, we show that our method can lead to superior performance over the\nexisting approaches in various evaluation settings.",

    "abstract": "MD4 and MD5 are seminal cryptographic hash functions proposed in early 1990s.\nMD4 consists of 48 steps and produces a 128-bit hash given a message of\narbitrary finite size. MD5 is a more secure 64-step extension of MD4. Both MD4\nand MD5 are vulnerable to practical collision attacks, yet it is still not\nrealistic to invert them, i.e. to find a message given a hash. In 2007, the\n39-step version of MD4 was inverted via reducing to SAT and applying a CDCL\nsolver along with the so-called Dobbertin's constraints. As for MD5, in 2012\nits 28-step version was inverted via a CDCL solver for one specified hash\nwithout adding any additional constraints. In this study, Cube-and-Conquer (a\ncombination of CDCL and lookahead) is applied to invert step-reduced versions\nof MD4 and MD5. For this purpose, two algorithms are proposed. The first one\ngenerates inversion problems for MD4 by gradually modifying the Dobbertin's\nconstraints. The second algorithm tries the cubing phase of Cube-and-Conquer\nwith different cutoff thresholds to find the one with minimal runtime\nestimation of the conquer phase. This algorithm operates in two modes: (i)\nestimating the hardness of an arbitrary given formula; (ii) incomplete\nSAT-solving of a given satisfiable formula. While the first algorithm is\nfocused on inverting step-reduced MD4, the second one is not area-specific and\nso is applicable to a variety of classes of hard SAT instances. In this study,\nfor the first time in history, 40-, 41-, 42-, and 43-step MD4 are inverted via\nthe first algorithm and the estimating mode of the second algorithm. 28-step\nMD5 is inverted for four hashes via the incomplete SAT-solving mode of the\nsecond algorithm.

Recent technological developments have led to big data processing,\nwhich resulted in significant computational difficulties when solving\nlarge-scale linear systems or inverting matrices. As a result, fast approximate\niterative matrix inversion methodologies via Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)\nacceleration have been a subject of extensive research, to find solutions where\nclassic and direct inversion are too expensive to conduct. In this work, we\ndevelop a new iterative algorithm based off the Neumann series (NS), which we\nnamed Nested-Neumann (NN). This new methodology generalizes higher order\nmethods by taking advantage of an iterative update of the preconditioning\nmatrix as a function of a given inception depth L, with an order equivalent to\nthe inception depth plus one.

We consider the widely-used\nenvy-based fairness properties of EF1 and EFX, in conjunction with the\nefficiency property of fractional Pareto-optimality (fPO). Existence (and\ncomputation) of an allocation that is simultaneously EF1/EFX and fPO are\nchallenging open problems, and we make progress on both of them. We show\nexistence of an allocation that is\n- EF1+fPO, when there are three agents,\n- EF1+fPO, when there are at most two disutility functions,\n- EFX+fPO, for three agents with bivalued disutilities. These results are\nconstructive, based on strongly polynomial-time algorithms. We also investigate\nnon-existence and show that an allocation that is EFX+fPO need not exist, even\nfor two agents.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new class of fading channels, built as the superposition of\ntwo fluctuating specular components with random phases, plus a clustering of\nscattered waves: the Multi-cluster Fluctuating Two-Ray (MFTR) fading channel.\nThe MFTR model emerges as a natural generalization of both the fluctuating\ntwo-ray (FTR) and the $\\kappa$-$\\mu$ shadowed fading models through a more\ngeneral yet equally mathematically tractable model. This generalization enables\nthe presence of additional multipath clusters in the purely ray-based FTR\nmodel, and the convenience of the new underlying fading channel model is\ndiscussed in depth. Then, we derive all the chief probability functions of the\nMFTR model (e.g., probability density function (PDF), cumulative density\nfunction (CDF), and moment generation function) in closed-form, having {a\nmathematical complexity similar to} other fading models in the\nstate-of-the-art. We also provide two additional analytical formulations for\nthe PDF and the CDF: (i) in terms of a continuous mixture of $\\kappa$-$\\mu$\nshadowed distributions, and (ii) as an infinite discrete mixture of Gamma\ndistributions. Such expressions enable to conduct performance analysis under\nMFTR fading by directly leveraging readily available results for the\n$\\kappa$-$\\mu$ shadowed or Nakagami-$m$ cases, respectively. The performance of\nwireless communications systems undergoing MFTR fading is exemplified in terms\nof a classical benchmarking metric like the outage probability, both in exact\nand asymptotic forms, and the amount of fading.",

    "abstract": "Existing neural rendering methods for creating human avatars typically either\nrequire dense input signals such as video or multi-view images, or leverage a\nlearned prior from large-scale specific 3D human datasets such that\nreconstruction can be performed with sparse-view inputs. Most of these methods\nfail to achieve realistic reconstruction when only a single image is available.\nTo enable the data-efficient creation of realistic animatable 3D humans, we\npropose ELICIT, a novel method for learning human-specific neural radiance\nfields from a single image. Inspired by the fact that humans can easily\nreconstruct the body geometry and infer the full-body clothing from a single\nimage, we leverage two priors in ELICIT: 3D geometry prior and visual semantic\nprior. Specifically, ELICIT introduces the 3D body shape geometry prior from a\nskinned vertex-based template model (i.e., SMPL) and implements the visual\nclothing semantic prior with the CLIP-based pre-trained models. Both priors are\nused to jointly guide the optimization for creating plausible content in the\ninvisible areas. In order to further improve visual details, we propose a\nsegmentation-based sampling strategy that locally refines different parts of\nthe avatar. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple popular benchmarks, including\nZJU-MoCAP, Human3.6M, and DeepFashion, show that ELICIT has outperformed\ncurrent state-of-the-art avatar creation methods when only a single image is\navailable.

    "abstract": "With the increased use of machine learning systems for decision making,\nquestions about the fairness properties of such systems start to take center\nstage. Most existing work on algorithmic fairness assume complete observation\nof features at prediction time, as is the case for popular notions like\nstatistical parity and equal opportunity. However, this is not sufficient for\nmodels that can make predictions with partial observation as we could miss\npatterns of bias and incorrectly certify a model to be fair. To address this, a\nrecently introduced notion of fairness asks whether the model exhibits any\ndiscrimination pattern, in which an individual characterized by (partial)\nfeature observations, receives vastly different decisions merely by disclosing\none or more sensitive attributes such as gender and race. By explicitly\naccounting for partial observations, this provides a much more fine-grained\nnotion of fairness.\nIn this paper, we propose an algorithm to search for discrimination patterns\nin a general class of probabilistic models, namely probabilistic circuits.\nPreviously, such algorithms were limited to naive Bayes classifiers which make\nstrong independence assumptions; by contrast, probabilistic circuits provide a\nunifying framework for a wide range of tractable probabilistic models and can\neven be compiled from certain classes of Bayesian networks and probabilistic\nprograms, making our method much more broadly applicable. Furthermore, for an\nunfair model, it may be useful to quickly find discrimination patterns and\ndistill them for better interpretability. As such, we also propose a\nsampling-based approach to more efficiently mine discrimination patterns, and\nintroduce new classes of patterns such as minimal, maximal, and Pareto optimal\npatterns that can effectively summarize exponentially many discrimination\npatterns",

With this idea, our training process is\nextremely simple, which performs standard masked image modeling on the stitch\nof input and output image pairs. This makes the model capable of performing\ntasks conditioned on visible image patches. Thus, during inference, we can\nadopt a pair of input and output images from the same task as the input\ncondition, to indicate which task to perform.\nWithout bells and whistles, our generalist Painter can achieve competitive\nperformance compared to well-established task-specific models, on seven\nrepresentative vision tasks ranging from high-level visual understanding to\nlow-level image processing. Painter significantly outperforms recent generalist\nmodels on several challenging tasks. Surprisingly, our model shows capabilities\nof completing out-of-domain tasks, which do not exist in the training data,\nsuch as open-category keypoint detection and object segmentation, validating\nthe powerful task transferability of in-context learning.",

    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion models hold great promise for generating diverse and\nrealistic human motions. However, existing motion diffusion models largely\ndisregard the laws of physics in the diffusion process and often generate\nphysically-implausible motions with pronounced artifacts such as floating, foot\nsliding, and ground penetration. This seriously impacts the quality of\ngenerated motions and limits their real-world application. To address this\nissue, we present a novel physics-guided motion diffusion model (PhysDiff),\nwhich incorporates physical constraints into the diffusion process.\nSpecifically, we propose a physics-based motion projection module that uses\nmotion imitation in a physics simulator to project the denoised motion of a\ndiffusion step to a physically-plausible motion. The projected motion is\nfurther used in the next diffusion step to guide the denoising diffusion\nprocess. Intuitively, the use of physics in our model iteratively pulls the\nmotion toward a physically-plausible space. Experiments on large-scale human\nmotion datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art motion quality\nand improves physical plausibility drastically (>78% for all datasets).",

    "abstract": "Computational drug repurposing is a cost- and time-efficient method to\nidentify new indications of approved or experimental drugs/compounds. It is\nespecially critical for emerging and/or orphan diseases due to its cheaper\ninvestment and shorter research cycle compared with traditional wet-lab drug\ndiscovery approaches. However, the underlying mechanisms of action between\nrepurposed drugs and their target diseases remain largely unknown, which is\nstill an unsolved issue in existing repurposing methods. As such, computational\ndrug repurposing has not been widely adopted in clinical settings. In this\nwork, based on a massive biomedical knowledge graph, we propose a computational\ndrug repurposing framework that not only predicts the treatment probabilities\nbetween drugs and diseases but also predicts the path-based, testable\nmechanisms of action (MOAs) as their biomedical explanations. Specifically, we\nutilize the GraphSAGE model in an unsupervised manner to integrate each\nentity's neighborhood information and employ a Random Forest model to predict\nthe treatment probabilities between pairs of drugs and diseases. Moreover, we\ntrain an adversarial actor-critic reinforcement learning model to predict the\npotential MOA for explaining drug purposing. To encourage the model to find\nbiologically reasonable paths, we utilize the curated molecular interactions of\ndrugs and a PubMed-publication-based concept distance to extract potential drug\nMOA paths from the knowledge graph as \"demonstration paths\" to guide the model\nduring the process of path-finding.

To simulate\nthis real-world scenario, we introduce LibriContinual, a continual learning\nbenchmark for speaker-specific domain adaptation derived from LibriVox\naudiobooks, with data corresponding to 118 individual speakers and 6 train\nsplits per speaker of different sizes. Additionally, current speech recognition\nmodels and continual learning algorithms are not optimized to be\ncompute-efficient.

Our\nexperiments show that the DisConformer models significantly outperform\nbaselines on general ASR i.e. LibriSpeech (15.58% rel. WER on test-other).

While many established algorithms for\npredicting the perceived quality of signals with monaural (timbral) distortions\nare available (PEAQ, POLQA), predicting the quality degradation of stereo and\nmulti-channel spatial signals is still considered a challenge. Audio quality\ndegradation arising from spatial distortions is usually measured in terms of\nwell known inter-aural cue distortion measures such as Inter-aural Level\nDifference Distortions (ILDD), Inter-aural Time Difference Distortions (ITDD)\nand Inter-aural Cross Correlation Distortions (IACCD).

We propose this technique called the \\convergence\nmap\" for generating particle stability diagrams similar to the frequency maps\nwidely used in accelerator physics to estimate dynamic aperture. The\nconvergence map provides similar information as the frequency map but in a much\nshorter computing time. The dynamic equation can be rewritten in terms of\naction-angle variables provided by the square matrix derived from the\naccelerator lattice. The convergence map is obtained by solving the exact\nnonlinear equation iteratively by the perturbation method using Fourier\ntransform and studying convergence. When the iteration is convergent, the\nsolution is expressed as a quasi-periodic analytical function as a highly\naccurate approximation, and hence the motion is stable. The border of stable\nmotion determines the dynamical aperture. As an example, we applied the new\nmethod to the nonlinear optimization of the NSLS-II storage ring and\ndemonstrated a dynamic aperture comparable to or larger than the nominal one\nobtained by particle tracking. The computation speed of the convergence map is\n30 to 300 times faster than the speed of the particle tracking, depending on\nthe size of the ring lattice (number of superperiods).

They can provide high quality entanglement\ndistribution service to end-users by performing quantum operations such as\nentanglement swapping and entanglement purification. In this work, we\ncharacterize the capacity region of such a quantum switch under noisy channel\ntransmissions and imperfect quantum operations. We express the capacity region\nas a function of the channel and network parameters (link and entanglement swap\nsuccess probability), entanglement purification yield and application level\nparameters (target fidelity threshold). In particular, we provide necessary\nconditions to verify if a set of request rates belong to the capacity region of\nthe switch.

We develop a max-weight scheduling policy and prove that the policy\nstabilizes the switch for all feasible request arrival rates. As we develop\nscheduling policies, we also generate new results for computing the conditional\nyield distribution of different classes of purification protocols. From\nnumerical experiments, we discover that performing link-level entanglement\npurification followed by entanglement swaps provides a larger capacity region\nthan doing entanglement swaps followed by end-to-end entanglement purification.\nThe conclusions obtained in this work can yield useful guidelines for\nsubsequent quantum switch designs.",

Regarding\nthe similarities between biological sequences and natural language sentences,\nthe novel BERT-based language techniques have been applied to extracting\ncomplex contextual features in various computational biology tasks such as\nprotein function/structure prediction. To speed up the research on enhancer\nidentification, it is urgent to construct a BERT-based enhancer language model.\nResults: In this paper, we propose a multi-scale enhancer identification\nmethod (iEnhancer-ELM) based on enhancer language models, which treat enhancer\nsequences as natural language sentences that are composed of k-mer nucleotides.\niEnhancer-ELM can extract contextual information of multi-scale k-mers with\npositions from raw enhancer sequences. Benefiting from the complementary\ninformation of k-mers in multi-scale, we ensemble four iEnhancer-ELM models for\nimproving enhancer identification. The benchmark comparisons show that our\nmodel outperforms state-of-the-art methods. By the interpretable attention\nmechanism, we finds 30 biological patterns, where 40% (12/30) are verified by a\nwidely used motif tool (STREME) and a popular dataset (JASPAR), demonstrating\nour model has a potential ability to reveal the biological mechanism of\nenhancer.\nAvailability: The source code are available at\nhttps://github.com/chen-bioinfo/iEnhancer-ELM\nContact: junjiechen@hit.edu.cn and junjie.chen.hit@gmail.com;\nSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics\nonline.",

    "abstract": "Empirical risk minimization (ERM) and distributionally robust optimization\n(DRO) are popular approaches for solving stochastic optimization problems that\nappear in operations management and machine learning. Existing generalization\nerror bounds for these methods depend on either the complexity of the cost\nfunction or dimension of the uncertain parameters; consequently, the\nperformance of these methods is poor for high-dimensional problems with\nobjective functions under high complexity. We propose a simple approach in\nwhich the distribution of uncertain parameters is approximated using a\nparametric family of distributions. This mitigates both sources of complexity;\nhowever, it introduces a model misspecification error. We show that this new\nsource of error can be controlled by suitable DRO formulations. Our proposed\nparametric DRO approach has significantly improved generalization bounds over\nexisting ERM / DRO methods and parametric ERM for a wide variety of settings.\nOur method is particularly effective under distribution shifts. We also\nillustrate the superior performance of our approach on both synthetic and\nreal-data portfolio optimization and regression tasks.",

In this paper, we propose a unified quantum algorithm framework for\nestimating properties of discrete probability distributions, with estimating\nR\\'enyi entropies as specific examples. In particular, given a quantum oracle\nthat prepares an $n$-dimensional quantum state\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sqrt{p_{i}}|i\\rangle$, for $\\alpha>1$ and $0<\\alpha<1$, our\nalgorithm framework estimates $\\alpha$-R\\'enyi entropy $H_{\\alpha}(p)$ to\nwithin additive error $\\epsilon$ with probability at least $2/3$ using\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{1-\\frac{1}{2\\alpha}}/\\epsilon +\n\\sqrt{n}/\\epsilon^{1+\\frac{1}{2\\alpha}})$ and\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{\\frac{1}{2\\alpha}}/\\epsilon^{1+\\frac{1}{2\\alpha}})$\nqueries, respectively.

The multi-layer structure models inference from deep\ngenerative priors, and the rotational invariance imposed on the weights\ngeneralizes the i.i.d.\\ Gaussian assumption by allowing for a complex\ncorrelation structure, which is typical in applications. In this work, we\npresent a new class of approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms and give a\nstate evolution recursion which precisely characterizes their performance in\nthe large system limit. In contrast with the existing multi-layer VAMP\n(ML-VAMP) approach, our proposed AMP -- dubbed multi-layer rotationally\ninvariant generalized AMP (ML-RI-GAMP) -- provides a natural generalization\nbeyond Gaussian designs, in the sense that it recovers the existing Gaussian\nAMP as a special case. Furthermore, ML-RI-GAMP exhibits a significantly lower\ncomplexity than ML-VAMP, as the computationally intensive singular value\ndecomposition is replaced by an estimation of the moments of the design\nmatrices.

    "abstract": "Quantifying the perceptual similarity of two images is a long-standing\nproblem in low-level computer vision. The natural image domain commonly relies\non supervised learning, e.g., a pre-trained VGG, to obtain a latent\nrepresentation. However, due to domain shift, pre-trained models from the\nnatural image domain might not apply to other image domains, such as medical\nimaging. Notably, in medical imaging, evaluating the perceptual similarity is\nexclusively performed by specialists trained extensively in diverse medical\nfields. Thus, medical imaging remains devoid of task-specific, objective\nperceptual measures. This work answers the question: Is it necessary to rely on\nsupervised learning to obtain an effective representation that could measure\nperceptual similarity, or is self-supervision sufficient? To understand whether\nrecent contrastive self-supervised representation (CSR) may come to the rescue,\nwe start with natural images and systematically evaluate CSR as a metric across\nnumerous contemporary architectures and tasks and compare them with existing\nmethods. We find that in the natural image domain, CSR behaves on par with the\nsupervised one on several perceptual tests as a metric, and in the medical\ndomain, CSR better quantifies perceptual similarity concerning the experts'\nratings. We also demonstrate that CSR can significantly improve image quality\nin two image synthesis tasks. Finally, our extensive results suggest that\nperceptuality is an emergent property of CSR, which can be adapted to many\nimage domains without requiring annotations.",

    "abstract": "The subrank of tensors is a measure of how much a tensor can be\n''diagonalized''. This parameter was introduced by Strassen to study fast\nmatrix multiplication algorithms in algebraic complexity theory and is closely\nrelated to many central tensor parameters (e.g. slice rank, partition rank,\nanalytic rank, geometric rank, G-stable rank) and problems in combinatorics,\ncomputer science and quantum information theory. Strassen (J. Reine Angew.\nMath., 1988) proved that there is a gap in the subrank when taking large powers\nunder the tensor product: either the subrank of all powers is at most one, or\nit grows as a power of a constant strictly larger than one. In this paper, we\nprecisely determine this constant for tensors of any order. Additionally, for\ntensors of order three, we prove that there is a second gap in the possible\nrates of growth. Our results strengthen the recent work of Costa and Dalai (J.\nComb. Theory, Ser. A, 2021), who proved a similar gap for the slice rank. Our\ntheorem on the subrank has wider applications by implying such gaps not only\nfor the slice rank, but for any ``normalized monotone''. In order to prove the\nmain result, we characterize when a tensor has a very structured tensor (the\nW-tensor) in its orbit closure.

When the demand to create end-to-end user entanglements is\nlow, QONs can generate and store maximally entangled Bell pairs (EPR pairs) at\nspecific overlay storage nodes of the network.

This is\nparticularly true for doing time-synchronized state estimation for a\ntransmission system that has minimal phasor measurement unit (PMU) coverage.\nThis paper proposes a Deep Neural network-based State Estimator (DeNSE) to\novercome this extreme unobservability problem. For systems in which the\nexisting PMU infrastructure is not able to bring the estimation errors within\nacceptable limits using the DeNSE, a data-driven incremental PMU placement\nmethodology is also introduced.

    "abstract": "While witnessing the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era and beyond,\nquantum federated learning (QFL) has recently become an emerging field of\nstudy. In QFL, each quantum computer or device locally trains its quantum\nneural network (QNN) with trainable gates, and communicates only these gate\nparameters over classical channels, without costly quantum communications.\nTowards enabling QFL under various channel conditions, in this article we\ndevelop a depth-controllable architecture of entangled slimmable quantum neural\nnetworks (eSQNNs), and propose an entangled slimmable QFL (eSQFL) that\ncommunicates the superposition-coded parameters of eS-QNNs. Compared to the\nexisting depth-fixed QNNs, training the depth-controllable eSQNN architecture\nis more challenging due to high entanglement entropy and inter-depth\ninterference, which are mitigated by introducing entanglement controlled\nuniversal (CU) gates and an inplace fidelity distillation (IPFD) regularizer\npenalizing inter-depth quantum state differences, respectively. Furthermore, we\noptimize the superposition coding power allocation by deriving and minimizing\nthe convergence bound of eSQFL. In an image classification task, extensive\nsimulations corroborate the effectiveness of eSQFL in terms of prediction\naccuracy, fidelity, and entropy compared to Vanilla QFL as well as under\ndifferent channel conditions and various data distributions.",

However,\nmany contemporary setups involve multiple related networks and, moreover, it is\noften the case that only a subset of nodes is observed while the rest remain\nhidden. Motivated by this, we propose a joint graph learning method that takes\ninto account the presence of hidden (latent) variables. Intuitively, the\npresence of the hidden nodes renders the inference task ill-posed and\nchallenging to solve, so we overcome this detrimental influence by harnessing\nthe similarity of the estimated graphs. To that end, we assume that the\nobserved signals are drawn from a Gaussian Markov random field with latent\nvariables and we carefully model the graph similarity among hidden (latent)\nnodes. Then, we exploit the structure resulting from the previous\nconsiderations to propose a convex optimization problem that solves the joint\ngraph learning task by providing a regularized maximum likelihood estimator.\nFinally, we compare the proposed algorithm with different baselines and\nevaluate its performance over synthetic and real-world graphs.",

    "abstract": "Segmenting the fine structure of the mouse brain on magnetic resonance (MR)\nimages is critical for delineating morphological regions, analyzing brain\nfunction, and understanding their relationships. Compared to a single MRI\nmodality, multimodal MRI data provide complementary tissue features that can be\nexploited by deep learning models, resulting in better segmentation results.\nHowever, multimodal mouse brain MRI data is often lacking, making automatic\nsegmentation of mouse brain fine structure a very challenging task. To address\nthis issue, it is necessary to fuse multimodal MRI data to produce\ndistinguished contrasts in different brain structures. Hence, we propose a\nnovel disentangled and contrastive GAN-based framework, named MouseGAN++, to\nsynthesize multiple MR modalities from single ones in a structure-preserving\nmanner, thus improving the segmentation performance by imputing missing\nmodalities and multi-modality fusion. Our results demonstrate that the\ntranslation performance of our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\nUsing the subsequently learned modality-invariant information as well as the\nmodality-translated images, MouseGAN++ can segment fine brain structures with\naveraged dice coefficients of 90.0% (T2w) and 87.9% (T1w), respectively,\nachieving around +10% performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art\nalgorithms. Our results demonstrate that MouseGAN++, as a simultaneous image\nsynthesis and segmentation method, can be used to fuse cross-modality\ninformation in an unpaired manner and yield more robust performance in the\nabsence of multimodal data.

    "abstract": "This paper considers adaptive radar electronic counter-counter measures\n(ECCM) to mitigate ECM by an adversarial jammer. Our ECCM approach models the\njammer-radar interaction as a Principal Agent Problem (PAP), a popular\neconomics framework for interaction between two entities with an information\nimbalance. In our setup, the radar does not know the jammer's utility. Instead,\nthe radar learns the jammer's utility adaptively over time using inverse\nreinforcement learning. The radar's adaptive ECCM objective is two-fold (1)\nmaximize its utility by solving the PAP, and (2) estimate the jammer's utility\nby observing its response. Our adaptive ECCM scheme uses deep ideas from\nrevealed preference in micro-economics and principal agent problem in contract\ntheory. Our numerical results show that, over time, our adaptive ECCM both\nidentifies and mitigates the jammer's utility.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement in synthetic speech generation technologies, great\ninterest in differentiating spoof speech from the natural speech is emerging in\nthe research community. The identification of these synthetic signals is a\ndifficult task not only for the cutting-edge classification models but also for\nhumans themselves. To prevent potential adverse effects, it becomes crucial to\ndetect spoof signals. From a forensics perspective, it is also important to\npredict the algorithm which generated them to identify the forger. This needs\nan understanding of the underlying attributes of spoof signals which serve as a\nsignature for the synthesizer. This study emphasizes the segments of speech\nsignals critical in identifying their authenticity by utilizing the Vocal Tract\nSystem(\\textit{VTS}) and Voice Source(\\textit{VS}) features.\nIn this paper, we propose a system that detects spoof signals as well as\nidentifies the corresponding speech-generating algorithm. We achieve 99.58\\% in\nalgorithm classification accuracy. From experiments, we found that a VS\nfeature-based system gives more attention to the transition of phonemes, while,\na VTS feature-based system gives more attention to stationary segments of\nspeech signals. We perform model fusion techniques on the VS-based and\nVTS-based systems to exploit the complementary information to develop a robust\nclassifier. Upon analyzing the confusion plots we found that WaveRNN is poorly\nclassified depicting more naturalness. On the other hand, we identified that\nsynthesizer like Waveform Concatenation, and Neural Source Filter is classified\nwith the highest accuracy. Practical implications of this work can aid\nresearchers from both forensics (leverage artifacts) and the speech communities\n(mitigate artifacts).",

Here, we report the first\ndemonstration of unidirectional imagers, presenting polarization-insensitive\nand broadband unidirectional imaging based on successive diffractive layers\nthat are linear and isotropic. These diffractive layers are optimized using\ndeep learning and consist of hundreds of thousands of diffractive phase\nfeatures, which collectively modulate the incoming fields and project an\nintensity image of the input onto an output FOV, while blocking the image\nformation in the reverse direction. After their deep learning-based training,\nthe resulting diffractive layers are fabricated to form a unidirectional\nimager. As a reciprocal device, the diffractive unidirectional imager has\nasymmetric mode processing capabilities in the forward and backward directions,\nwhere the optical modes from B to A are selectively guided/scattered to miss\nthe output FOV, whereas for the forward direction such modal losses are\nminimized, yielding an ideal imaging system between the input and output FOVs.\nAlthough trained using monochromatic illumination, the diffractive\nunidirectional imager maintains its functionality over a large spectral band\nand works under broadband illumination. We experimentally validated this\nunidirectional imager using terahertz radiation, very well matching our\nnumerical results. Using the same deep learning-based design strategy, we also\ncreated a wavelength-selective unidirectional imager, where two unidirectional\nimaging operations, in reverse directions, are multiplexed through different\nillumination wavelengths.

    "abstract": "Deep Learning has significantly impacted the application of data-to-decision\nthroughout research and industry, however, they lack a rigorous mathematical\nfoundation, which creates situations where algorithmic results fail to be\npractically invertible. In this paper we present a nearly invertible mapping\nbetween $\\mathbb{R}^{2^n}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ via a topological connection\nbetween $S^{2^n-1}$ and $S^n$. Throughout the paper we utilize the algebra of\nMulticomplex rotation groups and polyspherical coordinates to define two maps:\nthe first is a contraction from $S^{2^n-1}$ to $\\displaystyle \\otimes^n_{k=1}\nSO(2)$, and the second is a projection from $\\displaystyle \\otimes^n_{k=1}\nSO(2)$ to $S^{n}$. Together these form a composite map that we call the LG\nFibration. In analogy to the generation of Hopf Fibration using Hypercomplex\ngeometry from $S^{(2n-1)} \\mapsto CP^n$, our fibration uses Multicomplex\ngeometry to project $S^{2^n-1}$ onto $S^n$. We also investigate the algebraic\nproperties of the LG Fibration, ultimately deriving a distance difference\nfunction to determine which pairs of vectors have an invariant inner product\nunder the transformation. The LG Fibration has applications to Machine Learning\nand AI, in analogy to the current applications of Hopf Fibrations in adaptive\nUAV control. Furthermore, the ability to invert the LG Fibration for nearly all\nelements allows for the development of Machine Learning algorithms that may\navoid the issues of uncertainty and reproducibility that currently plague\ncontemporary methods. The primary result of this paper is a novel method of\nnearly invertible geometric dimensional reduction from $S^{2^n-1}$ to $S^n$,\nwhich has the capability to extend the research in both mathematics and AI,\nincluding but not limited to the fields of homotopy groups of spheres,\nalgebraic topology, machine learning, and algebraic biology.",

    "abstract": "Automated audio captioning is a cross-modal translation task for describing\nthe content of audio clips with natural language sentences. This task has\nattracted increasing attention and substantial progress has been made in recent\nyears. Captions generated by existing models are generally faithful to the\ncontent of audio clips, however, these machine-generated captions are often\ndeterministic (e.g., generating a fixed caption for a given audio clip), simple\n(e.g., using common words and simple grammar), and generic (e.g., generating\nthe same caption for similar audio clips). When people are asked to describe\nthe content of an audio clip, different people tend to focus on different sound\nevents and describe an audio clip diversely from various aspects using distinct\nwords and grammar. We believe that an audio captioning system should have the\nability to generate diverse captions, either for a fixed audio clip, or across\nsimilar audio clips. To this end, we propose an adversarial training framework\nbased on a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) to improve\ndiversity of audio captioning systems. A caption generator and two hybrid\ndiscriminators compete and are learned jointly, where the caption generator can\nbe any standard encoder-decoder captioning model used to generate captions, and\nthe hybrid discriminators assess the generated captions from different\ncriteria, such as their naturalness and semantics. We conduct experiments on\nthe Clotho dataset. The results show that our proposed model can generate\ncaptions with better diversity as compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

Recent unsupervised domain adaptation~(UDA) techniques leverage\nabundant labeled source data together with unlabeled target data to reduce the\ndomain gap, but these methods degrade significantly with limited source\nannotations. In this study, we address this underexplored UDA problem,\ninvestigating a challenging but valuable realistic scenario, where the source\ndomain not only exhibits domain shift~w.r.t. the target domain but also suffers\nfrom label scarcity. In this regard, we propose a novel and generic framework\ncalled ``Label-Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\"~(LE-UDA).

To assess the effectiveness of our method, we\nconduct extensive experiments on two different tasks for cross-modality\nsegmentation between MRI and CT images.

There are two challenges for this setting: 1) The optimal trade-off\nbetween optimizing the RL signal and the behavior cloning (BC) signal changes\non different states due to the variation of the action coverage induced by\ndifferent behavior policies. Previous methods fail to handle this by only\ncontrolling the global trade-off. 2) For a given state, the action distribution\ngenerated by different behavior policies may have multiple modes. The BC\nregularizers in many previous methods are mean-seeking, resulting in policies\nthat select out-of-distribution (OOD) actions in the middle of the modes. In\nthis paper, we address both challenges by using adaptively weighted reverse\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as the BC regularizer based on the TD3\nalgorithm. Our method not only trades off the RL and BC signals with per-state\nweights (i.e., strong BC regularization on the states with narrow action\ncoverage, and vice versa) but also avoids selecting OOD actions thanks to the\nmode-seeking property of reverse KL. Empirically, our algorithm can outperform\nexisting offline RL algorithms in the MuJoCo locomotion tasks with the standard\nD4RL datasets as well as the mixed datasets that combine the standard datasets.",

Challenging has been developing\nprincipled and interpretable approaches for fusing the modalities, specifically\napproaches enabling inference of latent source spaces representative of neural\nactivity. In this paper, we address this inference problem within the framework\nof transcoding -- mapping from a specific encoding (modality) to a decoding\n(the latent source space) and then encoding the latent source space to the\nother modality. Specifically, we develop a symmetric method consisting of a\ncyclic convolutional transcoder that transcodes EEG to fMRI and vice versa.\nWithout any prior knowledge of either the hemodynamic response function or lead\nfield matrix, the complete data-driven method exploits the temporal and spatial\nrelationships between the modalities and latent source spaces to learn these\nmappings. We quantify, for both the simulated and real EEG-fMRI data, how well\nthe modalities can be transcoded from one to another as well as the source\nspaces that are recovered, all evaluated on unseen data. In addition to\nenabling a new way to symmetrically infer a latent source space, the method can\nalso be seen as low-cost computational neuroimaging -- i.e. generating an\n'expensive' fMRI BOLD image from 'low cost' EEG data.",

    "abstract": "In the last two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has\nemerged as one of the most effective technologies in clinical research of the\nhuman brain. fMRI allows researchers to study healthy and pathological brains\nwhile they perform various neuropsychological functions. Beyond task-related\nactivations, the human brain has some intrinsic activity at a task-negative\n(resting) state that surprisingly consumes a lot of energy to support\ncommunication among neurons. Recent neuroimaging research has also seen an\nincrease in modeling and analyzing brain activity in terms of a graph or\nnetwork. Since graph models facilitate a systems-theoretic explanation of the\nbrain, they have become increasingly relevant with advances in network science\nand the popularization of complex systems theory. The purpose of this study is\nto look into the abnormalities in resting brain functions in adults with\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The primary goal is to\ninvestigate resting-state functional connectivity (FC), which can be construed\nas a significant temporal coincidence in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD)\nsignals between functionally related brain regions in the absence of any\nstimulus or task. When compared to healthy controls, ADHD patients have lower\naverage connectivity in the Supramarginal Gyrus and Superior Parietal Lobule,\nbut higher connectivity in the Lateral Occipital Cortex and Inferior Temporal\nGyrus. We also hypothesize that the network organization of default mode and\ndorsal attention regions is abnormal in ADHD patients.",

    "abstract": "In atomistic simulations of solids, ability to classify crystal phases and\nlattice defects in the presence of thermal fluctuations is essential for\ngaining deeper insights into the simulated dynamics. The need for accurate and\nefficient characterization methods is especially acute in presently emerging\nlarge-scale simulations of multi-phase systems far from equilibrium. Taking the\nperspective that delineating order and disorder features from ubiquitous\nthermal vibrations is akin to extracting signal from noise, we consider\nclassification of ordered phases and identification of disordered crystal\ndefects to be fundamentally the same problem and address them both with a\nunified approach: a denoising score function that removes thermal noise and\nrecovers any underlying crystalline order-disorder. Built on a rotationally\nequivariant graph neural network (NequIP), the denoiser was trained entirely\nwith synthetically noised structures and requires no simulation data during\ntraining. To demonstrate its denoising capabilities, the denoiser is shown to\neffectively remove thermal vibrations of BCC, FCC, and HCP crystal structures\nwithout impacting the underlying disordered defects, including point defects,\ndislocations, grain boundaries, and liquid disorder. In particular the denoiser\nwas applied to two relatively complex MD simulations that present practical\nchallenges: a Cu solidification trajectory involving a polymorphic nucleus, and\na trajectory of BCC Ta undergoing plastic deformation resulting in dislocation\nnetworks and point defect clusters. In both cases the denoiser facilitates or\ntrivializes the subsequent characterization of the order-disorder features.\nLastly, we outline future work to extend our denoising model to more complex\ncrystal structures and to multi-element systems.",

A state-of-the-art observational causal discovery algorithm for\ntime series capable of handling latent confounders and contemporaneous effects,\ncalled LPCMCI, is extended to profit from casual constraints found through\nrandomized control trials. Numerical results show that, given perfect\ninterventional constraints, the reconstructed structural causal models (SCMs)\nof the extended LPCMCI allow 84.6% of the time for the optimal prediction of\nthe target variable. The implementation of interventional and observational\ncausal discovery is modular, allowing causal constraints from other sources.\nThe second part of this thesis investigates the question of regret minimizing\ncontrol by simultaneously learning a causal model and planning actions through\nthe causal model. The idea is that an agent to optimize a measured variable\nfirst learns the system's mechanics through observational causal discovery. The\nagent then intervenes on the most promising variable with randomized values\nallowing for the exploitation and generation of new interventional data. The\nagent then uses the interventional data to enhance the causal model further,\nallowing improved actions the next time.\nThe extended LPCMCI can be favorable compared to the original LPCMCI\nalgorithm. The numerical results show that detecting and using interventional\nconstraints leads to reconstructed SCMs that allow 60.9% of the time for the\noptimal prediction of the target variable in contrast to the baseline of 53.6%\nwhen using the original LPCMCI algorithm.

    "abstract": "Covariate distribution shifts and adversarial perturbations present\nrobustness challenges to the conventional statistical learning framework:\nseemingly small unconceivable shifts in the test covariate distribution can\nsignificantly affect the performance of the statistical model learned based on\nthe training distribution. The model performance typically deteriorates when\nextrapolation happens: namely, covariates shift to a region where the training\ndistribution is scarce, and naturally, the learned model has little\ninformation. For robustness and regularization considerations, adversarial\nperturbation techniques are proposed as a remedy; however, more needs to be\nstudied about what extrapolation region adversarial covariate shift will focus\non, given a learned model. This paper precisely characterizes the extrapolation\nregion, examining both regression and classification in an infinite-dimensional\nsetting. We study the implications of adversarial covariate shifts to\nsubsequent learning of the equilibrium -- the Bayes optimal model -- in a\nsequential game framework. We exploit the dynamics of the adversarial learning\ngame and reveal the curious effects of the covariate shift to equilibrium\nlearning and experimental design. In particular, we establish two directional\nconvergence results that exhibit distinctive phenomena: (1) a blessing in\nregression, the adversarial covariate shifts in an exponential rate to an\noptimal experimental design for rapid subsequent learning, (2) a curse in\nclassification, the adversarial covariate shifts in a subquadratic rate fast to\nthe hardest experimental design trapping subsequent learning.",

    "abstract": "Malaria is a potentially fatal plasmodium parasite injected by female\nanopheles mosquitoes that infect red blood cells and millions worldwide yearly.\nHowever, specialists' manual screening in clinical practice is laborious and\nprone to error. Therefore, a novel Deep Boosted and Ensemble Learning (DBEL)\nframework, comprising the stacking of new Boosted-BR-STM convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN) and ensemble classifiers, is developed to screen malaria\nparasite images. The proposed STM-SB-BRNet is based on a new\ndilated-convolutional block-based split transform merge (STM) and feature-map\nSqueezing-Boosting (SB) ideas. Moreover, the new STM block uses regional and\nboundary operations to learn the malaria parasite's homogeneity, heterogeneity,\nand boundary with patterns. Furthermore, the diverse boosted channels are\nattained by employing Transfer Learning-based new feature-map SB in STM blocks\nat the abstract, medium, and conclusion levels to learn minute intensity and\ntexture variation of the parasitic pattern. The proposed DBEL framework\nimplicates the stacking of prominent and diverse boosted channels and provides\nthe generated discriminative features of the developed Boosted-BR-STM to the\nensemble of ML classifiers. The proposed framework improves the discrimination\nability and generalization of ensemble learning. Moreover, the deep feature\nspaces of the developed Boosted-BR-STM and customized CNNs are fed into ML\nclassifiers for comparative analysis. The proposed DBEL framework outperforms\nthe existing techniques on the NIH malaria dataset that are enhanced using\ndiscrete wavelet transform to enrich feature space. The proposed DBEL framework\nachieved accuracy (98.50%), sensitivity (0.9920), F-score (0.9850), and AUC\n(0.997), which suggest it to be utilized for malaria parasite screening.",
