    "title": "Testing Human Ability To Detect Deepfake Images of Human Faces",
    "abstract": "Deepfakes are computationally-created entities that falsely represent\nreality. They can take image, video, and audio modalities, and pose a threat to\nmany areas of systems and societies, comprising a topic of interest to various\naspects of cybersecurity and cybersafety. In 2020 a workshop consulting AI\nexperts from academia, policing, government, the private sector, and state\nsecurity agencies ranked deepfakes as the most serious AI threat. These experts\nnoted that since fake material can propagate through many uncontrolled routes,\nchanges in citizen behaviour may be the only effective defence. This study aims\nto assess human ability to identify image deepfakes of human faces\n(StyleGAN2:FFHQ) from nondeepfake images (FFHQ), and to assess the\neffectiveness of simple interventions intended to improve detection accuracy.\nUsing an online survey, 280 participants were randomly allocated to one of four\ngroups: a control group, and 3 assistance interventions. Each participant was\nshown a sequence of 20 images randomly selected from a pool of 50 deepfake and\n50 real images of human faces. Participants were asked if each image was\nAI-generated or not, to report their confidence, and to describe the reasoning\nbehind each response. Overall detection accuracy was only just above chance and\nnone of the interventions significantly improved this. Participants' confidence\nin their answers was high and unrelated to accuracy. Assessing the results on a\nper-image basis reveals participants consistently found certain images harder\nto label correctly, but reported similarly high confidence regardless of the\nimage. Thus, although participant accuracy was 62% overall, this accuracy\nacross images ranged quite evenly between 85% and 30%, with an accuracy of\nbelow 50% for one in every five images. We interpret the findings as suggesting\nthat there is a need for an urgent call to action to address this threat.",

    "abstract": "An emerging alternative to conventional Augmented Reality (AR) glasses\ndesigns, Beaming displays promise slim AR glasses free from challenging design\ntrade-offs, including battery-related limits or computational budget-related\nissues. These beaming displays remove active components such as batteries and\nelectronics from AR glasses and move them to a projector that projects images\nto a user from a distance (1-2 meters), where users wear only passive optical\neyepieces. However, earlier implementations of these displays delivered poor\nresolutions (7 cycles per degree) without any optical focus cues and were\nintroduced with a bulky form-factor eyepiece (50 mm thick). This paper\nintroduces a new milestone for beaming displays, which we call HoloBeam. In\nthis new design, a custom holographic projector populates a micro-volume\nlocated at some distance (1-2 meters) with multiple planes of images. Users\nview magnified copies of these images from this small volume with the help of\nan eyepiece that is either a Holographic Optical Element (HOE) or a set of\nlenses. Our HoloBeam prototypes demonstrate the thinnest AR glasses to date\nwith a submillimeter thickness (e.g., HOE film is only 120 um thick). In\naddition, HoloBeam prototypes demonstrate near retinal resolutions (24 cycles\nper degree) with a 70 degrees-wide field of view.",

    "title": "Structured Like a Language Model: Analysing AI as an Automated Subject",
    "abstract": "Drawing from the resources of psychoanalysis and critical media studies, in\nthis paper we develop an analysis of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated\nsubjects. We argue the intentional fictional projection of subjectivity onto\nLLMs can yield an alternate frame through which AI behaviour, including its\nproductions of bias and harm, can be analysed. First, we introduce language\nmodels, discuss their significance and risks, and outline our case for\ninterpreting model design and outputs with support from psychoanalytic\nconcepts. We trace a brief history of language models, culminating with the\nreleases, in 2022, of systems that realise state-of-the-art natural language\nprocessing performance. We engage with one such system, OpenAI's InstructGPT,\nas a case study, detailing the layers of its construction and conducting\nexploratory and semi-structured interviews with chatbots. These interviews\nprobe the model's moral imperatives to be helpful, truthful and harmless by\ndesign. The model acts, we argue, as the condensation of often competing social\ndesires, articulated through the internet and harvested into training data,\nwhich must then be regulated and repressed. This foundational structure can\nhowever be redirected via prompting, so that the model comes to identify with,\nand transfer, its commitments to the immediate human subject before it. In\nturn, these automated productions of language can lead to the human subject\nprojecting agency upon the model, effecting occasionally further forms of\ncountertransference. We conclude that critical media methods and psychoanalytic\ntheory together offer a productive frame for grasping the powerful new\ncapacities of AI-driven language systems.",

The Age of Information (AoI) is the time\nthat has elapsed since the most-recently delivered packet was generated, and\ncaptures the freshness of information. In the context of broadcast and\ncollection, we define the Age of Broadcast (AoB) to be the amount of time\nelapsed until all nodes receive a fresh update, and the Age of Collection (AoC)\nas the amount of time that elapses until the base station receives an update\nfrom all nodes.\nWe quantify the average broadcast and collection ages in two scenarios: 1)\ninstance-dependent, in which the locations of all nodes and interferers are\nknown, and 2) instance-independent, in which they are not known but are located\nrandomly, and expected age is characterized with respect to node locations. In\nthe instance-independent case, we show that AoB and AoC scale\nsuper-exponentially with respect to the radius of the region surrounding the\nbase station.

    "abstract": "During the deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices, many\nresearch efforts are devoted to the limited hardware resource. However, little\nattention is paid to the influence of dynamic power management. As edge devices\ntypically only have a budget of energy with batteries (rather than almost\nunlimited energy support on servers or workstations), their dynamic power\nmanagement often changes the execution frequency as in the widely-used dynamic\nvoltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique. This leads to highly unstable\ninference speed performance, especially for computation-intensive DNN models,\nwhich can harm user experience and waste hardware resources. We firstly\nidentify this problem and then propose All-in-One, a highly representative\npruning framework to work with dynamic power management using DVFS. The\nframework can use only one set of model weights and soft masks (together with\nother auxiliary parameters of negligible storage) to represent multiple models\nof various pruning ratios. By re-configuring the model to the corresponding\npruning ratio for a specific execution frequency (and voltage), we are able to\nachieve stable inference speed, i.e., keeping the difference in speed\nperformance under various execution frequencies as small as possible. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves high accuracy for\nmultiple models of different pruning ratios, but also reduces their variance of\ninference latency for various frequencies, with minimal memory consumption of\nonly one model and one soft mask.",

Due to the powerful\ncapability to gather information of neighborhood nodes, in this paper, we apply\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) to cope with heterogeneous-graph data\noriginating from multi-view data, which is still under-explored in the field of\nGCN. In order to improve the quality of network topology and alleviate the\ninterference of noises yielded by graph fusion, some methods undertake sorting\noperations before the graph convolution procedure. These GCN-based methods\ngenerally sort and select the most confident neighborhood nodes for each\nvertex, such as picking the top-k nodes according to pre-defined confidence\nvalues. Nonetheless, this is problematic due to the non-differentiable sorting\noperators and inflexible graph embedding learning, which may result in blocked\ngradient computations and undesired performance. To cope with these issues, we\npropose a joint framework dubbed Multi-view Graph Convolutional Network with\nDifferentiable Node Selection (MGCN-DNS), which is constituted of an adaptive\ngraph fusion layer, a graph learning module and a differentiable node selection\nschema. MGCN-DNS accepts multi-channel graph-structural data as inputs and aims\nto learn more robust graph fusion through a differentiable neural network. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method is verified by rigorous comparisons with\nconsiderable state-of-the-art approaches in terms of multi-view semi-supervised\nclassification tasks.",

    "abstract": "A key consideration in the development of numerical schemes for\ntime-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is the ability to preserve\ncertain properties of the continuum solution, such as associated conservation\nlaws or other geometric structures of the solution. There is a long history of\nthe development and analysis of such structure-preserving discretisation\nschemes, including both proofs that standard schemes have structure-preserving\nproperties and proposals for novel schemes that achieve both high-order\naccuracy and exact preservation of certain properties of the continuum\ndifferential equation. When coupled with implicit time-stepping methods, a\nmajor downside to these schemes is that their structure-preserving properties\ngenerally rely on exact solution of the (possibly nonlinear) systems of\nequations defining each time-step in the discrete scheme. For small systems,\nthis is often possible (up to the accuracy of floating-point arithmetic), but\nit becomes impractical for the large linear systems that arise when considering\ntypical discretisation of space-time PDEs.

In its 2D counterpart, recent advances have shown that similar\nproblems can be significantly alleviated by employing knowledge from other\nmodalities, such as language. Inspired by this, leveraging multimodal\ninformation for 3D modality could be promising to improve 3D understanding\nunder the restricted data regime, but this line of research is not well\nstudied. Therefore, we introduce ULIP to learn a unified representation of\nimage, text, and 3D point cloud by pre-training with object triplets from the\nthree modalities. To overcome the shortage of training triplets, ULIP leverages\na pre-trained vision-language model that has already learned a common visual\nand textual space by training with massive image-text pairs. Then, ULIP learns\na 3D representation space aligned with the common image-text space, using a\nsmall number of automatically synthesized triplets. ULIP is agnostic to 3D\nbackbone networks and can easily be integrated into any 3D architecture.\nExperiments show that ULIP effectively improves the performance of multiple\nrecent 3D backbones by simply pre-training them on ShapeNet55 using our\nframework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both standard 3D\nclassification and zero-shot 3D classification on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN.\nULIP also improves the performance of PointMLP by around 3% in 3D\nclassification on ScanObjectNN, and outperforms PointCLIP by 28.8% on top-1\naccuracy for zero-shot 3D classification on ModelNet40.

An intelligent demand response via load shifting\nincreases the energy efficiency of residential buildings by nudging residents\nto change their energy consumption behavior. This paper introduces an activity\nprediction-based framework for the utility-based context-aware multi-agent\nrecommendation system that generates an activity shifting schedule for a\n24-hour time horizon to either focus on CO2 emissions or energy cost savings.\nIn particular, we design and implement an Activity Agent that uses hourly\nenergy consumption data. It does not require further sensorial data or activity\nlabels which reduces implementation costs and the need for extensive user\ninput. Moreover, the system enhances the utility option of saving energy costs\nby saving CO2 emissions and provides the possibility to focus on both\ndimensions. The empirical results show that while setting the focus on CO2\nemissions savings, the system provides an average of 12% of emissions savings\nand 7% of cost savings. When focusing on energy cost savings, 20% of energy\ncosts and 6% of emissions savings are possible for the studied households in\ncase of accepting all recommendations. Recommending an activity schedule, the\nsystem uses the same terms residents describe their domestic life.

    "abstract": "There has been a recent effort in applying differential privacy on memory\naccess patterns to enhance data privacy. This is called differential\nobliviousness. Differential obliviousness is a promising direction because it\nprovides a principled trade-off between performance and desired level of\nprivacy. To date, it is still an open question whether differential\nobliviousness can speed up database processing with respect to full\nobliviousness. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of three\nnew major database operators: selection with projection, grouping with\naggregation, and foreign key join.

    "title": "State-Regularized Recurrent Neural Networks to Extract Automata and  Explain Predictions",
    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks are a widely used class of neural architectures.\nThey have, however, two shortcomings. First, they are often treated as\nblack-box models and as such it is difficult to understand what exactly they\nlearn as well as how they arrive at a particular prediction. Second, they tend\nto work poorly on sequences requiring long-term memorization, despite having\nthis capacity in principle. We aim to address both shortcomings with a class of\nrecurrent networks that use a stochastic state transition mechanism between\ncell applications. This mechanism, which we term state-regularization, makes\nRNNs transition between a finite set of learnable states. We evaluate\nstate-regularized RNNs on (1) regular languages for the purpose of automata\nextraction; (2) non-regular languages such as balanced parentheses and\npalindromes where external memory is required; and (3) real-word sequence\nlearning tasks for sentiment analysis, visual object recognition and text\ncategorisation. We show that state-regularization (a) simplifies the extraction\nof finite state automata that display an RNN's state transition dynamic; (b)\nforces RNNs to operate more like automata with external memory and less like\nfinite state machines, which potentiality leads to a more structural memory;\n(c) leads to better interpretability and explainability of RNNs by leveraging\nthe probabilistic finite state transition mechanism over time steps.",

    "abstract": "As an important contributor to GDP growth, the construction industry is\nsuffering from labor shortage due to population ageing, COVID-19 pandemic, and\nharsh environments. Considering the complexity and dynamics of construction\nenvironment, it is still challenging to develop fully automated robots. For a\nlong time in the future, workers and robots will coexist and collaborate with\neach other to build or maintain a facility efficiently. As an emerging field,\nhuman-robot collaboration (HRC) still faces various open problems. To this end,\nthis pioneer research introduces an agent-based modeling approach to\ninvestigate the coupling effect and scale effect of HRC in the bricklaying\nprocess. With multiple experiments based on simulation, the dynamic and complex\nnature of HRC is illustrated in two folds: 1) agents in HRC are interdependent\ndue to human factors of workers, features of robots, and their collaboration\nbehaviors; 2) different parameters of HRC are correlated and have significant\nimpacts on construction productivity (CP). Accidentally and interestingly, it\nis discovered that HRC has a scale effect on CP, which means increasing the\nnumber of collaborated human-robot teams will lead to higher CP even if the\nhuman-robot ratio keeps unchanged. Overall, it is argued that more\ninvestigations in HRC are needed for efficient construction, occupational\nsafety, etc.; and this research can be taken as a stepstone for developing and\nevaluating new robots, optimizing HRC processes, and even training future\nindustrial workers in the construction industry.",

    "title": "Adaptive analysis-aware defeaturing",
    "abstract": "Removing geometrical details from a complex domain is a classical operation\nin computer aided design for simulation and manufacturing. This procedure\nsimplifies the meshing process, and it enables faster simulations with less\nmemory requirements. But depending on the partial differential equation that\none wants to solve, removing some important geometrical features may greatly\nimpact the solution accuracy. For instance, in solid mechanics simulations,\nsuch features can be holes or fillets near stress concentration regions.\nUnfortunately, the effect of geometrical simplification on the accuracy of the\nproblem solution is often neglected, or its evaluation is based on engineering\nexpertise only due to the lack of reliable tools. It is therefore important to\nhave a better understanding of the effect of geometrical model simplification,\nalso called defeaturing, to improve our control on the simulation accuracy\nalong the design and analysis phase. In this work, we consider the Poisson\nequation as a model problem, we focus on isogeometric discretizations, and we\nbuild an adaptive strategy that is twofold. Firstly, it performs standard mesh\nrefinement in a (potentially trimmed multipatch) defeatured geometry described\nvia truncated hierarchical B-splines. Secondly, it is also able to perform\ngeometrical refinement, that is, to choose at each iteration step which\ngeometrical feature is important to obtain an accurate solution. To drive this\nadaptive strategy, we introduce an a posteriori estimator of the energy error\nbetween the exact solution defined in the exact fully-featured geometry, and\nthe numerical approximation of the solution defined in the defeatured geometry.\nThe reliability of the estimator is proven for very general geometric\nconfigurations, and numerical experiments are performed to validate the\npresented theory and to illustrate the capabilities of the proposed adaptive\nstrategy.",

As new concepts emerge in a domain, knowledge\ngraphs must be expanded to preserve machine learning performance. Manually\nexpanding knowledge graphs, however, is infeasible at scale. In this work, we\npropose a method for knowledge graph expansion with humans-in-the-loop.\nConcretely, given a knowledge graph, our method predicts the \"parents\" of new\nconcepts to be added to this graph for further verification by human experts.\nWe show that our method is both accurate and provably \"human-friendly\".\nSpecifically, we prove that our method predicts parents that are \"near\"\nconcepts' true parents in the knowledge graph, even when the predictions are\nincorrect. We then show, with a controlled experiment, that satisfying this\nproperty increases both the speed and the accuracy of the human-algorithm\ncollaboration. We further evaluate our method on a knowledge graph from\nPinterest and show that it outperforms competing methods on both accuracy and\nhuman-friendliness. Upon deployment in production at Pinterest, our method\nreduced the time needed for knowledge graph expansion by ~400% (compared to\nmanual expansion), and contributed to a subsequent increase in ad revenue of\n20%.",

    "abstract": "GossipSub is a new peer-to-peer communication protocol designed to counter\nattacks from misbehaving peers by carefully controlling what information is\ndisseminated and to whom, via a score function computed by each peer that\ncaptures positive and negative behaviors of its neighbors. The score function\ndepends on several parameters (weights, caps, thresholds, etc.) that can be\nconfigured by applications using GossipSub. The specification for GossipSub is\nwritten in English and its resilience to attacks from misbehaving peers is\nsupported empirically by emulation testing using an implementation in Golang.\nIn this work we take a foundational approach to understanding the resilience\nof GossipSub to attacks from misbehaving peers. We build the first formal model\nof GossipSub, using the ACL2s theorem prover. Our model is officially endorsed\nby GossipSub developers. It can simulate GossipSub networks of arbitrary size\nand topology, with arbitrarily configured peers, and can be used to prove and\ndisprove theorems about the protocol. We formalize fundamental security\nproperties stating that the score function is fair, penalizes bad behavior and\nrewards good behavior. We prove that the score function is always fair, but can\nbe configured in ways that either penalize good behavior or ignore bad\nbehavior. Using our model, we run GossipSub with the specific configurations\nfor two popular real-world applications: the FileCoin and Eth2.0 blockchains.\nWe show that all properties hold for FileCoin. However, given any Eth2.0\nnetwork (of any topology and size) with any number of potentially misbehaving\npeers, we can synthesize attacks where these peers are able to continuously\nmisbehave by never forwarding topic messages, while maintaining positive scores\nso that they are never pruned from the network by GossipSub.",

To tackle this problem, we\npropose to construct NN controllers by introducing encoder-decoder structured\nNNs with an attention mechanism. The encoder takes an STL formula as input and\nencodes it into an appropriate vector, and the decoder outputs control signals\nthat will meet the given specification. As the encoder, we consider three NN\nstructures: sequential, tree-structured, and graph-structured NNs. All the\nmodel parameters are trained in an end-to-end manner to maximize the expected\nrobustness that is known to be a quantitative semantics of STL formulae. We\ncompare the control performances attained by the above NN structures through a\nnumerical experiment of the path planning problem, showing the efficacy of the\nproposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Due to the importance of Android app quality assurance, many automated GUI\ntesting tools have been developed. Although the test algorithms have been\nimproved, the impact of GUI rendering has been overlooked. On the one hand,\nsetting a long waiting time to execute events on fully rendered GUIs slows down\nthe testing process. On the other hand, setting a short waiting time will cause\nthe events to execute on partially rendered GUIs, which negatively affects the\ntesting effectiveness. An optimal waiting time should strike a balance between\neffectiveness and efficiency. We propose AdaT, a lightweight image-based\napproach to dynamically adjust the inter-event time based on GUI rendering\nstate. Given the real-time streaming on the GUI, AdaT presents a deep learning\nmodel to infer the rendering state, and synchronizes with the testing tool to\nschedule the next event when the GUI is fully rendered.

    "title": "Information-Preserved Blending Method for Forward-Looking Sonar  Mosaicing in Non-Ideal System Configuration",
    "abstract": "Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS) has started to gain attention in the field of\nnear-bottom close-range underwater inspection because of its high resolution\nand high framerate features. Although Automatic Target Recognition (ATR)\nalgorithms have been applied tentatively for object-searching tasks, human\nsupervision is still indispensable, especially when involving critical areas. A\nclear FLS mosaic containing all suspicious information is in demand to help\nexperts deal with tremendous perception data. However, previous work only\nconsidered that FLS is working in an ideal system configuration, which assumes\nan appropriate sonar imaging setup and the availability of accurate positioning\ndata. Without those promises, the intra-frame and inter-frame artifacts will\nappear and degrade the quality of the final mosaic by making the information of\ninterest invisible. In this paper, we propose a novel blending method for FLS\nmosaicing which can preserve interested information. A Long-Short Time Sliding\nWindow (LST-SW) is designed to rectify the local statistics of raw sonar\nimages. The statistics are then utilized to construct a Global Variance Map\n(GVM). The GVM helps to emphasize the useful information contained in images in\nthe blending phase by classifying the informative and featureless pixels,\nthereby enhancing the quality of final mosaic. The method is verified using\ndata collected in the real environment. The results show that our method can\npreserve more details in FLS mosaics for human inspection purposes in practice.",

    "abstract": "An optimistic rollup (ORU) enables refereed delegation of computation from a\nblockchain (L1) to an untrusted remote system (L2), by allowing state updates\nposted on-chain to be disputed by any party via an interactive fraud proof\n(IFP) protocol. Existing systems that utilize this technique have demonstrated\nup to a 20x reduction in transaction fees. The most popular ORUs today, in\nactive development, strive to extend existing Ethereum client software to\nsupport IFP construction, aiming to reuse prior L1 engineering efforts and\nreplicate Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) semantics at L2. Unfortunately, to do\nso they tightly couple their on-chain IFP verifier with a specific client\nprogram binary--oblivious to its higher-level semantics. We argue that this\napproach (1) precludes the trust-minimized, permissionless participation of\nmultiple Ethereum client programs, magnifying monoculture failure risk; (2)\nleads to an unnecessarily large and complex trusted computing base that is\ndifficult to independently audit; and, (3) suffers from a frequently-triggered,\nyet opaque upgrade process--both further increasing auditing overhead and\ncomplicating on-chain access control. In this work, we aim to build a secure,\ntrust-minimized ORU that addresses these problems, while preserving scalability\nand dispute resolution efficiency. To do so, we design an IFP system native to\nthe EVM, that enforces Ethereum's specified semantics precisely at the level of\na single EVM instruction.

Existing solutions\ntypically suffer from poor generalization performance to new settings, largely\ndue to the limited diversity of image-mesh pairs in multi-view training data.\nTo address this shortcoming, people have explored the use of synthetic images.\nBut besides the usual impact of visual gap between rendered and target data,\nsynthetic-data-driven multi-view estimators also suffer from overfitting to the\ncamera viewpoint distribution sampled during training which usually differs\nfrom real-world distributions. Tackling both challenges, we propose a novel\nsimulation-based training pipeline for multi-view human mesh recovery, which\n(a) relies on intermediate 2D representations which are more robust to\nsynthetic-to-real domain gap; (b) leverages learnable calibration and\ntriangulation to adapt to more diversified camera setups; and (c) progressively\naggregates multi-view information in a canonical 3D space to remove ambiguities\nin 2D representations.

However, the training of NeuS takes an extremely long time (8 hours),\nwhich makes it almost impossible to apply them to dynamic scenes with thousands\nof frames. We propose a fast neural surface reconstruction approach, called\nNeuS2, which achieves two orders of magnitude improvement in terms of\nacceleration without compromising reconstruction quality. To accelerate the\ntraining process, we integrate multi-resolution hash encodings into a neural\nsurface representation and implement our whole algorithm in CUDA. We also\npresent a lightweight calculation of second-order derivatives tailored to our\nnetworks (i.e., ReLU-based MLPs), which achieves a factor two speed up. To\nfurther stabilize training, a progressive learning strategy is proposed to\noptimize multi-resolution hash encodings from coarse to fine. In addition, we\nextend our method for reconstructing dynamic scenes with an incremental\ntraining strategy. Our experiments on various datasets demonstrate that NeuS2\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in both surface reconstruction\naccuracy and training speed.

    "abstract": "We revisit the domain of off-policy policy optimization in RL from the\nperspective of coordinate ascent. One commonly-used approach is to leverage the\noff-policy policy gradient to optimize a surrogate objective -- the total\ndiscounted in expectation return of the target policy with respect to the state\ndistribution of the behavior policy. However, this approach has been shown to\nsuffer from the distribution mismatch issue, and therefore significant efforts\nare needed for correcting this mismatch either via state distribution\ncorrection or a counterfactual method. In this paper, we rethink off-policy\nlearning via Coordinate Ascent Policy Optimization (CAPO), an off-policy\nactor-critic algorithm that decouples policy improvement from the state\ndistribution of the behavior policy without using the policy gradient. This\ndesign obviates the need for distribution correction or importance sampling in\nthe policy improvement step of off-policy policy gradient. We establish the\nglobal convergence of CAPO with general coordinate selection and then further\nquantify the convergence rates of several instances of CAPO with popular\ncoordinate selection rules, including the cyclic and the randomized variants of\nCAPO. We then extend CAPO to neural policies for a more practical\nimplementation. Through experiments, we demonstrate that CAPO provides a\ncompetitive approach to RL in practice.",

    "abstract": "Graph processing applications are severely bottlenecked by memory system\nperformance due to low data reuse and irregular memory accesses. While\nstate-of-the-art prefetchers using Machine Learning (ML) have made great\nprogress, they do not perform well on graph analytics applications due to phase\ntransitions in the execution and irregular data access that is hard to predict.\nWe propose MPGraph: a novel ML-based Prefetcher for Graph analytics. MPGraph\nmakes three novel optimizations based on domain knowledge of graph analytics.\nIt detects the transition of graph processing phases during execution using a\nnovel soft detection technique, predicts memory accesses and pages using\nphase-specific multi-modality predictors, and prefetches using a novel chain\nspatio-temporal prefetching strategy. We evaluate our approach using three\nwidely-used graph processing frameworks and a variety of graph datasets. Our\napproach achieves 34.17%-82.15% higher precision in phase transition detection\nthan the KSWIN and decision tree baselines. Our predictors achieve 6.80%-16.02%\nhigher F1-score for access prediction and 11.68%-15.41% higher accuracy-at-10\nfor page prediction compared with the baselines LSTM-based and vanilla\nattention-based models. Simulations show that MPGraph achieves on the average\n87.16% (prefetch accuracy) and 73.29% (prefetch coverage), leading to\n12.52%-21.23% IPC improvement. It outperforms the widely-used non-ML prefetcher\nBO by 7.58%-12.03%, and outperforms state-of-the-art ML-based prefetchers\nVoyager by 3.27%-4.42% and TransFetch by 3.73%-4.58% with respect to IPC\nimprovement.",

    "abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the core techniques in AI\nsoftware. As AI is being applied to more and more domains, how to efficiently\ndevelop high-quality domain-specific language models becomes a critical\nquestion in AI software engineering. Existing domain-specific language model\ndevelopment processes mostly focus on learning a domain-specific pre-trained\nlanguage model (PLM); when training the domain task-specific language model\nbased on PLM, only a direct (and often unsatisfactory) fine-tuning strategy is\nadopted commonly. By enhancing the task-specific training procedure with domain\nknowledge graphs, we propose KnowledgeDA, a unified and low-code domain\nlanguage model development service. Given domain-specific task texts input by a\nuser, KnowledgeDA can automatically generate a domain-specific language model\nfollowing three steps: (i) localize domain knowledge entities in texts via an\nembedding-similarity approach; (ii) generate augmented samples by retrieving\nreplaceable domain entity pairs from two views of both knowledge graph and\ntraining data; (iii) select high-quality augmented samples for fine-tuning via\nconfidence-based assessment. We implement a prototype of KnowledgeDA to learn\nlanguage models for two domains, healthcare and software development.\nExperiments on five domain-specific NLP tasks verify the effectiveness and\ngeneralizability of KnowledgeDA.

    "abstract": "Graph analysts cannot directly obtain the global structure in decentralized\nsocial networks, and analyzing such a network requires collecting local views\nof the social graph from individual users. Since the edges between users may\nreveal sensitive social interactions in the local view, applying differential\nprivacy in the data collection process is often desirable, which provides\nstrong and rigorous privacy guarantees. In practical decentralized social\ngraphs, different edges have different privacy requirements due to the distinct\nsensitivity levels. However, the existing differentially private analysis of\nsocial graphs provide the same protection for all edges. To address this issue,\nthis work proposes a fine-grained privacy notion as well as novel algorithms\nfor private graph analysis. We first design a fine-grained relationship\ndifferential privacy (FGR-DP) notion for social graph analysis, which enforces\ndifferent protections for the edges with distinct privacy requirements. Then,\nwe design algorithms for triangle counting and k-stars counting, respectively,\nwhich can accurately estimate subgraph counts given fine-grained protection for\nsocial edges. We also analyze upper bounds on the estimation error, including\nk-stars and triangle counts, and show their superior performance compared with\nthe state-of-the-arts. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on two real\nsocial graph datasets and demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms satisfying\nFGR-DP have better utility than the state-of-the-art mechanisms due to the\nfiner-grained protection.",

It has been established that circular aperture\nprobes could conceivably provide higher image fidelity compared to rectangular\naperture probes used conventionally for near-field imaging.

The imaging capability of the\nproposed probe is analyzed using 3D electromagnetic simulation, and its\nperformance is validated experimentally. The efficacy of the proposed probe for\nhigh-resolution imaging is demonstrated by practical imaging dielectric and\nmetallic samples.

    "abstract": "The Position Embedding (PE) is critical for Vision Transformers (VTs) due to\nthe permutation-invariance of self-attention operation. By analyzing the input\nand output of each encoder layer in VTs using reparameterization and\nvisualization, we find that the default PE joining method (simply adding the PE\nand patch embedding together) operates the same affine transformation to token\nembedding and PE, which limits the expressiveness of PE and hence constrains\nthe performance of VTs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a simple,\neffective, and robust method. Specifically, we provide two independent layer\nnormalizations for token embeddings and PE for each layer, and add them\ntogether as the input of each layer's Muti-Head Self-Attention module. Since\nthe method allows the model to adaptively adjust the information of PE for\ndifferent layers, we name it as Layer-adaptive Position Embedding, abbreviated\nas LaPE. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaPE can improve various VTs\nwith different types of PE and make VTs robust to PE types. For example, LaPE\nimproves 0.94% accuracy for ViT-Lite on Cifar10, 0.98% for CCT on Cifar100, and\n1.72% for DeiT on ImageNet-1K, which is remarkable considering the negligible\nextra parameters, memory and computational cost brought by LaPE.

    "abstract": "LiDAR-based 3D Object detectors have achieved impressive performances in many\nbenchmarks, however, multisensors fusion-based techniques are promising to\nfurther improve the results. PointPainting, as a recently proposed framework,\ncan add the semantic information from the 2D image into the 3D LiDAR point by\nthe painting operation to boost the detection performance. However, due to the\nlimited resolution of 2D feature maps, severe boundary-blurring effect happens\nduring re-projection of 2D semantic segmentation into the 3D point clouds. To\nwell handle this limitation, a general multimodal fusion framework MSF has been\nproposed to fuse the semantic information from both the 2D image and 3D points\nscene parsing results. Specifically, MSF includes three main modules. First,\nSOTA off-the-shelf 2D/3D semantic segmentation approaches are employed to\ngenerate the parsing results for 2D images and 3D point clouds. The 2D semantic\ninformation is further re-projected into the 3D point clouds with calibrated\nparameters. To handle the misalignment between the 2D and 3D parsing results,\nan AAF module is proposed to fuse them by learning an adaptive fusion score.\nThen the point cloud with the fused semantic label is sent to the following 3D\nobject detectors. Furthermore, we propose a DFF module to aggregate deep\nfeatures in different levels to boost the final detection performance. The\neffectiveness of the framework has been verified on two public large-scale 3D\nobject detection benchmarks by comparing with different baselines. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed fusion strategies can significantly\nimprove the detection performance compared to the methods using only point\nclouds and the methods using only 2D semantic information. Most importantly,\nthe proposed approach significantly outperforms other approaches and sets new\nSOTA results on the nuScenes testing benchmark.",

    "abstract": "A key component of fact verification is thevevidence retrieval, often from\nmultiple documents. Recent approaches use dense representations and condition\nthe retrieval of each document on the previously retrieved ones. The latter\nstep is performed over all the documents in the collection, requiring storing\ntheir dense representations in an index, thus incurring a high memory\nfootprint. An alternative paradigm is retrieve-and-rerank, where documents are\nretrieved using methods such as BM25, their sentences are reranked, and further\ndocuments are retrieved conditioned on these sentences, reducing the memory\nrequirements. However, such approaches can be brittle as they rely on\nheuristics and assume hyperlinks between documents. We propose a novel\nretrieve-and-rerank method for multi-hop retrieval, that consists of a\nretriever that jointly scores documents in the knowledge source and sentences\nfrom previously retrieved documents using an autoregressive formulation and is\nguided by a proof system based on natural logic that dynamically terminates the\nretrieval process if the evidence is deemed sufficient.

The proposed waveform codec can be optimized flexibly\ntowards arbitrary rate, and the other appealing feature is that it can be\neasily optimized for any differentiable loss function, including perceptual\nloss used in semantic communications. To further improve the fidelity, we\nincorporate residual coding to mitigate the degradation arising from\nquantization distortion at the latent space. Results indicate that achieving\nthe same performance, the proposed method saves up to 27% coding rate than\nwidely used adaptive multi-rate wideband (AMR-WB) codec as well as emerging\nneural waveform coding methods.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enable agents to learn complex tasks.\nHowever, it is difficult to interpret the knowledge and reuse it across tasks.\nInductive biases can address such issues by explicitly providing generic yet\nuseful decomposition that is otherwise difficult or expensive to learn\nimplicitly. For example, object-centered approaches decompose a high\ndimensional observation into individual objects. Expanding on this, we utilize\nan inductive bias for explicit object-centered knowledge separation that\nprovides further decomposition into semantic representations and dynamics\nknowledge. For this, we introduce a semantic module that predicts an objects'\nsemantic state based on its context. The resulting affordance-like object state\ncan then be used to enrich perceptual object representations. With a minimal\nsetup and an environment that enables puzzle-like tasks, we demonstrate the\nfeasibility and benefits of this approach. Specifically, we compare three\ndifferent methods of integrating semantic representations into a model-based RL\narchitecture. Our experiments show that the degree of explicitness in knowledge\nseparation correlates with faster learning, better accuracy, better\ngeneralization, and better interpretability.",

    "abstract": "According to the software engineering community, the acknowledgement is\ngrowing that a theory of software development is needed to integrate the\ncurrently myriad popular methodologies, some of which are based on opposing\nperspectives. Conceptual modeling (CM) can contribute to such a theory. CM\ndefines fundamental concepts to create representations of reality to achieve\nontologically sound software behavior that is characterized by truthfulness to\nreality and conceptual clarity. In this context, CM is founded on theories\nabout the world that serve to represent a given domain. Ontologies have made\ntheir way into CM as tools in requirements analysis, implementation\nspecification, and software architecture. This paper involves building a direct\nconnection between reality and CM by establishing mapping between reality and\nmodeling thinging machines (TMs). Specifically, Stoic ontology serves to define\nthe existence of TM things and actions in reality. Such a development would\nbenefit CM in addition to demonstrating that classical concepts in philosophy\ncan be applied to modern fields of study. The TM model includes static and\ndynamic specifications. The dynamic level involves time-based events that can\nbe mapped to reality. The problem concerns the nature of a time-less static\ndescription, which provides regions where the actions in events take place;\nwithout them, the dynamic description collapses. The Stoics came up with a\nbrilliant move: the assumed reality to be a broader category than being.\nReality is made of things that exist and things that subsist. In this case, the\ndynamic TM description is in existence, whereas the static, mapped portion of\nthe dynamic description is in subsistence. We apply such ontology to a contract\nworkflow example. The result seems to open a new avenue of CM that may enhance\nthe theoretical foundation for software and system development.",

    "abstract": "Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a fundamental problem in computer vision\nwith numerous applications. Recently, LIDAR-supervised methods have achieved\nremarkable per-pixel depth accuracy in outdoor scenes. However, significant\nerrors are typically found in the proximity of depth discontinuities, i.e.,\ndepth edges, which often hinder the performance of depth-dependent applications\nthat are sensitive to such inaccuracies, e.g., novel view synthesis and\naugmented reality. Since direct supervision for the location of depth edges is\ntypically unavailable in sparse LIDAR-based scenes, encouraging the MDE model\nto produce correct depth edges is not straightforward. In this work we propose\nto learn to detect the location of depth edges from densely-supervised\nsynthetic data, and use it to generate supervision for the depth edges in the\nMDE training. %Despite the 'domain gap' between synthetic and real data, we\nshow that depth edges that are estimated directly are significantly more\naccurate than the ones that emerge indirectly from the MDE training. To\nquantitatively evaluate our approach, and due to the lack of depth edges ground\ntruth in LIDAR-based scenes, we manually annotated subsets of the KITTI and the\nDDAD datasets with depth edges ground truth.

    "abstract": "Common measures of brain functional connectivity (FC) including covariance\nand correlation matrices are semi-positive definite (SPD) matrices residing on\na cone-shape Riemannian manifold. Despite its remarkable success for\nEuclidean-valued data generation, use of standard generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs) to generate manifold-valued FC data neglects its inherent SPD\nstructure and hence the inter-relatedness of edges in real FC. We propose a\nnovel graph-regularized manifold-aware conditional Wasserstein GAN (GR-SPD-GAN)\nfor FC data generation on the SPD manifold that can preserve the global FC\nstructure. Specifically, we optimize a generalized Wasserstein distance between\nthe real and generated SPD data under an adversarial training, conditioned on\nthe class labels. The resulting generator can synthesize new SPD-valued FC\nmatrices associated with different classes of brain networks, e.g., brain\ndisorder or healthy control. Furthermore, we introduce additional population\ngraph-based regularization terms on both the SPD manifold and its tangent space\nto encourage the generator to respect the inter-subject similarity of FC\npatterns in the real data. This also helps in avoiding mode collapse and\nproduces more stable GAN training. Evaluated on resting-state functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of major depressive disorder (MDD),\nqualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed GR-SPD-GAN clearly\noutperforms several state-of-the-art GANs in generating more realistic\nfMRI-based FC samples.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the number of parameters of one deep learning (DL) model has\nbeen growing much faster than the growth of GPU memory space. People who are\ninaccessible to a large number of GPUs resort to heterogeneous training systems\nfor storing model parameters in CPU memory. Existing heterogeneous systems are\nbased on parallelization plans in the scope of the whole model. They apply a\nconsistent parallel training method for all the operators in the computation.\nTherefore, engineers need to pay a huge effort to incorporate a new type of\nmodel parallelism and patch its compatibility with other parallelisms. For\nexample, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is still incompatible with ZeRO-3 in\nDeepspeed. Also, current systems face efficiency problems on small scale, since\nthey are designed and tuned for large-scale training. In this paper, we propose\nElixir, a new parallel heterogeneous training system, which is designed for\nefficiency and flexibility. Elixir utilizes memory resources and computing\nresources of both GPU and CPU. For flexibility, Elixir generates\nparallelization plans in the granularity of operators. Any new type of model\nparallelism can be incorporated by assigning a parallel pattern to the\noperator. For efficiency, Elixir implements a hierarchical distributed memory\nmanagement scheme to accelerate inter-GPU communications and CPU-GPU data\ntransmissions. As a result, Elixir can train a 30B OPT model on an A100 with\n40GB CUDA memory, meanwhile reaching 84% efficiency of Pytorch GPU training.\nWith its super-linear scalability, the training efficiency becomes the same as\nPytorch GPU training on multiple GPUs. Also, large MoE models can be trained\n5.3x faster than dense models of the same size. Now Elixir is integrated into\nColossalAI and is available on its main branch.",

    "abstract": "DNN workloads can be scheduled onto DNN accelerators in many different ways:\nfrom layer-by-layer scheduling to cross-layer depth-first scheduling (a.k.a.\nlayer fusion, or cascaded execution). This results in a very broad scheduling\nspace, with each schedule leading to varying hardware (HW) costs in terms of\nenergy and latency. To rapidly explore this vast space for a wide variety of\nhardware architectures, analytical cost models are crucial to estimate\nscheduling effects on the HW level. However, state-of-the-art cost models are\nlacking support for exploring the complete depth-first scheduling space, for\ninstance focusing only on activations while ignoring weights, or modeling only\nDRAM accesses while overlooking on-chip data movements. These limitations\nprevent researchers from systematically and accurately understanding the\ndepth-first scheduling space.\nAfter formalizing this design space, this work proposes a unified modeling\nframework, DeFiNES, for layer-by-layer and depth-first scheduling to fill in\nthe gaps. DeFiNES enables analytically estimating the hardware cost for\npossible schedules in terms of both energy and latency, while considering data\naccess at every memory level. This is done for each schedule and HW\narchitecture under study by optimally choosing the active part of the memory\nhierarchy per unique combination of operand, layer, and feature map tile. The\nhardware costs are estimated, taking into account both data computation and\ndata copy phases. The analytical cost model is validated against measured data\nfrom a taped-out depth-first DNN accelerator, DepFiN, showing good modeling\naccuracy at the end-to-end neural network level. A comparison with generalized\nstate-of-the-art demonstrates up to 10X better solutions found with DeFiNES.",

    "abstract": "Depth cues are known to be useful for visual perception. However, direct\nmeasurement of depth is often impracticable. Fortunately, though, modern\nlearning-based methods offer promising depth maps by inference in the wild. In\nthis work, we adapt such depth inference models for object segmentation using\nthe objects' ``pop-out'' prior in 3D. The ``pop-out'' is a simple composition\nprior that assumes objects reside on the background surface. Such compositional\nprior allows us to reason about objects in the 3D space. More specifically, we\nadapt the inferred depth maps such that objects can be localized using only 3D\ninformation. Such separation, however, requires knowledge about contact surface\nwhich we learn using the weak supervision of the segmentation mask. Our\nintermediate representation of contact surface, and thereby reasoning about\nobjects purely in 3D, allows us to better transfer the depth knowledge into\nsemantics. The proposed adaptation method uses only the depth model without\nneeding the source data used for training, making the learning process\nefficient and practical.

    "abstract": "One of the main limitations of the commonly used Absolute Trajectory Error\n(ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence\nof just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the\ninlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we\npropose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the\nreconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error\n(DTE), is computed in four steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated\ntrajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the\norigin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of\ngeodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the\nestimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their\ngeometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute the\ndistances between the corresponding cameras, and obtain the DTE by taking the\naverage of the mean and root-mean-square (RMS) distance. This metric is an\nattractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the\nvarying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of\noutliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error\nmetric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to\nthe DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating\nthe camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our\nmetrics.

    "abstract": "Although machine learning based algorithms have been extensively used for\ndetecting phishing websites, there has been relatively little work on how\nadversaries may attack such \"phishing detectors\" (PDs for short). In this\npaper, we propose a set of Gray-Box attacks on PDs that an adversary may use\nwhich vary depending on the knowledge that he has about the PD. We show that\nthese attacks severely degrade the effectiveness of several existing PDs. We\nthen propose the concept of operation chains that iteratively map an original\nset of features to a new set of features and develop the \"Protective Operation\nChain\" (POC for short) algorithm. POC leverages the combination of random\nfeature selection and feature mappings in order to increase the attacker's\nuncertainty about the target PD. Using 3 existing publicly available datasets\nplus a fourth that we have created and will release upon the publication of\nthis paper, we show that POC is more robust to these attacks than past\ncompeting work, while preserving predictive performance when no adversarial\nattacks are present. Moreover, POC is robust to attacks on 13 different\nclassifiers, not just one. These results are shown to be statistically\nsignificant at the p < 0.001 level.",

The trained DGNs align the\ndistribution of adversarial samples with clean ones for the target DNNs by\ntranslating pixel values.

    "abstract": "Federated recommendation (FedRec) can train personalized recommenders without\ncollecting user data, but the decentralized nature makes it susceptible to\npoisoning attacks. Most previous studies focus on the targeted attack to\npromote certain items, while the untargeted attack that aims to degrade the\noverall performance of the FedRec system remains less explored. In fact,\nuntargeted attacks can disrupt the user experience and bring severe financial\nloss to the service provider. However, existing untargeted attack methods are\neither inapplicable or ineffective against FedRec systems. In this paper, we\ndelve into the untargeted attack and its defense for FedRec systems. (i) We\npropose ClusterAttack, a novel untargeted attack method. It uploads poisonous\ngradients that converge the item embeddings into several dense clusters, which\nmake the recommender generate similar scores for these items in the same\ncluster and perturb the ranking order. (ii) We propose a uniformity-based\ndefense mechanism (UNION) to protect FedRec systems from such attacks. We\ndesign a contrastive learning task that regularizes the item embeddings toward\na uniform distribution. Then the server filters out these malicious gradients\nby estimating the uniformity of updated item embeddings. Experiments on two\npublic datasets show that ClusterAttack can effectively degrade the performance\nof FedRec systems while circumventing many defense methods, and UNION can\nimprove the resistance of the system against various untargeted attacks,\nincluding our ClusterAttack.",

To gain a\nbetter understanding of the limitations and potential risks, this paper\npresents the first study on the robustness of diffusion models against backdoor\nattacks. Specifically, we propose BadDiffusion, a novel attack framework that\nengineers compromised diffusion processes during model training for backdoor\nimplantation. At the inference stage, the backdoored diffusion model will\nbehave just like an untampered generator for regular data inputs, while falsely\ngenerating some targeted outcome designed by the bad actor upon receiving the\nimplanted trigger signal. Such a critical risk can be dreadful for downstream\ntasks and applications built upon the problematic model. Our extensive\nexperiments on various backdoor attack settings show that BadDiffusion can\nconsistently lead to compromised diffusion models with high utility and target\nspecificity. Even worse, BadDiffusion can be made cost-effective by simply\nfinetuning a clean pre-trained diffusion model to implant backdoors. We also\nexplore some possible countermeasures for risk mitigation.

While data-driven learning is shown\nto be effective in various applications, learning from less data still remains\nchallenging. To address this challenge, existing approaches consider various\ndata augmentation techniques for increasing the number of training samples.\nPseudo-labeling is commonly used in a few-shot setup, where approximate labels\nare estimated for a large set of unlabeled images. We propose DiffAlign which\nfocuses on generating images from class labels. Specifically, we leverage the\nrecent success of the generative models (e.g., DALL-E and diffusion models)\nthat can generate realistic images from texts. However, naive learning on\nsynthetic images is not adequate due to the domain gap between real and\nsynthetic images. Thus, we employ a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss to\nalign the synthetic images to the real images minimizing the domain gap. We\nevaluate our method on the standard few-shot classification benchmarks:\nCIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet, tieredImageNet and a cross-domain few-shot\nclassification benchmark: miniImageNet to CUB.

Whilst funding is essential for some types of research and\nbeneficial for others, it may also constrain academic choice and creativity.\nThus, it is important to assess whether it is ever detrimental or unnecessary.\nHere we investigate whether funded research tends to be higher quality in all\nfields and for all major research funders. Based on peer review quality scores\nfor 113,877 articles from all fields in the UK's Research Excellence Framework\n(REF) 2021, we estimate that there are substantial disciplinary differences in\nthe proportion of funded journal articles, from Theology and Religious Studies\n(16%+) to Biological Sciences (91%+). The results suggest that funded research\nis likely to be higher quality overall, for all the largest research funders,\nand for all fields, even after factoring out research team size. There are\ndifferences between funders in the average quality of the research they\nsupport, however. Funding seems particularly beneficial in health-related\nfields. The results do not show cause and effect and do not take into account\nthe amount of funding received but are consistent with funding either improving\nresearch quality or being won by high quality researchers or projects. In\nsummary, there are no broad fields of research in which funding is irrelevant,\nso no fields can afford to ignore it. The results also show that citations are\nnot effective proxies for research quality in the arts and humanities and most\nsocial sciences for evaluating research funding.",

    "abstract": "The Journal Impact Factor and other indicators that assess the average\ncitation rate of articles in a journal are consulted by many academics and\nresearch evaluators, despite initiatives against overreliance on them. Despite\nthis, there is limited evidence about the extent to which journal impact\nindicators in any field relates to human judgements about the journals or their\narticles. In response, we compared average citation rates of journals against\nexpert judgements of their articles in all fields of science. We used\npreliminary quality scores for 96,031 articles published 2014-18 from the UK\nResearch Excellence Framework (REF) 2021. We show that whilst there is a\npositive correlation between expert judgements of article quality and average\njournal impact in all fields of science, it is very weak in many fields and is\nnever strong. The strength of the correlation varies from 0.11 to 0.43 for the\n27 broad fields of Scopus. The highest correlation for the 94 Scopus narrow\nfields with at least 750 articles was only 0.54, for Infectious Diseases, and\nthere was only one negative correlation, for the mixed category Computer\nScience (all). The results suggest that the average citation impact of a\nScopus-indexed journal is never completely irrelevant to the quality of an\narticle, even though it is never a strong indicator of article quality.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Scholars often aim to conduct high quality research and their\nsuccess is judged primarily by peer reviewers. Research quality is difficult\nfor either group to identify, however, and misunderstandings can reduce the\nefficiency of the scientific enterprise. In response, we use a novel term\nassociation strategy to seek quantitative evidence of aspects of research that\nassociate with high or low quality. Design/methodology/approach: We extracted\nthe words and 2-5-word phrases most strongly associating with different quality\nscores in each of 34 Units of Assessment (UoAs) in the Research Excellence\nFramework (REF) 2021. We extracted the terms from 122,331 journal articles\n2014-2020 with individual REF2021 quality scores. Findings: The terms\nassociating with high- or low-quality scores vary between fields but relate to\nwriting styles, methods, and topics. We show that the first-person writing\nstyle strongly associates with higher quality research in many areas because it\nis the norm for a set of large prestigious journals. We found methods and\ntopics that associate with both high- and low-quality scores. Worryingly, terms\nassociating with educational and qualitative research attract lower quality\nscores in multiple areas. REF experts may rarely give high scores to\nqualitative or educational research because the authors tend to be less\ncompetent, because it is harder to make world leading research with these\nthemes, or because they do not value them. Originality: This is the first\ninvestigation of journal article terms associating with research quality.",

    "abstract": "Existing natural language understanding (NLU) models often rely on dataset\nbiases rather than intended task-relevant features to achieve high performance\non specific datasets. As a result, these models perform poorly on datasets\noutside the training distribution. Some recent studies address the above issue\nby reducing the weights of biased samples during the training process. However,\nthese methods still encode biased latent features in representations and\nneglect the dynamic nature of bias, which hinders model prediction. We propose\nan NLU debiasing method, named debiasing contrastive learning (DCT), to\nsimultaneously alleviate the above problems based on contrastive learning. We\ndevise a debiasing positive sampling strategy to mitigate biased latent\nfeatures by selecting the least similar biased positive samples. We also\npropose a dynamic negative sampling strategy to capture the dynamic influence\nof biases by employing a bias-only model to dynamically select the most similar\nbiased negative samples. We conduct experiments on three NLU benchmark\ndatasets. Experimental results show that DCT outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines on out-of-distribution datasets while maintaining in-distribution\nperformance.

This method gives the student the best\nassistance in making up for his (or her) weaknesses and becoming a good one\noverall. Enlightened by this, we introduce the approach to the knowledge\ndistillation framework and propose a data-based distillation method named\n``Teaching what you Should Teach (TST)''. To be specific, TST contains a neural\nnetwork-based data augmentation module with the priori bias, which can assist\nin finding what the teacher is good at while the student are not by learning\nmagnitudes and probabilities to generate suitable samples. By training the data\naugmentation module and the generalized distillation paradigm in turn, a\nstudent model that has excellent generalization ability can be created. To\nverify the effectiveness of TST, we conducted extensive comparative experiments\non object recognition (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k), detection (MS-COCO), and\nsegmentation (Cityscapes) tasks. As experimentally demonstrated, TST achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on almost all teacher-student pairs. Furthermore,\nwe conduct intriguing studies of TST, including how to solve the performance\ndegradation caused by the stronger teacher and what magnitudes and\nprobabilities are needed for the distillation framework.",

Despite its merits, MLaaS\nposes significant concerns regarding the integrity of delegated computation and\nthe privacy of the server's model parameters. To address this issue, Zhang et\nal.

Few\nzkML schemes have been proposed afterward; however, they focus on sole ML\nclassification algorithms that may not offer satisfactory accuracy or require\nlarge-scale training data and model parameters, which may not be desirable for\nsome applications. We propose ezDPS, a new efficient and zero-knowledge ML\ninference scheme. Unlike prior works, ezDPS is a zkML pipeline in which the\ndata is processed in multiple stages for high accuracy. Each stage of ezDPS is\nharnessed with an established ML algorithm that is shown to be effective in\nvarious applications, including Discrete Wavelet Transformation, Principal\nComponents Analysis, and Support Vector Machine. We design new gadgets to prove\nML operations effectively. We fully implemented ezDPS and assessed its\nperformance on real datasets.

    "abstract": "In 1992 Bir\\'{o}, Hujter and Tuza introduced, for every fixed connected graph\n$H$, the class of $H$-graphs, defined as the intersection graphs of connected\nsubgraphs of some subdivision of $H$. Recently, quite a lot of research has\nbeen devoted to understanding the tractability border for various computational\nproblems, such as recognition or isomorphism testing, in classes of $H$-graphs\nfor different graphs $H$. In this work we undertake this research topic,\nfocusing on the recognition problem. Chaplick, T\\\"{o}pfer, Voborn\\'{\\i}k, and\nZeman showed, for every fixed tree $T$, a polynomial-time algorithm recognizing\n$T$-graphs. Tucker showed a polynomial time algorithm recognizing $K_3$-graphs\n(circular-arc graphs). On the other hand, Chaplick at al. showed that\nrecognition of $H$-graphs is $NP$-hard if $H$ contains two different cycles\nsharing an edge.\nThe main two results of this work narrow the gap between the $NP$-hard and\n$P$ cases of $H$-graphs recognition. First, we show that recognition of\n$H$-graphs is $NP$-hard when $H$ contains two different cycles. On the other\nhand, we show a polynomial-time algorithm recognizing $L$-graphs, where $L$ is\na graph containing a cycle and an edge attached to it ($L$-graphs are called\nlollipop graphs). Our work leaves open the recognition problems of $M$-graphs\nfor every unicyclic graph $M$ different from a cycle and a lollipop. Other\nresults of this work, which shed some light on the cases that remain open, are\nas follows. Firstly, the recognition of $M$-graphs, where $M$ is a fixed\nunicyclic graph, admits a polynomial time algorithm if we restrict the input to\ngraphs containing particular holes (hence recognition of $M$-graphs is probably\nmost difficult for chordal graphs). Secondly, the recognition of medusa graphs,\nwhich are defined as the union of $M$-graphs, where $M$ runs over all unicyclic\ngraphs, is $NP$-complete.",

The conventional wisdom has been\nthat detecting otoacoustic emissions, which are the faint sounds generated by\nthe cochlea, requires sensitive and expensive acoustic hardware. Thus, medical\ndevices for hearing screening cost thousands of dollars and are inaccessible in\nlow and middle income countries. We show that by designing wireless earbuds\nusing low-cost acoustic hardware and combining them with wireless sensing\nalgorithms, we can reliably identify otoacoustic emissions and perform hearing\nscreening. Our algorithms combine frequency modulated chirps with wideband\npulses emitted from a low-cost speaker to reliably separate otoacoustic\nemissions from in-ear reflections and echoes. We conducted a clinical study\nwith 50 ears across two healthcare sites. Our study shows that the low-cost\nearbuds detect hearing loss with 100% sensitivity and 89.7% specificity, which\nis comparable to the performance of a $8000 medical device.

Surface\ntemperatures of the garment can be controlled independently, quickly (within 20\nseconds), precisely (within 1 degC) and easily (through a tablet) up to 45\ndegC. Participants were instructed to adjust surface temperatures of each\nsegment to their preferences, with their physiological, psychological and\nadjustment data collected. We found that active heating could significantly and\nstably improve thermal satisfaction, the overall TSV and TCV had been improved\n1.50 and 1.53 during the self-adjustment phase. Preferred heating surface\ntemperatures for different segments varied widely. Further, even for the same\nsegment, individual differences among participants were considerable. Such\nvariances were observed through local heating powers, while unnoticeable among\nthermal perception votes. In other words, all these various differences could\nbe neutralized given the flexibility in personalized adjustments.

    "title": "On the Fair Termination of Client-Server Sessions",
    "abstract": "Client-server sessions are based on a variation of the traditional\ninterpretation of linear logic propositions as session types in which\nnon-linear channels (those regulating the interaction between a pool of clients\nand a single server) are typed by coexponentials instead of the usual\nexponentials. Coexponentials enable the modeling of racing interactions,\nwhereby clients compete to interact with a single server whose internal state\n(and thus the offered service) may change as the server processes requests\nsequentially. In this work we present a fair termination result for\nCSLL$^\\infty$, a core calculus of client-server sessions. We design a type\nsystem such that every well-typed term corresponds to a valid derivation in\n$\\mu$MALL$^\\infty$, the infinitary proof theory of linear logic with least and\ngreatest fixed points. We then establish a correspondence between reductions in\nthe calculus and principal reductions in $\\mu$MALL$^\\infty$. Fair termination\nin CSLL$^\\infty$ follows from cut elimination in $\\mu$MALL$^\\infty$.",

    "abstract": "Facial Expression Recognition (FER) in the wild is an extremely challenging\ntask. Recently, some Vision Transformers (ViT) have been explored for FER, but\nmost of them perform inferiorly compared to Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN). This is mainly because the new proposed modules are difficult to\nconverge well from scratch due to lacking inductive bias and easy to focus on\nthe occlusion and noisy areas. TransFER, a representative transformer-based\nmethod for FER, alleviates this with multi-branch attention dropping but brings\nexcessive computations. On the contrary, we present two attentive pooling (AP)\nmodules to pool noisy features directly. The AP modules include Attentive Patch\nPooling (APP) and Attentive Token Pooling (ATP). They aim to guide the model to\nemphasize the most discriminative features while reducing the impacts of less\nrelevant features. The proposed APP is employed to select the most informative\npatches on CNN features, and ATP discards unimportant tokens in ViT. Being\nsimple to implement and without learnable parameters, the APP and ATP\nintuitively reduce the computational cost while boosting the performance by\nONLY pursuing the most discriminative features. Qualitative results demonstrate\nthe motivations and effectiveness of our attentive poolings. Besides,\nquantitative results on six in-the-wild datasets outperform other\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Model checking has become a key tool for gaining confidence in correctness of\nmulti-threaded programs. Unit tests and functional tests do not suffice because\nof race conditions that are not discovered by those tests. McMini is an\nextensible model checker based on DPOR (Dynamic Partial Order Reduction). A\nmechanism was invented to declare to McMini new, primitive thread operations,\ntypically in 100~lines or less of C~code. The mechanism was extended to also\nallow the end user to declare alternative thread wakeup policies, including\nspurious wakeups from condition variables. One declares: (I) under what\nconditions an operation is enabled; (ii) which thread operations are\nindependent of each other; and (iii) when two operations can be considered as\nco-enabled. An optional wakeup policy is implemented by defining when a wait\noperation (on a semaphore, condition variable, etc.) is enabled. A new enqueue\nthread operation is described, allowing a user to declare alternative wakeup\npolicies. McMini was first confirmed to operate correctly and efficiently as a\ntraditional, but extensible model checker for mutex, semaphore, condition\nvariable, and reader-writer. McMini's extensibility was then tested on novel\nprimitive operations, representing other useful paradigms for multithreaded\noperations. An example is readers-and-two-writers. The speed of model checking\nwas found to be five times faster and more, as compared to traditional\nimplementations on top of condition variables. Alternative wakeup policies\n(e.g., FIFO, LIFO, arbitrary, etc.) were then tested using an enqueue\noperation. Finally, spurious wakeups were tested with a program that exposes a\nbug only in the presence of a spurious wakeup.",

    "title": "Transmit power policies for stochastic stabilisation of multi-link  wireless networked control systems",
    "abstract": "Transmit power control is one of the most important issues in wireless\nnetworks, where nodes typically operate on limited battery power. Reducing\ncommunicating power consumption is essential for both economic and ecologic\nreasons. In fact, transmitting at unnecessarily high power not only reduces\nnode lifetime, but also introduces excessive interference and electromagnetic\npollution. Existing work in the wireless community mostly focus on designing\ntransmit power policies by taking into account communication aspects like\nquality of service or network capacity. Wireless networked control systems\n(WNCSs), on the other hand, have different and specific needs such as\nstability, which require transmit power policies adapted to the control\ncontext. Transmit power design in the control community has recently attracted\nmuch attention, and available works mostly consider linear systems or specific\nclasses of non-linear systems with a single-link view of the system. In this\npaper, we propose a framework for the design of stabilising transmit power\nlevels that applies to much larger classes of non-linear plants, controllers,\nand multi-link setting. By exploiting the fact that channel success\nprobabilities are related to transmit power in a non-linear fashion, we first\nderive closed-loop stability conditions that relate channel probabilities with\ntransmission rate. Next, we combine these results together with well-known and\nrealistic interference models to provide a design methodology for stabilising\ntransmit power in non-linear and multi-link WNCSs.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the self-supervised pre-training paradigm has shown great potential\nin leveraging large-scale unlabeled data to improve downstream task\nperformance. However, increasing the scale of unlabeled pre-training data in\nreal-world scenarios requires prohibitive computational costs and faces the\nchallenge of uncurated samples. To address these issues, we build a\ntask-specific self-supervised pre-training framework from a data selection\nperspective based on a simple hypothesis that pre-training on the unlabeled\nsamples with similar distribution to the target task can bring substantial\nperformance gains. Buttressed by the hypothesis, we propose the first yet novel\nframework for Scalable and Efficient visual Pre-Training (SEPT) by introducing\na retrieval pipeline for data selection. SEPT first leverage a self-supervised\npre-trained model to extract the features of the entire unlabeled dataset for\nretrieval pipeline initialization. Then, for a specific target task, SEPT\nretrievals the most similar samples from the unlabeled dataset based on feature\nsimilarity for each target instance for pre-training. Finally, SEPT pre-trains\nthe target model with the selected unlabeled samples in a self-supervised\nmanner for target data finetuning. By decoupling the scale of pre-training and\navailable upstream data for a target task, SEPT achieves high scalability of\nthe upstream dataset and high efficiency of pre-training, resulting in high\nmodel architecture flexibility. Results on various downstream tasks demonstrate\nthat SEPT can achieve competitive or even better performance compared with\nImageNet pre-training while reducing the size of training samples by one\nmagnitude without resorting to any extra annotations.",

We present here an extension of the hybrid\nhigh-order method to meshes possessing curved edges/faces. Such an extension\nallows us to enforce boundary conditions exactly on curved domains, and capture\ncurved geometries that appear internally in the domain e.g. discontinuities in\na diffusion coefficient. The method makes use of non-polynomial functions on\nthe curved faces and does not require any mappings between reference\nelements/faces. Such an approach does not require the faces to be polynomial,\nand has a strict upper bound on the number of degrees of freedom on a curved\nface for a given polynomial degree. Moreover, this approach of enriching the\nspace of unknowns on the curved faces with non-polynomial functions should\nextend naturally to other polytopal methods. We show the method to be stable\nand consistent on curved meshes and derive optimal error estimates in L2 and\nenergy norms. We present numerical examples of the method on a domain with\ncurved boundary, and for a diffusion problem such that the diffusion tensor is\ndiscontinuous along a curved arc.",

    "abstract": "GNSS and LiDAR odometry are complementary as they provide absolute and\nrelative positioning, respectively. Their integration in a loosely-coupled\nmanner is straightforward but is challenged in urban canyons due to the GNSS\nsignal reflections. Recent proposed 3D LiDAR-aided (3DLA) GNSS methods employ\nthe point cloud map to identify the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception of GNSS\nsignals. This facilitates the GNSS receiver to obtain improved urban\npositioning but not achieve a sub-meter level. GNSS real-time kinematics (RTK)\nuses carrier phase measurements to obtain decimeter-level positioning. In urban\nareas, the GNSS RTK is not only challenged by multipath and NLOS-affected\nmeasurement but also suffers from signal blockage by the building. The latter\nwill impose a challenge in solving the ambiguity within the carrier phase\nmeasurements. In the other words, the model observability of the ambiguity\nresolution (AR) is greatly decreased. This paper proposes to generate virtual\nsatellite (VS) measurements using the selected LiDAR landmarks from the\naccumulated 3D point cloud maps (PCM). These LiDAR-PCM-made VS measurements are\ntightly-coupled with GNSS pseudorange and carrier phase measurements. Thus, the\nVS measurements can provide complementary constraints, meaning providing\nlow-elevation-angle measurements in the across-street directions. The\nimplementation is done using factor graph optimization to solve an accurate\nfloat solution of the ambiguity before it is fed into LAMBDA. The effectiveness\nof the proposed method has been validated by the evaluation conducted on our\nrecently open-sourced challenging dataset, UrbanNav. The result shows the fix\nrate of the proposed 3DLA GNSS RTK is about 30% while the conventional GNSS-RTK\nonly achieves about 14%. In addition, the proposed method achieves sub-meter\npositioning accuracy in most of the data collected in challenging urban areas.",

Previously, anomaly detection was mostly conducted using\ntraditional shallow learning techniques, but with little improvement.

Compared with existing attack\ndetection methods, the attack detection scheduling strategy in this paper only\nneeds to detect half of the neighbor node information to ensure the security of\nthe node local state estimation. We first formulate the problem of selecting\nthe sensor to be detected as a combinatorial optimization problem, which is\nNondeterminism Polynomial hard (NP-hard). To solve the above problem, we\nconvert the objective function into a submodular function. Then, we propose an\nattack detection scheduling algorithm based on sequential submodular\nmaximization, which incorporates expert problem to better cope with dynamic\nattack strategies. The proposed algorithm can run in polynomial time with a\ntheoretical lower bound on the optimization rate. In addition, the proposed\nalgorithm can guarantee the security of the whole network under two kinds of\ninsecurity conditions from the perspective of the augmented estimation error.\nFinally, a numerical simulation of the industrial continuous stirred tank\nreactor verifies the effectiveness of the developed approach.",

Estimator is established on a developed\nCNN-TCN architecture, which is capable of leveraging the spatial and temporal\nhidden features of trajectories to achieve high effectiveness and efficiency.\nEstimator partitions the entire traffic space into disjointed spatial regions\naccording to traffic conditions, which enhances the scalability significantly\nand thus enables parallel transportation classification. Extensive experiments\nusing eight public real-life datasets offer evidence that Estimator i) achieves\nsuperior model effectiveness (i.e., 99% Accuracy and 0.98 F1-score), which\noutperforms state-of-the-arts substantially; ii) exhibits prominent model\nefficiency, and obtains 7-40x speedups up over state-of-the-arts learning-based\nmethods; and iii) shows high model scalability and robustness that enables\nlarge-scale classification analytics.",

    "abstract": "Although recent deep learning methods, especially generative models, have\nshown good performance in fast magnetic resonance imaging, there is still much\nroom for improvement in high-dimensional generation. Considering that internal\ndimensions in score-based generative models have a critical impact on\nestimating the gradient of the data distribution, we present a new idea,\nlow-rank tensor assisted k-space generative model (LR-KGM), for parallel\nimaging reconstruction. This means that we transform original prior information\ninto high-dimensional prior information for learning. More specifically, the\nmulti-channel data is constructed into a large Hankel matrix and the matrix is\nsubsequently folded into tensor for prior learning. In the testing phase, the\nlow-rank rotation strategy is utilized to impose low-rank constraints on tensor\noutput of the generative network. Furthermore, we alternately use traditional\ngenerative iterations and low-rank high-dimensional tensor iterations for\nreconstruction. Experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-arts\ndemonstrated that the proposed LR-KGM method achieved better performance.",

We propose\nFocal-PETR with instance-guided supervision and spatial alignment module to\nadaptively focus object queries on discriminative foreground regions.\nFocal-PETR additionally introduces a down-sampling strategy to reduce the\nconsumption of global attention. Due to the highly parallelized implementation\nand down-sampling strategy, our model, without depth supervision, achieves\nleading performance on the large-scale nuScenes benchmark and a superior speed\nof 30 FPS on a single RTX3090 GPU.

This is usually split into two sub-tasks:\ntext localization and optical character recognition (OCR). Most existing OCR\nmodels only focus on the cropped text instance images, which require the\nbounding box information provided by a text region detection model. Introducing\nan additional detector to identify the text instance images in advance is\ninefficient, however instance-level OCR models have very low accuracy when\nprocessing the whole image for the document-level OCR, such as receipt images\ncontaining multiple text lines arranged in various layouts. To this end, we\npropose a localization-free document-level OCR model for transcribing all the\ncharacters in a receipt image into an ordered sequence end-to-end.\nSpecifically, we finetune the pretrained Transformer-based instance-level model\nTrOCR with randomly cropped image chunks, and gradually increase the image\nchunk size to generalize the recognition ability from instance images to\nfull-page images. In our experiments on the SROIE receipt OCR dataset, the\nmodel finetuned with our strategy achieved 64.4 F1-score and a 22.8% character\nerror rates (CER) on the word-level and character-level metrics, respectively,\nwhich outperforms the baseline results with 48.5 F1-score and 50.6% CER.

    "abstract": "Cardinality estimation is one of the most fundamental and challenging\nproblems in query optimization. Neither classical nor learning-based methods\nyield satisfactory performance when estimating the cardinality of the join\nqueries. They either rely on simplified assumptions leading to ineffective\ncardinality estimates or build large models to understand the data\ndistributions, leading to long planning times and a lack of generalizability\nacross queries.\nIn this paper, we propose a new framework FactorJoin for estimating join\nqueries. FactorJoin combines the idea behind the classical join-histogram\nmethod to efficiently handle joins with the learning-based methods to\naccurately capture attribute correlation. Specifically, FactorJoin scans every\ntable in a DB and builds single-table conditional distributions during an\noffline preparation phase. When a join query comes, FactorJoin translates it\ninto a factor graph model over the learned distributions to effectively and\nefficiently estimate its cardinality.\nUnlike existing learning-based methods, FactorJoin does not need to\nde-normalize joins upfront or require executed query workloads to train the\nmodel. Since it only relies on single-table statistics, FactorJoin has small\nspace overhead and is extremely easy to train and maintain. In our evaluation,\nFactorJoin can produce more effective estimates than the previous\nstate-of-the-art learning-based methods, with 40x less estimation latency, 100x\nsmaller model size, and 100x faster training speed at comparable or better\naccuracy. In addition, FactorJoin can estimate 10,000 sub-plan queries within\none second to optimize the query plan, which is very close to the traditional\ncardinality estimators in commercial DBMS.",

    "abstract": "The General Associative Memory Model (GAMM) has a constant state-dependant\nenergy surface that leads the output dynamics to fixed points, retrieving\nsingle memories from a collection of memories that can be asynchronously\npreloaded. We introduce a new class of General Sequential Episodic Memory\nModels (GSEMM) that, in the adiabatic limit, exhibit temporally changing energy\nsurface, leading to a series of meta-stable states that are sequential episodic\nmemories. The dynamic energy surface is enabled by newly introduced asymmetric\nsynapses with signal propagation delays in the network's hidden layer. We study\nthe theoretical and empirical properties of two memory models from the GSEMM\nclass, differing in their activation functions. LISEM has non-linearities in\nthe feature layer, whereas DSEM has non-linearity in the hidden layer. In\nprinciple, DSEM has a storage capacity that grows exponentially with the number\nof neurons in the network. We introduce a learning rule for the synapses based\non the energy minimization principle and show it can learn single memories and\ntheir sequential relationships online. This rule is similar to the Hebbian\nlearning algorithm and Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), which describe\nconditions under which synapses between neurons change strength.

    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised learning (WSL) has been proposed to alleviate the conflict\nbetween data annotation cost and model performance through employing\nsparsely-grained (i.e., point-, box-, scribble-wise) supervision and has shown\npromising performance, particularly in the image segmentation field. However,\nit is still a very challenging problem due to the limited supervision,\nespecially when only a small number of labeled samples are available.\nAdditionally, almost all existing WSL segmentation methods are designed for\nstar-convex structures which are very different from curvilinear structures\nsuch as vessels and nerves. In this paper, we propose a novel sparsely\nannotated segmentation framework for curvilinear structures, named YoloCurvSeg,\nbased on image synthesis. A background generator delivers image backgrounds\nthat closely match real distributions through inpainting dilated skeletons. The\nextracted backgrounds are then combined with randomly emulated curves generated\nby a Space Colonization Algorithm-based foreground generator and through a\nmultilayer patch-wise contrastive learning synthesizer. In this way, a\nsynthetic dataset with both images and curve segmentation labels is obtained,\nat the cost of only one or a few noisy skeleton annotations. Finally, a\nsegmenter is trained with the generated dataset and possibly an unlabeled\ndataset. The proposed YoloCurvSeg is evaluated on four publicly available\ndatasets (OCTA500, CORN, DRIVE and CHASEDB1) and the results show that\nYoloCurvSeg outperforms state-of-the-art WSL segmentation methods by large\nmargins. With only one noisy skeleton annotation (respectively 0.14%, 0.02%,\n1.4%, and 0.65% of the full annotation), YoloCurvSeg achieves more than 97% of\nthe fully-supervised performance on each dataset.

Alternative to traditional numerical schemes,\nlearning-based solvers utilize the representation power of DNNs to approximate\nthe input-output relations in an automated manner. However, the lack of\nphysics-in-the-loop often makes it difficult to construct a neural network\nsolver that simultaneously achieves high accuracy, low computational burden,\nand interpretability. In this work, focusing on a class of evolutionary PDEs\ncharacterized by having decomposable operators, we show that the classical\n``operator splitting'' numerical scheme of solving these equations can be\nexploited to design neural network architectures. This gives rise to a\nlearning-based PDE solver, which we name Deep Operator-Splitting Network\n(DOSnet). Such non-black-box network design is constructed from the physical\nrules and operators governing the underlying dynamics contains learnable\nparameters, and is thus more flexible than the standard operator splitting\nscheme. Once trained, it enables the fast solution of the same type of PDEs. To\nvalidate the special structure inside DOSnet, we take the linear PDEs as the\nbenchmark and give the mathematical explanation for the weight behavior.\nFurthermore, to demonstrate the advantages of our new AI-enhanced PDE solver,\nwe train and validate it on several types of operator-decomposable differential\nequations. We also apply DOSnet to nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations (NLSE)\nwhich have important applications in the signal processing for modern optical\nfiber transmission systems, and experimental results show that our model has\nbetter accuracy and lower computational complexity than numerical schemes and\nthe baseline DNNs.",

Specifically, the\nparameters of a low-rank core projection tensor, used to transform neighborhood\nentities in the encoder, are shared across relations to benefit from multi-task\nlearning and incorporate relations information effectively.

We propose to code the geometry of a\ngiven point cloud by learning a neural volumetric field.

The network is shared among all the cubes in\na single frame or multiple frames, to exploit the spatial and temporal\nredundancy. The neural field representation of the point cloud includes the\nnetwork parameters and all the latent codes, which are generated by using\nback-propagation over the network parameters and its input.

In this work, we target a pragmatic but under-explored Generalized\nNovel Category Discovery (GNCD) setting. The GNCD setting aims to categorize\nunlabeled training data coming from known and novel classes by leveraging the\ninformation of partially labeled known classes.

Besides, we propose a contrastive affinity learning\nstage to calibrate semantic representations based on our iterative\nsemi-supervised affinity graph generation method for semantically-enhanced\nprompt supervision.

    "abstract": "Federated learning enables cooperative training among massively distributed\nclients by sharing their learned local model parameters. However, with\nincreasing model size, deploying federated learning requires a large\ncommunication bandwidth, which limits its deployment in wireless networks. To\naddress this bottleneck, we introduce a residual-based federated learning\nframework (ResFed), where residuals rather than model parameters are\ntransmitted in communication networks for training. In particular, we integrate\ntwo pairs of shared predictors for the model prediction in both\nserver-to-client and client-to-server communication. By employing a common\nprediction rule, both locally and globally updated models are always fully\nrecoverable in clients and the server. We highlight that the residuals only\nindicate the quasi-update of a model in a single inter-round, and hence contain\nmore dense information and have a lower entropy than the model, comparing to\nmodel weights and gradients. Based on this property, we further conduct lossy\ncompression of the residuals by sparsification and quantization and encode them\nfor efficient communication. The experimental evaluation shows that our ResFed\nneeds remarkably less communication costs and achieves better accuracy by\nleveraging less sensitive residuals, compared to standard federated learning.\nFor instance, to train a 4.08 MB CNN model on CIFAR-10 with 10 clients under\nnon-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) setting, our approach\nachieves a compression ratio over 700X in each communication round with minimum\nimpact on the accuracy.

To tackle such challenging\nlabel scarcity issues in the non-Euclidean graph domain, meta-learning has\nbecome a successful and predominant paradigm. More recently, inspired by the\ndevelopment of graph self-supervised learning, transferring pretrained node\nembeddings for few-shot node classification could be a promising alternative to\nmeta-learning but remains unexposed. In this work, we empirically demonstrate\nthe potential of an alternative framework, \\textit{Transductive Linear\nProbing}, that transfers pretrained node embeddings, which are learned from\ngraph contrastive learning methods. We further extend the setting of few-shot\nnode classification from standard fully supervised to a more realistic\nself-supervised setting, where meta-learning methods cannot be easily deployed\ndue to the shortage of supervision from training classes. Surprisingly, even\nwithout any ground-truth labels, transductive linear probing with\nself-supervised graph contrastive pretraining can outperform the\nstate-of-the-art fully supervised meta-learning based methods under the same\nprotocol. We hope this work can shed new light on few-shot node classification\nproblems and foster future research on learning from scarcely labeled instances\non graphs.",

    "abstract": "Source code segment authorship identification is the task of identifying the\nauthor of a source code segment through supervised learning. It has vast\nimportance in plagiarism detection, digital forensics, and several other law\nenforcement issues. However, when a source code segment is written by multiple\nauthors, typical author identification methods no longer work. Here, an author\nidentification technique, capable of predicting the authorship of source code\nsegments, even in the case of multiple authors, has been proposed which uses a\nstacking ensemble classifier. This proposed technique is built upon several\ndeep neural networks, random forests and support vector machine classifiers. It\nhas been shown that for identifying the author group, a single classification\ntechnique is no longer sufficient and using a deep neural network-based\nstacking ensemble method can enhance the accuracy significantly. The\nperformance of the proposed technique has been compared with some existing\nmethods which only deal with the source code segments written precisely by a\nsingle author. Despite the harder task of authorship identification for source\ncode segments written by multiple authors, our proposed technique has achieved\npromising results evidenced by the identification accuracy, compared to the\nrelated works which only deal with code segments written by a single author.",

These solutions often require specialized compilers that can insert\nmetadata (called tags) into the generated binaries, and/or extend the RISC-V\nISA with new instructions. Developing such compilers can be a tedious and\ntime-consuming process. In this paper, we present COGENT, a generic instruction\ntag generator for RISC-V architecture.

To explore the direct and perceived impact of operator\ninput on task success and team performance, 16 real-world missions (10 hrs)\nwere conducted based on the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. These missions were\nto deploy a heterogeneous team of robots for a search task to locate and\nidentify artifacts such as climbing rope, drills and mannequins representing\nhuman survivors. Two conditions were evaluated: human operators that could\ncontrol the robot team with state-of-the-art autonomy (Human-Robot Team)\ncompared to autonomous missions without human operator input (Robot-Autonomy).\nHuman-Robot Teams were often in directed autonomy mode (70% of mission time),\nfound more items, traversed more distance, covered more unique ground, and had\na higher time between safety-related events. Human-Robot Teams were faster at\nfinding the first artifact, but slower to respond to information from the robot\nteam. In routine conditions, scores were comparable for artifacts, distance,\nand coverage. Reasons for intervention included creating waypoints to\nprioritise high-yield areas, and to navigate through error-prone spaces. After\nobserving robot autonomy, operators reported increases in robot competency and\ntrust, but that robot behaviour was not always transparent and understandable,\neven after high mission performance.",

    "abstract": "An important challenge in vision-based action recognition is the embedding of\nspatiotemporal features with two or more heterogeneous modalities into a single\nfeature. In this study, we propose a new 3D deformable transformer for action\nrecognition with adaptive spatiotemporal receptive fields and a cross-modal\nlearning scheme. The 3D deformable transformer consists of three attention\nmodules: 3D deformability, local joint stride, and temporal stride attention.\nThe two cross-modal tokens are input into the 3D deformable attention module to\ncreate a cross-attention token with a reflected spatiotemporal correlation.\nLocal joint stride attention is applied to spatially combine attention and pose\ntokens. Temporal stride attention temporally reduces the number of input tokens\nin the attention module and supports temporal expression learning without the\nsimultaneous use of all tokens. The deformable transformer iterates L times and\ncombines the last cross-modal token for classification. The proposed 3D\ndeformable transformer was tested on the NTU60, NTU120, FineGYM, and Penn\nAction datasets, and showed results better than or similar to pre-trained\nstate-of-the-art methods even without a pre-training process.

    "abstract": "Online media data, in the forms of images and videos, are becoming mainstream\ncommunication channels. However, recent advances in deep learning, particularly\ndeep generative models, open the doors for producing perceptually convincing\nimages and videos at a low cost, which not only poses a serious threat to the\ntrustworthiness of digital information but also has severe societal\nimplications. This motivates a growing interest of research in media tampering\ndetection, i.e., using deep learning techniques to examine whether media data\nhave been maliciously manipulated. Depending on the content of the targeted\nimages, media forgery could be divided into image tampering and Deepfake\ntechniques. The former typically moves or erases the visual elements in\nordinary images, while the latter manipulates the expressions and even the\nidentity of human faces. Accordingly, the means of defense include image\ntampering detection and Deepfake detection, which share a wide variety of\nproperties. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the current\nmedia tampering detection approaches, and discuss the challenges and trends in\nthis field for future research.",

    "abstract": "In the setting of error-correcting codes with feedback, Alice wishes to\ncommunicate a $k$-bit message $x$ to Bob by sending a sequence of bits over a\nchannel while noiselessly receiving feedback from Bob. It has been long known\n(Berlekamp, 1964) that in this model, Bob can still correctly determine $x$\neven if $\\approx \\frac13$ of Alice's bits are flipped adversarially. This\nimproves upon the classical setting without feedback, where recovery is not\npossible for error fractions exceeding $\\frac14$.\nThe original feedback setting assumes that after transmitting each bit, Alice\nknows (via feedback) what bit Bob received. In this work, our focus in on the\nlimited feedback model, where Bob is only allowed to send a few bits at a small\nnumber of pre-designated points in the protocol. For any desired $\\epsilon >\n0$, we construct a coding scheme that tolerates a fraction $ 1/3-\\epsilon$ of\nbit flips relying only on $O_\\epsilon(\\log k)$ bits of feedback from Bob sent\nin a fixed $O_\\epsilon(1)$ number of rounds. We complement this with a matching\nlower bound showing that $\\Omega(\\log k)$ bits of feedback are necessary to\nrecover from an error fraction exceeding $1/4$ (the threshold without any\nfeedback), and for schemes resilient to a fraction $1/3-\\epsilon$ of bit flips,\nthe number of rounds must grow as $\\epsilon \\to 0$.\nWe also study (and resolve) the question for the simpler model of erasures.\nWe show that $O_\\epsilon(\\log k)$ bits of feedback spread over $O_\\epsilon(1)$\nrounds suffice to tolerate a fraction $(1-\\epsilon)$ of erasures. Likewise, our\n$\\Omega(\\log k)$ lower bound applies for erasure fractions exceeding $1/2$, and\nan increasing number of rounds are required as the erasure fraction approaches\n$1$.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) outperforms convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nin several vision tasks with its global modeling capabilities. However, ViT\nlacks the inductive bias inherent to convolution making it require a large\namount of data for training. This results in ViT not performing as well as CNNs\non small datasets like medicine and science. We experimentally found that\nmasked autoencoders (MAE) can make the transformer focus more on the image\nitself, thus alleviating the data-hungry issue of ViT to some extent. Yet the\ncurrent MAE model is too complex resulting in over-fitting problems on small\ndatasets. This leads to a gap between MAEs trained on small datasets and\nadvanced CNNs models still. Therefore, we investigated how to reduce the\ndecoder complexity in MAE and found a more suitable architectural configuration\nfor it with small datasets. Besides, we additionally designed a location\nprediction task and a contrastive learning task to introduce localization and\ninvariance characteristics for MAE. Our contrastive learning task not only\nenables the model to learn high-level visual information but also allows the\ntraining of MAE's class token. This is something that most MAE improvement\nefforts do not consider. Extensive experiments have shown that our method shows\nstate-of-the-art performance on standard small datasets as well as medical\ndatasets with few samples compared to the current popular masked image modeling\n(MIM) and vision transformers for small datasets.The code and models are\navailable at https://github.com/Talented-Q/SDMAE.",

    "abstract": "Point cloud registration (PCR) is a popular research topic in computer\nvision. Recently, the registration method in an evolutionary way has received\ncontinuous attention because of its robustness to the initial pose and\nflexibility in objective function design. However, most evolving registration\nmethods cannot tackle the local optimum well and they have rarely investigated\nthe success ratio, which implies the probability of not falling into local\noptima and is closely related to the practicality of the algorithm.\nEvolutionary multi-task optimization (EMTO) is a widely used paradigm, which\ncan boost exploration capability through knowledge transfer among related\ntasks. Inspired by this concept, this study proposes a novel evolving\nregistration algorithm via EMTO, where the multi-task configuration is based on\nthe idea of solution space cutting. Concretely, one task searching in cut space\nassists another task with complex function landscape in escaping from local\noptima and enhancing successful registration ratio. To reduce unnecessary\ncomputational cost, a sparse-to-dense strategy is proposed. In addition, a\nnovel fitness function robust to various overlap rates as well as a\nproblem-specific metric of computational cost is introduced. Compared with 7\nevolving registration approaches and 4 traditional registration approaches on\nthe object-scale and scene-scale registration datasets, experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method has superior performances in terms of\nprecision and tackling local optima.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are known to be susceptible to adversarial\nperturbation. One famous attack is the adversarial patch, a sticker with a\nparticularly crafted pattern that makes the model incorrectly predict the\nobject it is placed on. This attack presents a critical threat to\ncyber-physical systems that rely on cameras such as autonomous cars. Despite\nthe significance of the problem, conducting research in this setting has been\ndifficult; evaluating attacks and defenses in the real world is exceptionally\ncostly while synthetic data are unrealistic. In this work, we propose the REAP\n(REalistic Adversarial Patch) benchmark, a digital benchmark that allows the\nuser to evaluate patch attacks on real images, and under real-world conditions.\nBuilt on top of the Mapillary Vistas dataset, our benchmark contains over\n14,000 traffic signs. Each sign is augmented with a pair of geometric and\nlighting transformations, which can be used to apply a digitally generated\npatch realistically onto the sign. Using our benchmark, we perform the first\nlarge-scale assessments of adversarial patch attacks under realistic\nconditions. Our experiments suggest that adversarial patch attacks may present\na smaller threat than previously believed and that the success rate of an\nattack on simpler digital simulations is not predictive of its actual\neffectiveness in practice.

    "abstract": "In vibration energy harvesting technologies, feedback control is required to\nmaximize the average power generated from stochastic disturbances. In\nlarge-scale applications it is often advantageous to use three-phase conversion\ntechnologies for transduction. In such situations, vector control techniques\ncan be used to optimally control the transducer currents in the\ndirect-quadrature reference frame, as dynamic functions of feedback\nmeasurements. In this paradigm, converted energy is optimally controlled via\nthe quadrature current. The direct current is only used to maintain control of\nthe quadrature current when the machine's internal back-EMF exceeds the voltage\nof the power bus, a technique called field weakening. Due to increased\ndissipation in the stator coil, the use of field weakening results in a\nreduction in power conversion, relative to what would theoretically be possible\nwith a larger bus voltage. This over-voltage issue can be alternatively\naddressed by imposing a competing objective in the optimization of the\nquadrature current controller, such that the frequency and duration of these\nover-voltage events are reduced. However, this also results in reduced\ngenerated power, due to the need to satisfy the competing constraint. This\npaper examines the tradeoff between these two approaches to over-voltage\ncompensation, and illustrates a methodology for determining the optimum balance\nbetween the two approaches.",

    "abstract": "MPI is the de facto standard for parallel computation on a cluster of\ncomputers. Yet resilience for MPI continues to be an issue for large-scale\ncomputations, and especially for long-running computations that exceed the\nmaximum time allocated to a job by a resource manager. Transparent\ncheckpointing (with no modification of the underlying binary executable) is an\nimportant component in any strategy for software resilience and chaining of\nresource allocations. However, achieving low runtime overhead is critical for\ncommunity acceptance of a transparent checkpointing solution. (\"Runtime\noverhead\" is the overhead in time when running an application with no\ncheckpoints, both with and without the checkpointing package.)\nA collective-vector-clock algorithm for transparent checkpointing of MPI is\npresented. The algorithm is built using the software of the mature MANA project\nfor transparent checkpointing of MPI. MANA's existing two-phase-commit\nalgorithm produces very high runtime overhead as compared to \"native\"\nexecution. For example, MANA was found to result in runtime overheads as high\nas 37% on some real-world programs, and up to 800% on some typical\nmicro-benchmarks -- especially on workloads that intensively use collective\ncommunication. The new algorithm replaces two-phase commit. It is a novel\nvariation on vector clock algorithms. It uses a vector of logical clocks, with\nan individual clock for each distinct group of MPI processes underlying the MPI\ncommunicators in the application. This contrasts with the traditional vector of\nlogical clocks across individual processes. Micro-benchmarks show a runtime\noverhead of essentially zero for many MPI processes. And two real-world\napplications, VASP and GROMACS, show a runtime overhead ranging mostly from 0%\nto 7% (VASP) and 1% to 14% (GROMACS) -- even before further analysis and\noptimization of other sources of overhead.",

    "abstract": "The current LiDAR SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system suffers\ngreatly from low accuracy and limited robustness when faced with complicated\ncircumstances. From our experiments, we find that current LiDAR SLAM systems\nhave limited performance when the noise level in the obtained point clouds is\nlarge. Therefore, in this work, we propose a general framework to tackle the\nproblem of denoising and loop closure for LiDAR SLAM in complex environments\nwith many noises and outliers caused by reflective materials. Current\napproaches for point clouds denoising are mainly designed for small-scale point\nclouds and can not be extended to large-scale point clouds scenes. In this\nwork, we firstly proposed a lightweight network for large-scale point clouds\ndenoising. Subsequently, we have also designed an efficient loop closure\nnetwork for place recognition in global optimization to improve the\nlocalization accuracy of the whole system. Finally, we have demonstrated by\nextensive experiments and benchmark studies that our method can have a\nsignificant boost on the localization accuracy of the LiDAR SLAM system when\nfaced with noisy point clouds, with a marginal increase in computational cost.",

    "abstract": "In object detection, post-processing methods like Non-maximum Suppression\n(NMS) are widely used. NMS can substantially reduce the number of false\npositive detections but may still keep some detections with low objectness\nscores. In order to find the exact number of objects and their labels in the\nimage, we propose a post processing method called Detection Selection Algorithm\n(DSA) which is used after NMS or related methods. DSA greedily selects a subset\nof detected bounding boxes, together with full object reconstructions that give\nthe interpretation of the whole image with highest likelihood, taking into\naccount object occlusions. The algorithm consists of four components. First, we\nadd an occlusion branch to Faster R-CNN to obtain occlusion relationships\nbetween objects. Second, we develop a single reconstruction algorithm which can\nreconstruct the whole appearance of an object given its visible part, based on\nthe optimization of latent variables of a trained generative network which we\ncall the decoder. Third, we propose a whole reconstruction algorithm which\ngenerates the joint reconstruction of all objects in a hypothesized\ninterpretation, taking into account occlusion ordering. Finally we propose a\ngreedy algorithm that incrementally adds or removes detections from a list to\nmaximize the likelihood of the corresponding interpretation. DSA with NMS or\nSoft-NMS can achieve better results than NMS or Soft-NMS themselves, as is\nillustrated in our experiments on synthetic images with mutiple 3d objects.",

    "abstract": "Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs), such as social gathering\nrestrictions, have shown effectiveness to slow the transmission of COVID-19 by\nreducing the contact of people. To support policy-makers, multiple studies have\nfirst modeled human mobility via macro indicators (e.g., average daily travel\ndistance) and then studied the effectiveness of NPIs. In this work, we focus on\nmobility modeling and, from a micro perspective, aim to predict locations that\nwill be visited by COVID-19 cases. Since NPIs generally cause economic and\nsocietal loss, such a micro perspective prediction benefits governments when\nthey design and evaluate them. However, in real-world situations, strict\nprivacy data protection regulations result in severe data sparsity problems\n(i.e., limited case and location information). To address these challenges, we\nformulate the micro perspective mobility modeling into computing the relevance\nscore between a diffusion and a location, conditional on a geometric graph. we\npropose a model named Deep Graph Diffusion Infomax (DGDI), which jointly models\nvariables including a geometric graph, a set of diffusions and a set of\nlocations.To facilitate the research of COVID-19 prediction, we present two\nbenchmarks that contain geometric graphs and location histories of COVID-19\ncases.

    "abstract": "Developing robots that are capable of many skills and generalization to\nunseen scenarios requires progress on two fronts: efficient collection of large\nand diverse datasets, and training of high-capacity policies on the collected\ndata. While large datasets have propelled progress in other fields like\ncomputer vision and natural language processing, collecting data of comparable\nscale is particularly challenging for physical systems like robotics. In this\nwork, we propose a framework to bridge this gap and better scale up robot\nlearning, under the lens of multi-task, multi-scene robot manipulation in\nkitchen environments. Our framework, named CACTI, has four stages that\nseparately handle data collection, data augmentation, visual representation\nlearning, and imitation policy training. In the CACTI framework, we highlight\nthe benefit of adapting state-of-the-art models for image generation as part of\nthe augmentation stage, and the significant improvement of training efficiency\nby using pretrained out-of-domain visual representations at the compression\nstage. Experimentally, we demonstrate that 1) on a real robot setup, CACTI\nenables efficient training of a single policy capable of 10 manipulation tasks\ninvolving kitchen objects, and robust to varying layouts of distractor objects;\n2) in a simulated kitchen environment, CACTI trains a single policy on 18\nsemantic tasks across up to 50 layout variations per task.

This paper\nproposes a two-stage optimization model to jointly make decisions for two\ntasks. In the first stage, the timetable rescheduling problem with cancellation\nand short-turning strategies is formulated as a mixed integer linear\nprogramming (MILP). In particular, the instantaneous parameters and variables\nare used to describe the accumulation of time-varying passenger flow. In the\nsecond one, a system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment (SODTA) model is\nemployed to dynamically schedule response vehicles, which is able to capture\nthe dynamic traffic and congestion. Numerical cases of Beijing Metro Line 9\nverify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model, and results show\nthat: (1) when occurring a disruption event during peak hours, the impact on\nthe normal timetable is greater, and passengers in the direction with fewer\ntrain services are more affected; (2) if passengers stranded at the terminal\nstations of disruption area are not transported in time, they will rapidly\nincrease at a speed of more than 300 passengers per minute; (3) compared with\nthe fixed shortest path, using the response vehicles reduces the total travel\ntime about 7%.

    "abstract": "Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has found success in\noperations research and machine learning applications as a powerful means to\nobtain solutions with favourable out-of-sample performances. Two compelling\nexplanations for the success are the generalization bounds derived from\nWasserstein DRO and the equivalency between Wasserstein DRO and the\nregularization scheme commonly applied in machine learning. Existing results on\ngeneralization bounds and the equivalency to regularization are largely limited\nto the setting where the Wasserstein ball is of a certain type and the decision\ncriterion takes certain forms of an expected function. In this paper, we show\nthat by focusing on Wasserstein DRO problems with affine decision rules, it is\npossible to obtain generalization bounds and the equivalency to regularization\nin a significantly broader setting where the Wasserstein ball can be of a\ngeneral type and the decision criterion can be a general measure of risk, i.e.,\nnonlinear in distributions. This allows for accommodating many important\nclassification, regression, and risk minimization applications that have not\nbeen addressed to date using Wasserstein DRO. Our results are strong in that\nthe generalization bounds do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and\nthe equivalency to regularization is exact. As a byproduct, our regularization\nresults broaden considerably the class of Wasserstein DRO models that can be\nsolved efficiently via regularization formulations.",

In this paper, we propose a novel feature\nlearning method in the deep learning framework, referred to as Feature\nCalibration Network (FC-Net), to adaptively detect pedestrians under various\nocclusions. FC-Net is based on the observation that the visible parts of\npedestrians are selective and decisive for detection, and is implemented as a\nself-paced feature learning framework with a self-activation (SA) module and a\nfeature calibration (FC) module. In a new self-activated manner, FC-Net learns\nfeatures which highlight the visible parts and suppress the occluded parts of\npedestrians. The SA module estimates pedestrian activation maps by reusing\nclassifier weights, without any additional parameter involved, therefore\nresulting in an extremely parsimony model to reinforce the semantics of\nfeatures, while the FC module calibrates the convolutional features for\nadaptive pedestrian representation in both pixel-wise and region-based ways.\nExperiments on CityPersons and Caltech datasets demonstrate that FC-Net\nimproves detection performance on occluded pedestrians up to 10% while\nmaintaining excellent performance on non-occluded instances.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of a batch of linearly correlated image\nalignment, where the observed images are deformed by some unknown domain\ntransformations, and corrupted by additive Gaussian noise and sparse noise\nsimultaneously. By stacking these images as the frontal slices of a third-order\ntensor, we propose to utilize the tensor factorization method via transformed\ntensor-tensor product to explore the low-rankness of the underlying tensor,\nwhich is factorized into the product of two smaller tensors via transformed\ntensor-tensor product under any unitary transformation. The main advantage of\ntransformed tensor-tensor product is that its computational complexity is lower\ncompared with the existing literature based on transformed tensor nuclear norm.\nMoreover, the tensor $\\ell_p$ $(0<p<1)$ norm is employed to characterize the\nsparsity of sparse noise and the tensor Frobenius norm is adopted to model\nadditive Gaussian noise.

Specifically, a background classification sub-task is\ndecomposed from the density map prediction task, which is then assigned to a\nDensity Decoupling Module (DDM) to exploit its highly discriminative ability.\nFor the remaining foreground prediction sub-task, it is further hierarchically\ndecomposed to several density-specific sub-tasks by the DDM, which are then\nsolved by the regression-based experts in a Foreground Density Estimation\nModule (FDEM). Although the proposed strategy effectively reduces the\nhypothesis space so as to relieve the optimization for those task-specific\nexperts, the high correlation of these sub-tasks are ignored.

Further, to\nreduce the accuracy degradation, we propose adaptive low-precision training\n(ALPT) that learns the step size (i.e., the quantization resolution) through\ngradient descent. Experiments on two real-world datasets confirm our analysis\nand show that ALPT can significantly improve the prediction accuracy,\nespecially at extremely low bit widths. For the first time in CTR models, we\nsuccessfully train 8-bit embeddings without sacrificing prediction accuracy.\nThe code of ALPT is publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Identifiers, such as method and variable names, form a large portion of\nsource code. Therefore, low-quality identifiers can substantially hinder code\ncomprehension. To support developers in using meaningful identifiers, several\n(semi-)automatic techniques have been proposed, mostly being data-driven (e.g.\nstatistical language models, deep learning models) or relying on static code\nanalysis. Still, limited empirical investigations have been performed on the\neffectiveness of such techniques for recommending developers with meaningful\nidentifiers, possibly resulting in rename refactoring operations. We present a\nlarge-scale study investigating the potential of data-driven approaches to\nsupport automated variable renaming. We experiment with three state-of-the-art\ntechniques: a statistical language model and two DL-based models. The three\napproaches have been trained and tested on three datasets we built with the\ngoal of evaluating their ability to recommend meaningful variable identifiers.\nOur quantitative and qualitative analyses show the potential of such techniques\nthat, under specific conditions, can provide valuable recommendations and are\nready to be integrated in rename refactoring tools.

Several challenges with\nthis approach have been described in large organisations, but its application\nin smaller companies with early-stage products remains largely unexplored.\nAims: The goal of this study is to understand what factors could affect the\nadoption of CE in early-stage software startups. Method: We present a\ndescriptive multiple-case study of five startups in Finland which differ in\ntheir utilisation of experimentation. Results: We find that practices often\nmentioned as prerequisites for CE, such as iterative development and continuous\nintegration and delivery, were used in the case companies. CE was not widely\nrecognised or used as described in the literature. Only one company performed\nexperiments and used experimental data systematically. Conclusions: Our study\nindicates that small companies may be unlikely to adopt CE unless 1) at least\nsome company employees have prior experience with the practice, 2) the\ncompany's limited available resources are not exceeded by its adoption, and 3)\nthe practice solves a problem currently experienced by the company, or the\ncompany perceives almost immediate benefit of adopting it.

In recent years, state-of-the-art methods\nare dedicated to ``scale decoupling'' and ``semantic decoupling'' strategies to\nfurther enhance the capability of representation. However, these previous\napproaches focus on either the disentangling scale or semantics but ignore\nmerging these two ideas in a union model, which extremely limits the\nperformance of cross-modal retrieval models. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel Scale-Semantic Joint Decoupling Network (SSJDN) for remote\nsensing image-text retrieval. Specifically, we design the Bidirectional Scale\nDecoupling (BSD) module, which exploits Salience Feature Extraction (SFE) and\nSalience-Guided Suppression (SGS) units to adaptively extract potential\nfeatures and suppress cumbersome features at other scales in a bidirectional\npattern to yield different scale clues. Besides, we design the Label-supervised\nSemantic Decoupling (LSD) module by leveraging the category semantic labels as\nprior knowledge to supervise images and texts probing significant\nsemantic-related information. Finally, we design a Semantic-guided Triple Loss\n(STL), which adaptively generates a constant to adjust the loss function to\nimprove the probability of matching the same semantic image and text and\nshorten the convergence time of the retrieval model.

    "abstract": "Current outdoor LiDAR-based 3D object detection methods mainly adopt the\ntraining-from-scratch paradigm. Unfortunately, this paradigm heavily relies on\nlarge-scale labeled data, whose collection can be expensive and time-consuming.\nSelf-supervised pre-training is an effective and desirable way to alleviate\nthis dependence on extensive annotated data. Recently, masked modeling has\nbecome a successful self-supervised learning approach for point clouds.\nHowever, current works mainly focus on synthetic or indoor datasets. When\napplied to large-scale and sparse outdoor point clouds, they fail to yield\nsatisfactory results. In this work, we present BEV-MAE, a simple masked\nautoencoder pre-training framework for 3D object detection on outdoor point\nclouds. Specifically, we first propose a bird's eye view (BEV) guided masking\nstrategy to guide the 3D encoder learning feature representation in a BEV\nperspective and avoid complex decoder design during pre-training. Besides, we\nintroduce a learnable point token to maintain a consistent receptive field size\nof the 3D encoder with fine-tuning for masked point cloud inputs. Finally,\nbased on the property of outdoor point clouds, i.e., the point clouds of\ndistant objects are more sparse, we propose point density prediction to enable\nthe 3D encoder to learn location information, which is essential for object\ndetection. Experimental results show that BEV-MAE achieves new state-of-the-art\nself-supervised results on both Waymo and nuScenes with diverse 3D object\ndetectors. Furthermore, with only 20% data and 7% training cost during\npre-training, BEV-MAE achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art\nmethod ProposalContrast.

Using the device's real-time\noperational data collected by IIoT to get the estimated RUL through the RUL\nprediction algorithm, the PHM system can develop proactive maintenance measures\nfor the device, thus, reducing maintenance costs and decreasing failure times\nduring operation. This paper carries out research into the remaining useful\nlife prediction model for multi-sensor devices in the IIoT scenario. We\ninvestigated the mainstream RUL prediction models and summarized the basic\nsteps of RUL prediction modeling in this scenario. On this basis, a data-driven\napproach for RUL estimation is proposed in this paper. It employs a Multi-Head\nAttention Mechanism to fuse the multi-dimensional time-series data output from\nmultiple sensors, in which the attention on features is used to capture the\ninteractions between features and attention on sequences is used to learn the\nweights of time steps. Then, the Long Short-Term Memory Network is applied to\nlearn the features of time series. We evaluate the proposed model on two\nbenchmark datasets (C-MAPSS and PHM08), and the results demonstrate that it\noutperforms the state-of-art models. Moreover, through the interpretability of\nthe multi-head attention mechanism, the proposed model can provide a\npreliminary explanation of engine degradation. Therefore, this approach is\npromising for predictive maintenance in IIoT scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Black soldier fly (BSF) larvae (\\textit{Hermetia illucens}) are a valuable\nprotein source for manufacturing animal feed. To maximize their production,\nboth the quantity and quality of their reproductive cycle, i.e. egg production\nduring oviposition, must be increased. In artificial environments, flies often\nsit idle in cages without mating, depleting their energy reserves and resulting\nin lower egg production per female.\nBy controlling environmental conditions such as temperature and light inside\nbreeding cages, the flies may be stimulated in a way that improves egg output.\nHowever, this stimulation increases the energy demand of the process and may\nstress the flies, resulting in reduced egg production. Therefore, control must\nbe applied in a careful way, which requires knowledge of the egg production\ncycle.\nIn this work, a mathematical model describing the various fly life stages and\ntheir transition to the egg production process is developed. Relevant factors\nare identified and their effect on the fly life and egg production is\nmathematically described. Parameters are identified using data from literature\nand goodness of fit is evaluated. Using the model, an optimal control problem\nis formulated with the goal of minimizing the energy costs and increasing the\negg production quantity. In Simulation, our approach showed 13\\% higher output\nin shorter time at reduced energy costs compared to a (standard) constant\nsetpoint approach. Optimal control could reach same amount of egg in 60~\\% of\ntime compared to standard scenario.",

    "title": "Transfer Learning using Spectral Convolutional Autoencoders on  Semi-Regular Surface Meshes",
    "abstract": "The underlying dynamics and patterns of 3D surface meshes deforming over time\ncan be discovered by unsupervised learning, especially autoencoders, which\ncalculate low-dimensional embeddings of the surfaces. To study the deformation\npatterns of unseen shapes by transfer learning, we want to train an autoencoder\nthat can analyze new surface meshes without training a new network. Here, most\nstate-of-the-art autoencoders cannot handle meshes of different connectivity\nand therefore have limited to no generalization capacities to new meshes. Also,\nreconstruction errors strongly increase in comparison to the errors for the\ntraining shapes. To address this, we propose a novel spectral CoSMA\n(Convolutional Semi-Regular Mesh Autoencoder) network. This patch-based\napproach is combined with a surface-aware training. It reconstructs surfaces\nnot presented during training and generalizes the deformation behavior of the\nsurfaces' patches. The novel approach reconstructs unseen meshes from different\ndatasets in superior quality compared to state-of-the-art autoencoders that\nhave been trained on these shapes. Our transfer learning errors on unseen\nshapes are 40% lower than those from models learned directly on the data.\nFurthermore, baseline autoencoders detect deformation patterns of unseen mesh\nsequences only for the whole shape. In contrast, due to the employed regional\npatches and stable reconstruction quality, we can localize where on the\nsurfaces these deformation patterns manifest.",

    "abstract": "Scale-invariance is an open problem in many computer vision subfields. For\nexample, object labels should remain constant across scales, yet model\npredictions diverge in many cases. This problem gets harder for tasks where the\nground-truth labels change with the presentation scale. In image quality\nassessment (IQA), downsampling attenuates impairments, e.g., blurs or\ncompression artifacts, which can positively affect the impression evoked in\nsubjective studies. To accurately predict perceptual image quality,\ncross-resolution IQA methods must therefore account for resolution-dependent\nerrors induced by model inadequacies as well as for the perceptual label shifts\nin the ground truth. We present the first study of its kind that disentangles\nand examines the two issues separately via KonX, a novel, carefully crafted\ncross-resolution IQA database. This paper contributes the following: 1. Through\nKonX, we provide empirical evidence of label shifts caused by changes in the\npresentation resolution. 2. We show that objective IQA methods have a scale\nbias, which reduces their predictive performance. 3. We propose a multi-scale\nand multi-column DNN architecture that improves performance over previous\nstate-of-the-art IQA models for this task, including recent transformers. We\nthus both raise and address a novel research problem in image quality\nassessment.",

    "abstract": "The geographically weighted regression (GWR) is an essential tool for\nestimating the spatial variation of relationships between dependent and\nindependent variables in geographical contexts. However, GWR suffers from the\nproblem that classical linear regressions, which compose the GWR model, are\nmore prone to be underfitting, especially for significant volume and complex\nnonlinear data, causing inferior comparative performance. Nevertheless, some\nadvanced models, such as the decision tree and the support vector machine, can\nlearn features from complex data more effectively while they cannot provide\nexplainable quantification for the spatial variation of localized\nrelationships. To address the above issues, we propose a geographically\ngradient boosting weighted regression model, GWRBoost, that applies the\nlocalized additive model and gradient boosting optimization method to alleviate\nunderfitting problems and retains explainable quantification capability for\nspatially-varying relationships between geographically located variables.\nFurthermore, we formulate the computation method of the Akaike information\nscore for the proposed model to conduct the comparative analysis with the\nclassic GWR algorithm. Simulation experiments and the empirical case study are\napplied to prove the efficient performance and practical value of GWRBoost.

    "abstract": "Directly training a document-to-document (Doc2Doc) neural machine translation\n(NMT) via Transformer from scratch, especially on small datasets usually fails\nto converge. Our dedicated probing tasks show that 1) both the absolute\nposition and relative position information gets gradually weakened or even\nvanished once it reaches the upper encoder layers, and 2) the vanishing of\nabsolute position information in encoder output causes the training failure of\nDoc2Doc NMT. To alleviate this problem, we propose a position-aware Transformer\n(P-Transformer) to enhance both the absolute and relative position information\nin both self-attention and cross-attention. Specifically, we integrate absolute\npositional information, i.e., position embeddings, into the query-key pairs\nboth in self-attention and cross-attention through a simple yet effective\naddition operation. Moreover, we also integrate relative position encoding in\nself-attention. The proposed P-Transformer utilizes sinusoidal position\nencoding and does not require any task-specified position embedding, segment\nembedding, or attention mechanism. Through the above methods, we build a\nDoc2Doc NMT model with P-Transformer, which ingests the source document and\ncompletely generates the target document in a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq)\nway. In addition, P-Transformer can be applied to seq2seq-based\ndocument-to-sentence (Doc2Sent) and sentence-to-sentence (Sent2Sent)\ntranslation. Extensive experimental results of Doc2Doc NMT show that\nP-Transformer significantly outperforms strong baselines on widely-used 9\ndocument-level datasets in 7 language pairs, covering small-, middle-, and\nlarge-scales, and achieves a new state-of-the-art. Experimentation on discourse\nphenomena shows that our Doc2Doc NMT models improve the translation quality in\nboth BLEU and discourse coherence. We make our code available on Github.",

Therefore, we investigated optimization methods that lower detection\ntime and cost with minimal performance loss.

Methods: The Transformer-based model\nPLM-ICD achieved the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the ICD\ncoding benchmark dataset MIMIC-III. It was chosen as our baseline model to be\nfurther optimised. XR-Transformer, the new SOTA model in the general extreme\nmulti-label text classification domain, and XR-LAT, a novel adaptation of the\nXR-Transformer model, were also trained on the MIMIC-III dataset. XR-LAT is a\nrecursively trained model chain on a predefined hierarchical code tree with\nlabel-wise attention, knowledge transferring and dynamic negative sampling\nmechanisms. Results: Our optimised PLM-ICD model, which was trained with longer\ntotal and chunk sequence lengths, significantly outperformed the current SOTA\nPLM-ICD model, and achieved the highest micro-F1 score of 60.8%. The\nXR-Transformer model, although SOTA in the general domain, did not perform well\nacross all metrics. The best XR-LAT based model obtained results that were\ncompetitive with the current SOTA PLM-ICD model, including improving the\nmacro-AUC by 2.1%. Conclusion: Our optimised PLM-ICD model is the new SOTA\nmodel for automated ICD coding on the MIMIC-III dataset, while our novel XR-LAT\nmodel performs competitively with the previous SOTA PLM-ICD model.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary Virtual Reality (VR) setups often include an external source\ndelivering content to a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). \"Cutting the wire\" in such\nsetups and going truly wireless will require a wireless network capable of\ndelivering enormous amounts of video data at an extremely low latency. The\nmassive bandwidth of higher frequencies, such as the millimeter-wave (mmWave)\nband, can meet these requirements. Due to high attenuation and path loss in the\nmmWave frequencies, beamforming is essential. In wireless VR, where the antenna\nis integrated into the HMD, any head rotation also changes the antenna's\norientation. As such, beamforming must adapt, in real-time, to the user's head\nrotations. An HMD's built-in sensors providing accurate orientation estimates\nmay facilitate such rapid beamforming. In this work, we present coVRage, a\nreceive-side beamforming solution tailored for VR HMDs. Using built-in\norientation prediction present on modern HMDs, the algorithm estimates how the\nAngle of Arrival (AoA) at the HMD will change in the near future, and covers\nthis AoA trajectory with a dynamically shaped oblong beam, synthesized using\nsub-arrays. We show that this solution can cover these trajectories with\nconsistently high gain, even in light of temporally or spatially inaccurate\norientational data.",

    "title": "ALSO: Automotive Lidar Self-supervision by Occupancy estimation",
    "abstract": "We propose a new self-supervised method for pre-training the backbone of deep\nperception models operating on point clouds. The core idea is to train the\nmodel on a pretext task which is the reconstruction of the surface on which the\n3D points are sampled, and to use the underlying latent vectors as input to the\nperception head. The intuition is that if the network is able to reconstruct\nthe scene surface, given only sparse input points, then it probably also\ncaptures some fragments of semantic information, that can be used to boost an\nactual perception task. This principle has a very simple formulation, which\nmakes it both easy to implement and widely applicable to a large range of 3D\nsensors and deep networks performing semantic segmentation or object detection.\nIn fact, it supports a single-stream pipeline, as opposed to most contrastive\nlearning approaches, allowing training on limited resources. We conducted\nextensive experiments on various autonomous driving datasets, involving very\ndifferent kinds of lidars, for both semantic segmentation and object detection.\nThe results show the effectiveness of our method to learn useful\nrepresentations without any annotation, compared to existing approaches.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a couple of preconditioning techniques that can be used\nto enhance the performance of iterative regularization methods applied to image\ndeblurring problems with a variety of point spread functions (PSFs) and\nboundary conditions. More precisely, we first consider the anti-identity\npreconditioner, which symmetrizes the coefficient matrix associated to problems\nwith zero boundary conditions, allowing the use of MINRES as a regularization\nmethod. When considering more sophisticated boundary conditions and strongly\nnonsymmetric PSFs, the anti-identity preconditioner improves the performance of\nGMRES. We then consider both stationary and iteration-dependent regularizing\ncirculant preconditioners that, applied in connection with the anti-identity\nmatrix and both standard and flexible Krylov subspaces, speed up the\niterations. A theoretical result about the clustering of the eigenvalues of the\npreconditioned matrices is proved in a special case. The results of many\nnumerical experiments are reported to show the effectiveness of the new\npreconditioning techniques, including when considering the deblurring of sparse\nimages.",

    "abstract": "As the complexity of modern manufacturing technologies increases, traditional\ntrial-and-error design, which requires iterative and expensive simulations,\nbecomes unreliable and time-consuming. This difficulty is especially\nsignificant for the design of hot-stamped safety-critical components, such as\nultra-high-strength-steel (UHSS) B-pillars. To reduce design costs and ensure\nmanufacturability, scalar-based Artificial-Intelligence-empowered surrogate\nmodelling (SAISM) has been investigated and implemented, which can allow\nreal-time manufacturability-constrained structural design optimisation.\nHowever, SAISM suffers from low accuracy and generalisability, and usually\nrequires a high volume of training samples. To solve this problem, an\nimage-based Artificial-intelligence-empowered surrogate modelling (IAISM)\napproach is developed in this research, in combination with an\nauto-decoder-based blank shape generator. The IAISM, which is based on a\nMask-Res-SE-U-Net architecture, is trained to predict the full thinning field\nof the as-formed component given an arbitrary blank shape. Excellent prediction\nperformance of IAISM is achieved with only 256 training samples, which\nindicates the small-data learning nature of engineering AI tasks using\nstructured data representations. The trained auto-decoder, trained\nMask-Res-SE-U-Net, and Adam optimiser are integrated to conduct blank\noptimisation by modifying the latent vector. The optimiser can rapidly find\nblank shapes that satisfy manufacturability criteria. As a high-accuracy and\ngeneralisable surrogate modelling and optimisation tool, the proposed pipeline\nis promising to be integrated into a full-chain digital twin to conduct\nreal-time, multi-objective design optimisation.",

To solve this problem, few-shot font generation\nand even one-shot font generation have attracted a lot of attention. However,\nmost existing font generation methods may still suffer from (i) large\ncross-font gap challenge; (ii) subtle cross-font variation problem; and (iii)\nincorrect generation of complicated characters. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel one-shot font generation method based on a diffusion model, named\nDiff-Font, which can be stably trained on large datasets. The proposed model\naims to generate the entire font library by giving only one sample as the\nreference. Specifically, a large stroke-wise dataset is constructed, and a\nstroke-wise diffusion model is proposed to preserve the structure and the\ncompletion of each generated character. To our best knowledge, the proposed\nDiff-Font is the first work that developed diffusion models to handle the font\ngeneration task. The well-trained Diff-Font is not only robust to font gap and\nfont variation, but also achieved promising performance on difficult character\ngeneration.

However, most of these methods require linking a\npseudo-label to a ground-truth object by thresholding. In previous works, this\nthreshold value is usually determined empirically, which is time consuming, and\nonly done for a single data distribution. When the domain, and thus the data\ndistribution, changes, a new and costly parameter search is necessary. In this\nwork, we introduce our method Adaptive Self-Training for Object Detection\n(ASTOD), which is a simple yet effective teacher-student method. ASTOD\ndetermines without cost a threshold value based directly on the ground value of\nthe score histogram. To improve the quality of the teacher predictions, we also\npropose a novel pseudo-labeling procedure. We use different views of the\nunlabeled images during the pseudo-labeling step to reduce the number of missed\npredictions and thus obtain better candidate labels. Our teacher and our\nstudent are trained separately, and our method can be used in an iterative\nfashion by replacing the teacher by the student. On the MS-COCO dataset, our\nmethod consistently performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods that do\nnot require a threshold parameter, and shows competitive results with methods\nthat require a parameter sweep search. Additional experiments with respect to a\nsupervised baseline on the DIOR dataset containing satellite images lead to\nsimilar conclusions, and prove that it is possible to adapt the score threshold\nautomatically in self-training, regardless of the data distribution.",

In this\npaper, we present a new meta self-training pipeline, named SRoUDA, for\nimproving adversarial robustness of UDA models. Based on self-training\nparadigm, SRoUDA starts with pre-training a source model by applying UDA\nbaseline on source labeled data and taraget unlabeled data with a developed\nrandom masked augmentation (RMA), and then alternates between adversarial\ntarget model training on pseudo-labeled target data and finetuning source model\nby a meta step. While self-training allows the direct incorporation of AT in\nUDA, the meta step in SRoUDA further helps in mitigating error propagation from\nnoisy pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SRoUDA where it achieves\nsignificant model robustness improvement without harming clean accuracy.

    "abstract": "Software implements a significant proportion of functionality in factory\nautomation. Thus, efficient development and the reuse of software parts,\nso-called units, enhance competitiveness. Thereby, complex control software\nunits are more difficult to understand, leading to increased development,\ntesting and maintenance costs. However, measuring complexity is challenging due\nto many different, subjective views on the topic. This paper compares different\ncomplexity definitions from literature and considers with a qualitative\nquestionnaire study the complexity perception of domain experts, who confirm\nthe importance of objective measures to compare complexity. The paper proposes\na set of metrics that measure various classes of software complexity to\nidentify the most complex software units as a prerequisite for refactoring. The\nmetrics include complexity caused by size, data structure, control flow,\ninformation flow and lexical structure. Unlike most literature approaches, the\nmetrics are compliant with graphical and textual languages from the IEC 61131-3\nstandard. Further, a concept for interpreting the metric results is presented.\nA comprehensive evaluation with industrial software from two German plant\nmanufacturers validates the metrics' suitability to measure complexity.",

The key insight is that embodied agents can leverage\nlocation consistency as a supervision signal - collecting images from different\nviews/angles and applying contrastive learning to fine-tune a semantic\nsegmentation model.

However, in real scenarios documents are mostly composed\nof multiple pages that should be processed altogether. In this work we extend\nDocVQA to the multi-page scenario. For that, we first create a new dataset,\nMP-DocVQA, where questions are posed over multi-page documents instead of\nsingle pages. Second, we propose a new hierarchical method, Hi-VT5, based on\nthe T5 architecture, that overcomes the limitations of current methods to\nprocess long multi-page documents. The proposed method is based on a\nhierarchical transformer architecture where the encoder summarizes the most\nrelevant information of every page and then, the decoder takes this summarized\ninformation to generate the final answer. Through extensive experimentation, we\ndemonstrate that our method is able, in a single stage, to answer the questions\nand provide the page that contains the relevant information to find the answer,\nwhich can be used as a kind of explainability measure.",

    "abstract": "Digital twin has recently attracted growing attention, leading to intensive\nresearch and applications. Along with this, a new research area, dubbed as\n\"human digital twin\" (HDT), has emerged. Similar to the conception of digital\ntwin, HDT is referred to as the replica of a physical-world human in the\ndigital world. Nevertheless, HDT is much more complicated and delicate compared\nto digital twins of any physical systems and processes, due to humans' dynamic\nand evolutionary nature, including physical, behavioral, social, physiological,\npsychological, cognitive, and biological dimensions. Studies on HDT are\nlimited, and the research is still in its infancy. In this paper, we first\nexamine the inception, development, and application of the digital twin\nconcept, providing a context within which we formally define and characterize\nHDT based on the similarities and differences between digital twin and HDT.\nThen we conduct an extensive literature review on HDT research, analyzing\nunderpinning technologies and establishing typical frameworks in which the core\nHDT functions or components are organized. Built upon the findings from the\nabove work, we propose a generic architecture for the HDT system and describe\nthe core function blocks and corresponding technologies. Following this, we\npresent the state of the art of HDT technologies and applications in the\nhealthcare, industry, and daily life domain.

However, it has been\nrecently found that the interpretability of prototypes can be corrupted due to\nthe semantic gap between similarity in latent space and that in input space. In\nthis work, we make the first attempt to quantitatively evaluate the\ninterpretability of prototype-based explanations, rather than solely\nqualitative evaluations by some visualization examples, which can be easily\nmisled by cherry picks. To this end, we propose two evaluation metrics, termed\nconsistency score and stability score, to evaluate the explanation consistency\ncross images and the explanation robustness against perturbations, both of\nwhich are essential for explanations taken into practice. Furthermore, we\npropose a shallow-deep feature alignment (SDFA) module and a score aggregation\n(SA) module to improve the interpretability of prototypes. We conduct\nsystematical evaluation experiments and substantial discussions to uncover the\ninterpretability of existing ProtoPNets.

This is especially the case in large bandwidth terahertz\ncommunication systems, due to the sudden drop in energy-efficiency of ADCs as\nthe sampling rate is increased above 100MHz. Two mitigating energy-efficient\napproaches which have received significant recent interest are i) to reduce the\nnumber of ADCs via analog and hybrid beamforming architectures, and ii) to\nreduce the resolution of the ADCs which in turn decreases power consumption.\nHowever, decreasing the number and resolution of ADCs leads to performance loss\n-- in terms of achievable rates -- due to increased quantization error. In this\nwork, we study the application of practically implementable nonlinear analog\noperators such as envelop detectors and polynomial operators, prior to sampling\nand quantization at the ADCs, as a way to mitigate the aforementioned\nrate-loss. A receiver architecture consisting of linear analog combiners,\nnonlinear analog operators, and few-bit ADCs is designed.

However, the centralized control concept usually\napplied in aMFS hinders an easy adaptation, as the entire control software has\nto be re-tested, when manually changing sub-parts of the control. As adaption\nand subsequent testing are a time-consuming task, concepts for splitting the\ncontrol from one centralized to multiple, decentralized control nodes are\nrequired. Therefore, this paper presents a holistic agent-based control concept\nfor aMFS, whereby the system is divided into so-called automated material flow\nmodules (aMFM), each being controlled by a dedicated module agent. The concept\nallows the reconfiguration of aMFS, consisting of heterogeneous, stationary\naMFM, during runtime. Furthermore, it includes aspects such as uniform agent\nknowledge bases through metamodel-based development, a communication ontology\nconsidering different information types and properties, strategic route\noptimization in decentralized control architecture and a visualization concept\nto make decisions of the module agents comprehensible to operators and\nmaintenance staff.

    "title": "Industrially Applicable System Regression Test Prioritization in  Production Automation",
    "abstract": "When changes are performed on an automated production system (aPS), new\nfaults can be accidentally introduced in the system, which are called\nregressions. A common method for finding these faults is regression testing. In\nmost cases, this regression testing process is performed under high time\npressure and on-site in a very uncomfortable environment. Until now, there is\nno automated support for finding and prioritizing system test cases regarding\nthe fully integrated aPS that are suitable for finding regressions. Thus, the\ntesting technician has to rely on personal intuition and experience, possibly\nchoosing an inappropriate order of test cases, finding regressions at a very\nlate stage of the test run. Using a suitable prioritization, this iterative\nprocess of finding and fixing regressions can be streamlined and a lot of time\ncan be saved by executing test cases likely to identify new regressions\nearlier. Thus, an approach is presented in this paper that uses previously\nacquired runtime data from past test executions and performs a change\nidentification and impact analysis to prioritize test cases that have a high\nprobability to unveil regressions caused by side effects of a system change.\nThe approach was developed in cooperation with reputable industrial partners\nactive in the field of aPS engineering, ensuring a development in line with\nindustrial requirements. An industrial case study and an expert evaluation were\nperformed, showing promising results.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new data augmentation algorithm for natural\nunderstanding tasks, called RPN:Random Position Noise algorithm.Due to the\nrelative paucity of current text augmentation methods. Few of the extant\nmethods apply to natural language understanding tasks for all sentence-level\ntasks.RPN applies the traditional augmentation on the original text to the word\nvector level. The RPN algorithm makes a substitution in one or several\ndimensions of some word vectors. As a result, the RPN can introduce a certain\ndegree of perturbation to the sample and can adjust the range of perturbation\non different tasks. The augmented samples are then used to give the model\ntraining.This makes the model more robust. In subsequent experiments, we found\nthat adding RPN to the training or fine-tuning model resulted in a stable boost\non all 8 natural language processing tasks, including TweetEval, CoLA, and\nSST-2 datasets, and more significant improvements than other data augmentation\nalgorithms.The RPN algorithm applies to all sentence-level tasks for language\nunderstanding and is used in any deep learning model with a word embedding\nlayer.",

Can we fix the faulty behavior of the RNN by replacing\nportions associated with the faulty behavior? Recent works on decomposing a\nfully connected neural network (FCNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN)\ninto modules have shown the value of engineering deep models in this manner,\nwhich is standard in traditional SE but foreign for deep learning models.\nHowever, prior works focus on the image-based multiclass classification\nproblems and cannot be applied to RNN due to (a) different layer structures,\n(b) loop structures, (c) different types of input-output architectures, and (d)\nusage of both nonlinear and logistic activation functions.

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable success in image\ngeneration. Their guidance formulation allows an external model to\nplug-and-play control the generation process for various tasks without\nfine-tuning the diffusion model. However, the direct use of publicly available\noff-the-shelf models for guidance fails due to their poor performance on noisy\ninputs. For that, the existing practice is to fine-tune the guidance models\nwith labeled data corrupted with noises. In this paper, we argue that this\npractice has limitations in two aspects: (1) performing on inputs with\nextremely various noises is too hard for a single model; (2) collecting labeled\ndatasets hinders scaling up for various tasks. To tackle the limitations, we\npropose a novel strategy that leverages multiple experts where each expert is\nspecialized in a particular noise range and guides the reverse process at its\ncorresponding timesteps. However, as it is infeasible to manage multiple\nnetworks and utilize labeled data, we present a practical guidance framework\ntermed Practical Plug-And-Play (PPAP), which leverages parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning and data-free knowledge transfer. We exhaustively conduct ImageNet\nclass conditional generation experiments to show that our method can\nsuccessfully guide diffusion with small trainable parameters and no labeled\ndata.

To support\nvarious language understanding tasks, a foundation NLP model is often\nfine-tuned in a federated, privacy-preserving setting (FL). This process\ncurrently relies on at least hundreds of thousands of labeled training samples\nfrom mobile clients; yet mobile users often lack willingness or knowledge to\nlabel their data. Such an inadequacy of data labels is known as a few-shot\nscenario; it becomes the key blocker for mobile NLP applications.\nFor the first time, this work investigates federated NLP in the few-shot\nscenario (FedFSL). By retrofitting algorithmic advances of pseudo labeling and\nprompt learning, we first establish a training pipeline that delivers\ncompetitive accuracy when only 0.05% (fewer than 100) of the training data is\nlabeled and the remaining is unlabeled. To instantiate the workflow, we further\npresent a system FFNLP, addressing the high execution cost with novel designs.\n(1) Curriculum pacing, which injects pseudo labels to the training workflow at\na rate commensurate to the learning progress; (2) Representational diversity, a\nmechanism for selecting the most learnable data, only for which pseudo labels\nwill be generated; (3) Co-planning of a model's training depth and layer\ncapacity.

One foundational building\nblock in the application of ML to software artifacts is the representation of\nthese artifacts (e.g., source code or executable code) into a form that is\nsuitable for learning. Many studies have leveraged representation learning,\ndelegating to ML itself the job of automatically devising suitable\nrepresentations. Yet, in the context of Android problems, existing models are\neither limited to coarse-grained whole-app level (e.g., apk2vec) or conducted\nfor one specific downstream task (e.g., smali2vec).

Such representations aim to capture information relevant to\nvarious low-level downstream tasks (e.g., at the class-level). We are inspired\nby the field of Natural Language Processing, where the problem of universal\nrepresentation was addressed by building Universal Language Models, such as\nBERT, whose goal is to capture abstract semantic information about sentences,\nin a way that is reusable for a variety of tasks.

The edge node serves users'\nrequests by either commanding the corresponding sensor to send a fresh status\nupdate or retrieving the most recently received measurement from the cache. We\naim to find a control policy at the edge node that minimizes the average\non-demand AoI over all sensors subject to per-slot transmission and energy\nconstraints under partial battery knowledge at the edge node. Namely, the\nlimited radio resources (e.g., bandwidth) causes that only a limited number of\nsensors can send status updates at each time slot (i.e., per-slot transmission\nconstraint) and the scarcity of energy for the EH sensors imposes an energy\nconstraint. Besides, the edge node is informed of the sensors' battery levels\nonly via received status update packets, leading to uncertainty about the\nbattery levels for the decision-making.We develop a low-complexity algorithm --\ntermed relax-then-truncate -- and prove that it is asymptotically optimal as\nthe number of sensors goes to infinity. Numerical results illustrate that the\nproposed method achieves significant gains over a request-aware greedy policy\nand show that it has near-optimal performance even for moderate numbers of\nsensors.",

We unify these dual roles by training a\nsingle auxiliary meta-network to output an importance weight as a function of\nthe instance. This measure is used at train time to reweight training data, and\nat test-time to rank test instances for selective classification. A second, key\ncomponent of our proposal is the meta-objective of minimizing dropout variance\n(the variance of classifier output when subjected to random weight dropout) for\ntraining the metanetwork.

    "abstract": "The most widely studied explainable AI (XAI) approaches are unsound. This is\nthe case with well-known model-agnostic explanation approaches, and it is also\nthe case with approaches based on saliency maps. One solution is to consider\nintrinsic interpretability, which does not exhibit the drawback of unsoundness.\nUnfortunately, intrinsic interpretability can display unwieldy explanation\nredundancy. Formal explainability represents the alternative to these\nnon-rigorous approaches, with one example being PI-explanations. Unfortunately,\nPI-explanations also exhibit important drawbacks, the most visible of which is\narguably their size. Recently, it has been observed that the (absolute) rigor\nof PI-explanations can be traded off for a smaller explanation size, by\ncomputing the so-called relevant sets. Given some positive {\\delta}, a set S of\nfeatures is {\\delta}-relevant if, when the features in S are fixed, the\nprobability of getting the target class exceeds {\\delta}. However, even for\nvery simple classifiers, the complexity of computing relevant sets of features\nis prohibitive, with the decision problem being NPPP-complete for circuit-based\nclassifiers. In contrast with earlier negative results, this paper investigates\npractical approaches for computing relevant sets for a number of widely used\nclassifiers that include Decision Trees (DTs), Naive Bayes Classifiers (NBCs),\nand several families of classifiers obtained from propositional languages.\nMoreover, the paper shows that, in practice, and for these families of\nclassifiers, relevant sets are easy to compute. Furthermore, the experiments\nconfirm that succinct sets of relevant features can be obtained for the\nfamilies of classifiers considered.",

    "abstract": "We address the challenge of recovering an underlying scene geometry and\ncolors from a sparse set of RGBD view observations. In this work, we present a\nnew solution that sequentially generates novel RGBD views along a camera\ntrajectory, and the scene geometry is simply the fusion result of these views.\nMore specifically, we maintain an intermediate surface mesh used for rendering\nnew RGBD views, which subsequently becomes complete by an inpainting network;\neach rendered RGBD view is later back-projected as a partial surface and is\nsupplemented into the intermediate mesh. The use of intermediate mesh and\ncamera projection helps solve the refractory problem of multi-view\ninconsistency. We practically implement the RGBD inpainting network as a\nversatile RGBD diffusion model, which is previously used for 2D generative\nmodeling; we make a modification to its reverse diffusion process to enable our\nuse. We evaluate our approach on the task of 3D scene synthesis from sparse\nRGBD inputs; extensive experiments on the ScanNet dataset demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our approach over existing ones.

    "abstract": "The unit commitment (UC) problem, which determines operating schedules of\ngeneration units to meet demand, is a fundamental task in power systems\noperation. Existing UC methods using mixed-integer programming are not\nwell-suited to highly stochastic systems. Approaches which more rigorously\naccount for uncertainty could yield large reductions in operating costs by\nreducing spinning reserve requirements; operating power stations at higher\nefficiencies; and integrating greater volumes of variable renewables. A\npromising approach to solving the UC problem is reinforcement learning (RL), a\nmethodology for optimal decision-making which has been used to conquer\nlong-standing grand challenges in artificial intelligence. This thesis explores\nthe application of RL to the UC problem and addresses challenges including\nrobustness under uncertainty; generalisability across multiple problem\ninstances; and scaling to larger power systems than previously studied. To\ntackle these issues, we develop guided tree search, a novel methodology\ncombining model-free RL and model-based planning. The UC problem is formalised\nas a Markov decision process and we develop an open-source environment based on\nreal data from Great Britain's power system to train RL agents. In problems of\nup to 100 generators, guided tree search is shown to be competitive with\ndeterministic UC methods, reducing operating costs by up to 1.4\\%. An advantage\nof RL is that the framework can be easily extended to incorporate\nconsiderations important to power systems operators such as robustness to\ngenerator failure, wind curtailment or carbon prices. When generator outages\nare considered, guided tree search saves over 2\\% in operating costs as\ncompared with methods using conventional $N-x$ reserve criteria.",

Furthermore, CNNs have major\napplications in understanding the nature of visual representations in the human\nbrain. Yet it remains poorly understood how CNNs actually make their decisions,\nwhat the nature of their internal representations is, and how their recognition\nstrategies differ from humans. Specifically, there is a major debate about the\nquestion of whether CNNs primarily rely on surface regularities of objects, or\nwhether they are capable of exploiting the spatial arrangement of features,\nsimilar to humans. Here, we develop a novel feature-scrambling approach to\nexplicitly test whether CNNs use the spatial arrangement of features (i.e.\nobject parts) to classify objects. We combine this approach with a systematic\nmanipulation of effective receptive field sizes of CNNs as well as minimal\nrecognizable configurations (MIRCs) analysis. In contrast to much previous\nliterature, we provide evidence that CNNs are in fact capable of using\nrelatively long-range spatial relationships for object classification.\nMoreover, the extent to which CNNs use spatial relationships depends heavily on\nthe dataset, e.g. texture vs. sketch. In fact, CNNs even use different\nstrategies for different classes within heterogeneous datasets (ImageNet),\nsuggesting CNNs have a continuous spectrum of classification strategies.\nFinally, we show that CNNs learn the spatial arrangement of features only up to\nan intermediate level of granularity, which suggests that intermediate rather\nthan global shape features provide the optimal trade-off between sensitivity\nand specificity in object classification.

Materials and Methods: We identified 3657 patients\ndiagnosed with MCI together with their progress notes from Northwestern\nMedicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) between 2000-2020. The progress\nnotes no later than the first MCI diagnosis were used for the prediction.

The embeddings of all the sections\nof a patient's notes processed by AD-BERT were combined by MaxPooling to\ncompute the probability of MCI-to-AD progression. For replication, we conducted\na similar set of experiments on 2563 MCI patients identified at Weill Cornell\nMedicine (WCM) during the same timeframe. Results: Compared with the 7 baseline\nmodels, the AD-BERT model achieved the best performance on both datasets, with\nArea Under receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.8170 and F1 score\nof 0.4178 on NMEDW dataset and AUC of 0.8830 and F1 score of 0.6836 on WCM\ndataset.

Information about conditions under\nwhich the classifier is able to support the decision maker is not available,\nwhile for instance information about when the system is not able to\ndifferentiate classes can be very helpful. In the development phase it can\nsupport the search for new features or combining models, and in the operational\nphase it supports decision makers in deciding e.g. not to use the system. This\npaper presents a method to explain the qualities of a trained base classifier,\ncalled PERFormance EXplainer (PERFEX). Our method consists of a meta tree\nlearning algorithm that is able to predict and explain under which conditions\nthe base classifier has a high or low error or any other classification\nperformance metric.

RL uses a framework with well-established formal concepts, which\nraises its attractiveness in learning profitable trading strategies. However,\nRL use without due attention in the financial area can prevent new researchers\nfrom following standards or failing to adopt relevant conceptual guidelines.

A selection of twenty-nine articles was reviewed under our\nclassification that considers RL's most common formulations and design patterns\nfrom a large volume of available studies. This classification allowed for\nprecise inspection of the most relevant aspects regarding data input,\npreprocessing, state and action composition, adopted RL techniques, evaluation\nsetups, and overall results. Our analysis approach organized around fundamental\nRL concepts allowed for a clear identification of current system design best\npractices, gaps that require further investigation, and promising research\nopportunities.

    "title": "Prompting Is Programming: A Query Language For Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Large language models have demonstrated outstanding performance on a wide\nrange of tasks such as question answering and code generation. On a high level,\ngiven an input, a language model can be used to automatically complete the\nsequence in a statistically-likely way. Based on this, users prompt these\nmodels with language instructions or examples, to implement a variety of\ndownstream tasks. Advanced prompting methods can even imply interaction between\nthe language model, a user, and external tools such as calculators. However, to\nobtain state-of-the-art performance or adapt language models for specific\ntasks, complex task- and model-specific programs have to be implemented, which\nmay still require ad-hoc interaction.\nBased on this, we present the novel idea of Language Model Programming (LMP).\nLMP generalizes language model prompting from pure text prompts to an intuitive\ncombination of text prompting and scripting. Additionally, LMP allows\nconstraints to be specified over the language model output. This enables easy\nadaption to many tasks, while abstracting language model internals and\nproviding high-level semantics. To enable LMP, we implement LMQL (short for\nLanguage Model Query Language), which leverages the constraints and control\nflow from an LMP prompt to generate an efficient inference procedure that\nminimizes the number of expensive calls to the underlying language model. We\nshow that LMQL can capture a wide range of state-of-the-art prompting methods\nin an intuitive way, especially facilitating interactive flows that are\nchallenging to implement with existing high-level APIs. Our evaluation shows\nthat we retain or increase the accuracy on several downstream tasks, while also\nsignificantly reducing the required amount of computation or cost in the case\nof pay-to-use APIs (13-85% cost savings).",

    "abstract": "Steerable convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide a general framework\nfor building neural networks equivariant to translations and other\ntransformations belonging to an origin-preserving group $G$, such as\nreflections and rotations. They rely on standard convolutions with\n$G$-steerable kernels obtained by analytically solving the group-specific\nequivariance constraint imposed onto the kernel space. As the solution is\ntailored to a particular group $G$, the implementation of a kernel basis does\nnot generalize to other symmetry transformations, which complicates the\ndevelopment of group equivariant models.

Recently, methods employing\ngenerative models like GANs have shown some of the best results, where\nunseen-class samples are generated based on their semantics by a GAN trained on\nseen-class data, enabling vanilla object detectors to recognize unseen objects.\nHowever, the problem of semantic confusion still remains, where the model is\nsometimes unable to distinguish between semantically-similar classes.

    "abstract": "Split learning (SL) is an emergent distributed learning framework which can\nmitigate the computation and wireless communication overhead of federated\nlearning. It splits a machine learning model into a device-side model and a\nserver-side model at a cut layer. Devices only train their allocated model and\ntransmit the activations of the cut layer to the server. However, SL can lead\nto data leakage as the server can reconstruct the input data using the\ncorrelation between the input and intermediate activations. Although allocating\nmore layers to a device-side model can reduce the possibility of data leakage,\nthis will lead to more energy consumption for resource-constrained devices and\nmore training time for the server. Moreover, non-iid datasets across devices\nwill reduce the convergence rate leading to increased training time. In this\npaper, a new personalized SL framework is proposed. For this framework, a novel\napproach for choosing the cut layer that can optimize the tradeoff between the\nenergy consumption for computation and wireless transmission, training time,\nand data privacy is developed. In the considered framework, each device\npersonalizes its device-side model to mitigate non-iid datasets while sharing\nthe same server-side model for generalization. To balance the energy\nconsumption for computation and wireless transmission, training time, and data\nprivacy, a multiplayer bargaining problem is formulated to find the optimal cut\nlayer between devices and the server. To solve the problem, the\nKalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution (KSBS) is obtained using the bisection\nmethod with the feasibility test. Simulation results show that the proposed\npersonalized SL framework with the cut layer from the KSBS can achieve the\noptimal sum utilities by balancing the energy consumption, training time, and\ndata privacy, and it is also robust to non-iid datasets.",

A significant challenge in generating such avatars is that the memory\nand processing costs in 3D are prohibitive for producing the rich details\nrequired for high-quality avatars. To tackle this problem we propose the\nroll-out diffusion network (Rodin), which represents a neural radiance field as\nmultiple 2D feature maps and rolls out these maps into a single 2D feature\nplane within which we perform 3D-aware diffusion. The Rodin model brings the\nmuch-needed computational efficiency while preserving the integrity of\ndiffusion in 3D by using 3D-aware convolution that attends to projected\nfeatures in the 2D feature plane according to their original relationship in\n3D.

    "abstract": "Nonconvex optimization is central in solving many machine learning problems,\nin which block-wise structure is commonly encountered. In this work, we propose\ncyclic block coordinate methods for nonconvex optimization problems with\nnon-asymptotic gradient norm guarantees. Our convergence analysis is based on a\ngradient Lipschitz condition with respect to a Mahalanobis norm, inspired by a\nrecent progress on cyclic block coordinate methods. In deterministic settings,\nour convergence guarantee matches the guarantee of (full-gradient) gradient\ndescent, but with the gradient Lipschitz constant being defined w.r.t.~the\nMahalanobis norm. In stochastic settings, we use recursive variance reduction\nto decrease the per-iteration cost and match the arithmetic operation\ncomplexity of current optimal stochastic full-gradient methods, with a unified\nanalysis for both finite-sum and infinite-sum cases. We further prove the\nfaster, linear convergence of our methods when a Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (P{\\L})\ncondition holds for the objective function. To the best of our knowledge, our\nwork is the first to provide variance-reduced convergence guarantees for a\ncyclic block coordinate method.

    "abstract": "While skin cancer classification has been a popular and valuable deep\nlearning application for years, there has been little consideration of the\ncontext in which testing images are taken. Traditional melanoma classifiers\nrely on the assumption that their testing environments are analogous to the\nstructured images on which they are trained. This paper combats this notion,\narguing that mole size, a vital attribute in professional dermatology, is a red\nherring in automated melanoma detection. Although malignant melanomas are\nconsistently larger than benign melanomas, this distinction proves unreliable\nand harmful when images cannot be contextually scaled. This implementation\nbuilds a custom model that eliminates size as a training feature to prevent\noverfitting to incorrect parameters. Additionally, random rotation and contrast\naugmentations are performed to simulate the real-world use of melanoma\ndetection applications. Several custom models with varying forms of data\naugmentation are implemented to demonstrate the most significant features of\nthe generalization abilities of mole classifiers. These implementations show\nthat user unpredictability is crucial when utilizing such applications. The\ncaution required when manually modifying data is acknowledged, as data loss and\nbiased conclusions are necessary considerations in this process. Additionally,\nmole size inconsistency and its significance are discussed in both the\ndermatology and deep learning communities.",

In this paper, we compute the entropy production of diffusion\nprocesses at non-equilibrium steady-state under the condition that the\ntime-reversal of the diffusion remains a diffusion. We start by characterising\nthe entropy production of both discrete and continuous-time Markov processes.\nWe investigate the time-reversal of time-homogeneous stationary diffusions and\nrecall the most general conditions for the reversibility of the diffusion\nproperty, which includes hypoelliptic and degenerate diffusions, and locally\nLipschitz vector fields. We decompose the drift into its time-reversible and\nirreversible parts, or equivalently, the generator into symmetric and\nantisymmetric operators. We show the equivalence with a decomposition of the\nbackward Kolmogorov equation considered in hypocoercivity theory, and a\ndecomposition of the Fokker-Planck equation in GENERIC form. The main result\nshows that when the time-irreversible part of the drift is in the range of the\nvolatility matrix (almost everywhere) the forward and time-reversed path space\nmeasures of the process are mutually equivalent, and evaluates the entropy\nproduction. When this does not hold, the measures are mutually singular and the\nentropy production is infinite. We verify these results using exact numerical\nsimulations of linear diffusions. We illustrate the discrepancy between the\nentropy production of non-linear diffusions and their numerical simulations in\nseveral examples and illustrate how the entropy production can be used for\naccurate numerical simulation. Finally, we discuss the relationship between\ntime-irreversibility and sampling efficiency, and how we can modify the\ndefinition of entropy production to score how far a process is from being\ngeneralised reversible.",

    "abstract": "The concept of walkable urban development has gained increased attention due\nto its public health, economic, and environmental sustainability benefits.\nUnfortunately, land zoning and historic under-investment have resulted in\nspatial inequality in walkability and social inequality among residents. We\ntackle the problem of Walkability Optimization through the lens of\ncombinatorial optimization. The task is to select locations in which additional\namenities (e.g., grocery stores, schools, restaurants) can be allocated to\nimprove resident access via walking while taking into account existing\namenities and providing multiple options (e.g., for restaurants). To this end,\nwe derive Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Constraint Programming\n(CP) models. Moreover, we show that the problem's objective function is\nsubmodular in special cases, which motivates an efficient greedy heuristic. We\nconduct a case study on 31 underserved neighborhoods in the City of Toronto,\nCanada. MILP finds the best solutions in most scenarios but does not scale well\nwith network size. The greedy algorithm scales well and finds near-optimal\nsolutions. Our empirical evaluation shows that neighbourhoods with low\nwalkability have a great potential for transformation into pedestrian-friendly\nneighbourhoods by strategically placing new amenities. Allocating 3 additional\ngrocery stores, schools, and restaurants can improve the \"WalkScore\" by more\nthan 50 points (on a scale of 100) for 4 neighbourhoods and reduce the walking\ndistances to amenities for 75% of all residential locations to 10 minutes for\nall amenity types.

    "abstract": "Cooperation is fundamental for human prosperity. Blockchain, as a trust\nmachine, is a cooperative institution in cyberspace that supports cooperation\nthrough distributed trust with consensus protocols. While studies in computer\nscience focus on fault tolerance problems with consensus algorithms, economic\nresearch utilizes incentive designs to analyze agent behaviors. To achieve\ncooperation on blockchains, emerging interdisciplinary research introduces\nrationality and game-theoretical solution concepts to study the equilibrium\noutcomes of various consensus protocols. However, existing studies do not\nconsider the possibility for agents to learn from historical observations.\nTherefore, we abstract a general consensus protocol as a dynamic game\nenvironment, apply a solution concept of bounded rationality to model agent\nbehavior, and resolve the initial conditions for three different stable\nequilibria. In our game, agents imitatively learn the global history in an\nevolutionary process toward equilibria, for which we evaluate the outcomes from\nboth computing and economic perspectives in terms of safety, liveness,\nvalidity, and social welfare. Our research contributes to the literature across\ndisciplines, including distributed consensus in computer science, game theory\nin economics on blockchain consensus, evolutionary game theory at the\nintersection of biology and economics, bounded rationality at the interplay\nbetween psychology and economics, and cooperative AI with joint insights into\ncomputing and social science. Finally, we discuss that future protocol design\ncan better achieve the most desired outcomes of our honest stable equilibria by\nincreasing the reward-punishment ratio and lowering both the cost-punishment\nratio and the pivotality rate.",

In this paper, we propose an\nalgorithm to achieve rigorous $\\epsilon$-differential privacy in\ngradient-tracking-based distributed optimization. {More specifically, to\nsuppress the influence of differential-privacy noise, we propose a new robust\ngradient-tracking based distributed optimization algorithm that allows both\nstepsize and the variance of injected noise to be varying with time. Then, we\npropose a new analyzing approach that can characterize the convergence of the\ngradient-tracking based algorithm under both constant and time-varying\nstespsizes. To our knowledge, this is the first time that both constant and\ntime-varying stepsizes are treated in a unified framework for gradient-tacking\nbased distributed optimization. More interestingly, the new analysis approach\ngives a much less conservative bound on the stepsize compared with existing\nproof techniques for gradient-tracking based distributed optimization.} We also\ntheoretically characterize the influence of differential-privacy design on the\naccuracy of distributed optimization, which reveals that inter-agent\ninteraction has a significant impact on the final optimization accuracy.

In the chemical context, this enables the\nmethod to learn propensity functions from non-mass-action kinetics. We test our\nmethod with synthetic data generated from a variety of systems with known\ntransition rates.

For a linear feedback law to\nbe feasible for a self-powered control system, its feedback signal must be\ncolocated with the control inputs, and its input-output mapping must satisfy an\nassociated passivity constraint. The imposition of such a feedback law can be\nviewed equivalently as the imposition of a linear passive shunt admittance at\nthe actuation ports of the plant. In this paper we consider the use of\nactively-controlled electronics to impose a self-powered linear feedback law.\nTo be feasible, it is insufficient that the imposed admittance be passive,\nbecause parasitic losses must additionally be overcome. We derive sufficient\nfeasibility conditions which explicitly account for these losses.

Clinically, to assess the necessity of cataract surgery,\naccurately predicting postoperative VA before surgery by analyzing multi-view\noptical coherence tomography (OCT) images is crucially needed. Unfortunately,\ndue to complicated fundus conditions, determining postoperative VA remains\ndifficult for medical experts. Deep learning methods for this problem were\ndeveloped in recent years. Although effective, these methods still face several\nissues, such as not efficiently exploring potential relations between\nmulti-view OCT images, neglecting the key role of clinical prior knowledge\n(e.g., preoperative VA value), and using only regression-based metrics which\nare lacking reference. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-token\nTransformer Network (CTT-Net) for postoperative VA prediction by analyzing both\nthe multi-view OCT images and preoperative VA. To effectively fuse multi-view\nfeatures of OCT images, we develop cross-token attention that could restrict\nredundant/unnecessary attention flow. Further, we utilize the preoperative VA\nvalue to provide more information for postoperative VA prediction and\nfacilitate fusion between views. Moreover, we design an auxiliary\nclassification loss to improve model performance and assess VA recovery more\nsufficiently, avoiding the limitation by only using the regression metrics. To\nevaluate CTT-Net, we build a multi-view OCT image dataset collected from our\ncollaborative hospital. A set of extensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of our model compared to existing methods in various metrics.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/wjh892521292/Cataract OCT.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most prevalent cancers in men and many\npeople around the world die from clinically significant PCa (csPCa). Early\ndiagnosis of csPCa in bi-parametric MRI (bpMRI), which is non-invasive,\ncost-effective, and more efficient compared to multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), can\ncontribute to precision care for PCa. The rapid rise in artificial intelligence\n(AI) algorithms are enabling unprecedented improvements in providing decision\nsupport systems that can aid in csPCa diagnosis and understanding. However,\nexisting state of the art AI algorithms which are based on deep learning\ntechnology are often limited to 2D images that fails to capture inter-slice\ncorrelations in 3D volumetric images. The use of 3D convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) partly overcomes this limitation, but it does not adapt to the\nanisotropy of images, resulting in sub-optimal semantic representation and poor\ngeneralization. Furthermore, due to the limitation of the amount of labelled\ndata of bpMRI and the difficulty of labelling, existing CNNs are built on\nrelatively small datasets, leading to a poor performance. To address the\nlimitations identified above, we propose a new Zonal-aware Self-supervised Mesh\nNetwork (Z-SSMNet) that adaptatively fuses multiple 2D, 2.5D and 3D CNNs to\neffectively balance representation for sparse inter-slice information and dense\nintra-slice information in bpMRI. A self-supervised learning (SSL) technique is\nfurther introduced to pre-train our network using unlabelled data to learn the\ngeneralizable image features. Furthermore, we constrained our network to\nunderstand the zonal specific domain knowledge to improve the diagnosis\nprecision of csPCa. Experiments on the PI-CAI Challenge dataset demonstrate our\nproposed method achieves better performance for csPCa detection and diagnosis\nin bpMRI.",

    "abstract": "Although understanding and characterizing causal effects have become\nessential in observational studies, it is challenging when the confounders are\nhigh-dimensional. In this article, we develop a general framework\n$\\textit{CausalEGM}$ for estimating causal effects by encoding generative\nmodeling, which can be applied in both binary and continuous treatment\nsettings. Under the potential outcome framework with unconfoundedness, we\nestablish a bidirectional transformation between the high-dimensional\nconfounders space and a low-dimensional latent space where the density is known\n(e.g., multivariate normal distribution). Through this, CausalEGM\nsimultaneously decouples the dependencies of confounders on both treatment and\noutcome and maps the confounders to the low-dimensional latent space. By\nconditioning on the low-dimensional latent features, CausalEGM can estimate the\ncausal effect for each individual or the average causal effect within a\npopulation. Our theoretical analysis shows that the excess risk for CausalEGM\ncan be bounded through empirical process theory. Under an assumption on\nencoder-decoder networks, the consistency of the estimate can be guaranteed. In\na series of experiments, CausalEGM demonstrates superior performance over\nexisting methods for both binary and continuous treatments. Specifically, we\nfind CausalEGM to be substantially more powerful than competing methods in the\npresence of large sample sizes and high dimensional confounders.

The proposed algorithm relies\non the recently developed uncertainty-weighted least-squares regression from\nlinear contextual bandit \\citep{he2022nearly} and a new weighted estimator of\nuncertainty for the general function class. In contrast to the existing\nanalysis that heavily relies on the linear structure, we develop a novel\ntechnique to control the sum of weighted uncertainty, thus establishing the\nfinal regret bounds. We then generalize our algorithm to the episodic MDP\nsetting and first achieve an additive dependence on the corruption level\n$\\zeta$ in the scenario of general function approximation.

    "abstract": "The deepening of the penetration of renewable energy is challenging how power\nsystem operators cope with their associated variability and uncertainty. The\ninherent flexibility of dispathchable assets present in power systems, which is\noften ill-characterized, is essential in addressing this challenge. Several\nproposals for explicit flexibility characterization focus on defining a\nfeasible region that secures operations either in generation or uncertainty\nspaces. The main drawback of these approaches is the difficulty in visualizing\nthis feasibility region when there are multiple uncertain parameters. Moreover,\nthese approaches focus on system operational constraints and often neglect the\nimpact of inherent couplings (e.g., spatial correlation) of renewable\ngeneration and demand variability. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel data-driven inverse optimization framework for flexibility\ncharacterization of power systems in the demand space along with its geometric\nintuition. The approach captures the spatial correlation of multi-site\nrenewable generation and load using polyhedral uncertainty sets. Moreover, the\nframework projects the uncertainty on the feasibility region of power systems\nin the demand space, which are also called loadability sets. The proposed\ninverse optimization scheme, recast as a linear optimization problem, is used\nto infer system flexibility adequacy from loadability sets.",

    "abstract": "The lack of standardization is a prominent issue in magnetic resonance (MR)\nimaging. This often causes undesired contrast variations due to differences in\nhardware and acquisition parameters. In recent years, MR harmonization using\nimage synthesis with disentanglement has been proposed to compensate for the\nundesired contrast variations. Despite the success of existing methods, we\nargue that three major improvements can be made. First, most existing methods\nare built upon the assumption that multi-contrast MR images of the same subject\nshare the same anatomy. This assumption is questionable since different MR\ncontrasts are specialized to highlight different anatomical features. Second,\nthese methods often require a fixed set of MR contrasts for training (e.g.,\nboth Tw-weighted and T2-weighted images must be available), which limits their\napplicability. Third, existing methods generally are sensitive to imaging\nartifacts. In this paper, we present a novel approach, Harmonization with\nAttention-based Contrast, Anatomy, and Artifact Awareness (HACA3), to address\nthese three issues. We first propose an anatomy fusion module that enables\nHACA3 to respect the anatomical differences between MR contrasts. HACA3 is also\nrobust to imaging artifacts and can be trained and applied to any set of MR\ncontrasts. Experiments show that HACA3 achieves state-of-the-art performance\nunder multiple image quality metrics.

Subsequently, the receiver extracts the channel frequency response\n(basically, fine-grained wireless channel state information), and feeds it to\nvarious ML algorithms which eventually classify between different breathing\nabnormalities. Among all classifiers, linear SVM classifier resulted in a\nmaximum accuracy of 88.1\\%. To train the ML classifiers in a supervised manner,\ndata was collected by doing real-time experiments on 4 subjects in a lab\nenvironment.

Furthermore,\nin addition to our proposed method (where only a hand is exposed to RF\nsignals), we also implemented and tested the state-of-the-art method (where\nfull chest is exposed to RF radiation). The performance comparison of the two\nmethods reveals a trade-off, i.e., the accuracy of our proposed method is\nslightly inferior but our method results in minimal body exposure to RF\nradiation, compared to the benchmark method.",
