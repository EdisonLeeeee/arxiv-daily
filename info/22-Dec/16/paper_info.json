    "title": "Hope Speech Detection on Social Media Platforms",
    "abstract": "Since personal computers became widely available in the consumer market, the\namount of harmful content on the internet has significantly expanded. In simple\nterms, harmful content is anything online which causes a person distress or\nharm. It may include hate speech, violent content, threats, non-hope speech,\netc. The online content must be positive, uplifting and supportive. Over the\npast few years, many studies have focused on solving this problem through hate\nspeech detection, but very few focused on identifying hope speech. This paper\ndiscusses various machine learning approaches to identify a sentence as Hope\nSpeech, Non-Hope Speech, or a Neutral sentence. The dataset used in the study\ncontains English YouTube comments and is released as a part of the shared task\n\"EACL-2021: Hope Speech Detection for Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion\".\nInitially, the dataset obtained from the shared task had three classes: Hope\nSpeech, non-Hope speech, and not in English; however, upon deeper inspection,\nwe discovered that dataset relabeling is required. A group of undergraduates\nwas hired to help perform the entire dataset's relabeling task. We experimented\nwith conventional machine learning models (such as Na\\\"ive Bayes, logistic\nregression and support vector machine) and pre-trained models (such as BERT) on\nrelabeled data. According to the experimental results, the relabeled data has\nachieved a better accuracy for Hope speech identification than the original\ndata set.",

    "title": "Robust and Explainable Identification of Logical Fallacies in Natural  Language Arguments",
    "abstract": "The spread of misinformation, propaganda, and flawed argumentation has been\namplified in the Internet era. Given the volume of data and the subtlety of\nidentifying violations of argumentation norms, supporting information analytics\ntasks, like content moderation, with trustworthy methods that can identify\nlogical fallacies is essential. In this paper, we formalize prior theoretical\nwork on logical fallacies into a comprehensive three-stage evaluation framework\nof detection, coarse-grained, and fine-grained classification. We adapt\nexisting evaluation datasets for each stage of the evaluation. We devise three\nfamilies of robust and explainable methods based on prototype reasoning,\ninstance-based reasoning, and knowledge injection. The methods are designed to\ncombine language models with background knowledge and explainable mechanisms.\nMoreover, we address data sparsity with strategies for data augmentation and\ncurriculum learning. Our three-stage framework natively consolidates prior\ndatasets and methods from existing tasks, like propaganda detection, serving as\nan overarching evaluation testbed. We extensively evaluate these methods on our\ndatasets, focusing on their robustness and explainability. Our results provide\ninsight into the strengths and weaknesses of the methods on different\ncomponents and fallacy classes, indicating that fallacy identification is a\nchallenging task that may require specialized forms of reasoning to capture\nvarious classes. We share our open-source code and data on GitHub to support\nfurther work on logical fallacy identification.",

Hence, any advances in related theory may\ntranslate into large-scale impact. Here we explore how algorithmic information\ntheory, especially algorithmic probability, may aid in a machine learning task.\nWe study a multiclass supervised classification problem, namely learning the\nRNA molecule sequence-to-shape map, where the different possible shapes are\ntaken to be the classes. The primary motivation for this work is a proof of\nconcept example, where a concrete, well-motivated machine learning task can be\naided by approximations to algorithmic probability. Our approach is based on\ndirectly estimating the class (i.e., shape) probabilities from shape\ncomplexities, and using the estimated probabilities as a prior in a Gaussian\nprocess learning problem. Naturally, with a large amount of training data, the\nprior has no significant influence on classification accuracy, but in the very\nsmall training data regime, we show that using the prior can substantially\nimprove classification accuracy. To our knowledge, this work is one of the\nfirst to demonstrate how algorithmic probability can aid in a concrete,\nreal-world, machine learning problem.",

Despite their ubiquity and\nrelevance, there have been few attempts to develop effective means of\nrepresenting harmonic functions in the context of machine learning\narchitectures, either in machine learning on classical computers, or in the\nnascent field of quantum machine learning. Architectures which impose or\nencourage an inductive bias towards harmonic functions would facilitate\ndata-driven modelling and the solution of inverse problems in a range of\napplications. For classical neural networks, it has already been established\nhow leveraging inductive biases can in general lead to improved performance of\nlearning algorithms. The introduction of such inductive biases within a quantum\nmachine learning setting is instead still in its nascent stages. In this work,\nwe derive exactly-harmonic (conventional- and quantum-) neural networks in two\ndimensions for simply-connected domains by leveraging the characteristics of\nholomorphic complex functions. We then demonstrate how these can be\napproximately extended to multiply-connected two-dimensional domains using\ntechniques inspired by domain decomposition in physics-informed neural\nnetworks. We further provide architectures and training protocols to\neffectively impose approximately harmonic constraints in three dimensions and\nhigher, and as a corollary we report divergence-free network architectures in\narbitrary dimensions.

    "abstract": "Existing analyses of neural network training often operate under the\nunrealistic assumption of an extremely small learning rate. This lies in stark\ncontrast to practical wisdom and empirical studies, such as the work of J.\nCohen et al. (ICLR 2021), which exhibit startling new phenomena (the \"edge of\nstability\" or \"unstable convergence\") and potential benefits for generalization\nin the large learning rate regime. Despite a flurry of recent works on this\ntopic, however, the latter effect is still poorly understood. In this paper, we\ntake a step towards understanding genuinely non-convex training dynamics with\nlarge learning rates by performing a detailed analysis of gradient descent for\nsimplified models of two-layer neural networks. For these models, we provably\nestablish the edge of stability phenomenon and discover a sharp phase\ntransition for the step size below which the neural network fails to learn\n\"threshold-like\" neurons (i.e., neurons with a non-zero first-layer bias). This\nelucidates one possible mechanism by which the edge of stability can in fact\nlead to better generalization, as threshold neurons are basic building blocks\nwith useful inductive bias for many tasks.",

We present an\nalgorithm that accelerates the training of random forests and other popular\ntree-based learning methods. At the core of our algorithm is a novel\nnode-splitting subroutine, dubbed MABSplit, used to efficiently find split\npoints when constructing decision trees. Our algorithm borrows techniques from\nthe multi-armed bandit literature to judiciously determine how to allocate\nsamples and computational power across candidate split points. We provide\ntheoretical guarantees that MABSplit improves the sample complexity of each\nnode split from linear to logarithmic in the number of data points. In some\nsettings, MABSplit leads to 100x faster training (an 99% reduction in training\ntime) without any decrease in generalization performance. We demonstrate\nsimilar speedups when MABSplit is used across a variety of forest-based\nvariants, such as Extremely Random Forests and Random Patches. We also show our\nalgorithm can be used in both classification and regression tasks.

    "abstract": "The text-to-image model Stable Diffusion has recently become very popular.\nOnly weeks after its open source release, millions are experimenting with image\ngeneration. This is due to its ease of use, since all it takes is a brief\ndescription of the desired image to \"prompt\" the generative model. Rarely do\nthe images generated for a new prompt immediately meet the user's expectations.\nUsually, an iterative refinement of the prompt (\"prompt engineering\") is\nnecessary for satisfying images. As a new perspective, we recast image prompt\nengineering as interactive image retrieval - on an \"infinite index\". Thereby, a\nprompt corresponds to a query and prompt engineering to query refinement.\nSelected image-prompt pairs allow direct relevance feedback, as the model can\nmodify an image for the refined prompt. This is a form of one-sided interactive\nretrieval, where the initiative is on the user side, whereas the server side\nremains stateless. In light of an extensive literature review, we develop these\nparallels in detail and apply the findings to a case study of a creative search\ntask on such a model. We note that the uncertainty in searching an infinite\nindex is virtually never-ending. We also discuss future research opportunities\nrelated to retrieval models specialized for generative models and interactive\ngenerative image retrieval.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of off-policy evaluation (OPE) in reinforcement\nlearning (RL), where the goal is to estimate the performance of an evaluation\npolicy, $\\pi_e$, using a fixed dataset, $\\mathcal{D}$, collected by one or more\npolicies that may be different from $\\pi_e$. Current OPE algorithms may produce\npoor OPE estimates under policy distribution shift i.e., when the probability\nof a particular state-action pair occurring under $\\pi_e$ is very different\nfrom the probability of that same pair occurring in $\\mathcal{D}$ (Voloshin et\nal. 2021, Fu et al. 2021). In this work, we propose to improve the accuracy of\nOPE estimators by projecting the high-dimensional state-space into a\nlow-dimensional state-space using concepts from the state abstraction\nliterature. Specifically, we consider marginalized importance sampling (MIS)\nOPE algorithms which compute state-action distribution correction ratios to\nproduce their OPE estimate. In the original ground state-space, these ratios\nmay have high variance which may lead to high variance OPE. However, we prove\nthat in the lower-dimensional abstract state-space the ratios can have lower\nvariance resulting in lower variance OPE. We then highlight the challenges that\narise when estimating the abstract ratios from data, identify sufficient\nconditions to overcome these issues, and present a minimax optimization problem\nwhose solution yields these abstract ratios. Finally, our empirical evaluation\non difficult, high-dimensional state-space OPE tasks shows that the abstract\nratios can make MIS OPE estimators achieve lower mean-squared error and more\nrobust to hyperparameter tuning than the ground ratios.",

To address this\nlimitation, we introduce SMACv2, a new version of the benchmark where scenarios\nare procedurally generated and require agents to generalise to previously\nunseen settings (from the same distribution) during evaluation. We show that\nthese changes ensure the benchmark requires the use of closed-loop policies. We\nevaluate state-of-the-art algorithms on SMACv2 and show that it presents\nsignificant challenges not present in the original benchmark. Our analysis\nillustrates that SMACv2 addresses the discovered deficiencies of SMAC and can\nhelp benchmark the next generation of MARL methods.

    "abstract": "Iterative solutions of sparse linear systems and sparse eigenvalue problems\nhave a fundamental role in vital fields of scientific research and engineering.\nThe crucial computing kernel for such iterative solutions is the multiplication\nof a sparse matrix by a dense vector. Efficient implementation of sparse\nmatrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) and linear solvers are therefore essential\nand has been subjected to extensive research across a variety of computing\narchitectures and accelerators such as central processing units (CPUs),\ngraphical processing units (GPUs), many integrated cores (MICs), and field\nprogrammable gate arrays (FPGAs). Unleashing the full potential of an\narchitecture/accelerator requires determining the factors that affect an\nefficient implementation of SpMV. This article presents the first of its kind,\nin-depth survey covering over two hundred state-of-the-art optimization schemes\nfor solving sparse iterative linear systems with a focus on computing SpMV. A\nnew taxonomy for iterative solutions and SpMV techniques common to all\narchitectures is proposed. This article includes reviews of SpMV techniques for\nall architectures to consolidate a single taxonomy to encourage\ncross-architectural and heterogeneous-architecture developments. However, the\nprimary focus is on GPUs. The major contributions as well as the primary,\nsecondary, and tertiary contributions of the SpMV techniques are first\nhighlighted utilizing the taxonomy and then qualitatively compared. A summary\nof the current state of the research for each architecture is discussed\nseparately. Finally, several open problems and key challenges for future\nresearch directions are outlined.",

Secondly, we aim for\na holistic pipeline cost- and rule-based optimization across relational and\nmodel-based operators.

Such bags may not only cause problem in the ginning process but might\nalso get embodied in cotton fibers reducing its quality and marketable value.\nTherefore, it is required to detect, locate, and remove the bags before cotton\nis harvested. Manually detecting and locating these bags in cotton fields is\nlabor intensive, time-consuming and a costly process. To solve these\nchallenges, we present application of four variants of YOLOv5 (YOLOv5s,\nYOLOv5m, YOLOv5l and YOLOv5x) for detecting plastic shopping bags using\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)-acquired RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) images. We\nalso show fixed effect model tests of color of plastic bags as well as\nYOLOv5-variant on average precision (AP), mean average precision (mAP@50) and\naccuracy. In addition, we also demonstrate the effect of height of plastic bags\non the detection accuracy. It was found that color of bags had significant\neffect (p < 0.001) on accuracy across all the four variants while it did not\nshow any significant effect on the AP with YOLOv5m (p = 0.10) and YOLOv5x (p =\n0.35) at 95% confidence level. Similarly, YOLOv5-variant did not show any\nsignificant effect on the AP (p = 0.11) and accuracy (p = 0.73) of white bags,\nbut it had significant effects on the AP (p = 0.03) and accuracy (p = 0.02) of\nbrown bags including on the mAP@50 (p = 0.01) and inference speed (p < 0.0001).\nAdditionally, height of plastic bags had significant effect (p < 0.0001) on\noverall detection accuracy.

    "abstract": "The policy gradient method enjoys the simplicity of the objective where the\nagent optimizes the cumulative reward directly. Moreover, in the continuous\naction domain, parameterized distribution of action distribution allows easy\ncontrol of exploration, resulting from the variance of the representing\ndistribution. Entropy can play an essential role in policy optimization by\nselecting the stochastic policy, which eventually helps better explore the\nenvironment in reinforcement learning (RL). However, the stochasticity often\nreduces as the training progresses; thus, the policy becomes less exploratory.\nAdditionally, certain parametric distributions might only work for some\nenvironments and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. This paper aims to\nmitigate these issues. In particular, we propose an algorithm called Robust\nPolicy Optimization (RPO), which leverages a perturbed distribution. We\nhypothesize that our method encourages high-entropy actions and provides a way\nto represent the action space better. We further provide empirical evidence to\nverify our hypothesis. We evaluated our methods on various continuous control\ntasks from DeepMind Control, OpenAI Gym, Pybullet, and IsaacGym. We observed\nthat in many settings, RPO increases the policy entropy early in training and\nthen maintains a certain level of entropy throughout the training period.\nEventually, our agent RPO shows consistently improved performance compared to\nPPO and other techniques: entropy regularization, different distributions, and\ndata augmentation. Furthermore, in several settings, our method stays robust in\nperformance, while other baseline mechanisms fail to improve and even worsen\nthe performance.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) influence personal health\noutcomes and health systems interactions. Health systems capture SDOH\ninformation through structured data and unstructured clinical notes; however,\nclinical notes often contain a more comprehensive representation of several key\nSDOH. The objective of this work is to assess the SDOH information gain\nachievable by extracting structured semantic representations of SDOH from the\nclinical narrative and combining these extracted representations with available\nstructured data.\nMaterials and Methods: We developed a natural language processing (NLP)\ninformation extraction model for SDOH that utilizes a deep learning entity and\nrelation extraction architecture. In an electronic health record (EHR) case\nstudy, we applied the SDOH extractor to a large existing clinical data set with\nover 200,000 patients and 400,000 notes and compared the extracted information\nwith available structured data.\nResults: The SDOH extractor achieved 0.86 F1 on a withheld test set. In the\nEHR case study, we found 19\\% of current tobacco users, 10\\% of drug users, and\n32\\% of homeless patients only include documentation of these risk factors in\nthe clinical narrative.\nConclusions: Patients who are at-risk for negative health outcomes due to\nSDOH may be better served if health systems are able to identify SDOH risk\nfactors and associated social needs. Structured semantic representations of\ntext-encoded SDOH information can augment existing structured, and this more\ncomprehensive SDOH representation can assist health systems in identifying and\naddressing social needs.",

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes a prominent part of modern life, AI\nliteracy is becoming important for all citizens, not just those in technology\ncareers. Previous research in AI education materials has largely focused on the\nintroduction of terminology as well as AI use cases and ethics, but few allow\nstudents to learn by creating their own machine learning models. Therefore,\nthere is a need for enriching AI educational tools with more adaptable and\nflexible platforms for interested educators with any level of technical\nexperience to utilize within their teaching material. As such, we propose the\ndevelopment of an open-source tool (Build-a-Bot) for students and teachers to\nnot only create their own transformer-based chatbots based on their own course\nmaterial, but also learn the fundamentals of AI through the model creation\nprocess. The primary concern of this paper is the creation of an interface for\nstudents to learn the principles of artificial intelligence by using a natural\nlanguage pipeline to train a customized model to answer questions based on\ntheir own school curriculums. The model uses contexts given by their\ninstructor, such as chapters of a textbook, to answer questions and is deployed\non an interactive chatbot/voice agent. The pipeline teaches students data\ncollection, data augmentation, intent recognition, and question answering by\nhaving them work through each of these processes while creating their AI agent,\ndiverging from previous chatbot work where students and teachers use the bots\nas black-boxes with no abilities for customization or the bots lack AI\ncapabilities, with the majority of dialogue scripts being rule-based. In\naddition, our tool is designed to make each step of this pipeline intuitive for\nstudents at a middle-school level. Further work primarily lies in providing our\ntool to schools and seeking student and teacher evaluations.",

    "abstract": "In manufacturing, the production is often done on out-of-the-shelf\nmanufacturing lines, whose underlying scheduling heuristics are not known due\nto the intellectual property. We consider such a setting with a black-box\njob-shop system and an unknown scheduling heuristic that, for a given\npermutation of jobs, schedules the jobs for the black-box job-shop with the\ngoal of minimizing the makespan. Here, the jobs need to enter the job-shop in\nthe given order of the permutation, but may take different paths within the job\nshop, which depends on the black-box heuristic. The performance of the\nblack-box heuristic depends on the order of the jobs, and the natural problem\nfor the manufacturer is to find an optimum ordering of the jobs.\nFacing a real-world scenario as described above, we engineer the Monte-Carlo\ntree-search for finding a close-to-optimum ordering of jobs. To cope with a\nlarge solutions-space in planning scenarios, a hierarchical Monte-Carlo tree\nsearch (H-MCTS) is proposed based on abstraction of jobs. On synthetic and\nreal-life problems, H-MCTS with integrated abstraction significantly\noutperforms pure heuristic-based techniques as well as other Monte-Carlo search\nvariants. We furthermore show that, by modifying the evaluation metric in\nH-MCTS, it is possible to achieve other optimization objectives than what the\nscheduling heuristics are designed for -- e.g., minimizing the total completion\ntime instead of the makespan. Our experimental observations have been also\nvalidated in real-life cases, and our H-MCTS approach has been implemented in a\nproduction plant's controller.",

The gas mapping problem is formulated as a 3D factor graph of\nGaussian potentials, the connections of which are conditioned on local\noccupancy values. The Gaussian belief propagation framework is introduced as\nthe solver and a new hybrid message scheduler is introduced to increase the\nrate of convergence. The factor graph problem is then redesigned as a\ndynamically expanding inference task, coupling the information of consecutive\ngas measurements with local spatial structure obtained by the robot. The\nproposed algorithm is compared to the state of the art methods in 2D and 3D\nsimulations and is found to resolve distribution maps orders of magnitude\nquicker than typical direct solvers. The proposed framework is then deployed\nfor the first time onboard a ground robot in a 3D mapping and exploration task.\nThe system is shown to be able to resolve multiple sensor inputs and output\nhigh resolution 3D gas distribution maps in a GPS denied cluttered scenario in\nreal time.

The model is motivated by the need to\ncharacterize uncertainty in the input/output relationship when making\ninferences on new data. In particular, in the physical sciences, limited\ntraining data may not adequately characterize future observed data; it is\ncritical that models adequately indicate uncertainty, particularly when they\nmay be asked to extrapolate. In our proposed model, structured conditional\nnormalizing flows provide parsimonious latent representations that relate to\nthe inputs through a Gaussian process, providing exact likelihood calculations\nand uncertainty that naturally increases away from the training data inputs. We\ndemonstrate the methodology on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy data from\nthe ChemCam instrument onboard the Mars rover Curiosity.

In this paper, we present a systematic\ntechnique for the identification of significant features of test scenarios that\nimpact their effectiveness, based on Instance Space Analysis (ISA). ISA\nidentifies a combination of features that best differentiates safety-critical\nscenarios from normal driving scenarios and visualises the distribution of\nthese features with respect to test scenario outcome. The visualisation helps\nidentify the untested areas of the instance space where test scenarios are\nempirically possible, however, missing from the current test suite, which is an\nindicator of the quality of the test suite. We train four Machine Learning\napproaches to classify test scenarios as safety-critical or not. The high\nprecision, recall, and F1-scores indicate that the proposed approach is\neffective in predicting the outcome of a test scenario before simulating it,\nthus aiding with test scenario prioritization.",

Source data is assumed inaccessible due to proprietary or privacy\nreasons.

In this work, we propose to leverage an ImageNet pre-trained\nfeature extractor in a new co-learning framework to improve target pseudolabel\nquality for finetuning the source model. Benefits of the ImageNet feature\nextractor include that it is not source-biased and it provides an alternate\nview of features and classification decisions different from the source model.\nSuch pre-trained feature extractors are also publicly available, which allows\nus to readily leverage modern network architectures that have strong\nrepresentation learning ability.

    "abstract": "Due to the usefulness in data enrichment for data analysis tasks, joinable\ntable discovery has become an important operation in data lake management.\nExisting approaches target equi-joins, the most common way of combining tables\nfor creating a unified view, or semantic joins, which tolerate misspellings and\ndifferent formats to deliver more join results. They are either exact solutions\nwhose running time is linear in the sizes of query column and target table\nrepository or approximate solutions lacking precision. In this paper, we\npropose Deepjoin, a deep learning model for accurate and efficient joinable\ntable discovery. Our solution is an embedding-based retrieval, which employs a\npre-trained language model (PLM) and is designed as one framework serving both\nequi- and semantic joins. We propose a set of contextualization options to\ntransform column contents to a text sequence. The PLM reads the sequence and is\nfine-tuned to embed columns to vectors such that columns are expected to be\njoinable if they are close to each other in the vector space. Since the output\nof the PLM is fixed in length, the subsequent search procedure becomes\nindependent of the column size. With a state-of-the-art approximate nearest\nneighbor search algorithm, the search time is logarithmic in the repository\nsize. To train the model, we devise the techniques for preparing training data\nas well as data augmentation. The experiments on real datasets demonstrate that\nby training on a small subset of a corpus, Deepjoin generalizes to large\ndatasets and its precision consistently outperforms other approximate\nsolutions'. Deepjoin is even more accurate than an exact solution to semantic\njoins when evaluated with labels from experts. Moreover, when equipped with a\nGPU, Deepjoin is up to two orders of magnitude faster than existing solutions.",

In this paper, we present a novel weakly supervised framework with\n\\textbf{S}patio-\\textbf{T}emporal \\textbf{C}ollaboration for instance\n\\textbf{Seg}mentation in videos, namely \\textbf{STC-Seg}. Concretely, STC-Seg\ndemonstrates four contributions. First, we leverage the complementary\nrepresentations from unsupervised depth estimation and optical flow to produce\neffective pseudo-labels for training deep networks and predicting high-quality\ninstance masks. Second, to enhance the mask generation, we devise a puzzle\nloss, which enables end-to-end training using box-level annotations. Third, our\ntracking module jointly utilizes bounding-box diagonal points with\nspatio-temporal discrepancy to model movements, which largely improves the\nrobustness to different object appearances. Finally, our framework is flexible\nand enables image-level instance segmentation methods to operate the\nvideo-level task. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on the KITTI MOTS\nand YT-VIS datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves\nstrong performance and even outperforms fully supervised TrackR-CNN and\nMaskTrack R-CNN.

It cumulatively collects intermediate queries as decoding stages go\ndeeper and selectively forwards the queries to the downstream stages aside from\nthe sequential structure. Such-wise, SQR places training emphasis on later\nstages and allows later stages to work with intermediate queries from earlier\nstages directly. SQR can be easily plugged into various query-based object\ndetectors and significantly enhances their performance while leaving the\ninference pipeline unchanged.

    "abstract": "Gaussian process state-space model (GPSSM) is a fully probabilistic\nstate-space model that has attracted much attention over the past decade.\nHowever, the outputs of the transition function in the existing GPSSMs are\nassumed to be independent, meaning that the GPSSMs cannot exploit the inductive\nbiases between different outputs and lose certain model capacities. To address\nthis issue, this paper proposes an output-dependent and more realistic GPSSM by\nutilizing the well-known, simple yet practical linear model of\ncoregionalization (LMC) framework to represent the output dependency. To\njointly learn the output-dependent GPSSM and infer the latent states, we\npropose a variational sparse GP-based learning method that only gently\nincreases the computational complexity. Experiments on both synthetic and real\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of the output-dependent GPSSM in terms of\nlearning and inference performance.",

This paper outlines an active driver assistance approach that\nuses a residual policy learning (RPL) agent trained to provide residual actions\nto default power train controllers while balancing fuel consumption against\nother driver-accommodation objectives. Using previous experiences, our RPL\nagent learns improved traction torque and gear shifting residual policies to\nadapt the operation of the powertrain to variations and uncertainties in the\nenvironment. For comparison, we consider a traditional reinforcement learning\n(RL) agent trained from scratch.

By\nimplementing on a simulated commercial vehicle in various car-following\nscenarios, we find that the RPL agent quickly learns significantly improved\npolicies compared to a baseline source policy but in some measures not as good\nas those eventually possible with the RL agent trained from scratch.",

Existing\nmethods rely on the heavy SR models to enhance low-resolution (LR) images of\ndifferent degradation levels, which significantly restricts their practical\ndeployments on resource-limited devices. In this paper, we propose a novel\nDynamic Channel Splitting scheme for efficient Real-world Image\nSuper-Resolution, termed DCS-RISR. Specifically, we first introduce the light\ndegradation prediction network to regress the degradation vector to simulate\nthe real-world degradations, upon which the channel splitting vector is\ngenerated as the input for an efficient SR model. Then, a learnable octave\nconvolution block is proposed to adaptively decide the channel splitting scale\nfor low- and high-frequency features at each block, reducing computation\noverhead and memory cost by offering the large scale to low-frequency features\nand the small scale to the high ones. To further improve the RISR performance,\nNon-local regularization is employed to supplement the knowledge of patches\nfrom LR and HR subspace with free-computation inference. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of DCS-RISR on different benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Adapting object detectors learned with sufficient supervision to novel\nclasses under low data regimes is charming yet challenging. In few-shot object\ndetection (FSOD), the two-step training paradigm is widely adopted to mitigate\nthe severe sample imbalance, i.e., holistic pre-training on base classes, then\npartial fine-tuning in a balanced setting with all classes. Since unlabeled\ninstances are suppressed as backgrounds in the base training phase, the learned\nRPN is prone to produce biased proposals for novel instances, resulting in\ndramatic performance degradation. Unfortunately, the extreme data scarcity\naggravates the proposal distribution bias, hindering the RoI head from evolving\ntoward novel classes. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective\nproposal distribution calibration (PDC) approach to neatly enhance the\nlocalization and classification abilities of the RoI head by recycling its\nlocalization ability endowed in base training and enriching high-quality\npositive samples for semantic fine-tuning. Specifically, we sample proposals\nbased on the base proposal statistics to calibrate the distribution bias and\nimpose additional localization and classification losses upon the sampled\nproposals for fast expanding the base detector to novel classes.

However, they feed the training pairs in a random\norder without consideration of difficulty. Without human annotation, the\ngenerated training pairs of self-supervised learning often contain noise. If\nnoisy or hard pairs are used for training at the easy stage, the model might be\nstuck in bad local optimum. In this paper, we inject curriculum learning into\nweakly supervised modality correlation learning. The weakly supervised\ncorrelation learning leverages the label information to generate scores for\nnegative pairs to learn a more discriminative embedding space, where negative\npairs are defined as two unimodal embeddings from different samples. To assist\nthe correlation learning, we feed the training pairs to the model according to\ndifficulty by the proposed curriculum learning, which consists of elaborately\ndesigned scoring and feeding functions. The scoring function computes the\ndifficulty of pairs using pre-trained and current correlation predictors, where\nthe pairs with large losses are defined as hard pairs. Notably, the hardest\npairs are discarded in our algorithm, which are assumed as noisy pairs.\nMoreover, the feeding function takes the difference of correlation losses as\nfeedback to determine the feeding actions (`stay', `step back', or `step\nforward').

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of Very High Resolution (VHR) remote sensing images is\na fundamental task for many applications. However, large variations in the\nscales of objects in those VHR images pose a challenge for performing accurate\nsemantic segmentation. Existing semantic segmentation networks are able to\nanalyse an input image at up to four resizing scales, but this may be\ninsufficient given the diversity of object scales. Therefore, Multi Scale (MS)\ntest-time data augmentation is often used in practice to obtain more accurate\nsegmentation results, which makes equal use of the segmentation results\nobtained at the different resizing scales. However, it was found in this study\nthat different classes of objects had their preferred resizing scale for more\naccurate semantic segmentation. Based on this behaviour, a Stacking-Based\nSemantic Segmentation (SBSS) framework is proposed to improve the segmentation\nresults by learning this behaviour, which contains a learnable Error Correction\nModule (ECM) for segmentation result fusion and an Error Correction Scheme\n(ECS) for computational complexity control. Two ECS, i.e., ECS-MS and ECS-SS,\nare proposed and investigated in this study. The Floating-point operations\n(Flops) required for ECS-MS and ECS-SS are similar to the commonly used MS test\nand the Single-Scale (SS) test, respectively. Extensive experiments on four\ndatasets (i.e., Cityscapes, UAVid, LoveDA and Potsdam) show that SBSS is an\neffective and flexible framework. It achieved higher accuracy than MS when\nusing ECS-MS, and similar accuracy as SS with a quarter of the memory footprint\nwhen using ECS-SS.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the use of evolutionary algorithms for solving\ndifferential equations. The solution is obtained by optimizing a deep neural\nnetwork whose loss function is defined by the residual terms from the\ndifferential equations. Recent studies have used stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) variants to train these physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), but\nthese methods can struggle to find accurate solutions due to optimization\nchallenges. When solving differential equations, it is important to find the\nglobally optimum parameters of the network, rather than just finding a solution\nthat works well during training. SGD only searches along a single gradient\ndirection, so it may not be the best approach for training PINNs with their\naccompanying complex optimization landscapes. In contrast, evolutionary\nalgorithms perform a parallel exploration of different solutions in order to\navoid getting stuck in local optima and can potentially find more accurate\nsolutions. However, evolutionary algorithms can be slow, which can make them\ndifficult to use in practice. To address this, we provide a set of five\nbenchmark problems with associated performance metrics and baseline results to\nsupport the development of evolutionary algorithms for enhanced PINN training.\nAs a baseline, we evaluate the performance and speed of using the widely\nadopted Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) for solving\nPINNs. We provide the loss and training time for CMA-ES run on TensorFlow, and\nCMA-ES and SGD run on JAX (with GPU acceleration) for the five benchmark\nproblems. Our results show that JAX-accelerated evolutionary algorithms,\nparticularly CMA-ES, can be a useful approach for solving differential\nequations.

The authors\nintroduce the complex rotated MCA (xMCA) to deal with lagged effects and\nnon-orthogonality of the feature representation. This method essentially (1)\ntransforms the signals to a complex plane with the Hilbert transform; (2)\napplies an oblique (Varimax and Promax) rotation to remove the orthogonality\nconstraint; and (3) performs the eigendecomposition in this complex space\n(Horel et al, 1984). We argue that this method is essentially a particular case\nof the method called rotated complex kernel principal component analysis\n(ROCK-PCA) introduced in (Bueso et al., 2019, 2020), where we proposed the same\napproach: first transform the data to the complex plane with the Hilbert\ntransform and then apply the varimax rotation, with the only difference that\nthe eigendecomposition is performed in the dual (kernel) Hilbert space. The\nlatter allows us to generalize the xMCA solution by extracting nonlinear\n(curvilinear) features when nonlinear kernel functions are used. Hence, the\nsolution of xMCA boils down to ROCK-PCA when the inner product is computed in\nthe input data space instead of in the high-dimensional (possibly infinite)\nkernel Hilbert space to which data has been mapped. In this short\ncorrespondence we show theoretical proof that xMCA is a special case of\nROCK-PCA and provide quantitative evidence that more expressive and informative\nfeatures can be extracted when working with kernels; results of the\ndecomposition of global sea surface temperature (SST) fields are shown to\nillustrate the capabilities of ROCK-PCA to cope with nonlinear processes,\nunlike xMCA.",

    "abstract": "The detection of human body and its related parts (e.g., face, head or hands)\nhave been intensively studied and greatly improved since the breakthrough of\ndeep CNNs. However, most of these detectors are trained independently, making\nit a challenging task to associate detected body parts with people. This paper\nfocuses on the problem of joint detection of human body and its corresponding\nparts. Specifically, we propose a novel extended object representation that\nintegrates the center location offsets of body or its parts, and construct a\ndense single-stage anchor-based Body-Part Joint Detector (BPJDet). Body-part\nassociations in BPJDet are embedded into the unified representation which\ncontains both the semantic and geometric information. Therefore, BPJDet does\nnot suffer from error-prone association post-matching, and has a better\naccuracy-speed trade-off. Furthermore, BPJDet can be seamlessly generalized to\njointly detect any body part. To verify the effectiveness and superiority of\nour method, we conduct extensive experiments on the CityPersons, CrowdHuman and\nBodyHands datasets. The proposed BPJDet detector achieves state-of-the-art\nassociation performance on these three benchmarks while maintains high accuracy\nof detection. Code will be released to facilitate further studies.",

The diversion pipeline is an enclosed space, so the\nairflow disturbance caused by the rotation of the UAV blades and the strong air\nconvection from the chimney effect have a great impact on the flight control of\nthe UAV. Although the traditional linear control PID flight control algorithm\nhas been widely used and can meet the requirements of general flight tasks, it\ncannot guarantee the stability of the system over a wide range. The inspection\nof a diversion line in an enclosed space requires high system stability and\nrobustness of the UAV controller. In this paper, a hybrid stabilised adaptive\nbackstepping control method is proposed. Firstly, a multi-rotor UAV model is\nanalysed and transformed into a strict feedback form with external\ndisturbances; then adaptive techniques are used to estimate the airflow\ndisturbances caused by the blades, and the attitude and position tracking\ncontrollers are designed by combining backstepping control and PID control\nrespectively; finally, the asymptotic stability of the system is ensured by\nconstructing a Lyapunov function. The experimental data show that the flight\ncontroller designed in this paper has good robustness and tracking performance,\nand can better resist the disturbance caused by airflow disturbance in confined\nspace.",

    "abstract": "The polynomial kernels are widely used in machine learning and they are one\nof the default choices to develop kernel-based classification and regression\nmodels. However, they are rarely used and considered in numerical analysis due\nto their lack of strict positive definiteness. In particular they do not enjoy\nthe usual property of unisolvency for arbitrary point sets, which is one of the\nkey properties used to build kernel-based interpolation methods. This paper is\ndevoted to establish some initial results for the study of these kernels, and\ntheir related interpolation algorithms, in the context of approximation theory.\nWe will first prove necessary and sufficient conditions on point sets which\nguarantee the existence and uniqueness of an interpolant. We will then study\nthe Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (or native spaces) of these kernels and\ntheir norms, and provide inclusion relations between spaces corresponding to\ndifferent kernel parameters. With these spaces at hand, it will be further\npossible to derive generic error estimates which apply to sufficiently smooth\nfunctions, thus escaping the native space. Finally, we will show how to employ\nan efficient stable algorithm to these kernels to obtain accurate interpolants,\nand we will test them in some numerical experiment. After this analysis several\ncomputational and theoretical aspects remain open, and we will outline possible\nfurther research directions in a concluding section.

The stochastic variant of the lemma is applicable to a large\nclass of linear dynamics subject to stochastic disturbances of Gaussian and\nnon-Gaussian nature.

    "abstract": "Tomorrow's massive-scale IoT sensor networks are poised to drive uplink\ntraffic demand, especially in areas of dense deployment. To meet this demand,\nhowever, network designers leverage tools that often require accurate estimates\nof Channel State Information (CSI), which incurs a high overhead and thus\nreduces network throughput. Furthermore, the overhead generally scales with the\nnumber of clients, and so is of special concern in such massive IoT sensor\nnetworks. While prior work has used transmissions over one frequency band to\npredict the channel of another frequency band on the same link, this paper\ntakes the next step in the effort to reduce CSI overhead: predict the CSI of a\nnearby but distinct link. We propose Cross-Link Channel Prediction (CLCP), a\ntechnique that leverages multi-view representation learning to predict the\nchannel response of a large number of users, thereby reducing channel\nestimation overhead further than previously possible. CLCP's design is highly\npractical, exploiting channel estimates obtained from existing transmissions\ninstead of dedicated channel sounding or extra pilot signals. We have\nimplemented CLCP for two different Wi-Fi versions, namely 802.11n and 802.11ax,\nthe latter being the leading candidate for future IoT networks. We evaluate\nCLCP in two large-scale indoor scenarios involving both line-of-sight and\nnon-line-of-sight transmissions with up to 144 different 802.11ax users.\nMoreover, we measure its performance with four different channel bandwidths,\nfrom 20 MHz up to 160 MHz. Our results show that CLCP provides a 2x throughput\ngain over baseline 802.11ax and a 30 percent throughput gain over existing\ncross-band prediction algorithms.",

    "abstract": "An enhanced geothermal system is essential to provide sustainable and\nlong-term geothermal energy supplies and reduce carbon emissions. Optimal\nwell-control scheme for effective heat extraction and improved heat sweep\nefficiency plays a significant role in geothermal development. However, the\noptimization performance of most existing optimization algorithms deteriorates\nas dimension increases. To solve this issue, a novel surrogate-assisted\nlevel-based learning evolutionary search algorithm (SLLES) is proposed for heat\nextraction optimization of enhanced geothermal system. SLLES consists of\nclassifier-assisted level-based learning pre-screen part and local evolutionary\nsearch part. The cooperation of the two parts has realized the balance between\nthe exploration and exploitation during the optimization process. After\niteratively sampling from the design space, the robustness and effectiveness of\nthe algorithm are proven to be improved significantly. To the best of our\nknowledge, the proposed algorithm holds state-of-the-art simulation-involved\noptimization framework. Comparative experiments have been conducted on\nbenchmark functions, a two-dimensional fractured reservoir and a\nthree-dimensional enhanced geothermal system. The proposed algorithm\noutperforms other five state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted algorithms on all\nselected benchmark functions. The results on the two heat extraction cases also\ndemonstrate that SLLES can achieve superior optimization performance compared\nwith traditional evolutionary algorithm and other surrogate-assisted\nalgorithms. This work lays a solid basis for efficient geothermal extraction of\nenhanced geothermal system and sheds light on the model management strategies\nof data-driven optimization in the areas of energy exploitation.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have become the state-of-the-art neural network architecture\nacross numerous domains of machine learning. This is partly due to their\ncelebrated ability to transfer and to learn in-context based on few examples.\nNevertheless, the mechanisms by which Transformers become in-context learners\nare not well understood and remain mostly an intuition. Here, we argue that\ntraining Transformers on auto-regressive tasks can be closely related to\nwell-known gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a\nsimple weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations\ninduced by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent\n(GD) on a regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically\nthat when training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks\neither the models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or,\nremarkably, the weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we\nshow how trained Transformers implement gradient descent in their forward pass.\nThis allows us, at least in the domain of regression problems, to\nmechanistically understand the inner workings of optimized Transformers that\nlearn in-context. Furthermore, we identify how Transformers surpass plain\ngradient descent by an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models\non deep data representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we\ndiscuss intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for\nin-context learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it\ncould be understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient\ndescent learning within Transformers.",

    "abstract": "Events deviating from normal traffic patterns in driving, anomalies, such as\naggressive driving or bumpy roads, may harm delivery efficiency for\ntransportation and logistics (T&L) business. Thus, detecting anomalies in\ndriving is critical for the T&L industry. So far numerous researches have used\nvehicle sensor data to identify anomalies. Most previous works captured\nanomalies by using deep learning or machine learning algorithms, which require\nprior training processes and huge computational costs. This study proposes a\nmethod namely Anomaly Detection in Driving by Cluster Analysis Twice (ADDCAT)\nwhich clusters the processed sensor data in different physical properties. An\nevent is said to be an anomaly if it never fits with the major cluster, which\nis considered as the pattern of normality in driving. This method provides a\nway to detect anomalies in driving with no prior training processes and huge\ncomputational costs needed. This paper validated the performance of the method\non an open dataset.",

To address this, we present\nVocabulary Disentanglement Retrieval~(VDR), a simple yet effective\nretrieval-based disentanglement framework that leverages nature language as\ndistant supervision. Our approach is built upon the widely-used bi-encoder\narchitecture with disentanglement heads and is trained on data-text pairs that\nare readily available on the web or in existing datasets.

We conduct experiments on 16 datasets in both\ntext-to-text and cross-modal scenarios and evaluate VDR in a zero-shot setting.\nWith the incorporation of disentanglement heads and a minor increase in\nparameters, VDR achieves significant improvements over the base retriever it is\nbuilt upon, with a 9% higher on NDCG@10 scores in zero-shot text-to-text\nretrieval and an average of 13% higher recall in cross-modal retrieval.

Second, we consider\nthree complementary agent traits suggested by significant sociological and\npsychological research: conformism, radicalism and stubbornness. We rely on\nWorld Values Survey data to show that the proposed model has the potential to\npredict the evolution of opinions in real life: the classification-based\napproach and complementary agent traits produce rich collective behaviours,\nsuch as polarisation, consensus, and clustering, which can yield predicted\nopinions similar to survey results.",

Recently, a\nconnection between linear Gaussian Bayesian inference problems and the system\ntheoretic concept of balanced truncation was drawn for the first time.

In this paper, the link between system theory and data\nassimilation is further strengthened by discussing the application of balanced\ntruncation to standard linear Gaussian Bayesian inference, and, in particular,\nthe 4D-Var method. Similarities between both data assimilation problems allow a\ndiscussion of established methods as well as a generalisation of the\nstate-of-the-art approach to arbitrary prior covariances as reachability\nGramians.

    "abstract": "A path query extracts vertex tuples from a labeled graph, based on the words\nthat are formed by the paths connecting the vertices. We study the\ncomputational complexity of measuring the contribution of edges and vertices to\nan answer to a path query, focusing on the class of conjunctive regular path\nqueries. To measure this contribution, we adopt the traditional Shapley value\nfrom cooperative game theory. This value has been recently proposed and studied\nin the context of relational database queries and has uses in a plethora of\nother domains.\nWe first study the contribution of edges and show that the exact Shapley\nvalue is almost always hard to compute. Specifically, it is #P-hard to\ncalculate the contribution of an edge whenever at least one (non-redundant)\nconjunct allows for a word of length three or more. In the case of regular path\nqueries (i.e., no conjunction), the problem is tractable if the query has only\nwords of length at most two; hence, this property fully characterizes the\ntractability of the problem. On the other hand, if we allow for an\napproximation error, then it is straightforward to obtain an efficient scheme\n(FPRAS) for an additive approximation. Yet, a multiplicative approximation is\nharder to obtain. We establish that in the case of conjunctive regular path\nqueries, a multiplicative approximation of the Shapley value of an edge can be\ncomputed in polynomial time if and only if all query atoms are finite languages\n(assuming non-redundancy and conventional complexity limitations). We also\nstudy the analogous situation where we wish to determine the contribution of a\nvertex, rather than an edge, and establish complexity results of similar\nnature.",

An emerging technology that has the\npotential to substantially increase the effectiveness of the multifaceted and\ninterconnected port processes is that of digital twins. Innovation-leading\nports recognizing the potential of twinning have already started working on it.\nHowever, since there is no clear consensus on what a digital twin of a complex\nsystem comprises and how it should be designed, deployed digital twin solutions\nfor ports often differ significantly. This article addresses this issue by\ninitially identifying three core aspect underpinning digital twins of complex\nsystems, such as ports, and outlining five successive maturity levels based on\nthese aspects' instantiation. These identified aspects and the derived maturity\nlevels are then used to examine real-world cases by critically evaluating\nexisting digital twinning solutions in the port of Singapore, the Mawan port of\nShanghai, and that of Rotterdam. These being three of the world's\ninnovation-leading ports, we naturally find in them most of the identified core\naspects to be in line with their twinning implementation, which has reached, in\nall three, a higher level of maturity. Although, our work on maturity levels\nand core aspects can provide a guideline for designing and benchmarking future\ndigital twinning solutions for ports, the capacity for innovation via twinning,\neven in the port domain, is highly contextual with key paragon being the\navailability of financial and technical resources.",

    "abstract": "The identification of material parameters occurring in constitutive models\nhas a wide range of applications in practice. One of these applications is the\nmonitoring and assessment of the actual condition of infrastructure buildings,\nas the material parameters directly reflect the resistance of the structures to\nexternal impacts. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently\nemerged as a suitable method for solving inverse problems. The advantages of\nthis method are a straightforward inclusion of observation data. Unlike\ngrid-based methods, such as the finite element method updating (FEMU) approach,\nno computational grid and no interpolation of the data is required. In the\ncurrent work, we aim to further develop PINNs towards the calibration of the\nlinear-elastic constitutive model from full-field displacement and global force\ndata in a realistic regime. We show that normalization and conditioning of the\noptimization problem play a crucial role in this process. Therefore, among\nothers, we identify the material parameters for initial estimates and balance\nthe individual terms in the loss function. In order to reduce the dependence of\nthe identified material parameters on local errors in the displacement\napproximation, we base the identification not on the stress boundary conditions\nbut instead on the global balance of internal and external work. In addition,\nwe found that we get a better posed inverse problem if we reformulate it in\nterms of bulk and shear modulus instead of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio.\nWe demonstrate that the enhanced PINNs are capable of identifying material\nparameters from both experimental one-dimensional data and synthetic full-field\ndisplacement data in a realistic regime.

In this paper, a novel quantum sensing (Ghost Imaging\n(GI)) based beam training is proposed for Simultaneously Transmitting and\nReflecting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (STAR RIS) aided THz multi-user\nmassive MIMO systems. We first conduct GI by surrounding 5G downlink signals to\nobtain 3D images of the environment including users and obstacles. Based on the\ninformation, we calculate the optimal position of the UAV-mounted STAR by the\nproposed algorithm. Thus the position-based beam training can be performed. To\nenhance the beam-forming gain, we further combine with channel estimation and\npropose a semi-passive structure of the STAR and ambiguity elimination scheme\nfor separated channel estimation. Thus the ambiguity in cascaded channel\nestimation, which may affect optimal passive beamforming, is avoided. The\noptimal active and passive beamforming are then carried out and data\ntransmission is initiated. The proposed BS sub-array and sub-STAR spatial\nmultiplexing architecture, optimal active and passive beamforming, digital\nprecoding, and optimal position of the UAV- mounted STAR are investigated\njointly to maximize the average achievable sum rate of the users. Moreover, the\ncloud radio access networks (CRAN) structured 5G downlink signal is proposed\nfor GI with enhanced resolution.

Such simulations are\ncomputationally expensive and, often, the time taken for one single computation\nis large and does not permit parametric studies. The aim of this work is\ntherefore to facilitate real-time and multi-query calculations by employing a\nnon-intrusive Reduced Order Method (ROM).\nWe propose a deep learning-based (DL) ROM scheme able to deal with fast\ntransient dynamics. In the case of blast waves, the parametrised PDEs are\ntime-dependent and non-linear. For such problems, the Proper Orthogonal\nDecomposition (POD), which relies on a linear superposition of modes, cannot\napproximate the solutions efficiently. The piecewise POD-DL scheme developed\nhere is a local ROM based on time-domain partitioning and a first\ndimensionality reduction obtained through the POD. Autoencoders are used as a\nsecond and non-linear dimensionality reduction. The latent space obtained is\nthen reconstructed from the time and parameter space through deep forward\nneural networks. The proposed scheme is applied to an example consisting of a\nblast wave propagating in air and impacting on the outside of a building.

The UK\nCOVID-19 Vocal Audio Dataset represents the largest collection of SARS-CoV-2\nPCR-referenced audio recordings to date. PCR results were linked to 70,794 of\n72,999 participants and 24,155 of 25,776 positive cases. Respiratory symptoms\nwere reported by 45.62% of participants. This dataset has additional potential\nuses for bioacoustics research, with 11.30% participants reporting asthma, and\n27.20% with linked influenza PCR test results.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has recently emerged as an appealing alternative\nfor legged locomotion over multiple terrains by training a policy in physical\nsimulation and then transferring it to the real world (i.e., sim-to-real\ntransfer). Despite considerable progress, the capacity and scalability of\ntraditional neural networks are still limited, which may hinder their\napplications in more complex environments. In contrast, the Transformer\narchitecture has shown its superiority in a wide range of large-scale sequence\nmodeling tasks, including natural language processing and decision-making\nproblems. In this paper, we propose Terrain Transformer (TERT), a high-capacity\nTransformer model for quadrupedal locomotion control on various terrains.\nFurthermore, to better leverage Transformer in sim-to-real scenarios, we\npresent a novel two-stage training framework consisting of an offline\npretraining stage and an online correction stage, which can naturally integrate\nTransformer with privileged training. Extensive experiments in simulation\ndemonstrate that TERT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on different\nterrains in terms of return, energy consumption and control smoothness. In\nfurther real-world validation, TERT successfully traverses nine challenging\nterrains, including sand pit and stair down, which can not be accomplished by\nstrong baselines.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models are being increasingly applied to imbalanced data in\nhigh stakes fields such as medicine, autonomous driving, and intelligence\nanalysis. Imbalanced data compounds the black-box nature of deep networks\nbecause the relationships between classes may be highly skewed and unclear.\nThis can reduce trust by model users and hamper the progress of developers of\nimbalanced learning algorithms. Existing methods that investigate imbalanced\ndata complexity are geared toward binary classification, shallow learning\nmodels and low dimensional data. In addition, current eXplainable Artificial\nIntelligence (XAI) techniques mainly focus on converting opaque deep learning\nmodels into simpler models (e.g., decision trees) or mapping predictions for\nspecific instances to inputs, instead of examining global data properties and\ncomplexities. Therefore, there is a need for a framework that is tailored to\nmodern deep networks, that incorporates large, high dimensional, multi-class\ndatasets, and uncovers data complexities commonly found in imbalanced data\n(e.g., class overlap, sub-concepts, and outlier instances). We propose a set of\ntechniques that can be used by both deep learning model users to identify,\nvisualize and understand class prototypes, sub-concepts and outlier instances;\nand by imbalanced learning algorithm developers to detect features and class\nexemplars that are key to model performance. Our framework also identifies\ninstances that reside on the border of class decision boundaries, which can\ncarry highly discriminative information. Unlike many existing XAI techniques\nwhich map model decisions to gray-scale pixel locations, we use saliency\nthrough back-propagation to identify and aggregate image color bands across\nentire classes.

    "abstract": "Recognition of facial expression is a challenge when it comes to computer\nvision. The primary reasons are class imbalance due to data collection and\nuncertainty due to inherent noise such as fuzzy facial expressions and\ninconsistent labels. However, current research has focused either on the\nproblem of class imbalance or on the problem of uncertainty, ignoring the\nintersection of how to address these two problems. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose a framework based on Resnet and Attention to solve the above problems.\nWe design weight for each class. Through the penalty mechanism, our model will\npay more attention to the learning of small samples during training, and the\nresulting decrease in model accuracy can be improved by a Convolutional Block\nAttention Module (CBAM). Meanwhile, our backbone network will also learn an\nuncertain feature for each sample. By mixing uncertain features between\nsamples, the model can better learn those features that can be used for\nclassification, thus suppressing uncertainty. Experiments show that our method\nsurpasses most basic methods in terms of accuracy on facial expression data\nsets (e.g., AffectNet, RAF-DB), and it also solves the problem of class\nimbalance well.",

    "abstract": "Programmers' mental models represent their knowledge and understanding of\nprograms, programming concepts, and programming in general. They guide\nprogrammers' work and influence their task performance. Understanding mental\nmodels is important for designing work systems and practices that support\nprogrammers. Although the importance of programmers' mental models is widely\nacknowledged, research on mental models has decreased over the years. The\nresults are scattered and do not take into account recent developments in\nsoftware engineering. We analyze the state of research into programmers' mental\nmodels and provide an overview of existing research. We connect results on\nmental models from different strands of research to form a more unified\nknowledge base on the topic. We conducted a systematic literature review on\nprogrammers' mental models. We analyzed literature addressing mental models in\ndifferent contexts, including mental models of programs, programming tasks, and\nprogramming concepts. Using nine search engines, we found 3678 articles\n(excluding duplicates). 84 were selected for further analysis. Using the\nsnowballing technique, we obtained a final result set containing 187 articles.\nWe show that the literature shares a kernel of shared understanding of mental\nmodels. By collating and connecting results on mental models from different\nfields of research, we uncovered some well-researched aspects, which we argue\nare fundamental characteristics of programmers' mental models. This work\nprovides a basis for future work on mental models. The research field on\nprogrammers' mental models still faces many challenges rising from a lack of a\nshared knowledge base and poorly defined constructs. We created a unified\nknowledge base on the topic. We also point to directions for future studies. In\nparticular, we call for studies that examine programmers working with modern\npractices and tools.",

    "abstract": "Curative or remedial actions are the set of immediate actions intended to\nbring the power grid to a safe operating point after a contingency. The proper\nfunctioning of these actions is essential to enable curative N-1 security.\nNowadays, curative actions are derived ahead of time, based on the anticipated\nfuture grid state. Due to the shift from steady to volatile energy resources,\nthe grid state will frequently change and the curative actions would need to be\npre-planned increasingly often. Instead of pre-planning, we propose to\ncalculate curative actions in real-time after the occurrence of a contingency.\nFurthermore, with the shift from large bulk production to many small\ndecentralized energy sources more devices need to be actuated to achieve the\nsame outcome. This makes deriving curative actions more complex and therefore\nneeds to be automated. Overall, this motivates us to derive curative actions in\nreal-time using a method that is capable of the increasing complexity of the\navailable curative actions. We show how the method of Online Feedback\nOptimization (OFO) can be used to derive curative actions in real-time in the\nform of a closed-loop controller. As a preliminary demonstration of these\ncapabilities, we use an OFO controller that after a fault reduces the voltage\ndifference over a breaker to enable the operators to reclose it. This test case\nis inspired by the 2003 Swiss-Italian blackout, which was caused by a\nrelatively minor incident followed by ineffective curative actions. Finally, we\nidentify and discuss some open questions that need to be addressed in order to\nuse (OFO) to derive curative actions in real-time.

Their learned\ncounterparts are more repeatable and can handle challenging images, but at the\ncost of a lower accuracy and a bias towards wireframe lines.

Our new line segment detector, DeepLSD, processes images\nwith a deep network to generate a line attraction field, before converting it\nto a surrogate image gradient magnitude and angle, which is then fed to any\nexisting handcrafted line detector. Additionally, we propose a new optimization\ntool to refine line segments based on the attraction field and vanishing\npoints.

In this work, a new and detailed\ncalculation of the neutron flux for energies above 50 MeV is presented. This\nhas been done by using state-of-the-art Monte Carlo astroparticle techniques\nand including real atmospheric profiles at each one of the next 23 exascale\nsupercomputing facilities. Atmospheric impact in the flux and seasonal\nvariations were observed and characterised, and the barometric coefficient for\nhigh-energy neutrons at each site was obtained. With these coefficients,\npotential risks of errors associated with the increase in the flux of energetic\nneutrons, such as the occurrence of single event upsets or transients, and the\ncorresponding failure-in-time rates, can be anticipated just by using the\natmospheric pressure before the assignation of resources to critical tasks at\neach exascale facility. For more clarity, examples about how the rate of\nfailures is affected by the cosmic rays are included, so administrators will\nbetter anticipate which more or less restrictive actions could take for\novercoming errors.",

    "abstract": "Time series, sets of sequences in chronological order, are essential data in\nstatistical research with many forecasting applications. Although recent\nperformance in many Transformer-based models has been noticeable, long\nmulti-horizon time series forecasting remains a very challenging task. Going\nbeyond transformers in sequence translation and transduction research, we\nobserve the effects of down-and-up samplings that can nudge temporal saliency\npatterns to emerge in time sequences. Motivated by the mentioned observation,\nin this paper, we propose a novel architecture, Temporal Saliency Detection\n(TSD), on top of the attention mechanism and apply it to multi-horizon time\nseries prediction. We renovate the traditional encoder-decoder architecture by\nmaking as a series of deep convolutional blocks to work in tandem with the\nmulti-head self-attention. The proposed TSD approach facilitates the\nmultiresolution of saliency patterns upon condensed multi-heads, thus\nprogressively enhancing complex time series forecasting. Experimental results\nillustrate that our proposed approach has significantly outperformed existing\nstate-of-the-art methods across multiple standard benchmark datasets in many\nfar-horizon forecasting settings. Overall, TSD achieves 31% and 46% relative\nimprovement over the current state-of-the-art models in multivariate and\nunivariate time series forecasting scenarios on standard benchmarks.

A well-calibrated AI model is one that can reliably\nquantify the uncertainty of its decisions, assigning high confidence levels to\ndecisions that are likely to be correct and low confidence levels to decisions\nthat are likely to be erroneous. This paper investigates the application of\nconformal prediction as a general framework to obtain AI models that produce\ndecisions with formal calibration guarantees. Conformal prediction transforms\nprobabilistic predictors into set predictors that are guaranteed to contain the\ncorrect answer with a probability chosen by the designer. Such formal\ncalibration guarantees hold irrespective of the true, unknown, distribution\nunderlying the generation of the variables of interest, and can be defined in\nterms of ensemble or time-averaged probabilities.

    "abstract": "Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is more interesting and challenging than\nprinted text due to uneven variations in the handwriting style of the writers,\ncontent, and time. HTR becomes more challenging for the Indic languages because\nof (i) multiple characters combined to form conjuncts which increase the number\nof characters of respective languages, and (ii) near to 100 unique basic\nUnicode characters in each Indic script. Recently, many recognition methods\nbased on the encoder-decoder framework have been proposed to handle such\nproblems. They still face many challenges, such as image blur and incomplete\ncharacters due to varying writing styles and ink density. We argue that most\nencoder-decoder methods are based on local visual features without explicit\nglobal semantic information.\nIn this work, we enhance the performance of Indic handwritten text\nrecognizers using global semantic information. We use a semantic module in an\nencoder-decoder framework for extracting global semantic information to\nrecognize the Indic handwritten texts. The semantic information is used in both\nthe encoder for supervision and the decoder for initialization. The semantic\ninformation is predicted from the word embedding of a pre-trained language\nmodel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on handwritten texts of ten Indic languages.",

In this paper, we focus on the\nenumerative and asymptotic combinatorics of all these objects, giving formulas\nfor their numbers and describing their typical behavior (rather than the\nbehavior of a single object).

Our results also show that\nself-orthogonal codes, despite being very sparse in the set of codes of the\nsame dimension over a large field, asymptotically behave quite similarly to a\ntypical, not necessarily self-orthogonal, code.

The images can then be used\nfor photography or visual computing tasks in a variety of applications, such as\npublic safety surveillance and autonomous driving. One can argue that since RAW\nimages contain all the captured information, the conversion of RAW to RGB using\nan ISP is not necessary for visual computing. In this paper, we propose a novel\n$\\rho$-Vision framework to perform high-level semantic understanding and\nlow-level compression using RAW images without the ISP subsystem used for\ndecades. Considering the scarcity of available RAW image datasets, we first\ndevelop an unpaired CycleR2R network based on unsupervised CycleGAN to train\nmodular unrolled ISP and inverse ISP (invISP) models using unpaired RAW and RGB\nimages. We can then flexibly generate simulated RAW images (simRAW) using any\nexisting RGB image dataset and finetune different models originally trained for\nthe RGB domain to process real-world camera RAW images. We demonstrate object\ndetection and image compression capabilities in RAW-domain using RAW-domain\nYOLOv3 and RAW image compressor (RIC) on snapshots from various cameras.\nQuantitative results reveal that RAW-domain task inference provides better\ndetection accuracy and compression compared to RGB-domain processing.\nFurthermore, the proposed \\r{ho}-Vision generalizes across various camera\nsensors and different task-specific models.

Subsequently, the detected data symbols are considered as\nvirtual pilots, and their CFRs are updated without additional pilot overhead.\nThereafter, the remaining channel estimation and equalization can be performed\nin a sliding manner. With this approach, we use multiple channel estimates to\nequalize the data at each subcarrier. This allows us to take advantage of\nfrequency diversity and improve the detection performance.

We consider arbitrary high order iterative schemes that gain one\norder of accuracy at each iteration and we modify them in order to match the\naccuracy achieved in a specific iteration with the discretization accuracy of\nthe same iteration. Apart from the computational advantage, the new modified\nmethods allow to naturally perform p-adaptivity, stopping the iterations when\nappropriate conditions are met.

To arrive at this conclusion, we introduce a new\ncompositionality evaluation benchmark CREPE which measures two important\naspects of compositionality identified by cognitive science literature:\nsystematicity and productivity. To measure systematicity, CREPE consists of\nthree test datasets. The three test sets are designed to test models trained on\nthree of the popular training datasets: CC-12M, YFCC-15M, and LAION-400M. They\ncontain 385K, 385K, and 373K image-text pairs and 237K, 210K, and 178K hard\nnegative captions.

The datasets are generated by repurposing the\nVisual Genome scene graphs and region descriptions and applying handcrafted\ntemplates and GPT-3. For systematicity, we find that model performance\ndecreases consistently when novel compositions dominate the retrieval set, with\nRecall@1 dropping by up to 8%.

    "title": "Do altmetric scores reflect article quality? Evidence from the UK  Research Excellence Framework 2021",
    "abstract": "Altmetrics are web-based quantitative impact or attention indicators for\nacademic articles that have been proposed to supplement citation counts. This\narticle reports the first assessment of the extent to which mature altmetrics\nfrom Altmetric.com and Mendeley associate with journal article quality. It\nexploits expert norm-referenced peer review scores from the UK Research\nExcellence Framework 2021 for 67,030+ journal articles in all fields\n2014-17/18, split into 34 Units of Assessment (UoAs). The results show that\naltmetrics are better indicators of research quality than previously thought,\nalthough not as good as raw and field normalised Scopus citation counts.\nSurprisingly, field normalising citation counts can reduce their strength as a\nquality indicator for articles in a single field. For most UoAs, Mendeley\nreader counts are the best, tweet counts are also a relatively strong indicator\nin many fields, and Facebook, blogs and news citations are moderately strong\nindicators in some UoAs, at least in the UK. In general, altmetrics are the\nstrongest indicators of research quality in the health and physical sciences\nand weakest in the arts and humanities. The Altmetric Attention Score, although\nhybrid, is almost as good as Mendeley reader counts as a quality indicator and\nreflects more non-scholarly impacts.",

    "title": "Do bibliometrics introduce gender, institutional or interdisciplinary  biases into research evaluations?",
    "abstract": "Systematic evaluations of publicly funded research typically employ a\ncombination of bibliometrics and peer review, but it is not known whether the\nbibliometric component introduces biases. This article compares three\nalternative mechanisms for scoring 73,612 UK Research Excellence Framework\n(REF) journal articles from all 34 field-based Units of Assessment (UoAs)\n2014-17: peer review, field normalised citations, and journal average field\nnormalised citation impact. All three were standardised into a four-point\nscale. The results suggest that in almost all academic fields, bibliometric\nscoring can disadvantage departments publishing high quality research, with the\nmain exception of article citation rates in chemistry. Thus, introducing\njournal or article level citation information into peer review exercises may\nhave a regression to the mean effect. Bibliometric scoring slightly advantaged\nwomen compared to men, but this varied between UoAs and was most evident in the\nphysical sciences, engineering, and social sciences. In contrast,\ninterdisciplinary research gained from bibliometric scoring in about half of\nthe UoAs, but relatively substantially in two. In conclusion, out of the three\npotential source of bias examined, the most serious seems to be the tendency\nfor bibliometric scores to work against high quality departments, assuming that\nthe peer review scores are correct. This is almost a paradox: although high\nquality departments tend to get the highest bibliometric scores, bibliometrics\nconceal the full extent of departmental quality advantages. This should be\nconsidered when using bibliometrics or bibliometric informed peer review.",

    "abstract": "Despite their excellent performance, state-of-the-art computer vision models\noften fail when they encounter adversarial examples. Video perception models\ntend to be more fragile under attacks, because the adversary has more places to\nmanipulate in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we find one reason for\nvideo models' vulnerability is that they fail to perceive the correct motion\nunder adversarial perturbations. Inspired by the extensive evidence that motion\nis a key factor for the human visual system, we propose to correct what the\nmodel sees by restoring the perceived motion information. Since motion\ninformation is an intrinsic structure of the video data, recovering motion\nsignals can be done at inference time without any human annotation, which\nallows the model to adapt to unforeseen, worst-case inputs. Visualizations and\nempirical experiments on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets show that restoring\nmotion information in deep vision models improves adversarial robustness. Even\nunder adaptive attacks where the adversary knows our defense, our algorithm is\nstill effective. Our work provides new insight into robust video perception\nalgorithms by using intrinsic structures from the data. Our webpage is\navailable at https://motion4robust.cs.columbia.edu.",

    "abstract": "Compressing neural network architectures is important to allow the deployment\nof models to embedded or mobile devices, and pruning and quantization are the\nmajor approaches to compress neural networks nowadays. Both methods benefit\nwhen compression parameters are selected specifically for each layer. Finding\ngood combinations of compression parameters, so-called compression policies, is\nhard as the problem spans an exponentially large search space. Effective\ncompression policies consider the influence of the specific hardware\narchitecture on the used compression methods. We propose an algorithmic\nframework called Galen to search such policies using reinforcement learning\nutilizing pruning and quantization, thus providing automatic compression for\nneural networks. Contrary to other approaches we use inference latency measured\non the target hardware device as an optimization goal. With that, the framework\nsupports the compression of models specific to a given hardware target. We\nvalidate our approach using three different reinforcement learning agents for\npruning, quantization and joint pruning and quantization. Besides proving the\nfunctionality of our approach we were able to compress a ResNet18 for CIFAR-10,\non an embedded ARM processor, to 20% of the original inference latency without\nsignificant loss of accuracy. Moreover, we can demonstrate that a joint search\nand compression using pruning and quantization is superior to an individual\nsearch for policies using a single compression method.",

The aim of this\nresearch is to explore the use of data-driven models in measuring temperature\ndistributions in a spatially resolved manner using emission spectroscopy data.\nTwo categories of data-driven methods are analyzed: (i) Feature engineering and\nclassical machine learning algorithms, and (ii) end-to-end convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNN). In total, combinations of fifteen feature groups and fifteen\nclassical machine learning models, and eleven CNN models are considered and\ntheir performances explored. The results indicate that the combination of\nfeature engineering and machine learning provides better performance than the\ndirect use of CNN. Notably, feature engineering which is comprised of\nphysics-guided transformation, signal representation-based feature extraction\nand Principal Component Analysis is found to be the most effective.

    "abstract": "Dense retrieval aims to map queries and passages into low-dimensional vector\nspace for efficient similarity measuring, showing promising effectiveness in\nvarious large-scale retrieval tasks. Since most existing methods commonly adopt\npre-trained Transformers (e.g. BERT) for parameter initialization, some work\nfocuses on proposing new pre-training tasks for compressing the useful semantic\ninformation from passages into dense vectors, achieving remarkable\nperformances. However, it is still challenging to effectively capture the rich\nsemantic information and relations about passages into the dense vectors via\none single particular pre-training task. In this work, we propose a multi-task\npre-trained model, MASTER, that unifies and integrates multiple pre-training\ntasks with different learning objectives under the bottlenecked masked\nautoencoder architecture. Concretely, MASTER utilizes a multi-decoder\narchitecture to integrate three types of pre-training tasks: corrupted passages\nrecovering, related passage recovering and PLMs outputs recovering. By\nincorporating a shared deep encoder, we construct a representation bottleneck\nin our architecture, compressing the abundant semantic information across tasks\ninto dense vectors. The first two types of tasks concentrate on capturing the\nsemantic information of passages and relationships among them within the\npre-training corpus. The third one can capture the knowledge beyond the corpus\nfrom external PLMs (e.g. GPT-2). Extensive experiments on several large-scale\npassage retrieval datasets have shown that our approach outperforms the\nprevious state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods.

Moreover,\nwe demonstrate that these undesired correlations are transferred to the\ndownstream task for depression phenotype recognition. We find that data\naugmentation by simply swapping gender words mitigates the bias significantly\nin the downstream task.",

    "title": "QueryPose: Sparse Multi-Person Pose Regression via Spatial-Aware  Part-Level Query",
    "abstract": "We propose a sparse end-to-end multi-person pose regression framework, termed\nQueryPose, which can directly predict multi-person keypoint sequences from the\ninput image. The existing end-to-end methods rely on dense representations to\npreserve the spatial detail and structure for precise keypoint localization.\nHowever, the dense paradigm introduces complex and redundant post-processes\nduring inference. In our framework, each human instance is encoded by several\nlearnable spatial-aware part-level queries associated with an instance-level\nquery. First, we propose the Spatial Part Embedding Generation Module (SPEGM)\nthat considers the local spatial attention mechanism to generate several\nspatial-sensitive part embeddings, which contain spatial details and structural\ninformation for enhancing the part-level queries. Second, we introduce the\nSelective Iteration Module (SIM) to adaptively update the sparse part-level\nqueries via the generated spatial-sensitive part embeddings stage-by-stage.\nBased on the two proposed modules, the part-level queries are able to fully\nencode the spatial details and structural information for precise keypoint\nregression. With the bipartite matching, QueryPose avoids the hand-designed\npost-processes and surpasses the existing dense end-to-end methods with 73.6 AP\non MS COCO mini-val set and 72.7 AP on CrowdPose test set.

    "title": "Impact in informetrics and beyond",
    "abstract": "The concept of impact is one of the most important concepts in informetrics.\nIt is here studied mathematically. We first fix a topic for which we want to\nfind influential objects such as authors or journals, and their production,\nsuch as publications generating citations. These objects are then said to have\na certain degree of impact. We work on three levels. On the first level, we\nneed a measure for these objects, represented by their rank-frequency function,\ndescribing the number of items per source (ranked in decreasing order of the\nnumber of items): an impact measure. These measures focus on the production of\nthe most productive sources. The h-index is one example. In paper II we study a\nformal definition of impact measures based on these left-hand sides of the\nsource-item rank-frequency functions representing these objects. The second\nlevel of impact investigation is using impact bundles (or sheaves) as in paper\nIII. As an illustration, we mention that the h-index of a function Z is defined\nas x for which Z(x) = x, i.e., the abscissa of the intersection of the graph of\nZ with the line y = x. The h-bundle is defined in the same way but now the line\ny = x is replaced by an increasing line through the origin: y = $\\theta$.x,\n$\\theta$ > 0. So, we have a bundle of impact measures which is more powerful to\nmeasure the impact of an object Z. Impact bundles are characterized in paper\nIII. A third level of impact investigations involves the non-normalized form of\nthe Lorenz curve. In papers IV and V we study global impact measures as\nmeasures that respect the non-normalized Lorenz order between the\nrank-frequency functions representing objects Z. We say that object Z has more\nimpact than object Y if Y is smaller than Z in the sense of the non-normalized\nLorenz order. This is the highest level of impact treatment: a mathematical\ndefinition of the concept itself.",

    "abstract": "The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 dramatically reshaped the\nEuropean and global security landscape. In Finland, the invasion rapidly\noverturned the long-held policy of military non-alignment and led the country\nto apply for NATO membership, as a result of the largely converged public\nopinion on NATO that used to be polarized along the left-right axis. We\ninvestigate how this change took place among polarized actors on Finnish social\nmedia, and how the NATO discussion was depolarized by the external threat posed\nby Russia. By analyzing Twitter retweeting patterns, we find three\nwell-separated user groups before the invasion: a pro-NATO, a left-wing\nanti-NATO, and a conspiracy-charged anti-NATO group. Soon after the invasion,\nmembers of the left-wing anti-NATO group broke out of their retweeting bubble\nand established connections to the pro-NATO group despite their difference in\npartisanship, while the conspiracy-charged anti-NATO group mostly remained a\nseparate cluster. Our content analysis reveals that the left-wing anti-NATO\ngroup and the pro-NATO group were likely bridged by a shared condemnation of\nRussia's actions and shared democratic norms. Meanwhile, members of the other\nanti-NATO group, who built arguments mainly upon conspiracy theories,\ndisinformation, and Russian war propaganda, consistently demonstrated a clear\nanti-NATO attitude and retained strong within-group cohesion. Our findings show\nthat a dramatic external threat can bridge partisan divides in issues linked to\nthe threat, while groups upheld by conspiracy theories and disinformation more\nlikely persist.",

    "abstract": "Recent image degradation estimation methods have enabled single-image\nsuper-resolution (SR) approaches to better upsample real-world images. Among\nthese methods, explicit kernel estimation approaches have demonstrated\nunprecedented performance at handling unknown degradations. Nonetheless, a\nnumber of limitations constrain their efficacy when used by downstream SR\nmodels. Specifically, this family of methods yields i) excessive inference time\ndue to long per-image adaptation times and ii) inferior image fidelity due to\nkernel mismatch. In this work, we introduce a learning-to-learn approach that\nmeta-learns from the information contained in a distribution of images, thereby\nenabling significantly faster adaptation to new images with substantially\nimproved performance in both kernel estimation and image fidelity.\nSpecifically, we meta-train a kernel-generating GAN, named MetaKernelGAN, on a\nrange of tasks, such that when a new image is presented, the generator starts\nfrom an informed kernel estimate and the discriminator starts with a strong\ncapability to distinguish between patch distributions. Compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods, our experiments show that MetaKernelGAN better\nestimates the magnitude and covariance of the kernel, leading to\nstate-of-the-art blind SR results within a similar computational regime when\ncombined with a non-blind SR model. Through supervised learning of an\nunsupervised learner, our method maintains the generalizability of the\nunsupervised learner, improves the optimization stability of kernel estimation,\nand hence image adaptation, and leads to a faster inference with a speedup\nbetween 14.24 to 102.1x over existing methods.",

While by now there are many\npowerful machine learning (ML) tools for integrating different data modalities\ninto predictive models, this has rarely been approached so far from the\nperspective of uncovering the underlying, data-generating DS (aka DS\nreconstruction). Recently, sparse teacher forcing (TF) has been suggested as an\nefficient control-theoretic method for dealing with exploding loss gradients\nwhen training ML models on chaotic DS. Here we incorporate this idea into a\nnovel recurrent neural network (RNN) training framework for DS reconstruction\nbased on multimodal variational autoencoders (MVAE). The forcing signal for the\nRNN is generated by the MVAE which integrates different types of simultaneously\ngiven time series data into a joint latent code optimal for DS reconstruction.\nWe show that this training method achieves significantly better reconstructions\non multimodal datasets generated from chaotic DS benchmarks than various\nalternative methods.",

    "abstract": "Whilst the fifth-generation (5G) systems are being rolled out across the\nglobe, researchers have turned their attention to the exploration of radical\nnext-generation solutions. At this early evolutionary stage we survey five main\nresearch facets of this field, namely {\\em Facet~1: next-generation\narchitectures, spectrum and services, Facet~2: next-generation networking,\nFacet~3: Internet of Things (IoT), Facet~4: wireless positioning and sensing,\nas well as Facet~5: applications of deep learning in 6G networks.} In this\npaper, we have provided a critical appraisal of the literature of promising\ntechniques ranging from the associated architectures, networking, applications\nas well as designs. We have portrayed a plethora of heterogeneous architectures\nrelying on cooperative hybrid networks supported by diverse access and\ntransmission mechanisms. The vulnerabilities of these techniques are also\naddressed and carefully considered for highlighting the most of promising\nfuture research directions. Additionally, we have listed a rich suite of\nlearning-driven optimization techniques. We conclude by observing the\nevolutionary paradigm-shift that has taken place from pure single-component\nbandwidth-efficiency, power-efficiency or delay-optimization towards\nmulti-component designs, as exemplified by the twin-component ultra-reliable\nlow-latency mode of the 5G system. We advocate a further evolutionary step\ntowards multi-component Pareto optimization, which requires the exploration of\nthe entire Pareto front of all optiomal solutions, where none of the components\nof the objective function may be improved without degrading at least one of the\nother components.",

    "abstract": "Lenia is a family of cellular automata (CA) generalizing Conway's Game of\nLife to continuous space, time and states. Lenia has attracted a lot of\nattention because of the wide diversity of self-organizing patterns it can\ngenerate. Among those, some spatially localized patterns (SLPs) resemble\nlife-like artificial creatures. However, those creatures are found in only a\nsmall subspace of the Lenia parameter space and are not trivial to discover,\nnecessitating advanced search algorithms. We hypothesize that adding a mass\nconservation constraint could facilitate the emergence of SLPs. We propose here\nan extension of the Lenia model, called Flow Lenia, which enables mass\nconservation. We show a few observations demonstrating its effectiveness in\ngenerating SLPs with complex behaviors. Furthermore, we show how Flow Lenia\nenables the integration of the parameters of the CA update rules within the CA\ndynamics, making them dynamic and localized. This allows for multi-species\nsimulations, with locally coherent update rules that define properties of the\nemerging creatures, and that can be mixed with neighbouring rules. We argue\nthat this paves the way for the intrinsic evolution of self-organized\nartificial life forms within continuous CAs.",

We draw particular attention to\nextracting high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from video cameras as\ntraffic monitoring cameras are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. We explore\nmethods for automatic trajectory data reconciliation, given \"raw\" vehicle\ndetection and tracking information from automatic video processing algorithms.\nWe propose a pipeline including a) an online data association algorithm to\nmatch fragments that are associated to the same object (vehicle), which is\nformulated as a min-cost network flow problem of a graph, and b) a trajectory\nreconciliation method formulated as a quadratic program to enhance raw\ndetection data. The pipeline leverages vehicle dynamics and physical\nconstraints to associate tracked objects when they become fragmented, remove\nmeasurement noise on trajectories and impute missing data due to\nfragmentations. The accuracy is benchmarked on a sample of manually-labeled\ndata, which shows that the reconciled trajectories improve the accuracy on all\nthe tested input data for a wide range of measures.

Partially\nObservable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) offer a formal framework to solve\nthe underlying optimal planning task. However, two issues can undermine the\nPOMDP solutions. Firstly, the need for a model that can adequately describe the\nevolution of the structural condition under deterioration or corrective actions\nand, secondly, the non-trivial task of recovery of the observation process\nparameters from available monitoring data. Despite these potential challenges,\nthe adopted POMDP models do not typically account for uncertainty on model\nparameters, leading to solutions which can be unrealistically confident. In\nthis work, we address both key issues. We present a framework to estimate POMDP\ntransition and observation model parameters directly from available data, via\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)\nconditioned on actions. The MCMC inference estimates distributions of the\ninvolved model parameters.

To address these issues, we\npropose a novel visually-augmented fine-tuning approach that can be generally\napplied to various PLMs or NLP tasks, without using any retrieved or generated\nimages, namely VAWI.

Then, we adopt a fixed CLIP text encoder to generate the\nvisually-augmented representations of these VH-words. As it has been\npre-trained by vision-language alignment task on the large-scale corpus, it is\ncapable of injecting visual semantics into the aligned text representations.\nFinally, the visually-augmented features will be fused and transformed into the\npre-designed visual prompts based on VH-words, which can be inserted into PLMs\nto enrich the visual semantics in word representations.

To solve the latter problem, we derive a\nconvex relaxation, provide guidance on selecting the size of the robust region,\nand hence the regularization weighting parameter, based on the data, and\npropose an ADMM algorithm for implementation. We validate our method in an\nextensive simulation study.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) gained considerable attention by creating\ndecision-making agents that maximize rewards received from fully observable\nenvironments. However, many real-world problems are partially or noisily\nobservable by nature, where agents do not receive the true and complete state\nof the environment. Such problems are formulated as partially observable Markov\ndecision processes (POMDPs). Some studies applied RL to POMDPs by recalling\nprevious decisions and observations or inferring the true state of the\nenvironment from received observations. Nevertheless, aggregating observations\nand decisions over time is impractical for environments with high-dimensional\ncontinuous state and action spaces. Moreover, so-called inference-based RL\napproaches require large number of samples to perform well since agents eschew\nuncertainty in the inferred state for the decision-making. Active inference is\na framework that is naturally formulated in POMDPs and directs agents to select\ndecisions by minimising expected free energy (EFE). This supplies\nreward-maximising (exploitative) behaviour in RL, with an information-seeking\n(exploratory) behaviour. Despite this exploratory behaviour of active\ninference, its usage is limited to discrete state and action spaces due to the\ncomputational difficulty of the EFE. We propose a unified principle for joint\ninformation-seeking and reward maximization that clarifies a theoretical\nconnection between active inference and RL, unifies active inference and RL,\nand overcomes their aforementioned limitations. Our findings are supported by\nstrong theoretical analysis. The proposed framework's superior exploration\nproperty is also validated by experimental results on partial observable tasks\nwith high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. Moreover, the results\nshow that our model solves reward-free problems, making task reward design\noptional.",

A challenging topic\nin ISAC is the design of a single waveform combining both communication and\nsensing functionalities on the same time-frequency-space resources, allowing to\ntune the performance of both with partial or full hardware sharing. This paper\nproposes a dual-domain waveform design approach that superposes onto the\nfrequency-time (FT) domain both the legacy orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) signal and a sensing one, purposely designed in the\ndelay-Doppler domain. With a proper power downscaling of the sensing signal\nw.r.t.

The dual-domain ISAC waveform outperforms both\nOFDM and orthogonal time-frequency-space (OTFS) in terms of Cram\\'{e}r-Rao\nbound on delay estimation (up to 20 dB), thanks to its superior resolution,\nwith a negligible penalty on the achievable rate.",

XV is shared/social XR. We, and many others, use XR\n(eXtended Reality) as a broad umbrella term and concept to encompass all the\nother realities, where X is an ``anything'' variable, like in mathematics, to\ndenote any reality, X $\\in$ \\{physical, virtual, augmented, \\ldots \\} reality.\nTherefore XV inherits this generality from XR. We begin with a very simple\norganized taxonomy of all these realities in terms of two simple building\nblocks: (1) physical reality (PR) as made of ``atoms'', and (2) virtual reality\n(VR) as made of ``bits''. Next we introduce XV as combining all these realities\nwith extended society as a three-dimensional space and taxonomy of (1)\n``atoms'' (physical reality), (2) ``bits'' (virtuality), and (3) ``genes''\n(sociality). Thus those working in the liminal space between Virtual Reality\n(VR), Augmented Reality (AR), metaverse, and their various extensions, can\ndescribe their work and research as existing in the new field of XV.

    "abstract": "In heterogeneous networks (HetNets), the overlap of small cells and the macro\ncell causes severe cross-tier interference. Although there exist some\napproaches to address this problem, they usually require global channel state\ninformation, which is hard to obtain in practice, and get the sub-optimal power\nallocation policy with high computational complexity. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) based\npower control scheme for the HetNet, where each access point makes power\ncontrol decisions independently based on local information. To promote\ncooperation among agents, we develop a penalty-based Q learning (PQL) algorithm\nfor MADRL systems. By introducing regularization terms in the loss function,\neach agent tends to choose an experienced action with high reward when\nrevisiting a state, and thus the policy updating speed slows down. In this way,\nan agent's policy can be learned by other agents more easily, resulting in a\nmore efficient collaboration process. We then implement the proposed PQL in the\nconsidered HetNet and compare it with other distributed-training-and-execution\n(DTE) algorithms. Simulation results show that our proposed PQL can learn the\ndesired power control policy from a dynamic environment where the locations of\nusers change episodically and outperform existing DTE MADRL algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Regular expressions are used for diverse purposes, including input validation\nand firewalls. Unfortunately, they can also lead to a security vulnerability\ncalled ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service), caused by a super-linear\nworst-case execution time during regex matching. Due to the severity and\nprevalence of ReDoS, past work proposed automatic tools to detect and fix\nregexes. Although these tools were evaluated in automatic experiments, their\nusability has not yet been studied; usability has not been a focus of prior\nwork. Our insight is that the usability of existing tools to detect and fix\nregexes will improve if we complement them with anti-patterns and fix\nstrategies of vulnerable regexes. We developed novel anti-patterns for\nvulnerable regexes, and a collection of fix strategies to fix them. We derived\nour anti-patterns and fix strategies from a novel theory of regex infinite\nambiguity - a necessary condition for regexes vulnerable to ReDoS. We proved\nthe soundness and completeness of our theory. We evaluated the effectiveness of\nour anti-patterns, both in an automatic experiment and when applied manually.\nThen, we evaluated how much our anti-patterns and fix strategies improve\ndevelopers' understanding of the outcome of detection and fixing tools. Our\nevaluation found that our anti-patterns were effective over a large dataset of\nregexes (N=209,188): 100% precision and 99% recall, improving the state of the\nart 50% precision and 87% recall. Our anti-patterns were also more effective\nthan the state of the art when applied manually (N=20): 100% developers applied\nthem effectively vs. 50% for the state of the art. Finally, our anti-patterns\nand fix strategies increased developers' understanding using automatic tools\n(N=9): from median \"Very weakly\" to median \"Strongly\" when detecting\nvulnerabilities, and from median \"Very weakly\" to median \"Very strongly\" when\nfixing them.",

However, existing human\nevaluation protocols and benchmarks for summarization either exhibit low\ninter-annotator agreement or lack the scale needed to draw statistically\nsignificant conclusions, and an in-depth analysis of human evaluation is\nlacking. In this work, we address the shortcomings of existing summarization\nevaluation along the following axes: 1) We propose a modified summarization\nsalience protocol, Atomic Content Units (ACUs), which relies on fine-grained\nsemantic units and allows for high inter-annotator agreement. 2) We curate the\nRobust Summarization Evaluation (RoSE) benchmark, a large human evaluation\ndataset consisting of over 22k summary-level annotations over state-of-the-art\nsystems on three datasets. 3) We compare our ACU protocol with three other\nhuman evaluation protocols, underscoring potential confounding factors in\nevaluation setups. 4) We evaluate existing automatic metrics using the\ncollected human annotations across evaluation protocols and demonstrate how our\nbenchmark leads to more statistically stable and significant results.\nFurthermore, our findings have important implications for evaluating large\nlanguage models (LLMs), as we show that LLMs adjusted by human feedback (e.g.,\nGPT-3.5) may overfit unconstrained human evaluation, which is affected by the\nannotators' prior, input-agnostic preferences, calling for more robust,\ntargeted evaluation methods.",

    "abstract": "This work considers a Stokes flow in a deformable fracture interacting with a\nlinear elastic medium. To this end, we employ a phase-field model to\napproximate the crack dynamics. Phase-field methods belong to\ninterface-capturing approaches in which the interface is only given by a\nsmeared zone. For multi-domain problems, the accuracy of the coupling\nconditions is, however, of utmost importance. Here, interface-tracking methods\nare preferred. The key objective of this work is to construct a robust\nframework that computes first a crack path via the phase-field method\n(interface-capturing) and then does an interface-tracking reconstruction. We\nthen discuss several approaches to reconstruct the Eulerian description of the\nopen crack domain. This includes unfitted approaches where a level-set of the\ncrack interface is constructed and an approach where the geometry is re-meshed.\nUsing this reconstructed domain, we can compute the fluid-structure interaction\nproblem between the fluid in the crack and the interacting solid. With the\nexplicit mesh reconstruction of the two domains, we can then use an\ninterface-tracking Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) discretisation approach\nfor the resulting fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of releasing all pairs shortest path distances (APSD)\nin a weighted undirected graph with differential privacy (DP) guarantee. We\nconsider the weight-level privacy introduced by Sealfon [PODS'16], where the\ngraph topology is public but the edge weight is considered sensitive and\nprotected from inference via the released all pairs shortest distances. The\nprivacy guarantee ensures that the probability of differentiating two sets of\nedge weights on the same graph differing by an $\\ell_1$ norm of $1$ is bounded.\nThe goal is to minimize the additive error introduced to the released APSD\nwhile meeting the privacy guarantee. The best bounds known (Chen et al.\n[SODA'23]; Fan et al. [Arxiv'22]) is an $\\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ additive error for\n$\\varepsilon$-DP and an $\\tilde{O}(n^{1/2})$ additive error for $(\\varepsilon,\n\\delta)$-DP.\nIn this paper, we present new algorithms with improved additive error bounds:\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ for $\\varepsilon$-DP and $\\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ for\n$(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP, narrowing the gap with the current lower bound of\n$\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^{1/6})$ for $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP. The algorithms use\nnew ideas to carefully inject noises to a selective subset of shortest path\ndistances so as to control both `sensitivity' (the maximum number of times an\nedge is involved) and the number of these perturbed values needed to produce\neach of the APSD output. In addition, we also obtain, for $(\\varepsilon,\n\\delta)$-DP shortest distances on lines, trees and cycles, a lower bound of\n$\\Omega(\\log{n})$ for the additive error through a formulation by the matrix\nmechanism.",

    "abstract": "Security issues are threatened in various types of networks, especially in\nthe Internet of Things (IoT) environment that requires early detection. IoT is\nthe network of real-time devices like home automation systems and can be\ncontrolled by open-source android devices, which can be an open ground for\nattackers. Attackers can access the network, initiate a different kind of\nsecurity breach, and compromises network control. Therefore, timely detecting\nthe increasing number of sophisticated malware attacks is the challenge to\nensure the credibility of network protection. In this regard, we have developed\na new malware detection framework, Deep Squeezed-Boosted and Ensemble Learning\n(DSBEL), comprised of novel Squeezed-Boosted Boundary-Region\nSplit-Transform-Merge (SB-BR-STM) CNN and ensemble learning. The proposed\nS.T.M. block employs multi-path dilated convolutional, Boundary, and regional\noperations to capture the homogenous and heterogeneous global malicious\npatterns. Moreover, diverse feature maps are achieved using transfer learning\nand multi-path-based squeezing and boosting at initial and final levels to\nlearn minute pattern variations. Finally, the boosted discriminative features\nare extracted from the developed deep SB-BR-STM CNN and provided to the\nensemble classifiers (SVM, M.L.P., and AdaboostM1) to improve the hybrid\nlearning generalization. The performance analysis of the proposed DSBEL\nframework and SB-BR-STM CNN against the existing techniques have been evaluated\nby the IOT_Malware dataset on standard performance measures. Evaluation results\nshow progressive performance as 98.50% accuracy, 97.12% F1-Score, 91.91% MCC,\n95.97 % Recall, and 98.42 % Precision. The proposed malware analysis framework\nis helpful for the timely detection of malicious activity and suggests future\nstrategies.",

We\nintroduce Multi-VALUE -- a suite of resources for evaluating and achieving\nEnglish dialect invariance. We build a controllable rule-based translation\nsystem spanning 50 English dialects and a total of 189 unique linguistic\nfeatures. Our translation maps Standard American English text to synthetic form\nof each dialect, which uses an upper-bound on the natural density of features\nin that dialect. First, we use this system to build stress tests for question\nanswering, machine translation, and semantic parsing tasks. Stress tests reveal\nsignificant performance disparities for leading models on non-standard\ndialects. Second, we use this system as a data augmentation technique to\nimprove the dialect robustness of existing systems.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers convert images to sequences by slicing them into patches.\nThe size of these patches controls a speed/accuracy tradeoff, with smaller\npatches leading to higher accuracy at greater computational cost, but changing\nthe patch size typically requires retraining the model. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that simply randomizing the patch size at training time leads to a\nsingle set of weights that performs well across a wide range of patch sizes,\nmaking it possible to tailor the model to different compute budgets at\ndeployment time. We extensively evaluate the resulting model, which we call\nFlexiViT, on a wide range of tasks, including classification, image-text\nretrieval, open-world detection, panoptic segmentation, and semantic\nsegmentation, concluding that it usually matches, and sometimes outperforms,\nstandard ViT models trained at a single patch size in an otherwise identical\nsetup. Hence, FlexiViT training is a simple drop-in improvement for ViT that\nmakes it easy to add compute-adaptive capabilities to most models relying on a\nViT backbone architecture.

    "abstract": "In this work, we give efficient algorithms for privately estimating a\nGaussian distribution in both pure and approximate differential privacy (DP)\nmodels with optimal dependence on the dimension in the sample complexity. In\nthe pure DP setting, we give an efficient algorithm that estimates an unknown\n$d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution up to an arbitrary tiny total variation\nerror using $\\widetilde{O}(d^2 \\log \\kappa)$ samples while tolerating a\nconstant fraction of adversarial outliers. Here, $\\kappa$ is the condition\nnumber of the target covariance matrix. The sample bound matches best\nnon-private estimators in the dependence on the dimension (up to a\npolylogarithmic factor). We prove a new lower bound on differentially private\ncovariance estimation to show that the dependence on the condition number\n$\\kappa$ in the above sample bound is also tight. Prior to our work, only\nidentifiability results (yielding inefficient super-polynomial time algorithms)\nwere known for the problem. In the approximate DP setting, we give an efficient\nalgorithm to estimate an unknown Gaussian distribution up to an arbitrarily\ntiny total variation error using $\\widetilde{O}(d^2)$ samples while tolerating\na constant fraction of adversarial outliers. Prior to our work, all efficient\napproximate DP algorithms incurred a super-quadratic sample cost or were not\noutlier-robust. For the special case of mean estimation, our algorithm achieves\nthe optimal sample complexity of $\\widetilde O(d)$, improving on a $\\widetilde\nO(d^{1.5})$ bound from prior work. Our pure DP algorithm relies on a recursive\nprivate preconditioning subroutine that utilizes the recent work on private\nmean estimation [Hopkins et al., 2022]. Our approximate DP algorithms are based\non a substantial upgrade of the method of stabilizing convex relaxations\nintroduced in [Kothari et al., 2022].",

    "abstract": "Cooperative beamforming design has been recognized as an effective approach\nin modern wireless networks to meet the dramatically increasing demand of\nvarious wireless data traffics. It is formulated as an optimization problem in\nconventional approaches and solved iteratively in an instance-by-instance\nmanner. Recently, learning-based methods have emerged with real-time\nimplementation by approximating the mapping function from the problem instances\nto the corresponding solutions. Among various neural network architectures,\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively utilize the graph topology in\nwireless networks to achieve better generalization ability on unseen problem\nsizes. However, the current GNNs are only equipped with the node-update\nmechanism, which restricts it from modeling more complicated problems such as\nthe cooperative beamforming design, where the beamformers are on the graph\nedges of wireless networks. To fill this gap, we propose an\nedge-graph-neural-network (Edge-GNN) by incorporating an edge-update mechanism\ninto the GNN, which learns the cooperative beamforming on the graph edges.\nSimulation results show that the proposed Edge-GNN achieves higher sum rate\nwith much shorter computation time than state-of-the-art approaches, and\ngeneralizes well to different numbers of base stations and user equipments.",

Cardiovascular\ndisease is a critical illness which causes heart failure, and early and prompt\nidentification can lessen damage and prevent premature mortality. Machine\nlearning has been used to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the\nliterature. The article explains choosing the best classifier model for the\nselected feature sets and the distinct feature sets selected using four feature\nselection models. The paper compares seven classifiers using each of the\nsixteen feature sets. Originally, the data had 56 attributes and 303\noccurrences, of which 87 were in good health, and the remainder had\ncardiovascular disease (CVD). Demographic data with several features make up\nthe four groups of overall features. Lasso, Tree-based algorithms, Chi-Square\nand RFE have all been used to choose the four distinct feature sets, each\ncontaining five, ten, fifteen, and twenty features, respectively. Seven\ndistinct classifiers have been trained and evaluated for each of the sixteen\nfeature sets. To determine the most effective blend of feature set and model, a\ntotal of 112 models have been trained, tested, and their performance has been\ncompared. SVM classifier with fifteen chosen features is shown to be the best\nin terms of overall accuracy. The healthcare data has been maintained in the\ncloud and would be accessible to patients, caretakers, and healthcare providers\nthrough integration with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) enabled smart\nhealthcare. Subsequently, the feature selection model chooses the most\nappropriate feature for CVD prediction to calibrate the system, and the\nproposed framework can be utilised to anticipate CVD.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal image-text models have shown remarkable performance in the past\nfew years. However, evaluating their robustness against distribution shifts is\ncrucial before adopting them in real-world applications. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the robustness of 9 popular open-sourced image-text models under\ncommon perturbations on five tasks (image-text retrieval, visual reasoning,\nvisual entailment, image captioning, and text-to-image generation). In\nparticular, we propose several new multimodal robustness benchmarks by applying\n17 image perturbation and 16 text perturbation techniques on top of existing\ndatasets. We observe that multimodal models are not robust to image and text\nperturbations, especially to image perturbations. Among the tested perturbation\nmethods, character-level perturbations constitute the most severe distribution\nshift for text, and zoom blur is the most severe shift for image data. We also\nintroduce two new robustness metrics (MMI and MOR) for proper evaluations of\nmultimodal models. We hope our extensive study sheds light on new directions\nfor the development of robust multimodal models.",

However, multimodal models\nstill often consist of many task- and modality-specific pieces and training\nprocedures.

We explore an additional unification:\nthe use of a pure pixel-based model to perform image, text, and multimodal\ntasks. Our model is trained with contrastive loss alone, so we call it\nCLIP-Pixels Only (CLIPPO). CLIPPO uses a single encoder that processes both\nregular images and text rendered as images. CLIPPO performs image-based tasks\nsuch as retrieval and zero-shot image classification almost as well as CLIP,\nwith half the number of parameters and no text-specific tower or embedding.\nWhen trained jointly via image-text contrastive learning and next-sentence\ncontrastive learning, CLIPPO can perform well on natural language understanding\ntasks, without any word-level loss (language modelling or masked language\nmodelling), outperforming pixel-based prior work.

    "abstract": "Recent efforts in Neural Rendering Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive\nresults on novel view synthesis by utilizing implicit neural representation to\nrepresent 3D scenes. Due to the process of volumetric rendering, the inference\nspeed for NeRF is extremely slow, limiting the application scenarios of\nutilizing NeRF on resource-constrained hardware, such as mobile devices. Many\nworks have been conducted to reduce the latency of running NeRF models.\nHowever, most of them still require high-end GPU for acceleration or extra\nstorage memory, which is all unavailable on mobile devices. Another emerging\ndirection utilizes the neural light field (NeLF) for speedup, as only one\nforward pass is performed on a ray to predict the pixel color. Nevertheless, to\nreach a similar rendering quality as NeRF, the network in NeLF is designed with\nintensive computation, which is not mobile-friendly. In this work, we propose\nan efficient network that runs in real-time on mobile devices for neural\nrendering. We follow the setting of NeLF to train our network.

To address the MTL challenge, we propose Mod-Squad, a new\nmodel that is Modularized into groups of experts (a 'Squad').

Moreover, we adopt a weight regularization\nmethod to effectively suppress cloudy artifacts and geometry noises which arise\neasily when the density field is transformed during geometry stylization.\nThrough extensive experiments on various styles, we demonstrate that our method\nis effective and robust regarding both single-view stylization quality and\ncross-view consistency.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art brain tumor segmentation is based on deep learning models\napplied to multi-modal MRIs. Currently, these models are trained on images\nafter a preprocessing stage that involves registration, interpolation, brain\nextraction (BE, also known as skull-stripping) and manual correction by an\nexpert. However, for clinical practice, this last step is tedious and\ntime-consuming and, therefore, not always feasible, resulting in\nskull-stripping faults that can negatively impact the tumor segmentation\nquality. Still, the extent of this impact has never been measured for any of\nthe many different BE methods available. In this work, we propose an automatic\nbrain tumor segmentation pipeline and evaluate its performance with multiple BE\nmethods. Our experiments show that the choice of a BE method can compromise up\nto 15.7% of the tumor segmentation performance. Moreover, we propose training\nand testing tumor segmentation models on non-skull-stripped images, effectively\ndiscarding the BE step from the pipeline. Our results show that this approach\nleads to a competitive performance at a fraction of the time. We conclude that,\nin contrast to the current paradigm, training tumor segmentation models on\nnon-skull-stripped images can be the best option when high performance in\nclinical practice is desired.",

Despite some\nrecent advances addressing each of the two problems separately, no results have\nbeen reported that have theoretical guarantees on both privacy protection and\nsaddle/maximum avoidance in decentralized nonconvex optimization. We propose a\nnew algorithm for decentralized nonconvex optimization that can enable both\nrigorous differential privacy and saddle/maximum avoiding performance. The new\nalgorithm allows the incorporation of persistent additive noise to enable\nrigorous differential privacy for data samples, gradients, and intermediate\noptimization variables without losing provable convergence, and thus\ncircumventing the dilemma of trading accuracy for privacy in differential\nprivacy design. More interestingly, the algorithm is theoretically proven to be\nable to efficiently { guarantee accuracy by avoiding} convergence to local\nmaxima and saddle points, which has not been reported before in the literature\non decentralized nonconvex optimization. The algorithm is efficient in both\ncommunication (it only shares one variable in each iteration) and computation\n(it is encryption-free), and hence is promising for large-scale nonconvex\noptimization and learning involving high-dimensional optimization parameters.\nNumerical experiments for both a decentralized estimation problem and an\nIndependent Component Analysis (ICA) problem confirm the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach.",

This paper presents a method to estimate the degree of edema\nfrom facial images taken before and after dialysis of renal failure patients.\nAs tasks to estimate the degree of edema, we perform pre- and post-dialysis\nclassification and body weight prediction. We develop a multi-patient\npre-training framework for acquiring knowledge of edema and transfer the\npre-trained model to a model for each patient. For effective pre-training, we\npropose a novel contrastive representation learning, called weight-aware\nsupervised momentum contrast (WeightSupMoCo). WeightSupMoCo aims to make\nfeature representations of facial images closer in similarity of patient weight\nwhen the pre- and post-dialysis labels are the same. Experimental results show\nthat our pre-training approach improves the accuracy of pre- and post-dialysis\nclassification by 15.1% and reduces the mean absolute error of weight\nprediction by 0.243 kg compared with training from scratch.

Such a method can\nfind applications in surgery, interventional radiology and radiotherapy. By\nestimating a three-dimensional displacement field from a 2D X-ray image,\nanatomical structures segmented in the preoperative scan can be projected onto\nthe 2D image, thus providing a mixed reality view. Methods: A dataset composed\nof displacement fields and 2D projections of the anatomy is generated from the\npreoperative scan. From this dataset, a neural network is trained to recover\nthe unknown 3D displacement field from a single projection image. Results: Our\nmethod is validated on lung 4D CT data at different stages of the lung\ndeformation. The training is performed on a 3D CT using random (non\ndomain-specific) diffeomorphic deformations, to which perturbations mimicking\nthe pose uncertainty are added.

Due\nto this reason, one-shot learning still remains one of the most challenging and\ntrending concepts of deep learning as it proposes to simulate the human-like\nlearning approach in classification problems. Previous studies have focused on\ngenerating more accurate fingerprints of the population using graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) with connectomic brain graph data. Thereby, generated\npopulation fingerprints named connectional brain template (CBTs) enabled\ndetecting discriminative bio-markers of the population on classification tasks.\nHowever, the reverse problem of data augmentation from single graph data\nrepresenting brain connectivity has never been tackled before. In this paper,\nwe propose an augmentation pipeline in order to provide improved metrics on our\nbinary classification problem.

    "abstract": "In molecular research, simulation \\& design of molecules are key areas with\nsignificant implications for drug development, material science, and other\nfields. Current classical computational power falls inadequate to simulate any\nmore than small molecules, let alone protein chains on hundreds of peptide.\nTherefore these experiment are done physically in wet-lab, but it takes a lot\nof time \\& not possible to examine every molecule due to the size of the search\narea, tens of billions of dollars are spent every year in these research\nexperiments. Molecule simulation \\& design has lately advanced significantly by\nmachine learning models, A fresh perspective on the issue of chemical synthesis\nis provided by deep generative models for graph-structured data. By optimising\ndifferentiable models that produce molecular graphs directly, it is feasible to\navoid costly search techniques in the discrete and huge space of chemical\nstructures. But these models also suffer from computational limitations when\ndimensions become huge and consume huge amount of resources. Quantum Generative\nmachine learning in recent years have shown some empirical results promising\nsignificant advantages over classical counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound is progressing toward becoming an affordable and versatile\nsolution to medical imaging. With the advent of COVID-19 global pandemic, there\nis a need to fully automate ultrasound imaging as it requires trained operators\nin close proximity to patients for long period of time. In this work, we\ninvestigate the important yet seldom-studied problem of scan target\nlocalization, under the setting of lung ultrasound imaging. We propose a purely\nvision-based, data driven method that incorporates learning-based computer\nvision techniques. We combine a human pose estimation model with a specially\ndesigned regression model to predict the lung ultrasound scan targets, and\ndeploy multiview stereo vision to enhance the consistency of 3D target\nlocalization. While related works mostly focus on phantom experiments, we\ncollect data from 30 human subjects for testing. Our method attains an accuracy\nlevel of 15.52 (9.47) mm for probe positioning and 4.32 (3.69){\\deg} for probe\norientation, with a success rate above 80% under an error threshold of 25mm for\nall scan targets. Moreover, our approach can serve as a general solution to\nother types of ultrasound modalities. The code for implementation has been\nreleased.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments of advanced driver-assistance systems necessitate an\nincreasing number of tests to validate new technologies. These tests cannot be\ncarried out on track in a reasonable amount of time and automotive groups rely\non simulators to perform most tests. The reliability of these simulators for\nconstantly refined tasks is becoming an issue and, to increase the number of\ntests, the industry is now developing surrogate models, that should mimic the\nbehavior of the simulator while being much faster to run on specific tasks.\nIn this paper we aim to construct a surrogate model to mimic and replace the\nsimulator. We first test several classical methods such as random forests,\nridge regression or convolutional neural networks. Then we build three hybrid\nmodels that use all these methods and combine them to obtain an efficient\nhybrid surrogate model.",

Under a factorization $L = T \\circ W$ for the data-generating\nprocess where $T$ is thought of as a deterministic map acting on some random\ninput $W$, we establish conditions (that might be easily verified using\nknowledge of $T$ alone) that guarantee the continuity of practically\n\\textit{any} derived learning task $x \\mapsto \\mathrm{E}\\left[f \\circ L \\mid X\n= x\\right]$.

However, when applied outside their training domain, NN potential\npredictions can be inaccurate, increasing the need for Uncertainty\nQuantification (UQ). Bayesian modeling provides the mathematical framework for\nUQ, but classical Bayesian methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are\ncomputationally intractable for NN potentials. By training graph NN potentials\nfor coarse-grained systems of liquid water and alanine dipeptide, we\ndemonstrate here that scalable Bayesian UQ via stochastic gradient MCMC\n(SG-MCMC) yields reliable uncertainty estimates for MD observables. We show\nthat cold posteriors can reduce the required training data size and that for\nreliable UQ, multiple Markov chains are needed. Additionally, we find that\nSG-MCMC and the Deep Ensemble method achieve comparable results, despite\nshorter training and less hyperparameter tuning of the latter. We show that\nboth methods can capture aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty reliably, but not\nsystematic uncertainty, which needs to be minimized by adequate modeling to\nobtain accurate credible intervals for MD observables. Our results represent a\nstep towards accurate UQ that is of vital importance for trustworthy NN\npotential-based MD simulations required for decision-making in practice.",

Previously,\nresearchers have looked to Bayesian quantum state tomography due to its unique\nadvantages like natural uncertainty quantification, the return of reliable\nestimates under any measurement condition, and minimal mean-squared error.\nHowever, practical challenges related to long computation times and conceptual\nissues concerning how to incorporate prior knowledge most suitably can\novershadow these benefits. Using both simulated and experimental measurement\nresults, we demonstrate that ML-defined prior distributions reduce net\nconvergence times and provide a natural way to incorporate both implicit and\nexplicit information directly into the prior distribution.
