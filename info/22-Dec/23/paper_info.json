    "abstract": "Large pre-trained models, such as Bert, GPT, and Wav2Vec, have demonstrated\ngreat potential for learning representations that are transferable to a wide\nvariety of downstream tasks . It is difficult to obtain a large quantity of\nsupervised data due to the limited availability of resources and time. In light\nof this, a significant amount of research has been conducted in the area of\nadopting large pre-trained datasets for diverse downstream tasks via fine\ntuning, linear probing, or prompt tuning in low resource settings.\nNormalization techniques are essential for accelerating training and improving\nthe generalization of deep neural networks and have been successfully used in a\nwide variety of applications. A lot of normalization techniques have been\nproposed but the success of normalization in low resource downstream NLP and\nspeech tasks is limited. One of the reasons is the inability to capture\nexpressiveness by rescaling parameters of normalization. We propose\nKullbackLeibler(KL) Regularized normalization (KL-Norm) which make the\nnormalized data well behaved and helps in better generalization as it reduces\nover-fitting, generalises well on out of domain distributions and removes\nirrelevant biases and features with negligible increase in model parameters and\nmemory overheads. Detailed experimental evaluation on multiple low resource NLP\nand speech tasks, demonstrates the superior performance of KL-Norm as compared\nto other popular normalization and regularization techniques.",

    "abstract": "Music discovery services let users identify songs from short mobile\nrecordings. These solutions are often based on Audio Fingerprinting, and rely\nmore specifically on the extraction of spectral peaks in order to be robust to\na number of distortions. Few works have been done to study the robustness of\nthese algorithms to background noise captured in real environments. In\nparticular, AFP systems still struggle when the signal to noise ratio is low,\ni.e when the background noise is strong. In this project, we tackle this\nproblematic with Deep Learning. We test a new hybrid strategy which consists of\ninserting a denoising DL model in front of a peak-based AFP algorithm. We\nsimulate noisy music recordings using a realistic data augmentation pipeline,\nand train a DL model to denoise them. The denoising model limits the impact of\nbackground noise on the AFP system's extracted peaks, improving its robustness\nto noise. We further propose a novel loss function to adapt the DL model to the\nconsidered AFP system, increasing its precision in terms of retrieved spectral\npeaks. To the best of our knowledge, this hybrid strategy has not been tested\nbefore.",

    "abstract": "The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is to mimic the human brain to\nperform decision-making and control directly from high-dimensional sensory\ninput. All-optical diffractive neural networks provide a promising solution for\nrealizing artificial intelligence with high-speed and low-power consumption. To\ndate, most of the reported diffractive neural networks focus on single or\nmultiple tasks that do not involve interaction with the environment, such as\nobject recognition and image classification, while the networks that can\nperform decision-making and control, to our knowledge, have not been developed\nyet. Here, we propose to use deep reinforcement learning to realize diffractive\nneural networks that enable imitating the human-level capability of\ndecision-making and control. Such networks allow for finding optimal control\npolicies through interaction with the environment and can be readily realized\nwith the dielectric metasurfaces. The superior performances of these networks\nare verified by engaging three types of classic games, Tic-Tac-Toe, Super Mario\nBros., and Car Racing, and achieving the same or even higher levels comparable\nto human players. Our work represents a solid step of advancement in\ndiffractive neural networks, which promises a fundamental shift from the\ntarget-driven control of a pre-designed state for simple recognition or\nclassification tasks to the high-level sensory capability of artificial\nintelligence.

From the perspective of 2022, I provide a\ntimeline of the -- in hindsight -- most important relevant events in the\nhistory of NNs, deep learning, AI, computer science, and mathematics in\ngeneral, crediting those who laid foundations of the field.

    "abstract": "Before the transition of AVs to urban roads and subsequently unprecedented\nchanges in traffic conditions, evaluation of transportation policies and\nfuturistic road design related to pedestrian crossing behavior is of vital\nimportance. Recent studies analyzed the non-causal impact of various variables\non pedestrian waiting time in the presence of AVs. However, we mainly\ninvestigate the causal effect of traffic density on pedestrian waiting time. We\ndevelop a Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML) model in which the impact of\nconfounders variable influencing both a policy and an outcome of interest is\naddressed, resulting in unbiased policy evaluation. Furthermore, we try to\nanalyze the effect of traffic density by developing a copula-based joint model\nof two main components of pedestrian crossing behavior, pedestrian stress level\nand waiting time. The copula approach has been widely used in the literature,\nfor addressing self-selection problems, which can be classified as a causality\nanalysis in travel behavior modeling. The results obtained from copula approach\nand DML are compared based on the effect of traffic density. In DML model\nstructure, the standard error term of density parameter is lower than copula\napproach and the confidence interval is considerably more reliable. In\naddition, despite the similar sign of effect, the copula approach estimates the\neffect of traffic density lower than DML, due to the spurious effect of\nconfounders. In short, the DML model structure can flexibly adjust the impact\nof confounders by using machine learning algorithms and is more reliable for\nplanning future policies.",

    "abstract": "In the pulp and paper industry, about 5 Mt/y chemithermomechanical pulp\n(CTMP) are produced globally from softwood chips for production of carton board\ngrades. For tailor making CTMP for this purpose, wood chips are impregnated\nwith aqueous sodium sulphite for sulphonation of the wood lignin. When lignin\nis sulphonated, the defibration of wood into pulp becomes more selective,\nresulting in enhanced pulp properties. On a microscopic fibre scale, however,\none could strongly assume that the sulphonation of the wood structure is very\nuneven due to its macroscale size of wood chips. If this is the case and the\nsulphonation could be done significantly more evenly, the CTMP process could be\nmore efficient and produce pulp even better suited for carton boards.\nTherefore, the present study aimed to develop a technique based on X-ray\nfluorescence microscopy imaging (uXRF) for quantifying the sulphur distribution\non CTMP wood fibres.\nThe feasibility of uXRF imaging for sulphur homogeneity measurements in wood\nfibres needs investigation. Clarification of which spatial and spectral\nresolution that allows visualization of sulphur impregnation into single wood\nfibres is needed. Measurements of single fibre imaging were carried out at the\nAPS synchrotron facility. With a synchrotron beam using 1 um scanning step,\nimages of elemental mapping are acquired from CTMP samples diluted with\nnon-sulphonated pulp under specified conditions. Since the measurements show\nsignificant differ-ences between sulphonated and non-sulphonated fibres, and a\nsignificant peak concentration in the shell of the sulphonated fibres, the\nproposed technique is found to be feasible. The required spatial resolution of\nthe uXRF imaging for an on-site CTMP sulphur homogeneity measurement setup is\nabout 15 um, and the homogeneity measured along the fibre shells is suggested\nto be used as the CTMP sulphonation measurement parameter.",

    "abstract": "We consider the complexity of the open-world query answering problem, where\nwe wish to determine certain answers to conjunctive queries over incomplete\ndatasets specified by an initial set of facts and a set of Guarded TGDs. This\nproblem has been well-studied in the literature and is decidable but with a\nhigh complexity, namely, it is 2EXPTIME complete. Further, the complexity\nshrinks by one exponential when the arity is fixed. We show in this paper how\nwe can obtain better complexity bounds when considering separately the arity of\nthe guard atom and that of the additional atoms, called the side signature. Our\nresults make use of the technique of linearizing Guarded TGDs, introduced in a\npaper of Gottlog, Manna, and Pieris. Specifically, we present a variant of the\nlinearization process, making use of a restricted version of the chase that we\nrecently introduced. Our results imply that open-world query answering can be\nsolved in EXPTIME with arbitrary-arity guard relations if we simply bound the\narity of the side signature; and that the complexity drops to NP if we fix the\nside signature and bound the head arity and width of the dependencies.",

Automated validators can ease the burden of manually checking the\nvalidity of inputs for human testers, although input validity is a concept\ndifficult to formalise and, thus, automate.\nIn this paper, we investigate to what extent TIGs can generate valid inputs,\naccording to both automated and human validators.

Automatically\nmodelling emotional trajectories in stories has thus attracted considerable\nscholarly interest.

We address this gap by introducing continuous valence and arousal\nannotations for an existing dataset of children's stories annotated with\ndiscrete emotion categories. We collect additional annotations for this data\nand map the originally categorical labels to the valence and arousal space.\nLeveraging recent advances in Natural Language Processing, we propose a set of\nnovel Transformer-based methods for predicting valence and arousal signals over\nthe course of written stories. We explore several strategies for fine-tuning a\npretrained ELECTRA model and study the benefits of considering a sentence's\ncontext when inferring its emotionality.

The best configuration achieves a\nConcordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of .7338 for valence and .6302 for\narousal on the test set, demonstrating the suitability of our proposed\napproach.

    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning has been recognized as one of\nthe most promising paradigms for the collaboration of multiple or many clients\nwho cannot disclose their local data -- neither the training data set nor the\nmodel parameters. One popular approach to preserving the confidentiality of\nlocal data is homomorphic encryption (HE): the clients send encrypted model\nparameters to the server, which aggregates the models into a global model and\nbroadcasts it to the clients. Evidently, the security of the above HE-based\napproach depends on the assumption that the clients are honest and cannot\nobtain the encrypted models from others (otherwise the models can be\nimmediately decrypted because all clients share the same private key); this is\nindeed the case since the encrypted models are transmitted through protocols\nlike Transport Layer Security (TLS). However, it is often overlooked that the\nleakage of encrypted models does not necessarily happen on the network channel;\nfor example, if a semi-honest client colludes with a semi-honest server (the\nformer having the private key and the latter having the ciphertext), possibly\noffline in another session, they can surely recover the model parameters in\nquestion. This paper presents a new protocol for secure aggregation under the\nmild, in our opinion more practical, assumption that all parties are\nsemi-honest. As a starting point, we construct a new security primitive, called\n\\textit{asymmetric threshold secret sharing} (ATSS), which works with\nhomomorphic encryption to constitute an aggregation protocol to achieve the\ndesired security. We demonstrate that the ATSS-based protocol is provably\nsecure and delivers reasonable performance in practice.",

The leading order truncation term of the Modified Equation is of\nthe order of the degree of the interpolant which is consistent with numerical\ntests reported in the literature.

Considering a critical situation in the\nstability of tractor-trailer systems, a practical and novel approach is\npresented to design a non-linear MPC(NMPC) local planner for tractor-trailer\nautonomous vehicles in both forward and backward maneuvering. The tractor\nvelocity and steering angle are considered to be control variables. The\nproposed NMPC local planner is designed to handle jackknife situations,\navoiding multiple static obstacles, and path following in both forward and\nbackward maneuvering. The challenges mentioned above are converted into a\nconstrained problem that can be handled simultaneously by the proposed NMPC\nlocal planner. The direct multiple shooting approach is used to convert the\noptimal control problem(OCP) into a non-linear programming problem(NLP) that\nIPOPT solvers can solve in CasADi. The controller performance is evaluated\nthrough different backup and forward maneuvering scenarios in the Gazebo\nsimulation environment in real-time. It achieves asymptotic stability in\navoiding static obstacles and accurate tracking performance while respecting\npath constraints.

    "abstract": "We present a new algorithm for automatically bounding the Taylor remainder\nseries. In the special case of a scalar function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto\n\\mathbb{R}$, our algorithm takes as input a reference point $x_0$, trust region\n$[a, b]$, and integer $k \\ge 0$, and returns an interval $I$ such that $f(x) -\n\\sum_{i=0}^k \\frac {f^{(i)}(x_0)} {i!} (x - x_0)^i \\in I (x - x_0)^{k+1}$ for\nall $x \\in [a, b]$. As in automatic differentiation, the function $f$ is\nprovided to the algorithm in symbolic form, and must be composed of known\nelementary functions.\nAt a high level, our algorithm has two steps. First, for a variety of\ncommonly-used elementary functions (e.g., $\\exp$, $\\log$), we derive sharp\npolynomial upper and lower bounds on the Taylor remainder series. We then\nrecursively combine the bounds for the elementary functions using an interval\narithmetic variant of Taylor-mode automatic differentiation. Our algorithm can\nmake efficient use of machine learning hardware accelerators, and we provide an\nopen source implementation in JAX.\nWe then turn our attention to applications. Most notably, we use our new\nmachinery to create the first universal majorization-minimization optimization\nalgorithms: algorithms that iteratively minimize an arbitrary loss using a\nmajorizer that is derived automatically, rather than by hand. Applied to\nmachine learning, this leads to architecture-specific optimizers for training\ndeep networks that converge from any starting point, without hyperparameter\ntuning. Our experiments show that for some optimization problems, these\nhyperparameter-free optimizers outperform tuned versions of gradient descent,\nAdam, and AdaGrad. We also show that our automatically-derived bounds can be\nused for verified global optimization and numerical integration, and to prove\nsharper versions of Jensen's inequality.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems aim to answer the following question: given the items\nthat a user has interacted with, what items will this user likely interact with\nnext? Historically this problem is often framed as a predictive task via\n(self-)supervised learning. In recent years, we have seen more emphasis placed\non approaching the recommendation problem from a policy optimization\nperspective: learning a policy that maximizes some reward function (e.g., user\nengagement). However, it is commonly the case in recommender systems that we\nare only able to train a new policy given data collected from a\npreviously-deployed policy. The conventional way to address such a policy\nmismatch is through importance sampling correction, which unfortunately comes\nwith its own limitations. In this paper, we suggest an alternative approach,\nwhich involves the use of local policy improvement without off-policy\ncorrection. Drawing from a number of related results in the fields of causal\ninference, bandits, and reinforcement learning, we present a suite of methods\nthat compute and optimize a lower bound of the expected reward of the target\npolicy. Crucially, this lower bound is a function that is easy to estimate from\ndata, and which does not involve density ratios (such as those appearing in\nimportance sampling correction). We argue that this local policy improvement\nparadigm is particularly well suited for recommender systems, given that in\npractice the previously-deployed policy is typically of reasonably high\nquality, and furthermore it tends to be re-trained frequently and gets\ncontinuously updated. We discuss some practical recipes on how to apply some of\nthe proposed techniques in a sequential recommendation setting.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators are being widely used for\ntheir efficiency, but they require a large amount of memory, leading to the use\nof a slow and power consuming external memory. This paper exploits two schemes\nto reduce the required memory amount and ultimately to implement a CNN of\nreasonable performance only with on-chip memory of a practical device like a\nlow-end FPGA. To reduce the memory amount of the intermediate data, a\nstream-based line-buffer architecture and a dataflow for the architecture are\nproposed instead of the conventional frame-based architecture, where the amount\nof the intermediate data memory is proportional to the square of the input\nimage size. The architecture consists of layer-dedicated blocks operating in a\npipelined way with the input and output streams. Each convolutional layer block\nhas a line buffer storing just a few rows of input data. The sizes of the line\nbuffers are proportional to the width of the input image, so the architecture\nrequires less intermediate data storage than the conventional frame-based\narchitecture, especially in the trend of getting larger input size in modern\nobject detection CNNs. In addition to the reduced intermediate data storage,\nthe weight memory is reduced by the accelerator-aware pruning. The experimental\nresults show that a whole object detection CNN can be implemented even on a\nlow-end FPGA without an external memory. Compared to previous accelerators with\nsimilar object detection accuracy, the proposed accelerator reaches much higher\nthroughput even with less FPGA resources of LUTs, registers, and DSPs, showing\nmuch higher efficiency.

Unfortunately, many of them are too subjective to be\nmeasured and presented in online social networks. On the other hand, data\nmining techniques can better find data patterns but many of them leave behind\nunnatural understanding. In this paper, we propose a fundamental methodology to\nsupport the further fusion of data mining techniques and sociological\nbehavioral criteria. Our highlights are three-fold: First, we propose an\neffective hypergraph awareness and a fast line graph construction framework.\nThe hypergraph can more profoundly indicate the interactions between\nindividuals and their environments because each edge in the hypergraph (a.k.a\nhyperedge) contains more than two nodes, which is perfect to describe social\nenvironments. A line graph treats each social environment as a super node with\nthe underlying influence between different environments. In this way, we go\nbeyond traditional pair-wise relations and explore richer patterns under\nvarious sociological criteria; Second, we propose a novel hypergraph-based\nneural network to learn social influence flowing from users to users, users to\nenvironments, environment to users, and environments to environments. The\nneural network can be learned via a task-free method, making our model very\nflexible to support various data mining tasks and sociological analysis; Third,\nwe propose both qualitative and quantitive solutions to effectively evaluate\nthe most common sociological criteria like social conformity, social\nequivalence, environmental evolving and social polarization.

This work considers a double-sided information asymmetry in a Bayesian\nStackelberg game, where the leader's realized action, sampled from the mixed\nstrategy commitment, is hidden from the follower. In contrast, the follower\nholds private information about his payoff. Given asymmetric information on\nboth sides, an important question arises: \\emph{Does the leader's information\nadvantage outweigh the follower's?} We answer this question affirmatively in\nthis work, where we demonstrate that by adequately designing a signaling device\nthat reveals partial information regarding the leader's realized action to the\nfollower, the leader can achieve a higher expected utility than that without\nsignaling. Moreover, unlike previous works on the Bayesian Stackelberg game\nwhere mathematical programming tools are utilized, we interpret the leader's\ncommitment as a probability measure over the belief space. Such a probabilistic\nlanguage greatly simplifies the analysis and allows an indirect signaling\nscheme, leading to a geometric characterization of the equilibrium under the\nproposed game model.",

In response, developers have used increasingly\nexotic solutions to extract more performance from hardware; typically relying\non static, design-time partitioning of their programs which cannot keep pace\nwith storage systems that are layering compute units throughout deepening\nhierarchies of storage devices.\nWe argue that dynamic, just-in-time partitioning of computation offers a\nsolution for emerging data-intensive systems to overcome ever-growing data\nsizes in the face of stalled CPU performance and memory bandwidth. In this\npaper, we describe our prototype computational storage system (CSS), Skytether,\nthat adopts a database perspective to utilize computational storage drives\n(CSDs).

Skytether\nis designed for the extra layer of indirection that CSDs introduce to a storage\nsystem, using decomposable queries to take a new approach to computational\nstorage that has been imagined but not yet explored.\nIn this paper, we evaluate: partition strategies, the overhead of function\nexecution, and the performance of selection and projection.

    "abstract": "The ongoing transformation of mobile networks from proprietary physical\nnetwork boxes to virtualized functions and deployment models has led to more\nscalable and flexible network architectures capable of adapting to specific use\ncases. As an enabler of this movement, the OpenRAN initiative promotes\nstandardization allowing for a vendor-neutral radio access network with open\nAPIs. Moreover, the O-RAN Alliance has begun specification efforts conforming\nto OpenRAN's definitions. This includes the near-real-time RAN Intelligent\nController (RIC) overseeing a group of extensible applications (xApps). The use\nof these potentially untrusted third-party applications introduces a new attack\nsurface to the mobile network plane with fundamental security and system design\nrequirements that are yet to be addressed. To secure the 5G O-RAN xApp model,\nwe introduce the xApp Repository Function (XRF) framework, which implements\nscalable authentication, authorization, and discovery for xApps. We first\npresent the framework's system design and implementation details, followed by\noperational benchmarks in a production-grade containerized environment. The\nevaluation results, centered on active processing and operation times, show\nthat our proposed framework can scale efficiently in a multi-threaded\nKubernetes microservice environment and support a large number of clients with\nminimal overhead.",

    "abstract": "Data trading is essential to accelerate the development of data-driven\nmachine learning pipelines. The central problem in data trading is to estimate\nthe utility of a seller's dataset with respect to a given buyer's machine\nlearning task, also known as data valuation. Typically, data valuation requires\none or more participants to share their raw dataset with others, leading to\npotential risks of intellectual property (IP) violations. In this paper, we\ntackle the novel task of preemptively protecting the IP of datasets that need\nto be shared during data valuation. First, we identify and formalize two kinds\nof novel IP risks in visual datasets: data-item (image) IP and statistical\n(dataset) IP. Then, we propose a novel algorithm to convert the raw dataset\ninto a sanitized version, that provides resistance to IP violations, while at\nthe same time allowing accurate data valuation. The key idea is to limit the\ntransfer of information from the raw dataset to the sanitized dataset, thereby\nprotecting against potential intellectual property violations. Next, we analyze\nour method for the likely existence of a solution and immunity against\nreconstruction attacks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three\ncomputer vision datasets demonstrating the advantages of our method in\ncomparison to other baselines.",

Testing these algorithms in real world create another important\nsafety critical point. Real world testing is also subjected to limitations such\nas logistic limitations to carry or drive the vehicle to a certain location.\nFor this purpose, hardware in the loop (HIL) simulations as well as virtual\nenvironments such as CARLA and LG SVL are used widely. This paper discusses a\nmethod that combines the real vehicle with the virtual world, called vehicle in\nvirtual environment (VVE). This method projects the vehicle location and\nheading into a virtual world for desired testing, and transfers back the\ninformation from sensors in the virtual world to the vehicle. As a result,\nwhile vehicle is moving in the real world, it simultaneously moves in the\nvirtual world and obtains the situational awareness via multiple virtual\nsensors. This would allow testing in a safe environment with the real vehicle\nwhile providing some additional benefits on vehicle dynamics fidelity,\nlogistics limitations and passenger experience testing.

In recent years, deep learning-based methods have achieved\nsuccess. However, existing image dehazing methods typically neglect the\nhierarchy of features in the neural network and fail to exploit their\nrelationships fully. To this end, we propose an effective image dehazing method\nnamed Hierarchical Contrastive Dehazing (HCD), which is based on feature fusion\nand contrastive learning strategies. HCD consists of a hierarchical dehazing\nnetwork (HDN) and a novel hierarchical contrastive loss (HCL). Specifically,\nthe core design in the HDN is a Hierarchical Interaction Module, which utilizes\nmulti-scale activation to revise the feature responses hierarchically. To\ncooperate with the training of HDN, we propose HCL which performs contrastive\nlearning on hierarchically paired exemplars, facilitating haze removal.\nExtensive experiments on public datasets, RESIDE, HazeRD, and DENSE-HAZE,\ndemonstrate that HCD quantitatively outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in\nterms of PSNR, SSIM and achieves better visual quality.",

Our\nimplementation (Acc-t-SNE) is up to 261x and 4x faster than scikit-learn and\nthe state-of-the-art BH t-SNE implementation from daal4py, respectively, on a\n32-core Intel(R) Icelake cloud instance.",

    "abstract": "The external visual inspections of rolling stock's underfloor equipment are\ncurrently being performed via human visual inspection. In this study, we\nattempt to partly automate visual inspection by investigating anomaly\ninspection algorithms that use image processing technology. As the railroad\nmaintenance studies tend to have little anomaly data, unsupervised learning\nmethods are usually preferred for anomaly detection; however, training cost and\naccuracy is still a challenge. Additionally, a researcher created anomalous\nimages from normal images by adding noise, etc., but the anomalous targeted in\nthis study is the rotation of piping cocks that was difficult to create using\nnoise. Therefore, in this study, we propose a new method that uses style\nconversion via generative adversarial networks on three-dimensional computer\ngraphics and imitates anomaly images to apply anomaly detection based on\nsupervised learning. The geometry-consistent style conversion model was used to\nconvert the image, and because of this the color and texture of the image were\nsuccessfully made to imitate the real image while maintaining the anomalous\nshape. Using the generated anomaly images as supervised data, the anomaly\ndetection model can be easily trained without complex adjustments and\nsuccessfully detects anomalies.",

    "abstract": "Curriculum learning and self-paced learning are the training strategies that\ngradually feed the samples from easy to more complex. They have captivated\nincreasing attention due to their excellent performance in robotic vision. Most\nrecent works focus on designing curricula based on difficulty levels in input\nsamples or smoothing the feature maps. However, smoothing labels to control the\nlearning utility in a curriculum manner is still unexplored. In this work, we\ndesign a paced curriculum by label smoothing (P-CBLS) using paced learning with\nuniform label smoothing (ULS) for classification tasks and fuse uniform and\nspatially varying label smoothing (SVLS) for semantic segmentation tasks in a\ncurriculum manner. In ULS and SVLS, a bigger smoothing factor value enforces a\nheavy smoothing penalty in the true label and limits learning less information.\nTherefore, we design the curriculum by label smoothing (CBLS). We set a bigger\nsmoothing value at the beginning of training and gradually decreased it to zero\nto control the model learning utility from lower to higher. We also designed a\nconfidence-aware pacing function and combined it with our CBLS to investigate\nthe benefits of various curricula. The proposed techniques are validated on\nfour robotic surgery datasets of multi-class, multi-label classification,\ncaptioning, and segmentation tasks. We also investigate the robustness of our\nmethod by corrupting validation data into different severity levels. Our\nextensive analysis shows that the proposed method improves prediction accuracy\nand robustness.",

    "abstract": "When simulating soft robots, both their morphology and their controllers play\nimportant roles in task performance. This paper introduces a new method to\nco-evolve these two components in the same process. We do that by using the\nhyperNEAT algorithm to generate two separate neural networks in one pass, one\nresponsible for the design of the robot body structure and the other for the\ncontrol of the robot.\nThe key difference between our method and most existing approaches is that it\ndoes not treat the development of the morphology and the controller as separate\nprocesses. Similar to nature, our method derives both the \"brain\" and the\n\"body\" of an agent from a single genome and develops them together. While our\napproach is more realistic and doesn't require an arbitrary separation of\nprocesses during evolution, it also makes the problem more complex because the\nsearch space for this single genome becomes larger and any mutation to the\ngenome affects \"brain\" and the \"body\" at the same time.\nAdditionally, we present a new speciation function that takes into\nconsideration both the genotypic distance, as is the standard for NEAT, and the\nsimilarity between robot bodies. By using this function, agents with very\ndifferent bodies are more likely to be in different species, this allows robots\nwith different morphologies to have more specialized controllers since they\nwon't crossover with other robots that are too different from them.\nWe evaluate the presented methods on four tasks and observe that even if the\nsearch space was larger, having a single genome makes the evolution process\nconverge faster when compared to having separated genomes for body and control.\nThe agents in our population also show morphologies with a high degree of\nregularity and controllers capable of coordinating the voxels to produce the\nnecessary movements.",

    "abstract": "Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations, each comprising a large number of\nsatellites, have become a new source of big data \"from the sky\". Downloading\nsuch data to a ground station (GS) for big data analytics demands very high\nbandwidth and involves large propagation delays. Federated Learning (FL) offers\na promising solution because it allows data to stay in-situ (never leaving\nsatellites) and it only needs to transmit machine learning model parameters\n(trained on the satellites' data). However, the conventional, synchronous FL\nprocess can take several days to train a single FL model in the context of\nsatellite communication (Satcom), due to a bottleneck caused by straggler\nsatellites. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous FL framework for LEO\nconstellations called AsyncFLEO to improve FL efficiency in Satcom. Not only\ndoes AsynFLEO address the bottleneck (idle waiting) in synchronous FL, but it\nalso solves the issue of model staleness caused by straggler satellites.\nAsyncFLEO utilizes high-altitude platforms (HAPs) positioned \"in the sky\" as\nparameter servers, and consists of three technical components: (1) a\nring-of-stars communication topology, (2) a model propagation algorithm, and\n(3) a model aggregation algorithm with satellite grouping and staleness\ndiscounting. Our extensive evaluation with both IID and non-IID data shows that\nAsyncFLEO outperforms the state of the art by a large margin, cutting down\nconvergence delay by 22 times and increasing accuracy by 40%.",

Hence, an alert system which can\naccurately discover any possible height limiting devices in advance is\nnecessary to be employed in modern large or medium sized cars, such as touring\ncars. Detecting and estimating the height limiting devices act as the key point\nof a successful height limit alert system.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nstereo-based pipeline named SHLE for height limit estimation. Our SHLE pipeline\nconsists of two stages. In stage 1, a novel devices detection and tracking\nscheme is introduced, which accurately locate the height limit devices in the\nleft or right image.

The challenges of crowd\ncounting in highly dense and complex scenes lie in the mutual occlusion of the\nhuman body parts, the large variation of the body scales and the complexity of\nimaging conditions. Deep learning based head detection is a promising method\nfor crowd counting. However the highly concerned object detection networks\ncannot be well applied to this field for two main reasons. First, most of the\nexisting head detection datasets are only annotated with the center points\ninstead of bounding boxes which is mandatory for the canonical detectors.\nSecond, the sample imbalance has not been overcome yet in highly dense and\ncomplex scenes because the existing loss functions calculate the positive loss\nat a single key point or in the entire target area with the same weight. To\naddress these problems, We propose a novel loss function, called Mask Focal\nLoss, to unify the loss functions based on heatmap ground truth (GT) and binary\nfeature map GT. Mask Focal Loss redefines the weight of the loss contributions\naccording to the situ value of the heatmap with a Gaussian kernel.

Theoretically, we focus on\nthe differential flatness property with full exploitation of actual UAV\naerodynamic models, which lays a foundation for generating dynamically feasible\ntrajectory and achieving high-performance tracking control. We have found that\na tail-sitter is differentially flat with accurate aerodynamic models within\nthe entire flight envelope, by specifying coordinate flight condition and\nchoosing the vehicle position as the flat output. This fundamental property\nallows us to fully exploit the high-fidelity aerodynamic models in the\ntrajectory planning and tracking control to achieve accurate tail-sitter\nflights. Particularly, an optimization-based trajectory planner for\ntail-sitters is proposed to design high-quality, smooth trajectories with\nconsideration of kinodynamic constraints, singularity-free constraints and\nactuator saturation. The planned trajectory of flat output is transformed to\nstate trajectory in real-time with consideration of wind in environments. To\ntrack the state trajectory, a global, singularity-free, and\nminimally-parameterized on-manifold MPC is developed, which fully leverages the\naccurate aerodynamic model to achieve high-accuracy trajectory tracking within\nthe whole flight envelope. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is\ndemonstrated through extensive real-world experiments in both indoor and\noutdoor field tests, including agile SE(3) flight through consecutive narrow\nwindows requiring specific attitude and with speed up to 10m/s, typical\ntail-sitter maneuvers (transition, level flight and loiter) with speed up to\n20m/s, and extremely aggressive aerobatic maneuvers (Wingover, Loop, Vertical\nEight and Cuban Eight) with acceleration up to 2.5g.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing the surrounding environment at low latency is critical in\nautonomous driving. In real-time environment, surrounding environment changes\nwhen processing is over. Current detection models are incapable of dealing with\nchanges in the environment that occur after processing. Streaming perception is\nproposed to assess the latency and accuracy of real-time video perception.\nHowever, additional problems arise in real-world applications due to limited\nhardware resources, high temperatures, and other factors. In this study, we\ndevelop a model that can reflect processing delays in real time and produce the\nmost reasonable results. By incorporating the proposed feature queue and\nfeature select module, the system gains the ability to forecast specific time\nsteps without any additional computational costs. Our method is tested on the\nArgoverse-HD dataset. It achieves higher performance than the current\nstate-of-the-art methods(2022.10) in various environments when delayed .

    "abstract": "Multi-die FPGAs are widely adopted to deploy large hardware accelerators. Two\nfactors impede the performance optimization of HLS designs implemented on\nmulti-die FPGAs. On the one hand, the long net delay due to nets crossing\ndie-boundaries results in an NP-hard problem to properly floorplan and pipeline\nan application. On the other hand, traditional automated searching flow for HLS\ndirective optimizations targets single-die FPGAs, and hence, it cannot consider\nthe resource constraints on each die and the timing issue incurred by the\ndie-crossings. Further, it leads to an excessively long runtime to legalize the\nfloorplan of HLS designs generated under each group of configurations during\ndirective optimization due to the large design scale.\nTo co-optimize the directives and floorplan of HLS designs on multi-die\nFPGAs, we propose the FADO framework, which formulates the directive-floorplan\nco-search problem based on the multi-choice multi-dimensional bin-packing and\nsolves it using an iterative optimization flow. For each step of directive\nsearch, a latency-bottleneck-guided greedy algorithm searches for more\nefficient directive configurations. For floorplanning, instead of repetitively\nincurring global floorplanning algorithms, we implement a more efficient\nincremental floorplan legalization algorithm. It mainly applies the worst-fit\nonline bin-packing algorithm to balance the floorplan, together with an offline\nbest-fit-decreasing re-packing to compact the floorplan, followed by pipelining\nof long wires crossing die-boundaries.\nThrough experiments on HLS designs mixing dataflow and non-dataflow kernels,\nFADO not only well-automates the co-optimization and finishes within 693X~4925X\nshorter runtime, compared with DSE assisted by global floorplanning, but also\nyields an improvement of 1.16X~8.78X in overall workflow execution time after\nimplementation on the Xilinx Alveo U250 FPGA.",

    "abstract": "The scalability problem has been one of the most significant barriers\nlimiting the adoption of blockchains. Blockchain sharding is a promising\napproach to this problem. However, the sharding mechanism introduces a\nsignificant number of cross-shard transactions, which are expensive to process.\nThis paper focuses on the transaction allocation problem to reduce the number\nof cross-shard transactions for better scalability. In particular, we\nsystematically formulate the transaction allocation problem and convert it to\nthe community detection problem on a graph. A deterministic and fast allocation\nscheme TxAllo is proposed to dynamically infer the allocation of accounts and\ntheir associated transactions. It directly optimizes the system throughput,\nconsidering both the number of cross-shard transactions and the workload\nbalance among shards.\nWe evaluate the performance of TxAllo on an Ethereum dataset containing over\n91 million transactions. Our evaluation results show that for a blockchain with\n60 shards, TxAllo reduces the cross-shard transaction ratio from 98% (by using\ntraditional hash-based allocation) to about 12%. In the meantime, the workload\nbalance is well maintained. Compared with other methods, the execution time of\nTxAllo is almost negligible. For example, when updating the allocation every\nhour, the execution of TxAllo only takes 0.5 seconds on average, whereas other\nconcurrent works, such as BrokerChain (INFOCOM'22) leveraging the classic METIS\nmethod, require 422 seconds.",

    "abstract": "Traffic jams occurring on highways cause increased travel time as well as\nincreased fuel consumption and collisions. Traffic jams without a clear cause,\nsuch as an on-ramp or an accident, are called phantom traffic jams and are said\nto make up 50% of all traffic jams. They are the result of an unstable traffic\nflow caused by human driving behavior. Automating the longitudinal vehicle\nmotion of only 5% of all cars in the flow can dissipate phantom traffic jams.\nHowever, driving automation introduces safety issues when human drivers need to\ntake over the control from the automation. We investigated whether phantom\ntraffic jams can be dissolved using haptic shared control. This keeps humans in\nthe loop and thus bypasses the problem of humans' limited capacity to take over\ncontrol, while benefiting from most advantages of automation. In an experiment\nwith 24 participants in a driving simulator, we tested the effect of haptic\nshared control on the dynamics of traffic flow, and compared it with manual\ncontrol and full automation. We also investigated the effect of two control\ntypes on participants' behavior during simulated silent automation failures.\nResults show that haptic shared control can help dissipating phantom traffic\njams better than fully manual control but worse than full automation. We also\nfound that haptic shared control reduces the occurrence of unsafe situations\ncaused by silent automation failures compared to full automation. Our results\nsuggest that haptic shared control can dissipate phantom traffic jams while\npreventing safety risks associated with full automation.",

    "abstract": "Finding a small subset of influential nodes to maximise influence spread in a\ncomplex network is an active area of research. Different methods have been\nproposed in the past to identify a set of seed nodes that can help achieve a\nfaster spread of influence in the network. This paper combines driver node\nselection methods from the field of network control, with the\ndivide-and-conquer approach of using community structure to guide the selection\nof candidate seed nodes from the driver nodes of the communities.\nThe use of driver nodes in communities as seed nodes is a comparatively new\nidea. We identify communities of synthetic (i.e., Random, Small-World and\nScale-Free) networks as well as twenty-two real-world social networks. Driver\nnodes from those communities are then ranked according to a range of common\ncentrality measures. We compare the influence spreading power of these seed\nsets to the results of selecting driver nodes at a global level. We show that\nin both synthetic and real networks, exploiting community structure enhances\nthe power of the resulting seed sets.",

    "abstract": "Automatic image colorization is a particularly challenging problem. Due to\nthe high illness of the problem and multi-modal uncertainty, directly training\na deep neural network usually leads to incorrect semantic colors and low color\nrichness. Existing transformer-based methods can deliver better results but\nhighly depend on hand-crafted dataset-level empirical distribution priors. In\nthis work, we propose DDColor, a new end-to-end method with dual decoders, for\nimage colorization. More specifically, we design a multi-scale image decoder\nand a transformer-based color decoder. The former manages to restore the\nspatial resolution of the image, while the latter establishes the correlation\nbetween semantic representations and color queries via cross-attention. The two\ndecoders incorporate to learn semantic-aware color embedding by leveraging the\nmulti-scale visual features. With the help of these two decoders, our method\nsucceeds in producing semantically consistent and visually plausible\ncolorization results without any additional priors. In addition, a simple but\neffective colorfulness loss is introduced to further improve the color richness\nof generated results. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nDDColor achieves significantly superior performance to existing\nstate-of-the-art works both quantitatively and qualitatively.

However, designing and specifying complex optimization\nproblems from more abstract problem descriptions can be a challenging task. A\ndesigner must be an expert in the specific problem domain as well as the ILP\noptimization domain to translate the given problem into a valid ILP problem.\nTypically, domain-specific ILP problem generators are hand-crafted by experts,\nto avoid specifying a new ILP problem by hand for each new instance of a\nproblem domain. Unfortunately, the task of writing ILP problem generators is an\nexercise, which has to be repeated for each new scenario, tool, and approach.\nFor this purpose, we introduce the GIPS (Graph-Based ILP Problem Specification\nTool) framework that simplifies the development of ILP problem generators for\ngraph-based optimization problems and a new Domain-Specific Language (DSL)\ncalled GIPSL (Graph-Based ILP Problem Specification Language) that integrates\nGT and ILP problems on an abstract level.

Our one-shot converse thus takes on an analogous\nrole to the celebrated meta-converse in the complementary problem of channel\ncoding. We asymptotically expand our bounds on the simulation cost for discrete\nmemoryless channels, leading to the second-order as well as the moderate\ndeviation rate expansion. These can be expressed in terms of the channel\ncapacity and channel dispersion known from noisy channel coding. Our bounds\nthen imply the well-known fact that the optimal asymptotic first-order rate of\none channel to simulate another under common randomness-assistance is given by\nthe ratio of their respective capacities. Additionally, our higher-order\nasymptotic expansion shows that this reversibility falls apart in second-order.\nOur techniques extend to discrete memoryless broadcast channels. In stark\ncontrast to the elusive broadcast channel capacity problem, we show that the\nreverse problem of broadcast channel simulation under common\nrandomness-assistance allows for an efficiently computable single-letter\ncharacterization of the asymptotic rate region in terms of the channel's\nmulti-partite mutual information.

    "abstract": "Evaluation is the central means for assessing, understanding, and\ncommunicating about NLP models. In this position paper, we argue evaluation\nshould be more than that: it is a force for driving change, carrying a\nsociological and political character beyond its technical dimensions. As a\nforce, evaluation's power arises from its adoption: under our view, evaluation\nsucceeds when it achieves the desired change in the field. Further, by framing\nevaluation as a force, we consider how it competes with other forces. Under our\nanalysis, we conjecture that the current trajectory of NLP suggests\nevaluation's power is waning, in spite of its potential for realizing more\npluralistic ambitions in the field. We conclude by discussing the legitimacy of\nthis power, who acquires this power and how it distributes.

    "abstract": "Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are regularly used for deep ocean\napplications. Commonly, the autonomous navigation task is carried out by a\nfusion between two sensors: the inertial navigation system and the Doppler\nvelocity log (DVL). The DVL operates by transmitting four acoustic beams to the\nsea floor, and once reflected back, the AUV velocity vector can be estimated.\nHowever, in real-life scenarios, such as an uneven seabed, sea creatures\nblocking the DVL's view and, roll/pitch maneuvers, the acoustic beams'\nreflection is resulting in a scenario known as DVL outage. Consequently, a\nvelocity update is not available to bind the inertial solution drift. To cope\nwith such situations, in this paper, we leverage our BeamsNet framework and\npropose a Set-Transformer-based BeamsNet (ST-BeamsNet) that utilizes inertial\ndata readings and previous DVL velocity measurements to regress the current AUV\nvelocity in case of a complete DVL outage. The proposed approach was evaluated\nusing data from experiments held in the Mediterranean Sea with the Snapir AUV\nand was compared to a moving average (MA) estimator. Our ST-BeamsNet estimated\nthe AUV velocity vector with an 8.547% speed error, which is 26% better than\nthe MA approach.",

    "abstract": "Many studies in educational data mining address specific learner groups, such\nas first-in-family to attend Higher Education, or focus on differences in\ncharacteristics such as gender or ethnicity, with the aim of predicting\nperformance and designing interventions to improve outcomes. For Higher\nEducation, this is reflected in significant interest in institutional-level\nanalysis of student cohorts and in tools being promoted to Higher Education\nInstitutions to support collection, integration and analysis of data. For those\nleading modules/units on degree programmes, however, the reality can be far\nremoved from the seemingly well-supported and increasingly sophisticated\napproaches advocated in centrally-led data analysis. Module leaders often find\nthemselves working with a number of student-data systems that are not\nintegrated, may contain conflicting data and where significant effort is\nrequired to extract, clean and meaningfully analyse the data. This paper\nsuggests that important lessons may be learned from experiences at module level\nin this context and from subsequent analysis of related data collected across\nmultiple years. The changes made each year are described and a range of data\nanalysis methods are applied, post hoc, to identify findings in relation to the\nfour areas of focus. The key findings are that non-engagement with the Virtual\nLearning Environment in the first three weeks was the strongest predictor of\nfailure and that early engagement correlated most strongly with final grade.\nGeneral recommendations are drawn from the findings which should be valuable to\nmodule leaders in environments where access to integrated, up-to-date student\ninformation remains a day-to-day challenge, and insights will be presented into\nhow such bottom-up activities might inform institutional/top-down planning in\nthe use of relevant technologies.",

Existing methods still struggle in challenging poses\nwhere the human body is highly occluded or is closely interacting with the\nscene. To address this issue, we propose a scene-aware egocentric pose\nestimation method that guides the prediction of the egocentric pose with scene\nconstraints. To this end, we propose an egocentric depth estimation network to\npredict the scene depth map from a wide-view egocentric fisheye camera while\nmitigating the occlusion of the human body with a depth-inpainting network.\nNext, we propose a scene-aware pose estimation network that projects the 2D\nimage features and estimated depth map of the scene into a voxel space and\nregresses the 3D pose with a V2V network. The voxel-based feature\nrepresentation provides the direct geometric connection between 2D image\nfeatures and scene geometry, and further facilitates the V2V network to\nconstrain the predicted pose based on the estimated scene geometry. To enable\nthe training of the aforementioned networks, we also generated a synthetic\ndataset, called EgoGTA, and an in-the-wild dataset based on EgoPW, called\nEgoPW-Scene.

Second, iterative clustering iteratively propagates the\npseudo-labels to the ambiguous intervals by clustering, and thus updates the\npseudo-label sequences to train the model.

This paper proposes a reinforcement learning based\napproach to adaptively cache context with the objective of minimizing the cost\nincurred by context management systems in responding to context queries. Our\nnovel algorithms enable context queries and sub-queries to reuse and repurpose\ncached context in an efficient manner. This approach is distinctive to\ntraditional data caching approaches by three main features. First, we make\nselective context cache admissions using no prior knowledge of the context, or\nthe context query load. Secondly, we develop and incorporate innovative\nheuristic models to calculate expected performance of caching an item when\nmaking the decisions. Thirdly, our strategy defines a time-aware continuous\ncache action space. We present two reinforcement learning agents, a value\nfunction estimating actor-critic agent and a policy search agent using deep\ndeterministic policy gradient method. The paper also proposes adaptive policies\nsuch as eviction and cache memory scaling to complement our objective. Our\nmethod is evaluated using a synthetically generated load of context sub-queries\nand a synthetic data set inspired from real world data and query samples. We\nfurther investigate optimal adaptive caching configurations under different\nsettings. This paper presents, compares, and discusses our findings that the\nproposed selective caching methods reach short- and long-term cost- and\nperformance-efficiency. The paper demonstrates that the proposed methods\noutperform other modes of context management such as redirector mode, and\ndatabase mode, and cache all policy by up to 60% in cost efficiency.",

    "title": "GeoCode: Interpretable Shape Programs",
    "abstract": "Mapping high-fidelity 3D geometry to a representation that allows for\nintuitive edits remains an elusive goal in computer vision and graphics. The\nkey challenge is the need to model both continuous and discrete shape\nvariations. Current approaches, such as implicit shape representation, lack\nstraightforward interpretable encoding, while others that employ procedural\nmethods output coarse geometry. We present GeoCode, a technique for 3D shape\nsynthesis using an intuitively editable parameter space. We build a novel\nprogram that enforces a complex set of rules and enables users to perform\nintuitive and controlled high-level edits that procedurally propagate at a low\nlevel to the entire shape. Our program produces high-quality mesh outputs by\nconstruction. We use a neural network to map a given point cloud or sketch to\nour interpretable parameter space. Once produced by our procedural program,\nshapes can be easily modified. Empirically, we show that GeoCode can infer and\nrecover 3D shapes more accurately compared to existing techniques and we\ndemonstrate its ability to perform controlled local and global shape\nmanipulations.",

    "abstract": "We address the task of open-world class-agnostic object detection, i.e.,\ndetecting every object in an image by learning from a limited number of base\nobject classes. State-of-the-art RGB-based models suffer from overfitting the\ntraining classes and often fail at detecting novel-looking objects. This is\nbecause RGB-based models primarily rely on appearance similarity to detect\nnovel objects and are also prone to overfitting short-cut cues such as textures\nand discriminative parts. To address these shortcomings of RGB-based object\ndetectors, we propose incorporating geometric cues such as depth and normals,\npredicted by general-purpose monocular estimators. Specifically, we use the\ngeometric cues to train an object proposal network for pseudo-labeling\nunannotated novel objects in the training set. Our resulting Geometry-guided\nOpen-world Object Detector (GOOD) significantly improves detection recall for\nnovel object categories and already performs well with only a few training\nclasses. Using a single \"person\" class for training on the COCO dataset, GOOD\nsurpasses SOTA methods by 5.0% AR@100, a relative improvement of 24%.",

    "abstract": "Heuristic search algorithms, e.g. A*, are the commonly used tools for\npathfinding on grids, i.e. graphs of regular structure that are widely employed\nto represent environments in robotics, video games etc. Instance-independent\nheuristics for grid graphs, e.g. Manhattan distance, do not take the obstacles\ninto account and, thus, the search led by such heuristics performs poorly in\nthe obstacle-rich environments. To this end, we suggest learning the\ninstance-dependent heuristic proxies that are supposed to notably increase the\nefficiency of the search. The first heuristic proxy we suggest to learn is the\ncorrection factor, i.e. the ratio between the instance independent cost-to-go\nestimate and the perfect one (computed offline at the training phase). Unlike\nlearning the absolute values of the cost-to-go heuristic function, which was\nknown before, when learning the correction factor the knowledge of the\ninstance-independent heuristic is utilized. The second heuristic proxy is the\npath probability, which indicates how likely the grid cell is lying on the\nshortest path. This heuristic can be utilized in the Focal Search framework as\nthe secondary heuristic, allowing us to preserve the guarantees on the bounded\nsub-optimality of the solution. We learn both suggested heuristics in a\nsupervised fashion with the state-of-the-art neural networks containing\nattention blocks (transformers). We conduct a thorough empirical evaluation on\na comprehensive dataset of planning tasks, showing that the suggested\ntechniques i) reduce the computational effort of the A* up to a factor of $4$x\nwhile producing the solutions, which costs exceed the costs of the optimal\nsolutions by less than $0.3$% on average; ii) outperform the competitors, which\ninclude the conventional techniques from the heuristic search, i.e. weighted\nA*, as well as the state-of-the-art learnable planners.",

Our work focused on how\nlaying the foundations of our evaluation methodology into the theory of\nmeasurement can improve our knowledge and understanding of the evaluation\nmeasures we use in IR and how it can shed light on the different types of\nscales adopted by our evaluation measures; we also provided evidence, through\nextensive experimentation, on the impact of the different types of scales on\nthe statistical analyses, as well as on the impact of departing from their\nassumptions. Moreover, we investigated, for the first time in IR, the concept\nof meaningfulness, i.e. the invariance of the experimental statements and\ninferences you draw, and proposed it as a way to ensure more valid and\ngeneralizabile results. Moffat's comments build on: (i) misconceptions about\nthe representational theory of measurement, such as what an interval scale\nactually is and what axioms it has to comply with; (ii) they totally miss the\ncentral concept of meaningfulness. Therefore, we reply to Moffat's comments by\nproperly framing them in the representational theory of measurement and in the\nconcept of meaningfulness. All in all, we can only reiterate what we said\nseveral times: the goal of this research line is to theoretically ground our\nevaluation methodology - and IR is a field where it is extremely challenging to\nperform any theoretical advances - in order to aim for more robust and\ngeneralizable inferences - something we currently lack in the field. Possibly\nthere are other and better ways to achieve this objective and these proposals\ncould emerge from an open discussion in the field and from the work of others.\nOn the other hand, reducing everything to a contrast on what is (or pretend to\nbe) an interval scale or whether all or none evaluation measures are interval\nscales may be more a barrier from than a help in progressing towards this goal.",

    "abstract": "Over the last several decades, improvements in the fields of analytic\ncombinatorics and computer algebra have made determining the asymptotic\nbehaviour of sequences satisfying linear recurrence relations with polynomial\ncoefficients largely a matter of routine, under assumptions that hold often in\npractice. The algorithms involved typically take a sequence, encoded by a\nrecurrence relation and initial terms, and return the leading terms in an\nasymptotic expansion up to a big-O error term. Less studied, however, are\neffective techniques giving an explicit bound on asymptotic error terms. Among\nother things, such explicit bounds typically allow the user to automatically\nprove sequence positivity (an active area of enumerative and algebraic\ncombinatorics) by exhibiting an index when positive leading asymptotic\nbehaviour dominates any error terms. In this article, we present a practical\nalgorithm for computing such asymptotic approximations with rigorous error\nbounds, under the assumption that the generating series of the sequence is a\nsolution of a differential equation with regular (Fuchsian) dominant\nsingularities. Our algorithm approximately follows the singularity analysis\nmethod of Flajolet and Odlyzko, except that all big-O terms involved in the\nderivation of the asymptotic expansion are replaced by explicit error terms.\nThe computation of the error terms combines analytic bounds from the literature\nwith effective techniques from rigorous numerics and computer algebra. We\nimplement our algorithm in the SageMath computer algebra system and exhibit its\nuse on a variety of applications (including our original motivating example,\nsolution uniqueness in the Canham model for the shape of genus one\nbiomembranes).",

However, robustness certification for c-MARLs has not yet\nbeen explored in the community. In this paper, we propose a novel certification\nmethod, which is the first work to leverage a scalable approach for c-MARLs to\ndetermine actions with guaranteed certified bounds. c-MARL certification poses\ntwo key challenges compared with single-agent systems: (i) the accumulated\nuncertainty as the number of agents increases; (ii) the potential lack of\nimpact when changing the action of a single agent into a global team reward.\nThese challenges prevent us from directly using existing algorithms. Hence, we\nemploy the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure considering the\nimportance of each agent to certify per-state robustness and propose a\ntree-search-based algorithm to find a lower bound of the global reward under\nthe minimal certified perturbation. As our method is general, it can also be\napplied in single-agent environments. We empirically show that our\ncertification bounds are much tighter than state-of-the-art RL certification\nsolutions. We also run experiments on two popular c-MARL algorithms: QMIX and\nVDN, in two different environments, with two and four agents.

Euclidean distances between sample vectors are\nused during classification for the methods maximizing the margin in Euclidean\nspaces whereas the Cosine similarity distance is used during the testing stage\nfor the methods maximizing margin in the angular spaces. This paper introduces\na novel classification loss that maximizes the margin in both the Euclidean and\nangular spaces at the same time. This way, the Euclidean and Cosine distances\nwill produce similar and consistent results and complement each other, which\nwill in turn improve the accuracies. The proposed loss function enforces the\nsamples of classes to cluster around the centers that represent them. The\ncenters approximating classes are chosen from the boundary of a hypersphere,\nand the pairwise distances between class centers are always equivalent. This\nrestriction corresponds to choosing centers from the vertices of a regular\nsimplex. There is not any hyperparameter that must be set by the user in the\nproposed loss function, therefore the use of the proposed method is extremely\neasy for classical classification problems. Moreover, since the class samples\nare compactly clustered around their corresponding means, the proposed\nclassifier is also very suitable for open set recognition problems where test\nsamples can come from the unknown classes that are not seen in the training\nphase. Experimental studies show that the proposed method achieves the\nstate-of-the-art accuracies on open set recognition despite its simplicity.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the nonconforming finite elements of order two and order three\nare constructed and exploited for the Stokes problem. The moments of order up\nto $k-1$ ($k=2,3$) on all the facets of the tetrahedron are used for DoFs\n(degrees of freedom) to construct the unisolvent $k$-order nonconforming finite\nelement with the bubble function space of $P_{k+1}$ explicitly represented. The\npair of the $k$-order element and the discontinuous piecewise $P_{k}$ is proved\nto be stable for solving the Stokes problem with the element-wise\ndivergence-free condition preserved. The main difficulty in establishing the\ndiscrete inf-sup condition comes from the fact that the usual Fortin operator\ncan not be constructed. Thanks to the explicit representation of the bubble\nfunctions, its divergence space is proved to be identical to the orthogonal\ncomplement space of constants with respect to $P_k$ on the tetrahedron, which\nplays an important role to overcome the aforementioned difficulty and leads to\nthe desirable well-posedness of the discrete problem. Furthermore, a reduced\n$k$-order nonconforming finite element with a discontinuous piecewise $P_{k-1}$\nis designed and proved to be stable for solving the Stokes problem. The lack of\nthe Fortin operator causes difficulty in analyzing the discrete inf-sup\ncondition for the reduced third-order element pair. To deal with this problem,\nthe so-called macro-element technique is adopted with a crucial algebraic\nresult concerning the property of functions in the orthogonal complement space\nof the divergence of the discrete velocity space with respect to the discrete\npressure space on the macro-element. Numerical experiments are provided to\nvalidate the theoretical results.",

    "abstract": "To extract channel characteristics and conduct channel modeling in\nmillimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) bands, accurate estimations of\nmulti-path component (MPC) parameters in measured results are fundamental.\nHowever, due to high frequency and narrow antenna beams in mmWave and THz\ndirection-scan measurements, existing channel parameter estimation algorithms\nare no longer effective. In this paper, a novel narrow-beam near-field\nspace-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (N2-SAGE) algorithm is\nproposed, which is derived by carefully considering the features of mmWave and\nTHz direction-scan measurement campaigns, such as near field propagation,\nnarrow antenna beams as well as asynchronous measurements in different scanning\ndirections. The delays of MPCs are calculated using spherical wave front (SWF),\nwhich depends on delay and angles of MPCs, resulting in a high-dimensional\nestimation problem. To overcome this, a novel two-phase estimation process is\nproposed, including a rough estimation phase and an accurate estimation phase.\nMoreover, considering the narrow antenna beams used for mmWave and THz\ndirection-scan measurements, the usage of partial information alleviates\ninfluence of background noises. Additionally, the phases of MPCs in different\nscanning directions are treated as random variables, which are estimated and\nreused during the estimation process, making the algorithm immune to possible\nphase errors. Furthermore, performance of the proposed N2-SAGE algorithm is\nvalidated and compared with existing channel parameter estimation algorithms,\nbased on simulations and measured data. Results show that the proposed N2-SAGE\nalgorithm greatly outperforms existing channel parameter estimation algorithms\nin terms of estimation accuracy. By using the N2-SAGE algorithm, the channel is\ncharacterized more correctly and reasonably.",

    "abstract": "Aliasing is a highly important concept in signal processing, as careful\nconsideration of resolution changes is essential in ensuring transmission and\nprocessing quality of audio, image, and video. Despite this, up until recently\naliasing has received very little consideration in Deep Learning, with all\ncommon architectures carelessly sub-sampling without considering aliasing\neffects. In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that the existence of\nadversarial perturbations is due in part to aliasing in neural networks. Our\nultimate goal is to increase robustness against adversarial attacks using\nexplainable, non-trained, structural changes only, derived from aliasing first\nprinciples. Our contributions are the following. First, we establish a\nsufficient condition for no aliasing for general image transformations. Next,\nwe study sources of aliasing in common neural network layers, and derive simple\nmodifications from first principles to eliminate or reduce it. Lastly, our\nexperimental results show a solid link between anti-aliasing and adversarial\nattacks. Simply reducing aliasing already results in more robust classifiers,\nand combining anti-aliasing with robust training out-performs solo robust\ntraining on $L_2$ attacks with none or minimal losses in performance on\n$L_{\\infty}$ attacks.",

While privacy perceptions and preferences are most understood in smart\nhomes, limited studies have evaluated these factors in smart office buildings,\nwhere there are more users and different privacy risks. To better understand\noccupants' perceptions and privacy preferences, we conducted twenty-four\nsemi-structured interviews between April 2022 and May 2022 on occupants of a\nsmart office building.

In contrast, personal features consist of one's awareness of\ndata modality features and data inferences, definitions of privacy and\nsecurity, and the available rewards and utility.

Current techniques either assumed a homogeneous model,\nignoring the microstructure characteristics of composite structures, or\nconsidered a micro-mechanical model, involving intractable computational costs.\nThis paper proposes a peridynamics-based statistical multiscale (PSM) framework\nto simulate the macroscopic structure fracture with high efficiency. The\nheterogeneities of composites, including the shape, spatial distribution and\nvolume fraction of particles, are characterized within the representative\nvolume elements (RVEs), and their impact on structure failure are extracted as\ntwo types of peridynamic parameters, namely, statistical critical stretch and\nequivalent micromodulus.

    "title": "Fixed-budget online adaptive mesh learning for physics-informed neural  networks. Towards parameterized problem inference",
    "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained much attention in\nvarious fields of engineering thanks to their capability of incorporating\nphysical laws into the models. PINNs integrate the physical constraints by\nminimizing the partial differential equations (PDEs) residuals on a set of\ncollocation points. The distribution of these collocation points appears to\nhave a huge impact on the performance of PINNs and the assessment of the\nsampling methods for these points is still an active topic. In this paper, we\npropose a Fixed-Budget Online Adaptive Mesh Learning (FBOAML) method, which\ndecomposes the domain into sub-domains, for training collocation points based\non local maxima and local minima of the PDEs residuals. The stopping criterion\nis based on a data set of reference, which leads to an adaptive number of\niterations for each specific problem. The effectiveness of FBOAML is\ndemonstrated in the context of non-parameterized and parameterized problems.\nThe impact of the hyper-parameters in FBOAML is investigated in this work. The\ncomparison with other adaptive sampling methods is also illustrated. The\nnumerical results demonstrate important gains in terms of accuracy of PINNs\nwith FBOAML over the classical PINNs with non-adaptive collocation points. We\nalso apply FBOAML in a complex industrial application involving coupling\nbetween mechanical and thermal fields. We show that FBOAML is able to identify\nthe high-gradient location and even give better prediction for some physical\nfields than the classical PINNs with collocation points taken on a pre-adapted\nfinite element mesh.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a game-theoretic framework to study the interactions of\nattack and defense for deep learning-based NextG signal classification. NextG\nsystems such as the one envisioned for a massive number of IoT devices can\nemploy deep neural networks (DNNs) for various tasks such as user equipment\nidentification, physical layer authentication, and detection of incumbent users\n(such as in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band). By training\nanother DNN as the surrogate model, an adversary can launch an inference\n(exploratory) attack to learn the behavior of the victim model, predict\nsuccessful operation modes (e.g., channel access), and jam them. A defense\nmechanism can increase the adversary's uncertainty by introducing controlled\nerrors in the victim model's decisions (i.e., poisoning the adversary's\ntraining data). This defense is effective against an attack but reduces the\nperformance when there is no attack. The interactions between the defender and\nthe adversary are formulated as a non-cooperative game, where the defender\nselects the probability of defending or the defense level itself (i.e., the\nratio of falsified decisions) and the adversary selects the probability of\nattacking. The defender's objective is to maximize its reward (e.g., throughput\nor transmission success ratio), whereas the adversary's objective is to\nminimize this reward and its attack cost. The Nash equilibrium strategies are\ndetermined as operation modes such that no player can unilaterally improve its\nutility given the other's strategy is fixed. A fictitious play is formulated\nfor each player to play the game repeatedly in response to the empirical\nfrequency of the opponent's actions. The performance in Nash equilibrium is\ncompared to the fixed attack and defense cases, and the resilience of NextG\nsignal classification against attacks is quantified.",

Quantitative\nalgebraic effects are monadic computational effects on categories of metric\nspaces, which, moreover, admit an algebraic presentation in the form of\nquantitative equational theories, a logical framework introduced by Mardare,\nPanangaden, and Plotkin that generalises equational logic to account for a\nconcept of approximate equality. As our main result, we show that the sum and\ntensor of two quantitative equational theories correspond to the categorical\nsum (i.e., coproduct) and tensor, respectively, of their effects qua monads. We\nfurther give a theory of quantitative effect transformers based on these two\noperations, essentially providing quantitive analogues to the following monad\ntransformers due to Moggi: exception, resumption, reader, and writer\ntransformers. Finally, as an application we provide the first quantitative\nalgebraic axiomatizations to the following coalgebraic structures: Markov\nprocesses, labelled Markov processes, Mealy machines, and Markov decision\nprocesses, each endowed with their respective bisimilarity metrics. Apart from\nthe intrinsic interest in these axiomatizations, it is pleasing they have been\nobtained as the composition, via sum and tensor, of simpler quantitative\nequational theories.",

When distributed learning is run over a set\nof wirelessly connected devices, random channel fluctuations and the incumbent\nservices running on the same network impact the performance of both distributed\nlearning and the coexisting service. In this paper, we investigate a mixed\nservice scenario where distributed AI workflow and ultra-reliable low latency\ncommunication (URLLC) services run concurrently over a network.

For a given target (classification) model, we assume\nthat the attacker knows nothing but the input and output formats and can use\nthe model to derive the prediction for any input in the desired form. Our basic\nidea is to use the target model to affect a GAN training process for a\ncandidate domain's dataset that is easy to obtain.

We then measure the distraction level with the distance\nbetween GAN-generated datasets, which can be used to rank candidate domains for\nthe target model.

In this work we analyze the\nstability properties of these methods and their sensitivity to the low\nprecision rounding errors, and demonstrate their performance in terms of\naccuracy and efficiency. We develop codes in FORTRAN and Julia to solve\nnonlinear systems of ODEs and PDEs using the mixed precision additive\nRunge-Kutta (MP-ARK) methods.

However, they can\nalso allow the exchange of confidential information by journalists. All covert\nchannels described until now therefore need to craft seemingly legitimate\ninformation flows for their information exchange, mimicking unsuspicious\nbehavior.\nIn this paper, we present DYST (Did You See That?), which represents a new\nclass of covert channels we call history covert channels. History covert\nchannels can communicate almost exclusively based on unaltered legitimate\ntraffic created by regular nodes participating in a network. Only a negligible\nfraction of the covert communication process requires the transfer of actual\ncovert channel information. We extend the current taxonomy for covert channels\nto show how history channels can be categorized. We theoretically analyze the\ncharacteristics of history channels and show how their configuration can be\noptimized for two channel implementations, called DYST-Basic and DYST-Ext.\nWe further implement a proof-of-concept code for both DYST variants and\nevaluate the performance (robustness, detectability, and optimization) with\nboth, simulated and real traffic.

To this end,\nRadio Access Network (RAN) resources will need to be carefully \"sliced\" to\nsatisfy heterogeneous application requirements while minimizing RAN usage.\nExisting slicing frameworks treat each DL task as equal and inflexibly define\nthe resources to assign to each task, which leads to sub-optimal performance.\nIn this paper, we propose SEM-O-RAN, the first semantic and flexible slicing\nframework for NextG Open RANs. Our key intuition is that different DL\nclassifiers can tolerate different levels of image compression, due to the\nsemantic nature of the target classes. Therefore, compression can be\nsemantically applied so that the networking load can be minimized. Moreover,\nflexibility allows SEM-O-RAN to consider multiple edge allocations leading to\nthe same task-related performance, which significantly improves system-wide\nperformance as more tasks can be allocated. First, we mathematically formulate\nthe Semantic Flexible Edge Slicing Problem (SF-ESP), demonstrate that it is\nNP-hard, and provide an approximation algorithm to solve it efficiently. Then,\nwe evaluate the performance of SEM-O-RAN through extensive numerical analysis\nwith state-of-the-art multi-object detection (YOLOX) and image segmentation\n(BiSeNet V2), as well as real-world experiments on the Colosseum testbed.

These\ninterventions also differ in how effective they are at reducing susceptibility\nto (and curbing the spread of) misinformation. In recent years, a vast amount\nof scholarly work on misinformation has become available, which extends across\nmultiple disciplines and methodologies. It has become increasingly difficult to\ncomprehensively map all of the available interventions, assess their efficacy,\nand understand the challenges, opportunities and tradeoffs associated with\nusing them. Few papers have systematically assessed and compared the various\ninterventions, which has led to a lack of understanding in civic and\npolicymaking discourses. With this in mind, we develop a new hierarchical\nframework for understanding interventions against misinformation online. The\nframework comprises three key elements: Interventions that Prepare people to be\nless susceptible; Interventions that Curb the spread and effects of\nmisinformation; and Interventions that Respond to misinformation. We outline\nhow different interventions are thought to work, categorise them, and summarise\nthe available evidence on their efficacy; offering researchers, policymakers\nand practitioners working to combat online misinformation both an analytical\nframework that they can use to understand and evaluate different interventions\n(and which could be extended to address new interventions that we do not\ndescribe here) and a summary of the range of interventions that have been\nproposed to date.",

However, original KGs employed in\nexisting CRSs are often incomplete and sparse, which limits the reasoning\ncapability in recommendation. Moreover, only few of existing studies exploit\nthe dialogue context to dynamically refine knowledge from KGs for better\nrecommendation. To address the above issues, we propose the Variational\nReasoning over Incomplete KGs Conversational Recommender (VRICR). Our key idea\nis to incorporate the large dialogue corpus naturally accompanied with CRSs to\nenhance the incomplete KGs; and perform dynamic knowledge reasoning conditioned\non the dialogue context. Specifically, we denote the dialogue-specific\nsubgraphs of KGs as latent variables with categorical priors for adaptive\nknowledge graphs refactor. We propose a variational Bayesian method to\napproximate posterior distributions over dialogue-specific subgraphs, which not\nonly leverages the dialogue corpus for restructuring missing entity relations\nbut also dynamically selects knowledge based on the dialogue context.

In addition to the advantages in terms of efficiency and cost\nreduction, this evolution will increase the network reliability, also allowing\nfor a fine trade-off between robustness and maximum capacity exploitation. In\nthis work, an optical network architecture is presented based on the physical\nlayer digital twin of the optical transport used within a multi-layer\nhierarchical control operated by an intent-based network operating system.

Thus, understanding the factors that cause patients to\nleave before treatment is complete is vital to mitigate and potentially\neliminate these adverse effects. This paper proposes a framework for studying\nthe factors that affect LBTC outcomes in EDs. The framework integrates machine\nlearning, metaheuristic optimization, and model interpretation techniques.\nMetaheuristic optimization is used for hyperparameter optimization--one of the\nmain challenges of machine learning model development. Three metaheuristic\noptimization algorithms are employed for optimizing the parameters of extreme\ngradient boosting (XGB), which are simulated annealing (SA), adaptive simulated\nannealing (ASA), and adaptive tabu simulated annealing (ATSA). The optimized\nXGB models are used to predict the LBTC outcomes for the patients under\ntreatment in ED. The designed algorithms are trained and tested using four data\ngroups resulting from the feature selection phase. The model with the best\npredictive performance is interpreted using SHaply Additive exPlanations (SHAP)\nmethod. The findings show that ATSA-XGB outperformed other mode configurations\nwith an accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and\nF1-score of 86.61%, 87.50%, 85.71%, 87.51%, and 86.60%, respectively.

Some key parameters involved in PDEs, which\nrepresents certain physical properties with important scientific\ninterpretations, are difficult or even impossible to be measured directly.\nEstimation of these parameters from noisy and sparse experimental data of\nrelated physical quantities is an important task. Many methods for PDE\nparameter inference involve a large number of evaluations of numerical solution\nof PDE through algorithms such as finite element method, which can be\ntime-consuming especially for nonlinear PDEs. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod for estimating unknown parameters in PDEs, called PDE-Informed Gaussian\nProcess Inference (PIGPI). Through modeling the PDE solution as a Gaussian\nprocess (GP), we derive the manifold constraints induced by the (linear) PDE\nstructure such that under the constraints, the GP satisfies the PDE. For\nnonlinear PDEs, we propose an augmentation method that transfers the nonlinear\nPDE into an equivalent PDE system linear in all derivatives that our PIGPI can\nhandle. PIGPI can be applied to multi-dimensional PDE systems and PDE systems\nwith unobserved components. The method completely bypasses the numerical solver\nfor PDE, thus achieving drastic savings in computation time, especially for\nnonlinear PDEs.

Different tools are\nused for patient triage and one of the most common ones is the emergency\nseverity index (ESI), which has a scale of five levels, where level 1 is the\nmost urgent and level 5 is the least urgent. This paper proposes a framework\nfor utilizing machine learning to develop an e-triage tool that can be used at\nEDs. A large retrospective dataset of ED patient visits is obtained from the\nelectronic health record of a healthcare provider in the Midwest of the US for\nthree years. However, the main challenge of using machine learning algorithms\nis that most of them have many parameters and without optimizing these\nparameters, developing a high-performance model is not possible. This paper\nproposes an approach to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning. The\nmetaheuristic optimization algorithms simulated annealing (SA) and adaptive\nsimulated annealing (ASA) are proposed to optimize the parameters of extreme\ngradient boosting (XGB) and categorical boosting (CaB). The newly proposed\nalgorithms are SA-XGB, ASA-XGB, SA-CaB, ASA-CaB. Grid search (GS), which is a\ntraditional approach used for machine learning fine-tunning is also used to\nfine-tune the parameters of XGB and CaB, which are named GS-XGB and GS-CaB.

    "abstract": "Probabilistic Law Discovery (PLD) is a logic based Machine Learning method,\nwhich implements a variant of probabilistic rule learning. In several aspects,\nPLD is close to Decision Tree/Random Forest methods, but it differs\nsignificantly in how relevant rules are defined. The learning procedure of PLD\nsolves the optimization problem related to the search for rules (called\nprobabilistic laws), which have a minimal length and relatively high\nprobability. At inference, ensembles of these rules are used for prediction.\nProbabilistic laws are human-readable and PLD based models are transparent and\ninherently interpretable. Applications of PLD include\nclassification/clusterization/regression tasks, as well as time series\nanalysis/anomaly detection and adaptive (robotic) control. In this paper, we\noutline the main principles of PLD, highlight its benefits and limitations and\nprovide some application guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are weaving their way\ninto the fabric of society, where they are playing a crucial role in numerous\nfacets of our lives. As we witness the increased deployment of AI and ML in\nvarious types of devices, we benefit from their use into energy-efficient\nalgorithms for low powered devices. In this paper, we investigate a scale and\nmedium that is far smaller than conventional devices as we move towards\nmolecular systems that can be utilized to perform machine learning functions,\ni.e., Molecular Machine Learning (MML). Fundamental to the operation of MML is\nthe transport, processing, and interpretation of information propagated by\nmolecules through chemical reactions. We begin by reviewing the current\napproaches that have been developed for MML, before we move towards potential\nnew directions that rely on gene regulatory networks inside biological\norganisms as well as their population interactions to create neural networks.\nWe then investigate mechanisms for training machine learning structures in\nbiological cells based on calcium signaling and demonstrate their application\nto build an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC).

While the task has\nreceived much attention in the last decades, researchers have almost\nexclusively focused on the single object setting.

Our benchmark allows researchers to tackle key remaining\nchallenges in GOT, aiming to increase robustness and reduce computation through\njoint tracking of multiple objects simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose a\nTransformer-based GOT tracker TaMOS capable of joint processing of multiple\nobjects through shared computation. TaMOs achieves a 4x faster run-time in case\nof 10 concurrent objects compared to tracking each object independently and\noutperforms existing single object trackers on our new benchmark.

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a high order DGSEM formulation for balance laws\nwhich embeds a general well balanced criterion agnostic of the exact steady\nstate. The construction proposed exploits the idea of a global flux formulation\nto infer an ad-hoc quadrature strategy called here \"global flux quadrature\".\nThis quadrature approach allows to establish a one to one correspondence, for a\ngiven local set of data on a given stencil, between the discretization of a\nnon-local integral operator, and the local steady differential problem. This\nequivalence is a discrete well balanced notion which allows to construct\nbalanced schemes without explicit knowledge of the steady state, and in\nparticular without the need of solving a local Cauchy problem. The use of\nGauss-Lobatto DGSEM allows a natural connection to continuous collocation\nmethods for integral equations. This allows to fully characterize the discrete\nsteady solution with a superconvergence result. The notion of entropy control\nis also included in the construction via appropriately designed cell artificial\nviscosity corrections. The accuracy and equilibrium preservation of these\ncorrections are characterized theoretically and numerically. In particular,\nthorough numerical benchmarking, we confirm all the theoretical expectations\nshowing improvements in accuracy on steady states of one or two orders of\nmagnitude, with a simple modification of a given DGSEM implementation.\nRobustness on more complex cases is also proved. Preliminary tests on\nmultidimensional problems shows improvements on the preservation of vortex like\nsolutions with important error reductions, despite of the fact that no genuine\n2D balancing criterion is embedded.",

    "abstract": "The strength of social relations has been shown to affect an individual's\naccess to opportunities. To date, however, the correspondence between tie\nstrength and population's economic prospects has not been quantified, largely\nbecause of the inability to operationalise strength based on Granovetter's\nclassic theory. Our work departed from the premise that tie strength is a\nunidimensional construct (typically operationalized with frequency or volume of\ncontact), and used instead a validated model of ten fundamental dimensions of\nsocial relationships grounded in the literature of social psychology. We built\nstate-of-the-art NLP tools to infer the presence of these dimensions from\ntextual communication, and analyzed a large conversation network of 630K\ngeo-referenced Reddit users across the entire US connected by 12.8M social ties\ncreated over the span of 7 years. We found that unidimensional tie strength is\nonly weakly correlated with economic opportunities (R2=0.30), while\nmultidimensional constructs are highly correlated (R2=0.62). In particular,\neconomic opportunities are associated to the combination of: i) knowledge ties,\nwhich bridge geographically distant groups, facilitating the knowledge\ndissemination across communities; and ii) social support ties, which knit\ngeographically close communities together, and represent dependable sources of\nsocial and emotional support. These results point to the importance of\ndeveloping high-quality measures of tie strength in network theory.",

Knee OA is not a\ncurable disease yet, and it affects large columns of patients, making it costly\nto patients and healthcare systems. Etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of knee\nOA might be argued by variability in its clinical and physical manifestations.\nAlthough knee OA carries a list of well-known terminology aiming to standardize\nthe nomenclature of the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and clinical outcomes\nof the chronic joint disease, in practice there is a wide range of terminology\nassociated with knee OA across different data sources, including but not\nlimited to biomedical literature, clinical notes, healthcare literacy, and\nhealth-related social media.

    "abstract": "Streaming graph processing involves performing updates and analytics on a\ntime-evolving graph. The underlying representation format largely determines\nthe throughputs of these updates and analytics phases. Existing formats usually\nemploy variations of hash tables or adjacency lists. However,\nadjacency-list-based approaches perform poorly on heavy-tailed graphs, and the\nhash-based approaches suffer on short-tailed graphs. We propose GraphTango, a\nhybrid format that provides excellent update and analytics throughput\nregardless of the graph's degree distribution. GraphTango switches among three\ndifferent formats based on a vertex's degree: i) Low-degree vertices store the\nedges directly with the neighborhood metadata, confining accesses to a single\ncache line, ii) Medium-degree vertices use adjacency lists, and iii)\nHigh-degree vertices use hash tables as well as adjacency lists. In this case,\nadjacency list provides fast traversal during the analytics phase, while the\nhash table provides constant-time lookups during the update phase. We further\noptimized the performance by designing an open-addressing-based hash table that\nfully utilizes every fetched cache line. In addition, we developed a\nthread-local lock-free memory pool that allows fast growing/shrinking of the\nadjacency lists and hash tables in a multi-threaded environment. We evaluated\nGraphTango with the help of the SAGA-Bench framework and compared it with four\nother representation formats. On average, GraphTango provides 4.5x higher\ninsertion throughput, 3.2x higher deletion throughput, and 1.1x higher\nanalytics throughput over the next best format. Furthermore, we integrated\nGraphTango with the state-of-the-art graph processing frameworks DZiG and\nRisGraph.

In response, we explore three new\nextensions to Cobweb -- the Word, Leaf, and Path variants.

As in the original Cobweb, a performance element sorts a\nnew instance downward through the hierarchy and uses the final node to predict\nmissing features. Learning is interleaved with performance, updating concept\nprobabilities and hierarchy structure as classification occurs. Thus, the new\napproaches process training cases in an incremental, online manner that it very\ndifferent from most methods for statistical language learning. We examine how\nwell the three variants place synonyms together and keep homonyms apart, their\nability to recall synonyms as a function of training set size, and their\ntraining efficiency.

This paper initiated a large body of work in network design,\nin which problems are attacked by reduction to $\\gamma$ or the analogous\nextremal function for other girth concepts. In this paper, we introduce and\nstudy a new girth concept that we call the bridge girth of path systems, and we\nshow that it can be used to significantly expand and improve this web of\nconnections between girth problems and network design. We prove two kinds of\nresults:\n1) We write the maximum possible size of an $n$-node, $p$-path system with\nbridge girth $>k$ as $\\beta(n, p, k)$, and we write a certain variant for\n\"ordered\" path systems as $\\beta^*(n, p, k)$. We identify several arguments in\nthe literature that implicitly show upper or lower bounds on $\\beta, \\beta^*$,\nand we provide some polynomially improvements to these bounds. In particular,\nwe construct a tight lower bound for $\\beta(n, p, 2)$, and we polynomially\nimprove the upper bounds for $\\beta(n, p, 4)$ and $\\beta^*(n, p, \\infty)$.\n2) We show that many state-of-the-art results in network design can be\nrecovered or improved via black-box reductions to $\\beta$ or $\\beta^*$.\nExamples include bounds for distance/reachability preservers, exact hopsets,\nshortcut sets, the flow-cut gaps for directed multicut and sparsest cut, an\nintegrality gap for directed Steiner forest.\nWe believe that the concept of bridge girth can lead to a stronger and more\norganized map of the research area.

In this paper, we present a transformer-based\nmodel to extract multi-scale representations, and perform Asymmetric\nCross-Scale Alignment (ACSA) to precisely align the two modalities.\nSpecifically, ACSA consists of a global-level alignment module and an\nasymmetric cross-attention module, where the former aligns an image and texts\non a global scale, and the latter applies the cross-attention mechanism to\ndynamically align the cross-modal entities in region/image-phrase scales.\nExtensive experiments on two benchmark datasets CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

    "title": "Removing Objects From Neural Radiance Fields",
    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are emerging as a ubiquitous scene\nrepresentation that allows for novel view synthesis. Increasingly, NeRFs will\nbe shareable with other people. Before sharing a NeRF, though, it might be\ndesirable to remove personal information or unsightly objects. Such removal is\nnot easily achieved with the current NeRF editing frameworks. We propose a\nframework to remove objects from a NeRF representation created from an RGB-D\nsequence. Our NeRF inpainting method leverages recent work in 2D image\ninpainting and is guided by a user-provided mask. Our algorithm is underpinned\nby a confidence based view selection procedure. It chooses which of the\nindividual 2D inpainted images to use in the creation of the NeRF, so that the\nresulting inpainted NeRF is 3D consistent. We show that our method for NeRF\nediting is effective for synthesizing plausible inpaintings in a multi-view\ncoherent manner. We validate our approach using a new and still-challenging\ndataset for the task of NeRF inpainting.",

In the\nmeantime, e-scooters are also posing new challenges to traffic safety. In\ngeneral, e-scooters are suggested to be ridden in bike lanes/sidewalks or share\nthe road with cars at the maximum speed of about 15-20 mph, which is more\nflexible and much faster than the pedestrains and bicyclists. These features\nmake e-scooters challenging for human drivers, pedestrians, vehicle active\nsafety modules, and self-driving modules to see and interact.

    "abstract": "Existing 3D-aware image synthesis approaches mainly focus on generating a\nsingle canonical object and show limited capacity in composing a complex scene\ncontaining a variety of objects. This work presents DisCoScene: a 3Daware\ngenerative model for high-quality and controllable scene synthesis. The key\ningredient of our method is a very abstract object-level representation (i.e.,\n3D bounding boxes without semantic annotation) as the scene layout prior, which\nis simple to obtain, general to describe various scene contents, and yet\ninformative to disentangle objects and background. Moreover, it serves as an\nintuitive user control for scene editing. Based on such a prior, the proposed\nmodel spatially disentangles the whole scene into object-centric generative\nradiance fields by learning on only 2D images with the global-local\ndiscrimination. Our model obtains the generation fidelity and editing\nflexibility of individual objects while being able to efficiently compose\nobjects and the background into a complete scene.

    "abstract": "Quantum many-body problems are some of the most challenging problems in\nscience and are central to demystifying some exotic quantum phenomena, e.g.,\nhigh-temperature superconductors. The combination of neural networks (NN) for\nrepresenting quantum states, coupled with the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC)\nalgorithm, has been shown to be a promising method for solving such problems.\nHowever, the run-time of this approach scales quadratically with the number of\nsimulated particles, constraining the practically usable NN to - in machine\nlearning terms - minuscule sizes (<10M parameters). Considering the many\nbreakthroughs brought by extreme NN in the +1B parameters scale to other\ndomains, lifting this constraint could significantly expand the set of quantum\nsystems we can accurately simulate on classical computers, both in size and\ncomplexity. We propose a NN architecture called Vector-Quantized Neural Quantum\nStates (VQ-NQS) that utilizes vector-quantization techniques to leverage\nredundancies in the local-energy calculations of the VMC algorithm - the source\nof the quadratic scaling. In our preliminary experiments, we demonstrate VQ-NQS\nability to reproduce the ground state of the 2D Heisenberg model across various\nsystem sizes, while reporting a significant reduction of about ${\\times}10$ in\nthe number of FLOPs in the local-energy calculation.",

During TURBT interventions, White\nLight Imaging (WLI) and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) techniques are used for\nlesion detection. Each imaging technique provides diverse visual information\nthat allows clinicians to identify and classify cancerous lesions. Computer\nvision methods that use both imaging techniques could improve endoscopic\ndiagnosis. We address the challenge of tissue classification when annotations\nare available only in one domain, in our case WLI, and the endoscopic images\ncorrespond to an unpaired dataset, i.e. there is no exact equivalent for every\nimage in both NBI and WLI domains. Method: We propose a semi-surprised\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based method composed of three main\ncomponents: a teacher network trained on the labeled WLI data; a\ncycle-consistency GAN to perform unpaired image-to-image translation, and a\nmulti-input student network. To ensure the quality of the synthetic images\ngenerated by the proposed GAN we perform a detailed quantitative, and\nqualitative analysis with the help of specialists. Conclusion: The overall\naverage classification accuracy, precision, and recall obtained with the\nproposed method for tissue classification are 0.90, 0.88, and 0.89\nrespectively, while the same metrics obtained in the unlabeled domain (NBI) are\n0.92, 0.64, and 0.94 respectively. The quality of the generated images is\nreliable enough to deceive specialists.

This paper proposes to unify\nthese subjects and study Generalized Speech Enhancement, where the goal is not\nto reconstruct the exact reference clean signal, but to focus on improving\ncertain aspects of speech. In particular, this paper concerns intelligibility,\nquality, and video synchronization. We cast the problem as audio-visual speech\nresynthesis, which is composed of two steps: pseudo audio-visual speech\nrecognition (P-AVSR) and pseudo text-to-speech synthesis (P-TTS). P-AVSR and\nP-TTS are connected by discrete units derived from a self-supervised speech\nmodel. Moreover, we utilize self-supervised audio-visual speech model to\ninitialize P-AVSR.

ReVISE is the first\nhigh-quality model for in-the-wild video-to-speech synthesis and achieves\nsuperior performance on all LRS3 audio-visual enhancement tasks with a single\nmodel. To demonstrates its applicability in the real world, ReVISE is also\nevaluated on EasyCom, an audio-visual benchmark collected under challenging\nacoustic conditions with only 1.6 hours of training data.

Moreover, while existing bandit algorithms mainly focused on\nreward-maximization, less attention has been paid to the statistical inference.\nTo fill in these gaps, in this work we consider a matrix contextual bandit\nframework where the true model parameter is a low-rank matrix, and propose a\nfully online procedure to simultaneously make sequential decision-making and\nconduct statistical inference. The low-rank structure of the model parameter\nand the adaptivity nature of the data collection process makes this difficult:\nstandard low-rank estimators are not fully online and are biased, while\nexisting inference approaches in bandit algorithms fail to account for the\nlow-rankness and are also biased. To address these, we introduce a new online\ndoubly-debiasing inference procedure to simultaneously handle both sources of\nbias. In theory, we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed online\ndoubly-debiased estimator and prove the validity of the constructed confidence\ninterval. Our inference results are built upon a newly developed low-rank\nstochastic gradient descent estimator and its non-asymptotic convergence\nresult, which is also of independent interest.",

Nevertheless, a theoretical understanding of its success is still\nincomplete. One mystery is the paradox between memorization and generalization:\nIn theory, the model is trained to be exactly the same as the empirical\ndistribution of the finite samples, whereas in practice, the trained model can\ngenerate new samples or estimate the likelihood of unseen samples. Likewise,\nthe overwhelming diversity of distribution learning models calls for a unified\nperspective on this subject. This paper provides a mathematical framework such\nthat all the well-known models can be derived based on simple principles. To\ndemonstrate its efficacy, we present a survey of our results on the\napproximation error, training error and generalization error of these models,\nwhich can all be established based on this framework. In particular, the\naforementioned paradox is resolved by proving that these models enjoy implicit\nregularization during training, so that the generalization error at\nearly-stopping avoids the curse of dimensionality.

Consequently, the goal is to provide a valid synthesis\nroute for a molecule. As more single-step models develop, we see increasing\naccuracy in the prediction of molecular disconnections, potentially improving\nthe creation of synthetic paths. Multi-step approaches repeatedly apply the\nchemical information stored in single-step retrosynthesis models. However, this\nconnection is not reflected in contemporary research, fixing either the\nsingle-step model or the multi-step algorithm in the process. In this work, we\nestablish a bridge between both tasks by benchmarking the performance and\ntransfer of different single-step retrosynthesis models to the multi-step\ndomain by leveraging two common search algorithms, Monte Carlo Tree Search and\nRetro*. We show that models designed for single-step retrosynthesis, when\nextended to multi-step, can have a tremendous impact on the route finding\ncapabilities of current multi-step methods, improving performance by up to +30%\ncompared to the most widely used model. Furthermore, we observe no clear link\nbetween contemporary single-step and multi-step evaluation metrics, showing\nthat single-step models need to be developed and tested for the multi-step\ndomain and not as an isolated task to find synthesis routes for molecules of\ninterest.",

    "title": "The Quantum Path Kernel: a Generalized Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel for  Deep Quantum Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "Building a quantum analog of classical deep neural networks represents a\nfundamental challenge in quantum computing. A key issue is how to address the\ninherent non-linearity of classical deep learning, a problem in the quantum\ndomain due to the fact that the composition of an arbitrary number of quantum\ngates, consisting of a series of sequential unitary transformations, is\nintrinsically linear. This problem has been variously approached in the\nliterature, principally via the introduction of measurements between layers of\nunitary transformations. In this paper, we introduce the Quantum Path Kernel, a\nformulation of quantum machine learning capable of replicating those aspects of\ndeep machine learning typically associated with superior generalization\nperformance in the classical domain, specifically, hierarchical feature\nlearning. Our approach generalizes the notion of Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel,\nwhich has been used to study the dynamics of classical and quantum machine\nlearning models. The Quantum Path Kernel exploits the parameter trajectory,\ni.e. the curve delineated by model parameters as they evolve during training,\nenabling the representation of differential layer-wise convergence behaviors,\nor the formation of hierarchical parametric dependencies, in terms of their\nmanifestation in the gradient space of the predictor function. We evaluate our\napproach with respect to variants of the classification of Gaussian XOR\nmixtures - an artificial but emblematic problem that intrinsically requires\nmultilevel learning in order to achieve optimal class separation.",

    "abstract": "Deep image prior (DIP) has recently attracted attention owing to its\nunsupervised positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction, which\ndoes not require any prior training dataset. In this paper, we present the\nfirst attempt to implement an end-to-end DIP-based fully 3D PET image\nreconstruction method that incorporates a forward-projection model into a loss\nfunction. To implement a practical fully 3D PET image reconstruction, which\ncould not be performed due to a graphics processing unit memory limitation, we\nmodify the DIP optimization to block-iteration and sequentially learn an\nordered sequence of block sinograms. Furthermore, the relative difference\npenalty (RDP) term was added to the loss function to enhance the quantitative\nPET image accuracy. We evaluated our proposed method using Monte Carlo\nsimulation with [$^{18}$F]FDG PET data of a human brain and a preclinical study\non monkey brain [$^{18}$F]FDG PET data. The proposed method was compared with\nthe maximum-likelihood expectation maximization (EM), maximum-a-posterior EM\nwith RDP, and hybrid DIP-based PET reconstruction methods. The simulation\nresults showed that the proposed method improved the PET image quality by\nreducing statistical noise and preserved a contrast of brain structures and\ninserted tumor compared with other algorithms. In the preclinical experiment,\nfiner structures and better contrast recovery were obtained by the proposed\nmethod. This indicated that the proposed method can produce high-quality images\nwithout a prior training dataset. Thus, the proposed method is a key enabling\ntechnology for the straightforward and practical implementation of end-to-end\nDIP-based fully 3D PET image reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have shown a great ability at bridging the performance gap\nbetween predictive and generative approaches for speech enhancement. We have\nshown that they may even outperform their predictive counterparts for\nnon-additive corruption types or when they are evaluated on mismatched\nconditions. However, diffusion models suffer from a high computational burden,\nmainly as they require to run a neural network for each reverse diffusion step,\nwhereas predictive approaches only require one pass. As diffusion models are\ngenerative approaches they may also produce vocalizing and breathing artifacts\nin adverse conditions. In comparison, in such difficult scenarios, predictive\nmodels typically do not produce such artifacts but tend to distort the target\nspeech instead, thereby degrading the speech quality. In this work, we present\na stochastic regeneration approach where an estimate given by a predictive\nmodel is provided as a guide for further diffusion. We show that the proposed\napproach uses the predictive model to remove the vocalizing and breathing\nartifacts while producing very high quality samples thanks to the diffusion\nmodel, even in adverse conditions. We further show that this approach enables\nto use lighter sampling schemes with fewer diffusion steps without sacrificing\nquality, thus lifting the computational burden by an order of magnitude.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing (QC) promises significant advantages on certain hard\ncomputational tasks over classical computers. However, current quantum\nhardware, also known as noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ), are\nstill unable to carry out computations faithfully mainly because of the lack of\nquantum error correction (QEC) capability. A significant amount of theoretical\nstudies have provided various types of QEC codes; one of the notable\ntopological codes is the surface code, and its features, such as the\nrequirement of only nearest-neighboring two-qubit control gates and a large\nerror threshold, make it a leading candidate for scalable quantum computation.\nRecent developments of machine learning (ML)-based techniques especially the\nreinforcement learning (RL) methods have been applied to the decoding problem\nand have already made certain progress. Nevertheless, the device noise pattern\nmay change over time, making trained decoder models ineffective. In this paper,\nwe propose a continual reinforcement learning method to address these decoding\nchallenges. Specifically, we implement double deep Q-learning with\nprobabilistic policy reuse (DDQN-PPR) model to learn surface code decoding\nstrategies for quantum environments with varying noise patterns. Through\nnumerical simulations, we show that the proposed DDQN-PPR model can\nsignificantly reduce the computational complexity. Moreover, increasing the\nnumber of trained policies can further improve the agent's performance. Our\nresults open a way to build more capable RL agents which can leverage\npreviously gained knowledge to tackle QEC challenges.",
