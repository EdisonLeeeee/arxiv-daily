    "abstract": "As a common appearance defect of concrete bridges, cracks are important\nindices for bridge structure health assessment. Although there has been much\nresearch on crack identification, research on the evolution mechanism of bridge\ncracks is still far from practical applications. In this paper, the\nstate-of-the-art research on intelligent theories and methodologies for\nintelligent feature extraction, data fusion and crack detection based on\ndata-driven approaches is comprehensively reviewed. The research is discussed\nfrom three aspects: the feature extraction level of the multimodal parameters\nof bridge cracks, the description level and the diagnosis level of the bridge\ncrack damage states. We focus on previous research concerning the quantitative\ncharacterization problems of multimodal parameters of bridge cracks and their\nimplementation in crack identification, while highlighting some of their major\ndrawbacks. In addition, the current challenges and potential future research\ndirections are discussed.",

    "abstract": "With the research directions described in this thesis, we seek to address the\ncritical challenges in designing recommender systems that can understand the\ndynamics of continuous-time event sequences. We follow a ground-up approach,\ni.e., first, we address the problems that may arise due to the poor quality of\nCTES data being fed into a recommender system. Later, we handle the task of\ndesigning accurate recommender systems. To improve the quality of the CTES\ndata, we address a fundamental problem of overcoming missing events in temporal\nsequences. Moreover, to provide accurate sequence modeling frameworks, we\ndesign solutions for points-of-interest recommendation, i.e., models that can\nhandle spatial mobility data of users to various POI check-ins and recommend\ncandidate locations for the next check-in. Lastly, we highlight that the\ncapabilities of the proposed models can have applications beyond recommender\nsystems, and we extend their abilities to design solutions for large-scale CTES\nretrieval and human activity prediction. A significant part of this thesis uses\nthe idea of modeling the underlying distribution of CTES via neural marked\ntemporal point processes (MTPP). Traditional MTPP models are stochastic\nprocesses that utilize a fixed formulation to capture the generative mechanism\nof a sequence of discrete events localized in continuous time. In contrast,\nneural MTPP combine the underlying ideas from the point process literature with\nmodern deep learning architectures. The ability of deep-learning models as\naccurate function approximators has led to a significant gain in the predictive\nprowess of neural MTPP models. In this thesis, we utilize and present several\nneural network-based enhancements for the current MTPP frameworks for the\naforementioned real-world applications.",

    "title": "Novel Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Suppressing Synchronization  in Closed Loop Deep Brain Stimulators",
    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is marked by altered and increased firing characteristics\nof pathological oscillations in the brain. In other words, it causes abnormal\nsynchronous oscillations and suppression during neurological processing. In\norder to examine and regulate the synchronization and pathological oscillations\nin motor circuits, deep brain stimulators (DBS) are used. Although machine\nlearning methods have been applied for the investigation of suppression, these\nmodels require large amounts of training data and computational power, both of\nwhich pose challenges to resource-constrained DBS. This research proposes a\nnovel reinforcement learning (RL) framework for suppressing the synchronization\nin neuronal activity during episodes of neurological disorders with less power\nconsumption. The proposed RL algorithm comprises an ensemble of a temporal\nrepresentation of stimuli and a twin-delayed deep deterministic (TD3) policy\ngradient algorithm. We quantify the stability of the proposed framework to\nnoise and reduced synchrony using RL for three pathological signaling regimes:\nregular, chaotic, and bursting, and further eliminate the undesirable\noscillations. Furthermore, metrics such as evaluation rewards, energy supplied\nto the ensemble, and the mean point of convergence were used and compared to\nother RL algorithms, specifically the Advantage actor critic (A2C), the Actor\ncritic with Kronecker-featured trust region (ACKTR), and the Proximal policy\noptimization (PPO).",

    "abstract": "Traffic splitting is a required functionality in networks, for example for\nload balancing over paths or servers, or by the source's access restrictions.\nThe capacities of the servers (or the number of users with particular access\nrestrictions) determine the sizes of the parts into which traffic should be\nsplit. A recent approach implements traffic splitting within the ternary\ncontent addressable memory (TCAM), which is often available in switches. It is\nimportant to reduce the amount of memory allocated for this task since TCAMs\nare power consuming and are often also required for other tasks such as\nclassification and routing. In the longest-prefix model (LPM), Draves et al.\n(INFOCOM 1999) find a minimal representation of a function, and Sadeh et al.\n(INFOCOM 2019) find a minimal representation of a partition. In certain\nsituations, range-functions are of special interest, that is, all the addresses\nwith the same target, or action, are consecutive. In this paper we show that\nminimizing the amount of TCAM entries to represent a partition comes at the\ncost of fragmentation, such that for some partitions some actions must have\nmultiple ranges. Then, we also study the case where each target must have a\nsingle segment of addresses.",

The distortion has\na great influence on the structural performance and dimensional accuracy, e.g.,\nfor assembly. It is therefore of critical importance to model, predict and,\nultimately, reduce distortion. In this paper, we present a computational\nframework for fabrication sequence optimization to minimize distortion in\nmulti-axis additive manufacturing (e.g., robotic wire arc additive\nmanufacturing), in which the fabrication sequence is not limited to planar\nlayers only. We encode the fabrication sequence by a continuous pseudo-time\nfield, and optimize it using gradient-based numerical optimization. To\ndemonstrate this framework, we adopt a computationally tractable yet reasonably\naccurate model to mimic the material shrinkage in metal additive manufacturing\nand thus to predict the distortion of the fabricated components. Numerical\nstudies show that optimized curved layers can reduce distortion by orders of\nmagnitude as compared to their planar counterparts.",

These messages aim to obtain user credentials,\ninstall malware on the phones, or launch smishing attacks. They ask users to\nreply to their message, click on a URL that redirects them to a phishing\nwebsite, or call the provided number. Thousands of mobile users are affected by\nsmishing attacks daily. Drawing inspiration by the works of Tu et al. (USENIX\nSecurity, 2019) on Robocalls and Tischer et al. (IEEE Symposium on Security and\nPrivacy, 2016) on USB drives, this paper investigates why smishing works.\nAccordingly, we designed smishing experiments and sent phishing SMSes to 265\nusers to measure the efficacy of smishing attacks. We sent eight fake text\nmessages to participants and recorded their CLICK, REPLY, and CALL responses\nalong with their feedback in a post-test survey. Our results reveal that 16.92%\nof our participants had potentially fallen for our smishing attack. To test\nrepeat phishing, we subjected a set of randomly selected participants to a\nsecond round of smishing attacks with a different message than the one they\nreceived in the first round. As a result, we observed that 12.82% potentially\nfell for the attack again.

In specific, in the\ntraining process, the ID conditional DDPM is trained to generate face images\nwith the desired identity. In the sampling process, we use the off-the-shelf\nfacial expert models to make the model transfer source identity while\npreserving target attributes faithfully. During this process, to preserve the\nbackground of the target image and obtain the desired face swapping result, we\nadditionally propose a target-preserving blending strategy. It helps our model\nto keep the attributes of the target face from noise while transferring the\nsource facial identity. In addition, without any re-training, our model can\nflexibly apply additional facial guidance and adaptively control the\nID-attributes trade-off to achieve the desired results. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first approach that applies the diffusion model in face\nswapping task. Compared with previous GAN-based approaches, by taking advantage\nof the diffusion model for the face swapping task, DiffFace achieves better\nbenefits such as training stability, high fidelity, diversity of the samples,\nand controllability. Extensive experiments show that our DiffFace is comparable\nor superior to the state-of-the-art methods on several standard face swapping\nbenchmarks.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to introduce a new learning procedure for neural\nnetworks and to demonstrate that it works well enough on a few small problems\nto be worth further investigation. The Forward-Forward algorithm replaces the\nforward and backward passes of backpropagation by two forward passes, one with\npositive (i.e. real) data and the other with negative data which could be\ngenerated by the network itself. Each layer has its own objective function\nwhich is simply to have high goodness for positive data and low goodness for\nnegative data. The sum of the squared activities in a layer can be used as the\ngoodness but there are many other possibilities, including minus the sum of the\nsquared activities. If the positive and negative passes could be separated in\ntime, the negative passes could be done offline, which would make the learning\nmuch simpler in the positive pass and allow video to be pipelined through the\nnetwork without ever storing activities or stopping to propagate derivatives.",

    "abstract": "There are often situations where two remote users each have data, and wish to\n(i) verify the equality of their data, and (ii) whenever a discrepancy is found\nafterwards, determine which of the two modified his data. The most common\nexample is where they want to authenticate messages they exchange. Another\npossible example is where they have a huge database and its mirror in remote\nplaces, and whenever a discrepancy is found between their data, they can\ndetermine which of the two users is to blame. Of course, if one is allowed to\nuse computational assumptions, this function can be realized readily, e.g., by\nusing digital signatures. However, if one needs information-theoretic security,\nthere is no known method that realizes this function efficiently, i.e., with\nsecret key, communication, and trusted third parties all being sufficiently\nsmall. In order to realize this function efficiently with information-theoretic\nsecurity, we here define the ``equality-testing protocol with dispute\nresolution'' as a new framework. The most significant difference between our\nprotocol and the previous methods with similar functions is that we allow the\nintervention of a trusted third party when checking the equality of the data.\nIn this new framework, we also present an explicit protocol that is\ninformation-theoretically secure and efficient.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in the field of graph\nrepresentation learning. Standard GNNs define a local message-passing mechanism\nwhich propagates information over the whole graph domain by stacking multiple\nlayers. This paradigm suffers from two major limitations, over-squashing and\npoor long-range dependencies, that can be solved using global attention but\nsignificantly increases the computational cost to quadratic complexity. In this\nwork, we propose an alternative approach to overcome these structural\nlimitations by leveraging the ViT/MLP-Mixer architectures introduced in\ncomputer vision. We introduce a new class of GNNs, called Graph MLP-Mixer, that\nholds three key properties. First, they capture long-range dependency and\nmitigate the issue of over-squashing as demonstrated on the Long Range Graph\nBenchmark (LRGB) and the TreeNeighbourMatch datasets. Second, they offer better\nspeed and memory efficiency with a complexity linear to the number of nodes and\nedges, surpassing the related Graph Transformer and expressive GNN models.\nThird, they show high expressivity in terms of graph isomorphism as they can\ndistinguish at least 3-WL non-isomorphic graphs. We test our architecture on 4\nsimulated datasets and 7 real-world benchmarks, and show highly competitive\nresults on all of them.",

    "abstract": "Configurable software systems are employed in many important application\ndomains. Understanding the performance of the systems under all configurations\nis critical to prevent potential performance issues caused by misconfiguration.\nHowever, as the number of configurations can be prohibitively large, it is not\npossible to measure the system performance under all configurations. Thus, a\ncommon approach is to build a prediction model from a limited measurement data\nto predict the performance of all configurations as scalar values. However, it\nhas been pointed out that there are different sources of uncertainty coming\nfrom the data collection or the modeling process, which can make the scalar\npredictions not certainly accurate. To address this problem, we propose a\nBayesian deep learning based method, namely BDLPerf, that can incorporate\nuncertainty into the prediction model. BDLPerf can provide both scalar\npredictions for configurations' performance and the corresponding confidence\nintervals of these scalar predictions. We also develop a novel uncertainty\ncalibration technique to ensure the reliability of the confidence intervals\ngenerated by a Bayesian prediction model. Finally, we suggest an efficient\nhyperparameter tuning technique so as to train the prediction model within a\nreasonable amount of time whilst achieving high accuracy. Our experimental\nresults on 10 real-world systems show that BDLPerf achieves higher accuracy\nthan existing approaches, in both scalar performance prediction and confidence\ninterval estimation.",

    "abstract": "Compact block, which replaces transactions in the block with their hashes, is\nan effective means to speed up block propagation in the Bitcoin network. The\ncompact block mechanism in Bitcoin counts on the fact that many nodes may\nalready have the transactions (or most of the transactions) in the block,\ntherefore sending the complete block containing the full transactions is\nunnecessary. This fact, however, does not hold in the Ethereum network.\nAdopting compact block directly in Ethereum may degrade the block propagation\nspeed significantly because the probability of a node not having a transaction\nin the sending block is relatively high in Ethereum and requesting the missing\ntransactions after receiving the compact block takes much additional time. This\npaper proposes hybrid-compact block (HCB), an efficient compact block\npropagation scheme for Ethereum and other similar blockchains. First, we\ndevelop a Secondary Pool to store the low-fee transactions, which are removed\nfrom the primary transaction pool, to conserve storage space. As simple\nauxiliary storage, the Secondary Pool does not affect the normal block\nprocessing of the primary pool in Ethereum. Second, we design a machine\nlearning-based transaction prediction module to precisely predict the missing\ntransactions caused by network latency and selfish behaviors. We implemented\nour HCB scheme and other compact-block-like schemes (as benchmarks) and\ndeployed a number of worldwide nodes over the Ethereum MainNet to\nexperimentally investigate them.

    "abstract": "Global power systems are increasingly reliant on wind energy as a mitigation\nstrategy for climate change. However, the variability of wind energy causes\nsystem reliability to erode, resulting in the wind being curtailed and,\nultimately, leading to substantial economic losses for wind farm owners. Wind\ncurtailment can be reduced using battery energy storage systems (BESS) that\nserve as onsite backup sources. Yet, this auxiliary role may significantly\nhamper the BESS's capacity to generate revenues from the electricity market,\nparticularly in conducting energy arbitrage in the Spot market and providing\nfrequency control ancillary services (FCAS) in the FCAS markets. Ideal BESS\nscheduling should effectively balance the BESS's role in absorbing onsite wind\ncurtailment and trading in the electricity market, but it is difficult in\npractice because of the underlying coordination complexity and the stochastic\nnature of energy prices and wind generation. In this study, we investigate the\nbidding strategy of a wind-battery system co-located and participating\nsimultaneously in both the Spot and Regulation FCAS markets. We propose a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach that decouples the market\nparticipation of the wind-battery system into two related Markov decision\nprocesses for each facility, enabling the BESS to absorb onsite wind\ncurtailment while simultaneously bidding in the wholesale Spot and FCAS markets\nto maximize overall operational revenues. Using realistic wind farm data, we\nvalidated the coordinated bidding strategy for the wind-battery system and find\nthat our strategy generates significantly higher revenue and responds better to\nwind curtailment compared to an optimization-based benchmark. Our results show\nthat joint-market bidding can significantly improve the financial performance\nof wind-battery systems compared to individual market participation.",

    "abstract": "Scientists and philosophers have debated whether humans can trust advanced\nartificial intelligence (AI) agents to respect humanity's best interests. Yet\nwhat about the reverse? Will advanced AI agents trust humans? Gauging an AI\nagent's trust in humans is challenging because--absent costs for\ndishonesty--such agents might respond falsely about their trust in humans. Here\nwe present a method for incentivizing machine decisions without altering an AI\nagent's underlying algorithms or goal orientation. In two separate experiments,\nwe then employ this method in hundreds of trust games between an AI agent (a\nLarge Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI) and a human experimenter (author TJ).\nIn our first experiment, we find that the AI agent decides to trust humans at\nhigher rates when facing actual incentives than when making hypothetical\ndecisions. Our second experiment replicates and extends these findings by\nautomating game play and by homogenizing question wording. We again observe\nhigher rates of trust when the AI agent faces real incentives. Across both\nexperiments, the AI agent's trust decisions appear unrelated to the magnitude\nof stakes. Furthermore, to address the possibility that the AI agent's trust\ndecisions reflect a preference for uncertainty, the experiments include two\nconditions that present the AI agent with a non-social decision task that\nprovides the opportunity to choose a certain or uncertain option; in those\nconditions, the AI agent consistently chooses the certain option. Our\nexperiments suggest that one of the most advanced AI language models to date\nalters its social behavior in response to incentives and displays behavior\nconsistent with trust toward a human interlocutor when incentivized.",

The users' transmission scheduling is firstly\ndetermined by the outer-loop DRL approach, e.g. the DQN or PPO algorithm, and\nthen the inner-loop optimization is used to adapt either the uplink information\ntransmission or downlink energy transfer to all nodes. A simple and efficient\napproximation is also proposed to reduce the inner-loop rum time overhead.\nNumerical results verify that the hierarchical learning framework outperforms\ntypical baselines in terms of the average AoI and proportional fairness among\ndifferent nodes.",

    "abstract": "As language models have grown in parameters and layers, it has become much\nharder to train and infer with them on single GPUs. This is severely\nrestricting the availability of large language models such as GPT-3,\nBERT-Large, and many others. A common technique to solve this problem is\npruning the network architecture by removing transformer heads, fully-connected\nweights, and other modules. The main challenge is to discern the important\nparameters from the less important ones. Our goal is to find strong metrics for\nidentifying such parameters. We thus propose two strategies: Cam-Cut based on\nthe GradCAM interpretations, and Smooth-Cut based on the SmoothGrad, for\ncalculating the importance scores. Through this work, we show that our scoring\nfunctions are able to assign more relevant task-based scores to the network\nparameters, and thus both our pruning approaches significantly outperform the\nstandard weight and gradient-based strategies, especially at higher compression\nratios in BERT-based models. We also analyze our pruning masks and find them to\nbe significantly different from the ones obtained using standard metrics.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we employ multiple UAVs coordinated by a base station (BS) to\nhelp the ground users (GUs) to offload their sensing data. Different UAVs can\nadapt their trajectories and network formation to expedite data transmissions\nvia multi-hop relaying. The trajectory planning aims to collect all GUs' data,\nwhile the UAVs' network formation optimizes the multi-hop UAV network topology\nto minimize the energy consumption and transmission delay. The joint network\nformation and trajectory optimization is solved by a two-step iterative\napproach. Firstly, we devise the adaptive network formation scheme by using a\nheuristic algorithm to balance the UAVs' energy consumption and data queue\nsize. Then, with the fixed network formation, the UAVs' trajectories are\nfurther optimized by using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning without\nknowing the GUs' traffic demands and spatial distribution. To improve the\nlearning efficiency, we further employ Bayesian optimization to estimate the\nUAVs' flying decisions based on historical trajectory points. This helps avoid\ninefficient action explorations and improves the convergence rate in the model\ntraining. The simulation results reveal close spatial-temporal couplings\nbetween the UAVs' trajectory planning and network formation.

One generalizes the notion of graph conductance to hypergraph\nconductance [LM16, CLTZ18]. In the second approach one can view a hypergraph as\na simplicial complex and study its various topological properties [LM06, MW09,\nDKW16, PR17] and spectral properties [KM17, DK17, KO18a, KO18b, Opp20].\nIn this work, we attempt to bridge these two directions of study by relating\nthe spectrum of up-down walks and swap-walks on the simplicial complex to\nhypergraph expansion. In surprising contrast to random-walks on graphs, we show\nthat the spectral gap of swap-walks can not be used to infer any bounds on\nhypergraph conductance. For the up-down walks, we show that spectral gap of\nwalks between levels $m, l$ satisfying $1 < m < l$ can not be used to bound\nhypergraph expansion. We give a Cheeger-like inequality relating the spectral\nof walks between level 1 and $l$ to hypergraph expansion.\nFinally, we also give a construction to show that the well-studied notion of\nlink expansion in simplicial complexes can not be used to bound hypergraph\nexpansion in a Cheeger like manner.",

By employing this\nsensor, feedback controllers are implemented to reduce the impact forces during\nthe transition of the swing to stance phase or steeping on inclined unseen\nobstacles.

The walking\nexperiments show successful locomotion on the unseen inclined obstacle without\nreducing the locomotion speed with a slope angle of 12.

Typically, referring expressions contain\ncomplex relationships between the target and its surrounding objects. The main\nchallenge of this task is to understand the visual and linguistic content\nsimultaneously and to find the referred object accurately among all instances\nin the image. Currently, the most effective way to solve the above problem is\nto obtain aligned multi-modal features by computing the correlation between\nvisual and linguistic feature modalities under the supervision of the\nground-truth mask. However, existing paradigms have difficulty in thoroughly\nunderstanding visual and linguistic content due to the inability to perceive\ninformation directly about surrounding objects that refer to the target.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning is a popular and powerful method for utilizing large\namounts of unlabeled data, for which a wide variety of training objectives have\nbeen proposed in the literature. In this study, we perform a Bayesian analysis\nof state-of-the-art self-supervised learning objectives and propose a unified\nformulation based on likelihood learning. Our analysis suggests a simple method\nfor integrating self-supervised learning with generative models, allowing for\nthe joint training of these two seemingly distinct approaches. We refer to this\ncombined framework as GEDI, which stands for GEnerative and DIscriminative\ntraining. Additionally, we demonstrate an instantiation of the GEDI framework\nby integrating an energy-based model with a cluster-based self-supervised\nlearning model. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including\nSVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, we show that GEDI outperforms existing\nself-supervised learning strategies in terms of clustering performance by a\nwide margin. We also demonstrate that GEDI can be integrated into a\nneural-symbolic framework to address tasks in the small data regime, where it\ncan use logical constraints to further improve clustering and classification\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "The future of population-based breast cancer screening is likely personalized\nstrategies based on clinically relevant risk models. Mammography-based risk\nmodels should remain robust to domain shifts caused by different populations\nand mammographic devices. Modern risk models do not ensure adaptation across\nvendor-domains and are often conflated to unintentionally rely on both\nprecursors of cancer and systemic/global mammographic information associated\nwith short- and long-term risk, respectively, which might limit performance. We\ndeveloped a robust, cross-vendor model for long-term risk assessment. An\naugmentation-based domain adaption technique, based on flavorization of\nmammographic views, ensured generalization to an unseen vendor-domain. We\ntrained on samples without diagnosed/potential malignant findings to learn\nsystemic/global breast tissue features, called mammographic texture, indicative\nof future breast cancer. However, training so may cause erratic convergence. By\nexcluding noise-inducing samples and designing a case-control dataset, a robust\nensemble texture model was trained. This model was validated in two independent\ndatasets. In 66,607 Danish women with flavorized Siemens views, the AUC was\n0.71 and 0.65 for prediction of interval cancers within two years (ICs) and\nfrom two years after screening (LTCs), respectively. In a combination with\nestablished risk factors, the model's AUC increased to 0.68 for LTCs. In 25,706\nDutch women with Hologic-processed views, the AUCs were not different from the\nAUCs in Danish women with flavorized views. The results suggested that the\nmodel robustly estimated long-term risk while adapting to an unseen processed\nvendor-domain. The model identified 8.1% of Danish women accounting for 20.9%\nof ICs and 14.2% of LTCs.",

In contrast to prior work, in our architecture\na pair of PCR primers of length 20 does not define a single object, but an\nindependent storage partition, which is internally managed in an independent\nway with its own index structure. We make the observation that, while the\nnumber of mutually compatible primer pairs is limited, the internal address\nspace available to any pair of primers (i.e., partition) is virtually\nunlimited. We expose and leverage the flexibility with which this address space\ncan be managed to provide rich and functional storage semantics, such as\nhierarchical data organization and efficient and flexible implementations of\ndata updates. Furthermore, to leverage the full power of the prefix-based\nnature of PCR addressing, we define a methodology for transforming an arbitrary\nindexing scheme into a PCR-compatible equivalent. This allows us to run PCR\nwith primers that can be variably extended to include a desired part of the\nindex, and thus narrow down the scope of the reaction to retrieve a specific\nobject (e.g., file or directory) within the partition with high precision.

The\nexploration bonus is obtained from the strangeness and the proposed exploration\nmethod is not much affected by stochastic transitions commonly observed in MARL\ntasks. To prevent a high exploration bonus from making the MARL training\ninsensitive to extrinsic rewards, we also propose a separate action-value\nfunction trained by both extrinsic reward and exploration bonus, on which a\nbehavioral policy to generate transitions is designed based. It makes the\nCTDE-based MARL algorithms more stable when they are used with an exploration\nmethod.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach called TegFormer which\nutilizes the Transformer architecture where the encoder is enriched with\ndomain-specific contexts while the decoder is enhanced by a large-scale\npre-trained language model. Specifically, a \\emph{Topic-Extension} layer\ncapturing the interaction between the given topics and their domain-specific\ncontexts is plugged into the encoder. Since the given topics are usually\nconcise and sparse, such an additional layer can bring more topic-related\nsemantics in to facilitate the subsequent natural language generation.\nMoreover, an \\emph{Embedding-Fusion} module that combines the domain-specific\nword embeddings learnt from the given corpus and the general-purpose word\nembeddings provided by a GPT-2 model pre-trained on massive text data is\nintegrated into the decoder. Since GPT-2 is at a much larger scale, it contains\na lot more implicit linguistic knowledge which would help the decoder to\nproduce more grammatical and readable text. Extensive experiments have shown\nthat the pieces of text generated by TegFormer have better topic coverage and\nhigher text coherence than those from SOTA topic-to-essay techniques, according\nto automatic and human evaluations.

    "abstract": "Neural style transfer is a deep learning technique that produces an\nunprecedentedly rich style transfer from a style image to a content image and\nis particularly impressive when it comes to transferring style from a painting\nto an image. It was originally achieved by solving an optimization problem to\nmatch the global style statistics of the style image while preserving the local\ngeometric features of the content image. The two main drawbacks of this\noriginal approach is that it is computationally expensive and that the\nresolution of the output images is limited by high GPU memory requirements.\nMany solutions have been proposed to both accelerate neural style transfer and\nincrease its resolution, but they all compromise the quality of the produced\nimages. Indeed, transferring the style of a painting is a complex task\ninvolving features at different scales, from the color palette and\ncompositional style to the fine brushstrokes and texture of the canvas. This\npaper provides a solution to solve the original global optimization for\nultra-high resolution images, enabling multiscale style transfer at\nunprecedented image sizes. This is achieved by spatially localizing the\ncomputation of each forward and backward passes through the VGG network.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons show that our method\nproduces a style transfer of unmatched quality for such high resolution\npainting styles.",

    "abstract": "A well-established approach for inferring full displacement and stress fields\nfrom possibly sparse data is to calibrate the parameter of a given constitutive\nmodel using a Bayesian update. After calibration, a (stochastic) forward\nsimulation is conducted with the identified model parameters to resolve\nphysical fields in regions that were not accessible to the measurement device.\nA shortcoming of model calibration is that the model is deemed to best\nrepresent reality, which is only sometimes the case, especially in the context\nof the aging of structures and materials. While this issue is often addressed\nwith repeated model calibration, a different approach is followed in the\nrecently proposed statistical Finite Element Method (statFEM). Instead of using\nBayes' theorem to update model parameters, the displacement is chosen as the\nstochastic prior and updated to fit the measurement data more closely. For this\npurpose, the statFEM framework introduces a so-called model-reality mismatch,\nparametrized by only three hyperparameters. This makes the inference of\nfull-field data computationally efficient in an online stage: If the stochastic\nprior can be computed offline, solving the underlying partial differential\nequation (PDE) online is unnecessary. Compared to solving a PDE, identifying\nonly three hyperparameters and conditioning the state on the sensor data\nrequires much fewer computational resources.\nThis paper presents two contributions to the existing statFEM approach:\nFirst, we use a non-intrusive polynomial chaos method to compute the prior,\nenabling the use of complex mechanical models in deterministic formulations.\nSecond, we examine the influence of prior material models (linear elastic and\nSt.Venant Kirchhoff material with uncertain Young's modulus) on the updated\nsolution.

Our paper addresses this gap by focusing on\nnon-linear two-layer autoencoders trained in the challenging proportional\nregime in which the input dimension scales linearly with the size of the\nrepresentation. Our results characterize the minimizers of the population risk,\nand show that such minimizers are achieved by gradient methods; their structure\nis also unveiled, thus leading to a concise description of the features\nobtained via training.

To\naddress these challenges, a comprehensive scheduling framework is proposed by\nintroducing a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach based on\nmodeling an island integrated energy system (IES). In response to the shortage\nof freshwater on islands, in addition to the introduction of seawater\ndesalination systems, a transmission structure of \"hydrothermal simultaneous\ntransmission\" (HST) is proposed. The essence of the IES scheduling problem is\nthe optimal combination of each unit's output, which is a typical timing\ncontrol problem and conforms to the Markov decision-making solution framework\nof deep reinforcement learning. Deep reinforcement learning adapts to various\nchanges and timely adjusts strategies through the interaction of agents and the\nenvironment, avoiding complicated modeling and prediction of\nmulti-uncertainties. The simulation results show that the proposed scheduling\nframework properly handles multi-uncertainties from power sources and loads,\nachieves a stable demand supply for various resources, and has better\nperformance than other real-time scheduling methods, especially in terms of\ncomputational efficiency. In addition, the HST model constitutes an active\nexploration to improve the utilization efficiency of island freshwater.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) have found remarkable applicability and\nsuccess in various robotic tasks, which can be mainly attributed to their\ngeneralization and robustness properties. Nevertheless, their generalization is\nbased only on the trajectory endpoints (initial and target position). Moreover,\nthe spatial generalization of DMP is known to suffer from shortcomings like\nover-scaling and mirroring of the motion. In this work we propose a novel\ngeneralization scheme, based on optimizing online the DMP weights so that the\nacceleration profile and hence the underlying training trajectory pattern is\npreserved. This approach remedies the shortcomings of the classical DMP scaling\nand additionally allows the DMP to generalize also to intermediate points\n(via-points) and external signals (coupling terms), while preserving the\ntraining trajectory pattern. Extensive comparative simulations with the\nclassical and other DMP variants are conducted, while experimental results\nvalidate the applicability and efficacy of the proposed method.",

However, more and more teachers are developing their own apps to\naddress issues not covered by existing m-learning apps. In this article, by\nmeans of a systematic literature review that covers 62 publications placed in\nthe hype of teacher-created m-learning apps (between 2012 and 2017, the early\nadopters) and the usage of 71 apps, we have analysed the use of specific\nm-learning apps.

The experiences analysed only develop low\nlevel outcomes and the results obtained are positive improving learning,\nlearning performance, and attitude. As a conclusion of this study is that the\nresults obtained with specific developed apps are quite similar to previous\ngeneral surveys and that the development of long-term experiences are required\nto determine the real effect of instructional designs based on mobile devices.\nThese designs should also be oriented to evaluate high level skills and take\nadvantage of mobile features of mobile devices to develop learning activities\nthat be made anytime at anyplace and taking into account context and realistic\nsituations.

    "abstract": "People with diabetes are more likely to develop diabetic retinopathy (DR)\nthan healthy people. However, DR is the leading cause of blindness. At present,\nthe diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy mainly relies on the experienced\nclinician to recognize the fine features in color fundus images. This is a\ntime-consuming task. Therefore, in this paper, to promote the development of\nUW-OCTA DR automatic detection, we propose a novel semi-supervised semantic\nsegmentation method for UW-OCTA DR image grade assessment. This method, first,\nuses the MAE algorithm to perform semi-supervised pre-training on the UW-OCTA\nDR grade assessment dataset to mine the supervised information in the UW-OCTA\nimages, thereby alleviating the need for labeled data. Secondly, to more fully\nmine the lesion features of each region in the UW-OCTA image, this paper\nconstructs a cross-algorithm ensemble DR tissue segmentation algorithm by\ndeploying three algorithms with different visual feature processing strategies.\nThe algorithm contains three sub-algorithms, namely pre-trained MAE, ConvNeXt,\nand SegFormer. Based on the initials of these three sub-algorithms, the\nalgorithm can be named MCS-DRNet. Finally, we use the MCS-DRNet algorithm as an\ninspector to check and revise the results of the preliminary evaluation of the\nDR grade evaluation algorithm. The experimental results show that the mean dice\nsimilarity coefficient of MCS-DRNet v1 and v2 are 0.5161 and 0.5544,\nrespectively. The quadratic weighted kappa of the DR grading evaluation is\n0.7559. Our code will be released soon.",

    "abstract": "Transformers have recently gained attention in the computer vision domain due\nto their ability to model long-range dependencies. However, the self-attention\nmechanism, which is the core part of the Transformer model, usually suffers\nfrom quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of tokens.\nMany architectures attempt to reduce model complexity by limiting the\nself-attention mechanism to local regions or by redesigning the tokenization\nprocess. In this paper, we propose DAE-Former, a novel method that seeks to\nprovide an alternative perspective by efficiently designing the self-attention\nmechanism. More specifically, we reformulate the self-attention mechanism to\ncapture both spatial and channel relations across the whole feature dimension\nwhile staying computationally efficient. Furthermore, we redesign the skip\nconnection path by including the cross-attention module to ensure the feature\nreusability and enhance the localization power. Our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on multi-organ cardiac and skin lesion segmentation\ndatasets without requiring pre-training weights.

Regarding this latter application, detecting\nanomalies in an industrial plant's status firstly prevents serious damages that\nwould require a long interruption of the production process. Secondly, it\npermits optimal scheduling of maintenance interventions by limiting them to\nurgent situations. At the same time, they typically follow a fixed prudential\nschedule according to which components are substituted well before the end of\ntheir expected lifetime.

    "abstract": "We study the composition style in deep image matting, a notion that\ncharacterizes a data generation flow on how to exploit limited foregrounds and\nrandom backgrounds to form a training dataset. Prior art executes this flow in\na completely random manner by simply going through the foreground pool or by\noptionally combining two foregrounds before foreground-background composition.\nIn this work, we first show that naive foreground combination can be\nproblematic and therefore derive an alternative formulation to reasonably\ncombine foregrounds. Our second contribution is an observation that matting\nperformance can benefit from a certain occurrence frequency of combined\nforegrounds and their associated source foregrounds during training. Inspired\nby this, we introduce a novel composition style that binds the source and\ncombined foregrounds in a definite triplet. In addition, we also find that\ndifferent orders of foreground combination lead to different foreground\npatterns, which further inspires a quadruplet-based composition style. Results\nunder controlled experiments on four matting baselines show that our\ncomposition styles outperform existing ones and invite consistent performance\nimprovement on both composited and real-world datasets.

    "abstract": "The demand of high-resolution video contents has grown over the years.\nHowever, the delivery of high-resolution video is constrained by either\ncomputational resources required for rendering or network bandwidth for remote\ntransmission. To remedy this limitation, we leverage the eye trackers found\nalongside existing augmented and virtual reality headsets. We propose the\napplication of video super-resolution (VSR) technique to fuse low-resolution\ncontext with regional high-resolution context for resource-constrained\nconsumption of high-resolution content without perceivable drop in quality. Eye\ntrackers provide us the gaze direction of a user, aiding us in the extraction\nof the regional high-resolution context. As only pixels that falls within the\ngaze region can be resolved by the human eye, a large amount of the delivered\ncontent is redundant as we can't perceive the difference in quality of the\nregion beyond the observed region. To generate a visually pleasing frame from\nthe fusion of high-resolution region and low-resolution region, we study the\ncapability of a deep neural network of transferring the context of the observed\nregion to other regions (low-resolution) of the current and future frames. We\nlabel this task a Foveated Video Super-Resolution (FVSR), as we need to\nsuper-resolve the low-resolution regions of current and future frames through\nthe fusion of pixels from the gaze region. We propose Cross-Resolution Flow\nPropagation (CRFP) for FVSR. We train and evaluate CRFP on REDS dataset on the\ntask of 8x FVSR, i.e. a combination of 8x VSR and the fusion of foveated\nregion. Departing from the conventional evaluation of per frame quality using\nSSIM or PSNR, we propose the evaluation of past foveated region, measuring the\ncapability of a model to leverage the noise present in eye trackers during\nFVSR.

    "title": "Enhancing Federated Learning with spectrum allocation optimization and  device selection",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is a widely accepted means for supporting customized\nservices for mobile devices and applications. Federated Learning (FL), which is\na promising approach to implement machine learning while addressing data\nprivacy concerns, typically involves a large number of wireless mobile devices\nto collect model training data. Under such circumstances, FL is expected to\nmeet stringent training latency requirements in the face of limited resources\nsuch as demand for wireless bandwidth, power consumption, and computation\nconstraints of participating devices. Due to practical considerations, FL\nselects a portion of devices to participate in the model training process at\neach iteration. Therefore, the tasks of efficient resource management and\ndevice selection will have a significant impact on the practical uses of FL. In\nthis paper, we propose a spectrum allocation optimization mechanism for\nenhancing FL over a wireless mobile network. Specifically, the proposed\nspectrum allocation optimization mechanism minimizes the time delay of FL while\nconsidering the energy consumption of individual participating devices; thus\nensuring that all the participating devices have sufficient resources to train\ntheir local models. In this connection, to ensure fast convergence of FL, a\nrobust device selection is also proposed to help FL reach convergence swiftly,\nespecially when the local datasets of the devices are not independent and\nidentically distributed (non-iid). Experimental results show that (1) the\nproposed spectrum allocation optimization method optimizes time delay while\nsatisfying the individual energy constraints; (2) the proposed device selection\nmethod enables FL to achieve the fastest convergence on non-iid datasets.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection on time series data is increasingly common across various\nindustrial domains that monitor metrics in order to prevent potential accidents\nand economic losses. However, a scarcity of labeled data and ambiguous\ndefinitions of anomalies can complicate these efforts. Recent unsupervised\nmachine learning methods have made remarkable progress in tackling this problem\nusing either single-timestamp predictions or time series reconstructions. While\ntraditionally considered separately, these methods are not mutually exclusive\nand can offer complementary perspectives on anomaly detection. This paper first\nhighlights the successes and limitations of prediction-based and\nreconstruction-based methods with visualized time series signals and anomaly\nscores. We then propose AER (Auto-encoder with Regression), a joint model that\ncombines a vanilla auto-encoder and an LSTM regressor to incorporate the\nsuccesses and address the limitations of each method. Our model can produce\nbi-directional predictions while simultaneously reconstructing the original\ntime series by optimizing a joint objective function. Furthermore, we propose\nseveral ways of combining the prediction and reconstruction errors through a\nseries of ablation studies. Finally, we compare the performance of the AER\narchitecture against two prediction-based methods and three\nreconstruction-based methods on 12 well-known univariate time series datasets\nfrom NASA, Yahoo, Numenta, and UCR. The results show that AER has the highest\naveraged F1 score across all datasets (a 23.5% improvement compared to ARIMA)\nwhile retaining a runtime similar to its vanilla auto-encoder and regressor\ncomponents. Our model is available in Orion, an open-source benchmarking tool\nfor time series anomaly detection.",

    "abstract": "Image captioning is one of the straightforward tasks that can take advantage\nof large-scale web-crawled data which provides rich knowledge about the visual\nworld for a captioning model. However, since web-crawled data contains\nimage-text pairs that are aligned at different levels, the inherent noises\n(e.g., misaligned pairs) make it difficult to learn a precise captioning model.\nWhile the filtering strategy can effectively remove noisy data, however, it\nleads to a decrease in learnable knowledge and sometimes brings about a new\nproblem of data deficiency. To take the best of both worlds, we propose a\nnoise-aware learning framework, which learns rich knowledge from the whole\nweb-crawled data while being less affected by the noises. This is achieved by\nthe proposed quality controllable model, which is learned using alignment\nlevels of the image-text pairs as an additional control signal during training.\nThe alignment-conditioned training allows the model to generate high-quality\ncaptions of well-aligned by simply setting the control signal to desired\nalignment level at inference time. Through in-depth analysis, we show that our\ncontrollable captioning model is effective in handling noise. In addition, with\ntwo tasks of zero-shot captioning and text-to-image retrieval using generated\ncaptions (i.e., self-retrieval), we also demonstrate our model can produce\nhigh-quality captions in terms of descriptiveness and distinctiveness.

For instance, it is used locally, as part of\na sensor system, on the edge for low-latency high-performance inference, or in\nthe cloud, e.g. for data mining. Modern complex systems, such as connected\nvehicles, are often part of an Internet of Things (IoT). To manage complexity,\narchitectures are described with architecture frameworks, which are composed of\na number of architectural views connected through correspondence rules. Despite\nsome attempts, the definition of a mathematical foundation for architecture\nframeworks that are suitable for the development of distributed AI systems\nstill requires investigation and study. In this paper, we propose to extend the\nstate of the art on architecture framework by providing a mathematical model\nfor system architectures, which is scalable and supports co-evolution of\ndifferent aspects for example of an AI system. Based on Design Science\nResearch, this study starts by identifying the challenges with architectural\nframeworks. Then, we derive from the identified challenges four rules and we\nformulate them by exploiting concepts from category theory. We show how\ncompositional thinking can provide rules for the creation and management of\narchitectural frameworks for complex systems, for example distributed systems\nwith AI. The aim of the paper is not to provide viewpoints or architecture\nmodels specific to AI systems, but instead to provide guidelines based on a\nmathematical formulation on how a consistent framework can be built up with\nexisting, or newly created, viewpoints. To put in practice and test the\napproach, the identified and formulated rules are applied to derive an\narchitectural framework for the EU Horizon 2020 project ``Very efficient deep\nlearning in the IoT\" (VEDLIoT) in the form of a case study.",

    "title": "Semi-supervised multiscale dual-encoding method for faulty traffic data  detection",
    "abstract": "Inspired by the recent success of deep learning in multiscale information\nencoding, we introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) based semi-supervised\nmethod for detection of faulty traffic data, which is cast as a classification\nproblem. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is applied to the time series of\ntraffic volume data to obtain rich features embodied in time-frequency\nrepresentation, followed by a twin of VAE models to separately encode normal\ndata and faulty data. The resulting multiscale dual encodings are concatenated\nand fed to an attention-based classifier, consisting of a self-attention module\nand a multilayer perceptron. For comparison, the proposed architecture is\nevaluated against five different encoding schemes, including (1) VAE with only\nnormal data encoding, (2) VAE with only faulty data encoding, (3) VAE with both\nnormal and faulty data encodings, but without attention module in the\nclassifier, (4) siamese encoding, and (5) cross-vision transformer (CViT)\nencoding. The first four encoding schemes adopted the same convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) architecture while the fifth encoding scheme follows the\ntransformer architecture of CViT. Our experiments show that the proposed\narchitecture with the dual encoding scheme, coupled with attention module,\noutperforms other encoding schemes and results in classification accuracy of\n96.4%, precision of 95.5%, and recall of 97.7%.",

    "title": "Sensing-Throughput Tradeoffs with Generative Adversarial Networks for  NextG Spectrum Sharing",
    "abstract": "Spectrum coexistence is essential for next generation (NextG) systems to\nshare the spectrum with incumbent (primary) users and meet the growing demand\nfor bandwidth. One example is the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service\n(CBRS) band, where the 5G and beyond communication systems need to sense the\nspectrum and then access the channel in an opportunistic manner when the\nincumbent user (e.g., radar) is not transmitting. To that end, a high-fidelity\nclassifier based on a deep neural network is needed for low misdetection (to\nprotect incumbent users) and low false alarm (to achieve high throughput for\nNextG). In a dynamic wireless environment, the classifier can only be used for\na limited period of time, i.e., coherence time. A portion of this period is\nused for learning to collect sensing results and train a classifier, and the\nrest is used for transmissions. In spectrum sharing systems, there is a\nwell-known tradeoff between the sensing time and the transmission time. While\nincreasing the sensing time can increase the spectrum sensing accuracy, there\nis less time left for data transmissions. In this paper, we present a\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) approach to generate synthetic sensing\nresults to augment the training data for the deep learning classifier so that\nthe sensing time can be reduced (and thus the transmission time can be\nincreased) while keeping high accuracy of the classifier. We consider both\nadditive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh channels, and show that this\nGAN-based approach can significantly improve both the protection of the\nhigh-priority user and the throughput of the NextG user (more in Rayleigh\nchannels than AWGN channels).",

    "abstract": "An expansion of aberrant brain cells is referred to as a brain tumor. The\nbrain's architecture is extremely intricate, with several regions controlling\nvarious nervous system processes. Any portion of the brain or skull can develop\na brain tumor, including the brain's protective coating, the base of the skull,\nthe brainstem, the sinuses, the nasal cavity, and many other places. Over the\npast ten years, numerous developments in the field of computer-aided brain\ntumor diagnosis have been made. Recently, instance segmentation has attracted a\nlot of interest in numerous computer vision applications. It seeks to assign\nvarious IDs to various scene objects, even if they are members of the same\nclass. Typically, a two-stage pipeline is used to perform instance\nsegmentation. This study shows brain cancer segmentation using YOLOv5. Yolo\ntakes dataset as picture format and corresponding text file. You Only Look Once\n(YOLO) is a viral and widely used algorithm. YOLO is famous for its object\nrecognition properties. You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a popular algorithm that\nhas gone viral. YOLO is well known for its ability to identify objects. YOLO\nV2, V3, V4, and V5 are some of the YOLO latest versions that experts have\npublished in recent years. Early brain tumor detection is one of the most\nimportant jobs that neurologists and radiologists have. However, it can be\ndifficult and error-prone to manually identify and segment brain tumors from\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. For making an early diagnosis of the\ncondition, an automated brain tumor detection system is necessary. The model of\nthe research paper has three classes. They are respectively Meningioma,\nPituitary, Glioma. The results show that, our model achieves competitive\naccuracy, in terms of runtime usage of M2 10 core GPU.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to different tasks such\nas bioinformatics, drug design, and social networks. However, recent studies\nhave shown that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which aim to mislead\nthe node or subgraph classification prediction by adding subtle perturbations.\nDetecting these attacks is challenging due to the small magnitude of\nperturbation and the discrete nature of graph data. In this paper, we propose a\ngeneral adversarial edge detection pipeline EDoG without requiring knowledge of\nthe attack strategies based on graph generation. Specifically, we propose a\nnovel graph generation approach combined with link prediction to detect\nsuspicious adversarial edges. To effectively train the graph generative model,\nwe sample several sub-graphs from the given graph data. We show that since the\nnumber of adversarial edges is usually low in practice, with low probability\nthe sampled sub-graphs will contain adversarial edges based on the union bound.\nIn addition, considering the strong attacks which perturb a large number of\nedges, we propose a set of novel features to perform outlier detection as the\npreprocessing for our detection. Extensive experimental results on three\nreal-world graph datasets including a private transaction rule dataset from a\nmajor company and two types of synthetic graphs with controlled properties show\nthat EDoG can achieve above 0.8 AUC against four state-of-the-art unseen attack\nstrategies without requiring any knowledge about the attack type; and around\n0.85 with knowledge of the attack type. EDoG significantly outperforms\ntraditional malicious edge detection baselines. We also show that an adaptive\nattack with full knowledge of our detection pipeline is difficult to bypass it.",

    "abstract": "Remote sensing of the Earth's surface water is critical in a wide range of\nenvironmental studies, from evaluating the societal impacts of seasonal\ndroughts and floods to the large-scale implications of climate change.\nConsequently, a large literature exists on the classification of water from\nsatellite imagery. Yet, previous methods have been limited by 1) the spatial\nresolution of public satellite imagery, 2) classification schemes that operate\nat the pixel level, and 3) the need for multiple spectral bands. We advance the\nstate-of-the-art by 1) using commercial imagery with panchromatic and\nmultispectral resolutions of 30 cm and 1.2 m, respectively, 2) developing\nmultiple fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) that can learn the\nmorphological features of water bodies in addition to their spectral\nproperties, and 3) FCN that can classify water even from panchromatic imagery.\nThis study focuses on rivers in the Arctic, using images from the Quickbird,\nWorldView, and GeoEye satellites. Because no training data are available at\nsuch high resolutions, we construct those manually. First, we use the RGB, and\nNIR bands of the 8-band multispectral sensors. Those trained models all achieve\nexcellent precision and recall over 90% on validation data, aided by on-the-fly\npreprocessing of the training data specific to satellite imagery. In a novel\napproach, we then use results from the multispectral model to generate training\ndata for FCN that only require panchromatic imagery, of which considerably more\nis available. Despite the smaller feature space, these models still achieve a\nprecision and recall of over 85%. We provide our open-source codes and trained\nmodel parameters to the remote sensing community, which paves the way to a wide\nrange of environmental hydrology applications at vastly superior accuracies and\n2 orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution than previously possible.",

Unlike\npreexisting approaches -- which have tackled the possibility of the receiver\n(Bob) being non-Bayesian by considering that his thought process is not\nBayesian yet known to the sender (Alice), possibly up to a parameter -- we let\nAlice merely assume that Bob behaves `almost like' a Bayesian agent, in some\nsense, without resorting to any specific model. Under this assumption, we study\nAlice's strategy when both utilities are quadratic and the prior is isotropic.\nWe show that, contrary to the Bayesian case, Alice's optimal response may not\nbe linear anymore. This fact is unfortunate as linear policies remain the only\nones for which the induced belief distribution is known. What is more,\nevaluating linear policies proves difficult except in particular cases, let\nalone finding an optimal one. Nonetheless, we derive bounds that prove linear\npolicies are near-optimal and allow Alice to compute a near-optimal linear\npolicy numerically. With this solution in hand, we show that Alice shares less\ninformation with Bob as he departs more from Bayesianity, much to his\ndetriment.",

In this article, we improve\nthe effectiveness to detect outliers in dirty training data with a leave-out\nstrategy: by temporarily omitting one candidate at a time, this point can be\njudged using the remaining data only. We show that this is more effective at\nscoring the outlierness of points than using the slack term of existing\nSVM-based approaches. Identified outliers can then be removed from the data,\nsuch that outliers hidden by other outliers can be identified, to reduce the\nproblem of masking. Naively, this approach would require training N individual\nSVMs (and training $O(N^2)$ SVMs when iteratively removing the worst outliers\none at a time), which is prohibitively expensive. We will discuss that only\nsupport vectors need to be considered in each step and that by reusing SVM\nparameters and weights, this incremental retraining can be accelerated\nsubstantially.

To this end, they evaluate different\ndecision scenarios, often using what-if analyses, which can benefit from\npredictive and prescriptive analytics (PPA). However, incorporating PPA into\ndata analysis systems in a way that is easy to use and understand by business\nusers can be challenging. Numerous studies have examined how data analysts use\nsimple predictive analytics. However, there is little systematic understanding\nand empirical data on business users' analysis practices for decision-making\nand the effectiveness of various PPA affordances in facilitating their\nanalysis. To address this gap, we conduct a study with 22 business users to\nbetter understand their workflows and elicit feedback on the effectiveness of\nfour example PPA functionalities in business data analysis. We find that\nbusiness users can't depend on data analysts for their data analysis due to\nfour reasons: the limited availability of data analysts in enterprises, the\ninefficiency of communicating with data analysts, the business pressure to make\nquick decisions, and the importance of incorporating domain knowledge, which\ndata analysts often lack. We also find that business users rely on interactive\nmanual analysis using spreadsheet-like applications, which makes coping with\nlarge, live, and complex datasets difficult. While business users don't use PPA\ndirectly, their data analysis needs suggest that they can benefit from it.

Spark is a widely used big data processing system that can\nbe integrated with Hadoop to provide powerful abstractions to developers, such\nas distributed storage through HDFS and resource management through YARN. When\nall the required configurations are made, Spark can also provide quality\nattributes, such as scalability, fault tolerance, and security. However, all of\nthese benefits come at the cost of complexity, with high memory requirements,\nand additional latency in processing. An alternative approach is to use a lean\nsoftware stack, like Unicage, that delegates most control back to the\ndeveloper. In this work we evaluated the performance of big data processing\nwith Spark versus Unicage, in a cluster environment hosted in the IBM Cloud.\nTwo sets of experiments were performed: batch processing of unstructured data\nsets, and query processing of structured data sets. The input data sets were of\nsignificant size, ranging from 64 GB to 8192 GB in volume. The results show\nthat the performance of Unicage scripts is superior to Spark for search\nworkloads like grep and select, but that the abstractions of distributed\nstorage and resource management from the Hadoop stack enable Spark to execute\nworkloads with inter-record dependencies, such as sort and join, with correct\noutputs.",

Under a\nglobal emissions constraint, ranging between 80-95\\% emissions reduction\ncompared to 1990 levels, the least-cost solution disproportionately relies on\nusing the available emissions budget to serve non-power NG demand and results\nin the power sector using only 15-43\\% of the emissions budget.",

The\ngold standard Motion capture (MoCap) systems are accurate but inaccessible to\nthe general public due to their cost, hardware and space constraints. In\ncontrast, monocular human mesh recovery (HMR) methods are much more accessible\nthan MoCap as they take single-view videos as inputs. Replacing the multi-view\nMo- Cap systems with a monocular HMR method would break the current barriers to\ncollecting accurate 3D motion thus making exciting applications like motion\nanalysis and motiondriven animation accessible to the general public. However,\nperformance of existing HMR methods degrade when the video contains challenging\nand dynamic motion that is not in existing MoCap datasets used for training.\nThis reduces its appeal as dynamic motion is frequently the target in 3D motion\nrecovery in the aforementioned applications.

In such context, this paper aims to devise an energy\nmanagement strategy for an urban postal-delivery fuel cell electric vehicle for\noperating cost mitigation.

    "abstract": "When facing objects/files of differing sizes in content delivery networks\n(CDNs) caches, pursuing an optimal object miss ratio (OMR) by approximating\nBelady no longer ensures an optimal byte miss ratio (BMR), creating confusion\nabout how to achieve a superior BMR in CDNs. To address this issue, we\nexperimentally observe that there exists a time window to delay the eviction of\nthe object with the longest reuse distance to improve BMR without increasing\nOMR. As a result, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (RL) model to\ncapture this time window by dynamically monitoring the changes in OMR and BMR,\nand implementing a BMR-friendly policy in the time window. Based on this\npolicy, we propose a Belady and Size Eviction (LRU-BaSE) algorithm, reducing\nBMR while maintaining OMR. To make LRU-BaSE efficient and practical, we address\nthe feedback delay problem of RL with a two-pronged approach. On the one hand,\nour observation of a rear section of the LRU cache queue containing most of the\neviction candidates allows LRU-BaSE to shorten the decision region. On the\nother hand, the request distribution on CDNs makes it feasible to divide the\nlearning region into multiple sub-regions that are each learned with reduced\ntime and increased accuracy. In real CDN systems, compared to LRU, LRU-BaSE can\nreduce \"backing to OS\" traffic and access latency by 30.05\\% and 17.07\\%,\nrespectively, on average. The results on the simulator confirm that LRU-BaSE\noutperforms the state-of-the-art cache replacement policies, where LRU-BaSE's\nBMR is 0.63\\% and 0.33\\% less than that of Belady and Practical Flow-based\nOffline Optimal (PFOO), respectively, on average.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has received increasing attention due to its privacy\nprotection capability. However, the base algorithm FedAvg is vulnerable when it\nsuffers from so-called backdoor attacks. Former researchers proposed several\nrobust aggregation methods. Unfortunately, many of these aggregation methods\nare unable to defend against backdoor attacks. What's more, the attackers\nrecently have proposed some hiding methods that further improve backdoor\nattacks' stealthiness, making all the existing robust aggregation methods fail.\nTo tackle the threat of backdoor attacks, we propose a new aggregation\nmethod, X-raying Models with A Matrix (XMAM), to reveal the malicious local\nmodel updates submitted by the backdoor attackers. Since we observe that the\noutput of the Softmax layer exhibits distinguishable patterns between malicious\nand benign updates, we focus on the Softmax layer's output in which the\nbackdoor attackers are difficult to hide their malicious behavior.\nSpecifically, like X-ray examinations, we investigate the local model updates\nby using a matrix as an input to get their Softmax layer's outputs. Then, we\npreclude updates whose outputs are abnormal by clustering. Without any training\ndataset in the server, the extensive evaluations show that our XMAM can\neffectively distinguish malicious local model updates from benign ones. For\ninstance, when other methods fail to defend against the backdoor attacks at no\nmore than 20% malicious clients, our method can tolerate 45% malicious clients\nin the black-box mode and about 30% in Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) mode.\nBesides, under adaptive attacks, the results demonstrate that XMAM can still\ncomplete the global model training task even when there are 40% malicious\nclients. Finally, we analyze our method's screening complexity, and the results\nshow that XMAM is about 10-10000 times faster than the existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Fine-grained visual parsing, including fine-grained part segmentation and\nfine-grained object recognition, has attracted considerable critical attention\ndue to its importance in many real-world applications, e.g., agriculture,\nremote sensing, and space technologies. Predominant research efforts tackle\nthese fine-grained sub-tasks following different paradigms, while the inherent\nrelations between these tasks are neglected. Moreover, given most of the\nresearch remains fragmented, we conduct an in-depth study of the advanced work\nfrom a new perspective of learning the part relationship. In this perspective,\nwe first consolidate recent research and benchmark syntheses with new\ntaxonomies. Based on this consolidation, we revisit the universal challenges in\nfine-grained part segmentation and recognition tasks and propose new solutions\nby part relationship learning for these important challenges. Furthermore, we\nconclude several promising lines of research in fine-grained visual parsing for\nfuture research.",

    "abstract": "Fine-grained classification and counting of bone marrow erythroid cells are\nvital for evaluating the health status and formulating therapeutic schedules\nfor leukemia or hematopathy. Due to the subtle visual differences between\ndifferent types of erythroid cells, it is challenging to apply existing\nimage-based deep learning models for fine-grained erythroid cell\nclassification. Moreover, there is no large open-source datasets on erythroid\ncells to support the model training. In this paper, we introduce BMEC (Bone\nMorrow Erythroid Cells), the first large fine-grained image dataset of\nerythroid cells, to facilitate more deep learning research on erythroid cells.\nBMEC contains 5,666 images of individual erythroid cells, each of which is\nextracted from the bone marrow erythroid cell smears and professionally\nannotated to one of the four types of erythroid cells. To distinguish the\nerythroid cells, one key indicator is the cell shape which is closely related\nto the cell growth and maturation. Therefore, we design a novel shape-aware\nimage classification network for fine-grained erythroid cell classification.\nThe shape feature is extracted from the shape mask image and aggregated to the\nraw image feature with a shape attention module. With the shape-attended image\nfeature, our network achieved superior classification performance (81.12\\%\ntop-1 accuracy) on the BMEC dataset comparing to the baseline methods. Ablation\nstudies also demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating the shape\ninformation for the fine-grained cell classification. To further verify the\ngeneralizability of our method, we tested our network on two additional public\nwhite blood cells (WBC) datasets and the results show our shape-aware method\ncan generally outperform recent state-of-the-art works on classifying the WBC.\nThe code and BMEC dataset can be found on https://github.com/wangye8899/BMEC.",

    "abstract": "Recent increases in the computational demands of deep neural networks (DNNs)\nhave sparked interest in efficient deep learning mechanisms, e.g., quantization\nor pruning. These mechanisms enable the construction of a small, efficient\nversion of commercial-scale models with comparable accuracy, accelerating their\ndeployment to resource-constrained devices.\nIn this paper, we study the security considerations of publishing on-device\nvariants of large-scale models. We first show that an adversary can exploit\non-device models to make attacking the large models easier. In evaluations\nacross 19 DNNs, by exploiting the published on-device models as a transfer\nprior, the adversarial vulnerability of the original commercial-scale models\nincreases by up to 100x. We then show that the vulnerability increases as the\nsimilarity between a full-scale and its efficient model increase. Based on the\ninsights, we propose a defense, $similarity$-$unpairing$, that fine-tunes\non-device models with the objective of reducing the similarity. We evaluated\nour defense on all the 19 DNNs and found that it reduces the transferability up\nto 90% and the number of queries required by a factor of 10-100x. Our results\nsuggest that further research is needed on the security (or even privacy)\nthreats caused by publishing those efficient siblings.",

Existing GNNs have mostly focused on learning a single node\nrepresentation, despite that a node often exhibits polysemous behavior in\ndifferent contexts. In this work, we develop a persona-based graph neural\nnetwork framework called PersonaSAGE that learns multiple persona-based\nembeddings for each node in the graph.

Furthermore, PersonaSAGE\nlearns the appropriate set of persona embeddings for each node in the graph,\nand every node can have a different number of assigned persona embeddings. The\nframework is flexible enough and the general design helps in the wide\napplicability of the learned embeddings to suit the domain. We utilize publicly\navailable benchmark datasets to evaluate our approach and against a variety of\nbaselines. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PersonaSAGE for a\nvariety of important tasks including link prediction where we achieve an\naverage gain of 15% while remaining competitive for node classification.\nFinally, we also demonstrate the utility of PersonaSAGE with a case study for\npersonalized recommendation of different entity types in a data management\nplatform.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have brought a lot of advancements in\nsequence labeling tasks and sequence data. However, their effectiveness is\nlimited when the observations in the sequence are irregularly sampled, where\nthe observations arrive at irregular time intervals. To address this,\ncontinuous time variants of the RNNs were introduced based on neural ordinary\ndifferential equations (NODE). They learn a better representation of the data\nusing the continuous transformation of hidden states over time, taking into\naccount the time interval between the observations. However, they are still\nlimited in their capability as they use the discrete transformations and a\nfixed discrete number of layers (depth) over an input in the sequence to\nproduce the output observation. We intend to address this limitation by\nproposing RNNs based on differential equations which model continuous\ntransformations over both depth and time to predict an output for a given input\nin the sequence. Specifically, we propose continuous depth recurrent neural\ndifferential equations (CDR-NDE) which generalizes RNN models by continuously\nevolving the hidden states in both the temporal and depth dimensions. CDR-NDE\nconsiders two separate differential equations over each of these dimensions and\nmodels the evolution in the temporal and depth directions alternatively. We\nalso propose the CDR-NDE-heat model based on partial differential equations\nwhich treats the computation of hidden states as solving a heat equation over\ntime.

To this end, we utilize a deep\nfusion network to fuse view-specific representations into the view-common\nrepresentation, extracting high-level semantics for obtaining robust\nrepresentation. In addition, we employ a clustering task to guide the fusion\nnetwork to prevent it from leading to trivial solutions. For balancing\nconsistency and complementary, then, we design an asymmetrical contrastive\nstrategy that aligns the view-common representation and each view-specific\nrepresentation. These modules are incorporated into a unified method known as\nCLustering-guided cOntrastiVE fusioN (CLOVEN). We quantitatively and\nqualitatively evaluate the proposed method on five datasets, demonstrating that\nCLOVEN outperforms 11 competitive multi-view learning methods in clustering and\nclassification. In the incomplete view scenario, our proposed method resists\nnoise interference better than those of our competitors. Furthermore, the\nvisualization analysis shows that CLOVEN can preserve the intrinsic structure\nof view-specific representation while also improving the compactness of\nview-commom representation.

    "title": "Redirected Walking in Infinite Virtual Indoor Environment Using  Change-blindness",
    "abstract": "We present a change-blindness based redirected walking algorithm that allows\na user to explore on foot a virtual indoor environment consisting of an\ninfinite number of rooms while at the same time ensuring collision-free walking\nfor the user in real space. This method uses change blindness to scale and\ntranslate the room without the user's awareness by moving the wall while the\nuser is not looking. Consequently, the virtual room containing the current user\nalways exists in the valid real space. We measured the detection threshold for\nwhether the user recognizes the movement of the wall outside the field of view.\nThen, we used the measured detection threshold to determine the amount of\nchanging the dimension of the room by moving that wall. We conducted a\nlive-user experiment to navigate the same virtual environment using the\nproposed method and other existing methods. As a result, users reported higher\nusability, presence, and immersion when using the proposed method while showing\nreduced motion sickness compared to other methods. Hence, our approach can be\nused to implement applications to allow users to explore an infinitely large\nvirtual indoor environment such as virtual museum and virtual model house while\nsimultaneously walking in a small real space, giving users a more realistic\nexperience.",

    "title": "TempCLR: Temporal Alignment Representation with Contrastive Learning",
    "abstract": "Video representation learning has been successful in video-text pre-training\nfor zero-shot transfer, where each sentence is trained to be close to the\npaired video clips in a common feature space. For long videos, given a\nparagraph of description where the sentences describe different segments of the\nvideo, by matching all sentence-clip pairs, the paragraph and the full video\nare aligned implicitly. However, such unit-level similarity measure may ignore\nthe global temporal context over a long time span, which inevitably limits the\ngeneralization ability. In this paper, we propose a contrastive learning\nframework TempCLR to compare the full video and the paragraph explicitly. As\nthe video/paragraph is formulated as a sequence of clips/sentences, under the\nconstraint of their temporal order, we use dynamic time warping to compute the\nminimum cumulative cost over sentence-clip pairs as the sequence-level\ndistance. To explore the temporal dynamics, we break the consistency of\ntemporal order by shuffling the video clips or sentences according to the\ntemporal granularity. In this way, we obtain the representations for\nclips/sentences, which perceive the temporal information and thus facilitate\nthe sequence alignment. In addition to pre-training on the video and paragraph,\nour approach can also generalize on the matching between different video\ninstances. We evaluate our approach on video retrieval, action step\nlocalization, and few-shot action recognition, and achieve consistent\nperformance gain over all three tasks. Detailed ablation studies are provided\nto justify the approach design.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, digital technologies have grown in many ways. As a result,\nmany school-aged children have been exposed to the digital world a lot.\nChildren are using more digital technologies, so schools need to teach kids\nmore about cyber security and online safety.

Still, despite\nmany programmes and projects, there is not much proof of how many schools have\ntaken part and helped spread the word about them. This work shows how we can\nlearn about the size and scope of cyber security and online safety education in\nschools in the UK, a country with a very active and advanced cyber security\neducation profile, using nearly 200k public tweets from over 15k schools. By\nusing simple techniques like descriptive statistics and visualisation as well\nas advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques like sentiment\nanalysis and topic modelling, we show some new findings and insights about how\nUK schools as a sector have been doing on Twitter with their cyber security and\nonline safety education activities.

    "abstract": "Allowing for space- and time-dependence of mass in Klein--Gordon equations\nresolves the problem of negative probability density and violation of Lorenz\ncovariance of interaction in quantum mechanics. Moreover, it extends their\napplicability to the domain of quantum cosmology, where the variation in mass\nmay be accompanied by high oscillations. In this paper, we propose a\nthird-order exponential integrator, where the main idea lies in embedding the\noscillations triggered by the possibly highly oscillatory component\nintrinsically into the numerical discretisation. While typically high\noscillation requires appropriately small time steps, an application of Filon\nmethods allows implementation with large time steps even in the presence of\nvery high oscillation. This greatly improves the efficiency of the\ntime-stepping algorithm.\nProof of the convergence and its rate are nontrivial and require alternative\nrepresentation of the equation under consideration. We derive careful bounds on\nthe growth of global error in time discretisation and prove that, contrary to\nstandard intuition, the error of time integration does not grow once the\nfrequency of oscillations increases. Several of numerical simulations are\npresented to confirm the theoretical investigations and the robustness of the\nmethod in all oscillatory regimes.",

Such a framework would heighten our understanding of the endeavor\nand provide a way to formally analyze techniques and approaches. To this end,\nwe first propose a Bayesian framework of understanding automated repair and\nfind that in conjunction with a concrete statement of the objective of\nautomated debugging, we can recover maximal fault localization formulae from\nprior work, as well as analyze existing APR techniques and their underlying\nassumptions.\nAs a means of empirically demonstrating our framework, we further propose\nBAPP, a Bayesian Patch Prioritization technique that incorporates intermediate\nprogram values to analyze likely patch locations and repair actions, with its\ncore equations being derived by our Bayesian framework. We find that\nincorporating program values allows BAPP to identify correct patches more\nprecisely: when applied to the patches generated by kPAR, the rankings produced\nby BAPP reduce the number of required patch validation by 68% and consequently\nreduce the repair time by 34 minutes on average. Further, BAPP improves the\nprecision of FL, increasing acc@5 on the studied bugs from 8 to 11.

Several\ntechniques based on re-weighting and margin adjustment of loss are often used\nto enhance the performance of neural networks, particularly on minority\nclasses. In this work, we analyze the class-imbalanced learning problem by\nexamining the loss landscape of neural networks trained with re-weighting and\nmargin-based techniques. Specifically, we examine the spectral density of\nHessian of class-wise loss, through which we observe that the network weights\nconverge to a saddle point in the loss landscapes of minority classes.\nFollowing this observation, we also find that optimization methods designed to\nescape from saddle points can be effectively used to improve generalization on\nminority classes. We further theoretically and empirically demonstrate that\nSharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), a recent technique that encourages\nconvergence to a flat minima, can be effectively used to escape saddle points\nfor minority classes. Using SAM results in a 6.2\\% increase in accuracy on the\nminority classes over the state-of-the-art Vector Scaling Loss, leading to an\noverall average increase of 4\\% across imbalanced datasets.

The quantized methods have reduced action space and\ntherefore faster convergence; with sufficient training, the UL and DL rates for\nthe quantized phase method are $8.14\\%$ and $2.45\\%$ better than the continuous\nphase method respectively.

We manually build an annotated\ncorpus with six different types of FWS. Then, automatic recognition and\nclassification of FWS are implemented using machine learning models, and the\nperformance of these models is compared based on the evaluation metrics. The\nresults show that the Bernoulli Bayesian model has the best performance in the\nautomatic recognition task, with the Macro F1 reaching 90.73%, and the SCIBERT\nmodel has the best performance in the automatic classification task, with the\nweighted average F1 reaching 72.63%. Finally, we extract keywords from FWS and\ngain a deep understanding of the key content described in FWS, and we also\ndemonstrate that content determination in FWS will be reflected in the\nsubsequent research work by measuring the similarity between future work\nsentences and the abstracts.",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) concerns pursuing an optimal policy for\nsequential decision-making from a pre-collected dataset, without further\ninteraction with the environment. Recent theoretical progress has focused on\ndeveloping sample-efficient offline RL algorithms with various relaxed\nassumptions on data coverage and function approximators, especially to handle\nthe case with excessively large state-action spaces. Among them, the framework\nbased on the linear-programming (LP) reformulation of Markov decision processes\nhas shown promise: it enables sample-efficient offline RL with function\napproximation, under only partial data coverage and realizability assumptions\non the function classes, with favorable computational tractability. In this\nwork, we revisit the LP framework for offline RL, and advance the existing\nresults in several aspects, relaxing certain assumptions and achieving optimal\nstatistical rates in terms of sample size. Our key enabler is to introduce\nproper constraints in the reformulation, instead of using any regularization as\nin the literature, sometimes also with careful choices of the function classes\nand initial state distributions. We hope our insights further advocate the\nstudy of the LP framework, as well as the induced primal-dual minimax\noptimization, in offline RL.",

The COVID-19 pandemic had a major outbreak in January 2020 and was\nfollowed by different preventive measures, lockdown, and finally by the process\nof vaccination. To date, more comprehensive analysis of news related to\nCOVID-19 pandemic are missing, especially those which explain what aspects of\nthis pandemic are being reported by newspapers inserted in different economies\nand belonging to different political alignments. Since LDA is often less\ncoherent when there are news articles published across the world about an event\nand you look answers for specific queries. It is because of having semantically\ndifferent content. To address this challenge, we performed pooling of news\narticles based on information retrieval using TF-IDF score in a data processing\nstep and topic modeling using LDA with combination of 1 to 6 ngrams. We used\nVADER sentiment analyzer to analyze the differences in sentiments in news\narticles reported across different geographical places. The novelty of this\nstudy is to look at how COVID-19 pandemic was reported by the media, providing\na comparison among countries in different political and economic contexts.

The\nbest-performing xView2 networks' performances dropped noticeably in our new\nlimited/local damage detection task. The common causes of failure observed are\nthat (1) building objects and their classifications are not separated well, and\n(2) when they are, the classification is strongly biased by surrounding\nbuildings and other damage context. Thus, we release our augmented version of\nthe dataset with additional object-level scoring metrics\nhttps://gitlab.kitware.com/dennis.melamed/xfbd to test independence and\nseparability of building objects, alongside the pixel-level performance metrics\nof the original competition.

A major challenge in using traditional\nrating dependent recommendation systems, like collaborative filtering and\ncontent based systems, in high volume social networks is that, due to attention\nscarcity most items do not get any ratings. Additionally, the fact that most\nTwitter users are passive consumers, with 44% users never tweeting, makes it\nvery difficult to use user ratings for generating recommendations. Further, a\nkey challenge in developing recommendation systems is that in many cases users\nreject relevant recommendations if they are totally unfamiliar with the\nrecommended item. Providing a suitable explanation, for why the item is\nrecommended, significantly improves the acceptability of recommendation. By\nvirtue of being a topical recommendation system our method is able to present\nsimple topical explanations for the generated recommendations.

Finally,\nnumerical simulations demonstrate a mean squared error over 8.7 times lower\ncompared to multiple shooting when data are noisy and/or sparse. Moreover, the\nproposed approach can identify accurate and generalizable models even when\nthere are more parameters than data or when the underlying system exhibits\nchaotic behavior.",

    "title": "A Novel Self-Supervised Learning-Based Anomaly Node Detection Method  Based on an Autoencoder in Wireless Sensor Networks",
    "abstract": "Due to the issue that existing wireless sensor network (WSN)-based anomaly\ndetection methods only consider and analyze temporal features, in this paper, a\nself-supervised learning-based anomaly node detection method based on an\nautoencoder is designed. This method integrates temporal WSN data flow feature\nextraction, spatial position feature extraction and intermodal WSN correlation\nfeature extraction into the design of the autoencoder to make full use of the\nspatial and temporal information of the WSN for anomaly detection. First, a\nfully connected network is used to extract the temporal features of nodes by\nconsidering a single mode from a local spatial perspective. Second, a graph\nneural network (GNN) is used to introduce the WSN topology from a global\nspatial perspective for anomaly detection and extract the spatial and temporal\nfeatures of the data flows of nodes and their neighbors by considering a single\nmode. Then, the adaptive fusion method involving weighted summation is used to\nextract the relevant features between different models. In addition, this paper\nintroduces a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to solve the long-term dependence\nproblem of the time dimension. Eventually, the reconstructed output of the\ndecoder and the hidden layer representation of the autoencoder are fed into a\nfully connected network to calculate the anomaly probability of the current\nsystem. Since the spatial feature extraction operation is advanced, the\ndesigned method can be applied to the task of large-scale network anomaly\ndetection by adding a clustering operation. Experiments show that the designed\nmethod outperforms the baselines, and the F1 score reaches 90.6%, which is 5.2%\nhigher than those of the existing anomaly detection methods based on\nunsupervised reconstruction and prediction.

Existing\nmethods extract part features in an explicit manner, by either using a\nhand-designed image division or keypoints obtained with external visual\nsystems. In this work, we propose to learn Discriminative implicit Parts (DiPs)\nwhich are decoupled from explicit body parts. Therefore, DiPs can learn to\nextract any discriminative features that can benefit in distinguishing\nidentities, which is beyond predefined body parts (such as accessories).\nMoreover, we propose a novel implicit position to give a geometric\ninterpretation for each DiP. The implicit position can also serve as a learning\nsignal to encourage DiPs to be more position-equivariant with the identity in\nthe image. Lastly, a set of attributes and auxiliary losses are introduced to\nfurther improve the learning of DiPs.

    "abstract": "Ranking intuitionistic fuzzy sets with distance based ranking methods\nrequires to calculate the distance between intuitionistic fuzzy set and a\nreference point which is known to have either maximum (positive ideal solution)\nor minimum (negative ideal solution) value. These group of approaches assume\nthat as the distance of an intuitionistic fuzzy set to the reference point is\ndecreases, the similarity of intuitionistic fuzzy set with that point\nincreases. This is a misconception because an intuitionistic fuzzy set which\nhas the shortest distance to positive ideal solution does not have to be the\nfurthest from negative ideal solution for all circumstances when the distance\nfunction is nonlinear. This paper gives a mathematical proof of why this\nassumption is not valid for any of the non-linear distance functions and\nsuggests a hypervolume based ranking approach as an alternative to distance\nbased ranking. In addition, the suggested ranking approach is extended as a new\nmulticriteria decision making method, HyperVolume based ASsessment (HVAS).

    "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to introduce a new theoretical framework for\nOptimal Transport (OT), using the terminology and techniques of Fully\nProbabilistic Design (FPD). Optimal Transport is the canonical method for\ncomparing probability measures and has been successfully applied in a wide\nrange of areas (computer vision Rubner et al. [2004], computer graphics Solomon\net al. [2015], natural language processing Kusner et al. [2015], etc.).\nHowever, we argue that the current OT framework suffers from two shortcomings:\nfirst, it is hard to induce generic constraints and probabilistic knowledge in\nthe OT problem; second, the current formalism does not address the question of\nuncertainty in the marginals, lacking therefore the mechanisms to design robust\nsolutions. By viewing the OT problem as the optimal design of a probability\ndensity function with marginal constraints, we prove that OT is an instance of\nthe more generic FPD framework. In this new setting, we can furnish the OT\nframework with the necessary mechanisms for processing probabilistic\nconstraints and deriving uncertainty quantifiers, hence establishing a new\nextended framework, called FPD-OT. Our main contribution in this paper is to\nestablish the connection between OT and FPD, providing new theoretical insights\nfor both. This will lay the foundations for the application of FPD-OT in a\nsubsequent work, notably in processing more sophisticated knowledge\nconstraints, as well as in designing robust solutions in the case of uncertain\nmarginals.",

The\nfluctuation of inference quality seriously affects its practical applications,\nand the quality at the tail may lead to severe consequences.

On the one hand, the\nneural network models must be deployed on complex systems with limited\nresources. On the other hand, safety-critical and mission-critical tasks need\nto meet more metric constraints while ensuring high inference quality.\nWe coin a new term, ``tail quality,'' to characterize this essential\nrequirement and challenge. We also propose a new metric,\n``X-Critical-Quality,'' to measure the inference quality under certain\nconstraints.

To improve the secrecy performance, two\nsub-optimal and optimal transmitter selection schemes are proposed. A\ngeneralized approach for the secrecy performance analysis is adopted to\nintegrate the backhaul link reliability factor with the channel signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) through a mixture distribution depending on whether the backhaul\nreliability knowledge is unavailable or available. Non-zero secrecy rate\n(NZSR), secrecy outage probability (SOP), and ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) are\nevaluated for each selection schemes via a unified channel SNR ratio\ndistribution based approach. Simplified asymptotic expressions are provided in\neach case to elucidate the infulence of the system parameters and of the\nbackhaul reliability factor. We observe that the unreliable backhaul limits the\nsecrecy performance of transmitter selection schemes by saturating the NZSR and\nSOP performance and by reducing the rate of change of the ESR with SNR. The\nperformance improves when the knowledge of backhaul link activity is utilized,\nand the improvement is most noticeable when the backhaul is highly unreliable.\nWe also observe that while the secrecy performance degrades with an increasing\nnumber of eavesdroppers, neither the asymptotic saturation value of the NZSR\nand SOP nor the rate of ESR improvement with SNR depends on the number of\neavesdroppers.",

    "abstract": "The C and C++ programming languages are widely used for the implementation of\nsoftware in critical systems. They are complex languages with subtle features\nand peculiarities that might baffle even the more expert programmers. Hence,\nthe general prescription of language subsetting, which occurs in most\nfunctional safety standards and amounts to only using a \"safer\" subset of the\nlanguage, is particularly applicable to them. Coding guidelines are the\npreferred way of expressing language subsets. Some guidelines are formulated in\nterms of the programming language and its implementation only: in this case\nthey are amenable to automatic checking. However, due to fundamental\nlimitations of computing, some guidelines are undecidable, that is, they are\nbased on program properties that no current and future algorithm can capture in\nall cases. The most mature and widespread coding standards, the MISRA ones,\nexplicitly tag guidelines with undecidable or decidable. It turns out that this\ninformation is not of secondary nature and must be taken into account for a\nfull understanding of what the guideline is asking for. As a matter of fact,\nundecidability is a common source of confusion affecting many users of coding\nstandards and of the associated checking tools. In this paper, we recall the\nnotions of decidability and undecidability in terms that are understandable to\nany C/C++ programmer. The paper includes a systematic study of all the\nundecidable MISRA C:2012 guidelines, discussing the reasons for the\nundecidability and its consequences. We pay particular attention to undecidable\nguidelines that have decidable approximations whose enforcement would not\noverly constrain the source code.

    "title": "Towards Disentangling Relevance and Bias in Unbiased Learning to Rank",
    "abstract": "Unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) studies the problem of mitigating various\nbiases from implicit user feedback data such as clicks, and has been receiving\nconsiderable attention recently. A popular ULTR approach for real-world\napplications uses a two-tower architecture, where click modeling is factorized\ninto a relevance tower with regular input features, and a bias tower with\nbias-relevant inputs such as the position of a document. A successful\nfactorization will allow the relevance tower to be exempt from biases. In this\nwork, we identify a critical issue that existing ULTR methods ignored - the\nbias tower can be confounded with the relevance tower via the underlying true\nrelevance. In particular, the positions were determined by the logging policy,\ni.e., the previous production model, which would possess relevance information.\nWe give both theoretical analysis and empirical results to show the negative\neffects on relevance tower due to such a correlation. We then propose three\nmethods to mitigate the negative confounding effects by better disentangling\nrelevance and bias. Empirical results on both controlled public datasets and a\nlarge-scale industry dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",

    "abstract": "Learning models are highly dependent on data to work effectively, and they\ngive a better performance upon training on big datasets. Massive research\nexists in the literature to address the dataset adequacy issue. One promising\napproach for solving dataset adequacy issues is the data augmentation (DA)\napproach. In DA, the amount of training data instances is increased by making\ndifferent transformations on the available data instances to generate new\ncorrect and representative data instances. DA increases the dataset size and\nits variability, which enhances the model performance and its prediction\naccuracy. DA also solves the class imbalance problem in the classification\nlearning techniques. Few studies have recently considered DA in the Arabic\nlanguage. These studies rely on traditional augmentation approaches, such as\nparaphrasing by using rules or noising-based techniques. In this paper, we\npropose a new Arabic DA method that employs the recent powerful modeling\ntechnique, namely the AraGPT-2, for the augmentation process. The generated\nsentences are evaluated in terms of context, semantics, diversity, and novelty\nusing the Euclidean, cosine, Jaccard, and BLEU distances. Finally, the AraBERT\ntransformer is used on sentiment classification tasks to evaluate the\nclassification performance of the augmented Arabic dataset. The experiments\nwere conducted on four sentiment Arabic datasets, namely AraSarcasm, ASTD, ATT,\nand MOVIE. The selected datasets vary in size, label number, and unbalanced\nclasses. The results show that the proposed methodology enhanced the Arabic\nsentiment text classification on all datasets with an increase in F1 score by\n4% in AraSarcasm, 6% in ASTD, 9% in ATT, and 13% in MOVIE.",

This\nwork develops HeAT (Heated Alert Triage): given a critical indicator of\ncompromise (IoC), e.g., a severe IDS alert, HeAT produces a HeATed Attack\nCampaign (HAC) depicting the multistage activities that led up to the critical\nevent. We define the concept of \"Alert Episode Heat\" to represent the analysts\nopinion of how much an event contributes to the attack campaign of the critical\nIoC given their knowledge of the network and security expertise. Leveraging a\nnetwork-agnostic feature set, HeAT learns the essence of analyst's assessment\nof \"HeAT\" for a small set of IoC's, and applies the learned model to extract\ninsightful attack campaigns for IoC's not seen before, even across networks by\ntransferring what have been learned. We demonstrate the capabilities of HeAT\nwith data collected in Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC) and\nthrough collaboration with a real-world SOC. We developed HeAT-Gain metrics to\ndemonstrate how analysts may assess and benefit from the extracted attack\ncampaigns in comparison to common practices where IP addresses are used to\ncorroborate evidences. Our results demonstrates the practical uses of HeAT by\nfinding campaigns that span across diverse attack stages, remove a significant\nvolume of irrelevant alerts, and achieve coherency to the analyst's original\nassessments.",

Their identification is one of the\nmost complex steps, and therefore of great interest for the study of robust\nmethods that do not necessarily rely on a machine learning (ML) approach.\nMethod: A fully automatic and optimized segmentation process for different\ndatasets is a prerequisite for classifying and diagnosing Indirect\nImmunoFluorescence (IIF) raw data. This study describes a deterministic\ncomputational neuroscience approach for identifying cells and nuclei. It is far\nfrom the conventional neural network approach, but it is equivalent to their\nquantitative and qualitative performance, and it is also solid to adversative\nnoise. The method is robust, based on formally correct functions, and does not\nsuffer from tuning on specific data sets. Results: This work demonstrates the\nrobustness of the method against the variability of parameters, such as image\nsize, mode, and signal-to-noise ratio. We validated the method on two datasets\n(Neuroblastoma and NucleusSegData) using images annotated by independent\nmedical doctors. Conclusions: The definition of deterministic and formally\ncorrect methods, from a functional to a structural point of view, guarantees\nthe achievement of optimized and functionally correct results. The excellent\nperformance of our deterministic method (NeuronalAlg) to segment cells and\nnuclei from fluorescence images was measured with quantitative indicators and\ncompared with those achieved by three published ML approaches.",

This immense growth\nstemmed partially from the stress of the pandemic but also from increased\nexposure to content that promotes eating disorders via social media, which,\nwithin the last decade, has become plagued by pro-eating disorder content. This\nstudy aimed to create a deep learning model capable of determining whether a\ngiven social media post promotes eating disorders based solely on image data.\nTweets from hashtags that have been documented to promote eating disorders\nalong with tweets from unrelated hashtags were collected. After prepossessing,\nthese images were labeled as either pro-eating disorder or not based on which\nTwitter hashtag they were scraped from. Several deep-learning models were\ntrained on the scraped dataset and were evaluated based on their accuracy, F1\nscore, precision, and recall. Ultimately, the vision transformer model was\ndetermined to be the most accurate, attaining an F1 score of 0.877 and an\naccuracy of 86.7% on the test set. The model, which was applied to unlabeled\nTwitter image data scraped from \"#selfie\", uncovered seasonal fluctuations in\nthe relative abundance of pro-eating disorder content, which reached its peak\nin the summertime. These fluctuations correspond not only to the seasons, but\nalso to stressors, such as the Covid-19 pandemic.

    "abstract": "Existing works on cell-free systems consider either coherent or non-coherent\ndownlink data transmission and a network deployment with a single central\nprocessing unit (CPU). While it is known that coherent transmission outperforms\nnoncoherent transmission when assuming unlimited fronthaul links, the former\nrequires a perfect timing synchronization, which is practically not viable over\na large network. Furthermore, relying on a single CPU for geographically large\ncell-free networks is not scalable. Thus, to realize the expected gains of\ncellfree systems in practice, alternative transmission strategies for realistic\nmulti-CPU cell-free systems are required. Therefore, this paper proposes a\nnovel downlink data transmission scheme that combines and generalizes the\nexisting coherent and non-coherent transmissions. The proposed transmission\nscheme, named mixed transmission, works based on the realistic assumption that\nonly the access points (APs) controlled by a same CPU are synchronized, and\nthus transmit in a coherent fashion, while APs from different CPUs require no\nsynchronism and transmit in a non-coherent manner. We also propose extensions\nof existing clustering algorithms for multi-CPU cell-free systems with mixed\ntransmission. Simulation results show that the combination of the proposed\nclustering algorithms with mixed transmission have the potential to perform\nclose to the ideal coherent transmission.",

An edge subset $M$ is an induced matching in $G$ if $M$ is a\nmatching such that there is no edge between two distinct edges of $M$. Our work\nlooks into the parameterized complexity of Induced Matching with respect to\n\"below guarantee\" parameterizations. We consider the parameterization $u -\n\\ell$ for an upper bound $u$ on the size of any induced matching. For instance,\nany induced matching is of size at most $n / 2$ where $n$ is the number of\nvertices, which gives us a parameter $n / 2 - \\ell$. In fact, there is a\nstraightforward $9^{n/2 - \\ell} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm for Induced\nMatching [Moser and Thilikos, J. Discrete Algorithms]. Motivated by this, we\nask: Is Induced Matching FPT for a parameter smaller than $n / 2 - \\ell$? In\nsearch for such parameters, we consider $MM(G) - \\ell$ and $IS(G) - \\ell$,\nwhere $MM(G)$ is the maximum matching size and $IS(G)$ is the maximum\nindependent set size of $G$. We find that Induced Matching is presumably not\nFPT when parameterized by $MM(G) - \\ell$ or $IS(G) - \\ell$. In contrast to\nthese intractability results, we find that taking the average of the two helps\n-- our main result is a branching algorithm that solves Induced Matching in\n$49^{(MM(G) + IS(G))/ 2 - \\ell} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time.

In this paper, we\npropose the learning scheme of Target Inner-Geometry from the LiDAR modality\ninto camera-based BEV detectors for both dense depth and BEV features, termed\nas TiG-BEV. First, we introduce an inner-depth supervision module to learn the\nlow-level relative depth relations between different foreground pixels.

We\nbelieve that an alternative approach, where visitors to websites donate some of\ntheir CPU time whilst they are browsing, has the potential to address these\nissues. However, web-based distributed computing is an immature field and there\nare numerous questions that must be answered to fully understand the viability\nof leveraging the large scale parallelism that website visitors represent. In\nthis paper we describe our web-based distributed computing framework, Panther,\nand perform in-depth performance experiments for two benchmarks using real\nworld hardware and real world browsing habits for the first time. By exploring\nthe performance characteristics of our approach we demonstrate that this is\nviable for urgent workloads, but there are numerous caveats, not least the most\nappropriate visitor patterns to a website, that must be considered.",

C-V2X utilizes direct\ncommunication mode for safety packet broadcasts (through the usage of periodic\nbasic safety messages) while leaving sufficient room in the resource pool for\nadvanced service applications. While many such ITS applications are under\ndevelopment, it is crucial to identify and optimize the relevant network\nparameters.

To achieve the service utility of a transaction class, two\nC-V2X entities require a successive exchange of multiple messages. With this\nnotion, our proposed application prototype can be generalized for any vehicular\nservice to establish connections on-the-fly.

    "abstract": "A key feature of federated learning (FL) is to preserve the data privacy of\nend users. However, there still exist potential privacy leakage in exchanging\ngradients under FL. As a result, recent research often explores the\ndifferential privacy (DP) approaches to add noises to the computing results to\naddress privacy concerns with low overheads, which however degrade the model\nperformance. In this paper, we strike the balance of data privacy and\nefficiency by utilizing the pervasive social connections between users.\nSpecifically, we propose SCFL, a novel Social-aware Clustered Federated\nLearning scheme, where mutually trusted individuals can freely form a social\ncluster and aggregate their raw model updates (e.g., gradients) inside each\ncluster before uploading to the cloud for global aggregation. By mixing model\nupdates in a social group, adversaries can only eavesdrop the social-layer\ncombined results, but not the privacy of individuals. We unfold the design of\nSCFL in three steps. \\emph{i) Stable social cluster formation. Considering\nusers' heterogeneous training samples and data distributions, we formulate the\noptimal social cluster formation problem as a federation game and devise a fair\nrevenue allocation mechanism to resist free-riders. ii) Differentiated\ntrust-privacy mapping}. For the clusters with low mutual trust, we design a\ncustomizable privacy preservation mechanism to adaptively sanitize\nparticipants' model updates depending on social trust degrees. iii) Distributed\nconvergence}.

They\nhave begun to advise employers on which job applicants to interview, judges on\nwhich defendants to grant bail, lenders on which homeowners to give loans, and\nmore. In such settings, different data-driven rules result in different\ndecisions. The problem is: to every data-driven rule, there are exceptions.\nWhile a data-driven rule may be appropriate for some, it may not be appropriate\nfor all. As data-driven decisions become more common, there are cases in which\nit becomes necessary to protect the individuals who, through no fault of their\nown, are the data-driven exceptions. At the same time, it is impossible to\nscrutinize every one of the increasing number of data-driven decisions, begging\nthe question: When and how should data-driven exceptions be protected?\nIn this piece, we argue that individuals have the right to be an exception to\na data-driven rule. That is, the presumption should not be that a data-driven\nrule--even one with high accuracy--is suitable for an arbitrary\ndecision-subject of interest. Rather, a decision-maker should apply the rule\nonly if they have exercised due care and due diligence (relative to the risk of\nharm) in excluding the possibility that the decision-subject is an exception to\nthe data-driven rule. In some cases, the risk of harm may be so low that only\ncursory consideration is required. Although applying due care and due diligence\nis meaningful in human-driven decision contexts, it is unclear what it means\nfor a data-driven rule to do so. We propose that determining whether a\ndata-driven rule is suitable for a given decision-subject requires the\nconsideration of three factors: individualization, uncertainty, and harm.

To\novercome this challenge, over-the-air computing (AirComp) is a promising medium\naccess technology, which exploits the superposition property of the wireless\nmultiple access channel (MAC) and offers significant bandwidth savings. In this\nwork, we propose an AirComp framework for general distributed convex\noptimization problems.

Under general assumptions,\nwe prove that DPDAirComp can asymptotically achieve zero expected constraint\nviolation. Therefore, DPD-AirComp ensures the feasibility of the original\nproblem, despite the presence of channel fading and additive noise. Moreover,\nwith proper power control of the users' signals, the expected non-zero\noptimality gap can also be mitigated. Two practical applications of the\nproposed framework are presented, namely, smart grid management and wireless\nresource allocation. Finally, numerical results reconfirm DPDAirComp's\nexcellent performance, while it is also shown that DPD-AirComp converges an\norder of magnitude faster compared to a digital orthogonal multiple access\nscheme, specifically, time division multiple access (TDMA).",

This leads to faster training and\ncan avoid well-known pathologies of gradient descent optimization of multi-part\nPINN loss functions. If the characteristic ODEs can be solved exactly, which is\ntrue in important cases, the output of a CINN is an exact solution of the PDE,\neven at initialization, preventing the occurrence of non-physical outputs.\nOtherwise, the ODEs must be solved approximately, but the CINN is still trained\nonly using a data-fitting loss function.

DSP can express high-level programs that bootstrap pipeline-aware\ndemonstrations, search for relevant passages, and generate grounded\npredictions, systematically breaking down problems into small transformations\nthat the LM and RM can handle more reliably. We have written novel DSP programs\nfor answering questions in open-domain, multi-hop, and conversational settings,\nestablishing in early evaluations new state-of-the-art in-context learning\nresults and delivering 37-200%, 8-40%, and 80-290% relative gains against\nvanilla LMs, a standard retrieve-then-read pipeline, and a contemporaneous\nself-ask pipeline, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Many problems in machine learning involve bilevel optimization (BLO),\nincluding hyperparameter optimization, meta-learning, and dataset distillation.\nBilevel problems consist of two nested sub-problems, called the outer and inner\nproblems, respectively. In practice, often at least one of these sub-problems\nis overparameterized. In this case, there are many ways to choose among optima\nthat achieve equivalent objective values. Inspired by recent studies of the\nimplicit bias induced by optimization algorithms in single-level optimization,\nwe investigate the implicit bias of gradient-based algorithms for bilevel\noptimization. We delineate two standard BLO methods -- cold-start and\nwarm-start -- and show that the converged solution or long-run behavior depends\nto a large degree on these and other algorithmic choices, such as the\nhypergradient approximation. We also show that the inner solutions obtained by\nwarm-start BLO can encode a surprising amount of information about the outer\nobjective, even when the outer parameters are low-dimensional. We believe that\nimplicit bias deserves as central a role in the study of bilevel optimization\nas it has attained in the study of single-level neural net optimization.",

We contrast the movement in\ndeepfakes and authentic videos by motion magnification towards building a\ngeneralized deepfake source detector.

Our approach exploits the difference between real\nmotion and the amplified GAN fingerprints, by combining deep and traditional\nmotion magnification, to detect whether a video is fake and its source\ngenerator if so. Evaluating our approach on two multi-source datasets, we\nobtain 97.17% and 94.03% for video source detection. We compare against the\nprior deepfake source detector and other complex architectures.

Such black-box models are difficult to comprehend not only for\ntargeted users and decision-makers but also for AI developers. Besides, in\nsensitive areas like healthcare, explainability and accountability are not only\ndesirable properties of AI but also legal requirements -- especially when AI\nmay have significant impacts on human lives. Explainable artificial\nintelligence (XAI) is an emerging field that aims to mitigate the opaqueness of\nblack-box models and make it possible to interpret how AI systems make their\ndecisions with transparency. An interpretable ML model can explain how it makes\npredictions and which factors affect the model's outcomes. The majority of\nstate-of-the-art interpretable ML methods have been developed in a\ndomain-agnostic way and originate from computer vision, automated reasoning, or\neven statistics.

Further, we analyzed the geometry of level sets on the tuning\nlandscapes of CNN units.

    "abstract": "Seismic data often undergoes severe noise due to environmental factors, which\nseriously affects subsequent applications. Traditional hand-crafted denoisers\nsuch as filters and regularizations utilize interpretable domain knowledge to\ndesign generalizable denoising techniques, while their representation\ncapacities may be inferior to deep learning denoisers, which can learn complex\nand representative denoising mappings from abundant training pairs. However,\ndue to the scarcity of high-quality training pairs, deep learning denoisers may\nsustain some generalization issues over various scenarios. In this work, we\npropose a self-supervised method that combines the capacities of deep denoiser\nand the generalization abilities of hand-crafted regularization for seismic\ndata random noise attenuation. Specifically, we leverage the Self2Self (S2S)\nlearning framework with a trace-wise masking strategy for seismic data\ndenoising by solely using the observed noisy data. Parallelly, we suggest the\nweighted total variation (WTV) to further capture the horizontal local smooth\nstructure of seismic data. Our method, dubbed as S2S-WTV, enjoys both high\nrepresentation abilities brought from the self-supervised deep network and good\ngeneralization abilities of the hand-crafted WTV regularizer and the\nself-supervised nature. Therefore, our method can more effectively and stably\nremove the random noise and preserve the details and edges of the clean signal.\nTo tackle the S2S-WTV optimization model, we introduce an alternating direction\nmultiplier method (ADMM)-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on synthetic\nand field noisy seismic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as\ncompared with state-of-the-art traditional and deep learning-based seismic data\ndenoising methods.",

However, it has been discovered that modern deep neural networks\nare generally poorly calibrated due to the overestimation (or underestimation)\nof predictive confidence, which is closely related to overfitting. In this\npaper, we propose Annealing Double-Head, a simple-to-implement but highly\neffective architecture for calibrating the DNN during training. To be precise,\nwe construct an additional calibration head-a shallow neural network that\ntypically has one latent layer-on top of the last latent layer in the normal\nmodel to map the logits to the aligned confidence. Furthermore, a simple\nAnnealing technique that dynamically scales the logits by calibration head in\ntraining procedure is developed to improve its performance. Under both the\nin-distribution and distributional shift circumstances, we exhaustively\nevaluate our Annealing Double-Head architecture on multiple pairs of\ncontemporary DNN architectures and vision and speech datasets.

To\nguarantee excellent reliability performance, pragmatic precoder design is an\neffective and indispensable solution. However, the design requires accurate\ninstantaneous channel state information at the transmitter (ICSIT) which is not\nalways available in practice. Motivated by this, we adopt a deep learning (DL)\napproach to exploit implicit features from estimated historical delay-Doppler\ndomain channels (DDCs) to directly predict the precoder to be adopted in the\nnext time frame for minimizing the frame error rate (FER), that can further\nimprove the system reliability without the acquisition of ICSIT. To this end,\nwe first establish a predictive transmission protocol and formulate a general\nproblem for the precoder design where a closed-form theoretical FER expression\nis derived serving as the objective function to characterize the system\nreliability. Then, we propose a DL-based predictive precoder design framework\nwhich exploits an unsupervised learning mechanism to improve the practicability\nof the proposed scheme. As a realization of the proposed framework, we design a\nDDCs-aware convolutional long short-term memory (CLSTM) network for the\nprecoder design, where both the convolutional neural network and LSTM modules\nare adopted to facilitate the spatial-temporal feature extraction from the\nestimated historical DDCs to further enhance the precoder performance.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme facilitates a flexible\nreliability-latency tradeoff and achieves an excellent FER performance that\napproaches the lower bound obtained by a genie-aided benchmark requiring\nperfect ICSI at both the transmitter and receiver.",

However, large-scale high-fidelity\nsingle-photon imaging remains a big challenge, due to the complex hardware\nmanufacture craft and heavy noise disturbance of SPAD arrays. In this work, we\nintroduce deep learning into SPAD, enabling super-resolution single-photon\nimaging over an order of magnitude, with significant enhancement of bit depth\nand imaging quality. We first studied the complex photon flow model of SPAD\nelectronics to accurately characterize multiple physical noise sources, and\ncollected a real SPAD image dataset (64 $\\times$ 32 pixels, 90 scenes, 10\ndifferent bit depth, 3 different illumination flux, 2790 images in total) to\ncalibrate noise model parameters. With this real-world physical noise model, we\nfor the first time synthesized a large-scale realistic single-photon image\ndataset (image pairs of 5 different resolutions with maximum megapixels, 17250\nscenes, 10 different bit depth, 3 different illumination flux, 2.6 million\nimages in total) for subsequent network training. To tackle the severe\nsuper-resolution challenge of SPAD inputs with low bit depth, low resolution,\nand heavy noise, we further built a deep transformer network with a\ncontent-adaptive self-attention mechanism and gated fusion modules, which can\ndig global contextual features to remove multi-source noise and extract\nfull-frequency details. We applied the technique on a series of experiments\nincluding macroscopic and microscopic imaging, microfluidic inspection, and\nFourier ptychography.

Bayesian optimization algorithms build a\nsurrogate of the objective function by employing Gaussian processes and\nquantify the uncertainty in that surrogate by deriving an acquisition function.\nThis acquisition function represents the probability of improvement based on\nthe kernel of the Gaussian process, which guides the search in the optimization\nprocess. The critical challenge for designing Bayesian optimization algorithms\non manifolds lies in the difficulty of constructing valid covariance kernels\nfor Gaussian processes on general manifolds. Our approach is to employ\nextrinsic Gaussian processes by first embedding the manifold onto some higher\ndimensional Euclidean space via equivariant embeddings and then constructing a\nvalid covariance kernel on the image manifold after the embedding. This leads\nto efficient and scalable algorithms for optimization over complex manifolds.\nSimulation study and real data analysis are carried out to demonstrate the\nutilities of our eBO framework by applying the eBO to various optimization\nproblems over manifolds such as the sphere, the Grassmannian, and the manifold\nof positive definite matrices.",

    "abstract": "Drowsiness reduces concentration and increases response time, which causes\nfatal road accidents. Monitoring drivers' drowsiness levels by\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) and taking action may prevent road accidents. EEG\nsignals effectively monitor the driver's mental state as they can monitor brain\ndynamics. However, calibration is required in advance because EEG signals vary\nbetween and within subjects. Because of the inconvenience, calibration has\nreduced the accessibility of the brain-computer interface (BCI). Developing a\ngeneralized classification model is similar to domain generalization, which\novercomes the domain shift problem. Especially data augmentation is frequently\nused. This paper proposes a calibration-free framework for driver drowsiness\nstate classification using manifold-level augmentation. This framework\nincreases the diversity of source domains by utilizing features. We\nexperimented with various augmentation methods to improve the generalization\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Objective: Imbalances of the electrolyte concentration levels in the body can\nlead to catastrophic consequences, but accurate and accessible measurements\ncould improve patient outcomes. While blood tests provide accurate\nmeasurements, they are invasive and the laboratory analysis can be slow or\ninaccessible. In contrast, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely adopted tool\nwhich is quick and simple to acquire. However, the problem of estimating\ncontinuous electrolyte concentrations directly from ECGs is not well-studied.\nWe therefore investigate if regression methods can be used for accurate\nECG-based prediction of electrolyte concentrations. Methods: We explore the use\nof deep neural networks (DNNs) for this task. We analyze the regression\nperformance across four electrolytes, utilizing a novel dataset containing over\n290000 ECGs. For improved understanding, we also study the full spectrum from\ncontinuous predictions to binary classification of extreme concentration\nlevels. To enhance clinical usefulness, we finally extend to a probabilistic\nregression approach and evaluate different uncertainty estimates. Results: We\nfind that the performance varies significantly between different electrolytes,\nwhich is clinically justified in the interplay of electrolytes and their\nmanifestation in the ECG. We also compare the regression accuracy with that of\ntraditional machine learning models, demonstrating superior performance of\nDNNs. Conclusion: Discretization can lead to good classification performance,\nbut does not help solve the original problem of predicting continuous\nconcentration levels. While probabilistic regression demonstrates potential\npractical usefulness, the uncertainty estimates are not particularly\nwell-calibrated. Significance: Our study is a first step towards accurate and\nreliable ECG-based prediction of electrolyte concentration levels.",

It\nmay become challenging to monitor a limited level of tool wear in the data\ncollected from the machine due to the other components, such as the flexible\nvibrations of the machine, dominating the measurement signals.

Feature engineering is conducted\nto identify the statistical features of the measurement signals that are most\nsensitive to small changes in tool wear. A neural network based on the long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) architecture is developed to predict tool flank wear\nfrom the measured spindle motor current and dynamometer signals.

With the application of deep learning (DL) techniques\nsuch as CNN, recognizing periodic or static activities (e.g, walking, lying,\ncycling, etc.) has become a well studied problem. What remains a major\nchallenge though is the sporadic activity recognition (SAR) problem, where\nactivities of interest tend to be non periodic, and occur less frequently when\ncompared with the often large amount of irrelevant background activities.\nRecent works suggested that sequential DL models (such as LSTMs) have great\npotential for modeling nonperiodic behaviours, and in this paper we studied\nsome LSTM training strategies for SAR. Specifically, we proposed two simple yet\neffective LSTM variants, namely delay model and inverse model, for two SAR\nscenarios (with and without time critical requirement). For time critical SAR,\nthe delay model can effectively exploit predefined delay intervals (within\ntolerance) in form of contextual information for improved performance. For\nregular SAR task, the second proposed, inverse model can learn patterns from\nthe time series in an inverse manner, which can be complementary to the forward\nmodel (i.e.,LSTM), and combining both can boost the performance. These two LSTM\nvariants are very practical, and they can be deemed as training strategies\nwithout alteration of the LSTM fundamentals. We also studied some additional\nLSTM training strategies, which can further improve the accuracy. We evaluated\nour models on two SAR and one non-SAR datasets, and the promising results\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of our approaches in HAR applications.",

One of the major concerns in using ma-chine\nlearning (ML) approaches for automatic processing of CT scan images in clinical\nsetting is that these methods are trained on limited and biased sub-sets of\npublicly available COVID-19 data. This has raised concerns regarding the\ngeneralizability of these models on external datasets, not seen by the model\nduring training. To address some of these issues, in this work CT scan images\nfrom confirmed COVID-19 data obtained from one of the largest public\nrepositories, COVIDx CT 2A were used for training and internal vali-dation of\nmachine learning models. For the external validation we generated\nIndian-COVID-19 CT dataset, an open-source repository containing 3D CT volumes\nand 12096 chest CT images from 288 COVID-19 patients from In-dia. Comparative\nperformance evaluation of four state-of-the-art machine learning models, viz.,\na lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN), and three other CNN based\ndeep learning (DL) models such as VGG-16, ResNet-50 and Inception-v3 in\nclassifying CT images into three classes, viz., normal, non-covid pneumonia,\nand COVID-19 is carried out on these two datasets.

We\nconjectured that a significant deeper network with inceptionV3 units can\nachieve a better feature representation of lung CT images without increasing\nthe model complexity in terms of the number of trainable parameters. The method\nhas three main advantages. First, a U-Net architecture with InceptionV3 blocks\nis developed to resolve the problem of performance degradation and parameter\noverload. Then, using information from consecutive slices, a new data structure\nis created to increase generalization potential, allowing more discriminating\nfeatures to be extracted by making data representation as efficient as\npossible. Finally, the robustness of the proposed segmentation framework was\nquantitatively assessed using one public database to train and test the model\n(LUNA16) and two public databases (ISBI VESSEL12 challenge and CRPF dataset)\nonly for testing the model; each database consists of 700, 23, and 40 CT\nimages, respectively, that were acquired with a different scanner and protocol.\nBased on the experimental results, the proposed method achieved competitive\nresults over the existing techniques with Dice coefficient of 99.7, 99.1, and\n98.8 for LUNA16, VESSEL12, and CRPF datasets, respectively.

    "title": "Anxolotl, an Anxiety Companion App -- Stress Detection",
    "abstract": "Stress has a great effect on people's lives that can not be understated.\nWhile it can be good, since it helps humans to adapt to new and different\nsituations, it can also be harmful when not dealt with properly, leading to\nchronic stress. The objective of this paper is developing a stress monitoring\nsolution, that can be used in real life, while being able to tackle this\nchallenge in a positive way. The SMILE data set was provided to team Anxolotl,\nand all it was needed was to develop a robust model. We developed a supervised\nlearning model for classification in Python, presenting the final result of\n64.1% in accuracy and a f1-score of 54.96%. The resulting solution stood the\nrobustness test, presenting low variation between runs, which was a major point\nfor it's possible integration in the Anxolotl app in the future.",

    "abstract": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a ubiquitous diagnostic modality.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied towards ECG analysis require large\nsample sizes, and transfer learning approaches result in suboptimal performance\nwhen pre-training is done on natural images. We leveraged masked image modeling\nto create the first vision-based transformer model, HeartBEiT, for\nelectrocardiogram waveform analysis. We pre-trained this model on 8.5 million\nECGs and then compared performance vs. standard CNN architectures for diagnosis\nof hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, low left ventricular ejection fraction and ST\nelevation myocardial infarction using differing training sample sizes and\nindependent validation datasets. We show that HeartBEiT has significantly\nhigher performance at lower sample sizes compared to other models. Finally, we\nalso show that HeartBEiT improves explainability of diagnosis by highlighting\nbiologically relevant regions of the EKG vs. standard CNNs. Thus, we present\nthe first vision-based waveform transformer that can be used to develop\nspecialized models for ECG analysis especially at low sample sizes.",
