    "title": "Can Offline Reinforcement Learning Help Natural Language Understanding?",
    "abstract": "Pre-training has been a useful method for learning implicit transferable\nknowledge and it shows the benefit of offering complementary features across\ndifferent modalities. Recent work mainly focuses on the modalities such as\nimage and text, for example, studies show that visual features learned from\nimages can help visual-grounded language understanding. In this paper, we\nconsider investigating the potential connection between offline reinforcement\nlearning (RL) and language modeling (LM). Intuitively, RL and LM are similar in\npredicting the next states based on the current and previous states, which rely\non both local and long-range dependency across states. To validate such an\nassumption, we pre-trained different offline RL tasks using Transformer and\nthen evaluate these models on various language-related tasks. Experimental\nresults show that our RL pre-trained models can give close performance compared\nwith the models using the LM training objective, showing that there exist\ncommon useful features across these two modalities. To further explore the\npotential relationship, we investigate some factors such as Markov property and\nthe sequential nature of RL trajectory.",

    "abstract": "Valuing mineral assets is a challenging task that is highly dependent on the\nsupply (geological) uncertainty surrounding resources and reserves, and the\nuncertainty of demand (commodity prices). In this work, a graph-based\nreasoning, modeling and solution approach is proposed to jointly address\nmineral asset valuation and mine plan scheduling and optimization under supply\nand demand uncertainty in the \"mining complex\" framework. Three graph-based\nsolutions are proposed: (i) a neural branching policy that learns a\nblock-sampling ore body representation, (ii) a guiding policy that learns to\nexplore a heuristic selection tree, (iii) a hyper-heuristic that manages the\nvalue/supply chain optimization and dynamics modeled as a graph structure.\nResults on two large-scale industrial mining complexes show a reduction of up\nto three orders of magnitude in primal suboptimality, execution time, and\nnumber of iterations, and an increase of up to 40% in the mineral asset value.",

    "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful tools for learning latent\nrepresentations of data used in a wide range of applications. In practice, VAEs\nusually require multiple training rounds to choose the amount of information\nthe latent variable should retain. This trade-off between the reconstruction\nerror (distortion) and the KL divergence (rate) is typically parameterized by a\nhyperparameter $\\beta$. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Rate VAE (MR-VAE), a\ncomputationally efficient framework for learning optimal parameters\ncorresponding to various $\\beta$ in a single training run. The key idea is to\nexplicitly formulate a response function that maps $\\beta$ to the optimal\nparameters using hypernetworks. MR-VAEs construct a compact response\nhypernetwork where the pre-activations are conditionally gated based on\n$\\beta$. We justify the proposed architecture by analyzing linear VAEs and\nshowing that it can represent response functions exactly for linear VAEs. With\nthe learned hypernetwork, MR-VAEs can construct the rate-distortion curve\nwithout additional training and can be deployed with significantly less\nhyperparameter tuning. Empirically, our approach is competitive and often\nexceeds the performance of multiple $\\beta$-VAEs training with minimal\ncomputation and memory overheads.",

We start by deriving a novel bound on the\nperformance gap based on Wasserstein distance, applicable for continuous-action\nexperts, holding under the assumption that the value function is Lipschitz\ncontinuous. Since this latter condition is hardy fulfilled in practice, even\nfor Lipschitz Markov Decision Processes and policies, we propose a relaxed\nsetting, proving that value function is always Holder continuous.

    "abstract": "In off-policy reinforcement learning, a behaviour policy performs exploratory\ninteractions with the environment to obtain state-action-reward samples which\nare then used to learn a target policy that optimises the expected return. This\nleads to a problem of off-policy evaluation, where one needs to evaluate the\ntarget policy from samples collected by the often unrelated behaviour policy.\nImportance sampling is a traditional statistical technique that is often\napplied to off-policy evaluation. While importance sampling estimators are\nunbiased, their variance increases exponentially with the horizon of the\ndecision process due to computing the importance weight as a product of action\nprobability ratios, yielding estimates with low accuracy for domains involving\nlong-term planning. This paper proposes state-based importance sampling (SIS),\nwhich drops the action probability ratios of sub-trajectories with \"neglible\nstates\" -- roughly speaking, those for which the chosen actions have no impact\non the return estimate -- from the computation of the importance weight.\nTheoretical results show that this results in a reduction of the exponent in\nthe variance upper bound as well as improving the mean squared error. An\nautomated search algorithm based on covariance testing is proposed to identify\na negligible state set which has minimal MSE when performing state-based\nimportance sampling. Experiments are conducted on a lift domain, which include\n\"lift states\" where the action has no impact on the following state and reward.\nThe results demonstrate that using the search algorithm, SIS yields reduced\nvariance and improved accuracy compared to traditional importance sampling,\nper-decision importance sampling, and incremental importance sampling.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have constantly achieved better\nperformance over years by introducing more complex topology, and enlarging the\ncapacity towards deeper and wider CNNs. This makes the manual design of CNNs\nextremely difficult, so the automated design of CNNs has come into the research\nspotlight, which has obtained CNNs that outperform manually-designed CNNs.\nHowever, the computational cost is still the bottleneck of automatically\ndesigning CNNs. In this paper, inspired by transfer learning, a new\nevolutionary computation based framework is proposed to efficiently evolve CNNs\nwithout compromising the classification accuracy. The proposed framework\nleverages multi-source domains, which are smaller datasets than the target\ndomain datasets, to evolve a generalised CNN block only once. And then, a new\nstacking method is proposed to both widen and deepen the evolved block, and a\ngrid search method is proposed to find optimal stacking solutions. The\nexperimental results show the proposed method acquires good CNNs faster than 15\npeer competitors within less than 40 GPU-hours. Regarding the classification\naccuracy, the proposed method gains its strong competitiveness against the peer\ncompetitors, which achieves the best error rates of 3.46%, 18.36% and 1.76% for\nthe CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Along with the widespread use of face recognition systems, their\nvulnerability has become highlighted. While existing face anti-spoofing methods\ncan be generalized between attack types, generic solutions are still\nchallenging due to the diversity of spoof characteristics. Recently, the spoof\ntrace disentanglement framework has shown great potential for coping with both\nseen and unseen spoof scenarios, but the performance is largely restricted by\nthe single-modal input. This paper focuses on this issue and presents a\nmulti-modal disentanglement model which targetedly learns polysemantic spoof\ntraces for more accurate and robust generic attack detection. In particular,\nbased on the adversarial learning mechanism, a two-stream disentangling network\nis designed to estimate spoof patterns from the RGB and depth inputs,\nrespectively. In this case, it captures complementary spoofing clues inhering\nin different attacks. Furthermore, a fusion module is exploited, which\nrecalibrates both representations at multiple stages to promote the\ndisentanglement in each individual modality. It then performs cross-modality\naggregation to deliver a more comprehensive spoof trace representation for\nprediction. Extensive evaluations are conducted on multiple benchmarks,\ndemonstrating that learning polysemantic spoof traces favorably contributes to\nanti-spoofing with more perceptible and interpretable results.",

    "abstract": "Everting, soft growing vine robots benefit from reduced friction with their\nenvironment, which allows them to navigate challenging terrain. Vine robots can\nuse air pouches attached to their sides for lateral steering. However, when all\npouches are serially connected, the whole robot can only perform one constant\ncurvature in free space. It must contact the environment to navigate through\nobstacles along paths with multiple turns. This work presents a multi-segment\nvine robot that can navigate complex paths without interacting with its\nenvironment. This is achieved by a new steering method that selectively\nactuates each single pouch at the tip, providing high degrees of freedom with\nfew control inputs. A small magnetic valve connects each pouch to a pressure\nsupply line. A motorized tip mount uses an interlocking mechanism and motorized\nrollers on the outer material of the vine robot. As each valve passes through\nthe tip mount, a permanent magnet inside the tip mount opens the valve so the\ncorresponding pouch is connected to the pressure supply line at the same\nmoment. Novel cylindrical pneumatic artificial muscles (cPAMs) are integrated\ninto the vine robot and inflate to a cylindrical shape for improved bending\ncharacteristics compared to other state-of-the art vine robots. The motorized\ntip mount controls a continuous eversion speed and enables controlled\nretraction. A final prototype was able to repeatably grow into different shapes\nand hold these shapes. We predict the path using a model that assumes a\npiecewise constant curvature along the outside of the multi-segment vine robot.\nThe proposed multi-segment steering method can be extended to other soft\ncontinuum robot designs.",

UberNet empploys a multivariate framework that utilises\na number of temporal and spatial features that have been found in the\nliterature to explain demand for ride-hailing services. The proposed model\nincludes two sub-networks that aim to encode the source series of various\nfeatures and decode the predicting series, respectively. To assess the\nperformance and effectiveness of UberNet, we use 9 months of Uber pickup data\nin 2014 and 28 spatial and temporal features from New York City. By comparing\nthe performance of UberNet with several other approaches, we show that the\nprediction quality of the model is highly competitive. Further, Ubernet's\nprediction performance is better when using economic, social and built\nenvironment features. This suggests that Ubernet is more naturally suited to\nincluding complex motivators in making real-time passenger demand predictions\nfor ride-hailing services.",

    "abstract": "Recently, automated co-design of machine learning (ML) models and accelerator\narchitectures has attracted significant attention from both the industry and\nacademia. However, most co-design frameworks either explore a limited search\nspace or employ suboptimal exploration techniques for simultaneous design\ndecision investigations of the ML model and the accelerator. Furthermore,\ntraining the ML model and simulating the accelerator performance is\ncomputationally expensive. To address these limitations, this work proposes a\nnovel neural architecture and hardware accelerator co-design framework, called\nCODEBench. It is composed of two new benchmarking sub-frameworks, CNNBench and\nAccelBench, which explore expanded design spaces of convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) and CNN accelerators. CNNBench leverages an advanced search\ntechnique, BOSHNAS, to efficiently train a neural heteroscedastic surrogate\nmodel to converge to an optimal CNN architecture by employing second-order\ngradients. AccelBench performs cycle-accurate simulations for a diverse set of\naccelerator architectures in a vast design space. With the proposed co-design\nmethod, called BOSHCODE, our best CNN-accelerator pair achieves 1.4% higher\naccuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset compared to the state-of-the-art pair, while\nenabling 59.1% lower latency and 60.8% lower energy consumption. On the\nImageNet dataset, it achieves 3.7% higher Top1 accuracy at 43.8% lower latency\nand 11.2% lower energy consumption. CODEBench outperforms the state-of-the-art\nframework, i.e., Auto-NBA, by achieving 1.5% higher accuracy and 34.7x higher\nthroughput, while enabling 11.0x lower energy-delay product (EDP) and 4.0x\nlower chip area on CIFAR-10.",

Traditional drought indices describe mainly\nbiophysical variables and not impacts on social, economic, and environmental\nsystems.

Our model achieved a satisfying macro-F1\nscore of 0.89 on the DIR test set. The model was then applied to California\ntweets and validated with keyword-based labels. The macro-F1 score was 0.58.\nHowever, due to the limitation of keywords, we also spot-checked tweets with\ncontroversial labels. 83.5% of BERT labels were correct compared to the keyword\nlabels.

    "abstract": "Gathering properly labelled, adequately rich, and case-specific data for\nsuccessfully training a data-driven or hybrid model for structural health\nmonitoring (SHM) applications is a challenging task. We posit that a Transfer\nLearning (TL) method that utilizes available data in any relevant source domain\nand directly applies to the target domain through domain adaptation can provide\nsubstantial remedies to address this issue. Accordingly, we present a novel TL\nmethod that differentiates between the source's no-damage and damage cases and\nutilizes a domain adaptation (DA) technique. The DA module transfers the\naccumulated knowledge in contrasting no-damage and damage cases in the source\ndomain to the target domain, given only the target's no-damage case.\nHigh-dimensional features allow employing signal processing domain knowledge to\ndevise a generalizable DA approach. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\narchitecture is adopted for learning since its optimization process\naccommodates high-dimensional inputs in a zero-shot setting. At the same time,\nits training objective conforms seamlessly with the case of no-damage and\ndamage data in SHM since its discriminator network differentiates between real\n(no damage) and fake (possibly unseen damage) data. An extensive set of\nexperimental results demonstrates the method's success in transferring\nknowledge on differences between no-damage and damage cases across three\nstrongly heterogeneous independent target structures. The area under the\nReceiver Operating Characteristics curves (Area Under the Curve - AUC) is used\nto evaluate the differentiation between no-damage and damage cases in the\ntarget domain, reaching values as high as 0.95. With no-damage and damage cases\ndiscerned from each other, zero-shot structural damage detection is carried\nout. The mean F1 scores for all damages in the three independent datasets are\n0.978, 0.992, and 0.975.",

In several applications like\nneuroscience, image compression or deep reinforcement learning, the principal\nsubspace of such a matrix provides a useful, low-dimensional representation of\nindividual data. Here, we are interested in determining the $d$-dimensional\nprincipal subspace of a given matrix from sample entries, i.e. from small\nrandom submatrices.

Our method consists in defining a loss\nfunction whose minimizer is the desired principal subspace, and constructing a\ngradient estimate of this loss whose bias can be controlled.

    "abstract": "Many modern software systems are enabled by deep learning libraries such as\nTensorFlow and PyTorch. As deep learning is now prevalent, the security of deep\nlearning libraries is a key concern. Fuzzing deep learning libraries presents\ntwo challenges. Firstly, to reach the functionality of the libraries, fuzzers\nhave to use inputs from the valid input domain of each API function, which may\nbe unknown. Secondly, many inputs are redundant. Randomly sampled invalid\ninputs are likely not to trigger new behaviors. While existing approaches\npartially address the first challenge, they overlook the second challenge.\nWe propose SkipFuzz, an approach for fuzzing deep learning libraries. To\ngenerate valid inputs, SkipFuzz learns the input constraints of each API\nfunction using active learning. By using information gained during fuzzing,\nSkipFuzz infers a model of the input constraints, and, thus, generate valid\ninputs. SkipFuzz comprises an active learner which queries a test executor to\nobtain feedback for inference. After constructing hypotheses, the active\nlearner poses queries and refines the hypotheses using the feedback from the\ntest executor, which indicates if the library accepts or rejects an input,\ni.e., if it satisfies the input constraints or not. Inputs from different\ncategories are used to invoke the library to check if a set of inputs satisfies\na function's input constraints. Inputs in one category are distinguished from\nother categories by possible input constraints they would satisfy, e.g. they\nare tensors of a certain shape. As such, SkipFuzz is able to refine its\nhypothesis by eliminating possible candidates of the input constraints. This\nactive learning-based approach addresses the challenge of redundant inputs.\nUsing SkipFuzz, we have found and reported 43 crashes. 28 of them have been\nconfirmed, with 13 unique CVEs assigned.",

    "abstract": "We study a challenging task, conditional human motion generation, which\nproduces plausible human motion sequences according to various conditional\ninputs, such as action classes or textual descriptors. Since human motions are\nhighly diverse and have a property of quite different distribution from\nconditional modalities, such as textual descriptors in natural languages, it is\nhard to learn a probabilistic mapping from the desired conditional modality to\nthe human motion sequences. Besides, the raw motion data from the motion\ncapture system might be redundant in sequences and contain noises; directly\nmodeling the joint distribution over the raw motion sequences and conditional\nmodalities would need a heavy computational overhead and might result in\nartifacts introduced by the captured noises. To learn a better representation\nof the various human motion sequences, we first design a powerful Variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) and arrive at a representative and low-dimensional latent\ncode for a human motion sequence. Then, instead of using a diffusion model to\nestablish the connections between the raw motion sequences and the conditional\ninputs, we perform a diffusion process on the motion latent space. Our proposed\nMotion Latent-based Diffusion model (MLD) could produce vivid motion sequences\nconforming to the given conditional inputs and substantially reduce the\ncomputational overhead in both the training and inference stages. Extensive\nexperiments on various human motion generation tasks demonstrate that our MLD\nachieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods among\nextensive human motion generation tasks, with two orders of magnitude faster\nthan previous diffusion models on raw motion sequences.",

    "title": "Learning to Dub Movies via Hierarchical Prosody Models",
    "abstract": "Given a piece of text, a video clip and a reference audio, the movie dubbing\n(also known as visual voice clone V2C) task aims to generate speeches that\nmatch the speaker's emotion presented in the video using the desired speaker\nvoice as reference. V2C is more challenging than conventional text-to-speech\ntasks as it additionally requires the generated speech to exactly match the\nvarying emotions and speaking speed presented in the video. Unlike previous\nworks, we propose a novel movie dubbing architecture to tackle these problems\nvia hierarchical prosody modelling, which bridges the visual information to\ncorresponding speech prosody from three aspects: lip, face, and scene.\nSpecifically, we align lip movement to the speech duration, and convey facial\nexpression to speech energy and pitch via attention mechanism based on valence\nand arousal representations inspired by recent psychology findings. Moreover,\nwe design an emotion booster to capture the atmosphere from global video\nscenes. All these embeddings together are used to generate mel-spectrogram and\nthen convert to speech waves via existing vocoder. Extensive experimental\nresults on the Chem and V2C benchmark datasets demonstrate the favorable\nperformance of the proposed method. The source code and trained models will be\nreleased to the public.",

    "title": "Logit Clipping for Robust Learning against Label Noise",
    "abstract": "In the presence of noisy labels, designing robust loss functions is critical\nfor securing the generalization performance of deep neural networks. Cross\nEntropy (CE) loss has been shown to be not robust to noisy labels due to its\nunboundedness. To alleviate this issue, existing works typically design\nspecialized robust losses with the symmetric condition, which usually lead to\nthe underfitting issue. In this paper, our key idea is to induce a loss bound\nat the logit level, thus universally enhancing the noise robustness of existing\nlosses. Specifically, we propose logit clipping (LogitClip), which clamps the\nnorm of the logit vector to ensure that it is upper bounded by a constant. In\nthis manner, CE loss equipped with our LogitClip method is effectively bounded,\nmitigating the overfitting to examples with noisy labels. Moreover, we present\ntheoretical analyses to certify the noise-tolerant ability of LogitClip.\nExtensive experiments show that LogitClip not only significantly improves the\nnoise robustness of CE loss, but also broadly enhances the generalization\nperformance of popular robust losses.",

    "title": "AutoPINN: When AutoML Meets Physics-Informed Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently been proposed to solve\nscientific and engineering problems, where physical laws are introduced into\nneural networks as prior knowledge. With the embedded physical laws, PINNs\nenable the estimation of critical parameters, which are unobservable via\nphysical tools, through observable variables. For example, Power Electronic\nConverters (PECs) are essential building blocks for the green energy\ntransition. PINNs have been applied to estimate the capacitance, which is\nunobservable during PEC operations, using current and voltage, which can be\nobserved easily during operations. The estimated capacitance facilitates\nself-diagnostics of PECs. Existing PINNs are often manually designed, which is\ntime-consuming and may lead to suboptimal performance due to a large number of\ndesign choices for neural network architectures and hyperparameters. In\naddition, PINNs are often deployed on different physical devices, e.g., PECs,\nwith limited and varying resources. Therefore, it requires designing different\nPINN models under different resource constraints, making it an even more\nchallenging task for manual design. To contend with the challenges, we propose\nAutomated Physics-Informed Neural Networks (AutoPINN), a framework that enables\nthe automated design of PINNs by combining AutoML and PINNs. Specifically, we\nfirst tailor a search space that allows finding high-accuracy PINNs for PEC\ninternal parameter estimation. We then propose a resource-aware search strategy\nto explore the search space to find the best PINN model under different\nresource constraints. We experimentally demonstrate that AutoPINN is able to\nfind more accurate PINN models than human-designed, state-of-the-art PINN\nmodels using fewer resources.",

    "abstract": "As more and more artificial intelligence (AI) technologies move from the\nlaboratory to real-world applications, the open-set and robustness challenges\nbrought by data from the real world have received increasing attention. Data\naugmentation is a widely used method to improve model performance, and some\nrecent works have also confirmed its positive effect on the robustness of AI\nmodels. However, most of the existing data augmentation methods are heuristic,\nlacking the exploration of their internal mechanisms. We apply the explainable\nartificial intelligence (XAI) method, explore the internal mechanisms of\npopular data augmentation methods, analyze the relationship between game\ninteractions and some widely used robustness metrics, and propose a new proxy\nfor model robustness in the open-set environment. Based on the analysis of the\ninternal mechanisms, we develop a mask-based boosting method for data\naugmentation that comprehensively improves several robustness measures of AI\nmodels and beats state-of-the-art data augmentation approaches. Experiments\nshow that our method can be widely applied to many popular data augmentation\nmethods.

In this\npaper, we first show that in a multi-AU setting, changing the camera setting\nhas disproportionate impact on different AUs performance. In particular, the\noptimal setting for one AU may severely degrade the performance for another AU,\nand further the impact on different AUs varies as the environmental condition\nchanges. We then present Elixir, a system to enhance the video stream quality\nfor multiple analytics on a video stream. Elixir leverages Multi-Objective\nReinforcement Learning (MORL), where the RL agent caters to the objectives from\ndifferent AUs and adjusts the camera setting to simultaneously enhance the\nperformance of all AUs. To define the multiple objectives in MORL, we develop\nnew AU-specific quality estimator values for each individual AU. We evaluate\nElixir through real-world experiments on a testbed with three cameras deployed\nnext to each other (overlooking a large enterprise parking lot) running Elixir\nand two baseline approaches, respectively. Elixir correctly detects 7.1%\n(22,068) and 5.0% (15,731) more cars, 94% (551) and 72% (478) more faces, and\n670.4% (4975) and 158.6% (3507) more persons than the default-setting and\ntime-sharing approaches, respectively. It also detects 115 license plates, far\nmore than the time-sharing approach (7) and the default setting (0).",

The CRC design seeks to\noptimize the frame error rate (FER) performance of the code resulting from the\nconcatenation of the CRC and the CC. Utilization of the dual trellis proposed\nby Yamada et al. lowers the complexity of CRC-aided serial list Viterbi\ndecoding (SLVD) of ZTCCs and TBCCs. CRC-aided SLVD of the TBCCs closely\napproaches the RCU bound at a blocklength of 128.

As an\nextremely challenging task, its difficulties root in the drastic view changes\nand different capturing time between two views. Despite these difficulties,\nrecent works achieve outstanding progress on cross-view geo-localization\nbenchmarks. However, existing methods still suffer from poor performance on the\ncross-area benchmarks, in which the training and testing data are captured from\ntwo different regions. We attribute this deficiency to the lack of ability to\nextract the spatial configuration of visual feature layouts and models'\noverfitting on low-level details from the training set. In this paper, we\npropose GeoDTR which explicitly disentangles geometric information from raw\nfeatures and learns the spatial correlations among visual features from aerial\nand ground pairs with a novel geometric layout extractor module. This module\ngenerates a set of geometric layout descriptors, modulating the raw features\nand producing high-quality latent representations. In addition, we elaborate on\ntwo categories of data augmentations, (i) Layout simulation, which varies the\nspatial configuration while keeping the low-level details intact. (ii) Semantic\naugmentation, which alters the low-level details and encourages the model to\ncapture spatial configurations. These augmentations help to improve the\nperformance of the cross-view geo-localization models, especially on the\ncross-area benchmarks.

In brief,\non the one hand, due to the poor recognizability and viewpoint differences\nbetween images, it is inevitable to inaccurately annotate some keypoints with\noffset and confusion, leading to the mismatch between two associated nodes,\ni.e., NNC. On the other hand, the noisy node-to-node correspondence will\nfurther contaminate the edge-to-edge correspondence, thus leading to ENC. For\nthe BNC challenge, we propose a novel method termed Contrastive Matching with\nMomentum Distillation. Specifically, the proposed method is with a robust\nquadratic contrastive loss which enjoys the following merits: i) better\nexploring the node-to-node and edge-to-edge correlations through a GM\ncustomized quadratic contrastive learning paradigm; ii) adaptively penalizing\nthe noisy assignments based on the confidence estimated by the momentum\nteacher.

In this work, we\npropose a new paradigm for steering the behavior of neural networks, centered\naround \\textit{task vectors}. A task vector specifies a direction in the weight\nspace of a pre-trained model, such that movement in that direction improves\nperformance on the task. We build task vectors by subtracting the weights of a\npre-trained model from the weights of the same model after fine-tuning on a\ntask.

Negating a task vector decreases\nperformance on the target task, with little change in model behavior on control\ntasks. Moreover, adding task vectors together can improve performance on\nmultiple tasks at once. Finally, when tasks are linked by an analogy\nrelationship of the form ``A is to B as C is to D\", combining task vectors from\nthree of the tasks can improve performance on the fourth, even when no data\nfrom the fourth task is used for training.

Recent\nworks leverage the capabilities of large language models (LMs) to perform\ncomplex question answering in a few-shot setting by demonstrating how to output\nintermediate rationalizations while solving the complex question in a single\npass. We introduce ``Successive Prompting'', where we iteratively break down a\ncomplex task into a simple task, solve it, and then repeat the process until we\nget the final solution. Successive prompting decouples the supervision for\ndecomposing complex questions from the supervision for answering simple\nquestions, allowing us to (1) have multiple opportunities to query in-context\nexamples at each reasoning step (2) learn question decomposition separately\nfrom question answering, including using synthetic data, and (3) use bespoke\n(fine-tuned) components for reasoning steps where a large LM does not perform\nwell. The intermediate supervision is typically manually written, which can be\nexpensive to collect. We introduce a way to generate a synthetic dataset which\ncan be used to bootstrap a model's ability to decompose and answer intermediate\nquestions.

Previous work\nidentifies that the spatial arrangement of latent encodings is important to\nrecover detail. One school of thought is to encode a latent vector for each\npoint (point latents). Another school of thought is to project point latents\ninto a grid (grid latents) which could be a voxel grid or triplane grid. Each\nschool of thought has tradeoffs. Grid latents are coarse and lose\nhigh-frequency detail. In contrast, point latents preserve detail. However,\npoint latents are more difficult to decode into a surface, and quality and\nruntime suffer. In this paper, we propose ALTO to sequentially alternate\nbetween geometric representations, before converging to an easy-to-decode\nlatent. We find that this preserves spatial expressiveness and makes decoding\nlightweight. We validate ALTO on implicit 3D recovery and observe not only a\nperformance improvement over the state-of-the-art, but a runtime improvement of\n3-10$\\times$.

    "abstract": "Most shadow removal methods rely on the invasion of training images\nassociated with laborious and lavish shadow region annotations, leading to the\nincreasing popularity of shadow image synthesis. However, the poor performance\nalso stems from these synthesized images since they are often\nshadow-inauthentic and details-impaired. In this paper, we present a novel\ngeneration framework, referred to as HQSS, for high-quality pseudo shadow image\nsynthesis. The given image is first decoupled into a shadow region identity and\na non-shadow region identity. HQSS employs a shadow feature encoder and a\ngenerator to synthesize pseudo images. Specifically, the encoder extracts the\nshadow feature of a region identity which is then paired with another region\nidentity to serve as the generator input to synthesize a pseudo image. The\npseudo image is expected to have the shadow feature as its input shadow feature\nand as well as a real-like image detail as its input region identity. To\nfulfill this goal, we design three learning objectives. When the shadow feature\nand input region identity are from the same region identity, we propose a\nself-reconstruction loss that guides the generator to reconstruct an identical\npseudo image as its input. When the shadow feature and input region identity\nare from different identities, we introduce an inter-reconstruction loss and a\ncycle-reconstruction loss to make sure that shadow characteristics and detail\ninformation can be well retained in the synthesized images. Our HQSS is\nobserved to outperform the state-of-the-art methods on ISTD dataset, Video\nShadow Removal dataset, and SRD dataset. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/zysxmu/HQSS.",

    "abstract": "Surround-view fisheye perception under valet parking scenes is fundamental\nand crucial in autonomous driving. Environmental conditions in parking lots\nperform differently from the common public datasets, such as imperfect light\nand opacity, which substantially impacts on perception performance. Most\nexisting networks based on public datasets may generalize suboptimal results on\nthese valet parking scenes, also affected by the fisheye distortion. In this\narticle, we introduce a new large-scale fisheye dataset called Fisheye Parking\nDataset(FPD) to promote the research in dealing with diverse real-world\nsurround-view parking cases. Notably, our compiled FPD exhibits excellent\ncharacteristics for different surround-view perception tasks. In addition, we\nalso propose our real-time distortion-insensitive multi-task framework Fisheye\nPerception Network (FPNet), which improves the surround-view fisheye BEV\nperception by enhancing the fisheye distortion operation and multi-task\nlightweight designs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our\napproach and the dataset's exceptional generalizability.",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformer (ViT) extracts the final representation from either class\ntoken or an average of all patch tokens, following the architecture of\nTransformer in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) in computer vision. However, studies for the best way of\naggregating the patch tokens are still limited to average pooling, while\nwidely-used pooling strategies, such as max and GeM pooling, can be considered.\nDespite their effectiveness, the existing pooling strategies do not consider\nthe architecture of ViT and the channel-wise difference in the activation maps,\naggregating the crucial and trivial channels with the same importance. In this\npaper, we present Group Generalized Mean (GGeM) pooling as a simple yet\npowerful pooling strategy for ViT. GGeM divides the channels into groups and\ncomputes GeM pooling with a shared pooling parameter per group. As ViT groups\nthe channels via a multi-head attention mechanism, grouping the channels by\nGGeM leads to lower head-wise dependence while amplifying important channels on\nthe activation maps. Exploiting GGeM shows 0.1%p to 0.7%p performance boosts\ncompared to the baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance for\nViT-Base and ViT-Large models in ImageNet-1K classification task. Moreover,\nGGeM outperforms the existing pooling strategies on image retrieval and\nmulti-modal representation learning tasks, demonstrating the superiority of\nGGeM for a variety of tasks.

    "abstract": "In the field of autonomous robots, reinforcement learning (RL) is an\nincreasingly used method to solve the task of dynamic obstacle avoidance for\nmobile robots, autonomous ships, and drones. A common practice to train those\nagents is to use a training environment with random initialization of agent and\nobstacles. Such approaches might suffer from a low coverage of high-risk\nscenarios in training, leading to impaired final performance of obstacle\navoidance. This paper proposes a general training environment where we gain\ncontrol over the difficulty of the obstacle avoidance task by using short\ntraining episodes and assessing the difficulty by two metrics: The number of\nobstacles and a collision risk metric. We found that shifting the training\ntowards a greater task difficulty can massively increase the final performance.\nA baseline agent, using a traditional training environment based on random\ninitialization of agent and obstacles and longer training episodes, leads to a\nsignificantly weaker performance. To prove the generalizability of the proposed\napproach, we designed two realistic use cases: A mobile robot and a maritime\nship under the threat of approaching obstacles. In both applications, the\nprevious results can be confirmed, which emphasizes the general usability of\nthe proposed approach, detached from a specific application context and\nindependent of the agent's dynamics. We further added Gaussian noise to the\nsensor signals, resulting in only a marginal degradation of performance and\nthus indicating solid robustness of the trained agent.",

    "abstract": "Large deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in many\nscenarios. However, training large models is usually challenging, e.g., due to\nthe high computational cost, the unstable and painfully slow optimization\nprocedure, and the vulnerability to overfitting. To alleviate these problems,\nthis work studies a divide-and-conquer strategy, i.e., dividing a large model\ninto smaller modules, training them independently, and reassembling the trained\nmodules to obtain the target model. This approach is promising since it avoids\ndirectly training large models from scratch. Nevertheless, implementing this\nidea is non-trivial, as it is difficult to ensure the compatibility of the\nindependently trained modules. In this paper, we present an elegant solution to\naddress this issue, i.e., we introduce a global, shared meta model to\nimplicitly link all the modules together. This enables us to train highly\ncompatible modules that collaborate effectively when they are assembled\ntogether. We further propose a module incubation mechanism that enables the\nmeta model to be designed as an extremely shallow network. As a result, the\nadditional overhead introduced by the meta model is minimalized. Though\nconceptually simple, our method significantly outperforms end-to-end (E2E)\ntraining in terms of both final accuracy and training efficiency. For example,\non top of ViT-Huge, it improves the accuracy by 2.7% compared to the E2E\nbaseline on ImageNet-1K, while saving the training cost by 43% in the meantime.\nCode is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/Model-Assembling.",

Due to\nthe lack of other agents' dynamics and control policies, deep neural network\n(DNN) models are often employed for trajectory forecasting tasks. Although\nthere exists an extensive literature on improving the accuracy of these models,\nthere is a very limited number of works studying their robustness against\nadversarially crafted input trajectories. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we\npropose a targeted adversarial attack against DNN models for trajectory\nforecasting tasks. We call the proposed attack TA4TP for Targeted adversarial\nAttack for Trajectory Prediction. Our approach generates adversarial input\ntrajectories that are capable of fooling DNN models into predicting\nuser-specified target/desired trajectories. Our attack relies on solving a\nnonlinear constrained optimization problem where the objective function\ncaptures the deviation of the predicted trajectory from a target one while the\nconstraints model physical requirements that the adversarial input should\nsatisfy. The latter ensures that the inputs look natural and they are safe to\nexecute (e.g., they are close to nominal inputs and away from obstacles). We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of TA4TP on two state-of-the-art DNN models and\ntwo datasets.

    "abstract": "Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to adapt the source model to\ncontinually changing unlabeled target domains without access to the source\ndata. Existing methods mainly focus on model-based adaptation in a\nself-training manner, such as predicting pseudo labels for new domain datasets.\nSince pseudo labels are noisy and unreliable, these methods suffer from\ncatastrophic forgetting and error accumulation when dealing with dynamic data\ndistributions. Motivated by the prompt learning in NLP, in this paper, we\npropose to learn an image-level visual domain prompt for target domains while\nhaving the source model parameters frozen. During testing, the changing target\ndatasets can be adapted to the source model by reformulating the input data\nwith the learned visual prompts. Specifically, we devise two types of prompts,\ni.e., domains-specific prompts and domains-agnostic prompts, to extract current\ndomain knowledge and maintain the domain-shared knowledge in the continual\nadaptation. Furthermore, we design a homeostasis-based prompt adaptation\nstrategy to suppress domain-sensitive parameters in domain-invariant prompts to\nlearn domain-shared knowledge more effectively. This transition from the\nmodel-dependent paradigm to the model-free one enables us to bypass the\ncatastrophic forgetting and error accumulation problems.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study two challenging but less-touched problems in image\nrestoration, namely, i) how to quantify the relationship between different\nimage degradations and ii) how to improve the performance of a specific\nrestoration task using the quantified relationship. To tackle the first\nchallenge, Degradation Relationship Index (DRI) is proposed to measure the\ndegradation relationship, which is defined as the drop rate difference in the\nvalidation loss between two models, i.e., one is trained using the anchor task\nonly and another is trained using the anchor and the auxiliary tasks. Through\nquantifying the relationship between different degradations using DRI, we\nempirically observe that i) the degradation combination proportion is crucial\nto the image restoration performance. In other words, the combinations with\nonly appropriate degradation proportions could improve the performance of the\nanchor restoration; ii) a positive DRI always predicts the performance\nimprovement of image restoration. Based on the observations, we propose an\nadaptive Degradation Proportion Determination strategy (DPD) which could\nimprove the performance of the anchor restoration task by using another\nrestoration task as auxiliary. Extensive experimental results verify the\neffective of our method by taking image dehazing as the anchor task and\ndenoising, desnowing, and deraining as the auxiliary tasks. The code will be\nreleased after acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Blokchain is a promising technology to enable distributed and reliable data\nsharing at the network edge. The high security in blockchain is undoubtedly a\ncritical factor for the network to handle important data item. On the other\nhand, according to the dilemma in blockchain, an overemphasis on distributed\nsecurity will lead to poor transaction-processing capability, which limits the\napplication of blockchain in data sharing scenarios with high-throughput and\nlow-latency requirements. To enable demand-oriented distributed services, this\npaper investigates the relationship between capability and security in\nblockchain from the perspective of block propagation and forking problem.\nFirst, a Markov chain is introduced to analyze the gossiping-based block\npropagation among edge servers, which aims to derive block propagation delay\nand forking probability. Then, we study the impact of forking on blockchain\ncapability and security metrics, in terms of transaction throughput,\nconfirmation delay, fault tolerance, and the probability of malicious\nmodification. The analytical results show that with the adjustment of block\ngeneration time or block size, transaction throughput improves at the sacrifice\nof fault tolerance, and vice versa. Meanwhile, the decline in security can be\noffset by adjusting confirmation threshold, at the cost of increasing\nconfirmation delay. The analysis of capability-security trade-off can provide a\ntheoretical guideline to manage blockchain performance based on the\nrequirements of data sharing scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Digital security has been an active area of research interest due to the\nrapid adaptation of internet infrastructure, the increasing popularity of\nsocial media, and digital cameras. Due to inherent differences in working\nprinciples to generate an image, different camera brands left behind different\nintrinsic processing noises which can be used to identify the camera brand. In\nthe last decade, many signal processing and deep learning-based methods have\nbeen proposed to identify and isolate this noise from the scene details in an\nimage to detect the source camera brand. One prominent solution is to utilize a\nhierarchical classification system rather than the traditional\nsingle-classifier approach. Different individual networks are used for\nbrand-level and model-level source camera identification. This approach allows\nfor better scaling and requires minimal modifications for adding a new camera\nbrand/model to the solution. However, using different full-fledged networks for\nboth brand and model-level classification substantially increases memory\nconsumption and training complexity. Moreover, extracted low-level features\nfrom the different network's initial layers often coincide, resulting in\nredundant weights. To mitigate the training and memory complexity, we propose a\nclassifier-block-level hierarchical system instead of a network-level one for\nsource camera model classification. Our proposed approach not only results in\nsignificantly fewer parameters but also retains the capability to add a new\ncamera model with minimal modification. Thorough experimentation on the\npublicly available Dresden dataset shows that our proposed approach can achieve\nthe same level of state-of-the-art performance but requires fewer parameters\ncompared to a state-of-the-art network-level hierarchical-based system.",

Through the monitoring of wireless\ncharging equipment, the radiation level and distribution of the electric field\nvalue and magnetic field value around the charging equipment is explored, to\nanalyze the influence law of the electromagnetic environment. Method This paper\nintroduces the principle and development status of electric vehicle charging,\nand analyzes the classification and methods of wireless charging. In this\npaper, the electric field and magnetic field of cars and minibuses are\nmonitored, at positions such as: around the body, attenuation section, inside\nthe car and inside the minibus. Result The range of electric field strength is\n0.9 V/m to 48.1 V/m for cars, and 0.8 V/m to 74.7 V/m for minibuses. The\nelectric field strength decays rapidly with the increase of the distance from\nthe vehicle body, and the law is obvious. The range of magnetic induction\nintensity is 0.12{\\mu}T-12.70{\\mu}T for cars, and 0.15{\\mu}T-27.06{\\mu}T for\nminibuses.

PredicTor is tailored to minimizing latency in the network and\nachieving max-min fairness. We contribute a thorough evaluation of its behavior\nin both toy scenarios to assess the optimizer and complex networks to assess\nits potential. For this, we conduct large-scale simulation studies and compare\nPredicTor to existing congestion control mechanisms in Tor. We show that\nPredicTor is highly effective in reducing latency and realizing fair rate\nallocations.

    "title": "Learning Domain Invariant Prompt for Vision-Language Models",
    "abstract": "Prompt learning is one of the most effective and trending ways to adapt\npowerful vision-language foundation models like CLIP to downstream datasets by\ntuning learnable prompt vectors with very few samples. However, although prompt\nlearning achieves excellent performance over in-domain data, it still faces the\nmajor challenge of generalizing to unseen classes and domains. Some existing\nprompt learning methods tackle this issue by adaptively generating different\nprompts for different tokens or domains but neglecting the ability of learned\nprompts to generalize to unseen domains. In this paper, we propose a novel\nprompt learning paradigm that directly generates domain invariant prompt\ngeneralizable to unseen domains, called MetaPrompt. Specifically, a\ndual-modality prompt tuning network is proposed to generate prompts for inputs\nfrom both image and text modalities. More importantly, we propose a\nmeta-learning-based prompt tuning algorithm that explicitly constrains the\nprompt tuned on a specific domain or class also to achieve good performance on\nanother domain or class. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets for base-to-new\ngeneralization and four datasets for domain generalization demonstrate that our\nmethod consistently and significantly outperforms existing methods.",

In this paper, we propose HyperEnclave, an open and\ncross-platform process-based TEE that relies on the widely-available\nvirtualization extension to create the isolated execution environment. In\nparticular, HyperEnclave is designed to support the flexible enclave operation\nmodes to fulfill the security and performance demands under various enclave\nworkloads. We provide the enclave SDK to run existing SGX programs on\nHyperEnclave with little or no source code changes. We have implemented\nHyperEnclave on commodity AMD servers and deployed the system in a\nworld-leading FinTech company to support real-world privacy-preserving\ncomputations. The evaluation on both micro-benchmarks and application\nbenchmarks shows the design of HyperEnclave introduces only a small overhead.",

    "abstract": "Most of the existing signcryption schemes generate pseudonym by key\ngeneration center (KGC) and usually choose bilinear pairing to construct\nauthentication schemes. The drawback is that these schemes not only consume\nheavy computation and communication costs during information exchange, but also\ncan not eliminate security risks due to not updating pseudonym, which do not\nwork well for resource-constrained smart terminals in cyber-physical power\nsystems (CPPSs). The main objective of this paper is to propose a novel\nefficient signcryption scheme for resource-constrained smart terminals. First,\na dynamical pseudonym self-generation mechanism (DPSGM) is explored to achieve\nprivacy preservation and avoid the source being linked. Second, combined with\nDPSGM, an efficient signcryption scheme based on certificateless cryptography\n(CLC) and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is designed, which reduces\nimportantly computation and communication burden. Furthermore, under random\noracle model (ROM), the confidentiality and non-repudiation of the proposed\nsigncryption scheme are transformed into elliptic curve discrete logarithm and\ncomputational Diffie-Hellman problems that cannot be solved in polynomial time,\nwhich guarantees the security. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of\nthe proposed signcryption scheme are confirmed by experimental analyses.",

    "abstract": "Verification of properties expressed as $\\omega$-regular languages such as\nLTL can benefit hugely from stutter insensitivity, using a diverse set of\nreduction strategies. However properties that are not stutter invariant, for\ninstance due to the use of the neXt operator of LTL or to some form of counting\nin the logic, are not covered by these techniques in general. We propose in\nthis paper to study a weaker property than stutter insensitivity. In a stutter\ninsensitive language both adding and removing stutter to a word does not change\nits acceptance, any stuttering can be abstracted away; by decomposing this\nequivalence relation into two implications we obtain weaker conditions. We\ndefine a shortening insensitive language where any word that stutters less than\na word in the language must also belong to the language. A lengthening\ninsensitive language has the dual property. A semi-decision procedure is then\nintroduced to reliably prove shortening insensitive properties or deny\nlengthening insensitive properties while working with a \\emph{reduction} of a\nsystem. A reduction has the property that it can only shorten runs. Lipton's\ntransaction reductions or Petri net agglomerations are examples of eligible\nstructural reduction strategies. We also present an approach that can reason\nusing a partition of a property language into its stutter insensitive,\nshortening insensitive, lengthening insensitive and length sensitive parts to\nstill use structural reductions even when working with arbitrary properties.

In practice, the ground plane is dynamically\nchanged due to braking and unstable road surface. As a result, the vehicle\npose, especially the pitch angle, is oscillating from subtle to obvious. Thus,\nestimating ground plane normal is meaningful since it can be encoded to improve\nthe robustness of various autonomous driving tasks (e.g., 3D object detection,\nroad surface reconstruction, and trajectory planning). Our proposed method only\nuses odometry as input and estimates accurate ground plane normal vectors in\nreal time.

Built on that,\nan Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) is designed to estimate the normal\nvector in the sensor's coordinate. Thus, our proposed method is simple yet\nefficient and supports both camera- and inertial-based odometry algorithms. Its\nusability and the marked improvement of robustness are validated through\nmultiple experiments on public datasets.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised source-free domain adaptation methods aim to train a model to be\nused in the target domain utilizing the pretrained source-domain model and\nunlabeled target-domain data, where the source data may not be accessible due\nto intellectual property or privacy issues. These methods frequently utilize\nself-training with pseudo-labeling thresholded by prediction confidence. In a\nsource-free scenario, only supervision comes from target data, and thresholding\nlimits the contribution of the self-training. In this study, we utilize\nself-training with a mean-teacher approach. The student network is trained with\nall predictions of the teacher network. Instead of thresholding the\npredictions, the gradients calculated from the pseudo-labels are weighted based\non the reliability of the teacher's predictions. We propose a novel method that\nuses proxy-based metric learning to estimate reliability. We train a metric\nnetwork on the encoder features of the teacher network. Since the teacher is\nupdated with the moving average, the encoder feature space is slowly changing.\nTherefore, the metric network can be updated in training time, which enables\nend-to-end training. We also propose a metric-based online ClassMix method to\naugment the input of the student network where the patches to be mixed are\ndecided based on the metric reliability. We evaluated our method in\nsynthetic-to-real and cross-city scenarios. The benchmarks show that our method\nsignificantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "The paradigm shift of enabling extensive intercommunication between the\nOperational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) devices allows\nvulnerabilities typical to the IT world to propagate to the OT side. Therefore,\nthe security layer offered in the past by air gapping is removed, making\nsecurity patching for OT devices a hard requirement. Conventional patching\ninvolves a device reboot to load the patched code in the main memory, which\ndoes not apply to OT devices controlling critical processes due to downtime,\nnecessitating in-memory vulnerability patching. Furthermore, these control\nbinaries are often compiled by in-house proprietary compilers, further\nhindering the patching process and placing reliance on OT vendors for rapid\nvulnerability discovery and patch development. The current state-of-the-art\nhotpatching approaches only focus on firmware and/or RTOS. Therefore, in this\nwork, we develop ICSPatch, a framework to automate control logic vulnerability\nlocalization using Data Dependence Graphs (DDGs). With the help of DDGs,\nICSPatch pinpoints the vulnerability in the control application. As an\nindependent second step, ICSPatch can non-intrusively hotpatch vulnerabilities\nin the control application directly in the main memory of Programmable Logic\nControllers while maintaining reliable continuous operation. To evaluate our\nframework, we test ICSPatch on a synthetic dataset of 24 vulnerable control\napplication binaries from diverse critical infrastructure sectors. Results show\nthat ICSPatch could successfully localize all vulnerabilities and generate\npatches accordingly. Furthermore, the patch added negligible latency increase\nin the execution cycle while maintaining correctness and protection against the\nvulnerability.",

While current models offer\nimpressive performance on task accuracy and explanation plausibility, they\nsuffer from a range of issues: Some models feature a modular design where the\nexplanation generation module is poorly integrated with a separate module for\ntask-answer prediction, employ backbone models trained on limited sets of\ntasks, or incorporate ad hoc solutions to increase performance on single\ndatasets. We propose to evade these limitations by applying recent advances in\nlarge-scale multi-task pretraining of generative Transformer models to the\nproblem of VL-NLE tasks.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we show the surprisingly good properties of plain vision\ntransformers for body pose estimation from various aspects, namely simplicity\nin model structure, scalability in model size, flexibility in training\nparadigm, and transferability of knowledge between models, through a simple\nbaseline model dubbed ViTPose. Specifically, ViTPose employs the plain and\nnon-hierarchical vision transformer as an encoder to encode features and a\nlightweight decoder to decode body keypoints in either a top-down or a\nbottom-up manner. It can be scaled up from about 20M to 1B parameters by taking\nadvantage of the scalable model capacity and high parallelism of the vision\ntransformer, setting a new Pareto front for throughput and performance.\nBesides, ViTPose is very flexible regarding the attention type, input\nresolution, and pre-training and fine-tuning strategy. Based on the\nflexibility, a novel ViTPose+ model is proposed to deal with heterogeneous body\nkeypoint categories in different types of body pose estimation tasks via\nknowledge factorization, i.e., adopting task-agnostic and task-specific\nfeed-forward networks in the transformer. We also empirically demonstrate that\nthe knowledge of large ViTPose models can be easily transferred to small ones\nvia a simple knowledge token. Experimental results show that our ViTPose model\noutperforms representative methods on the challenging MS COCO Human Keypoint\nDetection benchmark at both top-down and bottom-up settings.

Unlike prior works that require\nadditional driving sources for controlled synthesis in a deterministic manner,\nwe instead probabilistically sample all the holistic lip-irrelevant facial\nmotions (i.e. pose, expression, blink, gaze, etc.) to semantically match the\ninput audio while still maintaining both the photo-realism of audio-lip\nsynchronization and the overall naturalness. This is achieved by our newly\nproposed audio-to-visual diffusion prior trained on top of the mapping between\naudio and disentangled non-lip facial representations. Thanks to the\nprobabilistic nature of the diffusion prior, one big advantage of our framework\nis it can synthesize diverse facial motion sequences given the same audio clip,\nwhich is quite user-friendly for many real applications. Through comprehensive\nevaluations on public benchmarks, we conclude that (1) our diffusion prior\noutperforms auto-regressive prior significantly on almost all the concerned\nmetrics; (2) our overall system is competitive with prior works in terms of\naudio-lip synchronization but can effectively sample rich and natural-looking\nlip-irrelevant facial motions while still semantically harmonized with the\naudio input.",

In this paper, we propose a fast\nsolution named Fast-BNS on multi-core CPUs to enhance the efficiency of the BN\nstructure learning. Fast-BNS is powered by a series of efficiency optimizations\nincluding (i) designing a dynamic work pool to monitor the processing of edges\nand to better schedule the workloads among threads, (ii) grouping the CI tests\nof the edges with the same endpoints to reduce the number of unnecessary CI\ntests, (iii) using a cache-friendly data storage to improve the memory\nefficiency, and (iv) generating the conditioning sets on-the-fly to avoid extra\nmemory consumption. A comprehensive experimental study shows that the\nsequential version of Fast-BNS is up to 50 times faster than its counterpart,\nand the parallel version of Fast-BNS achieves 4.8 to 24.5 times speedup over\nthe state-of-the-art multi-threaded solution.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel transfer learning method for NMT, namely ConsistTL,\nwhich can continuously transfer knowledge from the parent model during the\ntraining of the child model.

Experimental results on five\nlow-resource NMT tasks demonstrate that ConsistTL results in significant\nimprovements over strong transfer learning baselines, with a gain up to 1.7\nBLEU over the existing back-translation model on the widely-used WMT17\nTurkish-English benchmark.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) and Foundation models have been the go-to\nrecipe for achieving SoTA performance on general benchmarks. However,\nleveraging these powerful techniques for more complex vision-language tasks,\nsuch as cooking applications, with more structured input data, is still little\ninvestigated. In this work, we propose to leverage these techniques for\nstructured-text based computational cuisine tasks. Our strategy, dubbed VLPCook\n(Structured Vision-Language Pretraining for Computational Cooking), first\ntransforms existing image-text pairs to image and structured-text pairs. This\nallows to pretrain our VLPCook model using VLP objectives adapted to the\nstrutured data of the resulting datasets, then finetuning it on downstream\ncomputational cooking tasks. During finetuning, we also enrich the visual\nencoder, leveraging pretrained foundation models (e.g. CLIP) to provide local\nand global textual context. VLPCook outperforms current SoTA by a significant\nmargin (+3.3 Recall@1 absolute improvement) on the task of Cross-Modal Food\nRetrieval on the large Recipe1M dataset. Finally, we conduct further\nexperiments on VLP to validate their importance, especially on the Recipe1M+\ndataset. The code will be made publicly available.",

However, human-driven verification\nleads to a time-consuming task and a bottleneck to have checked trustworthy\ninformation at the same pace they emerge. Since misinformation relates not only\nto the content itself but also to other social features, this paper addresses\nautomatic misinformation checking in social networks from a multimodal\nperspective. Moreover, as simply naming a piece of news as incorrect may not\nconvince the citizen and, even worse, strengthen confirmation bias, the\nproposal is a modality-level explainable-prone misinformation classifier\nframework. Our framework comprises a misinformation classifier assisted by\nexplainable methods to generate modality-oriented explainable inferences.\nPreliminary findings show that the misinformation classifier does benefit from\nmultimodal information encoding and the modality-oriented explainable mechanism\nincreases both inferences' interpretability and completeness.",

Our comparison between MP and INLP shows that (1) one MP\nprojection removes linear separability based on the target and (2) MP has less\nimpact on the overall space. Further analysis shows that applying random\nprojections after MP leads to the same overall effects on the embedding space\nas the multiple projections of INLP.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the great success of self-supervised learning\n(SSL) in recommendation systems. However, SSL recommender models are likely to\nsuffer from spurious correlations, leading to poor generalization. To mitigate\nspurious correlations, existing work usually pursues ID-based SSL\nrecommendation or utilizes feature engineering to identify spurious features.\nNevertheless, ID-based SSL approaches sacrifice the positive impact of\ninvariant features, while feature engineering methods require high-cost human\nlabeling. To address the problems, we aim to automatically mitigate the effect\nof spurious correlations. This objective requires to 1) automatically mask\nspurious features without supervision, and 2) block the negative effect\ntransmission from spurious features to other features during SSL. To handle the\ntwo challenges, we propose an invariant feature learning framework, which first\ndivides user-item interactions into multiple environments with distribution\nshifts and then learns a feature mask mechanism to capture invariant features\nacross environments. Based on the mask mechanism, we can remove the spurious\nfeatures for robust predictions and block the negative effect transmission via\nmask-guided feature augmentation. Extensive experiments on two datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in mitigating spurious\ncorrelations and improving the generalization abilities of SSL models.",

    "abstract": "The biconjugate gradient method (BiCG) is one of the most popular short-term\nrecurrence methods for solving non-symmetric linear systems of equations. The\nobjective of this paper is to provide an efficient adaption of BiCG to\nparameterized linear systems. More precisely, we consider the problem of\napproximating the solution to $A(\\mu) x(\\mu) = b$ for many different values of\nthe parameter $\\mu$. Here we assume $A(\\mu)$ is large, sparse, and nonsingular\nwith a nonlinear dependence on $\\mu$. Our method is based on a companion\nlinearization derived from an accurate Chebyshev interpolation of $A(\\mu)$ on\nthe interval $[-a,a]$, $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The solution to the linearization is\napproximated in a preconditioned BiCG setting for shifted systems, where the\nKrylov basis matrix is formed once. This process leads to a short-term\nrecurrence method, where one execution of the algorithm produces the\napproximation to $x(\\mu)$ for many different values of the parameter $\\mu \\in\n[-a,a]$ simultaneously. In particular, this work proposes one algorithm which\napplies a shift-and-invert preconditioner exactly as well as an algorithm which\napplies the same preconditioner inexactly. The competitiveness of the\nalgorithms are illustrated with large-scale problems arising from a finite\nelement discretization of a Helmholtz equation with parameterized material\ncoefficient.

However, the real-time control with it is a big challenge due\nto its unstable updates and poor convergence. This paper tackles this challenge\nwith a novel derivation from reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, which has a\nmode-seeking behavior and is likely to find one of the sub-optimal solutions\nearly. With this derivation, a weighted maximum likelihood estimation with\npositive/negative weights is obtained, solving by mirror descent (MD)\nalgorithm. While the negative weights eliminate unnecessary actions, that\nrequires to develop a practical implementation that avoids the interference\nwith positive/negative updates based on rejection sampling. In addition,\nalthough the convergence of MD can be accelerated with Nesterov's acceleration\nmethod, it is modified for the proposed MPC with a heuristic of a step size\nadaptive to the noise estimated in update amounts. In the real-time\nsimulations, the proposed method can solve more tasks statistically than the\nconventional method and accomplish more complex tasks only with a CPU due to\nthe improved acceleration.

To avoid catastrophic forgetting, various continual\nlearning (CL) approaches have been devised. However, these usually require\ndiscrete task boundaries. This requirement seems biologically implausible and\noften limits the application of CL methods in the real world where tasks are\nnot always well defined. Here, we take inspiration from neuroscience, where\nsparse, non-overlapping neuronal representations have been suggested to prevent\ncatastrophic forgetting. As in the brain, we argue that these sparse\nrepresentations should be chosen on the basis of feed forward\n(stimulus-specific) as well as top-down (context-specific) information. To\nimplement such selective sparsity, we use a bio-plausible form of hierarchical\ncredit assignment known as Deep Feedback Control (DFC) and combine it with a\nwinner-take-all sparsity mechanism. In addition to sparsity, we introduce\nlateral recurrent connections within each layer to further protect previously\nlearned representations. We evaluate the new sparse-recurrent version of DFC on\nthe split-MNIST computer vision benchmark and show that only the combination of\nsparsity and intra-layer recurrent connections improves CL performance with\nrespect to standard backpropagation. Our method achieves similar performance to\nwell-known CL methods, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation and Synaptic\nIntelligence, without requiring information about task boundaries.

We focus primarily on the\nimplications for designing neuromorphic circuits that communicate with the\nbrain, as in this case it is essential that artificial and biological neurons\nuse compatible neural codes. However, we also discuss implications for the\ndesign of neuromorphic systems for implementation or emulation of neural\ncomputation.",

    "abstract": "The fifth generation of the Radio Access Network (RAN) has brought new\nservices, technologies, and paradigms with the corresponding societal benefits.\nHowever, the energy consumption of 5G networks is today a concern. In recent\nyears, the design of new methods for decreasing the RAN power consumption has\nattracted interest from both the research community and standardization bodies,\nand many energy savings solutions have been proposed. However, there is still a\nneed to understand the power consumption behavior of state-ofthe-art base\nstation architectures, such as multi-carrier active antenna units (AAUs), as\nwell as the impact of different network parameters. In this paper, we present a\npower consumption model for 5G AAUs based on artificial neural networks. We\ndemonstrate that this model achieves good estimation performance, and it is\nable to capture the benefits of energy saving when dealing with the complexity\nof multi-carrier base stations architectures. Importantly, multiple experiments\nare carried out to show the advantage of designing a general model able to\ncapture the power consumption behaviors of different types of AAUs. Finally, we\nprovide an analysis of the model scalability and the training data\nrequirements.",

    "abstract": "Conditional normalizing flows can generate diverse image samples for solving\ninverse problems. Most normalizing flows for inverse problems in imaging employ\nthe conditional affine coupling layer that can generate diverse images quickly.\nHowever, unintended severe artifacts are occasionally observed in the output of\nthem. In this work, we address this critical issue by investigating the origins\nof these artifacts and proposing the conditions to avoid them. First of all, we\nempirically and theoretically reveal that these problems are caused by\n``exploding variance'' in the conditional affine coupling layer for certain\nout-of-distribution (OOD) conditional inputs. Then, we further validated that\nthe probability of causing erroneous artifacts in pixels is highly correlated\nwith a Mahalanobis distance-based OOD score for inverse problems in imaging.\nLastly, based on our investigations, we propose a remark to avoid exploding\nvariance and then based on it, we suggest a simple remedy that substitutes the\naffine coupling layers with the modified rational quadratic spline coupling\nlayers in normalizing flows, to encourage the robustness of generated image\nsamples. Our experimental results demonstrated that our suggested methods\neffectively suppressed critical artifacts occurring in normalizing flows for\nsuper-resolution space generation and low-light image enhancement without\ncompromising performance.",

An AD environment naturally describes an attack graph where\nnodes represent computers/accounts/security groups, and edges represent\nexisting accesses/known exploits that allow the attacker to gain access from\none node to another. Motivated by practical AD use cases, we study a\nStackelberg game between one attacker and one defender. There are multiple\nentry nodes for the attacker to choose from and there is a single target\n(Domain Admin). Every edge has a failure rate. The attacker chooses the attack\npath with the maximum success rate. The defender can block a limited number of\nedges (i.e., revoke accesses) from a set of blockable edges, limited by budget.\nThe defender's aim is to minimize the attacker's success rate.\nWe exploit the tree-likeness of practical AD graphs to design scalable\nalgorithms. We propose two novel methods that combine theoretical fixed\nparameter analysis and practical optimisation techniques.\nFor graphs with small tree widths, we propose a tree decomposition based\ndynamic program. We then propose a general method for converting tree\ndecomposition based dynamic programs to reinforcement learning environments,\nwhich leads to an anytime algorithm that scales better, but loses the\noptimality guarantee.\nFor graphs with small numbers of non-splitting paths (a parameter we invent\nspecifically for AD graphs), we propose a kernelization technique that\nsignificantly downsizes the model, which is then solved via mixed-integer\nprogramming.\nExperimentally, our algorithms scale to handle synthetic AD graphs with tens\nof thousands of nodes.",

    "abstract": "One of the weaknesses of classical (fuzzy) rough sets is their sensitivity to\nnoise, which is particularly undesirable for machine learning applications. One\napproach to solve this issue is by making use of fuzzy quantifiers, as done by\nthe vaguely quantified fuzzy rough set (VQFRS) model. While this idea is\nintuitive, the VQFRS model suffers from both theoretical flaws as well as from\nsuboptimal performance in applications. In this paper, we improve on VQFRS by\nintroducing fuzzy quantifier-based fuzzy rough sets (FQFRS), an intuitive\ngeneralization of fuzzy rough sets that makes use of general unary and binary\nquantification models. We show how several existing models fit in this\ngeneralization as well as how it inspires novel ones. Several binary\nquantification models are proposed to be used with FQFRS. We conduct a\ntheoretical study of their properties, and investigate their potential by\napplying them to classification problems. In particular, we highlight Yager's\nWeighted Implication-based (YWI) binary quantification model, which induces a\nfuzzy rough set model that is both a significant improvement on VQFRS, as well\nas a worthy competitor to the popular ordered weighted averaging based fuzzy\nrough set (OWAFRS) model.",

A key element of\nreliable optimization for these systems is the modification of the loss\nfunction. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) modifies the underlying loss\nfunction to guide descent methods towards flatter minima, which arguably have\nbetter generalization abilities. In this paper, we focus on a variant of SAM\nknown as mSAM, which, during training, averages the updates generated by\nadversarial perturbations across several disjoint shards of a mini-batch.\nRecent work suggests that mSAM can outperform SAM in terms of test accuracy.\nHowever, a comprehensive empirical study of mSAM is missing from the literature\n-- previous results have mostly been limited to specific architectures and\ndatasets. To that end, this paper presents a thorough empirical evaluation of\nmSAM on various tasks and datasets. We provide a flexible implementation of\nmSAM and compare the generalization performance of mSAM to the performance of\nSAM and vanilla training on different image classification and natural language\nprocessing tasks. We also conduct careful experiments to understand the\ncomputational cost of training with mSAM, its sensitivity to hyperparameters\nand its correlation with the flatness of the loss landscape.

    "abstract": "Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) can deliver higher density and lower cost per bit\nwhen compared with DRAM. Its main drawback is that it is slower than DRAM. On\nthe other hand, DRAM has scalability problems due to its cost and energy\nconsumption. NVM will likely coexist with DRAM in computer systems and the\nbiggest challenge is to know which data to allocate on each type of memory. A\nstate-of-the-art approach is AutoNUMA, in the Linux kernel. Prior work is\nlimited to measuring AutoNUMA solely in terms of the application execution\ntime, without understanding AutoNUMA's behavior. In this work we provide a more\nin-depth characterization of AutoNUMA, for instance, identifying where exactly\na set of pages are allocated, while keeping track of promotion and demotion\ndecisions performed by AutoNUMA. Our analysis shows that AutoNUMA's benefits\ncan be modest when running graph processing applications, or graph analytics,\nbecause most pages have only one access over the entire execution time and\nother pages accesses have no temporal locality. We make a case for exploring\napplication characteristics using object-level mappings between DRAM and NVM.\nOur preliminary experiments show that an object-level memory tiering can better\ncapture the application behavior and reduce the execution time of graph\nanalytics by 21% (avg) and 51% (max), when compared to AutoNUMA, while\nsignificantly reducing the number of memory accesses in NVM.",

This system dynamically adjusts the distance between\nthe finger bases in response to object behavior. Compared to fixed finger\nbases, this technique significantly increases the area of the object that is\nexposed to finger-mounted tactile arrays during a single rolling motion (an\nincrease of over 60% was observed for a cylinder with a 30-millimeter\ndiameter). In addition, this paper presents a feature extraction algorithm for\nthe collected spatiotemporal dataset, which focuses on object corner\nidentification, analysis, and compact representation. This technique\ndrastically reduces the dimensionality of each data sample from 10 x 1500 time\nseries data to 80 features, which was further reduced by Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) to 22 components.

In\nthis paper, a device fingerprinting (DFP) method has been proposed for device\nidentification, based on digital footprints, which devices use for\ncommunication over a network. A subset of nine features have been selected from\nthe network and transport layers of a single transmission control\nprotocol/internet protocol packet based on attribute evaluators in Weka, to\ngenerate device-specific signatures. The method has been evaluated on two\nonline datasets, and an experimental dataset, using different supervised\nmachine learning (ML) algorithms. Results have shown that the method is able to\ndistinguish device type with up to 100% precision using the random forest (RF)\nclassifier, and classify individual devices with up to 95.7% precision. These\nresults demonstrate the applicability of the proposed DFP method for device\nidentification, in order to provide a more secure and robust network.",

Such motions can come from\narchival motion capture or from IMU sensors worn on the body, effectively\nturning human movement in a \"scanner\" of the 3D world. Intuitively, human\nmovement indicates the free-space in a room and human contact indicates\nsurfaces or objects that support activities such as sitting, lying or touching.\nWe propose MIME (Mining Interaction and Movement to infer 3D Environments),\nwhich is a generative model of indoor scenes that produces furniture layouts\nthat are consistent with the human movement. MIME uses an auto-regressive\ntransformer architecture that takes the already generated objects in the scene\nas well as the human motion as input, and outputs the next plausible object.

    "abstract": "Learning continuous image representations is recently gaining popularity for\nimage super-resolution (SR) because of its ability to reconstruct\nhigh-resolution images with arbitrary scales from low-resolution inputs.\nExisting methods mostly ensemble nearby features to predict the new pixel at\nany queried coordinate in the SR image. Such a local ensemble suffers from some\nlimitations: i) it has no learnable parameters and it neglects the similarity\nof the visual features; ii) it has a limited receptive field and cannot\nensemble relevant features in a large field which are important in an image;\niii) it inherently has a gap with real camera imaging since it only depends on\nthe coordinate. To address these issues, this paper proposes a continuous\nimplicit attention-in-attention network, called CiaoSR. We explicitly design an\nimplicit attention network to learn the ensemble weights for the nearby local\nfeatures. Furthermore, we embed a scale-aware attention in this implicit\nattention network to exploit additional non-local information. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate CiaoSR significantly outperforms\nthe existing single image super resolution (SISR) methods with the same\nbackbone. In addition, the proposed method also achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance on the arbitrary-scale SR task. The effectiveness of the method is\nalso demonstrated on the real-world SR setting.

    "abstract": "In recent years, using a self-supervised learning framework to learn the\ngeneral characteristics of graphs has been considered a promising paradigm for\ngraph representation learning. The core of self-supervised learning strategies\nfor graph neural networks lies in constructing suitable positive sample\nselection strategies. However, existing GNNs typically aggregate information\nfrom neighboring nodes to update node representations, leading to an\nover-reliance on neighboring positive samples, i.e., homophilous samples; while\nignoring long-range positive samples, i.e., positive samples that are far apart\non the graph but structurally equivalent samples, a problem we call \"neighbor\nbias.\" This neighbor bias can reduce the generalization performance of GNNs. In\nthis paper, we argue that the generalization properties of GNNs should be\ndetermined by combining homogeneous samples and structurally equivalent\nsamples, which we call the \"GC combination hypothesis.\" Therefore, we propose a\ntopological signal-driven self-supervised method. It uses a topological\ninformation-guided structural equivalence sampling strategy. First, we extract\nmultiscale topological features using persistent homology. Then we compute the\nstructural equivalence of node pairs based on their topological features. In\nparticular, we design a topological loss function to pull in non-neighboring\nnode pairs with high structural equivalence in the representation space to\nalleviate neighbor bias. Finally, we use the joint training mechanism to adjust\nthe effect of structural equivalence on the model to fit datasets with\ndifferent characteristics. We conducted experiments on the node classification\ntask across seven graph datasets. The results show that the model performance\ncan be effectively improved using a strategy of topological signal enhancement.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have strong capabilities of memorizing the underlying\ntraining data, which can be a serious privacy concern. An effective solution to\nthis problem is to train models with differential privacy, which provides\nrigorous privacy guarantees by injecting random noise to the gradients. This\npaper focuses on the scenario where sensitive data are distributed among\nmultiple participants, who jointly train a model through federated learning\n(FL), using both secure multiparty computation (MPC) to ensure the\nconfidentiality of each gradient update, and differential privacy to avoid data\nleakage in the resulting model. A major challenge in this setting is that\ncommon mechanisms for enforcing DP in deep learning, which inject real-valued\nnoise, are fundamentally incompatible with MPC, which exchanges finite-field\nintegers among the participants. Consequently, most existing DP mechanisms\nrequire rather high noise levels, leading to poor model utility. Motivated by\nthis, we propose Skellam mixture mechanism (SMM), an approach to enforce DP on\nmodels built via FL. Compared to existing methods, SMM eliminates the\nassumption that the input gradients must be integer-valued, and, thus, reduces\nthe amount of noise injected to preserve DP. Further, SMM allows tight privacy\naccounting due to the nice composition and sub-sampling properties of the\nSkellam distribution, which are key to accurate deep learning with DP. The\ntheoretical analysis of SMM is highly non-trivial, especially considering (i)\nthe complicated math of differentially private deep learning in general and\n(ii) the fact that the mixture of two Skellam distributions is rather complex,\nand to our knowledge, has not been studied in the DP literature. Extensive\nexperiments on various practical settings demonstrate that SMM consistently and\nsignificantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of the utility of the\nresulting model.",

    "abstract": "As the bridge between users and software, Graphical User Interface (GUI) is\ncritical to the app accessibility. Scaling up the font or display size of GUI\ncan help improve the visual impact, readability, and usability of an app, and\nis frequently used by the elderly and people with vision impairment. Yet this\ncan easily lead to scaling issues such as text truncation, component overlap,\nwhich negatively influence the acquirement of the right information and the\nfluent usage of the app. Previous techniques for UI display issue detection and\ncross-platform inconsistency detection cannot work well for these scaling\nissues. In this paper, we propose an automated method, dVermin, for scaling\nissue detection, through detecting the inconsistency of a view under the\ndefault and a larger display scale. The evaluation result shows that dVermin\nachieves 97% precision and 97% recall in issue page detection, and 84%\nprecision and 91% recall for issue view detection, outperforming two\nstate-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.

This problem carries significant importance for analyzing models of\ndiscrete spacetime in quantum gravity; inferring network geometry in network\nscience; and manifold learning in data science. The key contribution of this\npaper is to introduce and validate a new estimator of discrete sectional\ncurvature for random graphs with low metric-distortion. The latter are\nconstructed via a specific graph sprinkling method on different manifolds with\nconstant sectional curvature. We define a notion of metric distortion, which\nquantifies how well the graph metric approximates the metric of the underlying\nmanifold. We show how graph sprinkling algorithms can be refined to produce\nhard annulus random geometric graphs with minimal metric distortion. We\nconstruct random geometric graphs for spheres, hyperbolic and euclidean planes;\nupon which we validate our curvature estimator. Numerical analysis reveals that\nthe error of the estimated curvature diminishes as the mean metric distortion\ngoes to zero, thus demonstrating convergence of the estimate. We also perform\ncomparisons to other existing discrete curvature measures. Finally, we\ndemonstrate two practical applications: (i) estimation of the earth's radius\nusing geographical data; and (ii) sectional curvature distributions of\nself-similar fractals.",

    "abstract": "In classic reinforcement learning algorithms, agents make decisions at\ndiscrete and fixed time intervals. The physical duration between one decision\nand the next becomes a critical hyperparameter. When this duration is too\nshort, the agent needs to make many decisions to achieve its goal, aggravating\nthe problem's difficulty. But when this duration is too long, the agent becomes\nincapable of controlling the system. Physical systems, however, do not need a\nconstant control frequency. For learning agents, it is desirable to operate\nwith low frequency when possible and high frequency when necessary. We propose\na framework called Continuous-Time Continuous-Options (CTCO), where the agent\nchooses options as sub-policies of variable durations. Such options are\ntime-continuous and can interact with the system at any desired frequency\nproviding a smooth change of actions. The empirical analysis shows that our\nalgorithm is competitive w.r.t. other time-abstraction techniques, such as\nclassic option learning and action repetition, and practically overcomes the\ndifficult choice of the decision frequency.",

To empower multi-modal task-scaling and speed up this line of\nresearch, we release a generalist model learning system, OFASys, built on top\nof a declarative task interface named multi-modal instruction. At the core of\nOFASys is the idea of decoupling multi-modal task representations from the\nunderlying model implementations. In OFASys, a task involving multiple\nmodalities can be defined declaratively even with just a single line of code.\nThe system automatically generates task plans from such instructions for\ntraining and inference. It also facilitates multi-task training for diverse\nmulti-modal workloads. As a starting point, we provide presets of 7 different\nmodalities and 23 highly-diverse example tasks in OFASys, with which we also\ndevelop a first-in-kind, single model, OFA+, that can handle text, image,\nspeech, video, and motion data. The single OFA+ model achieves 95% performance\nin average with only 16% parameters of 15 task-finetuned models, showcasing the\nperformance reliability of multi-modal task-scaling provided by OFASys.\nAvailable at https://github.com/OFA-Sys/OFASys",

    "abstract": "Mathematical models are essential for understanding and making predictions\nabout systems arising in nature and engineering. Yet, mathematical models are a\nsimplification of true phenomena, thus making predictions subject to\nuncertainty. Hence, the ability to quantify uncertainties is essential to any\nmodelling framework, enabling the user to assess the importance of certain\nparameters on quantities of interest and have control over the quality of the\nmodel output by providing a rigorous understanding of uncertainty. Peridynamic\nmodels are a particular class of mathematical models that have proven to be\nremarkably accurate and robust for a large class of material failure problems.\nHowever, the high computational expense of peridynamic models remains a major\nlimitation, hindering outer-loop applications that require a large number of\nsimulations, for example, uncertainty quantification. This contribution\nprovides a framework to make such computations feasible. By employing a\nMultilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) framework, where the majority of simulations are\nperformed using a coarse mesh, and performing relatively few simulations using\na fine mesh, a significant reduction in computational cost can be realised, and\nstatistics of structural failure can be estimated. The results show a speed-up\nfactor of 16x over a standard Monte Carlo estimator, enabling the forward\npropagation of uncertain parameters in a computationally expensive peridynamic\nmodel. Furthermore, the multilevel method provides an estimate of both the\ndiscretisation error and sampling error, thus improving the confidence in\nnumerical predictions. The performance of the approach is demonstrated through\nan examination of the statistical size effect in quasi-brittle materials.",

Given a speech recording, we synthesize sequences of 3D body\nposes, hand gestures, and facial expressions that are realistic and diverse. To\nachieve this, we first build a high-quality dataset of 3D holistic body meshes\nwith synchronous speech. We then define a novel speech-to-motion generation\nframework in which the face, body, and hands are modeled separately. The\nseparated modeling stems from the fact that face articulation strongly\ncorrelates with human speech, while body poses and hand gestures are less\ncorrelated. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder for face motions, and a\ncompositional vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) for the body\nand hand motions. The compositional VQ-VAE is key to generating diverse\nresults.

Over the past decade, researchers\nhave developed many different kinds of lenses with different properties. One\nclass of such languages operate over regular languages. In other words, these\nlenses convert strings drawn from one regular language to strings drawn from\nanother regular language (and back again). In this paper, we define a more\npowerful language of lenses, which we call match-reference lenses, that is\ncapable of translating between non-regular formats that contain repeated\nsubstrings, which is a primitive form of dependency. To define the non-regular\nformats themselves, we develop a new language, match-reference regular\nexpressions, which are regular expressions that can bind variables to\nsubstrings and use those substrings repeatedly. These match-reference regular\nexpressions are closely related to the familiar ``back-references\" that can be\nfound in traditional regular expression packages, but are redesigned to adhere\nto conventional programming language lexical scoping conventions and to\ninteract smoothly with lens language infrastructure. We define the semantics of\nmatch-reference regular expressions and match-reference lenses.

We develop\nthree variations on VAEs by introducing a second parameterized encoder/decoder\npair and, for one variation, an additional fixed encoder. The parameters of the\nencoders/decoders are to be learned with a neural network. The fixed encoder is\nobtained by probabilistic-PCA. The variations are compared to the Evidence\nLower Bound (ELBO) approximation to the original VAE.

    "abstract": "Recent development in the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)\nhas helped improve trust in Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) systems, in\nwhich an explanation is provided together with the model prediction in response\nto each query. However, XAI also opens a door for adversaries to gain insights\ninto the black-box models in MLaaS, thereby making the models more vulnerable\nto several attacks. For example, feature-based explanations (e.g., SHAP) could\nexpose the top important features that a black-box model focuses on. Such\ndisclosure has been exploited to craft effective backdoor triggers against\nmalware classifiers. To address this trade-off, we introduce a new concept of\nachieving local differential privacy (LDP) in the explanations, and from that\nwe establish a defense, called XRand, against such attacks. We show that our\nmechanism restricts the information that the adversary can learn about the top\nimportant features, while maintaining the faithfulness of the explanations.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a physics-informed deep learning-based super-resolution\nframework to enhance the spatio-temporal resolution of the solution of\ntime-dependent partial differential equations (PDE). Prior works on deep\nlearning-based super-resolution models have shown promise in accelerating\nengineering design by reducing the computational expense of traditional\nnumerical schemes. However, these models heavily rely on the availability of\nhigh-resolution (HR) labeled data needed during training. In this work, we\npropose a physics-informed deep learning-based framework to enhance the spatial\nand temporal resolution of coarse-scale (both in space and time) PDE solutions\nwithout requiring any HR data. The framework consists of two trainable modules\nindependently super-resolving the PDE solution, first in spatial and then in\ntemporal direction. The physics based losses are implemented in a novel way to\nensure tight coupling between the spatio-temporally refined outputs at\ndifferent times and improve framework accuracy. We analyze the capability of\nthe developed framework by investigating its performance on an elastodynamics\nproblem. It is observed that the proposed framework can successfully\nsuper-resolve (both in space and time) the low-resolution PDE solutions while\nsatisfying physics-based constraints and yielding high accuracy. Furthermore,\nthe analysis and obtained speed-up show that the proposed framework is\nwell-suited for integration with traditional numerical methods to reduce\ncomputational complexity during engineering design.",

One\nparticularly ambitious goal of meta-learning is to train general-purpose\nin-context learning algorithms from scratch, using only black-box models with\nminimal inductive bias. Such a model takes in training data, and produces\ntest-set predictions across a wide range of problems, without any explicit\ndefinition of an inference model, training loss, or optimization algorithm. In\nthis paper we show that Transformers and other black-box models can be\nmeta-trained to act as general-purpose in-context learners. We characterize\nphase transitions between algorithms that generalize, algorithms that memorize,\nand algorithms that fail to meta-train at all, induced by changes in model\nsize, number of tasks, and meta-optimization. We further show that the\ncapabilities of meta-trained algorithms are bottlenecked by the accessible\nstate size (memory) determining the next prediction, unlike standard models\nwhich are thought to be bottlenecked by parameter count.

    "abstract": "Robust prediction of citywide traffic flows at different time periods plays a\ncrucial role in intelligent transportation systems. While previous work has\nmade great efforts to model spatio-temporal correlations, existing methods\nstill suffer from two key limitations: i) Most models collectively predict all\nregions' flows without accounting for spatial heterogeneity, i.e., different\nregions may have skewed traffic flow distributions. ii) These models fail to\ncapture the temporal heterogeneity induced by time-varying traffic patterns, as\nthey typically model temporal correlations with a shared parameterized space\nfor all time periods. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel\nSpatio-Temporal Self-Supervised Learning (ST-SSL) traffic prediction framework\nwhich enhances the traffic pattern representations to be reflective of both\nspatial and temporal heterogeneity, with auxiliary self-supervised learning\nparadigms. Specifically, our ST-SSL is built over an integrated module with\ntemporal and spatial convolutions for encoding the information across space and\ntime. To achieve the adaptive spatio-temporal self-supervised learning, our\nST-SSL first performs the adaptive augmentation over the traffic flow graph\ndata at both attribute- and structure-levels. On top of the augmented traffic\ngraph, two SSL auxiliary tasks are constructed to supplement the main traffic\nprediction task with spatial and temporal heterogeneity-aware augmentation.\nExperiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SSL consistently\noutperforms various state-of-the-art baselines. Since spatio-temporal\nheterogeneity widely exists in practical datasets, the proposed framework may\nalso cast light on other spatial-temporal applications.

Using\nexisting works on fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models with a single\nimage causes severe overfitting issues.

The utilization of digital services is\nincreasing more rapidly than any other segment of world trade. The availability\nof open data unlocks the possibility of generating market possibilities in the\npublic and private sectors. Digital service utilization can be improved by\nadopting cloud-based software services and open data innovation for service\ndevelopment. However, open data has no value unless utilized, and little is\nknown about developing digital services using open data. Evaluation of digital\nservice development processes to service deployment is indispensable. Despite\nthis, existing evaluation models are not specifically designed to measure open\ndata innovation contests. Additionally, existing cloud-based digital service\nimplications are not used directly to adopt the technology, and empirical\nresearch needs to be included. The research question addressed in this thesis\nis: \"How can contest-driven innovation of open data digital services be\nevaluated and the adoption of digital services be supported to improve the\nutilization of digital services?\" The research approaches used are design\nscience research, descriptive statistics, and case study.

    "abstract": "While object reconstruction has made great strides in recent years, current\nmethods typically require densely captured images and/or known camera poses,\nand generalize poorly to novel object categories. To step toward object\nreconstruction in the wild, this work explores reconstructing general\nreal-world objects from a few images without known camera poses or object\ncategories. The crux of our work is solving two fundamental 3D vision problems\n-- shape reconstruction and pose estimation -- in a unified approach. Our\napproach captures the synergies of these two problems: reliable camera pose\nestimation gives rise to accurate shape reconstruction, and the accurate\nreconstruction, in turn, induces robust correspondence between different views\nand facilitates pose estimation. Our method FORGE predicts 3D features from\neach view and leverages them in conjunction with the input images to establish\ncross-view correspondence for estimating relative camera poses. The 3D features\nare then transformed by the estimated poses into a shared space and are fused\ninto a neural radiance field.

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel framework built to simplify 3D asset\ngeneration for amateur users. To enable interactive generation, our method\nsupports a variety of input modalities that can be easily provided by a human,\nincluding images, text, partially observed shapes and combinations of these,\nfurther allowing to adjust the strength of each input. At the core of our\napproach is an encoder-decoder, compressing 3D shapes into a compact latent\nrepresentation, upon which a diffusion model is learned. To enable a variety of\nmulti-modal inputs, we employ task-specific encoders with dropout followed by a\ncross-attention mechanism. Due to its flexibility, our model naturally supports\na variety of tasks, outperforming prior works on shape completion, image-based\n3D reconstruction, and text-to-3D. Most interestingly, our model can combine\nall these tasks into one swiss-army-knife tool, enabling the user to perform\nshape generation using incomplete shapes, images, and textual descriptions at\nthe same time, providing the relative weights for each input and facilitating\ninteractivity. Despite our approach being shape-only, we further show an\nefficient method to texture the generated shape using large-scale text-to-image\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "Conventional methods for human motion synthesis are either deterministic or\nstruggle with the trade-off between motion diversity and motion quality. In\nresponse to these limitations, we introduce MoFusion, i.e., a new\ndenoising-diffusion-based framework for high-quality conditional human motion\nsynthesis that can generate long, temporally plausible, and semantically\naccurate motions based on a range of conditioning contexts (such as music and\ntext). We also present ways to introduce well-known kinematic losses for motion\nplausibility within the motion diffusion framework through our scheduled\nweighting strategy. The learned latent space can be used for several\ninteractive motion editing applications -- like inbetweening, seed\nconditioning, and text-based editing -- thus, providing crucial abilities for\nvirtual character animation and robotics.

    "abstract": "Owing to the success of transformer models, recent works study their\napplicability in 3D medical segmentation tasks. Within the transformer models,\nthe self-attention mechanism is one of the main building blocks that strives to\ncapture long-range dependencies, compared to the local convolutional-based\ndesign. However, the self-attention operation has quadratic complexity which\nproves to be a computational bottleneck, especially in volumetric medical\nimaging, where the inputs are 3D with numerous slices. In this paper, we\npropose a 3D medical image segmentation approach, named UNETR++, that offers\nboth high-quality segmentation masks as well as efficiency in terms of\nparameters and compute cost. The core of our design is the introduction of a\nnovel efficient paired attention (EPA) block that efficiently learns spatial\nand channel-wise discriminative features using a pair of inter-dependent\nbranches based on spatial and channel attention. Our spatial attention\nformulation is efficient having linear complexity with respect to the input\nsequence length. To enable communication between spatial and channel-focused\nbranches, we share the weights of query and key mapping functions that provide\na complimentary benefit (paired attention), while also reducing the overall\nnetwork parameters. Our extensive evaluations on three benchmarks, Synapse,\nBTCV and ACDC, reveal the effectiveness of the proposed contributions in terms\nof both efficiency and accuracy. On Synapse dataset, our UNETR++ sets a new\nstate-of-the-art with a Dice Similarity Score of 87.2%, while being\nsignificantly efficient with a reduction of over 71% in terms of both\nparameters and FLOPs, compared to the best existing method in the literature.\nCode: https://github.com/Amshaker/unetr_plus_plus.",

    "abstract": "Benefiting from masked visual modeling, self-supervised video representation\nlearning has achieved remarkable progress. However, existing methods focus on\nlearning representations from scratch through reconstructing low-level features\nlike raw pixel RGB values. In this paper, we propose masked video distillation\n(MVD), a simple yet effective two-stage masked feature modeling framework for\nvideo representation learning: firstly we pretrain an image (or video) model by\nrecovering low-level features of masked patches, then we use the resulting\nfeatures as targets for masked feature modeling. For the choice of teacher\nmodels, we observe that students taught by video teachers perform better on\ntemporally-heavy video tasks, while image teachers transfer stronger spatial\nrepresentations for spatially-heavy video tasks. Visualization analysis also\nindicates different teachers produce different learned patterns for students.\nMotivated by this observation, to leverage the advantage of different teachers,\nwe design a spatial-temporal co-teaching method for MVD. Specifically, we\ndistill student models from both video teachers and image teachers by masked\nfeature modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that video\ntransformers pretrained with spatial-temporal co-teaching outperform models\ndistilled with a single teacher on a multitude of video datasets. Our MVD with\nvanilla ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous\nsupervised or self-supervised methods on several challenging video downstream\ntasks. For example, with the ViT-Large model, our MVD achieves 86.4% and 75.9%\nTop-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-v2, outperforming\nVideoMAE by 1.2% and 1.6% respectively.

    "abstract": "Reading a qubit is a fundamental operation in quantum computing. It\ntranslates quantum information into classical information enabling subsequent\nclassification to assign the qubit states `0' or `1'. Unfortunately, qubit\nreadout is one of the most error-prone and slowest operations on a\nsuperconducting quantum processor. On state-of-the-art superconducting quantum\nprocessors, readout errors can range from 1-10%. The error-prone nature of\nreadout has resulted in significant research to design better discriminators to\nachieve higher qubit-readout accuracies. The readout accuracy impacts the\nbenchmark fidelity for Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) applications or\nthe logical error rate in error-correcting codes such as the surface code.\nPrior works have used machine-learning-assisted single-shot qubit-state\nclassification, where a deep neural network was used for more robust\ndiscrimination by compensating for crosstalk errors. However, the neural\nnetwork size can limit the scalability of systems, especially if fast hardware\ndiscrimination is required. This state-of-the-art baseline design cannot be\nimplemented on off-the-shelf FPGAs used for the control and readout of\nsuperconducting qubits in most systems, which increases the overall readout\nlatency, since discrimination has to be performed in software.\nIn this work, we propose HERQULES, a scalable approach to improve qubit-state\ninference by using matched filters in conjunction with a significantly smaller\nand scalable neural network for qubit-state discrimination. We achieve\nsubstantially higher readout accuracies (16.4% relative improvement) than the\nbaseline with a scalable design that can be readily implemented on\noff-the-shelf FPGAs. We also show that HERQULES is more versatile and can\nsupport shorter readout durations than the baseline design without additional\ntraining overheads.",

    "abstract": "On superconducting architectures, the state of a qubit is manipulated by\nusing microwave pulses. Typically, the pulses are stored in the waveform memory\nand then streamed to the Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) to synthesize the\ngate operations. The waveform memory requires tens of gigabytes per second of\nbandwidth to manipulate the qubit. Unfortunately, the required memory bandwidth\ngrows linearly with the number of qubits. As a result, the bandwidth demand\nlimits the number of qubits we can control concurrently. For example, on\ncurrent RFSoCs-based qubit control platforms, we can control less than 40\nqubits. In addition, the high memory bandwidth for cryogenic ASIC controllers\ndesigned to operate within a tight power budget translates to significant power\ndissipation, thus limiting scalability. In this paper, we show that waveforms\nare highly compressible, and we leverage this property to enable a scalable and\nefficient microarchitecture COMPAQT - Compressed Waveform Memory Architecture\nfor Qubit Control. Waveform memory is read-only and COMPAQT leverages this to\ncompress waveforms at compile time and store the compressed waveform in the\non-chip memory. To generate the pulse, COMPAQT decompresses the waveform at\nruntime and then streams the decompressed waveform to the DACs. Using the\nhardware-efficient discrete cosine transform, COMPAQT can achieve, on average,\n5x increase in the waveform memory bandwidth, which can enable 5x increase in\nthe total number of qubits controlled in an RFSoC setup. Moreover, COMPAQT\nmicroarchitecture for cryogenic CMOS ASIC controllers can result in a 2.5x\npower reduction over uncompressed baseline. We also propose an adaptive\ncompression scheme to further reduce the power consumed by the decompression\nengine, enabling up to 4x power reduction. We see less than 0.1% degradation in\nfidelity when using COMPAQT despite using a lossy compression scheme.",

    "abstract": "Many dynamical systems exhibit latent states with intrinsic orderings such as\n\"ally\", \"neutral\" and \"enemy\" relationships in international relations. Such\nlatent states are evidenced through entities' cooperative versus conflictual\ninteractions which are similarly ordered. Models of such systems often involve\nstate-to-action emission and state-to-state transition matrices. It is common\npractice to assume that the rows of these stochastic matrices are independently\nsampled from a Dirichlet distribution. However, this assumption discards\nordinal information and treats states and actions falsely as order-invariant\ncategoricals, which hinders interpretation and evaluation. To address this\nproblem, we propose the Ordered Matrix Dirichlet (OMD): rows are sampled\nconditionally dependent such that probability mass is shifted to the right of\nthe matrix as we move down rows. This results in a well-ordered mapping between\nlatent states and observed action types. We evaluate the OMD in two settings: a\nHidden Markov Model and a novel Bayesian Dynamic Poisson Tucker Model tailored\nto political event data. Models built on the OMD recover interpretable latent\nstates and show superior forecasting performance in few-shot settings. We\ndetail the wide applicability of the OMD to other domains where models with\nDirichlet-sampled matrices are popular (e.g. topic modeling) and publish\nuser-friendly code.",

This leads to a new criterion for causal discovery: the\nhigher capacity is consistent with the unconstrained choice of a distribution\nrepresenting the cause while the lower capacity reflects the constraints\nimposed by the mechanism on the distribution of the effect. Estimation capacity\nis defined as the ability of the auto-encoder to represent arbitrary datasets.\nA regularization term forces it to decide which one of the variables to model\nin a more generic way i.e., while maintaining higher model capacity. The causal\ndirection is revealed by the constraints encountered while encoding the data\ninstead of being measured as a property of the data itself.

    "abstract": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a standard-of-care treatment for locally\nadvanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) before surgery. The early\nassessment of TNBC response to NAC would enable an oncologist to adapt the\ntherapeutic plan of a non-responding patient, thereby improving treatment\noutcomes while preventing unnecessary toxicities. To this end, a promising\napproach consists of obtaining \\textsl{in silico} personalized forecasts of\ntumor response to NAC \\textsl{via} computer simulation of mechanistic models\nconstrained with patient-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data\nacquired early during NAC. Here, we present a model featuring the essential\nmechanisms of TNBC growth and response to NAC, including an explicit\ndescription of drug pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. As longitudinal\n\\textsl{in vivo} MRI data for model calibration is limited, we perform a\nsensitivity analysis to identify the model mechanisms driving the response to\ntwo NAC drug combinations: doxorubicin with cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel\nwith carboplatin. The model parameter space is constructed by combining\npatient-specific MRI-based \\textsl{in silico} parameter estimates and\n\\textit{in vitro} measurements of pharmacodynamic parameters obtained using\ntime-resolved microscopy assays of several TNBC lines. The sensitivity analysis\nis run in two MRI-based scenarios corresponding to a well-perfused and a\npoorly-perfused tumor. Out of the 15 parameters considered herein, only the\nbaseline tumor cell net proliferation rate along with the maximum\nconcentrations and effects of doxorubicin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel exhibit\na relevant impact on model forecasts (total effect index, $S_T>$0.1).

However,\nwhen the quality of the data is not optimal, the resulting behavioural policy\nalso performs sub-optimally once deployed. Recently, there has been a surge in\noffline reinforcement learning methods that hold the promise to extract\nhigh-quality policies from sub-optimal historical data. A common approach is to\nperform regularisation during training, encouraging updates during policy\nevaluation and/or policy improvement to stay close to the underlying data. In\nthis work, we investigate whether an offline approach to improving the quality\nof the existing data can lead to improved behavioural policies without any\nchanges in the BC algorithm. The proposed data improvement approach -\nTrajectory Stitching (TS) - generates new trajectories (sequences of states and\nactions) by `stitching' pairs of states that were disconnected in the original\ndata and generating their connecting new action. By construction, these new\ntransitions are guaranteed to be highly plausible according to probabilistic\nmodels of the environment, and to improve a state-value function. We\ndemonstrate that the iterative process of replacing old trajectories with new\nones incrementally improves the underlying behavioural policy. Extensive\nexperimental results show that significant performance gains can be achieved\nusing TS over BC policies extracted from the original data. Furthermore, using\nthe D4RL benchmarking suite, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art results are\nobtained by combining TS with two existing offline learning methodologies\nreliant on BC, model-based offline planning (MBOP) and policy constraint\n(TD3+BC).",

    "abstract": "PANOC is an algorithm for nonconvex optimization that has recently gained\npopularity in real-time control applications due to its fast, global\nconvergence. The present work proposes a variant of PANOC that makes use of\nGauss-Newton directions to accelerate the method. Furthermore, we show that\nwhen applied to optimal control problems, the computation of this Gauss-Newton\nstep can be cast as a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem, allowing for an\nefficient solution through the Riccati recursion. Finally, we demonstrate that\nthe proposed algorithm is more than twice as fast as the traditional L-BFGS\nvariant of PANOC when applied to an optimal control benchmark problem, and that\nthe performance scales favorably with increasing horizon length.",

    "abstract": "We introduce GAUCHE, a library for GAUssian processes in CHEmistry. Gaussian\nprocesses have long been a cornerstone of probabilistic machine learning,\naffording particular advantages for uncertainty quantification and Bayesian\noptimisation. Extending Gaussian processes to chemical representations,\nhowever, is nontrivial, necessitating kernels defined over structured inputs\nsuch as graphs, strings and bit vectors. By defining such kernels in GAUCHE, we\nseek to open the door to powerful tools for uncertainty quantification and\nBayesian optimisation in chemistry. Motivated by scenarios frequently\nencountered in experimental chemistry, we showcase applications for GAUCHE in\nmolecular discovery and chemical reaction optimisation.

    "abstract": "Mineral identification using remote sensing technologies is becoming more\ndominant in this field since it saves time by demonstrating a more effective\nway for land resources survey. In such remote sensing technologies,\nhyperspectral remote sensing (HSRS) technology has increased gradually for its\nefficient manner. This technology is usually used from an airborne platform,\ni.e., satellite. Hence, satellite imagery remote sensing technology is now more\ncapable of providing accuracy in mineral identification, and mapping.\nHyperspectral satellite imagery can identify minerals more accurately compared\nto traditional technologies in remote sensing by constructing a complete\nreflectance of the spectrum from each pixel with its advanced imaging sensor.\nBangladesh is a developing country with an area of 1,50,000 square kilometers\nlocated in Southeast Asia. Though it is a small country, it is enriched with\nseveral mineral resources through rivers, forests, hills, and the Bay of\nBengal. In this study, hyperspectral imaging technology is employed on some\nmajor identical areas (Maheshkhali, Netrokona, Panchagarh, and Patuakhali) of\nBangladesh to identify minerals there. As there are no studies done in\nBangladesh using hyperspectral imaging yet, it is a good opportunity to explore\nthe potentiality of HS imagery in this field. In this study, the FLAASH (Fast\nLine-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis) module with necessary parameter settings is\nused to filter the data, and finally, mineral identification is done by the\nspectral matched filtering method. Our investigation resulted in finding some\npotential minerals in those areas including Stariolite, Diasphore, Zircon,\nAlunite, Quartz, and so on. This indicates that there still is enormous\npotential for further exploration of minerals in Bangladesh by Hyperspectral\nSatellite Imagery.",

    "title": "Learning Quantum Processes and Hamiltonians via the Pauli Transfer  Matrix",
    "abstract": "Learning about physical systems from quantum-enhanced experiments, relying on\na quantum memory and quantum processing, can outperform learning from\nexperiments in which only classical memory and processing are available.\nWhereas quantum advantages have been established for a variety of state\nlearning tasks, quantum process learning allows for comparable advantages only\nwith a careful problem formulation and is less understood. We establish an\nexponential quantum advantage for learning an unknown $n$-qubit quantum process\n$\\mathcal{N}$. We show that a quantum memory allows to efficiently solve the\nfollowing tasks: (a) learning the Pauli transfer matrix of an arbitrary\n$\\mathcal{N}$, (b) predicting expectation values of bounded Pauli-sparse\nobservables measured on the output of an arbitrary $\\mathcal{N}$ upon input of\na Pauli-sparse state, and (c) predicting expectation values of arbitrary\nbounded observables measured on the output of an unknown $\\mathcal{N}$ with\nsparse Pauli transfer matrix upon input of an arbitrary state. With quantum\nmemory, these tasks can be solved using linearly-in-$n$ many copies of the Choi\nstate of $\\mathcal{N}$, and even time-efficiently in the case of (b). In\ncontrast, any learner without quantum memory requires exponentially-in-$n$ many\nqueries, even when querying $\\mathcal{N}$ on subsystems of adaptively chosen\nstates and performing adaptively chosen measurements. In proving this\nseparation, we extend existing shadow tomography upper and lower bounds from\nstates to channels via the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism. Moreover, we combine\nPauli transfer matrix learning with polynomial interpolation techniques to\ndevelop a procedure for learning arbitrary Hamiltonians, which may have\nnon-local all-to-all interactions, from short-time dynamics. Our results\nhighlight the power of quantum-enhanced experiments for learning highly complex\nquantum dynamics.",

One approach for finding\npotential climate change indicators is to train a model that predicts the year\nfrom annual means of global temperatures and precipitations. Such data is\navailable from the CMIP6 ensemble of simulations. Here a two-hidden-layer\nneural network trained on this data successfully predicts the year. Differences\namong temperature and precipitation patterns for which the model predicts\nspecific years reveal changes through time. To find these optimal patterns, a\nnew way of interpreting what the neural network has learned is explored.\nAlopex, a stochastic correlative learning algorithm, is used to find optimal\ntemperature and precipitation maps that best predict a given year. These maps\nare compared over multiple years to show how temperature and precipitations\npatterns indicative of each year change over time.",

This improves skill but can lead to\npredictions that violate physical principles or disregard dependencies between\nvariables, which can be problematic for downstream applications and for the\ntrustworthiness of postprocessing models, especially when they are based on new\nmachine learning approaches. Building on recent advances in physics-informed\nmachine learning, we propose to achieve physical consistency in deep\nlearning-based postprocessing models by integrating meteorological expertise in\nthe form of analytic equations. Applied to the post-processing of surface\nweather in Switzerland, we find that constraining a neural network to enforce\nthermodynamic state equations yields physically-consistent predictions of\ntemperature and humidity without compromising performance. Our approach is\nespecially advantageous when data is scarce, and our findings suggest that\nincorporating domain expertise into postprocessing models allows to optimize\nweather forecast information while satisfying application-specific\nrequirements.",
