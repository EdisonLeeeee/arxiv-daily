    "abstract": "While recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) language models\ndemonstrate cutting-edge performance when working with English texts,\nequivalent models do not exist in other languages or do not reach the same\nperformance level. This undesired effect of AI advancements increases the gap\nbetween access to new technology from different populations across the world.\nThis unsought bias mainly discriminates against individuals whose English\nskills are less developed, e.g., non-English speakers children. Following\nsignificant advancements in AI research in recent years, OpenAI has recently\npresented DALL-E: a powerful tool for creating images based on English text\nprompts. While DALL-E is a promising tool for many applications, its decreased\nperformance when given input in a different language, limits its audience and\ndeepens the gap between populations. An additional limitation of the current\nDALL-E model is that it only allows for the creation of a few images in\nresponse to a given input prompt, rather than a series of consecutive coherent\nframes that tell a story or describe a process that changes over time. Here, we\npresent an easy-to-use automatic DALL-E storytelling framework that leverages\nthe existing DALL-E model to enable fast and coherent visualizations of\nnon-English songs and stories, pushing the limit of the one-step-at-a-time\noption DALL-E currently offers. We show that our framework is able to\neffectively visualize stories from non-English texts and portray the changes in\nthe plot over time. It is also able to create a narrative and maintain\ninterpretable changes in the description across frames. Additionally, our\nframework offers users the ability to specify constraints on the story\nelements, such as a specific location or context, and to maintain a consistent\nstyle throughout the visualization.",

    "abstract": "The arise of cutting-edge technologies and services such as XR promise to\nchange the concepts of how day-to-day things are done. At the same time, the\nappearance of modern and decentralized architectures approaches has given birth\nto a new generation of mobile networks such as 5G, as well as outlining the\nroadmap for B5G and posterior. These networks are expected to be the enablers\nfor bringing to life the Metaverse and other futuristic approaches. In this\nsense, this work presents an ML-based (Machine Learning) framework that allows\nthe estimation of service Key Quality Indicators (KQIs). For this, only\ninformation reachable to operators is required, such as statistics and\nconfiguration parameters from these networks. This strategy prevents operators\nfrom avoiding intrusion into the user data and guaranteeing privacy. To test\nthis proposal, 360-Video has been selected as a use case of Virtual Reality\n(VR), from which specific KQIs are estimated such as video resolution, frame\nrate, initial startup time, throughput, and latency, among others. To select\nthe best model for each KQI, a search grid with a cross-validation strategy has\nbeen used to determine the best hyperparameter tuning. To boost the creation of\neach KQI model, feature engineering techniques together with cross-validation\nstrategies have been used. The performance is assessed using MAE (Mean Average\nError) and the prediction time. The outcomes point out that KNR (K-Near\nNeighbors) and RF (Random Forest) are the best algorithms in combination with\nFeature Selection techniques. Likewise, this work will help as a baseline for\nE2E-Quality-of-Experience-based network management working in conjunction with\nnetwork slicing, virtualization, and MEC, among other enabler technologies.",

    "abstract": "Tydi is an open specification for streaming dataflow designs in digital\ncircuits, allowing designers to express how composite and variable-length data\nstructures are transferred over streams using clear, data-centric types. This\nprovides a higher-level method for defining interfaces between components as\nopposed to existing bit- and byte-based interface specifications.\nIn this thesis, an open-source intermediate representation (IR) is introduced\nwhich allows for the declaration of Tydi's types. The IR enables creating and\nconnecting components with Tydi Streams as interfaces, called Streamlets. It\nalso lets backends for synthesis and simulation retain high-level information,\nsuch as documentation. Types and Streamlets can be easily reused between\nmultiple projects, and Tydi's streams and type hierarchy can be used to define\ninterface contracts, which aid collaboration when designing a larger system.\nThe IR codifies the rules and properties established in the Tydi\nspecification and serves to complement computation-oriented hardware design\ntools with a data-centric view on interfaces. To support different backends and\ntargets, the IR is focused on expressing interfaces, and complements behavior\ndescribed by hardware description languages and other IRs. Additionally, a\ntesting syntax for the verification of inputs and outputs against abstract\nstreams of data, and for substituting interdependent components, is presented\nwhich allows for the specification of behavior.\nTo demonstrate this IR, a grammar, parser, and query system have been\ncreated, and paired with a backend targeting VHDL.",

In particular, the\nuncertainty in predicting the behavior of other vehicles on the road leads to\nindecisive actions while changing lanes, which, might result in traffic\ncongestion and cause safety concerns. This paper analyzes the factors related\nto uncertainty such as speed range change and lane change so as to design a\npredictive Markov decision process for lane-change maneuver in the urban\nsetting. A hidden Markov model is developed for modeling uncertainties of\nsurrounding vehicles. The reward model uses the crash probabilities and the\nfeasibility/distance to the goal as primary parameters.

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that fine-tuning large pre-trained language models on a\ncollection of tasks described via instructions, a.k.a. instruction-tuning,\nimproves their zero and few-shot generalization to unseen tasks. However, there\nis a limited understanding of the performance trade-offs of different decisions\nmade during the instruction-tuning process. These decisions include the scale\nand diversity of the instruction-tuning benchmark, different task sampling\nstrategies, fine-tuning with and without demonstrations, training using\nspecialized datasets for reasoning and dialogue, and finally, the fine-tuning\nobjectives themselves. In this paper, we characterize the effect of\ninstruction-tuning decisions on downstream task performance when scaling both\nmodel and benchmark sizes. To this end, we create OPT-IML Bench: a large\nbenchmark for Instruction Meta-Learning (IML) of 2000 NLP tasks consolidated\ninto task categories from 8 existing benchmarks, and prepare an evaluation\nframework to measure three types of model generalizations: to tasks from fully\nheld-out categories, to held-out tasks from seen categories, and to held-out\ninstances from seen tasks. Through the lens of this framework, we first present\ninsights about instruction-tuning decisions as applied to OPT-30B and further\nexploit these insights to train OPT-IML 30B and 175B, which are\ninstruction-tuned versions of OPT. OPT-IML demonstrates all three\ngeneralization abilities at both scales on four different evaluation benchmarks\nwith diverse tasks and input formats -- PromptSource, FLAN,\nSuper-NaturalInstructions, and UnifiedSKG. Not only does it significantly\noutperform OPT on all benchmarks but is also highly competitive with existing\nmodels fine-tuned on each specific benchmark.

Programmers called\nperformance engineers are responsible for the challenging task of optimising\nprograms. Two major challenges prevent modern compilers targeting heterogeneous\narchitectures from reliably automating optimisation. First, domain-specific\ncompilers such as Halide for image processing and TVM for machine learning are\ndifficult to extend with the new optimisations required by new algorithms and\nhardware. Second, automatic optimisation is often unable to achieve the\nrequired performance, and performance engineers often fall back to painstaking\nmanual optimisation.\nThis thesis shows the potential of the Shine compiler to achieve\ndomain-extensibility, controllable automation, and generate high performance\ncode. Domain-extensibility facilitates adapting compilers to new algorithms and\nhardware. Controllable automation enables performance engineers to gradually\ntake control of the optimisation process.\nThe first research contribution is to add 3 code generation features to\nShine, namely: synchronisation barrier insertion, kernel execution, and storage\nfolding. The second research contribution is to demonstrate how extensibility\nand controllability are exploited to optimise a standard image processing\npipeline for corner detection. The final research contribution is to introduce\nsketch-guided equality saturation, a semi-automated technique that allows\nperformance engineers to guide program rewriting by specifying rewrite goals as\nsketches: program patterns that leave details unspecified.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a novel reduced-order model (ROM) for the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equations with time-dependent boundary conditions. This ROM is\nvelocity-only, i.e. the simulation of the velocity does not require the\ncomputation of the pressure, and preserves the structure of the kinetic energy\nevolution. The key ingredient of the novel ROM is a decomposition of the\nvelocity into a field with homogeneous boundary conditions and a lifting\nfunction that satisfies the mass equation with the prescribed inhomogeneous\nboundary conditions. This decomposition is inspired by the Helmholtz-Hodge\ndecomposition and exhibits orthogonality of the two components. This\northogonality is crucial to preserve the structure of the kinetic energy\nevolution. To make the evaluation of the lifting function efficient, we propose\na novel method that involves an explicit approximation of the boundary\nconditions with POD modes, while preserving the orthogonality of the velocity\ndecomposition and thus the structure of the kinetic energy evolution. We show\nthat the proposed velocity-only ROM is equivalent to a velocity-pressure ROM,\ni.e., a ROM that simulates both velocity and pressure. This equivalence can be\ngeneralized to other existing velocity-pressure ROMs and reveals valuable\ninsights in their behaviour. Numerical experiments on test cases with\ninflow-outflow boundary conditions confirm the correctness and efficiency of\nthe new ROM, and the equivalence with the velocity-pressure formulation.",

    "abstract": "Learning fair graph representations for downstream applications is becoming\nincreasingly important, but existing work has mostly focused on improving\nfairness at the global level by either modifying the graph structure or\nobjective function without taking into account the local neighborhood of a\nnode. In this work, we formally introduce the notion of neighborhood fairness\nand develop a computational framework for learning such locally fair\nembeddings. We argue that the notion of neighborhood fairness is more\nappropriate since GNN-based models operate at the local neighborhood level of a\nnode. Our neighborhood fairness framework has two main components that are\nflexible for learning fair graph representations from arbitrary data: the first\naims to construct fair neighborhoods for any arbitrary node in a graph and the\nsecond enables adaption of these fair neighborhoods to better capture certain\napplication or data-dependent constraints, such as allowing neighborhoods to be\nmore biased towards certain attributes or neighbors in the graph.Furthermore,\nwhile link prediction has been extensively studied, we are the first to\ninvestigate the graph representation learning task of fair link classification.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed neighborhood fairness\nframework for a variety of graph machine learning tasks including fair link\nprediction, link classification, and learning fair graph embeddings. Notably,\nour approach achieves not only better fairness but also increases the accuracy\nin the majority of cases across a wide variety of graphs, problem settings, and\nmetrics.",

    "abstract": "The recent emergence of new algorithms for permuting models into functionally\nequivalent regions of the solution space has shed some light on the complexity\nof error surfaces, and some promising properties like mode connectivity.\nHowever, finding the right permutation is challenging, and current optimization\ntechniques are not differentiable, which makes it difficult to integrate into a\ngradient-based optimization, and often leads to sub-optimal solutions. In this\npaper, we propose a Sinkhorn re-basin network with the ability to obtain the\ntransportation plan that better suits a given objective. Unlike the current\nstate-of-art, our method is differentiable and, therefore, easy to adapt to any\ntask within the deep learning domain. Furthermore, we show the advantage of our\nre-basin method by proposing a new cost function that allows performing\nincremental learning by exploiting the linear mode connectivity property. The\nbenefit of our method is compared against similar approaches from the\nliterature, under several conditions for both optimal transport finding and\nlinear mode connectivity. The effectiveness of our continual learning method\nbased on re-basin is also shown for several common benchmark datasets,\nproviding experimental results that are competitive with state-of-art results\nfrom the literature.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP have shown impressive\nperformance on zero-shot image classification and image-to-text retrieval.\nHowever, such zero-shot performance of CLIP-based models does not realize in\ntasks that require a finer-grained correspondence between vision and language,\nsuch as Visual Question Answering (VQA). We investigate why this is the case,\nand report an interesting phenomenon of CLIP, which we call the Concept\nAssociation Bias (CAB), as a potential cause of the difficulty of applying CLIP\nto VQA and similar tasks. CAB is especially apparent when two concepts are\npresent in the given image while a text prompt only contains a single concept.\nIn such a case, we find that CLIP tends to treat input as a bag of concepts and\nattempts to fill in the other missing concept crossmodally, leading to an\nunexpected zero-shot prediction. For example, when asked for the color of a\nlemon in an image, CLIP predicts ``purple'' if the image contains a lemon and\nan eggplant. We demonstrate the Concept Association Bias of CLIP by showing\nthat CLIP's zero-shot classification performance greatly suffers when there is\na strong concept association between an object (e.g. lemon) and an attribute\n(e.g. its color). On the other hand, when the association between object and\nattribute is weak, we do not see this phenomenon. Furthermore, we show that CAB\nis significantly mitigated when we enable CLIP to learn deeper structure across\nimage and text embeddings by adding an additional Transformer on top of CLIP\nand fine-tuning it on VQA. We find that across such fine-tuned variants of\nCLIP, the strength of CAB in a model predicts how well it performs on VQA.",

The field of neural-symbolic AI attempts to exploit this asymmetry\nby combining neural networks and symbolic AI into integrated systems.

We seek to\nrectify this problem by introducing a semantic framework for neural-symbolic\nAI, which is then shown to be general enough to account for a large family of\nneural-symbolic systems. We provide a number of examples and proofs of the\napplication of the framework to the neural encoding of various forms of\nknowledge representation and neural network.

However, the significant\nincreases of resource usage dynamics in both geographical and time and network\ncomplexity may lead to unnecessary high energy consumption in RANs without an\nefficient RAN function management policy. Many studies have proposed baseband\nfunction management solutions, however, the activation cost and data network\nresources of edge computing capacities have not been evaluated in much detail,\nas far as the authors know. In this paper, with the objective of minimizing\nenergy consumption, meanwhile, satisfying the requests over the network under\nthe constraints of latency and resource capacity, we propose a completed mixed\ninteger linear programming (MILP) formulation, a multi-agent deep reinforcement\nlearning-based algorithm and a heuristic (DCUH), to take user plane functions\n(UPFs) on the multi-access edge computing servers (MECs) and the activation\nconsumption of MECs into consideration.

Recent advances in machine learning,\nsuch as Graph Neural Networks (GNN), are enabling a new generation of network\nmodels that are data-driven and can learn complex non-linear behaviors. In this\npaper, we present RouteNet-Fermi, a custom GNN model that shares the same goals\nas queuing theory, while being considerably more accurate in the presence of\nrealistic traffic models. The proposed model predicts accurately the delay,\njitter, and loss in networks. We have tested RouteNet-Fermi in networks of\nincreasing size (up to 300 nodes), including samples with mixed traffic\nprofiles -- e.g., with complex non-markovian models -- and arbitrary routing\nand queue scheduling configurations. Our experimental results show that\nRouteNet-Fermi achieves similar accuracy as computationally-expensive\npacket-level simulators and it is able to accurately scale to large networks.\nFor example, the model produces delay estimates with a mean relative error of\n6.24% when applied to a test dataset with 1,000 samples, including network\ntopologies one order of magnitude larger than those seen during training.",

Specifically, we\npropose the \"eigeninit\" initialisation scheme that samples initial Koopman\noperators from specific eigenvalue distributions. In addition, we suggest the\n\"eigenloss\" penalty scheme that penalises the eigenvalues of the Koopman\noperator during training. We demonstrate the utility of these schemes on two\nsynthetic data sets: a driven pendulum and flow past a cylinder; and two\nreal-world problems: ocean surface temperatures and cyclone wind fields. We\nfind on these datasets that eigenloss and eigeninit improves the convergence\nrate by up to a factor of 5, and that they reduce the cumulative long-term\nprediction error by up to a factor of 3.

The robustness and effectiveness of the ensemble\nclassifier lie in the selection of the pool of classifiers, as well as in the\nlearning process. Hence, the selection and the training procedure of the pool\nof classifiers play a crucial role. An (ensemble) classifier learns to detect\nthe classes that were used during the supervised training.

We study the computational complexity of problems that regard the\nselection of cell values in the presence of integrity constraints. More\nprecisely, we focus on functional dependencies and study three problems: (1)\ndeciding whether the constraints can be satisfied by any choice of values, (2)\nfinding a most probable such choice, and (3) calculating the probability of\nsatisfying the constraints. The data complexity of these problems is determined\nby the combination of the set of functional dependencies and the collection of\nuncertain attributes. We give full classifications into tractable and\nintractable complexities for several classes of constraints, including a single\ndependency, matching constraints, and unary functional dependencies.",

    "abstract": "Dense prediction tasks such as segmentation and detection of pathological\nentities hold crucial clinical value in the digital pathology workflow.\nHowever, obtaining dense annotations on large cohorts is usually tedious and\nexpensive. Contrastive learning (CL) is thus often employed to leverage large\nvolumes of unlabeled data to pre-train the backbone network. To boost CL for\ndense prediction, some studies have proposed variations of dense matching\nobjectives in pre-training. However, our analysis shows that employing existing\ndense matching strategies on histopathology images enforces invariance among\nincorrect pairs of dense features and, thus, is imprecise. To address this, we\npropose a precise location-based matching mechanism that utilizes the\noverlapping information between geometric transformations to precisely match\nregions in two augmentations. Extensive experiments on two pretraining datasets\n(TCGA-BRCA, NCT-CRC-HE) and three downstream datasets (GlaS, CRAG, BCSS)\nhighlight the superiority of our method in semantic and instance segmentation\ntasks. Our method outperforms previous dense matching methods by up to 7.2 % in\naverage precision for detection and 5.6 % in average precision for instance\nsegmentation tasks. Additionally, by using our matching mechanism in the three\npopular contrastive learning frameworks, MoCo-v2, VICRegL and ConCL, the\naverage precision in detection is improved by 0.7 % to 5.2 % and the average\nprecision in segmentation is improved by 0.7 % to 4.0 %, demonstrating its\ngeneralizability.",

    "abstract": "Front-running attacks have been a major concern on the blockchain. Attackers\nlaunch front-running attacks by inserting additional transactions before\nupcoming victim transactions to manipulate victim transaction executions and\nmake profits. Recent studies have shown that front-running attacks are\nprevalent on the Ethereum blockchain and have caused millions of US dollars\nloss. Vulnerable smart contracts, blockchain programs invoked by transactions,\nare held responsible for front-running attacks. Although techniques to detect\nfront-running vulnerabilities have been proposed, their performance on\nreal-world vulnerable contracts is unclear. There is no large-scale benchmark\nbased on real attacks to evaluate their capabilities. This motivates us to\nbuild a benchmark consisting of 513 real-world attacks with vulnerable code\nlabeled in 235 distinct smart contracts. We propose automated techniques to\neffectively collect real-world attacks and localize the corresponding\nvulnerable code at scale. Our experiments show that our approaches are\neffective, achieving higher recall in finding real attacks and higher precision\nin pinpointing vulnerabilities compared to the existing techniques. The\nevaluation of seven state-of-the-art vulnerability detection techniques on the\nbenchmark reveals their inadequacy in detecting front-running vulnerabilities,\nwith a low recall of at most 6.04%.

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based methods have achieved significant performance for image\ndefogging. However, existing methods are mainly developed for land scenes and\nperform poorly when dealing with overwater foggy images, since overwater scenes\ntypically contain large expanses of sky and water. In this work, we propose a\nPrior map Guided CycleGAN (PG-CycleGAN) for defogging of images with overwater\nscenes. To promote the recovery of the objects on water in the image, two loss\nfunctions are exploited for the network where a prior map is designed to invert\nthe dark channel and the min-max normalization is used to suppress the sky and\nemphasize objects. However, due to the unpaired training set, the network may\nlearn an under-constrained domain mapping from foggy to fog-free image, leading\nto artifacts and loss of details. Thus, we propose an intuitive Upscaling\nInception Module (UIM) and a Long-range Residual Coarse-to-fine framework (LRC)\nto mitigate this issue. Extensive experiments on qualitative and quantitative\ncomparisons demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised defogging\napproaches.",

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has\nbeen proposed to separate network traffics into two disjoint subspaces\ncorresponding to normal and malicious behaviors for anomaly detection. However,\nthe privacy concerns and limitations of devices' computing resources compromise\nthe practical effectiveness of PCA. We propose a federated PCA-based\nGrassmannian optimization framework that coordinates IoT devices to aggregate a\njoint profile of normal network behaviors for anomaly detection. First, we\nintroduce a privacy-preserving federated PCA framework to simultaneously\ncapture the profile of various IoT devices' traffic. Then, we investigate the\nalternating direction method of multipliers gradient-based learning on the\nGrassmann manifold to guarantee fast training and the absence of detecting\nlatency using limited computational resources. Empirical results on the NSL-KDD\ndataset demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches. Finally,\nwe show that the Grassmann manifold algorithm is highly adapted for IoT anomaly\ndetection, which permits drastically reducing the analysis time of the system.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first federated PCA algorithm for\nanomaly detection meeting the requirements of IoT networks.",

    "abstract": "Open vocabulary object detection has been greatly advanced by the recent\ndevelopment of vision-language pretrained model, which helps recognize novel\nobjects with only semantic categories. The prior works mainly focus on\nknowledge transferring to the object proposal classification and employ\nclass-agnostic box and mask prediction. In this work, we propose CondHead, a\nprincipled dynamic network design to better generalize the box regression and\nmask segmentation for open vocabulary setting. The core idea is to\nconditionally parameterize the network heads on semantic embedding and thus the\nmodel is guided with class-specific knowledge to better detect novel\ncategories. Specifically, CondHead is composed of two streams of network heads,\nthe dynamically aggregated head and the dynamically generated head. The former\nis instantiated with a set of static heads that are conditionally aggregated,\nthese heads are optimized as experts and are expected to learn sophisticated\nprediction. The latter is instantiated with dynamically generated parameters\nand encodes general class-specific information. With such a conditional design,\nthe detection model is bridged by the semantic embedding to offer strongly\ngeneralizable class-wise box and mask prediction.

First, regression analyses show a strictly monotonic,\npositive log-linear relationship between perplexity and fit to reading times\nfor the more recently released five GPT-Neo variants and eight OPT variants on\ntwo separate datasets, replicating earlier results limited to just GPT-2 (Oh et\nal., 2022). Subsequently, analysis of residual errors reveals a systematic\ndeviation of the larger variants, such as underpredicting reading times of\nnamed entities and making compensatory overpredictions for reading times of\nfunction words such as modals and conjunctions. These results suggest that the\npropensity of larger Transformer-based models to 'memorize' sequences during\ntraining makes their surprisal estimates diverge from humanlike expectations,\nwhich warrants caution in using pre-trained language models to study human\nlanguage processing.",

    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is an automatic technique that can search\nfor well-performed architectures for a specific task. Although NAS surpasses\nhuman-designed architecture in many fields, the high computational cost of\narchitecture evaluation it requires hinders its development. A feasible\nsolution is to directly evaluate some metrics in the initial stage of the\narchitecture without any training. NAS without training (WOT) score is such a\nmetric, which estimates the final trained accuracy of the architecture through\nthe ability to distinguish different inputs in the activation layer. However,\nWOT score is not an atomic metric, meaning that it does not represent a\nfundamental indicator of the architecture. The contributions of this paper are\nin three folds. First, we decouple WOT into two atomic metrics which represent\nthe distinguishing ability of the network and the number of activation units,\nand explore better combination rules named (Distinguishing Activation Score)\nDAS. We prove the correctness of decoupling theoretically and confirmed the\neffectiveness of the rules experimentally. Second, in order to improve the\nprediction accuracy of DAS to meet practical search requirements, we propose a\nfast training strategy. When DAS is used in combination with the fast training\nstrategy, it yields more improvements. Third, we propose a dataset called\nDarts-training-bench (DTB), which fills the gap that no training states of\narchitecture in existing datasets.

In practice,\na student's learning history comprises answers to sets of massed questions,\neach known as a session, rather than merely being a sequence of independent\nanswers. Theoretically, within and across these sessions, students' learning\ndynamics can be very different. Therefore, how to effectively model the\ndynamics of students' knowledge states within and across the sessions is\ncrucial for handling the KT problem. Most existing KT models treat student's\nlearning records as a single continuing sequence, without capturing the\nsessional shift of students' knowledge state. To address the above issue, we\npropose a novel hierarchical transformer model, named HiTSKT, comprises an\ninteraction(-level) encoder to capture the knowledge a student acquires within\na session, and a session(-level) encoder to summarise acquired knowledge across\nthe past sessions. To predict an interaction in the current session, a\nknowledge retriever integrates the summarised past-session knowledge with the\nprevious interactions' information into proper knowledge representations. These\nrepresentations are then used to compute the student's current knowledge state.\nAdditionally, to model the student's long-term forgetting behaviour across the\nsessions, a power-law-decay attention mechanism is designed and deployed in the\nsession encoder, allowing it to emphasize more on the recent sessions.\nExtensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HiTSKT achieves\nnew state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets compared with six\nstate-of-the-art KT models.",

This builds on work from Hudelmaier [Hud93] that found a similar\nresult for intuitionistic propositional logic, but for which only the height of\nthe proof was polynomially bounded, not the overall size. They arrive at this\nresult by transforming a proof in Hudelmaier's sequent calculus into an\nequivalent tree-like proof in Prawitz's system of natural deduction, and then\ncompressing the tree-like proof into an equivalent DAG-like proof in such a way\nthat a polynomial bound on the height and foundation implies a polynomial bound\non the overall size. Our paper, however, observes that this construction was\nperformed only on minimal implicational logic, which we show to be weaker than\nthe minimal propositional logic for which they claim the result (see Section\n4.2). Simply extending the logic systems used to cover minimal propositional\nlogic would not be sufficient to recover the results of the paper, as it would\nentirely disrupt proofs of a number of the theorems that are critical to\nproving the main result.

    "title": "EarSpy: Spying Caller Speech and Identity through Tiny Vibrations of  Smartphone Ear Speakers",
    "abstract": "Eavesdropping from the user's smartphone is a well-known threat to the user's\nsafety and privacy. Existing studies show that loudspeaker reverberation can\ninject speech into motion sensor readings, leading to speech eavesdropping.\nWhile more devastating attacks on ear speakers, which produce much smaller\nscale vibrations, were believed impossible to eavesdrop with zero-permission\nmotion sensors. In this work, we revisit this important line of reach. We\nexplore recent trends in smartphone manufacturers that include extra/powerful\nspeakers in place of small ear speakers, and demonstrate the feasibility of\nusing motion sensors to capture such tiny speech vibrations. We investigate the\nimpacts of these new ear speakers on built-in motion sensors and examine the\npotential to elicit private speech information from the minute vibrations. Our\ndesigned system EarSpy can successfully detect word regions, time, and\nfrequency domain features and generate a spectrogram for each word region. We\ntrain and test the extracted data using classical machine learning algorithms\nand convolutional neural networks. We found up to 98.66% accuracy in gender\ndetection, 92.6% detection in speaker detection, and 56.42% detection in digit\ndetection (which is 5X more significant than the random selection (10%)). Our\nresult unveils the potential threat of eavesdropping on phone conversations\nfrom ear speakers using motion sensors.",

    "abstract": "Learning on Graphs (LoG) is widely used in multi-client systems when each\nclient has insufficient local data, and multiple clients have to share their\nraw data to learn a model of good quality. One scenario is to recommend items\nto clients with limited historical data and sharing similar preferences with\nother clients in a social network. On the other hand, due to the increasing\ndemands for the protection of clients' data privacy, Federated Learning (FL)\nhas been widely adopted: FL requires models to be trained in a multi-client\nsystem and restricts sharing of raw data among clients. The underlying\npotential data-sharing conflict between LoG and FL is under-explored and how to\nbenefit from both sides is a promising problem. In this work, we first\nformulate the Graph Federated Learning (GFL) problem that unifies LoG and FL in\nmulti-client systems and then propose sharing hidden representation instead of\nthe raw data of neighbors to protect data privacy as a solution. To overcome\nthe biased gradient problem in GFL, we provide a gradient estimation method and\nits convergence analysis under the non-convex objective.

    "abstract": "As a software system evolves, its architecture tends to degrade, and\ngradually impedes software maintenance and evolution activities and negatively\nimpacts the quality attributes of the system. The main root cause behind\narchitecture erosion phenomenon derives from violation symptoms (such as\nviolations of architecture pattern). Previous studies focus on detecting\nviolations in software systems using architecture conformance checking\napproaches. However, code review comments are also rich sources that may\ncontain extensive discussions regarding architecture violations. In this work,\nwe investigated the characteristics of architecture violation symptoms in code\nreview comments from the developers' perspective. We employed a set of keywords\nrelated to violation symptoms to collect 606 (out of 21,583) code review\ncomments from four popular OSS projects in the OpenStack and Qt communities. We\nmanually analyzed the collected 606 review comments to provide the categories\nand linguistic patterns of violation symptoms, as well as the reactions how\ndevelopers addressed them. Our findings show that: (1) 10 categories of\nviolation symptoms are discussed by developers during the code review process;\n(2) The frequently-used terms of expressing violation symptoms are\n\"inconsistent\" and \"violate\", and the most frequently-used linguistic pattern\nis Problem Discovery; (3) Refactoring and removing code are the major measures\n(90%) to tackle violation symptoms, while a few violation symptoms were ignored\nby developers. Our findings suggest that the investigation of violation\nsymptoms can help researchers better understand the characteristics of\narchitecture erosion and facilitate the development and maintenance activities,\nand developers should explicitly manage violation symptoms, not only for\naddressing the existing architecture violations but also preventing future\nviolations.",

These\napplications tend to be user-facing and latency-sensitive, and our goal is to\ncontinuously minimize the amount of CPU resources allocated while still\nsatisfying the application latency SLO. Although previous efforts have proposed\nsimple heuristics and sophisticated ML-based techniques, we believe that a\npractical resource manager should accurately scale CPU resources for diverse\napplications, with minimum human efforts and operation overheads. To this end,\nwe ask: can we systematically break resource management down to subproblems\nsolvable by practical policies? Based on the notion of CPU-throttle-based\nperformance target, we decouple the mechanisms of SLO feedback and resource\ncontrol, and implement a two-level framework -- Autothrottle. It combines a\nlightweight learned controller at the global level, and agile per-microservice\ncontrollers at the local level. We evaluate Autothrottle on three microservice\napplications, with both short-term and 21-day production workload traces.\nEmpirical results show Autothrottle's superior CPU core savings up to 26.21%\nover the best-performing baselines across applications, while maintaining the\nlatency SLO.",

    "abstract": "Real estate appraisal is a crucial issue for urban applications, which aims\nto value the properties on the market. Traditional methods perform appraisal\nbased on the domain knowledge, but suffer from the efforts of hand-crafted\ndesign. Recently, several methods have been developed to automatize the\nvaluation process by taking the property trading transaction into account when\nestimating the property value. However, existing methods only consider the real\nestate itself, ignoring the relation between the properties. Moreover, naively\naggregating the information of neighbors fails to model the relationships\nbetween the transactions. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel\nNeighbor Relation Graph Learning Framework (ReGram) by incorporating the\nrelation between target transaction and surrounding neighbors with the\nattention mechanism. To model the influence between communities, we integrate\nthe environmental information and the past price of each transaction from other\ncommunities. Moreover, since the target transactions in different regions share\nsome similarities and differences of characteristics, we introduce a dynamic\nadapter to model the different distributions of the target transactions based\non the input-related kernel weights. Extensive experiments on the real-world\ndataset with various scenarios demonstrate that ReGram robustly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies were\nconducted to examine the effectiveness of each component in ReGram.",

For classification problems, this work\ndelves into the mystery of transfer learning through an intriguing phenomenon\ntermed neural collapse (NC), where the last-layer features and classifiers of\nlearned deep networks satisfy: (i) the within-class variability of the features\ncollapses to zero, and (ii) the between-class feature means are maximally and\nequally separated.

    "title": "Investigation of reinforcement learning for shape optimization of  profile extrusion dies",
    "abstract": "Profile extrusion is a continuous production process for manufacturing\nplastic profiles from molten polymer. Especially interesting is the design of\nthe die, through which the melt is pressed to attain the desired shape.\nHowever, due to an inhomogeneous velocity distribution at the die exit or\nresidual stresses inside the extrudate, the final shape of the manufactured\npart often deviates from the desired one. To avoid these deviations, the shape\nof the die can be computationally optimized, which has already been\ninvestigated in the literature using classical optimization approaches.\nA new approach in the field of shape optimization is the utilization of\nReinforcement Learning (RL) as a learning-based optimization algorithm. RL is\nbased on trial-and-error interactions of an agent with an environment. For each\naction, the agent is rewarded and informed about the subsequent state of the\nenvironment. While not necessarily superior to classical, e.g., gradient-based\nor evolutionary, optimization algorithms for one single problem, RL techniques\nare expected to perform especially well when similar optimization tasks are\nrepeated since the agent learns a more general strategy for generating optimal\nshapes instead of concentrating on just one single problem.\nIn this work, we investigate this approach by applying it to two 2D test\ncases. The flow-channel geometry can be modified by the RL agent using\nso-called Free-Form Deformation, a method where the computational mesh is\nembedded into a transformation spline, which is then manipulated based on the\ncontrol-point positions. In particular, we investigate the impact of utilizing\ndifferent agents on the training progress and the potential of wall time saving\nby utilizing multiple environments during training.",

This is the first systematic numerical study of\npacking in regular polygons, which previously had only been carried out for the\nequilateral triangle, the square and the circle.",

    "title": "FFNeRV: Flow-Guided Frame-Wise Neural Representations for Videos",
    "abstract": "Neural fields, also known as coordinate-based or implicit neural\nrepresentations, have shown a remarkable capability of representing,\ngenerating, and manipulating various forms of signals. For video\nrepresentations, however, mapping pixel-wise coordinates to RGB colors has\nshown relatively low compression performance and slow convergence and inference\nspeed. Frame-wise video representation, which maps a temporal coordinate to its\nentire frame, has recently emerged as an alternative method to represent\nvideos, improving compression rates and encoding speed. While promising, it has\nstill failed to reach the performance of state-of-the-art video compression\nalgorithms. In this work, we propose FFNeRV, a novel method for incorporating\nflow information into frame-wise representations to exploit the temporal\nredundancy across the frames in videos inspired by the standard video codecs.\nFurthermore, we introduce a fully convolutional architecture, enabled by\none-dimensional temporal grids, improving the continuity of spatial features.\nExperimental results show that FFNeRV yields the best performance for video\ncompression and frame interpolation among the methods using frame-wise\nrepresentations or neural fields. To reduce the model size even further, we\ndevise a more compact convolutional architecture using the group and pointwise\nconvolutions. With model compression techniques, including quantization-aware\ntraining and entropy coding, FFNeRV outperforms widely-used standard video\ncodecs (H.264 and HEVC) and performs on par with state-of-the-art video\ncompression algorithms.",

The latter are\ndifferent from the classical Bidomain and Monodomain cardiac models based on\nhomogenized descriptions of the cardiac tissue at the macroscopic level, and\ntherefore they allow the representation of individual cardiac cells, cell\naggregates, damaged tissues and nonuniform distributions of ion channels on the\ncell membrane. The resulting discrete cell-by-cell models have discontinuous\nglobal solutions across the cell boundaries, hence the proposed BDDC\npreconditioner is based on appropriate dual and primal spaces with additional\nconstraints which transfer information between cells (subdomains) without\ninfluencing the overall discontinuity of the global solution.

While NoSQL\ndatabases are delivered with a default ''off-the-shelf'' configuration, they\noffer configuration settings to adjust a database's behavior and performance to\na specific use case and environment. The abundance and oftentimes imperceptible\ninter-dependencies of configuration settings make it difficult to optimize and\nperformance-tune a NoSQL system. There is no one-size-fits-all configuration\nand therefore the workload, the physical design, and available resources need\nto be taken into account when optimizing the configuration of a NoSQL database.\nThis work explores Machine Learning as a means to automatically tune a NoSQL\ndatabase for optimal performance. Using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting\nDecision Tree Machine Learning algorithms, multiple Machine Learning models\nwere fitted with a training dataset that incorporates properties of the NoSQL\nphysical configuration (replication and sharding). The best models were then\nemployed as surrogate models to optimize the Database Management System's\nconfiguration settings for throughput and latency using a Black-box\nOptimization algorithm. Using an Apache Cassandra database, multiple\nexperiments were carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach,\neven across varying physical configurations.

    "abstract": "The virtual machine consolidation problem (VMCP) attempts to determine which\nservers to be activated, how to allocate virtual machines (VMs) to the\nactivated servers, and how to migrate VMs among servers such that the summation\nof activated, allocation, and migration costs is minimized subject to the\nresource constraints of the servers and other practical constraints. In this\npaper, we first propose a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP)\nformulation for the VMCP. We show that compared with existing formulations, the\nproposed formulation is much more compact in terms of smaller numbers of\nvariables or constraints, which makes it suitable for solving large-scale\nproblems. We then develop a cut-and-solve (C&S) algorithm, a tree search\nalgorithm to efficiently solve the VMCP to optimality. The proposed C&S\nalgorithm is based on a novel relaxation of the VMCP that provides a stronger\nlower bound than the natural continuous relaxation of the VMCP, making a\nsmaller search tree. By extensive computational experiments, we show that (i)\nthe proposed formulation significantly outperforms existing formulations in\nterms of solution efficiency; and (ii) compared with standard MILP solvers, the\nproposed C&S algorithm is much more efficient.",

    "abstract": "Dataset scaling, also known as normalization, is an essential preprocessing\nstep in a machine learning pipeline. It is aimed at adjusting attributes scales\nin a way that they all vary within the same range. This transformation is known\nto improve the performance of classification models, but there are several\nscaling techniques to choose from, and this choice is not generally done\ncarefully. In this paper, we execute a broad experiment comparing the impact of\n5 scaling techniques on the performances of 20 classification algorithms among\nmonolithic and ensemble models, applying them to 82 publicly available datasets\nwith varying imbalance ratios. Results show that the choice of scaling\ntechnique matters for classification performance, and the performance\ndifference between the best and the worst scaling technique is relevant and\nstatistically significant in most cases. They also indicate that choosing an\ninadequate technique can be more detrimental to classification performance than\nnot scaling the data at all. We also show how the performance variation of an\nensemble model, considering different scaling techniques, tends to be dictated\nby that of its base model. Finally, we discuss the relationship between a\nmodel's sensitivity to the choice of scaling technique and its performance and\nprovide insights into its applicability on different model deployment\nscenarios.

    "abstract": "Networks have become indispensable and ubiquitous structures in many fields\nto model the interactions among different entities, such as friendship in\nsocial networks or protein interactions in biological graphs. A major challenge\nis to understand the structure and dynamics of these systems. Although networks\nevolve through time, most existing graph representation learning methods target\nonly static networks. Whereas approaches have been developed for the modeling\nof dynamic networks, there is a lack of efficient continuous time dynamic graph\nrepresentation learning methods that can provide accurate network\ncharacterization and visualization in low dimensions while explicitly\naccounting for prominent network characteristics such as homophily and\ntransitivity. In this paper, we propose the Piecewise-Velocity Model (PiVeM)\nfor the representation of continuous-time dynamic networks. It learns dynamic\nembeddings in which the temporal evolution of nodes is approximated by\npiecewise linear interpolations based on a latent distance model with piecewise\nconstant node-specific velocities. The model allows for analytically tractable\nexpressions of the associated Poisson process likelihood with scalable\ninference invariant to the number of events. We further impose a scalable\nKronecker structured Gaussian Process prior to the dynamics accounting for\ncommunity structure, temporal smoothness, and disentangled (uncorrelated)\nlatent embedding dimensions optimally learned to characterize the network\ndynamics. We show that PiVeM can successfully represent network structure and\ndynamics in ultra-low two-dimensional spaces. It outperforms relevant\nstate-of-art methods in downstream tasks such as link prediction. In summary,\nPiVeM enables easily interpretable dynamic network visualizations and\ncharacterizations that can further improve our understanding of the intrinsic\ndynamics of time-evolving networks.",

To address this problem, standards (ISO 21434/UNECE) expect\nmanufacturers to produce security arguments and evidence by carrying out\nappropriate threat analysis. As key threat analysis steps, e.g., damage/threat\nscenario and attack path enumeration, are often carried out manually and not\nrigorously, security arguments lack precise guarantees, e.g., traceability\nw.r.t. safety goals, especially under system updates. This article proposes\nautomated methods for threat analysis using a model-based engineering\nmethodology that provides precise guarantees with respect to safety goals. This\nis accomplished by proposing an intruder model for automotive SOA which\ntogether with the system architecture and the loss scenarios identified by\nsafety analysis are used as input for computing assets, impact rating,\ndamage/threat scenarios, and attack paths. To validate the proposed\nmethodology, we developed a faithful model of the autonomous driving functions\nof the Apollo framework, a widely used open-source autonomous driving stack.\nThe proposed machinery automatically enumerates several attack paths on Apollo,\nincluding attack paths not reported in the literature.",

While physically sound, classical\ngray-box models are often cumbersome to identify and scale, and their accuracy\nmight be hindered by their limited expressiveness. On the other hand, classical\nblack-box methods, typically relying on Neural Networks (NNs) nowadays, often\nachieve impressive performance, even at scale, by deriving statistical patterns\nfrom data. However, they remain completely oblivious to the underlying physical\nlaws, which may lead to potentially catastrophic failures if decisions for\nreal-world physical systems are based on them. Physically Consistent Neural\nNetworks (PCNNs) were recently developed to address these aforementioned\nissues, ensuring physical consistency while still leveraging NNs to attain\nstate-of-the-art accuracy.\nIn this work, we scale PCNNs to model building temperature dynamics and\npropose a thorough comparison with classical gray-box and black-box methods.\nMore precisely, we design three distinct PCNN extensions, thereby exemplifying\nthe modularity and flexibility of the architecture, and formally prove their\nphysical consistency. In the presented case study, PCNNs are shown to achieve\nstate-of-the-art accuracy, even outperforming classical NN-based models despite\ntheir constrained structure. Our investigations furthermore provide a clear\nillustration of NNs achieving seemingly good performance while remaining\ncompletely physics-agnostic, which can be misleading in practice. While this\nperformance comes at the cost of computational complexity, PCNNs on the other\nhand show accuracy improvements of 17-35% compared to all other physically\nconsistent methods, paving the way for scalable physically consistent models\nwith state-of-the-art performance.",

We\nadditionally learn the object-relation joint distribution via energy based\nmodeling. Sampling from this distribution generates a refined graph\nrepresentation of the image which in turn produces improved detection\nperformance. Experiments on the Visual Genome and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate\nour method is detector agnostic, end-to-end trainable, and especially\nbeneficial for rare object classes. What is more, we establish a consistent\nimprovement over object detectors like DETR and Faster-RCNN, as well as\nstate-of-the-art methods modeling object interrelationships.",

    "abstract": "We develop a new type of automated market maker (AMM) that helps to maintain\nstability and long-term viability in a stablecoin. This primary market AMM\n(P-AMM) is an autonomous mechanism for pricing minting and redemption of\nstablecoins in all possible states and is designed to achieve several desirable\nproperties. We first cover several case studies of current ad hoc stablecoin\nissuance and redemption mechanisms, several of which have contributed to recent\nstablecoin de-peggings, and formulate desirable properties of a P-AMM that\nsupport stability and usability. We then design a P-AMM redemption curve and\nshow that it satisfies these properties, including bounded loss for both the\nprotocol and stablecoin holders. We further show that this redemption curve is\npath independent and has properties of path deficiency in extended settings\ninvolving trading fees and a separate minting curve. This means that system\nhealth weakly improves relative to the path independent setting along any\ntrading curve and that there is no incentive to strategically subdivide\nredemptions. Finally, we show how to implement the P-AMM efficiently on-chain.",

    "abstract": "Feedforward fully convolutional neural networks currently dominate in\nsemantic segmentation of 3D point clouds. Despite their great success, they\nsuffer from the loss of local information at low-level layers, posing\nsignificant challenges to accurate scene segmentation and precise object\nboundary delineation. Prior works either address this issue by post-processing\nor jointly learn object boundaries to implicitly improve feature encoding of\nthe networks. These approaches often require additional modules which are\ndifficult to integrate into the original architecture.\nTo improve the segmentation near object boundaries, we propose a\nboundary-aware feature propagation mechanism. This mechanism is achieved by\nexploiting a multi-task learning framework that aims to explicitly guide the\nboundaries to their original locations. With one shared encoder, our network\noutputs (i) boundary localization, (ii) prediction of directions pointing to\nthe object's interior, and (iii) semantic segmentation, in three parallel\nstreams. The predicted boundaries and directions are fused to propagate the\nlearned features to refine the segmentation. We conduct extensive experiments\non the S3DIS and SensatUrban datasets against various baseline methods,\ndemonstrating that our proposed approach yields consistent improvements by\nreducing boundary errors.

    "abstract": "Obtaining labelled data in a particular context could be expensive and time\nconsuming. Although different algorithms, including unsupervised learning,\nsemi-supervised learning, self-learning have been adopted, the performance of\ntext classification varies with context. Given the lack of labelled dataset, we\nproposed a novel and simple unsupervised text classification model to classify\ncargo content in international shipping industry using the Standard\nInternational Trade Classification (SITC) codes. Our method stems from\nrepresenting words using pretrained Glove Word Embeddings and finding the most\nlikely label using Cosine Similarity. To compare unsupervised text\nclassification model with supervised classification, we also applied several\nTransformer models to classify cargo content. Due to lack of training data, the\nSITC numerical codes and the corresponding textual descriptions were used as\ntraining data. A small number of manually labelled cargo content data was used\nto evaluate the classification performances of the unsupervised classification\nand the Transformer based supervised classification. The comparison reveals\nthat unsupervised classification significantly outperforms Transformer based\nsupervised classification even after increasing the size of the training\ndataset by 30%. Lacking training data is a key bottleneck that prohibits deep\nlearning models (such as Transformers) from successful practical applications.\nUnsupervised classification can provide an alternative efficient and effective\nmethod to classify text when there is scarce training data.",

In this\npaper, we focus on a simple type of fixed-angle linkage: every edge has unit\nlength (equilateral), and each joint has a fixed angle of $90^\\circ$\n(orthogonal) or $180^\\circ$ (straight). When the linkage forms a path (open\nchain), it always has a planar configuration, namely the zig-zag which\nalternating the $90^\\circ$ angles between left and right turns. But when the\nlinkage forms a cycle (closed chain), or is forced to lie in a box of fixed\nsize, we prove that the flattening problem -- deciding whether there is a\nplanar noncrossing configuration -- is strongly NP-complete.\nBack to open chains, we turn to the Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic (HP) model of\nprotein folding, where each vertex is labeled H or P, and the goal is to find a\nfolding that maximizes the number of H-H adjacencies. In the well-studied HP\nmodel, the joint angles are not fixed. We introduce and analyze the fixed-angle\nHP model, which is motivated by real-world proteins. We prove strong\nNP-completeness of finding a planar noncrossing configuration of a fixed-angle\northogonal equilateral open chain with the most H--H adjacencies, even if the\nchain has only two H vertices.

    "abstract": "Linear partial differential equations (PDEs) are an important, widely applied\nclass of mechanistic models, describing physical processes such as heat\ntransfer, electromagnetism, and wave propagation. In practice, specialized\nnumerical methods based on discretization are used to solve PDEs. They\ngenerally use an estimate of the unknown model parameters and, if available,\nphysical measurements for initialization. Such solvers are often embedded into\nlarger scientific models or analyses with a downstream application such that\nerror quantification plays a key role. However, by entirely ignoring parameter\nand measurement uncertainty, classical PDE solvers may fail to produce\nconsistent estimates of their inherent approximation error. In this work, we\napproach this problem in a principled fashion by interpreting solving linear\nPDEs as physics-informed Gaussian process (GP) regression. Our framework is\nbased on a key generalization of a widely-applied theorem for conditioning GPs\non a finite number of direct observations to observations made via an arbitrary\nbounded linear operator. Crucially, this probabilistic viewpoint allows to (1)\nquantify the inherent discretization error; (2) propagate uncertainty about the\nmodel parameters to the solution; and (3) condition on noisy measurements.\nDemonstrating the strength of this formulation, we prove that it strictly\ngeneralizes methods of weighted residuals, a central class of PDE solvers\nincluding collocation, finite volume, pseudospectral, and (generalized)\nGalerkin methods such as finite element and spectral methods. This class can\nthus be directly equipped with a structured error estimate and the capability\nto incorporate uncertain model parameters and observations.

    "abstract": "We study an information theoretic privacy mechanism design problem for two\nscenarios where the private data is either observable or hidden. In each\nscenario, we first consider bounded mutual information as privacy leakage\ncriterion, then we use two different per-letter privacy constraints. In the\nfirst scenario, an agent observes useful data $Y$ that is correlated with\nprivate data $X$, and wishes to disclose the useful information to a user. A\nprivacy mechanism is designed to generate disclosed data $U$ which maximizes\nthe revealed information about $Y$ while satisfying a bounded privacy leakage\nconstraint. In the second scenario, the agent has additionally access to the\nprivate data. To this end, we first extend the Functional Representation Lemma\nand Strong Functional Representation Lemma by relaxing the independence\ncondition and thereby allowing a certain leakage to find lower bounds for the\nsecond scenario with different privacy leakage constraints. Furthermore, upper\nand lower bounds are derived in the first scenario considering different\nprivacy constraints. In particular, for the case where no leakage is allowed,\nour upper and lower bounds improve previous bounds. Moreover, considering\nbounded mutual information as privacy constraint we show that if the common\ninformation and mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ are equal, then the\nattained upper bound in the second scenario is tight. Finally, the\nprivacy-utility trade-off with prioritized private data is studied where part\nof $X$, i.e., $X_1$, is more private than the remaining part, i.e., $X_2$, and\nwe provide lower and upper bounds.",

This\narticle addresses both issues. First, we systematically organize and connect\npast studies to consolidate a community that is currently fragmented and\nscattered. Second, we propose a common benchmark that allows for an objective\ncomparison of approaches. It consists of five datasets spanning various domains\n(e.g., natural images, medical imagery, satellite data) and data types (RGB,\ngrayscale, multispectral). We use this benchmark to re-evaluate the standard\ncross-entropy baseline and ten existing methods published between 2017 and 2021\nat renowned venues. Surprisingly, we find that thorough hyper-parameter tuning\non held-out validation data results in a highly competitive baseline and\nhighlights a stunted growth of performance over the years. Indeed, only a\nsingle specialized method dating back to 2019 clearly wins our benchmark and\noutperforms the baseline classifier.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have received remarkable success in link\nprediction (GNNLP) tasks. Existing efforts first predefine the subgraph for the\nwhole dataset and then apply GNNs to encode edge representations by leveraging\nthe neighborhood structure induced by the fixed subgraph. The prominence of\nGNNLP methods significantly relies on the adhoc subgraph. Since node\nconnectivity in real-world graphs is complex, one shared subgraph is limited\nfor all edges. Thus, the choices of subgraphs should be personalized to\ndifferent edges. However, performing personalized subgraph selection is\nnontrivial since the potential selection space grows exponentially to the scale\nof edges. Besides, the inference edges are not available during training in\nlink prediction scenarios, so the selection process needs to be inductive. To\nbridge the gap, we introduce a Personalized Subgraph Selector (PS2) as a\nplug-and-play framework to automatically, personally, and inductively identify\noptimal subgraphs for different edges when performing GNNLP. PS2 is\ninstantiated as a bi-level optimization problem that can be efficiently solved\ndifferently. Coupling GNNLP models with PS2, we suggest a brand-new angle\ntowards GNNLP training: by first identifying the optimal subgraphs for edges;\nand then focusing on training the inference model by using the sampled\nsubgraphs. Comprehensive experiments endorse the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod across various GNNLP backbones (GCN, GraphSage, NGCF, LightGCN, and\nSEAL) and diverse benchmarks (Planetoid, OGB, and Recommendation datasets).

    "abstract": "Prognostication for lung cancer, a leading cause of mortality, remains a\ncomplex task, as it needs to quantify the associations of risk factors and\nhealth events spanning a patient's entire life. One challenge is that an\nindividual's disease course involves non-terminal (e.g., disease progression)\nand terminal (e.g., death) events, which form semi-competing relationships. Our\nmotivation comes from the Boston Lung Cancer Study, a large lung cancer\nsurvival cohort, which investigates how risk factors influence a patient's\ndisease trajectory. Following developments in the prediction of time-to-event\noutcomes with neural networks, deep learning has become a focal area for the\ndevelopment of risk prediction methods in survival analysis. However, limited\nwork has been done to predict multi-state or semi-competing risk outcomes,\nwhere a patient may experience adverse events such as disease progression prior\nto death. We propose a novel neural expectation-maximization algorithm to\nbridge the gap between classical statistical approaches and machine learning.\nOur algorithm enables estimation of the non-parametric baseline hazards of each\nstate transition, risk functions of predictors, and the degree of dependence\namong different transitions, via a multi-task deep neural network with\ntransition-specific sub-architectures. We apply our method to the Boston Lung\nCancer Study and investigate the impact of clinical and genetic predictors on\ndisease progression and mortality.",

The limited\nresolution of additive manufacturing techniques often requires solving such\ninverse problems for specific sizes. One should, therefore, find multiple\nmicroarchitectural designs that exhibit the desired properties for a specimen\nwith given dimensions. Moreover, the candidate microarchitectures should be\nresistant to fatigue and fracture, meaning that peak stresses should be\nminimized as well. Such a multi-objective inverse design problem is formidably\ndifficult to solve but its solution is the key to real-world applications of\nmechanical metamaterials. Here, we propose a modular approach titled\n'Deep-DRAM' that combines four decoupled models, including two deep learning\nmodels (DLM), a deep generative model (DGM) based on conditional variational\nautoencoders (CVAE), and direct finite element (FE) simulations. Deep-DRAM\n(deep learning for the design of random-network metamaterials) integrates these\nmodels into a unified framework capable of finding many solutions to the\nmulti-objective inverse design problem posed here. The integrated framework\nfirst introduces the desired elastic properties to the DGM, which returns a set\nof candidate designs. The candidate designs, together with the target specimen\ndimensions are then passed to the DLM which predicts their actual elastic\nproperties considering the specimen size. After a filtering step based on the\ncloseness of the actual properties to the desired ones, the last step uses\ndirect FE simulations to identify the designs with the minimum peak stresses.",

The advantages of the ACOTS problem are well-known in\nterms of reducing the operational cost and improving system reliability. ACOTS\noptimization models contain discrete variables and nonlinear, non-convex\nstructures, which make it difficult to solve. We derive strengthened quadratic\nconvex (QC) relaxations for ACOTS by combining several methodologies recently\ndeveloped in the ACOPF literature. First, we relax the ACOTS model with the\non/off QC relaxation, which has been empirically observed to be both tight and\ncomputationally efficient in approximating the ACOPF problem. Further, we\ntighten this relaxation by using strong linearization with extreme-point\nrepresentation, and by adding several types of new valid inequalities. In\nparticular, we derive a novel kind of \"on/off cycle-based polynomial\nconstraints\", by taking advantage of the network structure. Those constraints\nare linearized using convex-hull representations and implemented in an\nefficient \"branch-and-cut\" framework. We also tighten the relaxation using the\noptimization-based bound tightening algorithm. Our extensive numerical\nexperiments on medium-scale PGLib instances show that, compared with the\nstate-of-the-art formulations, our strengthening techniques are able to improve\nthe quality of ACOTS relaxations on many of the PGLib instances, with some\nbeing substantial improvements.",

We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player turn-based game, where one player (Alice, a human) guides the other\nplayer (Bob, a machine) towards a common goal. Specifically, we focus on\noffline reinforcement learning (RL) in this game, where the goal is to find a\npolicy pair for Alice and Bob that maximizes their expected total rewards based\non an offline dataset collected a priori. The offline setting presents two\nchallenges: (i) We cannot collect Bob's private information, leading to a\nconfounding bias when using standard RL methods, and (ii) a distributional\nmismatch between the behavior policy used to collect data and the desired\npolicy we aim to learn. To tackle the confounding bias, we treat Bob's previous\naction as an instrumental variable for Alice's current decision making so as to\nadjust for the unmeasured confounding. We develop a novel identification result\nand use it to propose a new off-policy evaluation (OPE) method for evaluating\npolicy pairs in this two-player turn-based game. To tackle the distributional\nmismatch, we leverage the idea of pessimism and use our OPE method to develop\nan off-policy learning algorithm for finding a desirable policy pair for both\nAlice and Bob.

    "abstract": "Image Super-Resolution (SR) is essential for a wide range of computer vision\nand image processing tasks. Investigating infrared (IR) image (or thermal\nimages) super-resolution is a continuing concern within the development of deep\nlearning. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective of IR image\nsuper-resolution, including its applications, hardware imaging system dilemmas,\nand taxonomy of image processing methodologies. In addition, the datasets and\nevaluation metrics in IR image super-resolution tasks are also discussed.\nFurthermore, the deficiencies in current technologies and possible promising\ndirections for the community to explore are highlighted. To cope with the rapid\ndevelopment in this field, we intend to regularly update the relevant excellent\nwork at \\url{https://github.com/yongsongH/Infrared_Image_SR_Survey",

    "title": "Approaching Globally Optimal Energy Efficiency in Interference Networks  via Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "This work presents a machine learning approach to optimize the energy\nefficiency (EE) in a multi-cell wireless network. This optimization problem is\nnon-convex and its global optimum is difficult to find. In the literature,\neither simple but suboptimal approaches or optimal methods with high complexity\nand poor scalability are proposed. In contrast, we propose a machine learning\nframework to approach the global optimum. While the neural network (NN)\ntraining takes moderate time, application with the trained model requires very\nlow computational complexity. In particular, we introduce a novel objective\nfunction based on stochastic actions to solve the non-convex optimization\nproblem. Besides, we design a dedicated NN architecture for the multi-cell\nnetwork optimization problems that is permutation-equivariant. It classifies\nchannels according to their roles in the EE computation. In this way, we encode\nour domain knowledge into the NN design and shed light into the black box of\nmachine learning. Training and testing results show that the proposed method\nwithout supervision and with reasonable computational effort achieves an EE\nclose to the global optimum found by the branch-and-bound algorithm. Hence, the\nproposed approach balances between computational complexity and performance.",

    "abstract": "Applying deep learning concepts from image detection and graph theory has\ngreatly advanced protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, a challenge with\nenormous ramifications for both drug discovery and protein engineering. We\nbuild upon these advances by designing a novel deep learning architecture\nconsisting of a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network utilizing\nchannel-wise attention and two graph convolutional networks utilizing\nattention-based aggregation of node features. HAC-Net (Hybrid Attention-Based\nConvolutional Neural Network) obtains state-of-the-art results on the PDBbind\nv.2016 core set, the most widely recognized benchmark in the field. We\nextensively assess the generalizability of our model using multiple train-test\nsplits, each of which maximizes differences between either protein structures,\nprotein sequences, or ligand extended-connectivity fingerprints. Furthermore,\nwe perform 10-fold cross-validation with a similarity cutoff between SMILES\nstrings of ligands in the training and test sets, and also evaluate the\nperformance of HAC-Net on lower-quality data. We envision that this model can\nbe extended to a broad range of supervised learning problems related to\nstructure-based biomolecular property prediction.

The\ncomplexity of multi-marginal optimal transport generally scales exponentially\nin the number of marginals $m$. We introduce a one parameter family of cost\nfunctions that interpolates between the original and a special cost function\nfor which the problem's complexity scales linearly in $m$. We then show that\nthe solution to the original problem can be recovered by solving an ordinary\ndifferential equation in the parameter $\\epsilon$, whose initial condition\ncorresponds to the solution for the special cost function mentioned above; we\nthen present some simulations, using both explicit Euler and explicit higher\norder Runge-Kutta schemes to compute solutions to the ODE, and, as a result,\nthe multi-marginal optimal transport problem.",

While a variety of statistical tools have been proposed to analyze time\nseries in sound, no consensus has as yet emerged regarding the most meaningful\nmeasure of complexity in music, or how to discern fractal patterns in\ncompositions in the first place. Here we offer a new approach based on\nself-similarity of the melodic lines recurring at various temporal scales. In\ncontrast to the statistical analyses advanced in recent literature, the\nproposed method does not depend on averaging within time-windows and is\ndistinctively local. The corresponding definition of the fractal dimension is\nbased on the temporal scaling hierarchy and depends on the tonal contours of\nthe musical motifs. The new concepts are tested on musical 'renditions' of the\nCantor Set and Koch Curve, and then applied to a number of carefully selected\nmasterful compositions spanning five centuries of music making.",

    "title": "Mathematical Foundations for a Compositional Account of the Bayesian  Brain",
    "abstract": "This dissertation reports some first steps towards a compositional account of\nactive inference and the Bayesian brain. Specifically, we use the tools of\ncontemporary applied category theory to supply functorial semantics for\napproximate inference. To do so, we define on the `syntactic' side the new\nnotion of Bayesian lens and show that Bayesian updating composes according to\nthe compositional lens pattern. Using Bayesian lenses, and inspired by\ncompositional game theory, we define categories of statistical games and use\nthem to classify various problems of statistical inference. On the `semantic'\nside, we present a new formalization of general open dynamical systems\n(particularly: deterministic, stochastic, and random; and discrete- and\ncontinuous-time) as certain coalgebras of polynomial functors, which we show\ncollect into monoidal opindexed categories (or, alternatively, into algebras\nfor multicategories of generalized polynomial functors). We use these opindexed\ncategories to define monoidal bicategories of cilia: dynamical systems which\ncontrol lenses, and which supply the target for our functorial semantics.\nAccordingly, we construct functors which explain the bidirectional\ncompositional structure of predictive coding neural circuits under the free\nenergy principle, thereby giving a formal mathematical underpinning to the\nbidirectionality observed in the cortex. Along the way, we explain how to\ncompose rate-coded neural circuits using an algebra for a multicategory of\nlinear circuit diagrams, showing subsequently that this is subsumed by lenses\nand polynomial functors. Because category theory is unfamiliar to many\ncomputational neuroscientists and cognitive scientists, we have made a\nparticular effort to give clear, detailed, and approachable expositions of all\nthe category-theoretic structures and results of which we make use.",
