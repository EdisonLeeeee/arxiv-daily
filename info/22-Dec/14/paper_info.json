    "abstract": "The ongoing push to send humans back to the Moon and to Mars is giving rise\nto a wide range of novel technical solutions in support of prospective\nastronaut expeditions. Against this backdrop, the European Space Agency (ESA)\nhas recently launched an investigation into unobtrusive interface technologies\nas a potential answer to such challenges. Three particular technologies have\nshown promise in this regard: EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) provide\na non-invasive method of utilizing recorded electrical activity of a user's\nbrain, electromyography (EMG) enables monitoring of electrical signals\ngenerated by the user's muscle contractions, and finally, eye tracking enables,\nfor instance, the tracking of user's gaze direction via camera recordings to\nconvey commands. Beyond simply improving the usability of prospective technical\nsolutions, our findings indicate that EMG, EEG, and eye-tracking could also\nserve to monitor and assess a variety of cognitive states, including attention,\ncognitive load, and mental fatigue of the user, while EMG could furthermore\nalso be utilized to monitor the physical state of the astronaut. In this paper,\nwe elaborate on the key strengths and challenges of these three enabling\ntechnologies, and in light of ESA's latest findings, we reflect on their\napplicability in the context of human space flight. Furthermore, a timeline of\ntechnological readiness is provided. In so doing, this paper feeds into the\ngrowing discourse on emerging technology and its role in paving the way for a\nhuman return to the Moon and expeditions beyond the Earth's orbit.",

    "title": "Fairify: Fairness Verification of Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Fairness of machine learning (ML) software has become a major concern in the\nrecent past. Although recent research on testing and improving fairness have\ndemonstrated impact on real-world software, providing fairness guarantee in\npractice is still lacking. Certification of ML models is challenging because of\nthe complex decision-making process of the models. In this paper, we proposed\nFairify, the first SMT-based approach to verify individual fairness property in\nneural network (NN) models. Individual fairness ensures that any two similar\nindividuals get similar treatment irrespective of their protected attributes\ne.g., race, sex, age. Verifying this fairness property is hard because of its\nglobal nature and the presence of non-linear computation nodes in NN. We\nproposed sound approach to make individual fairness verification tractable for\nthe developers. The key idea is that many neurons in the NN always remain\ninactive when a smaller part of the input domain is considered. So, Fairify\nleverages white-box access to the models in production and then apply formal\nanalysis based pruning. Our approach adopts input partitioning and then prunes\nthe NN for each partition to provide fairness certification or counterexample.\nWe leveraged interval arithmetic and activation heuristic of the neurons to\nperform the pruning as necessary. We evaluated Fairify on 25 real-world neural\nnetworks collected from four different sources, and demonstrated the\neffectiveness, scalability and performance over baseline and closely related\nwork. Fairify is also configurable based on the domain and size of the NN. Our\nnovel formulation of the problem can answer targeted verification queries with\nrelaxations and counterexamples, which have practical implications.",

    "abstract": "Photonic neural network (PNN) is a remarkable analog artificial intelligence\n(AI) accelerator that computes with photons instead of electrons to feature low\nlatency, high energy efficiency, and high parallelism. However, the existing\ntraining approaches cannot address the extensive accumulation of systematic\nerrors in large-scale PNNs, resulting in a significant decrease in model\nperformance in physical systems. Here, we propose dual adaptive training (DAT)\nthat allows the PNN model to adapt to substantial systematic errors and\npreserves its performance during the deployment. By introducing the systematic\nerror prediction networks with task-similarity joint optimization, DAT achieves\nthe high similarity mapping between the PNN numerical models and physical\nsystems and high-accurate gradient calculations during the dual backpropagation\ntraining. We validated the effectiveness of DAT by using diffractive PNNs and\ninterference-based PNNs on image classification tasks. DAT successfully trained\nlarge-scale PNNs under major systematic errors and preserved the model\nclassification accuracies comparable to error-free systems. The results further\ndemonstrated its superior performance over the state-of-the-art in situ\ntraining approaches.

    "abstract": "Long-range time series forecasting is usually based on one of two existing\nforecasting strategies: Direct Forecasting and Iterative Forecasting, where the\nformer provides low bias, high variance forecasts and the latter leads to low\nvariance, high bias forecasts. In this paper, we propose a new forecasting\nstrategy called Generative Forecasting (GenF), which generates synthetic data\nfor the next few time steps and then makes long-range forecasts based on\ngenerated and observed data. We theoretically prove that GenF is able to better\nbalance the forecasting variance and bias, leading to a much smaller\nforecasting error. We implement GenF via three components: (i) a novel\nconditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based generator\nfor synthetic time series data generation, called CWGAN-TS. (ii) a transformer\nbased predictor, which makes long-range predictions using both generated and\nobserved data. (iii) an information theoretic clustering algorithm to improve\nthe training of both the CWGAN-TS and the transformer based predictor. The\nexperimental results on five public datasets demonstrate that GenF\nsignificantly outperforms a diverse range of state-of-the-art benchmarks and\nclassical approaches. Specifically, we find a 5% - 11% improvement in\npredictive performance (mean absolute error) while having a 15% - 50% reduction\nin parameters compared to the benchmarks. Lastly, we conduct an ablation study\nto further explore and demonstrate the effectiveness of the components\ncomprising GenF.",

    "abstract": "Mutual Information (MI) based feature selection makes use of MI to evaluate\neach feature and eventually shortlists a relevant feature subset, in order to\naddress issues associated with high-dimensional datasets. Despite the\neffectiveness of MI in feature selection, we notice that many state-of-the-art\nalgorithms disregard the so-called unique relevance (UR) of features, and\narrive at a suboptimal selected feature subset which contains a non-negligible\nnumber of redundant features. We point out that the heart of the problem is\nthat all these MIBFS algorithms follow the criterion of Maximize Relevance with\nMinimum Redundancy (MRwMR), which does not explicitly target UR. This motivates\nus to augment the existing criterion with the objective of boosting unique\nrelevance (BUR), leading to a new criterion called MRwMR-BUR. Depending on the\ntask being addressed, MRwMR-BUR has two variants, termed MRwMR-BUR-KSG and\nMRwMR-BUR-CLF, which estimate UR differently. MRwMR-BUR-KSG estimates UR via a\nnearest-neighbor based approach called the KSG estimator and is designed for\nthree major tasks: (i) Classification Performance. (ii) Feature\nInterpretability. (iii) Classifier Generalization. MRwMR-BUR-CLF estimates UR\nvia a classifier based approach. It adapts UR to different classifiers, further\nimproving the competitiveness of MRwMR-BUR for classification performance\noriented tasks. The performance of both MRwMR-BUR-KSG and MRwMR-BUR-CLF is\nvalidated via experiments using six public datasets and three popular\nclassifiers. Specifically, as compared to MRwMR, the proposed MRwMR-BUR-KSG\nimproves the test accuracy by 2% - 3% with 25% - 30% fewer features being\nselected, without increasing the algorithm complexity. MRwMR-BUR-CLF further\nimproves the classification performance by 3.8%- 5.5% (relative to MRwMR), and\nit also outperforms three popular classifier dependent feature selection\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "The importance of learning rate (LR) schedules on network pruning has been\nobserved in a few recent works. As an example, Frankle and Carbin (2019)\nhighlighted that winning tickets (i.e., accuracy preserving subnetworks) can\nnot be found without applying a LR warmup schedule and Renda, Frankle and\nCarbin (2020) demonstrated that rewinding the LR to its initial state at the\nend of each pruning cycle improves performance. In this paper, we go one step\nfurther by first providing a theoretical justification for the surprising\neffect of LR schedules. Next, we propose a LR schedule for network pruning\ncalled SILO, which stands for S-shaped Improved Learning rate Optimization. The\nadvantages of SILO over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) LR schedules are\ntwo-fold: (i) SILO has a strong theoretical motivation and dynamically adjusts\nthe LR during pruning to improve generalization. Specifically, SILO increases\nthe LR upper bound (max_lr) in an S-shape. This leads to an improvement of 2% -\n4% in extensive experiments with various types of networks (e.g., Vision\nTransformers, ResNet) on popular datasets such as ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100. (ii)\nIn addition to the strong theoretical motivation, SILO is empirically optimal\nin the sense of matching an Oracle, which exhaustively searches for the optimal\nvalue of max_lr via grid search. We find that SILO is able to precisely adjust\nthe value of max_lr to be within the Oracle optimized interval, resulting in\nperformance competitive with the Oracle with significantly lower complexity.",

    "abstract": "The rectified linear unit (ReLU) is a highly successful activation function\nin neural networks as it allows networks to easily obtain sparse\nrepresentations, which reduces overfitting in overparameterized networks.\nHowever, in network pruning, we find that the sparsity introduced by ReLU,\nwhich we quantify by a term called dynamic dead neuron rate (DNR), is not\nbeneficial for the pruned network. Interestingly, the more the network is\npruned, the smaller the dynamic DNR becomes during optimization. This motivates\nus to propose a method to explicitly reduce the dynamic DNR for the pruned\nnetwork, i.e., de-sparsify the network. We refer to our method as\nActivating-while-Pruning (AP). We note that AP does not function as a\nstand-alone method, as it does not evaluate the importance of weights. Instead,\nit works in tandem with existing pruning methods and aims to improve their\nperformance by selective activation of nodes to reduce the dynamic DNR. We\nconduct extensive experiments using popular networks (e.g., ResNet, VGG) via\ntwo classical and three state-of-the-art pruning methods. The experimental\nresults on public datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10/100) suggest that AP works well with\nexisting pruning methods and improves the performance by 3% - 4%. For larger\nscale datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and state-of-the-art networks (e.g., vision\ntransformer), we observe an improvement of 2% - 3% with AP as opposed to\nwithout.

With an\neffective distance measure, it is possible to perform classification,\nclustering, anomaly detection, segmentation, etc. For single-event time series\nEuclidean Distance and Dynamic Time Warping distance are known to be extremely\neffective. However, for time series containing cyclical behaviors, the semantic\nmeaningfulness of such comparisons is less clear. For example, on two separate\ndays the telemetry from an athlete workout routine might be very similar. The\nsecond day may change the order in of performing push-ups and squats, adding\nrepetitions of pull-ups, or completely omitting dumbbell curls. Any of these\nminor changes would defeat existing time series distance measures. Some\nbag-of-features methods have been proposed to address this problem, but we\nargue that in many cases, similarity is intimately tied to the shapes of\nsubsequences within these longer time series. In such cases, summative features\nwill lack discrimination ability. In this work we introduce PRCIS, which stands\nfor Pattern Representation Comparison in Series.

    "abstract": "Continuous long-term monitoring of motor health is crucial for the early\ndetection of abnormalities such as bearing faults (up to 51% of motor failures\nare attributed to bearing faults). Despite numerous methodologies proposed for\nbearing fault detection, most of them require normal (healthy) and abnormal\n(faulty) data for training. Even with the recent deep learning (DL)\nmethodologies trained on the labeled data from the same machine, the\nclassification accuracy significantly deteriorates when one or few conditions\nare altered. Furthermore, their performance suffers significantly or may\nentirely fail when they are tested on another machine with entirely different\nhealthy and faulty signal patterns. To address this need, in this pilot study,\nwe propose a zero-shot bearing fault detection method that can detect any fault\non a new (target) machine regardless of the working conditions, sensor\nparameters, or fault characteristics. To accomplish this objective, a 1D\nOperational Generative Adversarial Network (Op-GAN) first characterizes the\ntransition between normal and fault vibration signals of (a) source machine(s)\nunder various conditions, sensor parameters, and fault types. Then for a target\nmachine, the potential faulty signals can be generated, and over its actual\nhealthy and synthesized faulty signals, a compact, and lightweight 1D Self-ONN\nfault detector can then be trained to detect the real faulty condition in real\ntime whenever it occurs. To validate the proposed approach, a new benchmark\ndataset is created using two different motors working under different\nconditions and sensor locations. Experimental results demonstrate that this\nnovel approach can accurately detect any bearing fault achieving an average\nrecall rate of around 89% and 95% on two target machines regardless of its\ntype, severity, and location.",

    "title": "\"Hey, Can You Add Captions?\": The Critical Infrastructuring Practices of  Neurodiverse People on TikTok",
    "abstract": "Accessibility efforts, how we can make the world usable and useful to as many\npeople as possible, have explicitly focused on how we can support and allow for\nthe autonomy and independence of people with disabilities, neurotypes, chronic\nconditions, and older adults. Despite these efforts, not all technology is\ndesigned or implemented to support everyone's needs. Recently, a\ncommunity-organized push by creators and general users of TikTok urged the\nplatform to add accessibility features, such as closed captioning to\nuser-generated content, allowing more people to use the platform with greater\nease. Our work focuses on an understudied population -- people with ADHD and\nthose who experience similar challenges -- exploring the creative practices\npeople from this community engage in, focusing on the kinds of accessibility\nthey create through their creative work. Through an interview study exploring\nthe experiences of creatives on TikTok, we find that creatives engage in\ncritical infrastructuring -- a process of bottom-up (re)design -- to make the\nplatform more accessible despite the challenges the platform presents to them\nas creators. We present these critical infrastructuring practices through the\nthemes of: creating and augmenting video editing infrastructures and creating\nand augmenting video captioning infrastructures. We reflect on the introduction\nof a top-down infrastructure - the implementation of an auto-captioning feature\n- shifts the critical infrastructure practices of content creators. Through\ntheir infrastructuring, creatives revised sociotechnical capabilities of TikTok\nto support their own needs as well as the broader needs of the TikTok\ncommunity. We discuss how the routine of infrastructuring accessibility is\nactually best conceptualized as incidental care work. We further highlight how\naccessibility is an evolving sociotechnical construct, and forward the concept\nof contextual accessibility.",

    "title": "Contextual Explainable Video Representation:\\\\Human Perception-based  Understanding",
    "abstract": "Video understanding is a growing field and a subject of intense research,\nwhich includes many interesting tasks to understanding both spatial and\ntemporal information, e.g., action detection, action recognition, video\ncaptioning, video retrieval. One of the most challenging problems in video\nunderstanding is dealing with feature extraction, i.e. extract contextual\nvisual representation from given untrimmed video due to the long and\ncomplicated temporal structure of unconstrained videos. Different from existing\napproaches, which apply a pre-trained backbone network as a black-box to\nextract visual representation, our approach aims to extract the most contextual\ninformation with an explainable mechanism. As we observed, humans typically\nperceive a video through the interactions between three main factors, i.e., the\nactors, the relevant objects, and the surrounding environment. Therefore, it is\nvery crucial to design a contextual explainable video representation extraction\nthat can capture each of such factors and model the relationships between them.\nIn this paper, we discuss approaches, that incorporate the human perception\nprocess into modeling actors, objects, and the environment. We choose video\nparagraph captioning and temporal action detection to illustrate the\neffectiveness of human perception based-contextual representation in video\nunderstanding.

The\nunder-representation of vulnerable groups in today's pedestrian datasets points\nto an urgent need for a dataset of vulnerable road users. In this paper, we\nfirst introduce a new vulnerable pedestrian detection dataset, BG Vulnerable\nPedestrian (BGVP) dataset to help train well-rounded models and thus induce\nresearch to increase the efficacy of vulnerable pedestrian detection. The\ndataset includes four classes, i.e., Children Without Disability, Elderly\nwithout Disability, With Disability, and Non-Vulnerable. This dataset consists\nof images collected from the public domain and manually-annotated bounding\nboxes. In addition, on the proposed dataset, we have trained and tested five\nstate-of-the-art object detection models, i.e., YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOX, Faster\nR-CNN, and EfficientDet. Our results indicate that YOLOX and YOLOv4 perform the\nbest on our dataset, YOLOv4 scoring 0.7999 and YOLOX scoring 0.7779 on the mAP\n0.5 metric, while YOLOX outperforms YOLOv4 by 3.8 percent on the mAP 0.5:0.95\nmetric. Generally speaking, all five detectors do well predicting the With\nDisability class and perform poorly in the Elderly Without Disability class.\nYOLOX consistently outperforms all other detectors on the mAP (0.5:0.95) per\nclass metric, obtaining 0.5644, 0.5242, 0.4781, and 0.6796 for Children Without\nDisability, Elderly Without Disability, Non-vulnerable, and With Disability,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "Many policies in the US are determined locally, e.g., at the county-level.\nLocal policy regimes provide flexibility between regions, but may become less\neffective in the presence of geographic spillovers, where populations\ncircumvent local restrictions by traveling to less restricted regions nearby.\nDue to the endogenous nature of policymaking, there have been few opportunities\nto reliably estimate causal spillover effects or evaluate their impact on local\npolicies. In this work, we identify a novel setting and develop a suitable\nmethodology that allow us to make unconfounded estimates of spillover effects\nof local policies. Focusing on California's Blueprint for a Safer Economy, we\nleverage how county-level mobility restrictions were deterministically set by\npublic COVID-19 severity statistics, enabling a regression discontinuity design\nframework to estimate spillovers between counties. We estimate these effects\nusing a mobility network with billions of timestamped edges and find\nsignificant spillover movement, with larger effects in retail, eating places,\nand gyms. Contrasting local and global policy regimes, our spillover estimates\nsuggest that county-level restrictions are only 54% as effective as statewide\nrestrictions at reducing mobility. However, an intermediate strategy of\nmacro-county restrictions -- where we optimize county partitions by solving a\nminimum k-cut problem on a graph weighted by our spillover estimates -- can\nrecover over 90% of statewide mobility reductions, while maintaining\nsubstantial flexibility between counties.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of improving the human instance segmentation mask\nquality for a given test image using keypoints estimation. We compare two\nalternative approaches. The first approach is a test-time adaptation (TTA)\nmethod, where we allow test-time modification of the segmentation network's\nweights using a single unlabeled test image. In this approach, we do not assume\ntest-time access to the labeled source dataset. More specifically, our TTA\nmethod consists of using the keypoints estimates as pseudo labels and\nbackpropagating them to adjust the backbone weights. The second approach is a\ntraining-time generalization (TTG) method, where we permit offline access to\nthe labeled source dataset but not the test-time modification of weights.\nFurthermore, we do not assume the availability of any images from or knowledge\nabout the target domain. Our TTG method consists of augmenting the backbone\nfeatures with those generated by the keypoints head and feeding the aggregate\nvector to the mask head. Through a comprehensive set of ablations, we evaluate\nboth approaches and identify several factors limiting the TTA gains. In\nparticular, we show that in the absence of a significant domain shift, TTA may\nhurt and TTG show only a small gain in performance, whereas for a large domain\nshift, TTA gains are smaller and dependent on the heuristics used, while TTG\ngains are larger and robust to architectural choices.",

While most existing\nmethods focus on fusing camera features directly with raw LiDAR point clouds or\nshallow 3D features, it is observed that direct deep 3D feature fusion achieves\ninferior accuracy due to feature misalignment. The misalignment that originates\nfrom the feature aggregation across large receptive fields becomes increasingly\nsevere for deep network stages. In this paper, we propose PathFusion to enable\npath-consistent LiDAR-camera deep feature fusion. PathFusion introduces a path\nconsistency loss between shallow and deep features, which encourages the 2D\nbackbone and its fusion path to transform 2D features in a way that is\nsemantically aligned with the transform of the 3D backbone. We apply PathFusion\nto the prior-art fusion baseline, Focals Conv, and observe more than 1.2\\% mAP\nimprovements on the nuScenes test split consistently with and without\ntesting-time augmentations.

Specifically, our Scan Entities in 3D (ScanEnts3D) dataset\nprovides explicit correspondences between 369k objects across 84k natural\nreferential sentences, covering 705 real-world scenes. Crucially, we show that\nby incorporating intuitive losses that enable learning from this novel dataset,\nwe can significantly improve the performance of several recently introduced\nneural listening architectures, including improving the SoTA in both the Nr3D\nand ScanRefer benchmarks by 4.3% and 5.0%, respectively.

In this paper, we show that we can\nachieve up to 90\\% accuracy without using any sub-group information in the\ntraining set by simply using embeddings from a large pre-trained vision model\nextractor and training a linear classifier on top of it. With experiments on a\nwide range of pre-trained models and pre-training datasets, we show that the\ncapacity of the pre-training model and the size of the pre-training dataset\nmatters. Our experiments reveal that high capacity vision transformers perform\nbetter compared to high capacity convolutional neural networks, and larger\npre-training dataset leads to better worst-group accuracy on the spurious\ncorrelation dataset.",

    "abstract": "Transferring composite data structures with variable-length fields often\nrequires designing non-trivial protocols that are not compatible between\nhardware designs. When each project designs its own data format and protocols\nthe ability to collaborate between hardware developers is diminished, which is\nan issue especially in the open-source community. Because the high-level\nmeaning of a protocol is often lost in translation to low-level languages when\na custom protocol needs to be designed, extra documentation is required, the\ninterpretation of which introduces new opportunities for errors.\nThe Tydi specification (Tydi-spec) was proposed to address the above issues\nby codifying the composite and variable-length data structures in a type and\nproviding a standard protocol to transfer typed data among hardware components.\nThe Tydi intermediate representation (Tydi-IR) extends the Tydi-spec by\ndefining typed interfaces, typed components, and connections among typed\ncomponents.\nIn this paper, we propose Tydi-lang, a high-level hardware description\nlanguage (HDL) for streaming designs. The language incorporates Tydi-spec to\ndescribe typed streams and provides templates to describe abstract reusable\ncomponents. We also implement an open-source compiler from Tydi-lang to\nTydi-IR. We leverage a Tydi-IR to VHDL compiler, and also present a simulator\nblueprint to identify streaming bottlenecks. We show several Tydi-lang examples\nto translate high-level SQL to VHDL to demonstrate that Tydi-lang can\nefficiently raise the level of abstraction and reduce design effort.",

State-of-the-art recommendation models\nrely on sparse and dense features to represent users' profile information and\nthe items they interact with. Although sparse features account for 99% of the\ntotal model size, there was not enough attention paid to the potential\ninformation leakage through sparse features. These sparse features are employed\nto track users' behavior, e.g., their click history, object interactions, etc.,\npotentially carrying each user's private information. Sparse features are\nrepresented as learned embedding vectors that are stored in large tables, and\npersonalized recommendation is performed by using a specific user's sparse\nfeature to index through the tables. Even with recently-proposed methods that\nhides the computation happening in the cloud, an attacker in the cloud may be\nable to still track the access patterns to the embedding tables.

As the early-stage\nmanifestation of DR is usually very mild and hard to detect, an accurate\ndiagnosis via eye-screening is clinically important to prevent vision loss at\nlater stages. In this work, we propose an ensemble method to automatically\ngrade DR using ultra-wide optical coherence tomography angiography (UW-OCTA)\nimages available from Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis Challenge (DRAC) 2022.\nFirst, we adopt the state-of-the-art classification networks, i.e., ResNet,\nDenseNet, EfficientNet, and VGG, and train them to grade UW-OCTA images with\ndifferent splits of the available dataset. Ultimately, we obtain 25 models, of\nwhich, the top 16 models are selected and ensembled to generate the final\npredictions. During the training process, we also investigate the multi-task\nlearning strategy, and add an auxiliary classification task, the Image Quality\nAssessment, to improve the model performance. Our final ensemble model achieved\na quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) of 0.9346 and an Area Under Curve (AUC) of\n0.9766 on the internal testing dataset, and the QWK of 0.839 and the AUC of\n0.8978 on the DRAC challenge testing dataset.",

Examples of these networks include smart home networks, wireless\nsensor networks, Internet of Flying Things, and many others. One of the main\ndifficulties that confront these networks is the security of their information\nand communications. A large number of solutions have been proposed to safeguard\nthese networks from various types of cyberattacks. Among these solutions is the\nblockchain, which gained popularity in the last few years due to its strong\nsecurity characteristics, such as immutability, cryptography, and distributed\nconsensus. However, implementing the blockchain framework within the devices of\nthese networks is very challenging, due to the limited resources of these\ndevices and the resource-demanding requirements of the blockchain. For this\nreason, a large number of researchers proposed various types of lightweight\nblockchain solutions for resource-constrained networks. The \"lightweight\"\naspect can be related to the blockchain architecture, device authentication,\ncryptography model, consensus algorithm, or storage method. In this paper, we\npresent a taxonomy of the lightweight blockchain solutions that have been\nproposed in the literature and discuss the different methods that have been\napplied so far in each \"lightweight\" category. Our review highlights the\nmissing points in existing systems and paves the way to building a complete\nlightweight blockchain solution for resource-constrained networks.",

It is widely considered as the\nmodel of choice and a strong baseline for medical image segmentation. However,\ndespite its extraordinary performance, nnU-Net does not supply a measure of\nuncertainty to indicate its possible failure. This can be problematic for\nlarge-scale image segmentation applications, where data are heterogeneous and\nnnU-Net may fail without notice. In this work, we introduce a novel method to\nestimate nnU-Net uncertainty for medical image segmentation. We propose a\nhighly effective scheme for posterior sampling of weight space for Bayesian\nuncertainty estimation. Different from previous baseline methods such as Monte\nCarlo Dropout and mean-field Bayesian Neural Networks, our proposed method does\nnot require a variational architecture and keeps the original nnU-Net\narchitecture intact, thereby preserving its excellent performance and ease of\nuse. Additionally, we boost the segmentation performance over the original\nnnU-Net via marginalizing multi-modal posterior models.

Most research\nfor this problem focuses exclusively on the settings that players have\n\\textit{full access} to all arms and receive no reward when pulling the same\narm. Hence all players solve the same bandit problem with the goal of\nmaximizing their cumulative reward. However, these settings neglect several\nimportant factors in many real-world applications, where players have\n\\textit{limited access} to \\textit{a dynamic local subset of arms} (i.e., an\narm could sometimes be ``walking'' and not accessible to the player). To this\nend, this paper proposes a \\textit{multi-player multi-armed walking bandits}\nmodel, aiming to address aforementioned modeling issues. The goal now is to\nmaximize the reward, however, players can only pull arms from the local subset\nand only collect a full reward if no other players pull the same arm. We adopt\nUpper Confidence Bound (UCB) to deal with the exploration-exploitation tradeoff\nand employ distributed optimization techniques to properly handle collisions.\nBy carefully integrating these two techniques, we propose a decentralized\nalgorithm with near-optimal guarantee on the regret, and can be easily\nimplemented to obtain competitive empirical performance.",

    "abstract": "Partitioning applications between NDP and host CPU cores causes inter-segment\ndata movement overhead, which is caused by moving data generated from one\nsegment (e.g., instructions, functions) and used in consecutive segments. Prior\nworks take two approaches to this problem. The first class of works maps\nsegments to NDP or host cores based on the properties of each segment,\nneglecting the inter-segment data movement overhead. The second class of works\npartitions applications based on the overall memory bandwidth saving of each\nsegment, and does not offload each segment to the best-fitting core if they\nincur high inter-segment data movement. We show that 1) mapping each segment to\nits best-fitting core ideally can provide substantial benefits, and 2) the\ninter-segment data movement reduces this benefit significantly.\nTo this end, we introduce ALP, a new programmer-transparent technique to\nleverage the performance benefits of NDP by alleviating the inter-segment data\nmovement overhead between host and memory and enabling efficient partitioning\nof applications. ALP alleviates the inter-segment data movement overhead by\nproactively and accurately transferring the required data between the segments.\nThis is based on the key observation that the instructions that generate the\ninter-segment data stay the same across different executions of a program on\ndifferent inputs. ALP uses a compiler pass to identify these instructions and\nuses specialized hardware to transfer data between the host and NDP cores at\nruntime. ALP efficiently maps application segments to either host or NDP\nconsidering 1) the properties of each segment, 2) the inter-segment data\nmovement overhead, and 3) whether this overhead can be alleviated in a timely\nmanner.

Under such a\nparadigm, Cyber-Physical Human-centered Systems (CPHSs) have emerged to\nleverage operator capabilities in order to meet the goals of complex\nmanufacturing systems towards human-centricity, resilience and sustainability.\nThis article first describes the essential concepts for the development of\nIndustry 5.0 CPHSs and then analyzes the latest CPHSs, identifying their main\ndesign requirements and key implementation components. Moreover, the major\nchallenges for the development of such CPHSs are outlined. Next, to illustrate\nthe previously described concepts, a real-world Industry 5.0 CPHS is presented.\nSuch a CPHS enables increased operator safety and operation tracking in\nmanufacturing processes that rely on collaborative robots and heavy machinery.\nSpecifically, the proposed use case consists of a workshop where a smarter use\nof resources is required, and human proximity detection determines when\nmachinery should be working or not in order to avoid incidents or accidents\ninvolving such machinery. The proposed CPHS makes use of a hybrid edge\ncomputing architecture with smart mist computing nodes that processes thermal\nimages and reacts to prevent industrial safety issues. The performed\nexperiments show that, in the selected real-world scenario, the developed CPHS\nalgorithms are able to detect human presence with low-power devices (with a\nRaspberry Pi 3B) in a fast and accurate way (in less than 10 ms with a 97.04%\naccuracy), thus being an effective solution that can be integrated into many\nIndustry 5.0 applications. Finally, this article provides specific guidelines\nthat will help future developers and managers to overcome the challenges that\nwill arise when deploying the next generation of CPHSs for smart and\nsustainable manufacturing.",

Such videos are prevalent in practice (e.g., cars in roundabouts,\nairplanes near runways) and easy to collect. We show that classical\nstructure-from-motion algorithms, coupled with the recent advances in instance\ndetection and feature matching, provides surprisingly accurate relative 3D pose\nestimation on such videos. We propose a multi-stage training scheme that first\nlearns a canonical pose across a collection of videos and then supervises a\nmodel for single-view pose estimation. The proposed technique achieves\ncompetitive performance with respect to existing state-of-the-art on standard\nbenchmarks for 3D pose estimation, without requiring any pose labels during\ntraining. We also contribute an Accidental Turntables Dataset, containing a\nchallenging set of 41,212 images of cars in cluttered backgrounds, motion blur\nand illumination changes that serves as a benchmark for 3D pose estimation.",

We argue that this calls for\na much more unified approach. We propose EgoTask Translation (EgoT2), which\ntakes a collection of models optimized on separate tasks and learns to\ntranslate their outputs for improved performance on any or all of them at once.\nUnlike traditional transfer or multi-task learning, EgoT2's flipped design\nentails separate task-specific backbones and a task translator shared across\nall tasks, which captures synergies between even heterogeneous tasks and\nmitigates task competition. Demonstrating our model on a wide array of video\ntasks from Ego4D, we show its advantages over existing transfer paradigms and\nachieve top-ranked results on four of the Ego4D 2022 benchmark challenges.",

While such a task enables many\npractical applications for interactive editing, existing methods often struggle\nto hallucinate realistic object instances in complex natural scenes.

In this work, we propose a learning paradigm that consists of\nsemantic discriminators and object-level discriminators for improving the\ngeneration of complex semantics and objects.

However, in realistic policy-making contexts,\ndecision-makers often care about trade-offs between outcomes, not just\nsinglemindedly maximising utility for one outcome. This paper proposes an\napproach termed Multi-Objective Policy Learning (MOPoL) which combines optimal\ndecision trees for policy learning with a multi-objective Bayesian optimisation\napproach to explore the trade-off between multiple outcomes. It does this by\nbuilding a Pareto frontier of non-dominated models for different hyperparameter\nsettings. The key here is that a low-cost surrogate function can be an accurate\nproxy for the very computationally costly optimal tree in terms of expected\nregret. This surrogate can be fit many times with different hyperparameter\nvalues to proxy the performance of the optimal model. The method is applied to\na real-world case-study of conditional cash transfers in Morocco where hybrid\n(partially optimal, partially greedy) policy trees provide good performance as\na surrogate for optimal trees while being computationally cheap enough to\nfeasibly fit a Pareto frontier.",

    "abstract": "The JPEG standard is widely used in different image processing applications.\nOne of the main components of the JPEG standard is the quantisation table (QT)\nsince it plays a vital role in the image properties such as image quality and\nfile size. In recent years, several efforts based on population-based\nmetaheuristic (PBMH) algorithms have been performed to find the proper QT(s)\nfor a specific image, although they do not take into consideration the user's\nopinion. Take an android developer as an example, who prefers a small-size\nimage, while the optimisation process results in a high-quality image, leading\nto a huge file size. Another pitfall of the current works is a lack of\ncomprehensive coverage, meaning that the QT(s) can not provide all possible\ncombinations of file size and quality. Therefore, this paper aims to propose\nthree distinct contributions. First, to include the user's opinion in the\ncompression process, the file size of the output image can be controlled by a\nuser in advance. Second, to tackle the lack of comprehensive coverage, we\nsuggest a novel representation. Our proposed representation can not only\nprovide more comprehensive coverage but also find the proper value for the\nquality factor for a specific image without any background knowledge. Both\nchanges in representation and objective function are independent of the search\nstrategies and can be used with any type of population-based metaheuristic\n(PBMH) algorithm. Therefore, as the third contribution, we also provide a\ncomprehensive benchmark on 22 state-of-the-art and recently-introduced PBMH\nalgorithms on our new formulation of JPEG image compression. Our extensive\nexperiments on different benchmark images and in terms of different criteria\nshow that our novel formulation for JPEG image compression can work\neffectively.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning paradigm, in which\nclients jointly learn a model with the help of a cloud server. A fundamental\nchallenge of FL is that the clients are often heterogeneous, e.g., they have\ndifferent computing powers, and thus the clients may send model updates to the\nserver with substantially different delays. Asynchronous FL aims to address\nthis challenge by enabling the server to update the model once any client's\nmodel update reaches it without waiting for other clients' model updates.\nHowever, like synchronous FL, asynchronous FL is also vulnerable to poisoning\nattacks, in which malicious clients manipulate the model via poisoning their\nlocal data and/or model updates sent to the server. Byzantine-robust FL aims to\ndefend against poisoning attacks. In particular, Byzantine-robust FL can learn\nan accurate model even if some clients are malicious and have Byzantine\nbehaviors. However, most existing studies on Byzantine-robust FL focused on\nsynchronous FL, leaving asynchronous FL largely unexplored. In this work, we\nbridge this gap by proposing AFLGuard, a Byzantine-robust asynchronous FL\nmethod.

    "abstract": "Global pooling is one of the most significant operations in many machine\nlearning models and tasks, which works for information fusion and structured\ndata (like sets and graphs) representation. However, without solid mathematical\nfundamentals, its practical implementations often depend on empirical\nmechanisms and thus lead to sub-optimal, even unsatisfactory performance. In\nthis work, we develop a novel and generalized global pooling framework through\nthe lens of optimal transport. The proposed framework is interpretable from the\nperspective of expectation-maximization. Essentially, it aims at learning an\noptimal transport across sample indices and feature dimensions, making the\ncorresponding pooling operation maximize the conditional expectation of input\ndata. We demonstrate that most existing pooling methods are equivalent to\nsolving a regularized optimal transport (ROT) problem with different\nspecializations, and more sophisticated pooling operations can be implemented\nby hierarchically solving multiple ROT problems. Making the parameters of the\nROT problem learnable, we develop a family of regularized optimal transport\npooling (ROTP) layers. We implement the ROTP layers as a new kind of deep\nimplicit layer. Their model architectures correspond to different optimization\nalgorithms. We test our ROTP layers in several representative set-level machine\nlearning scenarios, including multi-instance learning (MIL), graph\nclassification, graph set representation, and image classification.\nExperimental results show that applying our ROTP layers can reduce the\ndifficulty of the design and selection of global pooling -- our ROTP layers may\neither imitate some existing global pooling methods or lead to some new pooling\nlayers fitting data better.

The motivation for\nour framework is driven by interactive workflows used for decaling, texturing,\nor painting on surfaces. Our key idea is to incorporate segmentation\nprobabilities as weights of a classical parameterization method, implemented as\na novel differentiable parameterization layer within a neural network\nframework. We train a segmentation network to select 3D regions that are\nparameterized into 2D and penalized by the resulting distortion, giving rise to\nsegmentations which are distortion-aware. Following training, a user can use\nour system to interactively select a point on the mesh and obtain a large,\nmeaningful region around the selection which induces a low-distortion\nparameterization.

    "abstract": "Deep neural operators can learn nonlinear mappings between\ninfinite-dimensional function spaces via deep neural networks. As promising\nsurrogate solvers of partial differential equations (PDEs) for real-time\nprediction, deep neural operators such as deep operator networks (DeepONets)\nprovide a new simulation paradigm in science and engineering. Pure data-driven\nneural operators and deep learning models, in general, are usually limited to\ninterpolation scenarios, where new predictions utilize inputs within the\nsupport of the training set. However, in the inference stage of real-world\napplications, the input may lie outside the support, i.e., extrapolation is\nrequired, which may result to large errors and unavoidable failure of deep\nlearning models. Here, we address this challenge of extrapolation for deep\nneural operators. First, we systematically investigate the extrapolation\nbehavior of DeepONets by quantifying the extrapolation complexity via the\n2-Wasserstein distance between two function spaces and propose a new behavior\nof bias-variance trade-off for extrapolation with respect to model capacity.\nSubsequently, we develop a complete workflow, including extrapolation\ndetermination, and we propose five reliable learning methods that guarantee a\nsafe prediction under extrapolation by requiring additional information -- the\ngoverning PDEs of the system or sparse new observations. The proposed methods\nare based on either fine-tuning a pre-trained DeepONet or multifidelity\nlearning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for\nvarious types of parametric PDEs. Our systematic comparisons provide practical\nguidelines for selecting a proper extrapolation method depending on the\navailable information, desired accuracy, and required inference speed.",

    "abstract": "To balance the annotation labor and the granularity of supervision,\nsingle-frame annotation has been introduced in temporal action localization. It\nprovides a rough temporal location for an action but implicitly overstates the\nsupervision from the annotated-frame during training, leading to the confusion\nbetween actions and backgrounds, i.e., action incompleteness and background\nfalse positives. To tackle the two challenges, in this work, we present the\nSnippet Classification model and the Dilation-Erosion module. In the\nDilation-Erosion module, we expand the potential action segments with a loose\ncriterion to alleviate the problem of action incompleteness and then remove the\nbackground from the potential action segments to alleviate the problem of\naction incompleteness. Relying on the single-frame annotation and the output of\nthe snippet classification, the Dilation-Erosion module mines pseudo\nsnippet-level ground-truth, hard backgrounds and evident backgrounds, which in\nturn further trains the Snippet Classification model. It forms a cyclic\ndependency. Furthermore, we propose a new embedding loss to aggregate the\nfeatures of action instances with the same label and separate the features of\nactions from backgrounds.

We name it REC-MARL standing for REward-Coupled Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning. REC-MARL has a range of important applications such as\nreal-time access control and distributed power control in wireless networks.\nThis paper presents a distributed and optimal policy gradient algorithm for\nREC-MARL. The proposed algorithm is distributed in two aspects: (i) the learned\npolicy is a distributed policy that maps a local state of an agent to its local\naction and (ii) the learning/training is distributed, during which each agent\nupdates its policy based on its own and neighbors' information. The learned\npolicy is provably optimal among all local policies and its regret bounds\ndepend on the dimension of local states and actions. This distinguishes our\nresult from most existing results on MARL, which often obtain stationary-point\npolicies.

While originally applied to computer vision tasks, CNNs work well\nwith any data with a spatial relationship, besides images, and have been\napplied to different fields. However, recent works have highlighted how CNNs,\nlike other deep learning models, are sensitive to noise injection which can\njeopardise their performance. This paper quantifies the numerical uncertainty\nof the floating point arithmetic inaccuracies of the inference stage of\nDeepGOPlus, a CNN that predicts protein function, in order to determine its\nnumerical stability. In addition, this paper investigates the possibility to\nuse reduced-precision floating point formats for DeepGOPlus inference to reduce\nmemory consumption and latency. This is achieved with Monte Carlo Arithmetic, a\ntechnique that experimentally quantifies floating point operation errors and\nVPREC, a tool that emulates results with customizable floating point precision\nformats. Focus is placed on the inference stage as it is the main deliverable\nof the DeepGOPlus model that will be used across environments and therefore\nmost likely be subjected to the most amount of noise. Furthermore, studies have\nshown that the inference stage is the part of the model which is most disposed\nto being scaled down in terms of reduced precision. All in all, it has been\nfound that the numerical uncertainty of the DeepGOPlus CNN is very low at its\ncurrent numerical precision format, but the model cannot currently be reduced\nto a lower precision that might render it more lightweight.",

Our empirical evaluation using 130\nreal-world BICs shows that Fonte significantly outperforms state-of-the-art BIC\nidentification techniques based on Information Retrieval as well as neural code\nembedding models, achieving at least 39% higher MRR. We also report that the\nranking scores produced by Fonte can be used to perform weighted bisection,\nfurther reducing the cost of BIC identification. Finally, we apply Fonte to a\nlarge-scale industry project with over 10M lines of code, and show that it can\nrank the actual BIC within the top five commits for 87% of the studied real\nbatch-testing failures, and save the BIC inspection cost by 32% on average.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated\nthe capabilities of generating stunning photo-realistic portrait images. While\nsome prior works have applied such image GANs to unconditional 2D portrait\nvideo generation and static 3D portrait synthesis, there are few works\nsuccessfully extending GANs for generating 3D-aware portrait videos. In this\nwork, we propose PV3D, the first generative framework that can synthesize\nmulti-view consistent portrait videos. Specifically, our method extends the\nrecent static 3D-aware image GAN to the video domain by generalizing the 3D\nimplicit neural representation to model the spatio-temporal space. To introduce\nmotion dynamics to the generation process, we develop a motion generator by\nstacking multiple motion layers to generate motion features via modulated\nconvolution. To alleviate motion ambiguities caused by camera/human motions, we\npropose a simple yet effective camera condition strategy for PV3D, enabling\nboth temporal and multi-view consistent video generation. Moreover, PV3D\nintroduces two discriminators for regularizing the spatial and temporal domains\nto ensure the plausibility of the generated portrait videos. These elaborated\ndesigns enable PV3D to generate 3D-aware motion-plausible portrait videos with\nhigh-quality appearance and geometry, significantly outperforming prior works.\nAs a result, PV3D is able to support many downstream applications such as\nanimating static portraits and view-consistent video motion editing.

Our algorithm is a\nsource-to-source program transformation on an expressive, higher-order language\nfor probabilistic computation, with both discrete and continuous probability\ndistributions. The result of our transformation is a new probabilistic program,\nwhose expected return value is the derivative of the original program's\nexpectation.

We prove ADEV correct using logical relations\nover the denotations of the source and target probabilistic programs.

To\nthis end, we first propose a state-of-the-art phoneme boundary detector that\noperates in an autoregressive manner, dubbed SuperSeg. Experiments on the TIMIT\nand Buckeye corpora demonstrates that SuperSeg identifies phoneme boundaries\nwith significant margin compared to existing models.

The proposed metrics reveal the weaknesses of\nnon-autoregressive baselines and establishes a reliable criterion that suits\nfor evaluating phoneme boundary detection.",

    "abstract": "Visually impaired people usually find it hard to travel independently in many\npublic places such as airports and shopping malls due to the problems of\nobstacle avoidance and guidance to the desired location. Therefore, in the\nhighly dynamic indoor environment, how to improve indoor navigation robot\nlocalization and navigation accuracy so that they guide the visually impaired\nwell becomes a problem. One way is to use visual SLAM. However, typical visual\nSLAM either assumes a static environment, which may lead to less accurate\nresults in dynamic environments or assumes that the targets are all dynamic and\nremoves all the feature points above, sacrificing computational speed to a\nlarge extent with the available computational power. This paper seeks to\nexplore marginal localization and navigation systems for indoor navigation\nrobotics. The proposed system is designed to improve localization and\nnavigation accuracy in highly dynamic environments by identifying and tracking\npotentially moving objects and using vector field histograms for local path\nplanning and obstacle avoidance. The system has been tested on a public indoor\nRGB-D dataset, and the results show that the new system improves accuracy and\nrobustness while reducing computation time in highly dynamic indoor scenes.",

These benefits are\nparticularly important in high-velocity vehicular platoons since their high\nDoppler affects the estimation accuracy of the CSIT. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose an RSMA-based Internet of Vehicles (IoV) solution that jointly\nconsiders platoon control and FEderated Edge Learning (FEEL) in the downlink.\nSpecifically, the proposed framework is designed for transmitting the unicast\ncontrol messages within the IoV platoon, as well as for privacy-preserving\nFEEL-aided downlink Non-Orthogonal Unicasting and Multicasting (NOUM). Given\nthis sophisticated framework, a multi-objective optimization problem is\nformulated to minimize both the latency of the FEEL downlink and the deviation\nof the vehicles within the platoon. To efficiently solve this problem, a Block\nCoordinate Descent (BCD) framework is developed for decoupling the main\nmulti-objective problem into two sub-problems. Then, for solving these\nnon-convex sub-problems, a Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) and Model\nPredictive Control (MPC) method is developed for solving the FEEL-based\ndownlink problem and platoon control problem, respectively.

To\nachieve intelligent teaching, the machine learning community becomes to think\nabout a promising topic named machine teaching where the teacher is to design\nthe optimal (usually minimal) teaching set given a target model and a specific\nlearner. However, previous works usually require numerous teaching examples\nalong with large iterations to guide learners to converge, which is costly. In\nthis paper, we consider a more intelligent teaching paradigm named one-shot\nmachine teaching which costs fewer examples to converge faster. Different from\ntypical teaching, this advanced paradigm establishes a tractable mapping from\nthe teaching set to the model parameter. Theoretically, we prove that this\nmapping is surjective, which serves to an existence guarantee of the optimal\nteaching set. Then, relying on the surjective mapping from the teaching set to\nthe parameter, we develop a design strategy of the optimal teaching set under\nappropriate settings, of which two popular efficiency metrics, teaching\ndimension and iterative teaching dimension are one. Extensive experiments\nverify the efficiency of our strategy and further demonstrate the intelligence\nof this new teaching paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Traffic forecasting has attracted widespread attention recently. In reality,\ntraffic data usually contains missing values due to sensor or communication\nerrors. The Spatio-temporal feature in traffic data brings more challenges for\nprocessing such missing values, for which the classic techniques (e.g., data\nimputations) are limited: 1) in temporal axis, the values can be randomly or\nconsecutively missing; 2) in spatial axis, the missing values can happen on one\nsingle sensor or on multiple sensors simultaneously. Recent models powered by\nGraph Neural Networks achieved satisfying performance on traffic forecasting\ntasks. However, few of them are applicable to such a complex missing-value\ncontext. To this end, we propose GCN-M, a Graph Convolutional Network model\nwith the ability to handle the complex missing values in the Spatio-temporal\ncontext. Particularly, we jointly model the missing value processing and\ntraffic forecasting tasks, considering both local Spatio-temporal features and\nglobal historical patterns in an attention-based memory network. We propose as\nwell a dynamic graph learning module based on the learned local-global\nfeatures. The experimental results on real-life datasets show the reliability\nof our proposed method.",

    "abstract": "While many classical notions of learnability (e.g., PAC learnability) are\ndistribution-free, utilizing the specific structures of an input distribution\nmay improve learning performance. For example, a product distribution on a\nmulti-dimensional input space has a much simpler structure than a correlated\ndistribution. A recent paper [GHTZ21] shows that the sample complexity of a\ngeneral learning problem on product distributions is polynomial in the input\ndimension, which is exponentially smaller than that on correlated\ndistributions. However, the learning algorithm they use is not the standard\nEmpirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithm. In this note, we characterize the\nsample complexity of ERM in a general learning problem on product\ndistributions. We show that, even though product distributions are simpler than\ncorrelated distributions, ERM still needs an exponential number of samples to\nlearn on product distributions, instead of a polynomial. This leads to the\nconclusion that a product distribution by itself does not make a learning\nproblem easier -- an algorithm designed specifically for product distributions\nis needed.",

    "abstract": "Cloud-edge collaborative inference approach splits deep neural networks\n(DNNs) into two parts that run collaboratively on resource-constrained edge\ndevices and cloud servers, aiming at minimizing inference latency and\nprotecting data privacy. However, even if the raw input data from edge devices\nis not directly exposed to the cloud, state-of-the-art attacks targeting\ncollaborative inference are still able to reconstruct the raw private data from\nthe intermediate outputs of the exposed local models, introducing serious\nprivacy risks. In this paper, a secure privacy inference framework for\ncloud-edge collaboration is proposed, termed CIS, which supports adaptively\npartitioning the network according to the dynamically changing network\nbandwidth and fully releases the computational power of edge devices. To\nmitigate the influence introduced by private perturbation, CIS provides a way\nto achieve differential privacy protection by adding refined noise to the\nintermediate layer feature maps offloaded to the cloud. Meanwhile, with a given\ntotal privacy budget, the budget is reasonably allocated by the size of the\nfeature graph rank generated by different convolution filters, which makes the\ninference in the cloud robust to the perturbed data, thus effectively trade-off\nthe conflicting problem between privacy and availability. Finally, we construct\na real cloud-edge collaborative inference computing scenario to verify the\neffectiveness of inference latency and model partitioning on\nresource-constrained edge devices.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and more\nspecifically long short-term memory nets (LSTMs), stand out in terms of\npopularity. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of such an LSTM to\nactually learn the underlying process model structure of an event log. We\nintroduce an evaluation framework that combines variant-based resampling and\ncustom metrics for fitness, precision and generalization. We evaluate 4\nhypotheses concerning the learning capabilities of LSTMs, the effect of\noverfitting countermeasures, the level of incompleteness in the training set\nand the level of parallelism in the underlying process model. We confirm that\nLSTMs can struggle to learn process model structure, even with simplistic\nprocess data and in a very lenient setup. Taking the correct anti-overfitting\nmeasures can alleviate the problem. However, these measures did not present\nthemselves to be optimal when selecting hyperparameters purely on predicting\naccuracy.

Generally, the adversarial attack for\nobject detection contains targeted attack and untargeted attack.

One way to obtain a\nmeasure of trust is through reputation mechanisms, which record one's past\nperformance and interactions to generate a reputational value.

The aim of\nthis paper is to discuss several social phenomena and map these to existing\nsocial reputation mechanisms in a variety of scopes. First, we focus on\nreputation mechanisms in the individual scope, in which everyone is responsible\nfor their own reputation. Subjective reputational values may be communicated to\ndifferent entities in the form of recommendations. Secondly, we discuss social\nreputation mechanisms in the acquaintances scope, where one's reputation can be\ntied to another through vouching or invite-only networks.

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle (AV) stacks are typically built in a modular fashion, with\nexplicit components performing detection, tracking, prediction, planning,\ncontrol, etc. While modularity improves reusability, interpretability, and\ngeneralizability, it also suffers from compounding errors, information\nbottlenecks, and integration challenges. To overcome these challenges, a\nprominent approach is to convert the AV stack into an end-to-end neural network\nand train it with data. While such approaches have achieved impressive results,\nthey typically lack interpretability and reusability, and they eschew\nprincipled analytical components, such as planning and control, in favor of\ndeep neural networks. To enable the joint optimization of AV stacks while\nretaining modularity, we present DiffStack, a differentiable and modular stack\nfor prediction, planning, and control. Crucially, our model-based planning and\ncontrol algorithms leverage recent advancements in differentiable optimization\nto produce gradients, enabling optimization of upstream components, such as\nprediction, via backpropagation through planning and control. Our results on\nthe nuScenes dataset indicate that end-to-end training with DiffStack yields\nsubstantial improvements in open-loop and closed-loop planning metrics by,\ne.g., learning to make fewer prediction errors that would affect planning.\nBeyond these immediate benefits, DiffStack opens up new opportunities for fully\ndata-driven yet modular and interpretable AV architectures.

Therefore, in this work, we introduce the design of the DLbased\nauction for the computing resource allocation in SemComenabled Metaverse.\nFirst, we briefly introduce the fundamentals and challenges of Metaverse.\nSecond, we present the preliminaries of SemCom and edge computing. Third, we\nreview various incentive mechanisms for edge computing resource trading.\nFourth, we present the design of the DL-based auction for edge resource\nallocation in SemCom-enabled Metaverse. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nDL-based auction improves the revenue while nearly satisfying the individual\nrationality and incentive compatibility constraints.",

We critically review this approach.\nWe primarily question whether the use of large Web-scraped datasets should be\nviewed as differential-privacy-preserving. We caution that publicizing these\nmodels pretrained on Web data as \"private\" could lead to harm and erode the\npublic's trust in differential privacy as a meaningful definition of privacy.\nBeyond the privacy considerations of using public data, we further question\nthe utility of this paradigm. We scrutinize whether existing machine learning\nbenchmarks are appropriate for measuring the ability of pretrained models to\ngeneralize to sensitive domains, which may be poorly represented in public Web\ndata. Finally, we notice that pretraining has been especially impactful for the\nlargest available models -- models sufficiently large to prohibit end users\nrunning them on their own devices. Thus, deploying such models today could be a\nnet loss for privacy, as it would require (private) data to be outsourced to a\nmore compute-powerful third party.\nWe conclude by discussing potential paths forward for the field of private\nlearning, as public pretraining becomes more popular and powerful.",

    "abstract": "Fruit harvesting has recently experienced a shift towards soft grippers that\npossess compliance, adaptability, and delicacy. In this context, pneumatic\ngrippers are popular, due to provision of high deformability and compliance,\nhowever they typically possess limited grip strength. Jamming possesses strong\ngrip capability, however has limited deformability and often requires the\nobject to be pushed onto a surface to attain a grip. This paper describes a\nhybrid gripper combining pneumatics (for deformation) and jamming (for grip\nstrength). Our gripper utilises a torus (donut) structure with two chambers\ncontrolled by pneumatic and vacuum pressure respectively, to conform around a\ntarget object. The gripper displays good adaptability, exploiting pneumatics to\nmould to the shape of the target object where jamming can be successfully\nharnessed to grip. The main contribution of the paper is design, fabrication,\nand characterisation of the first hybrid gripper that can use granular jamming\nin free space, achieving significantly larger retention forces compared to pure\npneumatics. We test our gripper on a range of different sizes and shapes, as\nwell as picking a broad range of real fruit.",

Our analysis of data collected from these websites\nshows that the vast majority of fake news domains are very young and appear to\nhave lower time periods of an IP associated with their domain than real news\nones.

    "abstract": "While deep learning-based methods for blind face restoration have achieved\nunprecedented success, they still suffer from two major limitations. First,\nmost of them deteriorate when facing complex degradations out of their training\ndata. Second, these methods require multiple constraints, e.g., fidelity,\nperceptual, and adversarial losses, which require laborious hyper-parameter\ntuning to stabilize and balance their influences. In this work, we propose a\nnovel method named DifFace that is capable of coping with unseen and complex\ndegradations more gracefully without complicated loss designs. The key of our\nmethod is to establish a posterior distribution from the observed low-quality\n(LQ) image to its high-quality (HQ) counterpart. In particular, we design a\ntransition distribution from the LQ image to the intermediate state of a\npre-trained diffusion model and then gradually transmit from this intermediate\nstate to the HQ target by recursively applying a pre-trained diffusion model.\nThe transition distribution only relies on a restoration backbone that is\ntrained with $L_2$ loss on some synthetic data, which favorably avoids the\ncumbersome training process in existing methods. Moreover, the transition\ndistribution can contract the error of the restoration backbone and thus makes\nour method more robust to unknown degradations. Comprehensive experiments show\nthat DifFace is superior to current state-of-the-art methods, especially in\ncases with severe degradations.

(2) fine-grained student\nensemble that updates each fragment of the teacher model with a temporal moving\naverage of the corresponding fragment of the student, which enhances consistent\npredictions on each model fragment against noise.

    "abstract": "Real-time monocular 3D reconstruction is a challenging problem that remains\nunsolved. Although recent end-to-end methods have demonstrated promising\nresults, tiny structures and geometric boundaries are hardly captured due to\ntheir insufficient supervision neglecting spatial details and oversimplified\nfeature fusion ignoring temporal cues. To address the problems, we propose an\nend-to-end 3D reconstruction network SST, which utilizes Sparse estimated\npoints from visual SLAM system as additional Spatial guidance and fuses\nTemporal features via a novel cross-modal attention mechanism, achieving more\ndetailed reconstruction results. We propose a Local Spatial-Temporal Fusion\nmodule to exploit more informative spatial-temporal cues from multi-view color\ninformation and sparse priors, as well a Global Spatial-Temporal Fusion module\nto refine the local TSDF volumes with the world-frame model from coarse to\nfine. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and 7-Scenes demonstrate that SST\noutperforms all state-of-the-art competitors, whilst keeping a high inference\nspeed at 59 FPS, enabling real-world applications with real-time requirements.",

    "title": "Validation of Neural Network Controllers for Uncertain Systems Through  Keep-Close Approach: Robustness Analysis and Safety Verification",
    "abstract": "Among the major challenges in neural control system technology is the\nvalidation and certification of the safety and robustness of neural network\n(NN) controllers against various uncertainties including unmodelled dynamics,\nnon-linearities, and time delays. One way in providing such validation\nguarantees is to maintain the closed-loop system output with a NN controller\nwhen its input changes within a bounded set, close to the output of a robustly\nperforming closed-loop reference model. This paper presents a novel approach to\nanalysing the performance and robustness of uncertain feedback systems with NN\ncontrollers. Due to the complexity of analysing such systems, the problem is\nreformulated as the problem of dynamical tracking errors between the\nclosed-loop system with a neural controller and an ideal closed-loop reference\nmodel. Then, the approximation of the controller error is characterised by\nadopting the differential mean value theorem (DMV) and the Integral Quadratic\nConstraints (IQCs) technique. Moreover, the Relative Integral Square Error\n(RISE) and the Supreme Square Error (SSE) bounded set are derived for the\noutput of the error dynamical system. The analysis is then performed by\nintegrating Lyapunov theory with the IQCs-based technique. The resulting\nworst-case analysis provides the user a prior knowledge about the worst case of\nRISE and SSE between the reference closed-loop model and the uncertain system\ncontrolled by the neural controller. The suitability of the proposed technique\nis demonstrated by the results obtained on a nonlinear single-link robot system\nwith a NN trained to control the movement of this mechanical system while\nkeeping close to an ideal closed-loop reference model.",

However, when using artificial neural\nnetworks (ANN), it is standard practice to use fixed-sized mini-batches. To do\nthis, time series data with varying lengths are typically normalized so that\nall the patterns are the same length. Normally, this is done using zero padding\nor truncation without much consideration. We propose a novel method of\nnormalizing the lengths of the time series in a dataset by exploiting the\ndynamic matching ability of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). In this way, the time\nseries lengths in a dataset can be set to a fixed size while maintaining\nfeatures typical to the dataset. In the experiments, all 11 datasets with\nvarying length time series from the 2018 UCR Time Series Archive are used.

    "abstract": "Context: Sustainable corporate behavior is increasingly valued by society and\nimpacts corporate reputation and customer trust. Hence, companies regularly\npublish sustainability reports to shed light on their impact on environmental,\nsocial, and governance (ESG) factors. Problem: Sustainability reports are\nwritten by companies themselves and are therefore considered a\ncompany-controlled source. Contrary, studies reveal that non-corporate channels\n(e.g., media coverage) represent the main driver for ESG transparency. However,\nanalysing media coverage regarding ESG factors is challenging since (1) the\namount of published news articles grows daily, (2) media coverage data does not\nnecessarily deal with an ESG-relevant topic, meaning that it must be carefully\nfiltered, and (3) the majority of media coverage data is unstructured. Research\nGoal: We aim to extract ESG-relevant information from textual media reactions\nautomatically to calculate an ESG score for a given company. Our goal is to\nreduce the cost of ESG data collection and make ESG information available to\nthe general public. Contribution: Our contributions are three-fold: First, we\npublish a corpus of 432,411 news headlines annotated as being environmental-,\ngovernance-, social-related, or ESG-irrelevant. Second, we present our\ntool-supported approach called ESG-Miner capable of analyzing and evaluating\nheadlines on corporate ESG-performance automatically.

Currently,\nPV inverters prevent damage to electronics by curtailing energy production in\nresponse to overvoltage.

Globally optimizing for fair curtailment requires\naccurate feeder parameters, which are often unknown. This paper investigates\nreinforcement learning, which gradually optimizes a fair PV curtailment\nstrategy by interacting with the system.

    "abstract": "We study streaming algorithms for the fundamental geometric problem of\ncomputing the cost of the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) on an $n$-point\nset $X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$. In the streaming model, the points in $X$ can be\nadded and removed arbitrarily, and the goal is to maintain an approximation in\nsmall space. In low dimensions, $(1+\\epsilon)$ approximations are possible in\nsublinear space [Frahling, Indyk, Sohler, SoCG '05]. However, for high\ndimensional spaces the best known approximation for this problem was\n$\\tilde{O}(\\log n)$, due to [Chen, Jayaram, Levi, Waingarten, STOC '22],\nimproving on the prior $O(\\log^2 n)$ bound due to [Indyk, STOC '04] and\n[Andoni, Indyk, Krauthgamer, SODA '08]. In this paper, we break the logarithmic\nbarrier, and give the first constant factor sublinear space approximation to\nEuclidean MST. For any $\\epsilon\\geq 1$, our algorithm achieves an\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ approximation in $n^{O(\\epsilon)}$ space.\nWe complement this by proving that any single pass algorithm which obtains a\nbetter than $1.10$-approximation must use $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ space,\ndemonstrating that $(1+\\epsilon)$ approximations are not possible in\nhigh-dimensions, and that our algorithm is tight up to a constant.\nNevertheless, we demonstrate that $(1+\\epsilon)$ approximations are possible in\nsublinear space with $O(1/\\epsilon)$ passes over the stream. More generally,\nfor any $\\alpha \\geq 2$, we give a $\\alpha$-pass streaming algorithm which\nachieves a $(1+O(\\frac{\\log \\alpha + 1}{ \\alpha \\epsilon}))$ approximation in\n$n^{O(\\epsilon)} d^{O(1)}$ space. Our streaming algorithms are linear sketches,\nand therefore extend to the massively-parallel computation model (MPC).

    "abstract": "Body segmentation is an important step in many computer vision problems\ninvolving human images and one of the key components that affects the\nperformance of all downstream tasks. Several prior works have approached this\nproblem using a multi-task model that exploits correlations between different\ntasks to improve segmentation performance. Based on the success of such\nsolutions, we present in this paper a novel multi-task model for human\nsegmentation/parsing that involves three tasks, i.e., (i) keypoint-based\nskeleton estimation, (ii) dense pose prediction, and (iii) human-body\nsegmentation. The main idea behind the proposed Segmentation--Pose--DensePose\nmodel (or SPD for short) is to learn a better segmentation model by sharing\nknowledge across different, yet related tasks. SPD is based on a shared deep\nneural network backbone that branches off into three task-specific model heads\nand is learned using a multi-task optimization objective. The performance of\nthe model is analysed through rigorous experiments on the LIP and ATR datasets\nand in comparison to a recent (state-of-the-art) multi-task body-segmentation\nmodel. Comprehensive ablation studies are also presented. Our experimental\nresults show that the proposed multi-task (segmentation) model is highly\ncompetitive and that the introduction of additional tasks contributes towards a\nhigher overall segmentation performance.",

Energy arbitrage can be a significant source of revenue for\nthe BESS due to the increasing price volatility in the spot market caused by\nthe mismatch between renewable generation and electricity demand. In addition,\nthe Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS) markets established to\nstabilize the grid can offer higher returns for the BESS due to their\ncapability to respond within milliseconds. Therefore, it is crucial for the\nBESS to carefully decide how much capacity to assign to each market to maximize\nthe total profit under uncertain market conditions. This paper formulates the\nbidding problem of the BESS as a Markov Decision Process, which enables the\nBESS to participate in both the spot market and the FCAS market to maximize\nprofit. Then, Proximal Policy Optimization, a model-free deep reinforcement\nlearning algorithm, is employed to learn the optimal bidding strategy from the\ndynamic environment of the energy market under a continuous bidding scale. The\nproposed model is trained and validated using real-world historical data of the\nAustralian National Electricity Market.

We further combine this approach with knowledge distillation\nrelying on an interaction-based teacher model trained on the source domain.

Recent work has\nimplemented machine learning models as a tool for forecasting hydrological\nresponse features, but these models neglect a crucial component of traditional\nhydrological modeling that spatially close units can have vastly different\nhydrological responses. In traditional hydrological modeling, units with\nsimilar hydrological properties are grouped together and share model parameters\nregardless of their spatial proximity.

We have trained, validated, and tested our method on field-scale time\nseries data consisting of approximately 99,000 hydrological response units\nspanning 40 years in a case study in northeastern United States.

Thus, how we measure\nsimilarity fundamentally determines what we learn. In machine learning and\nscientific modeling, similarity metrics are used as objective functions. A\nclassic example being mean squared error, which is the optimal measure of\nsimilarity when errors are normally distributed and independent and identically\ndistributed (iid). In many cases, however, the error distribution is neither\nnormal nor iid, so it is left to the scientist to determine an appropriate\nobjective.

    "abstract": "Co-authored articles tend to be more cited in many academic fields, but is\nthis because they tend to be higher quality or is it an audience effect:\nincreased awareness through multiple author networks? We address this unknown\nwith the largest investigation yet into whether author numbers associate with\nresearch quality, using expert peer quality judgements for 122,331 non-review\njournal articles submitted by UK academics for the 2014-20 national assessment\nprocess. Spearman correlations between the number of authors and the quality\nscores show moderately strong positive associations (0.2-0.4) in the health,\nlife, and physical sciences, but weak or no positive associations in\nengineering, and social sciences. In contrast, we found little or no\nassociation in the arts and humanities, and a possible negative association for\ndecision sciences. This gives reasonably conclusive evidence that greater\nnumbers of authors associates with higher quality journal articles in the\nmajority of academia outside the arts and humanities, at least for the UK.\nPositive associations between team size and citation counts in areas with\nlittle association between team size and quality also show that audience\neffects or other non-quality factors account for the higher citation rates of\nco-authored articles in some fields.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative research causes problems for research assessments because of\nthe difficulty in fairly crediting its authors. Whilst splitting the rewards\nfor an article amongst its authors has the greatest surface-level fairness,\nmany important evaluations assign full credit to each author, irrespective of\nteam size. The underlying rationales for this are labour reduction and the need\nto incentivise collaborative work because it is necessary to solve many\nimportant societal problems. This article assesses whether full counting\nchanges results compared to fractional counting in the case of the UK's\nResearch Excellence Framework (REF) 2021. For this assessment, fractional\ncounting reduces the number of journal articles to as little as 10% of the full\ncounting value, depending on the Unit of Assessment (UoA). Despite this large\ndifference, allocating an overall grade point average (GPA) based on full\ncounting or fractional counting give results with a median Pearson correlation\nwithin UoAs of 0.98. The largest changes are for Archaeology (r=0.84) and\nPhysics (r=0.88). There is a weak tendency for higher scoring institutions to\nlose from fractional counting, with the loss being statistically significant in\n5 of the 34 UoAs. Thus, whilst the apparent over-weighting of contributions to\ncollaboratively authored outputs does not seem too problematic from a fairness\nperspective overall, it may be worth examining in the few UoAs in which it\nmakes the most difference.",

    "abstract": "The dissemination of hateful memes online has adverse effects on social media\nplatforms and the real world. Detecting hateful memes is challenging, one of\nthe reasons being the evolutionary nature of memes; new hateful memes can\nemerge by fusing hateful connotations with other cultural ideas or symbols. In\nthis paper, we propose a framework that leverages multimodal contrastive\nlearning models, in particular OpenAI's CLIP, to identify targets of hateful\ncontent and systematically investigate the evolution of hateful memes. We find\nthat semantic regularities exist in CLIP-generated embeddings that describe\nsemantic relationships within the same modality (images) or across modalities\n(images and text). Leveraging this property, we study how hateful memes are\ncreated by combining visual elements from multiple images or fusing textual\ninformation with a hateful image. We demonstrate the capabilities of our\nframework for analyzing the evolution of hateful memes by focusing on\nantisemitic memes, particularly the Happy Merchant meme. Using our framework on\na dataset extracted from 4chan, we find 3.3K variants of the Happy Merchant\nmeme, with some linked to specific countries, persons, or organizations. We\nenvision that our framework can be used to aid human moderators by flagging new\nvariants of hateful memes so that moderators can manually verify them and\nmitigate the problem of hateful content online.",

The problems are\nmotivated by the lack of explainability of AI models in security and safety\ncritical applications, such as the use of AI models for classification of\ntraffic signs in self-driving cars. We approach the problems by introducing\ntheoretical underpinnings of AI model utilization measurement and understanding\npatterns in utilization-based class encodings of traffic signs at the level of\ncomputation graphs (AI models), subgraphs, and graph nodes.

In this work, utilization measurements are\nextracted from AI models, which include poisoned and clean AI models. In\ncontrast to clean AI models, the poisoned AI models were trained with traffic\nsign images containing systematic, physically realizable, traffic sign\nmodifications (i.e., triggers) to change a correct class label to another label\nin a presence of such a trigger. We analyze class encodings of such clean and\npoisoned AI models, and conclude with implications for trojan injection and\ndetection.",

However, the\npre-training computational budget is too heavy and withholds the MIM from\nbecoming a practical training paradigm. This paper presents FastMIM, a simple\nand generic framework for expediting masked image modeling with the following\ntwo steps: (i) pre-training vision backbones with low-resolution input images;\nand (ii) reconstructing Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature instead\nof original RGB values of the input images. In addition, we propose FastMIM-P\nto progressively enlarge the input resolution during pre-training stage to\nfurther enhance the transfer results of models with high capacity. We point out\nthat: (i) a wide range of input resolutions in pre-training phase can lead to\nsimilar performances in fine-tuning phase and downstream tasks such as\ndetection and segmentation; (ii) the shallow layers of encoder are more\nimportant during pre-training and discarding last several layers can speed up\nthe training stage with no harm to fine-tuning performance; (iii) the decoder\nshould match the size of selected network; and (iv) HOG is more stable than RGB\nvalues when resolution transfers;. Equipped with FastMIM, all kinds of vision\nbackbones can be pre-trained in an efficient way.

While the initial patch-based models (ViTs) treated all\npatches equally, recent studies reveal that incorporating inductive bias like\nspatiality benefits the representations. However, most prior works solely\nfocused on the location of patches, overlooking the scene structure of images.\nThus, we aim to further guide the interaction of patches using the object\ninformation.

Using the object labels, OAMixer computes a reweighting mask with a\nlearnable scale parameter that intensifies the interaction of patches\ncontaining similar objects and applies the mask to the patch mixing layers. By\nlearning an object-centric representation, we demonstrate that OAMixer improves\nthe classification accuracy and background robustness of various patch-based\nmodels, including ViTs, MLP-Mixers, and ConvMixers.

    "abstract": "In the field of privacy protection, publishing complete data (especially\nhigh-dimensional data sets) is one of the most challenging problems. The common\nencryption technology can not deal with the attacker to take differential\nattack to obtain sensitive information, while the existing differential privacy\nprotection algorithm model takes a long time for high-dimensional calculation\nand needs to add noise to reduce data accuracy, which is not suitable for\nhigh-dimensional large data sets. In view of this situation, this paper designs\na complete data synthesis scheme to protect data privacy around the concept of\n\"plausible denial\". Firstly, the paper provides the theoretical support for the\ndifference between \"plausible data\" and \"plausible data\". In the process of\nscheme designing, this paper decomposes the scheme design into construction\ndata synthesis module and privacy test module, then designs algorithm models\nfor them respectively and realizes the function of privacy protection. When\nevaluating the feasibility of the scheme, the paper selects the Results of the\n2013 community census in the United States as the high-dimensional data set,\nuses the simulation program that is based on Python to test and analyzes the\nefficiency and reliability of the data synthesis scheme. This portion focuses\non the evaluation of the privacy protection effectiveness of the scheme.",

    "abstract": "APIs have become the prominent technology of choice for achieving\ninter-service communications. The growth of API deployments has driven the\nurgency in addressing its lack of security standards. API Security is a topic\nfor concern given the absence of standardized authorization in the OpenAPI\nstandard, improper authorization opens the possibility for known and unknown\nvulnerabilities, which in the past years have been exploited by malicious\nactors resulting in data loss. This paper examines the number one vulnerability\nin API Security: Broken Object Level Authorization(BOLA), and proposes methods\nand tools to reduce the prevalence of this vulnerability. BOLA affects various\nAPI frameworks, our scope is fixated on the OpenAPI Specification(OAS). The OAS\nis a standard for describing and implementing APIs; popular OAS Implementations\nare FastAPI, Connexion (Flask), and many more. These implementations carry the\npros and cons that are associated with the OASs knowledge of API properties.\nThe Open API Specifications security properties do not address object\nauthorization and provide no standardized approach to define such object\nproperties. This leaves object-level security at the mercy of developers, which\npresents an increased risk of unintentionally creating attack vectors. Our aim\nis to tackle this void by introducing 1) the OAS ESS (OpenAPI Specification\nExtended Security Scheme) which includes declarative security controls for\nobjects in OAS (design-based approach), and 2) an authorization module that can\nbe imported to API services (Flask/FastAPI) to enforce authorization checks at\nthe object level (development-based approach). When building an API service, a\ndeveloper can start with the API design (specification) or its code. In both\ncases, a set of mechanisms are introduced to help developers mitigate and\nreduce the prevalence of BOLA.",

    "abstract": "In time series forecasting, decomposition-based algorithms break aggregate\ndata into meaningful components and are therefore appreciated for their\nparticular advantages in interpretability. Recent algorithms often combine\nmachine learning (hereafter ML) methodology with decomposition to improve\nprediction accuracy. However, incorporating ML is generally considered to\nsacrifice interpretability inevitably. In addition, existing hybrid algorithms\nusually rely on theoretical models with statistical assumptions and focus only\non the accuracy of aggregate predictions, and thus suffer from accuracy\nproblems, especially in component estimates. In response to the above issues,\nthis research explores the possibility of improving accuracy without losing\ninterpretability in time series forecasting. We first quantitatively define\ninterpretability for data-driven forecasts and systematically review the\nexisting forecasting algorithms from the perspective of interpretability.\nAccordingly, we propose the W-R algorithm, a hybrid algorithm that combines\ndecomposition and ML from a novel perspective. Specifically, the W-R algorithm\nreplaces the standard additive combination function with a weighted variant and\nuses ML to modify the estimates of all components simultaneously. We\nmathematically analyze the theoretical basis of the algorithm and validate its\nperformance through extensive numerical experiments. In general, the W-R\nalgorithm outperforms all decomposition-based and ML benchmarks. Based on\nP50_QL, the algorithm relatively improves by 8.76% in accuracy on the practical\nsales forecasts of JD.com and 77.99% on a public dataset of electricity loads.\nThis research offers an innovative perspective to combine the statistical and\nML algorithms, and JD.com has implemented the W-R algorithm to make accurate\nsales predictions and guide its marketing activities.",

We denote our method DELS-MVS: Deep Epipolar Line\nSearch Multi-View Stereo. Previous works in deep MVS select a range of interest\nwithin the depth space, discretize it, and sample the epipolar line according\nto the resulting depth values: this can result in an uneven scanning of the\nepipolar line, hence of the image space. Instead, our method works directly on\nthe epipolar line: this guarantees an even scanning of the image space and\navoids both the need to select a depth range of interest, which is often not\nknown a priori and can vary dramatically from scene to scene, and the need for\na suitable discretization of the depth space. In fact, our search is iterative,\nwhich avoids the building of a cost volume, costly both to store and to\nprocess. Finally, our method performs a robust geometry-aware fusion of the\nestimated depth maps, leveraging a confidence predicted alongside each depth.\nWe test DELS-MVS on the ETH3D, Tanks and Temples and DTU benchmarks and achieve\ncompetitive results with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.",

In this work, we optimize uplink scheduling\nfor an access point (AP) over multiple unknown channels with heterogeneous AoI\nrequirements defined by AoI-dependent costs. The AP serves $N$ users by using\n$M$ channels without the channel state information. Each channel serves only\none user in each decision epoch. The optimization objective is to minimize the\ntime-averaged AoI-dependent costs plus additional communication transmission\ncosts over an infinite horizon. This decision-making problem can be formulated\nas a Markov decision process, but it is computationally intractable because the\nsize of the state space grows exponentially with respect to the number of\nusers. To alleviate the challenge, we reformulate the problem as a variant of\nthe restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem and leverage Whittle's index\ntheory to design an index-based scheduling policy algorithm. We derive an\nanalytic formula for the indices, which reduces the computational overhead and\nfacilitates online adaptation.

A popular\napproach is pseudo-labeling that generates pseudo labels only for those\nunlabeled data with high-confidence predictions. As for the low-confidence\nones, existing methods often simply discard them because these unreliable\npseudo labels may mislead the model. Nevertheless, we highlight that these data\nwith low-confidence pseudo labels can be still beneficial to the training\nprocess. Specifically, although the class with the highest probability in the\nprediction is unreliable, we can assume that this sample is very unlikely to\nbelong to the classes with the lowest probabilities. In this way, these data\ncan be also very informative if we can effectively exploit these complementary\nlabels, i.e., the classes that a sample does not belong to. Inspired by this,\nwe propose a novel Contrastive Complementary Labeling (CCL) method that\nconstructs a large number of reliable negative pairs based on the complementary\nlabels and adopts contrastive learning to make use of all the unlabeled data.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that CCL significantly improves the\nperformance on top of existing methods.

    "abstract": "Existing deep learning-based traffic forecasting models are mainly trained\nwith MSE (or MAE) as the loss function, assuming that residuals/errors follow\nindependent and isotropic Gaussian (or Laplacian) distribution for simplicity.\nHowever, this assumption rarely holds for real-world traffic forecasting tasks,\nwhere the unexplained residuals are often correlated in both space and time. In\nthis study, we propose Spatiotemporal Residual Regularization by modeling\nresiduals with a dynamic (e.g., time-varying) mixture of zero-mean multivariate\nGaussian distribution with learnable spatiotemporal covariance matrices. This\napproach allows us to directly capture spatiotemporally correlated residuals.\nFor scalability, we model the spatiotemporal covariance for each mixture\ncomponent using a Kronecker product structure, which significantly reduces the\nnumber of parameters and computation complexity. We evaluate the performance of\nthe proposed method on a traffic speed forecasting task. Our results show that,\nby properly modeling residual distribution, the proposed method not only\nimproves the model performance but also provides interpretable structures.",

Each service is evaluated using cycle-accurate simulations on FPGAs\nin AWS. We found that packets are classified 2$\\times$ faster and INT reports\nare processed more than an order of magnitude quickly than state-of-the-art\napproaches.

In this chapter we focus instead on two main emerging trends we\nbelieve capture the most relevant and exciting activities in the field:\ndifferentiable intelligence and on-board machine learning. Differentiable\nintelligence, in a nutshell, refers to works making extensive use of automatic\ndifferentiation frameworks to learn the parameters of machine learning or\nrelated models. Onboard machine learning considers the problem of moving\ninference, as well as learning, onboard.

    "title": "Towards Deeper and Better Multi-view Feature Fusion for 3D Semantic  Segmentation",
    "abstract": "3D point clouds are rich in geometric structure information, while 2D images\ncontain important and continuous texture information. Combining 2D information\nto achieve better 3D semantic segmentation has become mainstream in 3D scene\nunderstanding. Albeit the success, it still remains elusive how to fuse and\nprocess the cross-dimensional features from these two distinct spaces. Existing\nstate-of-the-art usually exploit bidirectional projection methods to align the\ncross-dimensional features and realize both 2D & 3D semantic segmentation\ntasks. However, to enable bidirectional mapping, this framework often requires\na symmetrical 2D-3D network structure, thus limiting the network's flexibility.\nMeanwhile, such dual-task settings may distract the network easily and lead to\nover-fitting in the 3D segmentation task. As limited by the network's\ninflexibility, fused features can only pass through a decoder network, which\naffects model performance due to insufficient depth. To alleviate these\ndrawbacks, in this paper, we argue that despite its simplicity, projecting\nunidirectionally multi-view 2D deep semantic features into the 3D space aligned\nwith 3D deep semantic features could lead to better feature fusion. On the one\nhand, the unidirectional projection enforces our model focused more on the core\ntask, i.e., 3D segmentation; on the other hand, unlocking the bidirectional to\nunidirectional projection enables a deeper cross-domain semantic alignment and\nenjoys the flexibility to fuse better and complicated features from very\ndifferent spaces. In joint 2D-3D approaches, our proposed method achieves\nsuperior performance on the ScanNetv2 benchmark for 3D semantic segmentation.",

Our approach is based on\nthe observation that, in many domains, text tokens should only describe a small\nnumber of image regions and, likewise, each image region should correspond to\nonly a few text tokens. In CLIP-style models, this implies that text-token\nembeddings should have high similarity to only a small number of image-patch\nembeddings for a given image-text pair. We formalize this observation using a\nnovel regularization scheme that penalizes the entropy of the text-token to\nimage-patch similarity scores. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate\nthat the proposed regularization scheme shrinks the text-token and image-patch\nsimilarity scores towards zero, thus achieving the desired effect. We\ndemonstrate the promise of our approach in an important medical context where\nthis underlying hypothesis naturally arises.

Therefore, the main direction to improve the\naccuracy of object detection tasks is to improve the neural network to extract\nfeatures better. In this paper, I propose a convolutional module with a\ntransformer[1], which aims to improve the recognition accuracy of the model by\nfusing the detailed features extracted by CNN[2] with the global features\nextracted by a transformer and significantly reduce the computational effort of\nthe transformer module by deflating the feature mAP. The main execution steps\nare convolutional downsampling to reduce the feature map size, then\nself-attention calculation and upsampling, and finally concatenation with the\ninitial input. In the experimental part, after splicing the block to the end of\nYOLOv5n[3] and training 300 epochs on the coco dataset, the mAP improved by\n1.7% compared with the previous YOLOv5n, and the mAP curve did not show any\nsaturation phenomenon, so there is still potential for improvement. After 100\nrounds of training on the Pascal VOC dataset, the accuracy of the results\nreached 81%, which is 4.6 better than the faster RCNN[4] using resnet101[5] as\nthe backbone, but the number of parameters is less than one-twentieth of it.",

    "title": "Semantic Brain Decoding: from fMRI to conceptually similar image  reconstruction of visual stimuli",
    "abstract": "Brain decoding is a field of computational neuroscience that uses measurable\nbrain activity to infer mental states or internal representations of perceptual\ninputs. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to brain decoding that also\nrelies on semantic and contextual similarity. We employ an fMRI dataset of\nnatural image vision and create a deep learning decoding pipeline inspired by\nthe existence of both bottom-up and top-down processes in human vision. We\ntrain a linear brain-to-feature model to map fMRI activity features to visual\nstimuli features, assuming that the brain projects visual information onto a\nspace that is homeomorphic to the latent space represented by the last\nconvolutional layer of a pretrained convolutional neural network, which\ntypically collects a variety of semantic features that summarize and highlight\nsimilarities and differences between concepts. These features are then\ncategorized in the latent space using a nearest-neighbor strategy, and the\nresults are used to condition a generative latent diffusion model to create\nnovel images. From fMRI data only, we produce reconstructions of visual stimuli\nthat match the original content very well on a semantic level, surpassing the\nstate of the art in previous literature. We evaluate our work and obtain good\nresults using a quantitative semantic metric (the Wu-Palmer similarity metric\nover the WordNet lexicon, which had an average value of 0.57) and perform a\nhuman evaluation experiment that resulted in correct evaluation, according to\nthe multiplicity of human criteria in evaluating image similarity, in over 80%\nof the test set.",

    "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) are quickly becoming the de-facto architecture for\ncomputer vision, yet we understand very little about why they work and what\nthey learn. While existing studies visually analyze the mechanisms of\nconvolutional neural networks, an analogous exploration of ViTs remains\nchallenging. In this paper, we first address the obstacles to performing\nvisualizations on ViTs. Assisted by these solutions, we observe that neurons in\nViTs trained with language model supervision (e.g., CLIP) are activated by\nsemantic concepts rather than visual features. We also explore the underlying\ndifferences between ViTs and CNNs, and we find that transformers detect image\nbackground features, just like their convolutional counterparts, but their\npredictions depend far less on high-frequency information. On the other hand,\nboth architecture types behave similarly in the way features progress from\nabstract patterns in early layers to concrete objects in late layers. In\naddition, we show that ViTs maintain spatial information in all layers except\nthe final layer. In contrast to previous works, we show that the last layer\nmost likely discards the spatial information and behaves as a learned global\npooling operation. Finally, we conduct large-scale visualizations on a wide\nrange of ViT variants, including DeiT, CoaT, ConViT, PiT, Swin, and Twin, to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Pre-training by numerous image data has become de-facto for robust 2D\nrepresentations. In contrast, due to the expensive data acquisition and\nannotation, a paucity of large-scale 3D datasets severely hinders the learning\nfor high-quality 3D features. In this paper, we propose an alternative to\nobtain superior 3D representations from 2D pre-trained models via\nImage-to-Point Masked Autoencoders, named as I2P-MAE. By self-supervised\npre-training, we leverage the well learned 2D knowledge to guide 3D masked\nautoencoding, which reconstructs the masked point tokens with an\nencoder-decoder architecture. Specifically, we first utilize off-the-shelf 2D\nmodels to extract the multi-view visual features of the input point cloud, and\nthen conduct two types of image-to-point learning schemes on top. For one, we\nintroduce a 2D-guided masking strategy that maintains semantically important\npoint tokens to be visible for the encoder. Compared to random masking, the\nnetwork can better concentrate on significant 3D structures and recover the\nmasked tokens from key spatial cues. For another, we enforce these visible\ntokens to reconstruct the corresponding multi-view 2D features after the\ndecoder. This enables the network to effectively inherit high-level 2D\nsemantics learned from rich image data for discriminative 3D modeling. Aided by\nour image-to-point pre-training, the frozen I2P-MAE, without any fine-tuning,\nachieves 93.4% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, competitive to the fully\ntrained results of existing methods. By further fine-tuning on on\nScanObjectNN's hardest split, I2P-MAE attains the state-of-the-art 90.11%\naccuracy, +3.68% to the second-best, demonstrating superior transferable\ncapacity.

    "title": "GPViT: A High Resolution Non-Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Group  Propagation",
    "abstract": "We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel\nnonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general\nvisual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or\ntokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained\ndetails such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information\nbetween these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the\nway self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group\nPropagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block,\nfeatures are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group\ntokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged\nbetween the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated\ngrouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer\ndecoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including\nimage classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance\nsegmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous\nworks across all tasks, especially on tasks that require high-resolution\noutputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU\non ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.

    "title": "AutoPV: Automated photovoltaic forecasts with limited information using  an ensemble of pre-trained models",
    "abstract": "Accurate PhotoVoltaic (PV) power generation forecasting is vital for the\nefficient operation of Smart Grids. The automated design of such accurate\nforecasting models for individual PV plants includes two challenges: First,\ninformation about the PV mounting configuration (i.e. inclination and azimuth\nangles) is often missing. Second, for new PV plants, the amount of historical\ndata available to train a forecasting model is limited (cold-start problem). We\naddress these two challenges by proposing a new method for day-ahead PV power\ngeneration forecasts called AutoPV. AutoPV is a weighted ensemble of\nforecasting models that represent different PV mounting configurations. This\nrepresentation is achieved by pre-training each forecasting model on a separate\nPV plant and by scaling the model's output with the peak power rating of the\ncorresponding PV plant. To tackle the cold-start problem, we initially weight\neach forecasting model in the ensemble equally. To tackle the problem of\nmissing information about the PV mounting configuration, we use new data that\nbecome available during operation to adapt the ensemble weights to minimize the\nforecasting error. AutoPV is advantageous as the unknown PV mounting\nconfiguration is implicitly reflected in the ensemble weights, and only the PV\nplant's peak power rating is required to re-scale the ensemble's output. AutoPV\nalso allows to represent PV plants with panels distributed on different roofs\nwith varying alignments, as these mounting configurations can be reflected\nproportionally in the weighting. Additionally, the required computing memory is\ndecoupled when scaling AutoPV to hundreds of PV plants, which is beneficial in\nSmart Grids with limited computing capabilities. For a real-world data set with\n11 PV plants, the accuracy of AutoPV is comparable to a model trained on two\nyears of data and outperforms an incrementally trained model.",

To investigate both these questions,\nwe perform a fine-grained comparison of language models and humans on seven\npragmatic phenomena, using zero-shot prompting on an expert-curated set of\nEnglish materials. We ask whether models (1) select pragmatic interpretations\nof speaker utterances, (2) make similar error patterns as humans, and (3) use\nsimilar linguistic cues as humans to solve the tasks. We find that the largest\nmodels achieve high accuracy and match human error patterns: within incorrect\nresponses, models favor the literal interpretation of an utterance over\nheuristic-based distractors. We also find evidence that models and humans are\nsensitive to similar linguistic cues.

    "abstract": "We introduce Structured 3D Features, a model based on a novel implicit 3D\nrepresentation that pools pixel-aligned image features onto dense 3D points\nsampled from a parametric, statistical human mesh surface. The 3D points have\nassociated semantics and can move freely in 3D space. This allows for optimal\ncoverage of the person of interest, beyond just the body shape, which in turn,\nadditionally helps modeling accessories, hair, and loose clothing. Owing to\nthis, we present a complete 3D transformer-based attention framework which,\ngiven a single image of a person in an unconstrained pose, generates an\nanimatable 3D reconstruction with albedo and illumination decomposition, as a\nresult of a single end-to-end model, trained semi-supervised, and with no\nadditional postprocessing. We show that our S3F model surpasses the previous\nstate-of-the-art on various tasks, including monocular 3D reconstruction, as\nwell as albedo and shading estimation. Moreover, we show that the proposed\nmethodology allows novel view synthesis, relighting, and re-posing the\nreconstruction, and can naturally be extended to handle multiple input images\n(e.g. different views of a person, or the same view, in different poses, in\nvideo).

As a result, a rapid increase in the usage of such systems can be\nobserved in the healthcare industry, for instance in the form of medical image\nclassification systems, where these models have achieved diagnostic parity with\nhuman physicians. One such application where this can be observed is in\ncomputer vision tasks such as the classification of skin lesions in\ndermatoscopic images. However, as stakeholders in the healthcare industry, such\nas insurance companies, continue to invest extensively in machine learning\ninfrastructure, it becomes increasingly important to understand the\nvulnerabilities in such systems.

This paper explores common adversarial attack\ntechniques. The Fast Sign Gradient Method and Projected Descent Gradient are\nused against a Convolutional Neural Network trained to classify dermatoscopic\nimages of skin lesions. Following that, it also discusses one of the most\npopular adversarial defense techniques, adversarial training. The performance\nof the model that has been trained on adversarial examples is then tested\nagainst the previously mentioned attacks, and recommendations to improve neural\nnetworks robustness are thus provided based on the results of the experiment.",

    "abstract": "Prior work has identified a resilient phenomenon that threatens the\nperformance of human-AI decision-making teams: overreliance, when people agree\nwith an AI, even when it is incorrect. Surprisingly, overreliance does not\nreduce when the AI produces explanations for its predictions, compared to only\nproviding predictions. Some have argued that overreliance results from\ncognitive biases or uncalibrated trust, attributing overreliance to an\ninevitability of human cognition. By contrast, our paper argues that people\nstrategically choose whether or not to engage with an AI explanation,\ndemonstrating empirically that there are scenarios where AI explanations reduce\noverreliance. To achieve this, we formalize this strategic choice in a\ncost-benefit framework, where the costs and benefits of engaging with the task\nare weighed against the costs and benefits of relying on the AI. We manipulate\nthe costs and benefits in a maze task, where participants collaborate with a\nsimulated AI to find the exit of a maze. Through 5 studies (N = 731), we find\nthat costs such as task difficulty (Study 1), explanation difficulty (Study 2,\n3), and benefits such as monetary compensation (Study 4) affect overreliance.\nFinally, Study 5 adapts the Cognitive Effort Discounting paradigm to quantify\nthe utility of different explanations, providing further support for our\nframework. Our results suggest that some of the null effects found in\nliterature could be due in part to the explanation not sufficiently reducing\nthe costs of verifying the AI's prediction.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has recently facilitated many advances in solving\nproblems related to many-body physical systems. Given the intrinsic quantum\nnature of these problems, it is natural to speculate that quantum-enhanced\nmachine learning will enable us to unveil even greater details than we\ncurrently have. With this motivation, this paper examines a quantum machine\nlearning approach based on shallow variational ansatz inspired by tensor\nnetworks for supervised learning tasks. In particular, we first look at the\nstandard image classification tasks using the Fashion-MNIST dataset and study\nthe effect of repeating tensor network layers on ansatz's expressibility and\nperformance. Finally, we use this strategy to tackle the problem of quantum\nphase recognition for the transverse-field Ising and Heisenberg spin models in\none and two dimensions, where we were able to reach $\\geq 98\\%$ test-set\naccuracies with both multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) and\ntree tensor network (TTN) inspired parametrized quantum circuits.",

    "abstract": "In many scientific applications, it is common to use binary (i.e.,\nunweighted) edges in the study of networks to examine collections of entities\nthat are either adjacent or not adjacent. Researchers have generalized such\nbinary networks to incorporate edge weights, which allow one to encode\nnode--node interactions with heterogeneous intensities or frequencies (e.g., in\ntransportation networks, supply chains, and social networks). Most such studies\nhave considered real-valued weights, despite the fact that networks with\ncomplex weights arise in fields as diverse as quantum information, quantum\nchemistry, electrodynamics, rheology, and machine learning. Many of the\nstandard approaches from network science that originated in the study of\nclassical systems and are based on real-valued edge weights cannot be applied\ndirectly to networks with complex edge weights. In this paper, we examine how\nstandard network-analysis methods fail to capture structural features of\nnetworks with complex weights. We then generalize several network measures to\nthe complex domain and show that random-walk centralities provide a useful tool\nto examine node importances in networks with complex weights.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning classifiers provide the most accurate means of automatically\ndiagnosing diabetic retinopathy (DR) based on optical coherence tomography\n(OCT) and its angiography (OCTA). The power of these models is attributable in\npart to the inclusion of hidden layers that provide the complexity required to\nachieve a desired task. However, hidden layers also render algorithm outputs\ndifficult to interpret. Here we introduce a novel biomarker activation map\n(BAM) framework based on generative adversarial learning that allows clinicians\nto verify and understand classifiers decision-making. A data set including 456\nmacular scans were graded as non-referable or referable DR based on current\nclinical standards. A DR classifier that was used to evaluate our BAM was first\ntrained based on this data set. The BAM generation framework was designed by\ncombing two U-shaped generators to provide meaningful interpretability to this\nclassifier. The main generator was trained to take referable scans as input and\nproduce an output that would be classified by the classifier as non-referable.\nThe BAM is then constructed as the difference image between the output and\ninput of the main generator. To ensure that the BAM only highlights\nclassifier-utilized biomarkers an assistant generator was trained to do the\nopposite, producing scans that would be classified as referable by the\nclassifier from non-referable scans. The generated BAMs highlighted known\npathologic features including nonperfusion area and retinal fluid. A fully\ninterpretable classifier based on these highlights could help clinicians better\nutilize and verify automated DR diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit the class of iterative shrinkage-thresholding\nalgorithms (ISTA) for solving the linear inverse problem with sparse\nrepresentation, which arises in signal and image processing. It is shown in the\nnumerical experiment to deblur an image that the convergence behavior in the\nlogarithmic-scale ordinate tends to be linear instead of logarithmic,\napproximating to be flat. Making meticulous observations, we find that the\nprevious assumption for the smooth part to be convex weakens the least-square\nmodel. Specifically, assuming the smooth part to be strongly convex is more\nreasonable for the least-square model, even though the image matrix is probably\nill-conditioned. Furthermore, we improve the pivotal inequality tighter for\ncomposite optimization with the smooth part to be strongly convex instead of\ngeneral convex, which is first found in [Li et al., 2022]. Based on this\npivotal inequality, we generalize the linear convergence to composite\noptimization in both the objective value and the squared proximal subgradient\nnorm. Meanwhile, we set a simple ill-conditioned matrix which is easy to\ncompute the singular values instead of the original blur matrix. The new\nnumerical experiment shows the proximal generalization of Nesterov's\naccelerated gradient descent (NAG) for the strongly convex function has a\nfaster linear convergence rate than ISTA. Based on the tighter pivotal\ninequality, we also generalize the faster linear convergence rate to composite\noptimization, in both the objective value and the squared proximal subgradient\nnorm, by taking advantage of the well-constructed Lyapunov function with a\nslight modification and the phase-space representation based on the\nhigh-resolution differential equation framework from the implicit-velocity\nscheme.",

To address this, we present an MRI-based\ndeep learning method for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer\napplicable to a patient population with subsequent ground truth biopsy results\nranging from benign pathology to ISUP grade group~5. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate that mixed supervision via diverse histopathological ground truth\nimproves classification performance despite the cost of reduced concordance\nwith image-based segmentation.

    "abstract": "U-shaped networks are widely used in various medical image tasks, such as\nsegmentation, restoration and reconstruction, but most of them usually rely on\ncentralized learning and thus ignore privacy issues. To address the privacy\nconcerns, federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) have attracted\nincreasing attention. However, it is hard for both FL and SL to balance the\nlocal computational cost, model privacy and parallel training simultaneously.\nTo achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose Robust Split Federated Learning\n(RoS-FL) for U-shaped medical image networks, which is a novel hybrid learning\nparadigm of FL and SL. Previous works cannot preserve the data privacy,\nincluding the input, model parameters, label and output simultaneously. To\neffectively deal with all of them, we design a novel splitting method for\nU-shaped medical image networks, which splits the network into three parts\nhosted by different parties. Besides, the distributed learning methods usually\nsuffer from a drift between local and global models caused by data\nheterogeneity. Based on this consideration, we propose a dynamic weight\ncorrection strategy (\\textbf{DWCS}) to stabilize the training process and avoid\nmodel drift. Specifically, a weight correction loss is designed to quantify the\ndrift between the models from two adjacent communication rounds. By minimizing\nthis loss, a correction model is obtained. Then we treat the weighted sum of\ncorrection model and final round models as the result. The effectiveness of the\nproposed RoS-FL is supported by extensive experimental results on different\ntasks.

Different from the analog approach which requires\nadditional power synchronization and phase synchronization, our MRP-based\ndigital approach is compatible with commercial LoRa nodes and is more reliable.\nDifferent from traditional MPR approaches that are designed for the collision\ndecoding scenario, our new MPR approach allows simultaneous transmissions with\nsmall packet arrival time offsets, and addresses a new co-located peak problem\nthrough the following components: 1) an improved channel and offset estimation\nalgorithm that enables accurate phase tracking in each symbol, 2) a new symbol\ndemodulation algorithm that finds the maximum likelihood sequence of nodes'\ndata, and 3) a soft-decision packet decoding algorithm that utilizes the\nlikelihoods of several sequences to improve decoding performance. Trace-driven\nsimulation results show that the symbol demodulation algorithm outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art MPR decoder by 5.3$\\times$ in terms of physical-layer\nthroughput, and the soft decoder is more robust to unavoidable adverse phase\nmisalignment and estimation error in practice. Moreover, LoRaPDA outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art MPR scheme by at least 2.1$\\times$ for all SNRs in terms\nof network throughput, demonstrating quick and reliable data aggregation.",

    "title": "Category Theory for Quantum Natural Language Processing",
    "abstract": "This thesis introduces quantum natural language processing (QNLP) models\nbased on a simple yet powerful analogy between computational linguistics and\nquantum mechanics: grammar as entanglement. The grammatical structure of text\nand sentences connects the meaning of words in the same way that entanglement\nstructure connects the states of quantum systems. Category theory allows to\nmake this language-to-qubit analogy formal: it is a monoidal functor from\ngrammar to vector spaces. We turn this abstract analogy into a concrete\nalgorithm that translates the grammatical structure onto the architecture of\nparameterised quantum circuits. We then use a hybrid classical-quantum\nalgorithm to train the model so that evaluating the circuits computes the\nmeaning of sentences in data-driven tasks.\nThe implementation of QNLP models motivated the development of DisCoPy\n(Distributional Compositional Python), the toolkit for applied category theory\nof which the first chapter gives a comprehensive overview. String diagrams are\nthe core data structure of DisCoPy, they allow to reason about computation at a\nhigh level of abstraction. We show how they can encode both grammatical\nstructures and quantum circuits, but also logical formulae, neural networks or\narbitrary Python code. Monoidal functors allow to translate these abstract\ndiagrams into concrete computation, interfacing with optimised task-specific\nlibraries.\nThe second chapter uses DisCopy to implement QNLP models as parameterised\nfunctors from grammar to quantum circuits. It gives a first proof-of-concept\nfor the more general concept of functorial learning: generalising machine\nlearning from functions to functors by learning from diagram-like data. In\norder to learn optimal functor parameters via gradient descent, we introduce\nthe notion of diagrammatic differentiation: a graphical calculus for computing\nthe gradients of parameterised diagrams.",

    "abstract": "Quantum circuits are widely used for benchmarking quantum computers and\ntherefore crucial for the development and improvement of full-stack quantum\ncomputing systems. To execute such circuits on a given quantum processor, they\nhave to be modified to comply with its physical constraints. That process is\ndone during the compilation phase and known as mapping of quantum circuits. The\nresult of the mapping procedure is highly dependent not only on the hardware\nconstraints, but also on the properties of the circuit itself. In this paper,\nwe propose to explore the structure of quantum circuits to get detailed\ninsights into their success rate when being executed on a given quantum device\nwhile using a specific compilation technique. To this purpose, we have\ncharacterized a large body of quantum circuits by extracting graph theory-based\nproperties from their corresponding qubit interaction graphs and afterwards\nclustered them based on those and other commonly used circuit-describing\nparameters. This characterization will help i) to perform an in-depth analysis\nof quantum circuits and their structure and group them based on similarities;\nii) to better understand and compare the mapping performance when run on a\nquantum processor and, later on, iii) to develop mapping techniques that use\ninformation from both, algorithms and quantum devices. Our simulation results\nshow a clear correlation between interaction graph-based parameters as well as\nclusters of circuits with their mapping performance metrics when considering\nthe constraints of a Surface-97 processor, as well as of IBM-53 Rochester and\nAspen-16 devices. In addition to that, we provide an up-to-date collection of\nquantum circuits and algorithms taken from well-known sources with the goal of\nhaving an all-gathering, easy-to-use, categorized and characterized benchmark\nset available for the quantum computing community.",

A number of approaches have\nbeen developed for this task, typically based either on universal data\ncompression algorithms, or on statistical estimators of the underlying process\ndistribution. In this work, we propose a fully-Bayesian approach for entropy\nestimation. Building on the recently introduced Bayesian Context Trees (BCT)\nframework for modelling discrete time series as variable-memory Markov chains,\nwe show that it is possible to sample directly from the induced posterior on\nthe entropy rate. This can be used to estimate the entire posterior\ndistribution, providing much richer information than point estimates.

    "abstract": "Sunquakes are seismic emissions visible on the solar surface, associated with\nsome solar flares. Although discovered in 1998, they have only recently become\na more commonly detected phenomenon. Despite the availability of several manual\ndetection guidelines, to our knowledge, the astrophysical data produced for\nsunquakes is new to the field of Machine Learning. Detecting sunquakes is a\ndaunting task for human operators and this work aims to ease and, if possible,\nto improve their detection. Thus, we introduce a dataset constructed from\nacoustic egression-power maps of solar active regions obtained for Solar Cycles\n23 and 24 using the holography method. We then present a pedagogical approach\nto the application of machine learning representation methods for sunquake\ndetection using AutoEncoders, Contrastive Learning, Object Detection and\nrecurrent techniques, which we enhance by introducing several custom\ndomain-specific data augmentation transformations. We address the main\nchallenges of the automated sunquake detection task, namely the very high noise\npatterns in and outside the active region shadow and the extreme class\nimbalance given by the limited number of frames that present sunquake\nsignatures. With our trained models, we find temporal and spatial locations of\npeculiar acoustic emission and qualitatively associate them to eruptive and\nhigh energy emission. While noting that these models are still in a prototype\nstage and there is much room for improvement in metrics and bias levels, we\nhypothesize that their agreement on example use cases has the potential to\nenable detection of weak solar acoustic manifestations.",

Even the least-squares regression has\nshown atypical features such as the model-wise double descent, and further\nworks have observed triple or multiple descents. Another important\ncharacteristic are the epoch-wise descent structures which emerge during\ntraining. The observations of model-wise and epoch-wise descents have been\nanalytically derived in limited theoretical settings (such as the random\nfeature model) and are otherwise experimental. In this work, we provide a full\nand unified analysis of the whole time-evolution of the generalization curve,\nin the asymptotic large-dimensional regime and under gradient-flow, within a\nwider theoretical setting stemming from a gaussian covariate model. In\nparticular, we cover most cases already disparately observed in the literature,\nand also provide examples of the existence of multiple descent structures as a\nfunction of a model parameter or time. Furthermore, we show that our\ntheoretical predictions adequately match the learning curves obtained by\ngradient descent over realistic datasets. Technically we compute averages of\nrational expressions involving random matrices using recent developments in\nrandom matrix theory based on \"linear pencils\".

When beliefs change, the stable network changes. We show that\nunder realistic settings, a regulator cannot pin down the changed beliefs that\ncaused the network changes. Also, each firm can use its view of the network to\ninform its beliefs. For instance, it can detect outlier firms whose beliefs\ndeviate from their peers.
