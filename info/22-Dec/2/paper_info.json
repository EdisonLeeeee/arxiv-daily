    "title": "Investigating the Feasibility of Virtual Reality for Emotion Regulation  with Youth",
    "abstract": "The ability to regulate and cope with strong emotions is essential for\nmaintaining our mental health and well-being. However, learning how to\nemotionally regulate can be a bit of a mystery since it is largely an invisible\nprocess and it can be difficult to conjure up strong emotions to practice\nregulating them. This is where virtual reality (or VR) comes in. VR is a\ncomputer-generated 3D environment where the user experiences a simulated world\nthrough 360 visuals, stereo audio, and 3D interaction with tracking sensors. VR\nis a very visceral experience that feels 'real' even though you know it isn't.\nIf a virtual ball came flying at your head, you would duck! My past research\nshows that we can provide VR experiences that elicit strong emotional reactions\nso that people can practice coping and regulating their emotional responses.\nFor example, I helped create a VR experience of being in nature and then going\ninto space to see the Earth; it created the emotional reaction of awe and\nwonder that led to a deeper connection with our planet. This shows that\nemotional VR experiences can impact our emotions and behaviour both in VR and\nbeyond. My research proposal is to investigate the feasibility of emotion\nregulation skills development in VR with teenagers. The idea is to simulate\nemotional experiences (like the 1st day of high school) as a means to develop\nemotion regulation skills so that they will be able to better cope with their\nemotions. I will lead the design, development, and evaluation of this VR\nexperience and work directly with youth to meet their needs. This proof of\nconcept prototype is the first step in developing a VR platform that provides\nyouth with an effective way to regulate their emotions and improve their mental\nhealth from their own homes, which will lead to improvements in education,\nsocio-emotional, and economic outcomes for youth in Canada and globally.",

    "abstract": "The Anthropocene is causing a global crisis in recent decades. Facing this\nchallenge, increasing attempts are being made to explore the\nmore-than-human-centred perspective in HCI and design. Our research sets out to\nexplore the ways of experiencing and interacting with plants with a case study\non the slowness of plants. Utilising existing time-lapse technology, we\ninvestigate the role of IoT technologies in associating biological slowness\nwith the networked technological environment of the home. In the experiment, we\nchose the humidity level of the environment as the variable to synchronise the\nmovement of smart curtains and plants. We propose a relationship-centred\nstrategy that uses an inclusive feature of a microclimate, like humidity,\ninstead of the plant itself, for human-plant interaction. Furthermore, it\nindicates a 'plant-decentred' perspective to spark critical reflection on the\ntaken-for-granted perception of isolating a person or a plant as an individual\nentity.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present some recommendations on the evaluation of\nstate-of-the-art generative models for constrained generation tasks. The\nprogress on generative models has been rapid in recent years. These large-scale\nmodels have had three impacts: firstly, the fluency of generation in both\nlanguage and vision modalities has rendered common average-case evaluation\nmetrics much less useful in diagnosing system errors. Secondly, the same\nsubstrate models now form the basis of a number of applications, driven both by\nthe utility of their representations as well as phenomena such as in-context\nlearning, which raise the abstraction level of interacting with such models.\nThirdly, the user expectations around these models and their feted public\nreleases have made the technical challenge of out of domain generalization much\nless excusable in practice. Subsequently, our evaluation methodologies haven't\nadapted to these changes. More concretely, while the associated utility and\nmethods of interacting with generative models have expanded, a similar\nexpansion has not been observed in their evaluation practices. In this paper,\nwe argue that the scale of generative models could be exploited to raise the\nabstraction level at which evaluation itself is conducted and provide\nrecommendations for the same. Our recommendations are based on leveraging\nspecifications as a powerful instrument to evaluate generation quality and are\nreadily applicable to a variety of tasks.",

    "abstract": "Due to the noises in crowdsourced labels, label aggregation (LA) has emerged\nas a standard procedure to post-process crowdsourced labels. LA methods\nestimate true labels from crowdsourced labels by modeling worker qualities.\nMost existing LA methods are iterative in nature. They need to traverse all the\ncrowdsourced labels multiple times in order to jointly and iteratively update\ntrue labels and worker qualities until convergence. Consequently, these methods\nhave high space and time complexities. In this paper, we treat LA as a dynamic\nsystem and model it as a Dynamic Bayesian network. From the dynamic model we\nderive two light-weight algorithms, LA\\textsuperscript{onepass} and\nLA\\textsuperscript{twopass}, which can effectively and efficiently estimate\nworker qualities and true labels by traversing all the labels at most twice.\nDue to the dynamic nature, the proposed algorithms can also estimate true\nlabels online without re-visiting historical data. We theoretically prove the\nconvergence property of the proposed algorithms, and bound the error of\nestimated worker qualities. We also analyze the space and time complexities of\nthe proposed algorithms and show that they are equivalent to those of majority\nvoting. Experiments conducted on 20 real-world datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed algorithms can effectively and efficiently aggregate labels in both\noffline and online settings even if they traverse all the labels at most twice.",

    "abstract": "Two combined numerical methods for solving time-varying semilinear\ndifferential-algebraic equations (DAEs) are obtained. These equations are also\ncalled degenerate DEs, descriptor systems, operator-differential equations and\nDEs on manifolds. The convergence and correctness of the methods are proved.\nWhen constructing methods we use, in particular, time-varying spectral\nprojectors which can be numerically found. This enables to numerically solve\nand analyze the considered DAE in the original form without additional\nanalytical transformations. To improve the accuracy of the second method,\nrecalculation (a ``predictor-corrector'' scheme) is used. Note that the\ndeveloped methods are applicable to the DAEs with the continuous nonlinear part\nwhich may not be continuously differentiable in $t$, and that the restrictions\nof the type of the global Lipschitz condition, including the global condition\nof contractivity, are not used in the theorems on the global solvability of the\nDAEs and on the convergence of the numerical methods. This enables to use the\ndeveloped methods for the numerical solution of more general classes of\nmathematical models. For example, the functions of currents and voltages in\nelectric circuits may not be differentiable or may be approximated by\nnondifferentiable functions. Presented conditions for the global solvability of\nthe DAEs ensure the existence of an unique exact global solution for the\ncorresponding initial value problem, which enables to compute approximate\nsolutions on any given time interval (provided that the conditions of theorems\nor remarks on the convergence of the methods are fulfilled). In the paper, the\nnumerical analysis of the mathematical model for a certain electrical circuit,\nwhich demonstrates the application of the presented theorems and numerical\nmethods, is carried out.",

Given the sheer magnitude of the\ncollected data and the significant challenges offered by the presence of highly\nsimilar genomic structure across species, there is a need for robust, scalable\nanalysis platforms to extract actionable knowledge such as the presence of\npotentially zoonotic pathogens. The emergence of zoonotic diseases from novel\npathogens, such as the influenza virus in 1918 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019 that can\njump species barriers and lead to pandemic underscores the need for scalable\nmetagenome analysis. In this work, we propose MG2Vec, a deep learning-based\nsolution that uses the transformer network as its backbone, to learn robust\nfeatures from raw metagenome sequences for downstream biomedical tasks such as\ntargeted and generalized pathogen detection. Extensive experiments on four\nincreasingly challenging, yet realistic diagnostic settings, show that the\nproposed approach can help detect pathogens from uncurated, real-world clinical\nsamples with minimal human supervision in the form of labels. Further, we\ndemonstrate that the learned representations can generalize to completely\nunrelated pathogens across diseases and species for large-scale metagenome\nanalysis.

Researchers have previously proposed methods to evaluate\nfootball team defense by predicting the events of ball gain and being attacked\nusing locations of all players and the ball. However, they did not consider the\nimportance of the events, assumed the perfect observation of all 22 players,\nand did not fully investigated the influence of the diversity (e.g.,\nnationality and sex). Here, we propose a generalized valuation method of\ndefensive teams by score-scaling the predicted probabilities of the events.\nUsing the open-source location data of all players in broadcast video frames in\nfootball games of men's Euro 2020 and women's Euro 2022, we investigated the\neffect of the number of players on the prediction and validated our approach by\nanalyzing the games.

However, existing architectures are designed for a single task but fail\nto multiplex different tasks in parallel within a single monolithic system due\nto the task competition that deteriorates the model performance. This paper\nproposes a novel optical multi-task learning system by designing\nmulti-wavelength diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) with the joint\noptimization method. By encoding multi-task inputs into multi-wavelength\nchannels, the system can increase the computing throughput and significantly\nalle-viate the competition to perform multiple tasks in parallel with high\naccuracy.

The numerical evaluations demonstrate that, under\nthe same network size, mul-ti-wavelength D2NNs achieve significantly higher\nclassification accuracies for multi-task learning than single-wavelength D2NNs.\nFurthermore, by increasing the network size, the multi-wavelength D2NNs for\nsimultaneously performing multiple tasks achieve comparable classification\naccuracies with respect to the individual training of multiple\nsingle-wavelength D2NNs to perform tasks separately.

    "abstract": "In recent years, semi-supervised graph learning with data augmentation (DA)\nis currently the most commonly used and best-performing method to enhance model\nrobustness in sparse scenarios with few labeled samples. Differing from\nhomogeneous graph, DA in heterogeneous graph has greater challenges:\nheterogeneity of information requires DA strategies to effectively handle\nheterogeneous relations, which considers the information contribution of\ndifferent types of neighbors and edges to the target nodes. Furthermore,\nover-squashing of information is caused by the negative curvature that formed\nby the non-uniformity distribution and strong clustering in complex graph. To\naddress these challenges, this paper presents a novel method named\nSemi-Supervised Heterogeneous Graph Learning with Multi-level Data Augmentation\n(HG-MDA). For the problem of heterogeneity of information in DA, node and\ntopology augmentation strategies are proposed for the characteristics of\nheterogeneous graph. And meta-relation-based attention is applied as one of the\nindexes for selecting augmented nodes and edges. For the problem of\nover-squashing of information, triangle based edge adding and removing are\ndesigned to alleviate the negative curvature and bring the gain of topology.\nFinally, the loss function consists of the cross-entropy loss for labeled data\nand the consistency regularization for unlabeled data. In order to effectively\nfuse the prediction results of various DA strategies, the sharpening is used.\nExisting experiments on public datasets, i.e., ACM, DBLP, OGB, and industry\ndataset MB show that HG-MDA outperforms current SOTA models. Additionly, HG-MDA\nis applied to user identification in internet finance scenarios, helping the\nbusiness to add 30% key users, and increase loans and balances by 3.6%, 11.1%,\nand 9.8%.",

(b) Secondly, we capitalize on the\nTransformer's inherent property to process information (visual tokens)\nextracted from irregular grids to devise a pipeline for face recognition which\nis reminiscent of part-based face recognition methods.

    "abstract": "Objective: Thigh muscle group segmentation is important for assessment of\nmuscle anatomy, metabolic disease and aging. Many efforts have been put into\nquantifying muscle tissues with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging including\nmanual annotation of individual muscles. However, leveraging publicly available\nannotations in MR images to achieve muscle group segmentation on single slice\ncomputed tomography (CT) thigh images is challenging.\nMethod: We propose an unsupervised domain adaptation pipeline with\nself-training to transfer labels from 3D MR to single CT slice. First, we\ntransform the image appearance from MR to CT with CycleGAN and feed the\nsynthesized CT images to a segmenter simultaneously. Single CT slices are\ndivided into hard and easy cohorts based on the entropy of pseudo labels\ninferenced by the segmenter. After refining easy cohort pseudo labels based on\nanatomical assumption, self-training with easy and hard splits is applied to\nfine tune the segmenter.\nResults: On 152 withheld single CT thigh images, the proposed pipeline\nachieved a mean Dice of 0.888(0.041) across all muscle groups including\nsartorius, hamstrings, quadriceps femoris and gracilis. muscles\nConclusion: To our best knowledge, this is the first pipeline to achieve\nthigh imaging domain adaptation from MR to CT.

    "abstract": "The integration of permissioned blockchain such as Hyperledger fabric (HF)\nand Industrial internet of Things (IIoT) has opened new opportunities for\ninterdependent supply chain partners to improve their performance through data\nsharing and coordination. The multichannel mechanism, private data collection\nand querying mechanism of HF enable private data sharing, transparency,\ntraceability, and verification across the supply chain. However, the existing\nquerying mechanism of HF needs further improvement for statistical data sharing\nbecause the query is evaluated on the original data recorded on the ledger. As\na result, it gives rise to privacy issues such as leak of business secrets,\ntracking of resources and assets, and disclose of personal information.\nTherefore, we solve this problem by proposing a differentially private enhanced\npermissioned blockchain for private data sharing in the context of supply chain\nin IIoT which is known as (EDH-IIoT). We propose an algorithms to efficiently\nutilize the $\\epsilon$ through the reuse of the privacy budget for the repeated\nqueries. Furthermore, the reuse and tracking of $\\epsilon$ enable the data\nowner to get ensure that $\\epsilon$ does not exceed the threshold which is the\nmaximum privacy budget ($\\epsilon_{t}$). Finally, we model two privacy attacks\nnamely linking attack and composition attack to evaluate and compare privacy\npreservation, and the efficiency of reuse of {\\epsilon} with the default\nchaincode of HF and traditional differential privacy model, respectively. The\nresults confirm that EDH-IIoT obtains an accuracy of 97% in the shared data for\n$\\epsilon_{t}$ = 1, and a reduction of 35.96% in spending of $\\epsilon$.",

CaRTS, based on a complementary causal\nmodel, has shown promising performance in unseen counterfactual surgical\nenvironments in the presence of smoke, blood, etc. However, CaRTS requires over\n30 iterations of optimization to converge for a single image due to limited\nobservability. Method: To address the above limitations, we take temporal\nrelation into consideration and propose a temporal causal model for robot tool\nsegmentation on video sequences. We design an architecture named Temporally\nConstrained CaRTS (TC-CaRTS). TC-CaRTS has three novel modules to complement\nCaRTS - temporal optimization pipeline, kinematics correction network, and\nspatial-temporal regularization. Results: Experiment results show that TC-CaRTS\nrequires much fewer iterations to achieve the same or better performance as\nCaRTS. TC- CaRTS also has the same or better performance in different domains\ncompared to CaRTS. All three modules are proven to be effective. Conclusion: We\npropose TC-CaRTS, which takes advantage of temporal constraints as additional\nobservability. We show that TC-CaRTS outperforms prior work in the robot tool\nsegmentation task with improved convergence speed on test datasets from\ndifferent domains.",

    "abstract": "Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is widely used in acceleration of deep\nlearning applications because of its reconfigurability, flexibility, and fast\ntime-to-market. However, conventional FPGA suffers from the tradeoff between\nchip area and reconfiguration latency, making efficient FPGA accelerations that\nrequire switching between multiple configurations still elusive. In this paper,\nwe perform technology-circuit-architecture co-design to break this tradeoff\nwith no additional area cost and lower power consumption compared with\nconventional designs while providing dynamic reconfiguration, which can hide\nthe reconfiguration time behind the execution time. Leveraging the intrinsic\ntransistor structure and non-volatility of ferroelectric FET (FeFET), compact\nFPGA primitives are proposed and experimentally verified, including 1FeFET\nlook-up table (LUT) cell, 1FeFET routing cell for connection blocks (CBs) and\nswitch boxes (SBs). To support dynamic reconfiguration, two local copies of\nprimitives are placed in parallel, which enables loading of arbitrary\nconfiguration without interrupting the active configuration execution. A\ncomprehensive evaluation shows that compared with the SRAM-based FPGA, our\ndynamic reconfiguration design shows 63.0%/71.1% reduction in LUT/CB area and\n82.7%/53.6% reduction in CB/SB power consumption with minimal penalty in the\ncritical path delay (9.6%). We further implement a Super-Sub network model to\nshow the benefit from the context-switching capability of our design. We also\nevaluate the timing performance of our design over conventional FPGA in various\napplication scenarios. In one scenario that users switch between two preloaded\nconfigurations, our design yields significant time saving by 78.7% on average.\nIn the other scenario of implementing multiple configurations with dynamic\nreconfiguration, our design offers time saving of 20.3% on average.",

To ease, models trained with large corpora\nare made available, and developers reuse them for different problems. In\ncontrast, developers mostly build their models from scratch for traditional\nDL-related problems. By doing so, they have control over the choice of\nalgorithms, data processing, model structure, tuning hyperparameters, etc.\nWhereas in NLP, due to the reuse of the pre-trained models, NLP developers are\nlimited to little to no control over such design decisions. They either apply\ntuning or transfer learning on pre-trained models to meet their requirements.\nAlso, NLP models and their corresponding datasets are significantly larger than\nthe traditional DL models and require heavy computation. Such reasons often\nlead to bugs in the system while reusing the pre-trained models. While bugs in\ntraditional DL software have been intensively studied, the nature of extensive\nreuse and black-box structure motivates us to understand the different types of\nbugs that occur while reusing NLP models?

    "abstract": "Communication enables agents to cooperate to achieve their goals. Learning\nwhen to communicate, i.e., sparse (in time) communication, and whom to message\nis particularly important when bandwidth is limited. Recent work in learning\nsparse individualized communication, however, suffers from high variance during\ntraining, where decreasing communication comes at the cost of decreased reward,\nparticularly in cooperative tasks. We use the information bottleneck to reframe\nsparsity as a representation learning problem, which we show naturally enables\nlossless sparse communication at lower budgets than prior art. In this paper,\nwe propose a method for true lossless sparsity in communication via Information\nMaximizing Gated Sparse Multi-Agent Communication (IMGS-MAC). Our model uses\ntwo individualized regularization objectives, an information maximization\nautoencoder and sparse communication loss, to create informative and sparse\ncommunication. We evaluate the learned communication `language' through direct\ncausal analysis of messages in non-sparse runs to determine the range of\nlossless sparse budgets, which allow zero-shot sparsity, and the range of\nsparse budgets that will inquire a reward loss, which is minimized by our\nlearned gating function with few-shot sparsity. To demonstrate the efficacy of\nour results, we experiment in cooperative multi-agent tasks where communication\nis essential for success. We evaluate our model with both continuous and\ndiscrete messages. We focus our analysis on a variety of ablations to show the\neffect of message representations, including their properties, and lossless\nperformance of our model.",

Previous works on risk in offline RL combine together offline\nRL techniques, to avoid distributional shift, with risk-sensitive RL\nalgorithms, to achieve risk-sensitivity. In this work, we propose\nrisk-sensitivity as a mechanism to jointly address both of these issues. Our\nmodel-based approach is risk-averse to both epistemic and aleatoric\nuncertainty. Risk-aversion to epistemic uncertainty prevents distributional\nshift, as areas not covered by the dataset have high epistemic uncertainty.\nRisk-aversion to aleatoric uncertainty discourages actions that may result in\npoor outcomes due to environment stochasticity.

    "abstract": "Differential private (DP) query and response mechanisms have been widely\nadopted in various applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) to leverage\nvariety of benefits through data analysis. The protection of sensitive\ninformation is achieved through the addition of noise into the query response\nwhich hides the individual records in a dataset. However, the noise addition\nnegatively impacts the accuracy which gives rise to privacy-utility trade-off.\nMoreover, the DP budget or cost $\\epsilon$ is often fixed and it accumulates\ndue to the sequential composition which limits the number of queries.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose a framework known as optimized\nprivacy-utility trade-off framework for data sharing in IoT (OPU-TF-IoT).\nFirstly, OPU-TF-IoT uses an adaptive approach to utilize the DP budget\n$\\epsilon$ by considering a new metric of population or dataset size along with\nthe query. Secondly, our proposed heuristic search algorithm reduces the DP\nbudget accordingly whereas satisfying both data owner and data user. Thirdly,\nto make the utilization of DP budget transparent to the data owners, a\nblockchain-based verification mechanism is also proposed. Finally, the proposed\nframework is evaluated using real-world datasets and compared with the\ntraditional DP model and other related state-of-the-art works.

    "abstract": "When analyzing confidential data through a privacy filter, a data scientist\noften needs to decide which queries will best support their intended analysis.\nFor example, an analyst may wish to study noisy two-way marginals in a dataset\nproduced by a mechanism M1. But, if the data are relatively sparse, the analyst\nmay choose to examine noisy one-way marginals, produced by a mechanism M2\ninstead. Since the choice of whether to use M1 or M2 is data-dependent, a\ntypical differentially private workflow is to first split the privacy loss\nbudget rho into two parts: rho1 and rho2, then use the first part rho1 to\ndetermine which mechanism to use, and the remainder rho2 to obtain noisy\nanswers from the chosen mechanism. In a sense, the first step seems wasteful\nbecause it takes away part of the privacy loss budget that could have been used\nto make the query answers more accurate.\nIn this paper, we consider the question of whether the choice between M1 and\nM2 can be performed without wasting any privacy loss budget. For linear\nqueries, we propose a method for decomposing M1 and M2 into three parts: (1) a\nmechanism M* that captures their shared information, (2) a mechanism M1' that\ncaptures information that is specific to M1, (3) a mechanism M2' that captures\ninformation that is specific to M2. Running M* and M1' together is completely\nequivalent to running M1 (both in terms of query answer accuracy and total\nprivacy cost rho). Similarly, running M* and M2' together is completely\nequivalent to running M2.\nSince M* will be used no matter what, the analyst can use its output to\ndecide whether to subsequently run M1'(thus recreating the analysis supported\nby M1) or M2'(recreating the analysis supported by M2), without wasting privacy\nloss budget.",

Content providers often utilise\nrecommendation systems as an efficacious approach for combating such\ninformation overload. This paper concentrates on developing a synthetic\napproach for recommending movies. Traditionally, movie recommendation systems\nuse either collaborative filtering, which utilises user interaction with the\nmedia, or content-based filtering, which makes use of the movie's available\nmetadata. Technological advancements have also introduced a hybrid technique\nthat integrates both systems. However, our approach deals solely with\ncontent-based recommendations, further enhancing it with a ranking algorithm\nbased on content similarity metrics. The three metrics contributing to the\nranking are similarity in metadata, visual content, and user reviews of the\nmovies. We use text vectorization followed by cosine similarity for metadata,\nfeature extraction by a pre-trained VGG19 followed by K-means clustering for\nvisual content, and a comparison of sentiments for user reviews.

In many cases, wireless packets to be transmitted\nhave deadlines that upper bound the times before their transmissions, to avoid\nstaleness of transmitted data. In this paper, motivated by emerging\napplications in security-critical communications, age of information, and\nmolecular communications, we expand the wireless packet scheduling framework to\nscenarios which involve strict limits on the time after transmission, in\naddition to the conventional pre-transmission delay constraints. As a result,\nwe introduce the scheduling problem under two-sided individual deadlines, which\ncaptures systems wherein transmitting too late (stale) and too early (fresh)\nare both undesired. Subject to said two-sided deadlines, we provably solve the\noptimal (energy-minimizing) offline packet scheduling problem.

Although these methods hold promise, human\ncomparison labeling is expensive and time consuming, constituting a major\nbottleneck to their broader applicability. Our insight is that we can greatly\nimprove how effectively human time is used in these approaches by batching\ncomparisons together, rather than having the human label each comparison\nindividually. To do so, we leverage data dimensionality-reduction and\nvisualization techniques to provide the human with a interactive GUI displaying\nthe state space, in which the user can label subportions of the state space.\nAcross some simple Mujoco tasks, we show that this high-level approach holds\npromise and is able to greatly increase the performance of the resulting\nagents, provided the same amount of human labeling time.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the problem of Embodied Referring Expression\nGrounding, where an agent needs to navigate in a previously unseen environment\nand localize a remote object described by a concise high-level natural language\ninstruction. When facing such a situation, a human tends to imagine what the\ndestination may look like and to explore the environment based on prior\nknowledge of the environmental layout, such as the fact that a bathroom is more\nlikely to be found near a bedroom than a kitchen. We have designed an\nautonomous agent called Layout-aware Dreamer (LAD), including two novel\nmodules, that is, the Layout Learner and the Goal Dreamer to mimic this\ncognitive decision process. The Layout Learner learns to infer the room\ncategory distribution of neighboring unexplored areas along the path for coarse\nlayout estimation, which effectively introduces layout common sense of\nroom-to-room transitions to our agent. To learn an effective exploration of the\nenvironment, the Goal Dreamer imagines the destination beforehand. Our agent\nachieves new state-of-the-art performance on the public leaderboard of the\nREVERIE dataset in challenging unseen test environments with improvement in\nnavigation success (SR) by 4.02% and remote grounding success (RGS) by 3.43%\ncompared to the previous state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised anomaly detection is a common problem, as often the datasets\ncontaining anomalies are partially labeled. We propose a canonical framework:\nSemi-supervised Pseudo-labeler Anomaly Detection with Ensembling (SPADE) that\nisn't limited by the assumption that labeled and unlabeled data come from the\nsame distribution. Indeed, the assumption is often violated in many\napplications - for example, the labeled data may contain only anomalies unlike\nunlabeled data, or unlabeled data may contain different types of anomalies, or\nlabeled data may contain only 'easy-to-label' samples. SPADE utilizes an\nensemble of one class classifiers as the pseudo-labeler to improve the\nrobustness of pseudo-labeling with distribution mismatch. Partial matching is\nproposed to automatically select the critical hyper-parameters for\npseudo-labeling without validation data, which is crucial with limited labeled\ndata. SPADE shows state-of-the-art semi-supervised anomaly detection\nperformance across a wide range of scenarios with distribution mismatch in both\ntabular and image domains. In some common real-world settings such as model\nfacing new types of unlabeled anomalies, SPADE outperforms the state-of-the-art\nalternatives by 5% AUC in average.",

In\nthis work, we conduct a comprehensive, multidisciplinary survey of the field of\nanimal and machine curiosity. As a principal contribution of this work, we use\nthis survey as a foundation to introduce and define what we consider to be five\nof the most important properties of specific curiosity: 1) directedness towards\ninostensible referents, 2) cessation when satisfied, 3) voluntary exposure, 4)\ntransience, and 5) coherent long-term learning. As a second main contribution\nof this work, we show how these properties may be implemented together in a\nproof-of-concept reinforcement learning agent: we demonstrate how the\nproperties manifest in the behaviour of this agent in a simple non-episodic\ngrid-world environment that includes curiosity-inducing locations and induced\ntargets of curiosity. As we would hope, our example of a computational specific\ncuriosity agent exhibits short-term directed behaviour while updating long-term\npreferences to adaptively seek out curiosity-inducing situations. This work,\ntherefore, presents a landmark synthesis and translation of specific curiosity\nto the domain of machine learning and reinforcement learning and provides a\nnovel view into how specific curiosity operates and in the future might be\nintegrated into the behaviour of goal-seeking, decision-making computational\nagents in complex environments.",

    "abstract": "Synthesizing high-fidelity videos from real-world multi-view input is\nchallenging because of the complexities of real-world environments and highly\ndynamic motions. Previous works based on neural radiance fields have\ndemonstrated high-quality reconstructions of dynamic scenes. However, training\nsuch models on real-world scenes is time-consuming, usually taking days or\nweeks. In this paper, we present a novel method named MixVoxels to better\nrepresent the dynamic scenes with fast training speed and competitive rendering\nqualities. The proposed MixVoxels represents the 4D dynamic scenes as a mixture\nof static and dynamic voxels and processes them with different networks. In\nthis way, the computation of the required modalities for static voxels can be\nprocessed by a lightweight model, which essentially reduces the amount of\ncomputation, especially for many daily dynamic scenes dominated by the static\nbackground. To separate the two kinds of voxels, we propose a novel variation\nfield to estimate the temporal variance of each voxel. For the dynamic voxels,\nwe design an inner-product time query method to efficiently query multiple time\nsteps, which is essential to recover the high-dynamic motions. As a result,\nwith 15 minutes of training for dynamic scenes with inputs of 300-frame videos,\nMixVoxels achieves better PSNR than previous methods.

The proposed option discovery algorithm is extensively\nevaluated using challenging tasks built with Mujoco and Atari, demonstrating\nthat our proposed algorithm substantially outperforms SOTA baselines from both\ndiversity- and coverage-driven categories.

In this paper, we propose a method for\nthe uncertainty estimation for multi-class image classification using test-time\nmixup augmentation (TTMA). To improve the discrimination ability between the\ncorrect and incorrect prediction of the existing aleatoric uncertainty, we\npropose the data uncertainty by applying the mixup augmentation on the test\ndata and measuring the entropy of the histogram of predicted labels. In\naddition to the data uncertainty, we propose a class-specific uncertainty\npresenting the aleatoric uncertainty associated with the specific class, which\ncan provide information on the class confusion and class similarity of the\ntrained network. The proposed methods are validated on two public datasets, the\nISIC-18 skin lesion diagnosis dataset, and the CIFAR-100 real-world image\nclassification dataset. The experiments demonstrate that (1) the proposed data\nuncertainty better separates the correct and incorrect prediction than the\nexisting uncertainty measures thanks to the mixup perturbation, and (2) the\nproposed class-specific uncertainty provides information on the class confusion\nand class similarity of the trained network for both datasets.",

Deep neural networks (DNNs)\nlearn millions of parameters associated with a series of transformations\ndefined by the model architecture, resulting in high-dimensional,\ndifficult-to-interpret internal representations of input data. As DNNs become\nmore ubiquitous across multiple sectors of our society, there is increasing\nrecognition that mathematical methods are needed to aid analysts, researchers,\nand practitioners in understanding and interpreting how these models' internal\nrepresentations relate to the final classification. In this paper, we apply\ncutting edge techniques from TDA with the goal of gaining insight into the\ninterpretability of convolutional neural networks used for image\nclassification. We use two common TDA approaches to explore several methods for\nmodeling hidden-layer activations as high-dimensional point clouds, and provide\nexperimental evidence that these point clouds capture valuable structural\ninformation about the model's process. First, we demonstrate that a distance\nmetric based on persistent homology can be used to quantify meaningful\ndifferences between layers, and we discuss these distances in the broader\ncontext of existing representational similarity metrics for neural network\ninterpretability. Second, we show that a mapper graph can provide semantic\ninsight into how these models organize hierarchical class knowledge at each\nlayer.

Different needs correspond to different IR tasks such as document\nretrieval, open-domain question answering, retrieval-based dialogue, etc.,\nwhile they share the same schema to estimate the relationship between texts. It\nindicates that a good IR model can generalize to different tasks and domains.\nHowever, previous studies indicate that state-of-the-art neural information\nretrieval (NIR) models, e.g, pre-trained language models (PLMs) are hard to\ngeneralize. Mainly because the end-to-end fine-tuning paradigm makes the model\noveremphasize task-specific signals and domain biases but loses the ability to\ncapture generalized essential signals. To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel NIR training framework named NIR-Prompt for retrieval and reranking\nstages based on the idea of decoupling signal capturing and combination.\nNIR-Prompt exploits Essential Matching Module (EMM) to capture the essential\nmatching signals and gets the description of tasks by Matching Description\nModule (MDM).

In this\nconcept paper, we view scientific discovery as an interplay between $thinking \\\nout \\ of \\ the \\ box$ that actively seeks insightful solutions and $thinking \\\ninside \\ the \\ box$ that generalizes on conceptual domain knowledge to keep\ncorrect. Accordingly, we propose Mindle, a semantic searching game that\ntriggers scientific-discovery-like thinking spontaneously, as infrastructure\nfor exploring scientific discovery on a large scale. On this basis, the\nmeta-strategies for insights and the usage of concepts can be investigated\nreciprocally. In the pilot studies, several interesting observations inspire\nelaborated hypotheses on meta-strategies, context, and individual diversity for\nfurther investigations.",

    "abstract": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) models often perform poorly on\nout-of-distribution data and struggle on domain generalization. Due to the\nmulti-modal nature of this task, multiple factors of variation are intertwined,\nmaking generalization difficult to analyze. This motivates us to introduce a\nvirtual benchmark, Super-CLEVR, where different factors in VQA domain shifts\ncan be isolated in order that their effects can be studied independently. Four\nfactors are considered: visual complexity, question redundancy, concept\ndistribution and concept compositionality. With controllably generated data,\nSuper-CLEVR enables us to test VQA methods in situations where the test data\ndiffers from the training data along each of these axes. We study four existing\nmethods, including two neural symbolic methods NSCL and NSVQA, and two\nnon-symbolic methods FiLM and mDETR; and our proposed method, probabilistic\nNSVQA (P-NSVQA), which extends NSVQA with uncertainty reasoning. P-NSVQA\noutperforms other methods on three of the four domain shift factors. Our\nresults suggest that disentangling reasoning and perception, combined with\nprobabilistic uncertainty, form a strong VQA model that is more robust to\ndomain shifts.

    "abstract": "When developing deep learning models, we usually decide what task we want to\nsolve then search for a model that generalizes well on the task. An intriguing\nquestion would be: what if, instead of fixing the task and searching in the\nmodel space, we fix the model and search in the task space? Can we find tasks\nthat the model generalizes on? How do they look, or do they indicate anything?\nThese are the questions we address in this paper.\nWe propose a task discovery framework that automatically finds examples of\nsuch tasks via optimizing a generalization-based quantity called agreement\nscore. We demonstrate that one set of images can give rise to many tasks on\nwhich neural networks generalize well. These tasks are a reflection of the\ninductive biases of the learning framework and the statistical patterns present\nin the data, thus they can make a useful tool for analysing the neural networks\nand their biases. As an example, we show that the discovered tasks can be used\nto automatically create adversarial train-test splits which make a model fail\nat test time, without changing the pixels or labels, but by only selecting how\nthe datapoints should be split between the train and test sets. We end with a\ndiscussion on human-interpretability of the discovered tasks.",

    "abstract": "Since higher-order tensors are naturally suitable for representing\nmulti-dimensional data in real-world, e.g., color images and videos, low-rank\ntensor representation has become one of the emerging areas in machine learning\nand computer vision. However, classical low-rank tensor representations can\nonly represent data on finite meshgrid due to their intrinsical discrete\nnature, which hinders their potential applicability in many scenarios beyond\nmeshgrid. To break this barrier, we propose a low-rank tensor function\nrepresentation (LRTFR), which can continuously represent data beyond meshgrid\nwith infinite resolution. Specifically, the suggested tensor function, which\nmaps an arbitrary coordinate to the corresponding value, can continuously\nrepresent data in an infinite real space. Parallel to discrete tensors, we\ndevelop two fundamental concepts for tensor functions, i.e., the tensor\nfunction rank and low-rank tensor function factorization. We theoretically\njustify that both low-rank and smooth regularizations are harmoniously unified\nin the LRTFR, which leads to high effectiveness and efficiency for data\ncontinuous representation. Extensive multi-dimensional data recovery\napplications arising from image processing (image inpainting and denoising),\nmachine learning (hyperparameter optimization), and computer graphics (point\ncloud upsampling) substantiate the superiority and versatility of our method as\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods. Especially, the experiments beyond the\noriginal meshgrid resolution (hyperparameter optimization) or even beyond\nmeshgrid (point cloud upsampling) validate the favorable performances of our\nmethod for continuous representation.",

Gaussian Processes (GPs) are used to model the dynamics of\nthe safety-critical system, which is subsequently used in the GP-BaS model. We\nderive the barrier state dynamics utilizing the GP posterior, which is used to\nconstruct a safety embedded Gaussian process dynamical model (GPDM).

    "abstract": "Generative models for learning combinatorial structures have transformative\nimpacts in many applications. However, existing approaches fail to offer\nefficient and accurate learning results. Because of the highly intractable\nnature of the gradient estimation of the learning objective subject to\ncombinatorial constraints. Existing gradient estimation methods would easily\nrun into exponential time/memory space, or incur huge estimation errors due to\nimproper approximation. We develop NEural Lovasz Sampler (Nelson), a neural\nnetwork based on Lov\\'asz Local Lemma (LLL). We show it guarantees to generate\nsamples satisfying combinatorial constraints from the distribution of the\nconstrained Markov Random Fields model (MRF) under certain conditions. We\nfurther present a fully differentiable contrastive-divergence-based learning\nframework on constrained MRF (Nelson-CD). Meanwhile, Nelson-CD being fully\ndifferentiable allows us to take advantage of the parallel computing power of\nGPUs, resulting in great efficiency. Experimental results on three real-world\ncombinatorial problems reveal that Nelson learns to generate 100% valid\nstructures. In comparison, baselines either time out on large-size data sets or\nfail to generate valid structures, whereas Nelson scales much better with\nproblem size. In addition, Nelson outperforms baselines in various learning\nmetrics, such as log-likelihood and MAP scores.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the political polarity of news headlines is a challenging task\nthat becomes even more challenging in a multilingual setting with low-resource\nlanguages. To deal with this, we propose to utilise the Inferential Commonsense\nKnowledge via a Translate-Retrieve-Translate strategy to introduce a learning\nframework. To begin with, we use the method of translation and retrieval to\nacquire the inferential knowledge in the target language. We then employ an\nattention mechanism to emphasise important inferences. We finally integrate the\nattended inferences into a multilingual pre-trained language model for the task\nof bias prediction. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we present\na dataset of over 62.6K multilingual news headlines in five European languages\nannotated with their respective political polarities. We evaluate several\nstate-of-the-art multilingual pre-trained language models since their\nperformance tends to vary across languages (low/high resource). Evaluation\nresults demonstrate that our proposed framework is effective regardless of the\nmodels employed. Overall, the best performing model trained with only headlines\nshow 0.90 accuracy and F1, and 0.83 jaccard score. With attended knowledge in\nour framework, the same model show an increase in 2.2% accuracy and F1, and\n3.6% jaccard score. Extending our experiments to individual languages reveals\nthat the models we analyze for Slovenian perform significantly worse than other\nlanguages in our dataset. To investigate this, we assess the effect of\ntranslation quality on prediction performance. It indicates that the disparity\nin performance is most likely due to poor translation quality. We release our\ndataset and scripts at: https://github.com/Swati17293/KG-Multi-Bias for future\nresearch. Our framework has the potential to benefit journalists, social\nscientists, news producers, and consumers.",

    "abstract": "Many NLP tasks can be regarded as a selection problem from a set of options,\nsuch as classification tasks, multi-choice question answering, etc. Textual\nentailment (TE) has been shown as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach to\ndealing with those selection problems. TE treats input texts as premises (P),\noptions as hypotheses (H), then handles the selection problem by modeling (P,\nH) pairwise. Two limitations: first, the pairwise modeling is unaware of other\noptions, which is less intuitive since humans often determine the best options\nby comparing competing candidates; second, the inference process of pairwise TE\nis time-consuming, especially when the option space is large. To deal with the\ntwo issues, this work first proposes a contextualized TE model (Context-TE) by\nappending other k options as the context of the current (P, H) modeling.\nContext-TE is able to learn more reliable decision for the H since it considers\nvarious context. Second, we speed up Context-TE by coming up with Parallel-TE,\nwhich learns the decisions of multiple options simultaneously. Parallel-TE\nsignificantly improves the inference speed while keeping comparable performance\nwith Context-TE. Our methods are evaluated on three tasks (ultra-fine entity\ntyping, intent detection and multi-choice QA) that are typical selection\nproblems with different sizes of options. Experiments show our models set new\nSOTA performance; particularly, Parallel-TE is faster than the pairwise TE by k\ntimes in inference.

    "abstract": "Vertical federated learning is a trending solution for multi-party\ncollaboration in training machine learning models. Industrial frameworks adopt\nsecure multi-party computation methods such as homomorphic encryption to\nguarantee data security and privacy. However, a line of work has revealed that\nthere are still leakage risks in VFL. The leakage is caused by the correlation\nbetween the intermediate representations and the raw data. Due to the powerful\napproximation ability of deep neural networks, an adversary can capture the\ncorrelation precisely and reconstruct the data. To deal with the threat of the\ndata reconstruction attack, we propose a hashing-based VFL framework, called\n\\textit{HashVFL}, to cut off the reversibility directly. The one-way nature of\nhashing allows our framework to block all attempts to recover data from hash\ncodes. However, integrating hashing also brings some challenges, e.g., the loss\nof information. This paper proposes and addresses three challenges to\nintegrating hashing: learnability, bit balance, and consistency. Experimental\nresults demonstrate \\textit{HashVFL}'s efficiency in keeping the main task's\nperformance and defending against data reconstruction attacks. Furthermore, we\nalso analyze its potential value in detecting abnormal inputs. In addition, we\nconduct extensive experiments to prove \\textit{HashVFL}'s generalization in\nvarious settings.

As one way to implement privacy-preserving AI,\ndifferentially private learning is a framework that enables AI models to use\ndifferential privacy (DP). To achieve DP in the learning process, existing\nalgorithms typically limit the magnitude of gradients with a constant clipping,\nwhich requires carefully tuned due to its significant impact on model\nperformance. As a solution to this issue, latest works NSGD and Auto-S\ninnovatively propose to use normalization instead of clipping to avoid\nhyperparameter tuning. However, normalization-based approaches like NSGD and\nAuto-S rely on a monotonic weight function, which imposes excessive weight on\nsmall gradient samples and introduces extra deviation to the update. In this\npaper, we propose a Differentially Private Per-Sample Adaptive Clipping\n(DP-PSAC) algorithm based on a non-monotonic adaptive weight function, which\nguarantees privacy without the typical hyperparameter tuning process of using a\nconstant clipping while significantly reducing the deviation between the update\nand true batch-averaged gradient. We provide a rigorous theoretical convergence\nanalysis and show that with convergence rate at the same order, the proposed\nalgorithm achieves a lower non-vanishing bound, which is maintained over\ntraining iterations, compared with NSGD/Auto-S.

    "abstract": "Emotions play an important role in interpersonal interactions and social\nconflict, yet their function in the development of controversy and disagreement\nin online conversations has not been explored. To address this gap, we study\ncontroversy on Reddit, a popular network of online discussion forums. We\ncollect discussions from a wide variety of topical forums and use emotion\ndetection to recognize a range of emotions from text, including anger, fear,\njoy, admiration, etc. Our study has three main findings. First, controversial\ncomments express more anger and less admiration, joy and optimism than\nnon-controversial comments. Second, controversial comments affect emotions of\ndownstream comments in a discussion, usually resulting in long-term increase in\nanger and a decrease in positive emotions, although the magnitude and direction\nof emotional change depends on the forum. Finally, we show that emotions help\nbetter predict which comments will become controversial. Understanding\nemotional dynamics of online discussions can help communities to better manage\nconversations.",

The second\nfunction is self-attention, capturing the long-range dependencies of feature\nmap by the channel-wise and spatial-wise attention mechanism. We named this\nmethod as self-proliferation-and-attention neural network. This method has been\nsuccessfully applied to various defect pattern classification tasks.

The method overcomes the inconsistency issue widely present in the\nconventional 2nd order staggered grid finite difference scheme over nonuniform\ngrid, achieving high accuracy with arbitrarily high order scheme.

The\ngrid stretching in our method reduces the number of grid points required in the\ndiscretization, making it more efficient than the standard high-order FDTD with\na densely sampled uniform grid. Instead of stretching in both vertical and\nhorizontal directions, better accuracy of our method is observed when the grid\nis stretched along the depth without horizontal stretching.

    "abstract": "3D reconstruction from videos has become increasingly popular for various\napplications, including navigation for autonomous driving of robots and drones,\naugmented reality (AR), and 3D modeling. This task often combines traditional\nimage/video processing algorithms and deep neural networks (DNNs). Although\nrecent developments in deep learning have improved the accuracy of the task,\nthe large number of calculations involved results in low computation speed and\nhigh power consumption. Although there are various domain-specific hardware\naccelerators for DNNs, it is not easy to accelerate the entire process of\napplications that alternate between traditional image/video processing\nalgorithms and DNNs. Thus, FPGA-based end-to-end acceleration is required for\nsuch complicated applications in low-power embedded environments.\nThis paper proposes a novel FPGA-based accelerator for DeepVideoMVS, a\nDNN-based depth estimation method for 3D reconstruction. We employ HW/SW\nco-design to appropriately utilize heterogeneous components in modern SoC\nFPGAs, such as programmable logic (PL) and CPU, according to the inherent\ncharacteristics of the method. As some operations are unsuitable for hardware\nimplementation, we determine the operations to be implemented in software\nthrough analyzing the number of times each operation is performed and its\nmemory access pattern, and then considering comprehensive aspects: the ease of\nhardware implementation and degree of expected acceleration by hardware. The\nhardware and software implementations are executed in parallel on the PL and\nCPU to hide their execution latencies. The proposed accelerator was developed\non a Xilinx ZCU104 board by using NNgen, an open-source high-level synthesis\n(HLS) tool. Experiments showed that the proposed accelerator operates 60.2\ntimes faster than the software-only implementation on the same FPGA board with\nminimal accuracy degradation.",

In terms of privacy, SPOT supports both anonymity\nof users being in proximity of infected people and unlinkability of contact\ninformation issued by the same user. A concrete construction based on\nstructure-preserving signatures and NIWI proofs is proposed and a detailed\nsecurity and privacy analysis proves that SPOT is secure under standard\nassumptions.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a technique to train a robot to perform kick-motion in AI\nsoccer by using reinforcement learning (RL). In RL, an agent interacts with an\nenvironment and learns to choose an action in a state at each step. When\ntraining RL algorithms, a problem called the curse of dimensionality (COD) can\noccur if the dimension of the state is high and the number of training data is\nlow. The COD often causes degraded performance of RL models. In the situation\nof the robot kicking the ball, as the ball approaches the robot, the robot\nchooses the action based on the information obtained from the soccer field. In\norder not to suffer COD, the training data, which are experiences in the case\nof RL, should be collected evenly from all areas of the soccer field over\n(theoretically infinite) time. In this paper, we attempt to use the relative\ncoordinate system (RCS) as the state for training kick-motion of robot agent,\ninstead of using the absolute coordinate system (ACS). Using the RCS eliminates\nthe necessity for the agent to know all the (state) information of entire\nsoccer field and reduces the dimension of the state that the agent needs to\nknow to perform kick-motion, and consequently alleviates COD. The training\nbased on the RCS is performed with the widely used Deep Q-network (DQN) and\ntested in the AI Soccer environment implemented with Webots simulation\nsoftware.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel antialiasing method to increase shift invariance in\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). More precisely, we replace the\nconventional combination \"real-valued convolutions + max pooling\" ($\\mathbb\nR$Max) by \"complex-valued convolutions + modulus\" ($\\mathbb C$Mod), which\nproduce stable feature representations for band-pass filters with well-defined\norientations. In a recent work, we proved that, for such filters, the two\noperators yield similar outputs. Therefore, $\\mathbb C$Mod can be viewed as a\nstable alternative to $\\mathbb R$Max. To separate band-pass filters from other\nfreely-trained kernels, in this paper, we designed a \"twin\" architecture based\non the dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform, which generates similar\noutputs as standard CNNs with fewer trainable parameters. In addition to\nimproving stability to small shifts, our experiments on AlexNet and ResNet\nshowed increased prediction accuracy on natural image datasets such as ImageNet\nand CIFAR10. Furthermore, our approach outperformed recent antialiasing methods\nbased on low-pass filtering by preserving high-frequency information, while\nreducing memory usage.",

The scope of our\napproach is to blend covariance steering theory, distributed optimization and\nmodel predictive control (MPC) into a single methodology that is safe, scalable\nand decentralized. Initially, we pose a problem formulation that uses the\nWasserstein distance to steer the state distributions of a multi-robot team to\ndesired targets, and probabilistic constraints to ensure safety. We then\ntransform this problem into a finite-dimensional optimization one by utilizing\na disturbance feedback policy parametrization for covariance steering and a\ntractable approximation of the safety constraints. To solve the latter problem,\nwe derive a decentralized consensus-based algorithm using the Alternating\nDirection Method of Multipliers (ADMM). This method is then extended to a\nreceding horizon form, which yields the proposed DMPCS algorithm. Simulation\nexperiments on large-scale problems with up to hundreds of robots successfully\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of DMPCS.

    "abstract": "Deep transfer learning (DTL) has formed a long-term quest toward enabling\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) to reuse historical experiences as efficiently as\nhumans. This ability is named knowledge transferability. A commonly used\nparadigm for DTL is firstly learning general knowledge (pre-training) and then\nreusing (fine-tuning) them for a specific target task. There are two\nconsensuses of transferability of pre-trained DNNs: (1) a larger domain gap\nbetween pre-training and downstream data brings lower transferability; (2) the\ntransferability gradually decreases from lower layers (near input) to higher\nlayers (near output). However, these consensuses were basically drawn from the\nexperiments based on natural images, which limits their scope of application.\nThis work aims to study and complement them from a broader perspective by\nproposing a method to measure the transferability of pre-trained DNN\nparameters. Our experiments on twelve diverse image classification datasets get\nsimilar conclusions to the previous consensuses. More importantly, two new\nfindings are presented, i.e., (1) in addition to the domain gap, a larger data\namount and huge dataset diversity of downstream target task also prohibit the\ntransferability; (2) although the lower layers learn basic image features, they\nare usually not the most transferable layers due to their domain sensitivity.",

However, insect populations are declining, calling for a necessary\nglobal demand of insect monitoring. Existing methods analyze video or\ntime-lapse images of insects in nature, but the analysis is challenging since\ninsects are small objects in complex and dynamic scenes of natural vegetation.\nThe current paper provides a dataset of primary honeybees visiting three\ndifferent plant species during two months of summer-period. The dataset\nconsists of more than 700,000 time-lapse images from multiple cameras,\nincluding more than 100,000 annotated images. The paper presents a new method\npipeline for detecting insects in time-lapse RGB-images. The pipeline consists\nof a two-step process. Firstly, the time-lapse RGB-images are preprocessed to\nenhance insects in the images. We propose a new prepossessing enhancement\nmethod: Motion-Informed-enhancement. The technique uses motion and colors to\nenhance insects in images. The enhanced images are subsequently fed into a\nConvolutional Neural network (CNN) object detector. Motion-Informed-enhancement\nimproves the deep learning object detectors You Only Look Once (YOLO) and\nFaster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN). Using\nMotion-Informed-enhancement the YOLO-detector improves average micro F1-score\nfrom 0.49 to 0.71, and the Faster R-CNN-detector improves average micro\nF1-score from 0.32 to 0.56 on the our dataset.

A\ngood analysis can, for example, determine whether one medical treatment for a\ngroup of patients is better than another. With the rise of machine learning,\nsurvival analysis can be modeled as learning a function that maps studied\npatients to their survival times. To succeed with that, there are three crucial\nissues to be tackled. First, some patient data is censored: we do not know the\ntrue survival times for all patients. Second, data is scarce, which led past\nresearch to treat different illness types as domains in a multi-task setup.\nThird, there is the need for adaptation to new or extremely rare illness types,\nwhere little or no labels are available. In contrast to previous multi-task\nsetups, we want to investigate how to efficiently adapt to a new survival\ntarget domain from multiple survival source domains. For this, we introduce a\nnew survival metric and the corresponding discrepancy measure between survival\ndistributions. These allow us to define domain adaptation for survival analysis\nwhile incorporating censored data, which would otherwise have to be dropped.\nOur experiments on two cancer data sets reveal a superb performance on target\ndomains, a better treatment recommendation, and a weight matrix with a\nplausible explanation.",

This paper considers a framework\nwhere the possibly overparametrized model includes fake features, i.e.,\nfeatures that are present in the model but not in the data. We present a\nnon-asymptotic high-probability bound on the generalization error of the ridge\nregression problem under the model misspecification of having fake features.\nOur high-probability results characterize the interplay between the implicit\nregularization provided by the fake features and the explicit regularization\nprovided by the ridge parameter.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel 3D object detection architecture, which can encode\nLiDAR point cloud sequences acquired by multiple successive scans. The encoding\nprocess of the point cloud sequence is performed on two different time scales.\nWe first design a short-term motion-aware voxel encoding that captures the\nshort-term temporal changes of point clouds driven by the motion of objects in\neach voxel. We also propose long-term motion-guided bird's eye view (BEV)\nfeature enhancement that adaptively aligns and aggregates the BEV feature maps\nobtained by the short-term voxel encoding by utilizing the dynamic motion\ncontext inferred from the sequence of the feature maps.

    "abstract": "With the wide application of stereo images in various fields, the research on\nstereo image compression (SIC) attracts extensive attention from academia and\nindustry. The core of SIC is to fully explore the mutual information between\nthe left and right images and reduce redundancy between views as much as\npossible. In this paper, we propose DispSIC, an end-to-end trainable deep\nneural network, in which we jointly train a stereo matching model to assist in\nthe image compression task. Based on the stereo matching results (i.e.\ndisparity), the right image can be easily warped to the left view, and only the\nresiduals between the left and right views are encoded for the left image. A\nthree-branch auto-encoder architecture is adopted in DispSIC, which encodes the\nright image, the disparity map and the residuals respectively. During training,\nthe whole network can learn how to adaptively allocate bitrates to these three\nparts, achieving better rate-distortion performance at the cost of a lower\ndisparity map bitrates. Moreover, we propose a conditional entropy model with\naligned cross-view priors for SIC, which takes the warped latents of the right\nimage as priors to improve the accuracy of the probability estimation for the\nleft image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves\nsuperior performance compared to other existing SIC methods on the KITTI and\nInStereo2K datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

One important consequence is that decision makers must seek to\nguarantee a 'fair', i.e., non-discriminatory, algorithmic decision procedure.\nHowever, there are several competing notions of algorithmic fairness that have\nbeen shown to be mutually incompatible under realistic factual assumptions.\nThis concerns, for example, the widely used fairness measures of 'calibration\nwithin groups' and 'balance for the positive/negative class'. In this paper, we\npresent a novel algorithm (FAir Interpolation Method: FAIM) for continuously\ninterpolating between these three fairness criteria. Thus, an initially unfair\nprediction can be remedied to, at least partially, meet a desired, weighted\ncombination of the respective fairness conditions.

If reflex loops deliver sensory information with significant delays,\none would expect a destabilizing effect on sensorimotor control. Hence, an\nalternative explanation describes a hierarchical structure of low-level\nadaptive mechanics and high-level sensorimotor control to help mitigate the\neffects of transmission delays. Motivated by the concept of an adaptive\nmechanism triggering an immediate response, we developed a tunable physical\ndamper system.

The slack damper allows adjustment of damping\nforce, onset timing, effective stroke, and energy dissipation. We characterize\nthe slack damper mechanism mounted to a legged robot controlled in open-loop\nmode. The robot hops vertically and planar over varying terrains and\nperturbations. During forward hopping, slack-based damping improves faster\nperturbation recovery (up to 170%) at higher energetic cost (27%).

In our method for accelerating ZNCC, target images are\nscanned in a zigzag fashion to efficiently reuse one pixel's computation for\nits neighboring pixels; this reduces the amount of data transmission and\nincreases the utilization of on-chip registers, thus increasing the processing\nspeed. As a result, our method is 2X faster than the traditional image scanning\nmethod, and 26% faster than the latest NCC method. By combining this technique\nwith the domain transformation (DT) algorithm, our system show real-time\nprocessing speed of 32 fps, on a Jetson Tx2 GPU for 1,280x384 pixel images with\na maximum disparity of 128. Additionally, the evaluation results on the KITTI\n2015 benchmark show that our combined system is more accurate than the same\nalgorithm combined with census by 7.26%, while maintaining almost the same\nprocessing speed.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring safety is of paramount importance in physical human-robot\ninteraction applications. This requires both an adherence to safety constraints\ndefined on the system state, as well as guaranteeing compliant behaviour of the\nrobot. If the underlying dynamical system is known exactly, the former can be\naddressed with the help of control barrier functions. Incorporation of elastic\nactuators in the robot's mechanical design can address the latter requirement.\nHowever, this elasticity can increase the complexity of the resulting system,\nleading to unmodeled dynamics, such that control barrier functions cannot\ndirectly ensure safety. In this paper, we mitigate this issue by learning the\nunknown dynamics using Gaussian process regression. By employing the model in a\nfeedback linearizing control law, the safety conditions resulting from control\nbarrier functions can be robustified to take into account model errors, while\nremaining feasible. In order enforce them on-line, we formulate the derived\nsafety conditions in the form of a second-order cone program.

In order to improve the reasoning ability of the\nmodel, previous studies pay more attention to using explicit algorithms to\nmodel the dependencies between utterances, which are deterministic, limited and\ninflexible. In addition, few studies consider differences between the options\nbefore and after reasoning. In this paper, we propose an Implicit Relational\nReasoning Graph Network to address these issues, which consists of the\nUtterance Relational Reasoner (URR) and the Option Dual Comparator (ODC).

To further improve the\nefficiency of wireless data aggregation and model learning, over-the-air\ncomputation (AirComp) is emerging as a promising solution by using the\nsuperposition characteristics of wireless channels. However, the fading and\nnoise of wireless channels can cause aggregate distortions in AirComp enabled\nfederated learning. In addition, the quality of collected data and energy\nconsumption of edge devices may also impact the accuracy and efficiency of\nmodel aggregation as well as convergence. To solve these problems, this work\nproposes a dynamic device scheduling mechanism, which can select qualified edge\ndevices to transmit their local models with a proper power control policy so as\nto participate the model training at the server in federated learning via\nAirComp. In this mechanism, the data importance is measured by the gradient of\nlocal model parameter, channel condition and energy consumption of the device\njointly. In particular, to fully use distributed datasets and accelerate the\nconvergence rate of federated learning, the local updates of unselected devices\nare also retained and accumulated for future potential transmission, instead of\nbeing discarded directly. Furthermore, the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty\noptimization problem is formulated for searching the optimal device selection\nstrategy.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-task encoder-decoder\npre-training framework (MMSpeech) for Mandarin automatic speech recognition\n(ASR), which employs both unlabeled speech and text data. The main difficulty\nin speech-text joint pre-training comes from the significant difference between\nspeech and text modalities, especially for Mandarin speech and text. Unlike\nEnglish and other languages with an alphabetic writing system, Mandarin uses an\nideographic writing system where character and sound are not tightly mapped to\none another. Therefore, we propose to introduce the phoneme modality into\npre-training, which can help capture modality-invariant information between\nMandarin speech and text. Specifically, we employ a multi-task learning\nframework including five self-supervised and supervised tasks with speech and\ntext data. For end-to-end pre-training, we introduce self-supervised\nspeech-to-pseudo-codes (S2C) and phoneme-to-text (P2T) tasks utilizing\nunlabeled speech and text data, where speech-pseudo-codes pairs and\nphoneme-text pairs are a supplement to the supervised speech-text pairs. To\ntrain the encoder to learn better speech representation, we introduce\nself-supervised masked speech prediction (MSP) and supervised phoneme\nprediction (PP) tasks to learn to map speech into phonemes. Besides, we\ndirectly add the downstream supervised speech-to-text (S2T) task into the\npre-training process, which can further improve the pre-training performance\nand achieve better recognition results even without fine-tuning. Experiments on\nAISHELL-1 show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nwith a more than 40% relative improvement compared with other pre-training\nmethods.",

Crowd-level abnormal\nbehaviors (CABs), e.g., counter flow and crowd turbulence, are proven to be the\ncrucial causes of many crowd disasters. In the recent decade, video anomaly\ndetection (VAD) techniques have achieved remarkable success in detecting\nindividual-level abnormal behaviors (e.g., sudden running, fighting and\nstealing), but research on VAD for CABs is rather limited. Unlike\nindividual-level anomaly, CABs usually do not exhibit salient difference from\nthe normal behaviors when observed locally, and the scale of CABs could vary\nfrom one scenario to another. In this paper, we present a systematic study to\ntackle the important problem of VAD for CABs with a novel crowd motion learning\nframework, multi-scale motion consistency network (MSMC-Net). MSMC-Net first\ncaptures the spatial and temporal crowd motion consistency information in a\ngraph representation. Then, it simultaneously trains multiple feature graphs\nconstructed at different scales to capture rich crowd patterns. An attention\nnetwork is used to adaptively fuse the multi-scale features for better CAB\ndetection. For the empirical study, we consider three large-scale crowd event\ndatasets, UMN, Hajj and Love Parade.

The research\ncontributions to these two techniques have most often been focused on either\none of them separately. However, focusing on the similarities of these two\ntechniques may enable a more fruitful combined family of research on software\nconfiguration, a term we use to encompass both techniques. Also, a common\nterminology may have enabled meta-analysis, a more practical application of the\nresearch on the two techniques, and prevented duplication of research effort.\nThe goal of this research study is to aid researchers in conducting a family of\nresearch on software configuration by extending an existing model of software\nconfiguration that provides terminology for research studies. To achieve our\ngoal, we started with Seigmund et al. Model of Software Configuration (MSC)\nwhich was developed based on interviews and publications on configuration\noptions. We explicitly extend the MSC to include feature toggles and to add\nqualitative analysis of feature toggle-related resources. From our analysis, we\nproposed MSCv2 as an extended version of MSC and evaluated it through its\napplication on five academic publications and the Chrome system. Our results\nindicate that multiple researchers studying the same system may provide\ndifferent definitions of software configuration in their publications. Also,\nsimilar research questions may be answered on feature toggles and configuration\noptions repeatedly because of a lack of a clear definition of software\nconfiguration. These observations indicate that having a model for defining\nsoftware configuration may enable more clear and generalized research on the\nsoftware configuration family of research.

    "abstract": "In cooperative Multi-Agent Planning (MAP), a set of goals has to be achieved\nby a set of agents. Independently of whether they perform a pre-assignment of\ngoals to agents or they directly search for a solution without any goal\nassignment, most previous works did not focus on a fair\ndistribution/achievement of goals by agents. This paper adapts well-known\nfairness schemes to MAP, and introduces two novel approaches to generate\ncost-aware fair plans. The first one solves an optimization problem to\npre-assign goals to agents, and then solves a centralized MAP task using that\nassignment. The second one consists of a planning-based compilation that allows\nsolving the joint problem of goal assignment and planning while taking into\naccount the given fairness scheme. Empirical results in several standard MAP\nbenchmarks show that these approaches outperform different baselines. They also\nshow that there is no need to sacrifice much plan cost to generate fair plans.",

    "abstract": "Safety performance evaluation is critical for developing and deploying\nconnected and automated vehicles (CAVs). One prevailing way is to design\ntesting scenarios using prior knowledge of CAVs, test CAVs in these scenarios,\nand then evaluate their safety performances. However, significant differences\nbetween CAVs and prior knowledge could severely reduce the evaluation\nefficiency. Towards addressing this issue, most existing studies focus on the\nadaptive design of testing scenarios during the CAV testing process, but so far\nthey cannot be applied to high-dimensional scenarios. In this paper, we focus\non the adaptive safety performance evaluation by leveraging the testing\nresults, after the CAV testing process. It can significantly improve the\nevaluation efficiency and be applied to high-dimensional scenarios.\nSpecifically, instead of directly evaluating the unknown quantity (e.g., crash\nrates) of CAV safety performances, we evaluate the differences between the\nunknown quantity and known quantity (i.e., control variates). By leveraging the\ntesting results, the control variates could be well designed and optimized such\nthat the differences are close to zero, so the evaluation variance could be\ndramatically reduced for different CAVs. To handle the high-dimensional\nscenarios, we propose the sparse control variates method, where the control\nvariates are designed only for the sparse and critical variables of scenarios.\nAccording to the number of critical variables in each scenario, the control\nvariates are stratified into strata and optimized within each stratum using\nmultiple linear regression techniques. We justify the proposed method's\neffectiveness by rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical study of\nhigh-dimensional overtaking scenarios.",

The\nfeature alignment constraint forces the representations of features from the\nsame field to be close, and the field uniformity constraint forces the\nrepresentations of features from different fields to be distant.

    "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is a vital task in graph-based machine learning\nand has been widely applied in many real-world applications. The primary goal\nof GAD is to capture anomalous nodes from graph datasets, which evidently\ndeviate from the majority of nodes. Recent methods have paid attention to\nvarious scales of contrastive strategies for GAD, i.e., node-subgraph and\nnode-node contrasts. However, they neglect the subgraph-subgraph comparison\ninformation which the normal and abnormal subgraph pairs behave differently in\nterms of embeddings and structures in GAD, resulting in sub-optimal task\nperformance. In this paper, we fulfill the above idea in the proposed\nmulti-view multi-scale contrastive learning framework with subgraph-subgraph\ncontrast for the first practice. To be specific, we regard the original input\ngraph as the first view and generate the second view by graph augmentation with\nedge modifications. With the guidance of maximizing the similarity of the\nsubgraph pairs, the proposed subgraph-subgraph contrast contributes to more\nrobust subgraph embeddings despite of the structure variation. Moreover, the\nintroduced subgraph-subgraph contrast cooperates well with the widely-adopted\nnode-subgraph and node-node contrastive counterparts for mutual GAD performance\npromotions. Besides, we also conduct sufficient experiments to investigate the\nimpact of different graph augmentation approaches on detection performance.

    "title": "Deep Kernel Learning for Mortality Prediction in the Face of Temporal  Shift",
    "abstract": "Neural models, with their ability to provide novel representations, have\nshown promising results in prediction tasks in healthcare. However, patient\ndemographics, medical technology, and quality of care change over time. This\noften leads to drop in the performance of neural models for prospective\npatients, especially in terms of their calibration. The deep kernel learning\n(DKL) framework may be robust to such changes as it combines neural models with\nGaussian processes, which are aware of prediction uncertainty. Our hypothesis\nis that out-of-distribution test points will result in probabilities closer to\nthe global mean and hence prevent overconfident predictions. This in turn, we\nhypothesise, will result in better calibration on prospective data.\nThis paper investigates DKL's behaviour when facing a temporal shift, which\nwas naturally introduced when an information system that feeds a cohort\ndatabase was changed. We compare DKL's performance to that of a neural baseline\nbased on recurrent neural networks. We show that DKL indeed produced superior\ncalibrated predictions. We also confirm that the DKL's predictions were indeed\nless sharp. In addition, DKL's discrimination ability was even improved: its\nAUC was 0.746 (+- 0.014 std), compared to 0.739 (+- 0.028 std) for the\nbaseline. The paper demonstrated the importance of including uncertainty in\nneural computing, especially for their prospective use.",

    "title": "Leveraging Single-View Images for Unsupervised 3D Point Cloud Completion",
    "abstract": "Point clouds captured by scanning devices are often incomplete due to\nocclusion. Point cloud completion aims to predict the complete shape based on\nits partial input. Existing methods can be classified into supervised and\nunsupervised methods. However, both of them require a large number of 3D\ncomplete point clouds, which are difficult to capture. In this paper, we\npropose Cross-PCC, an unsupervised point cloud completion method without\nrequiring any 3D complete point clouds. We only utilize 2D images of the\ncomplete objects, which are easier to capture than 3D complete and clean point\nclouds. Specifically, to take advantage of the complementary information from\n2D images, we use a single-view RGB image to extract 2D features and design a\nfusion module to fuse the 2D and 3D features extracted from the partial point\ncloud. To guide the shape of predicted point clouds, we project the predicted\npoints of the object to the 2D plane and use the foreground pixels of its\nsilhouette maps to constrain the position of the projected points. To reduce\nthe outliers of the predicted point clouds, we propose a view calibrator to\nmove the points projected to the background into the foreground by the\nsingle-view silhouette image. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the\nfirst point cloud completion method that does not require any 3D supervision.\nThe experimental results of our method are superior to those of the\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin. Moreover, compared to\nsome supervised methods, our method achieves similar performance. We will make\nthe source code publicly available at https://github.com/ltwu6/cross-pcc.",

    "abstract": "We present a lightweight post-processing method to refine the semantic\nsegmentation results of point cloud sequences. Most existing methods usually\nsegment frame by frame and encounter the inherent ambiguity of the problem:\nbased on a measurement in a single frame, labels are sometimes difficult to\npredict even for humans. To remedy this problem, we propose to explicitly train\na network to refine these results predicted by an existing segmentation method.\nThe network, which we call the P2Net, learns the consistency constraints\nbetween coincident points from consecutive frames after registration. We\nevaluate the proposed post-processing method both qualitatively and\nquantitatively on the SemanticKITTI dataset that consists of real outdoor\nscenes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by comparing the\nresults predicted by two representative networks with and without the\nrefinement by the post-processing network. Specifically, qualitative\nvisualization validates the key idea that labels of the points that are\ndifficult to predict can be corrected with P2Net. Quantitatively, overall mIoU\nis improved from 10.5% to 11.7% for PointNet [1] and from 10.8% to 15.9% for\nPointNet++ [2].",

    "abstract": "There are existing standard solvers for tackling discrete optimization\nproblems. However, in practice, it is uncommon to apply them directly to the\nlarge input space typical of this class of problems. Rather, the input is\npreprocessed to look for simplifications and to extract the core subset of the\nproblem space, which is called the Kernel. This pre-processing procedure is\nknown in the context of parameterized complexity theory as Kernelization.\nIn this thesis, I implement parallel versions of some Kernelization\nalgorithms and evaluate their performance. The performance of Kernelization\nalgorithms is measured either by the size of the output Kernel or by the time\nit takes to compute the kernel. Sometimes the Kernel is the same as the\noriginal input, so it is desirable to know this, as soon as possible. The\nproblem scope is limited to a particular type of discrete optimisation problem\nwhich is a version of the K-clique problem in which nodes of the given graph\nare pre-coloured legally using k colours.\nThe final evaluation shows that my parallel implementations achieve over 50%\nimprovement in efficiency for at least one of these algorithms.

    "abstract": "Path planning in the multi-robot system refers to calculating a set of\nactions for each robot, which will move each robot to its goal without\nconflicting with other robots. Lately, the research topic has received\nsignificant attention for its extensive applications, such as airport ground,\ndrone swarms, and automatic warehouses. Despite these available research\nresults, most of the existing investigations are concerned with the cases of\nrobots with a fixed movement speed without considering uncertainty. Therefore,\nin this work, we study the problem of path-planning in the multi-robot\nautomatic warehouse context, which considers the time-varying and uncertain\nrobots' movement speed. Specifically, the path-planning module searches a path\nwith as few conflicts as possible for a single agent by calculating traffic\ncost based on customarily distributed conflict probability and combining it\nwith the classic A* algorithm. However, this probability-based method cannot\neliminate all conflicts, and speed's uncertainty will constantly cause new\nconflicts. As a supplement, we propose the other two modules. The conflict\ndetection and re-planning module chooses objects requiring re-planning paths\nfrom the agents involved in different types of conflicts periodically by our\ndesigned rules. Also, at each step, the scheduling module fills up the agent's\npreserved queue and decides who has a higher priority when the same element is\nassigned to two agents simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Pretrained language models that have been trained to predict the next word\nover billions of text documents have been shown to also significantly predict\nbrain recordings of people comprehending language. Understanding the reasons\nbehind the observed similarities between language in machines and language in\nthe brain can lead to more insight into both systems. Recent works suggest that\nthe prediction of the next word is a key mechanism that contributes to the\nalignment between the two. What is not yet understood is whether prediction of\nthe next word is necessary for this observed alignment or simply sufficient,\nand whether there are other shared mechanisms or information that is similarly\nimportant. In this work, we take a first step towards a better understanding\nvia two simple perturbations in a popular pretrained language model. The first\nperturbation is to improve the model's ability to predict the next word in the\nspecific naturalistic stimulus text that the brain recordings correspond to. We\nshow that this indeed improves the alignment with the brain recordings.\nHowever, this improved alignment may also be due to any improved word-level or\nmulti-word level semantics for the specific world that is described by the\nstimulus narrative. We aim to disentangle the contribution of next word\nprediction and semantic knowledge via our second perturbation: scrambling the\nword order at inference time, which reduces the ability to predict the next\nword, but maintains any newly learned word-level semantics. By comparing the\nalignment with brain recordings of these differently perturbed models, we show\nthat improvements in alignment with brain recordings are due to more than\nimprovements in next word prediction and word-level semantics.",

We seek insight regarding this question by examining a dynamic\nspectrum access scenario, in which the radar wishes to transmit in the widest\nunoccupied bandwidth during each pulse repetition interval. Online learning is\ncompared to a fixed rule-based sense-and-avoid strategy. We show that given a\nsimple Markov channel model, the problem can be examined analytically for\nsimple cases via stochastic dominance. Additionally, we show that for more\nrealistic channel assumptions, learning-based approaches demonstrate greater\nability to generalize. However, for short time-horizon problems that are\nwell-specified, we find that machine learning approaches may perform poorly due\nto the inherent limitation of convergence time. We draw conclusions as to when\nlearning-based approaches are expected to be beneficial and provide guidelines\nfor future study.",

    "abstract": "Control barrier functions are a popular method of ensuring system safety, and\nthese functions can be used to enforce invariance of a set under the dynamics\nof a system. A control barrier function must have certain properties, and one\nmust both formulate a candidate control barrier function and verify that it\ndoes indeed satisfy the required properties. Targeting the latter problem, this\npaper presents a method of verifying any finite number of candidate control\nbarrier functions with linear programming. We first apply techniques from real\nalgebraic geometry to formulate verification problem statements that are\nsolvable numerically. Typically, semidefinite programming is used to verify\ncandidate control barrier functions, but this does not always scale well.\nTherefore, we next apply a method of inner-approximating the set of sums of\nsquares polynomials that significantly reduces the computational complexity of\nthese verification problems by transcribing them to linear programs. We give\nexplicit forms for the resulting linear programs, and simulation results for a\nsatellite inspection problem show that the computation time needed for\nverification can be reduced by more than 95%.",

When the ground-truth\nMDP is weakly communicating, we prove an upper bound of $\\widetilde O(H\n\\varepsilon^{-3} \\ln \\frac{1}{\\delta})$ samples per state-action pair, where $H\n:= sp(h^*)$ is the span of bias of any optimal policy, $\\varepsilon$ is the\naccuracy and $\\delta$ is the failure probability.

The core of our\nanalysis is a proper reduction bound from AMDP problems to discounted MDP\n(DMDP) problems, which may be of independent interests since it allows the\napplication of DMDP algorithms for AMDP in other settings.

In order to calibrate trust, it is\nimportant to measure drivers' trust in real time. One possible method is\nthrough modeling its dynamic changes using machine learning models and\nphysiological measures. In this paper, we proposed a technique based on machine\nlearning models to predict drivers' dynamic trust in conditional AVs using\nphysiological measurements in real time. We conducted the study in a driving\nsimulator where participants were requested to take over control from automated\ndriving in three conditions that included a control condition, a false alarm\ncondition, a miss condition with eight takeover requests (TORs) in different\nscenarios. Drivers' physiological measures were recorded during the experiment,\nincluding galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR) indices, and\neye-tracking metrics. Using five machine learning models, we found that eXtreme\nGradient Boosting (XGBoost) performed the best and was able to predict drivers'\ntrust in real time with an f1-score of 89.1%. Our findings provide good\nimplications on how to design an in-vehicle trust monitoring system to\ncalibrate drivers' trust to facilitate interaction between the driver and the\nAV in real time.",

    "abstract": "Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) are showing tremendous success on realistic\nimage classification tasks. Notably, their accuracy is similar to the\nstate-of-the-art accuracy obtained by full-precision models tailored to edge\ndevices. In this regard, BNNs are very amenable to edge devices since they\nemploy 1-bit to store the inputs and weights, and thus, their storage\nrequirements are low. Also, BNNs computations are mainly done using xnor and\npop-counts operations which are implemented very efficiently using simple\nhardware structures. Nonetheless, supporting BNNs efficiently on mobile CPUs is\nfar from trivial since their benefits are hindered by frequent memory accesses\nto load weights and inputs.\nIn BNNs, a weight or an input is stored using one bit, and aiming to increase\nstorage and computation efficiency, several of them are packed together as a\nsequence of bits. In this work, we observe that the number of unique sequences\nrepresenting a set of weights is typically low. Also, we have seen that during\nthe evaluation of a BNN layer, a small group of unique sequences is employed\nmore frequently than others. Accordingly, we propose exploiting this\nobservation by using Huffman Encoding to encode the bit sequences and then\nusing an indirection table to decode them during the BNN evaluation. Also, we\npropose a clustering scheme to identify the most common sequences of bits and\nreplace the less common ones with some similar common sequences. Hence, we\ndecrease the storage requirements and memory accesses since common sequences\nare encoded with fewer bits.\nWe extend a mobile CPU by adding a small hardware structure that can\nefficiently cache and decode the compressed sequence of bits. We evaluate our\nscheme using the ReAacNet model with the Imagenet dataset. Our experimental\nresults show that our technique can reduce memory requirement by 1.32x and\nimprove performance by 1.35x.",

The first stage, state compression, learns a\nlow-dimensional latent space of 3D hair states containing motion and\nappearance, via a novel autoencoder-as-a-tracker strategy.

To enforce higher stability\nwhile driving our dynamics model, we employ the 3D point-cloud autoencoder from\nthe compression stage for de-noising of the hair state.

Although multi-view camera systems can be\ndeployed at low cost, the lack of depth information makes current approaches\nadopt large models for good performance. Therefore, it is essential to improve\nthe efficiency of BEV 3D object detection. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one\nof the most practical techniques to train efficient yet accurate models.\nHowever, BEV KD is still under-explored to the best of our knowledge. Different\nfrom image classification tasks, BEV 3D object detection approaches are more\ncomplicated and consist of several components. In this paper, we propose a\nunified framework named BEV-LGKD to transfer the knowledge in the\nteacher-student manner. However, directly applying the teacher-student paradigm\nto BEV features fails to achieve satisfying results due to heavy background\ninformation in RGB cameras. To solve this problem, we propose to leverage the\nlocalization advantage of LiDAR points. Specifically, we transform the LiDAR\npoints to BEV space and generate the foreground mask and view-dependent mask\nfor the teacher-student paradigm. It is to be noted that our method only uses\nLiDAR points to guide the KD between RGB models. As the quality of depth\nestimation is crucial for BEV perception, we further introduce depth\ndistillation to our framework. Our unified framework is simple yet effective\nand achieves a significant performance boost. Code will be released.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have succeeded in several challenging\ndomains. Classic Online RL job schedulers can learn efficient scheduling\nstrategies but often takes thousands of timesteps to explore the environment\nand adapt from a randomly initialized DNN policy. Existing RL schedulers\noverlook the importance of learning from historical data and improving upon\ncustom heuristic policies. Offline reinforcement learning presents the prospect\nof policy optimization from pre-recorded datasets without online environment\ninteraction. Following the recent success of data-driven learning, we explore\ntwo RL methods: 1) Behaviour Cloning and 2) Offline RL, which aim to learn\npolicies from logged data without interacting with the environment. These\nmethods address the challenges concerning the cost of data collection and\nsafety, particularly pertinent to real-world applications of RL. Although the\ndata-driven RL methods generate good results, we show that the performance is\nhighly dependent on the quality of the historical datasets. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that by effectively incorporating prior expert demonstrations to\npre-train the agent, we short-circuit the random exploration phase to learn a\nreasonable policy with online training. We utilize Offline RL as a\n\\textbf{launchpad} to learn effective scheduling policies from prior experience\ncollected using Oracle or heuristic policies. Such a framework is effective for\npre-training from historical datasets and well suited to continuous improvement\nwith online data collection.",

    "abstract": "Kernel matrices, as well as weighted graphs represented by them, are\nubiquitous objects in machine learning, statistics and other related fields.\nThe main drawback of using kernel methods (learning and inference using kernel\nmatrices) is efficiency -- given $n$ input points, most kernel-based algorithms\nneed to materialize the full $n \\times n$ kernel matrix before performing any\nsubsequent computation, thus incurring $\\Omega(n^2)$ runtime. Breaking this\nquadratic barrier for various problems has therefore, been a subject of\nextensive research efforts.\nWe break the quadratic barrier and obtain $\\textit{subquadratic}$ time\nalgorithms for several fundamental linear-algebraic and graph processing\nprimitives, including approximating the top eigenvalue and eigenvector,\nspectral sparsification, solving linear systems, local clustering, low-rank\napproximation, arboricity estimation and counting weighted triangles. We build\non the recent Kernel Density Estimation framework, which (after preprocessing\nin time subquadratic in $n$) can return estimates of row/column sums of the\nkernel matrix. In particular, we develop efficient reductions from\n$\\textit{weighted vertex}$ and $\\textit{weighted edge sampling}$ on kernel\ngraphs, $\\textit{simulating random walks}$ on kernel graphs, and\n$\\textit{importance sampling}$ on matrices to Kernel Density Estimation and\nshow that we can generate samples from these distributions in\n$\\textit{sublinear}$ (in the support of the distribution) time. Our reductions\nare the central ingredient in each of our applications and we believe they may\nbe of independent interest. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our\nalgorithms on low-rank approximation (LRA) and spectral sparsification, where\nwe observe a $\\textbf{9x}$ decrease in the number of kernel evaluations over\nbaselines for LRA and a $\\textbf{41x}$ reduction in the graph size for spectral\nsparsification.",

    "abstract": "Although self-/un-supervised methods have led to rapid progress in visual\nrepresentation learning, these methods generally treat objects and scenes using\nthe same lens. In this paper, we focus on learning representations for objects\nand scenes that preserve the structure among them.\nMotivated by the observation that visually similar objects are close in the\nrepresentation space, we argue that the scenes and objects should instead\nfollow a hierarchical structure based on their compositionality. To exploit\nsuch a structure, we propose a contrastive learning framework where a Euclidean\nloss is used to learn object representations and a hyperbolic loss is used to\nencourage representations of scenes to lie close to representations of their\nconstituent objects in a hyperbolic space. This novel hyperbolic objective\nencourages the scene-object hypernymy among the representations by optimizing\nthe magnitude of their norms. We show that when pretraining on the COCO and\nOpenImages datasets, the hyperbolic loss improves downstream performance of\nseveral baselines across multiple datasets and tasks, including image\nclassification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. We also show that\nthe properties of the learned representations allow us to solve various vision\ntasks that involve the interaction between scenes and objects in a zero-shot\nfashion.

    "abstract": "The sheer volume of online user-generated content has rendered content\nmoderation technologies essential in order to protect digital platform\naudiences from content that may cause anxiety, worry, or concern. Despite the\nefforts towards developing automated solutions to tackle this problem, creating\naccurate models remains challenging due to the lack of adequate task-specific\ntraining data. The fact that manually annotating such data is a highly\ndemanding procedure that could severely affect the annotators' emotional\nwell-being is directly related to the latter limitation. In this paper, we\npropose the CM-Refinery framework that leverages large-scale multimedia\ndatasets to automatically extend initial training datasets with hard examples\nthat can refine content moderation models, while significantly reducing the\ninvolvement of human annotators. We apply our method on two model adaptation\nstrategies designed with respect to the different challenges observed while\ncollecting data, i.e. lack of (i) task-specific negative data or (ii) both\npositive and negative data. Additionally, we introduce a diversity criterion\napplied to the data collection process that further enhances the generalization\nperformance of the refined models. The proposed method is evaluated on the Not\nSafe for Work (NSFW) and disturbing content detection tasks on benchmark\ndatasets achieving 1.32% and 1.94% accuracy improvements compared to the state\nof the art, respectively.

    "abstract": "The performance of individual evolutionary optimization algorithms is mostly\nmeasured in terms of statistics such as mean, median and standard deviation\netc., computed over the best solutions obtained with few trails of the\nalgorithm. To compare the performance of two algorithms, the values of these\nstatistics are compared instead of comparing the solutions directly. This kind\nof comparison lacks direct comparison of solutions obtained with different\nalgorithms. For instance, the comparison of best solutions (or worst solution)\nof two algorithms simply not possible. Moreover, ranking of algorithms is\nmostly done in terms of solution quality only, despite the fact that the\nconvergence of algorithm is also an important factor. In this paper, a direct\ncomparison approach is proposed to analyze the performance of evolutionary\noptimization algorithms. A direct comparison matrix called \\emph{Prasatul\nMatrix} is prepared, which accounts direct comparison outcome of best solutions\nobtained with two algorithms for a specific number of trials. Five different\nperformance measures are designed based on the prasatul matrix to evaluate the\nperformance of algorithms in terms of Optimality and Comparability of\nsolutions. These scores are utilized to develop a score-driven approach for\ncomparing performance of multiple algorithms as well as for ranking both in the\ngrounds of solution quality and convergence analysis.

In this paper, we propose a method for\nsynthesizing controllers for Markov jump linear systems (MJLSs), a particular\nclass of cyber-physical systems, that certifiably satisfy a requirement\nexpressed as a specification in probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL). An\nMJLS consists of a finite set of linear dynamics with unknown additive\ndisturbances, where jumps between these modes are governed by a Markov decision\nprocess (MDP). We consider both the case where the transition function of this\nMDP is given by probability intervals or where it is completely unknown. Our\napproach is based on generating a finite-state abstraction which captures both\nthe discrete and the continuous behaviour of the original system. We formalise\nsuch abstraction as an interval Markov decision process (iMDP): intervals of\ntransition probabilities are computed using sampling techniques from the\nso-called \"scenario approach\", resulting in a probabilistically sound\napproximation of the MJLS. This iMDP abstracts both the jump dynamics between\nmodes, as well as the continuous dynamics within the modes.

Terrain-Aware Locomotion\n(TAL) implies that the robot can perceive the terrain with its sensors, and can\ntake decisions based on this information. This thesis presents TAL strategies\nboth from a proprioceptive and an exteroceptive perspective. The strategies are\nimplemented at the level of locomotion planning, control, and state estimation,\nand using optimization and learning techniques. The first part is on TAL\nstrategies at the Whole-Body Control (WBC) level. We introduce a passive WBC\n(pWBC) framework that allows the robot to stabilize and walk over challenging\nterrain while taking into account the terrain geometry (inclination) and\nfriction properties. The pWBC relies on rigid contact assumptions which makes\nit suitable only for stiff terrain. As a consequence, we introduce Soft Terrain\nAdaptation aNd Compliance Estimation (STANCE) which is a soft terrain\nadaptation algorithm that generalizes beyond rigid terrain. The second part of\nthe thesis focuses on vision-based TAL strategies. We present Vision-Based\nTerrain-Aware Locomotion (ViTAL) which is an online planning strategy that\nselects the footholds based on the robot capabilities, and the robot pose that\nmaximizes the chances of the robot succeeding in reaching these footholds.\nViTAL relies on a set of robot skills that characterizes the capabilities of\nthe robot and its legs. The skills include the robot's ability to assess the\nterrain's geometry, avoid leg collisions, and avoid reaching kinematic limits.\nOur strategies are based on optimization and learning methods and are validated\non HyQ and HyQReal in simulation and experiment.

This shows that the computational\ncomplexity of the solution operator is intrinsically high, independent of the\nnumerical algorithm that is used to obtain a solution. This indicates that\nthere is a fundamental problem in computing a solution on a digital hardware.",

    "abstract": "In modern business processes, the amount of data collected has increased\nsubstantially in recent years. Because this data can potentially yield valuable\ninsights, automated knowledge extraction based on process mining has been\nproposed, among other techniques, to provide users with intuitive access to the\ninformation contained therein. At present, the majority of technologies aim to\nreconstruct explicit business process models. These are directly interpretable\nbut limited concerning the integration of diverse and real-valued information\nsources. On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) benefits from the vast amount\nof data available and can deal with high-dimensional sources, yet it has rarely\nbeen applied to being used in processes. In this contribution, we evaluate the\ncapability of modern Transformer architectures as well as more classical ML\ntechnologies of modeling process regularities, as can be quantitatively\nevaluated by their prediction capability. In addition, we demonstrate the\ncapability of attentional properties and feature relevance determination by\nhighlighting features that are crucial to the processes' predictive abilities.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using five benchmark datasets and\nshow that the ML models are capable of predicting critical outcomes and that\nthe attention mechanisms or XAI components offer new insights into the\nunderlying processes.",

In\nthis paper, we give a general approach for solving clustering with outliers,\nwhich results in a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm in $k$ and $m$,\nthat almost matches the approximation ratio for its outlier-free counterpart.\nAs a corollary, we obtain FPT approximation algorithms with optimal\napproximation ratios for $k$-Median and $k$-Means with outliers in general\nmetrics.

We thus study the regime in which\nplayers have only a small constant number of strategies and obtain the\nfollowing.

Researchers have proposed many\napproaches to mitigate the impact of the label shift, e.g., balancing the\ntraining data. However, these methods often consider the underparametrized\nregime, where the sample size is much larger than the data dimension. The\nresearch under the overparametrized regime is very limited. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose a new asymptotic analysis of the Fisher Linear Discriminant\nclassifier for binary classification with label shift. Specifically, we prove\nthat there exists a phase transition phenomenon: Under certain overparametrized\nregime, the classifier trained using imbalanced data outperforms the\ncounterpart with reduced balanced data.

    "abstract": "Memes are powerful means for effective communication on social media.

Previous research on memes has\nprimarily focused on characterizing their affective spectrum and detecting\nwhether the meme's message insinuates any intended harm, such as hate, offense,\nracism, etc. However, memes often use abstraction, which can be elusive. Here,\nwe introduce a novel task - EXCLAIM, generating explanations for visual\nsemantic role labeling in memes. To this end, we curate ExHVV, a novel dataset\nthat offers natural language explanations of connotative roles for three types\nof entities - heroes, villains, and victims, encompassing 4,680 entities\npresent in 3K memes. We also benchmark ExHVV with several strong unimodal and\nmultimodal baselines. Moreover, we posit LUMEN, a novel multimodal, multi-task\nlearning framework that endeavors to address EXCLAIM optimally by jointly\nlearning to predict the correct semantic roles and correspondingly to generate\nsuitable natural language explanations. LUMEN distinctly outperforms the best\nbaseline across 18 standard natural language generation evaluation metrics.

    "title": "New Probabilistic-Dynamic Multi-Method Ensembles for Optimization based  on the CRO-SL",
    "abstract": "In this paper we propose new probabilistic and dynamic (adaptive) strategies\nto create multi-method ensembles based on the Coral Reefs Optimization with\nSubstrate Layers (CRO-SL) algorithm. The CRO-SL is an evolutionary-based\nensemble approach, able to combine different search procedures within a single\npopulation. In this work we discuss two different probabilistic strategies to\nimprove the algorithm. First, we defined the Probabilistic CRO-SL (PCRO-SL),\nwhich substitutes the substrates in the CRO-SL population by {\\em tags}\nassociated with each individual. Each tag represents a different operator which\nwill modify the individual in the reproduction phase. In each generation of the\nalgorithm, the tags are randomly assigned to the individuals with a similar\nprobability, obtaining this way an ensemble with a more intense change in the\napplication of different operators to a given individual than the original\nCRO-SL. The second strategy discussed in this paper is the Dynamical\nProbabilistic CRO-SL (DPCRO-SL), in which the probability of tag assignment is\nmodified during the evolution of the algorithm, depending on the quality of the\nsolutions generated in each substrate. Thus, the best substrates in the search\nprocess will be assigned with a higher probability that those which showed a\nworse performance during the search. We test the performance of the proposed\nprobabilistic and dynamic ensembles in different optimization problems,\nincluding benchmark functions and a real application of wind turbines layout\noptimization, comparing the results obtained with that of existing algorithms\nin the literature.",

    "abstract": "We consider the nonlinear inverse problem of learning a transition operator\n$\\mathbf{A}$ from partial observations at different times, in particular from\nsparse observations of entries of its powers\n$\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{A}^2,\\cdots,\\mathbf{A}^{T}$. This Spatio-Temporal\nTransition Operator Recovery problem is motivated by the recent interest in\nlearning time-varying graph signals that are driven by graph operators\ndepending on the underlying graph topology. We address the nonlinearity of the\nproblem by embedding it into a higher-dimensional space of suitable\nblock-Hankel matrices, where it becomes a low-rank matrix completion problem,\neven if $\\mathbf{A}$ is of full rank. For both a uniform and an adaptive random\nspace-time sampling model, we quantify the recoverability of the transition\noperator via suitable measures of incoherence of these block-Hankel embedding\nmatrices. For graph transition operators these measures of incoherence depend\non the interplay between the dynamics and the graph topology. We develop a\nsuitable non-convex iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm,\nestablish its quadratic local convergence, and show that, in optimal scenarios,\nno more than $\\mathcal{O}(rn \\log(nT))$ space-time samples are sufficient to\nensure accurate recovery of a rank-$r$ operator $\\mathbf{A}$ of size $n \\times\nn$. This establishes that spatial samples can be substituted by a comparable\nnumber of space-time samples. We provide an efficient implementation of the\nproposed IRLS algorithm with space complexity of order $O(r n T)$ and\nper-iteration time complexity linear in $n$. Numerical experiments for\ntransition operators based on several graph models confirm that the theoretical\nfindings accurately track empirical phase transitions, and illustrate the\napplicability and scalability of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Consider a scenario in one-shot query-guided object localization where\nneither an image of the object nor the object category name is available as a\nquery. In such a scenario, a hand-drawn sketch of the object could be a choice\nfor a query. However, hand-drawn crude sketches alone, when used as queries,\nmight be ambiguous for object localization, e.g., a sketch of a laptop could be\nconfused for a sofa. On the other hand, a linguistic definition of the\ncategory, e.g., a small portable computer small enough to use in your lap\"\nalong with the sketch query, gives better visual and semantic cues for object\nlocalization. In this work, we present a multimodal query-guided object\nlocalization approach under the challenging open-set setting. In particular, we\nuse queries from two modalities, namely, hand-drawn sketch and description of\nthe object (also known as gloss), to perform object localization. Multimodal\nquery-guided object localization is a challenging task, especially when a large\ndomain gap exists between the queries and the natural images, as well as due to\nthe challenge of combining the complementary and minimal information present\nacross the queries. For example, hand-drawn crude sketches contain abstract\nshape information of an object, while the text descriptions often capture\npartial semantic information about a given object category. To address the\naforementioned challenges, we present a novel cross-modal attention scheme that\nguides the region proposal network to generate object proposals relevant to the\ninput queries and a novel orthogonal projection-based proposal scoring\ntechnique that scores each proposal with respect to the queries, thereby\nyielding the final localization results. ...",

    "abstract": "Upon replay, JavaScript on archived web pages can generate recurring HTTP\nrequests that lead to unnecessary traffic to the web archive. In one example,\nan archived page averaged more than 1000 requests per minute. These requests\nare not visible to the user, so if a user leaves such an archived page open in\na browser tab, they would be unaware that their browser is continuing to\ngenerate traffic to the web archive. We found that web pages that require\nregular updates (e.g., radio playlists, updates for sports scores, image\ncarousels) are more likely to make such recurring requests. If the resources\nrequested by the web page are not archived, some web archives may attempt to\npatch the archive by requesting the resources from the live web. If the\nrequested resources are unavailable on the live web, the resources cannot be\narchived, and the responses remain HTTP 404. Some archived pages continue to\npoll the server as frequently as they did on the live web, while some pages\npoll the server even more frequently if their requests return HTTP 404\nresponses, creating a high amount of unnecessary traffic. On a large scale,\nsuch web pages are effectively a denial of service attack on the web archive.\nSignificant computational, network and storage resources are required for web\narchives to archive and then successfully replay pages as they were on the live\nweb, and these resources should not be spent on unnecessary HTTP traffic. Our\nproposed solution is to optimize archival replay using Cache-Control HTTP\nresponse headers.

    "abstract": "Sequence models based on linear state spaces (SSMs) have recently emerged as\na promising choice of architecture for modeling long range dependencies across\nvarious modalities. However, they invariably rely on discretization of a\ncontinuous state space, which complicates their presentation and understanding.\nIn this work, we dispose of the discretization step, and propose a model based\non vanilla Diagonal Linear RNNs ($\\mathrm{DLR}$). We empirically show that\n$\\mathrm{DLR}$ is as performant as previously-proposed SSMs in the presence of\nstrong supervision, despite being conceptually much simpler. Moreover, we\ncharacterize the expressivity of SSMs (including $\\mathrm{DLR}$) and\nattention-based models via a suite of $13$ synthetic sequence-to-sequence tasks\ninvolving interactions over tens of thousands of tokens, ranging from simple\noperations, such as shifting an input sequence, to detecting co-dependent\nvisual features over long spatial ranges in flattened images.

In\ncontrast, obtaining common-sense relationships from text, e.g., \"a table-lamp\nis a lamp that sits on top of a table\", is much easier. Additionally,\ncommon-sense relationships like \"on-top-of\" are easy to annotate in a\ntask-agnostic fashion. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model that\nuses such relational knowledge to transform an off-the-shelf detector of coarse\nobject categories (e.g., \"table\", \"lamp\") into a detector of fine-grained\ncategories (e.g., \"table-lamp\"). We demonstrate that our method, RelDetect,\nachieves performance competitive to finetuning based state-of-the-art object\ndetector baselines when an extremely low amount of fine-grained annotations is\navailable ($0.2\\%$ of entire dataset). We also demonstrate that RelDetect is\nable to utilize the inherent transferability of relationship information to\nobtain a better performance ($+5$ mAP points) than the above baselines on an\nunseen dataset (zero-shot transfer). In summary, we demonstrate the power of\nusing relationships for object detection on datasets where fine-grained object\ncategories can be linked to coarse-grained categories via suitable\nrelationships.",

Recent empirical evidence suggests that this added cost might be in vain,\nas uncertainty sampling can sometimes perform even worse than passive learning.\nWhile existing works offer different explanations in the low-dimensional\nregime, this paper shows that the underlying mechanism is entirely different in\nhigh dimensions: we prove for logistic regression that passive learning\noutperforms uncertainty sampling even for noiseless data and when using the\nuncertainty of the Bayes optimal classifier.

We introduce, ResFormer, a framework that is built upon the seminal\nidea of multi-resolution training for improved performance on a wide spectrum\nof, mostly unseen, testing resolutions. In particular, ResFormer operates on\nreplicated images of different resolutions and enforces a scale consistency\nloss to engage interactive information across different scales. More\nimportantly, to alternate among varying resolutions, we propose a global-local\npositional embedding strategy that changes smoothly conditioned on input sizes.\nThis allows ResFormer to cope with novel resolutions effectively. We conduct\nextensive experiments for image classification on ImageNet. The results provide\nstrong quantitative evidence that ResFormer has promising scaling abilities\ntowards a wide range resolutions. For instance, ResFormer-B-MR achieves a Top-1\naccuracy of 75.86% and 81.72% when evaluated on relatively low and high\nresolutions respectively (i.e., 96 and 640), which are 48% and 7.49% better\nthan DeiT-B.

For real-valued features the algorithm has an\namortized running time per insertion/deletion of $O\\big(\\frac{d \\log^3\nn}{\\epsilon^2}\\big)$, which improves to $O\\big(\\frac{d \\log^2\nn}{\\epsilon}\\big)$ for binary or categorical features, while it uses space $O(n\nd)$, where $n$ is the maximum number of examples at any point in time and $d$\nis the number of features. Our algorithm is nearly optimal, as we show that any\nalgorithm with similar guarantees uses amortized running time $\\Omega(d)$ and\nspace $\\tilde{\\Omega} (n d)$.

    "abstract": "We tackle open-world semantic segmentation, which aims at learning to segment\narbitrary visual concepts in images, by using only image-text pairs without\ndense annotations. Existing open-world segmentation methods have shown\nimpressive advances by employing contrastive learning (CL) to learn diverse\nvisual concepts and adapting the learned image-level understanding to the\nsegmentation task. However, these methods based on CL have a discrepancy since\nit only considers image-text level alignment in training time, while the\nsegmentation task requires region-text level alignment at test time. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Text-grounded Contrastive Learning (TCL) framework to\ndirectly align a text and a region described by the text to address the\ntrain-test discrepancy. Our method generates a segmentation mask associated\nwith a given text, extracts grounded image embedding from the masked region,\nand aligns it with text embedding via TCL. The framework addresses the\ndiscrepancy by letting the model learn region-text level alignment instead of\nimage-text level alignment and encourages the model to directly improve the\nquality of generated segmentation masks. In addition, for a rigorous and fair\ncomparison, we present a unified evaluation protocol with widely used 8\nsemantic segmentation datasets.

In this direction,\nwe explore the tasks of 3D human semantic-, instance- and multi-human body-part\nsegmentation.

We address this challenge and propose a\nframework for synthesizing virtual humans in realistic 3D scenes. Synthetic\npoint cloud data is attractive since the domain gap between real and synthetic\ndepth is small compared to images. Our analysis of different training schemes\nusing a combination of synthetic and realistic data shows that synthetic data\nfor pre-training improves performance in a wide variety of segmentation tasks\nand models. We further propose the first end-to-end model for 3D multi-human\nbody-part segmentation, called Human3D, that performs all the above\nsegmentation tasks in a unified manner. Remarkably, Human3D even outperforms\nprevious task-specific state-of-the-art methods.

A key hurdle to accomplishing this task is the need\nfor paired data consisting of all modalities (i.e., constraints) and their\ncorresponding output.

This paper proposes a\nsolution to this problem based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models\n(DDPMs).

Since\neach sampling step in the DDPM follows a Gaussian distribution, we show that\nthere exists a closed-form solution for generating an image given various\nconstraints. Our method can unite multiple diffusion models trained on multiple\nsub-tasks and conquer the combined task through our proposed sampling strategy.\nWe also introduce a novel reliability parameter that allows using different\noff-the-shelf diffusion models trained across various datasets during sampling\ntime alone to guide it to the desired outcome satisfying multiple constraints.\nWe perform experiments on various standard multimodal tasks to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach.

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have received wide acclaim among the\nmachine learning (ML) community for their ability to generate realistic 2D\nimages. ML is being applied more often to complex problems beyond those of\ncomputer vision. However, current frameworks often serve as black boxes and\nlack physics embeddings, leading to poor ability in enforcing constraints and\nunreliable models. In this work, we develop physics embeddings that can be\nstringently imposed, referred to as hard constraints, in the neural network\narchitecture. We demonstrate their capability for 3D turbulence by embedding\nthem in GANs, particularly to enforce the mass conservation constraint in\nincompressible fluid turbulence. In doing so, we also explore and contrast the\neffects of other methods of imposing physics constraints within the GANs\nframework, especially penalty-based physics constraints popular in literature.\nBy using physics-informed diagnostics and statistics, we evaluate the strengths\nand weaknesses of our approach and demonstrate its feasibility.",

We then infer a ``media-bias\nchart'' of (bias, quality) coordinates for the media outlets by integrating the\n(bias, quality) measurements of the tweets of the media outlets. We also apply\na variety of baseline machine-learning methods, such as a naive-Bayes method\nand a support-vector machine (SVM), to infer the bias and quality values for\neach tweet.

Such a network-imposed constraint contradicts any\nsecond- or higher-order partial differential equations (PDEs). Therefore, a\nReLU-based MLP cannot form a permissible function space for the approximation\nof their solutions. Inspired by this pitfall, we prove that a linear PDE up to\nthe $n$-th order can be strictly satisfied by an MLP with $C^n$ activation\nfunctions when the weights of its output layer lie on a certain hyperplane, as\ncalled the out-layer-hyperplane. An MLP equipped with the out-layer-hyperplane\nbecomes \"physics-enforced\", no longer requiring a loss function for the PDE\nitself (but only those for the initial and boundary conditions). Such a\nhyperplane exists not only for MLPs but for any network architecture tailed by\na fully-connected hidden layer.

One core feature of NFTs is the\noption to embed creator royalties which earmark a percentage of future sale\nproceeds to creators, each time their NFTs change hands. As popular as this\nfeature is in practice, its utility is often questioned because buyers, the\nargument goes, simply ``price it in at the time of purchase''. As intuitive as\nthis argument sounds, it is incomplete. We find royalties can add value to\ncreators in at least three distinct ways. (i) Risk sharing: when creators and\nbuyers are risk sensitive, royalties can improve trade by splitting the risks\nassociated with future price volatility; (ii) Dynamic pricing: in the presence\nof information asymmetry, royalties can extract more revenues from\nbetter-informed speculators over time, mimicking the benefits of ``dynamic\npricing''; (iii) Price discrimination: when creators sell multi-unit NFT\ncollections, royalties can better capture value from heterogeneous buyers.

However, graph-based learning for\nautomated labeling of tree-like anatomical structures has received limited\nattention in the literature. The majority of prior studies have limitations in\nthe entity graph construction, are dependent on topological structures, and\nhave limited accuracy due to the anatomical variability between subjects. In\nthis paper, we propose an intuitive graph representation method, well suited to\nuse with 3D coordinate data obtained from angiography scans. We subsequently\nseek to analyze subject-specific graphs using geometric deep learning. The\nproposed models leverage expert annotated labels from 141 patients to learn\nrepresentations of each coronary segment, while capturing the effects of\nanatomical variability within the training data. We investigate different\nvariants of so-called message passing neural networks. Through extensive\nevaluations, our pipeline achieves a promising weighted F1-score of 0.805 for\nlabeling coronary artery (13 classes) for a five-fold cross-validation.\nConsidering the ability of graph models in dealing with irregular data, and\ntheir scalability for data segmentation, this work highlights the potential of\nsuch methods to provide quantitative evidence to support the decisions of\nmedical experts.",

    "abstract": "Brain network provides important insights for the diagnosis of many brain\ndisorders, and how to effectively model the brain structure has become one of\nthe core issues in the domain of brain imaging analysis. Recently, various\ncomputational methods have been proposed to estimate the causal relationship\n(i.e., effective connectivity) between brain regions. Compared with traditional\ncorrelation-based methods, effective connectivity can provide the direction of\ninformation flow, which may provide additional information for the diagnosis of\nbrain diseases. However, existing methods either ignore the fact that there is\na temporal-lag in the information transmission across brain regions, or simply\nset the temporal-lag value between all brain regions to a fixed value. To\novercome these issues, we design an effective temporal-lag neural network\n(termed ETLN) to simultaneously infer the causal relationships and the\ntemporal-lag values between brain regions, which can be trained in an\nend-to-end manner. In addition, we also introduce three mechanisms to better\nguide the modeling of brain networks. The evaluation results on the Alzheimer's\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative disorder affecting\nthe macula, a key area of the retina for visual acuity. Nowadays, it is the\nmost frequent cause of blindness in developed countries. Although some\npromising treatments have been developed, their effectiveness is low in\nadvanced stages. This emphasizes the importance of large-scale screening\nprograms. Nevertheless, implementing such programs for AMD is usually\nunfeasible, since the population at risk is large and the diagnosis is\nchallenging. All this motivates the development of automatic methods. In this\nsense, several works have achieved positive results for AMD diagnosis using\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, none incorporates explainability\nmechanisms, which limits their use in clinical practice. In that regard, we\npropose an explainable deep learning approach for the diagnosis of AMD via the\njoint identification of its associated retinal lesions. In our proposal, a CNN\nis trained end-to-end for the joint task using image-level labels. The provided\nlesion information is of clinical interest, as it allows to assess the\ndevelopmental stage of AMD. Additionally, the approach allows to explain the\ndiagnosis from the identified lesions. This is possible thanks to the use of a\nCNN with a custom setting that links the lesions and the diagnosis.\nFurthermore, the proposed setting also allows to obtain coarse lesion\nsegmentation maps in a weakly-supervised way, further improving the\nexplainability. The training data for the approach can be obtained without much\nextra work by clinicians. The experiments conducted demonstrate that our\napproach can identify AMD and its associated lesions satisfactorily, while\nproviding adequate coarse segmentation maps for most common lesions.",

    "abstract": "We consider the constrained sampling problem where the goal is to sample from\na distribution $\\pi(x)\\propto e^{-f(x)}$ and $x$ is constrained on a convex\nbody $\\mathcal{C}\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$. Motivated by penalty methods from\noptimization, we propose penalized Langevin Dynamics (PLD) and penalized\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo (PHMC) that convert the constrained sampling problem\ninto an unconstrained one by introducing a penalty function for constraint\nviolations. When $f$ is smooth and the gradient is available, we show\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d/\\varepsilon^{10})$ iteration complexity for PLD to\nsample the target up to an $\\varepsilon$-error where the error is measured in\nterms of the total variation distance and $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\cdot)$ hides\nsome logarithmic factors.

To our\nknowledge, these are the first convergence rate results for Hamiltonian Monte\nCarlo methods in the constrained sampling setting that can handle non-convex\n$f$ and can provide guarantees with the best dimension dependency among\nexisting methods with deterministic gradients. We then consider the setting\nwhere unbiased stochastic gradients are available. We propose PSGLD and PSGHMC\nthat can handle stochastic gradients without Metropolis-Hasting correction\nsteps.

But when data is multiply annotated, standard deep\nlearning models are often not applicable. In this paper, we propose a novel\nneural network framework, called Multi-Rater Prism (MrPrism) to learn the\nmedical image segmentation from multiple labels. Inspired by the iterative\nhalf-quadratic optimization, the proposed MrPrism will combine the multi-rater\nconfidences assignment task and calibrated segmentation task in a recurrent\nmanner. In this recurrent process, MrPrism can learn inter-observer variability\ntaking into account the image semantic properties, and finally converges to a\nself-calibrated segmentation result reflecting the inter-observer agreement.\nSpecifically, we propose Converging Prism (ConP) and Diverging Prism (DivP) to\nprocess the two tasks iteratively. ConP learns calibrated segmentation based on\nthe multi-rater confidence maps estimated by DivP. DivP generates multi-rater\nconfidence maps based on the segmentation masks estimated by ConP.

    "abstract": "In practice, Wearable Human Activity Recognition (WHAR) models usually face\nperformance degradation on the new user due to user variance. Unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (UDA) becomes the natural solution to cross-user WHAR under\nannotation scarcity. Existing UDA models usually align samples across domains\nwithout differentiation, which ignores the difference among samples. In this\npaper, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation model with sample weight\nlearning (SWL-Adapt) for cross-user WHAR. SWL-Adapt calculates sample weights\naccording to the classification loss and domain discrimination loss of each\nsample with a parameterized network. We introduce the meta-optimization based\nupdate rule to learn this network end-to-end, which is guided by\nmeta-classification loss on the selected pseudo-labeled target samples.\nTherefore, this network can fit a weighting function according to the\ncross-user WHAR task at hand, which is superior to existing sample\ndifferentiation rules fixed for special scenarios. Extensive experiments on\nthree public WHAR datasets demonstrate that SWL-Adapt achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance on the cross-user WHAR task, outperforming the\nbest baseline by an average of 3.1% and 5.3% in accuracy and macro F1 score,\nrespectively.",

    "title": "On the Effective Usage of Priors in RSS-based Localization",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the localization problem in dense urban settings. In\nsuch environments, Global Navigation Satellite Systems fail to provide good\naccuracy due to low likelihood of line-of-sight (LOS) links between the\nreceiver (Rx) to be located and the satellites, due to the presence of\nobstacles like the buildings. Thus, one has to resort to other technologies,\nwhich can reliably operate under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. Recently,\nwe proposed a Received Signal Strength (RSS) fingerprint and convolutional\nneural network-based algorithm, LocUNet, and demonstrated its state-of-the-art\nlocalization performance with respect to the widely adopted k-nearest neighbors\n(kNN) algorithm, and to state-of-the-art time of arrival (ToA) ranging-based\nmethods. In the current work, we first recognize LocUNet's ability to learn the\nunderlying prior distribution of the Rx position or Rx and transmitter (Tx)\nassociation preferences from the training data, and attribute its high\nperformance to these. Conversely, we demonstrate that classical methods based\non probabilistic approach, can greatly benefit from an appropriate\nincorporation of such prior information. Our studies also numerically prove\nLocUNet's close to optimal performance in many settings, by comparing it with\nthe theoretically optimal formulations.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the design of a wireless sensor network for detecting and\nalerting the freezing of gait (FoG) symptoms in patients with Parkinson's\ndisease. Three sensor nodes, each integrating a 3-axis accelerometer, can be\nplaced on a patient at ankle, thigh, and truck. Each sensor node can\nindependently detect FoG using an on-device deep learning (DL) model, featuring\na squeeze and excitation convolutional neural network (CNN). In a validation\nusing a public dataset, the prototype developed achieved a FoG detection\nsensitivity of 88.8% and an F1 score of 85.34%, using less than 20 k trainable\nparameters per sensor node. Once FoG is detected, an auditory signal will be\ngenerated to alert users, and the alarm signal will also be sent to mobile\nphones for further actions if needed. The sensor node can be easily recharged\nwirelessly by inductive coupling. The system is self-contained and processes\nall user data locally without streaming data to external devices or the cloud,\nthus eliminating the cybersecurity risks and power penalty associated with\nwireless data transmission. The developed methodology can be used in a wide\nrange of applications.",

    "abstract": "In the field of antibody engineering, an essential task is to design a novel\nantibody whose paratopes bind to a specific antigen with correct epitopes.\nUnderstanding antibody structure and its paratope can facilitate a mechanistic\nunderstanding of its function. Therefore, antibody structure prediction from\nits sequence alone has always been a highly valuable problem for de novo\nantibody design. AlphaFold2, a breakthrough in the field of structural biology,\nprovides a solution to predict protein structure based on protein sequences and\ncomputationally expensive coevolutionary multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).\nHowever, the computational efficiency and undesirable prediction accuracy of\nantibodies, especially on the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of\nantibodies limit their applications in the industrially high-throughput drug\ndesign. To learn an informative representation of antibodies, we employed a\ndeep antibody language model (ALM) on curated sequences from the observed\nantibody space database via a transformer model. We also developed a novel\nmodel named xTrimoABFold to predict antibody structure from antibody sequence\nbased on the pretrained ALM as well as efficient evoformers and structural\nmodules. The model was trained end-to-end on the antibody structures in PDB by\nminimizing the ensemble loss of domain-specific focal loss on CDR and the\nframe-aligned point loss. xTrimoABFold outperforms AlphaFold2 and other protein\nlanguage model based SOTAs, e.g., OmegaFold, HelixFold-Single, and IgFold with\na large significant margin (30+\\% improvement on RMSD) while performing 151\ntimes faster than AlphaFold2. To the best of our knowledge, xTrimoABFold\nachieved state-of-the-art antibody structure prediction. Its improvement in\nboth accuracy and efficiency makes it a valuable tool for de novo antibody\ndesign and could make further improvements in immuno-theory.",

    "abstract": "Quantum machine learning has become an area of growing interest but has\ncertain theoretical and hardware-specific limitations. Notably, the problem of\nvanishing gradients, or barren plateaus, renders the training impossible for\ncircuits with high qubit counts, imposing a limit on the number of qubits that\ndata scientists can use for solving problems. Independently, angle-embedded\nsupervised quantum neural networks were shown to produce truncated Fourier\nseries with a degree directly dependent on two factors: the depth of the\nencoding, and the number of parallel qubits the encoding is applied to. The\ndegree of the Fourier series limits the model expressivity. This work\nintroduces two new architectures whose Fourier degrees grow exponentially: the\nsequential and parallel exponential quantum machine learning architectures.\nThis is done by efficiently using the available Hilbert space when encoding,\nincreasing the expressivity of the quantum encoding. Therefore, the exponential\ngrowth allows staying at the low-qubit limit to create highly expressive\ncircuits avoiding barren plateaus. Practically, parallel exponential\narchitecture was shown to outperform the existing linear architectures by\nreducing their final mean square error value by up to 44.7% in a\none-dimensional test problem. Furthermore, the feasibility of this technique\nwas also shown on a trapped ion quantum processing unit.",

Here we\npresent OpenApePose, a new public dataset of 71,868 photographs, annotated with\n16 body landmarks, of six ape species in naturalistic contexts. We show that a\nstandard deep net (HRNet-W48) trained on ape photos can reliably track\nout-of-sample ape photos better than networks trained on monkeys (specifically,\nthe OpenMonkeyPose dataset) and on humans (COCO) can. This trained network can\ntrack apes almost as well as the other networks can track their respective\ntaxa, and models trained without one of the six ape species can track the held\nout species better than the monkey and human models can. Ultimately, the\nresults of our analyses highlight the importance of large specialized databases\nfor animal tracking systems and confirm the utility of our new ape database.",

    "abstract": "Designing efficient and labor-saving prosthetic hands requires powerful hand\ngesture recognition algorithms that can achieve high accuracy with limited\ncomplexity and latency. In this context, the paper proposes a compact deep\nlearning framework referred to as the CT-HGR, which employs a vision\ntransformer network to conduct hand gesture recognition using highdensity sEMG\n(HD-sEMG) signals. The attention mechanism in the proposed model identifies\nsimilarities among different data segments with a greater capacity for parallel\ncomputations and addresses the memory limitation problems while dealing with\ninputs of large sequence lengths. CT-HGR can be trained from scratch without\nany need for transfer learning and can simultaneously extract both temporal and\nspatial features of HD-sEMG data. Additionally, the CT-HGR framework can\nperform instantaneous recognition using sEMG image spatially composed from\nHD-sEMG signals. A variant of the CT-HGR is also designed to incorporate\nmicroscopic neural drive information in the form of Motor Unit Spike Trains\n(MUSTs) extracted from HD-sEMG signals using Blind Source Separation (BSS).\nThis variant is combined with its baseline version via a hybrid architecture to\nevaluate potentials of fusing macroscopic and microscopic neural drive\ninformation. The utilized HD-sEMG dataset involves 128 electrodes that collect\nthe signals related to 65 isometric hand gestures of 20 subjects. The proposed\nCT-HGR framework is applied to 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250 ms window sizes of the\nabove-mentioned dataset utilizing 32, 64, 128 electrode channels. The average\naccuracy over all the participants using 32 electrodes and a window size of\n31.25 ms is 86.23%, which gradually increases till reaching 91.98% for 128\nelectrodes and a window size of 250 ms. The CT-HGR achieves accuracy of 89.13%\nfor instantaneous recognition based on a single frame of HD-sEMG image.",
