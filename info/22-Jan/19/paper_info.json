The gigantic datasets used for pre-training seem to\nbe the key for their success on existing tasks. In this paper, we explore how a\nrange of pre-trained natural language understanding models perform on truly\nnovel and unexplored data, provided by classification tasks over a DarkNet\ncorpus.

PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional\nequations, and integral-differential equations. This novel methodology has\narisen as a multi-task learning framework in which a NN must fit observed data\nwhile reducing a PDE residual. This article provides a comprehensive review of\nthe literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to\ncharacterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages, the\nreview also attempts to incorporate publications on a larger variety of issues,\nincluding physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), where the initial or\nboundary conditions are directly embedded in the NN structure rather than in\nthe loss functions. The study indicates that most research has focused on\ncustomizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient\noptimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function\nstructures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been\nused, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than\nclassical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements\nare still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.",

    "title": "Zero-Shot Machine Unlearning",
    "abstract": "With the introduction of new privacy regulations, machine unlearning is\nbecoming an emerging research problem due to an increasing need for regulatory\ncompliance required for machine learning (ML) applications. Modern privacy\nregulations grant citizens the right to be forgotten by products, services and\ncompanies. This necessitates deletion of data not only from storage archives\nbut also from ML model. The right to be forgotten requests come in the form of\nremoval of a certain set or class of data from the already trained ML model.\nPractical considerations preclude retraining of the model from scratch minus\nthe deleted data. The few existing studies use the whole training data, or a\nsubset of training data, or some metadata stored during training to update the\nmodel weights for unlearning. However, strict regulatory compliance requires\ntime-bound deletion of data. Thus, in many cases, no data related to the\ntraining process or training samples may be accessible even for the unlearning\npurpose. We therefore ask the question: is it possible to achieve unlearning\nwith zero training samples? In this paper, we introduce the novel problem of\nzero-shot machine unlearning that caters for the extreme but practical scenario\nwhere zero original data samples are available for use. We then propose two\nnovel solutions for zero-shot machine unlearning based on (a) error\nminimizing-maximizing noise and (b) gated knowledge transfer. We also introduce\na new evaluation metric, Anamnesis Index (AIN) to effectively measure the\nquality of the unlearning method. The experiments show promising results for\nunlearning in deep learning models on benchmark vision data-sets. The source\ncode will be made publicly available.",

Specifically, we fix a grid defined by the midpoints of\nnon-overlapping bins (dubbed \"slices\") of observation times and ensure that\neach sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows\none to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series\nclassification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute\nindividually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known\nclass imbalance algorithm SMOTE \\cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest\nneighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing\nfeatures. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional\nuncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder\nlong-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and\nclassifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After\nillustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same\narchitecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an\nimputed data set.

When\nresearchers label studies, they can screen ranked documents where relevant\ndocuments are higher than irrelevant ones. This practice, known as screening\nprioritization (ie., document ranking approach), speeds up the process of\nconducting a SR as the documents labelled as relevant can move to the next\ntasks earlier. However, the approach is limited in reducing the manual workload\nbecause the total number of documents to screen remains the same. Towards\nreducing the manual workload in the screening process, we investigate the\nquality of document ranking of SR. This can signal researchers whereabouts in\nthe ranking relevant studies are located and let them decide where to stop the\nscreening. After extensive analysis on SR document rankings from different\nranking models, we hypothesize 'topic broadness' as a factor that affects the\nranking quality of SR. Finally, we propose a measure that estimates the topic\nbroadness and demonstrate that the proposed measure is a simple yet effective\nmethod to predict the qualities of document rankings for SRs.",

Graph neural networks (GNNs) in\nparticular have excelled in predicting material properties within chemical\naccuracy.

    "abstract": "Predicting contextualised engagement in videos is a long-standing problem\nthat has been popularly attempted by exploiting the number of views or the\nassociated likes using different computational methods. The recent decade has\nseen a boom in online learning resources, and during the pandemic, there has\nbeen an exponential rise of online teaching videos without much quality\ncontrol. The quality of the content could be improved if the creators could get\nconstructive feedback on their content. Employing an army of domain expert\nvolunteers to provide feedback on the videos might not scale. As a result,\nthere has been a steep rise in developing computational methods to predict a\nuser engagement score that is indicative of some form of possible user\nengagement, i.e., to what level a user would tend to engage with the content. A\ndrawback in current methods is that they model various features separately, in\na cascaded approach, that is prone to error propagation. Besides, most of them\ndo not provide crucial explanations on how the creator could improve their\ncontent. In this paper, we have proposed a new unified model, CLUE for the\neducational domain, which learns from the features extracted from freely\navailable public online teaching videos and provides explainable feedback on\nthe video along with a user engagement score. Given the complexity of the task,\nour unified framework employs different pre-trained models working together as\nan ensemble of classifiers. Our model exploits various multi-modal features to\nmodel the complexity of language, context agnostic information, textual emotion\nof the delivered content, animation, speaker's pitch and speech emotions.

Besides the detailed specifications\nand our analysis of the protocol, we are making available an open-source\nimplementation of Zef in Rust.

    "abstract": "We study the complexity of determining the edge connectivity of a simple\ngraph with cut queries. We show that (i) there is a bounded-error randomized\nalgorithm that computes edge connectivity with $O(n)$ cut queries, and (ii)\nthere is a bounded-error quantum algorithm that computes edge connectivity with\n$\\~O(\\sqrt{n})$ cut queries. We prove these results using a new technique\ncalled \"star contraction\" to randomly contract edges of a graph while\npreserving non-trivial minimum cuts. In star contraction vertices randomly\ncontract an edge incident on a small set of randomly chosen vertices. In\ncontrast to the related 2-out contraction technique of Ghaffari, Nowicki, and\nThorup [SODA'20], star contraction only contracts vertex-disjoint star\nsubgraphs, which allows it to be efficiently implemented via cut queries.\nThe $O(n)$ bound from item (i) was not known even for the simpler problem of\nconnectivity, and improves the $O(n\\log^3 n)$ bound by Rubinstein, Schramm, and\nWeinberg [ITCS'18]. The bound is tight under the reasonable conjecture that the\nrandomized communication complexity of connectivity is $\\Omega(n\\log n)$, an\nopen question since the seminal work of Babai, Frankl, and Simon [FOCS'86]. The\nbound also excludes using edge connectivity on simple graphs to prove a\nsuperlinear randomized query lower bound for minimizing a symmetric submodular\nfunction. Item (ii) gives a nearly-quadratic separation with the randomized\ncomplexity and addresses an open question of Lee, Santha, and Zhang [SODA'21].\nThe algorithm can also be viewed as making $\\~O(\\sqrt{n})$ matrix-vector\nmultiplication queries to the adjacency matrix.\nFinally, we demonstrate the use of star contraction outside of the cut query\nsetting by designing a one-pass semi-streaming algorithm for computing edge\nconnectivity in the vertex arrival setting. This contrasts with the edge\narrival setting where two passes are required.",

Such situations are\nespecially challenging and can occur for endangered languages with few human\nannotators or having cost constraints to label large amounts of data. Although\nAL is shown to be helpful with large budgets, it is not enough to build\nhigh-quality translation systems in these low-resource conditions.

We also present a\nnovel AL strategy inspired by domain adaptation for NMT and show that it is\neffective for low budgets.

    "abstract": "Unpaired video-to-video translation aims to translate videos between a source\nand a target domain without the need of paired training data, making it more\nfeasible for real applications. Unfortunately, the translated videos generally\nsuffer from temporal and semantic inconsistency. To address this, many existing\nworks adopt spatiotemporal consistency constraints incorporating temporal\ninformation based on motion estimation. However, the inaccuracies in the\nestimation of motion deteriorate the quality of the guidance towards\nspatiotemporal consistency, which leads to unstable translation. In this work,\nwe propose a novel paradigm that regularizes the spatiotemporal consistency by\nsynthesizing motions in input videos with the generated optical flow instead of\nestimating them. Therefore, the synthetic motion can be applied in the\nregularization paradigm to keep motions consistent across domains without the\nrisk of errors in motion estimation.

    "abstract": "We propose a new deterministic methodology to predict RNA sequence and\nprotein folding. Is stem enough for structure prediction? The main idea is to\nconsider all possible stem formation in the given sequence. With the stem loop\nenergy and the strength of stem, we explore how to deterministically utilize\nstem information for RNA sequence and protein folding structure prediction. We\nuse graph notation, where all possible stems are represented as vertices, and\nco-existence as edges. This full Stem-graph presents all possible folding\nstructure, and we pick sub-graph(s) which give the best matching energy for\nfolding structure prediction. We introduce a Stem-Loop score to add structure\ninformation and to speed up the computation. The proposed method can handle\nsecondary structure prediction as well as protein folding with pseudo knots.\nNumerical experiments are done using a laptop and results take only a few\nminutes or seconds. One of the strengths of this approach is in the simplicity\nand flexibility of the algorithm, and it gives deterministic answer. We explore\nprotein sequences from Protein Data Bank, rRNA 5S sequences, and tRNA sequences\nfrom the Gutell Lab. Various experiments and comparisons are included to\nvalidate the propose method.",

    "abstract": "IEEE 802.11ax uses the concept of primary and secondary channels, leading to\nthe Dynamic Bandwidth Channel Access (DBCA) mechanism. By applying DBCA, a\nwireless station can select a wider channel bandwidth, such as 40/80/160 MHz,\nby applying the channel bonding feature. However, during channel bonding,\ninappropriate bandwidth selection can cause collisions. Therefore, to avoid\ncollisions, a well-developed media access control (MAC) protocol is crucial to\neffectively utilize the channel bonding mechanism. In this paper, we address a\ncollision scenario, called Outside Warning Range Problem (OWRP), that may occur\nduring DBCA when a wireless station interferes with another wireless station\nafter channel bonding is performed. Therefore, we propose a MAC layer\nmechanism, Intelligent Bonding Avoiding Collision (IBAC), that adapts the\nchannel bonding level in DBCA in order to avoid the OWRP. We first design a\ntheoretical model based on Markov chains for DBCA while avoiding the OWRP.\nBased on this model, we design a Thompson sampling based Bayesian approach to\nselect the best possible channel bonding level intelligently. We analyze the\nperformance of the IBAC through simulations where it is observed that,\ncomparing to other competing mechanisms, the proposed approach can enhance the\nnetwork performance significantly while avoiding the OWRP.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) links vision and language\nmodalities into a unified embedding space, yielding the tremendous potential\nfor vision-language (VL) tasks. While early concurrent works have begun to\nstudy this potential on a subset of tasks, important questions remain: 1) What\nis the benefit of CLIP on unstudied VL tasks? 2) Does CLIP provide benefit in\nlow-shot or domain-shifted scenarios? 3) Can CLIP improve existing approaches\nwithout impacting inference or pretraining complexity? In this work, we seek to\nanswer these questions through two key contributions. First, we introduce an\nevaluation protocol that includes Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), Visual\nEntailment (SNLI-VE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), across a variety of\ndata availability constraints and conditions of domain shift. Second, we\npropose an approach, named CLIP Targeted Distillation (CLIP-TD), to\nintelligently distill knowledge from CLIP into existing architectures using a\ndynamically weighted objective applied to adaptively selected tokens per\ninstance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed CLIP-TD leads to\nexceptional gains in the low-shot (up to 51.9%) and domain-shifted (up to\n71.3%) conditions of VCR, while simultaneously improving performance under\nstandard fully-supervised conditions (up to 2%), achieving state-of-art\nperformance on VCR compared to other single models that are pretrained with\nimage-text data only. On SNLI-VE, CLIP-TD produces significant gains in\nlow-shot conditions (up to 6.6%) as well as fully supervised (up to 3%). On\nVQA, CLIP-TD provides improvement in low-shot (up to 9%), and in\nfully-supervised (up to 1.3%). Finally, CLIP-TD outperforms concurrent works\nutilizing CLIP for finetuning, as well as baseline naive distillation\napproaches. Code will be made available.",

Recent approaches mostly adopt the\nsophisticated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture the tampering\nartifacts left in the images to locate the manipulated regions. However, these\napproaches ignore the feature correlations, i.e., feature inconsistencies,\nbetween manipulated regions and non-manipulated regions, leading to inferior\ndetection performance. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical Graph\nConvolutional Network (HGCN-Net), which consists of two parallel branches: the\nbackbone network branch and the hierarchical graph representation learning\n(HGRL) branch for image manipulation detection. Specifically, the feature maps\nof a given image are extracted by the backbone network branch, and then the\nfeature correlations within the feature maps are modeled as a set of\nfully-connected graphs for learning the hierarchical graph representation by\nthe HGRL branch. The learned hierarchical graph representation can sufficiently\ncapture the feature correlations across different scales, and thus it provides\nhigh discriminability for distinguishing manipulated and non-manipulated\nregions. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed HGCN-Net not only provides promising detection accuracy, but also\nachieves strong robustness under a variety of common image attacks in the task\nof image manipulation detection, compared to the state-of-the-arts.",

Skeleton-based action recognition is\nan attractive approach which, instead of using RGB pixel data, relies on human\npose information to classify appropriate actions. However, existing algorithms\noften assume ideal conditions that are not representative of real-world\nlimitations, such as noisy input, latency requirements, and edge resource\nconstraints.\nTo address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper presents\nReal-World Graph Convolution Networks (RW-GCNs), an architecture-level solution\nfor meeting the domain constraints of Real World Skeleton-based Action\nRecognition. Inspired by the presence of feedback connections in the human\nvisual cortex, RW-GCNs leverage attentive feedback augmentation on existing\nnear state-of-the-art (SotA) Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Networks\n(ST-GCNs). The ST-GCNs' design choices are derived from information\ntheory-centric principles to address both the spatial and temporal noise\ntypically encountered in end-to-end real-time and on-the-edge smart video\nsystems. Our results demonstrate RW-GCNs' ability to serve these applications\nby achieving a new SotA accuracy on the NTU-RGB-D-120 dataset at 94.1%, and\nachieving 32X less latency than baseline ST-GCN applications while still\nachieving 90.4% accuracy on the Northwestern UCLA dataset in the presence of\nspatial keypoint noise.

    "abstract": "Analytics corresponds to a relevant and challenging phase of Big Data. The\ngeneration of knowledge from extensive data sets (petabyte era) of varying\ntypes, occurring at a speed able to serve decision makers, is practiced using\nmultiple areas of knowledge, such as computing, statistics, data mining, among\nothers. In the Big Data domain, Analytics is also considered as a process\ncapable of adding value to the organizations. Besides the demonstration of\nvalue, Analytics should also consider operational tools and models to support\ndecision making. To adding value, Analytics is also presented as part of some\nBig Data value chains, such the Information Value Chain presented by NIST among\nothers, which are detailed in this article. As well, some maturity models are\npresented, since they represent important structures to favor continuous\nimplementation of Analytics for Big Data, using specific technologies,\ntechniques and methods. Hence, through an in-depth research, using specific\nliterature references and use cases, we seeks to outline an approach to\ndetermine the Analytical Engineering for Big Data Analytics considering four\npillars: Data, Models, Tools and People; and three process groups: Acquisition,\nRetention and Revision; in order to make feasible and to define an\norganization, possibly designated as an Analytics Organization, responsible for\ngenerating knowledge from the data in the field of Big Data Analytics.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new class of policy gradient (PG) methods, namely\nthe block policy mirror descent (BPMD) methods for solving a class of\nregularized reinforcement learning (RL) problems with (strongly) convex\nregularizers. Compared to the traditional PG methods with batch update rule,\nwhich visit and update the policy for every state, BPMD methods have cheap\nper-iteration computation via a partial update rule that performs the policy\nupdate on a sampled state. Despite the nonconvex nature of the problem and a\npartial update rule, BPMD methods achieve fast linear convergence to the global\noptimality. We further extend BPMD methods to the stochastic setting, by\nutilizing stochastic first-order information constructed from samples. We\nestablish $\\cO(1/\\epsilon)$ (resp. $\\cO(1/\\epsilon^2)$) sample complexity for\nthe strongly convex (resp. non-strongly convex) regularizers, with different\nprocedures for constructing the stochastic first-order information, where\n$\\epsilon$ denotes the target accuracy.

The ill-gotten profits on many blockchain trading systems are\nusually laundered into concealed and \"clean\" fund before being cashed out.\nRecently, in order to recover the stolen fund of users and reveal the\nreal-world entities behind the transactions, much effort has been devoted to\ntracking the flow of funds involved in illegal transactions. However, current\napproaches are facing difficulty in estimating the cost and quantifying the\neffectiveness of transaction tracking. This paper models the transaction\nrecords on blockchain as a transaction network, tackle the transaction tracking\ntask as graph searching the transaction network and proposes a general\ntransaction tracking model named as Push-Pop model. Using the three kinds of\nheuristic designs, namely, tracking tendency, weight pollution, and temporal\nreasoning, we rewrite the local push procedure of personalized PageRank for the\nproposed method and name this new ranking method as Transaction Tracking Rank\n(TTR) which is proved to have a constant computational cost. The proposed TTR\nalgorithm is employed in the Push-Pop model for efficient transaction tracking.\nFinally, we define a series of metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the\ntransaction tracking model.

Deep hashing learning as the current mainstream method\nhas achieved satisfactory retrieval performance. On one hand, various deep\nneural networks are used to extract semantic features of remote sensing images.\nOn the other hand, the hashing techniques are subsequently adopted to map the\nhigh-dimensional deep features to the low-dimensional binary codes. This kind\nof methods attempts to learn one hash function for both the query and database\nsamples in a symmetric way. However, with the number of database samples\nincreasing, it is typically time-consuming to generate the hash codes of\nlarge-scale database images. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hashing\nmethod, named asymmetric hash code learning (AHCL), for RSIR. The proposed AHCL\ngenerates the hash codes of query and database images in an asymmetric way. In\nmore detail, the hash codes of query images are obtained by binarizing the\noutput of the network, while the hash codes of database images are directly\nlearned by solving the designed objective function. In addition, we combine the\nsemantic information of each image and the similarity information of pairs of\nimages as supervised information to train a deep hashing network, which\nimproves the representation ability of deep features and hash codes.

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have exhibited their great power in a\nvariety of vision tasks. However, the lack of transform-invariant property\nlimits their further applications in complicated real-world scenarios. In this\nwork, we proposed a novel generalized one dimension convolutional operator\n(OneDConv), which dynamically transforms the convolution kernels based on the\ninput features in a computationally and parametrically efficient manner. The\nproposed operator can extract the transform-invariant features naturally. It\nimproves the robustness and generalization of convolution without sacrificing\nthe performance on common images. The proposed OneDConv operator can substitute\nthe vanilla convolution, thus it can be incorporated into current popular\nconvolutional architectures and trained end-to-end readily. On several popular\nbenchmarks, OneDConv outperforms the original convolution operation and other\nproposed models both in canonical and distorted images.",

Previous work mainly focused on\nlearning better representation via (mask) language model pre-training but\nignored the intrinsic structure of the music, which is extremely important to\nthe emotional expression of music. In this paper, we present a simple\nmulti-task framework for SMER, which incorporates the emotion recognition task\nwith other emotion-related auxiliary tasks derived from the intrinsic structure\nof the music. The results show that our multi-task framework can be adapted to\ndifferent models. Moreover, the labels of auxiliary tasks are easy to be\nobtained, which means our multi-task methods do not require manually annotated\nlabels other than emotion. Conducting on two publicly available datasets\n(EMOPIA and VGMIDI), the experiments show that our methods perform better in\nSMER task. Specifically, accuracy has been increased by 4.17 absolute point to\n67.58 in EMOPIA dataset, and 1.97 absolute point to 55.85 in VGMIDI dataset.\nAblation studies also show the effectiveness of multi-task methods designed in\nthis paper.",

However, most clustering-based methods take each\ncluster as a pseudo identity class, neglecting the intra-cluster variance\nmainly caused by the change of cameras. To address this issue, we propose to\nsplit each single cluster into multiple proxies according to camera views. The\ncamera-aware proxies explicitly capture local structures within clusters, by\nwhich the intra-ID variance and inter-ID similarity can be better tackled.\nAssisted with the camera-aware proxies, we design two proxy-level contrastive\nlearning losses that are, respectively, based on offline and online association\nresults. The offline association directly associates proxies according to the\nclustering and splitting results, while the online strategy dynamically\nassociates proxies in terms of up-to-date features to reduce the noise caused\nby the delayed update of pseudo labels.

    "abstract": "Researchers and practitioners have recently proposed many Microservices\nArchitecture (MSA) patterns and strategies covering various aspects of\nmicroservices system life cycle, such as service design and security. However,\nselecting and implementing these patterns and strategies can entail various\nchallenges for microservices practitioners. To this end, this study proposes\ndecision models for selecting patterns and strategies covering four MSA design\nareas: application decomposition into microservices, microservices security,\nmicroservices communication, and service discovery. We used peer-reviewed and\ngrey literature to identify the patterns, strategies, and quality attributes\nfor creating these decision models. To evaluate the familiarity,\nunderstandability, completeness, and usefulness of the decision models, we\nconducted semi-structured interviews with 24 microservices practitioners from\n12 countries across five continents. Our evaluation results show that the\npractitioners found the decision models as an effective guide to select\nmicroservices patterns and strategies.",

    "abstract": "Over recent decades have witnessed considerable progress in whether\nmulti-task learning or multi-view learning, but the situation that consider\nboth learning scenes simultaneously has received not too much attention. How to\nutilize multiple views latent representation of each single task to improve\neach learning task performance is a challenge problem. Based on this, we\nproposed a novel semi-supervised algorithm, termed as Multi-Task Multi-View\nlearning based on Common and Special Features (MTMVCSF). In general,\nmulti-views are the different aspects of an object and every view includes the\nunderlying common or special information of this object. As a consequence, we\nwill mine multiple views jointly latent factor of each learning task which\nconsists of each view special feature and the common feature of all views. By\nthis way, the original multi-task multi-view data has degenerated into\nmulti-task data, and exploring the correlations among multiple tasks enables to\nmake an improvement on the performance of learning algorithm. Another obvious\nadvantage of this approach is that we get latent representation of the set of\nunlabeled instances by the constraint of regression task with labeled\ninstances. The performance of classification and semi-supervised clustering\ntask in these latent representations perform obviously better than it in raw\ndata. Furthermore, an anti-noise multi-task multi-view algorithm called\nAN-MTMVCSF is proposed, which has a strong adaptability to noise labels. The\neffectiveness of these algorithms is proved by a series of well-designed\nexperiments on both real world and synthetic data.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes wireless network control for remote estimation of linear\ntime-invariant (LTI) dynamical systems under various Hybrid Automatic Repeat\nRequest (HARQ) based packet retransmission schemes. In conventional HARQ,\npacket reliability increases gradually with additional packets; however, each\nretransmission maximally increases the Age of Information (AoI). A slight\nincrease in AoI can cause severe degradation in mean squared error (MSE)\nperformance. We optimize standard HARQ schemes by allowing partial\nretransmissions to increase the packet reliability gradually and limit the AoI\ngrowth. In incremental redundancy HARQ (IR-HARQ), we utilize a shorter time for\nretransmission, which improves the MSE performance by enabling the early\narrival of fresh status updates. In Chase combining HARQ (CC-HARQ), since\npacket length remains fixed, we propose sending retransmission for an old\nupdate and new updates in a single time slot using non-orthogonal signaling.\nNon-orthogonal retransmissions increase the packet reliability without delaying\nthe fresh updates. Using the Markov decision process formulation, we find the\noptimal policies of the proposed HARQ based schemes to optimize the MSE\nperformance. We provide static and dynamic policy optimization techniques to\nimprove the MSE performance.

Towards this, various deep learning based\nsolutions using convolutional neural networks have been proposed for parking\nspace occupation detection.

Looking in this direction, this paper\ninvestigates the use of dehazing networks that improves the performance of\nparking space occupancy classifier under hazy conditions. Additionally,\ntraining procedures are proposed for dehazing networks to maximize the\nperformance of the system on both hazy and non-hazy conditions.

Previous works mainly focus on homogeneous recommendation and little\nprogress has been made for heterogeneous recommender systems. However,\nheterogeneous recommendations, e.g., recommending different types of items\nincluding products, videos, celebrity shopping notes, among many others, are\ndominant nowadays. State-of-the-art methods are incapable of leveraging\nattributes from different types of items and thus suffer from data sparsity\nproblems. And it is indeed quite challenging to represent items with different\nfeature spaces jointly. To tackle this problem, we propose a kernel-based\nneural network, namely deep unified representation (or DURation) for\nheterogeneous recommendation, to jointly model unified representations of\nheterogeneous items while preserving their original feature space topology\nstructures. Theoretically, we prove the representation ability of the proposed\nmodel. Besides, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate that with the unified representation, our\nmodel achieves remarkable improvement (e.g., 4.1% ~ 34.9% lift by AUC score and\n3.7% lift by online CTR) over existing state-of-the-art models.",

Recent text simplification efforts rely on manually\ncrafted simplified corpora and comprehensive NLP tools that can analyse the\ntarget text both in word and sentence levels. Turkish is a morphologically rich\nagglutinative language that requires unique considerations such as the proper\nhandling of inflectional cases. Being a low-resource language in terms of\navailable resources and industrial-strength tools, it makes the text\nsimplification task harder to approach. We present a new text simplification\npipeline based on pretrained representation model BERT together with\nmorphological features to generate grammatically correct and semantically\nappropriate word-level simplifications.",

Our results show that the encoders stolen by\nStolenEncoder have similar functionality with the target encoders.

We formulate a simple decision rule based on this criterion and\nempirically show it predicts instance-level generalization well across 5\ndifferent semantic parsing datasets, substantially better than alternative\ndecision rules.

The free-fall stage of skydiving is investigated, when aerial\nmaneuvers are performed by changing the body posture and thus deflecting the\nsurrounding airflow. The natural learning process of body flight is hard and\nprotracted since the required movements are not similar to our daily movement\nrepertoire, and often counter-intuitive. The proposed method can provide a\nvaluable insight into the subject's learning process and may be used by coaches\nto identify potentially successful technique changes. The main novelty is that\ninstead of comparing directly the trainee's movements to a template or a\nmovement pattern, extracted from a top-rated athlete in the field, we offer an\nindependent way of technique analysis. We incorporate design tools of automatic\ncontrol theory to link the trainee's movement patterns to specific performance\ncharacteristics. This makes it possible to suggest technique modifications that\nprovide the desired performance improvement, taking into account the individual\nbody parameters and constraints. Representing the performed maneuvers in terms\nof a dynamic response of closed-loop control system offers an unconventional\ninsight into the motor equivalence problem.

In traditional reinforcement learning, actor-critic algorithms generally\nuse the recursive least squares (RLS) technology to update the parameter of\nlinear function approximators for accelerating their convergence speed.\nHowever, A2C algorithms seldom use this technology to train deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) for improving their sample efficiency. In this paper, we\npropose two novel RLS-based A2C algorithms and investigate their performance.\nBoth proposed algorithms, called RLSSA2C and RLSNA2C, use the RLS method to\ntrain the critic network and the hidden layers of the actor network. The main\ndifference between them is at the policy learning step. RLSSA2C uses an\nordinary first-order gradient descent algorithm and the standard policy\ngradient to learn the policy parameter. RLSNA2C uses the Kronecker-factored\napproximation, the RLS method and the natural policy gradient to learn the\ncompatible parameter and the policy parameter. In addition, we analyze the\ncomplexity and convergence of both algorithms, and present three tricks for\nfurther improving their convergence speed. Finally, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of both algorithms on 40 games in the Atari 2600 environment and\n11 tasks in the MuJoCo environment.

However, technological\nresources, people and processes are crucial to facilitate the management of big\ndata in any kind of organization, allowing information and knowledge from a\nlarge volume of data to support decision-making. Big data management can be\nsupported by these three dimensions: technology, people and processes.

    "abstract": "In order to improve the penetration of renewable energy resources for\ndistribution networks, a joint planning model of distributed generations (DGs)\nand energy storage is proposed for an active distribution network by using a\nbi-level programming approach in this paper. In this model, the upper-level\naims to seek the optimal location and capacity of DGs and energy storage, while\nthe lower-level optimizes the operation of energy storage devices. To solve\nthis model, an improved binary particle swarm optimization (IBPSO) algorithm\nbased on chaos optimization is developed, and the optimal joint planning is\nachieved through alternating iterations between the two levels. The simulation\nresults on the PG & E 69-bus distribution system demonstrate that the presented\napproach manages to reduce the planning deviation caused by the uncertainties\nof DG outputs and remarkably improve the voltage profile and operational\neconomy of distribution systems.",

This paper presents a dataset with over 2.3M submissions and 16.2M\ncomments posted from 113K users in 7.1K subverses (the equivalent of subreddit\nfor Voat). Our dataset covers the whole lifetime of Voat, from its developing\nperiod starting on November 8, 2013, the day it was founded, April 2014, up\nuntil the day it shut down (December 25, 2020). This work presents the largest\nand most complete publicly available Voat dataset, to the best of our\nknowledge. We also present a preliminary analysis to cover posting activity and\ndaily user and subverse registration on the platform so that researchers\ninterested in our dataset can know what to expect. Our data may prove helpful\nto false news dissemination studies as we analyze the links users share on the\nplatform, finding that many communities rely on alternative news press, like\nBreitbart and GatewayPundit, for their daily discussions. Last, we perform\nnetwork analysis on user interactions finding that many users prefer not to\ninteract with subverses outside their narrative interests, which could be\nhelpful to researchers focusing on polarization and echo chambers. Also, since\nVoat was one of the platforms many Reddit users migrated to after a ban, we are\nconfident that our dataset will motivate and assist researchers studying\ndeplatforming. In addition, many hateful and conspiratorial communities seem to\nbe very popular on Voat, which makes our work valuable for researchers focusing\non toxicity, conspiracy theories, cross-platform studies of social networks,\nand natural language processing.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the political polarization in Twitter\ndiscussions about inflation during the COVID-19 pandemic using a dataset\ncomposed of more than 20,000 vetted tweets posted by over 8,000 unique Twitter\nusers from July to November in 2021. Our analysis shows the timing of the\nvolume changes in online discussions roughly corresponds to the dates when the\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The\nusage of the hashtags varies across left- and right-leaning users. Left-leaning\nusers tend to discuss more diverse subtopics while right-leaning users focus on\nblaming U.S. President Joe Biden for the inflation. Unlike previous studies, we\ncharacterize political polarization by jointly modeling user information, their\nconnections, and the multi-modal post contents in a heterogeneous graph. By\nmapping the node embeddings into a two-dimensional space, we find there is\nclear segregation between left- and right-leaning users. Although using only\none of the features or the concatenation does not improve the performance of\nmodeling, we find notable differences in user descriptions, topics, images, and\nlevels of retweet activities. Our framework shows wide applicability and can be\nfurther extended by integrating other modalities of data and more relations.\nThe findings have implications for understanding online political polarization\nand designing mitigation policies for potentially negative outcome of extreme\npolarization.",

The notion of an universally consistent learning was\ndefined by Hanneke in an effort to study learning theory under minimal\nassumptions, where the objective is to obtain low long-run average loss for any\ntarget function. We are interested in characterizing processes for which\nlearning is possible and whether there exist learning rules guaranteed to be\nuniversally consistent given the only assumption that such learning is\npossible. The case of unbounded losses is very restrictive, since the learnable\nprocesses almost surely visit a finite number of points and as a result, simple\nmemorization is optimistically universal. We focus on the bounded setting and\ngive a complete characterization of the processes admitting strong and weak\nuniversal learning. We further show that k-nearest neighbor algorithm (kNN) is\nnot optimistically universal and present a novel variant of 1NN which is\noptimistically universal for general input and value spaces in both strong and\nweak setting.

We introduce a novel paradigm for dataset\ncreation based on human and machine collaboration, which brings together the\ngenerative strength of language models and the evaluative strength of humans.\nStarting with an existing dataset, MultiNLI, our approach uses dataset\ncartography to automatically identify examples that demonstrate challenging\nreasoning patterns, and instructs GPT-3 to compose new examples with similar\npatterns. Machine generated examples are then automatically filtered, and\nfinally revised and labeled by human crowdworkers to ensure quality. The\nresulting dataset, WANLI, consists of 108,357 natural language inference (NLI)\nexamples that present unique empirical strengths over existing NLI datasets.\nRemarkably, training a model on WANLI instead of MNLI (which is 4 times larger)\nimproves performance on seven out-of-domain test sets we consider, including by\n11% on HANS and 9% on Adversarial NLI. Moreover, combining MNLI with WANLI is\nmore effective than combining with other augmentation sets that have been\nintroduced.

    "abstract": "Patients are often encouraged to make use of wearable devices for remote\ncollection and monitoring of health data. This adoption of wearables results in\na significant increase in the volume of data collected and transmitted. The\nbattery life of the devices is then quickly diminished due to the high\nprocessing requirements of the devices. Given the importance attached to\nmedical data, it is imperative that all transmitted data adhere to strict\nintegrity and availability requirements. Reducing the volume of healthcare data\nfor network transmission may improve sensor battery life without compromising\naccuracy. There is a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy which can be\ncontrolled by adjusting the sampling and transmission rates. This paper\ndemonstrates that machine learning can be used to analyse complex health data\nmetrics such as the accuracy and efficiency of data transmission to overcome\nthe trade-off problem. The study uses time series nonlinear autoregressive\nneural network algorithms to enhance both data metrics by taking fewer samples\nto transmit. The algorithms were tested with a standard heart rate dataset to\ncompare their accuracy and efficiency. The result showed that the\nLevenbery-Marquardt algorithm was the best performer with an efficiency of 3.33\nand accuracy of 79.17%, which is similar to other algorithms accuracy but\ndemonstrates improved efficiency.

Differentially private\nalgorithms address this challenge by slightly perturbing underlying statistics\nwith noise, thereby mathematically limiting the amount of information that may\nbe deduced from each data release. Properly calibrating these algorithms -- and\nin turn the disclosure risk for people described in the dataset -- requires a\ndata curator to choose a value for a privacy budget parameter, $\\epsilon$.\nHowever, there is little formal guidance for choosing $\\epsilon$, a task that\nrequires reasoning about the probabilistic privacy-utility trade-off.\nFurthermore, choosing $\\epsilon$ in the context of statistical inference\nrequires reasoning about accuracy trade-offs in the presence of both\nmeasurement error and differential privacy (DP) noise.\nWe present Visualizing Privacy (ViP), an interactive interface that\nvisualizes relationships between $\\epsilon$, accuracy, and disclosure risk to\nsupport setting and splitting $\\epsilon$ among queries. As a user adjusts\n$\\epsilon$, ViP dynamically updates visualizations depicting expected accuracy\nand risk. ViP also has an inference setting, allowing a user to reason about\nthe impact of DP noise on statistical inferences. Finally, we present results\nof a study where 16 research practitioners with little to no DP background\ncompleted a set of tasks related to setting $\\epsilon$ using both ViP and a\ncontrol. We find that ViP helps participants more correctly answer questions\nrelated to judging the probability of where a DP-noised release is likely to\nfall and comparing between DP-noised and non-private confidence intervals.",

    "abstract": "Structured knowledge grounding (SKG) leverages structured knowledge to\ncomplete user requests, such as semantic parsing over databases and question\nanswering over knowledge bases. Since the inputs and outputs of SKG tasks are\nheterogeneous, they have been studied separately by different communities,\nwhich limits systematic and compatible research on SKG. In this paper, we\novercome this limitation by proposing the SKG framework, which unifies 21 SKG\ntasks into a text-to-text format, aiming to promote systematic SKG research,\ninstead of being exclusive to a single task, domain, or dataset. We use\nUnifiedSKG to benchmark T5 with different sizes and show that T5, with simple\nmodifications when necessary, achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost\nall of the 21 tasks. We further demonstrate that multi-task prefix-tuning\nimproves the performance on most tasks, largely improving the overall\nperformance. UnifiedSKG also facilitates the investigation of zero-shot and\nfew-shot learning, and we show that T0, GPT-3, and Codex struggle in zero-shot\nand few-shot learning for SKG. We also use UnifiedSKG to conduct a series of\ncontrolled experiments on structured knowledge encoding variants across SKG\ntasks. UnifiedSKG is easily extensible to more tasks, and it is open-sourced at\nhttps://github.com/hkunlp/unifiedskg; latest collections at\nhttps://unifiedskg.com.",

    "title": "Learning from Atypical Behavior: Temporary Interest Aware Recommendation  Based on Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Traditional robust recommendation methods view atypical user-item\ninteractions as noise and aim to reduce their impact with some kind of noise\nfiltering technique, which often suffers from two challenges. First, in real\nworld, atypical interactions may signal users' temporary interest different\nfrom their general preference. Therefore, simply filtering out the atypical\ninteractions as noise may be inappropriate and degrade the personalization of\nrecommendations. Second, it is hard to acquire the temporary interest since\nthere are no explicit supervision signals to indicate whether an interaction is\natypical or not. To address this challenges, we propose a novel model called\nTemporary Interest Aware Recommendation (TIARec), which can distinguish\natypical interactions from normal ones without supervision and capture the\ntemporary interest as well as the general preference of users. Particularly, we\npropose a reinforcement learning framework containing a recommender agent and\nan auxiliary classifier agent, which are jointly trained with the objective of\nmaximizing the cumulative return of the recommendations made by the recommender\nagent. During the joint training process, the classifier agent can judge\nwhether the interaction with an item recommended by the recommender agent is\natypical, and the knowledge about learning temporary interest from atypical\ninteractions can be transferred to the recommender agent, which makes the\nrecommender agent able to alone make recommendations that balance the general\npreference and temporary interest of users. At last, the experiments conducted\non real world datasets verify the effectiveness of TIARec.",

Recent literature addresses these problems by\ntime-consuming grouping processes such as dual-clustering, mean-shift offsets,\netc., or by bird-eye-view (BEV) dense centroid representation that downplays\ngeometry. However, the long-range geometry relationship has not been\nsufficiently modeled by local feature learning from the above methods. To this\nend, we present SCAN, a novel sparse cross-scale attention network to first\nalign multi-scale sparse features with global voxel-encoded attention to\ncapture the long-range relationship of instance context, which can boost the\nregression accuracy of the over-segmented large objects. For the\nsurface-aggregated points, SCAN adopts a novel sparse class-agnostic\nrepresentation of instance centroids, which can not only maintain the sparsity\nof aligned features to solve the under-segmentation on small objects, but also\nreduce the computation amount of the network through sparse convolution.

    "abstract": "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been attracting increasing attention of\nresearchers for its ability to alleviate the data sparsity problem in\nrecommender systems. However, the existing single-target or dual-target CDR\nmethods often suffer from two drawbacks, the assumption of at least one rich\ndomain and the heavy dependence on domain-invariant preference, which are\nimpractical in real world where sparsity is ubiquitous and might degrade the\nuser preference learning. To overcome these issues, we propose a\nMulti-Sparse-Domain Collaborative Recommendation (MSDCR) model for multi-target\ncross-domain recommendation. Unlike traditional CDR methods, MSDCR treats the\nmultiple relevant domains as all sparse and can simultaneously improve the\nrecommendation performance in each domain. We propose a Multi-Domain Separation\nNetwork (MDSN) and a Gated Aspect Preference Enhancement (GAPE) module for\nMSDCR to enhance a user's domain-specific aspect preferences in a domain by\ntransferring the complementary aspect preferences in other domains, during\nwhich the uniqueness of the domain-specific preference can be preserved through\nthe adversarial training offered by MDSN and the complementarity can be\nadaptively determined by GAPE. Meanwhile, we propose a Multi-Domain Adaptation\nNetwork (MDAN) for MSDCR to capture a user's domain-invariant aspect\npreference. With the integration of the enhanced domain-specific aspect\npreference and the domain-invariant aspect preference, MSDCR can reach a\ncomprehensive understanding of a user's preference in each sparse domain.

Automated systems are favored\nover manual ones in the current environment. Home Automation is becoming more\npopular in this scenario, as people are drawn to the concept of a home\nenvironment that can automatically satisfy users' requirements. The key\nchallenges in an intelligent home are intelligent decision making,\nlocation-aware service, and compatibility for all users of different ages and\nphysical conditions. Existing solutions address just one or two of these\nchallenges, but smart home automation that is robust, intelligent,\nlocation-aware, and predictive is needed to satisfy the user's demand. This\npaper presents a location-aware intelligent RSSI-based home automation system\n(IRHA) that uses Wi-Fi signals to detect the user's location and control the\nappliances automatically. The fingerprinting method is used to map the Wi-Fi\nsignals for different rooms, and the machine learning method, such as Decision\nTree, is used to classify the signals for different rooms. The machine learning\nmodels are then implemented in the ESP32 microcontroller board to classify the\nrooms based on the real-time Wi-Fi signal, and then the result is sent to the\nmain control board through the ESP32 MAC communication protocol to control the\nappliances automatically.

    "abstract": "Mapping and localization are two essential tasks for mobile robots in\nreal-world applications. However, largescale and dynamic scenes challenge the\naccuracy and robustness of most current mature solutions. This situation\nbecomes even worse when computational resources are limited. In this paper, we\npresent a novel lightweight object-level mapping and localization method with\nhigh accuracy and robustness. Different from previous methods, our method does\nnot need a prior constructed precise geometric map, which greatly releases the\nstorage burden, especially for large-scale navigation. We use object-level\nfeatures with both semantic and geometric information to model landmarks in the\nenvironment. Particularly, a learning topological primitive is first proposed\nto efficiently obtain and organize the object-level landmarks. On the basis of\nthis, we use a robot-centric mapping framework to represent the environment as\na semantic topology graph and relax the burden of maintaining global\nconsistency at the same time. Besides, a hierarchical memory management\nmechanism is introduced to improve the efficiency of online mapping with\nlimited computational resources. Based on the proposed map, the robust\nlocalization is achieved by constructing a novel local semantic scene graph\ndescriptor, and performing multi-constraint graph matching to compare scene\nsimilarity. Finally, we test our method on a low-cost embedded platform to\ndemonstrate its advantages.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised sentence embedding aims to obtain the most appropriate embedding\nfor a sentence to reflect its semantic. Contrastive learning has been\nattracting developing attention. For a sentence, current models utilize diverse\ndata augmentation methods to generate positive samples, while consider other\nindependent sentences as negative samples. Then they adopt InfoNCE loss to pull\nthe embeddings of positive pairs gathered, and push those of negative pairs\nscattered. Although these models have made great progress on sentence\nembedding, we argue that they may suffer from feature suppression. The models\nfail to distinguish and decouple textual similarity and semantic similarity.\nAnd they may overestimate the semantic similarity of any pairs with similar\ntextual regardless of the actual semantic difference between them. This is\nbecause positive pairs in unsupervised contrastive learning come with similar\nand even the same textual through data augmentation. To alleviate feature\nsuppression, we propose contrastive learning for unsupervised sentence\nembedding with soft negative samples (SNCSE). Soft negative samples share\nhighly similar textual but have surely and apparently different semantic with\nthe original samples. Specifically, we take the negation of original sentences\nas soft negative samples, and propose Bidirectional Margin Loss (BML) to\nintroduce them into traditional contrastive learning framework, which merely\ninvolves positive and negative samples.

    "abstract": "Neural graphics primitives, parameterized by fully connected neural networks,\ncan be costly to train and evaluate. We reduce this cost with a versatile new\ninput encoding that permits the use of a smaller network without sacrificing\nquality, thus significantly reducing the number of floating point and memory\naccess operations: a small neural network is augmented by a multiresolution\nhash table of trainable feature vectors whose values are optimized through\nstochastic gradient descent. The multiresolution structure allows the network\nto disambiguate hash collisions, making for a simple architecture that is\ntrivial to parallelize on modern GPUs. We leverage this parallelism by\nimplementing the whole system using fully-fused CUDA kernels with a focus on\nminimizing wasted bandwidth and compute operations. We achieve a combined\nspeedup of several orders of magnitude, enabling training of high-quality\nneural graphics primitives in a matter of seconds, and rendering in tens of\nmilliseconds at a resolution of ${1920\\!\\times\\!1080}$.",

    "abstract": "Transformer models have shown great success modeling long-range interactions.\nNevertheless, they scale quadratically with input length and lack inductive\nbiases. These limitations can be further exacerbated when dealing with the high\ndimensionality of video. Proper modeling of video, which can span from seconds\nto hours, requires handling long-range interactions. This makes Transformers a\npromising tool for solving video related tasks, but some adaptations are\nrequired. While there are previous works that study the advances of\nTransformers for vision tasks, there is none that focus on in-depth analysis of\nvideo-specific designs. In this survey we analyse and summarize the main\ncontributions and trends for adapting Transformers to model video data.\nSpecifically, we delve into how videos are embedded and tokenized, finding a\nvery widspread use of large CNN backbones to reduce dimensionality and a\npredominance of patches and frames as tokens. Furthermore, we study how the\nTransformer layer has been tweaked to handle longer sequences, generally by\nreducing the number of tokens in single attention operation. Also, we analyse\nthe self-supervised losses used to train Video Transformers, which to date are\nmostly constrained to contrastive approaches. Finally, we explore how other\nmodalities are integrated with video and conduct a performance comparison on\nthe most common benchmark for Video Transformers (i.e., action classification),\nfinding them to outperform 3D CNN counterparts with equivalent FLOPs and no\nsignificant parameter increase.",

The\nhigh level objective in both problems is to pack arriving items of sizes at\nmost 1 into bins of capacity 1 as efficiently as possible, but the exact\nformalizations differ.

On the other hand,\nin the removable knapsack problem there is a fixed number of bins, and the goal\nof packing items, which consists in choosing a particular bin for every packed\nitem (and nothing else), is to pack as valuable a subset as possible.

One failure mode is misinterpreting a user's\ninstruction (e.g., GPT-3 interpreting \"What word is similar to good?\" to mean a\nhomonym, while the user intended a synonym). Our goal is to allow users to\ncorrect such errors directly through interaction -- without retraining. Our\napproach pairs GPT-3 with a growing memory of cases where the model\nmisunderstood the user's intent and was provided with feedback, clarifying the\ninstruction. Given a new query, our memory-enhanced GPT-3 uses feedback from\nsimilar, prior queries to enrich the prompt. Through simple proof-of-concept\nexperiments, we show how a (simulated) user can interactively teach a deployed\nGPT-3, doubling its accuracy on basic lexical tasks (e.g., generate a synonym)\nwhere users query in different, novel (often misunderstood) ways. In such\nscenarios, memory helps avoid repeating similar past mistakes. Our simple idea\nis a first step towards strengthening deployed models, potentially broadening\ntheir utility.

    "abstract": "The multi-agent pickup and delivery (MAPD) problem, in which multiple agents\niteratively carry materials without collisions, has received significant\nattention. However, many conventional MAPD algorithms assume a specifically\ndesigned grid-like environment, such as an automated warehouse. Therefore, they\nhave many pickup and delivery locations where agents can stay for a lengthy\nperiod, as well as plentiful detours to avoid collisions owing to the freedom\nof movement in a grid. By contrast, because a maze-like environment such as a\nsearch-and-rescue or construction site has fewer pickup/delivery locations and\ntheir numbers may be unbalanced, many agents concentrate on such locations\nresulting in inefficient operations, often becoming stuck or deadlocked. Thus,\nto improve the transportation efficiency even in a maze-like restricted\nenvironment, we propose a deadlock avoidance method, called standby-based\ndeadlock avoidance (SBDA). SBDA uses standby nodes determined in real-time\nusing the articulation-point-finding algorithm, and the agent is guaranteed to\nstay there for a finite amount of time.

Recent\nreports have shown that certain demographic groups may receive less favorable\ntreatment under pure profit maximization. As a result, a collection of online\nmatching algorithms have been developed that give a fair treatment guarantee\nfor one side of the market at the expense of a drop in the operator's profit.\nIn this paper, we generalize the existing work to offer fair treatment\nguarantees to both sides of the market simultaneously, at a calculated worst\ncase drop to operator profit.

    "title": "Sequential Recommendation via Stochastic Self-Attention",
    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation models the dynamics of a user's previous behaviors\nin order to forecast the next item, and has drawn a lot of attention.\nTransformer-based approaches, which embed items as vectors and use dot-product\nself-attention to measure the relationship between items, demonstrate superior\ncapabilities among existing sequential methods. However, users' real-world\nsequential behaviors are \\textit{\\textbf{uncertain}} rather than deterministic,\nposing a significant challenge to present techniques. We further suggest that\ndot-product-based approaches cannot fully capture \\textit{\\textbf{collaborative\ntransitivity}}, which can be derived in item-item transitions inside sequences\nand is beneficial for cold start items. We further argue that BPR loss has no\nconstraint on positive and sampled negative items, which misleads the\noptimization. We propose a novel \\textbf{STO}chastic\n\\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{A}ttention~(STOSA) to overcome these issues. STOSA, in\nparticular, embeds each item as a stochastic Gaussian distribution, the\ncovariance of which encodes the uncertainty. We devise a novel Wasserstein\nSelf-Attention module to characterize item-item position-wise relationships in\nsequences, which effectively incorporates uncertainty into model training.\nWasserstein attentions also enlighten the collaborative transitivity learning\nas it satisfies triangle inequality. Moreover, we introduce a novel\nregularization term to the ranking loss, which assures the dissimilarity\nbetween positive and the negative items. Extensive experiments on five\nreal-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model\nover state-of-the-art baselines, especially on cold start items.

    "abstract": "How to use multiple optical satellite images to recover the 3D scene\nstructure is a challenging and important problem in the remote sensing field.\nMost existing methods in literature have been explored based on the classical\nRPC (rational polynomial camera) model which requires at least 39 GCPs (ground\ncontrol points), however, it is not trivial to obtain such a large number of\nGCPs in many real scenes. Addressing this problem, we propose a hierarchical\nreconstruction framework based on multiple optical satellite images, which\nneeds only 4 GCPs. The proposed framework is composed of an affine dense\nreconstruction stage and a followed affine-to-Euclidean upgrading stage: At the\naffine dense reconstruction stage, an affine dense reconstruction approach is\nexplored for pursuing the 3D affine scene structure without any GCP from input\nsatellite images. Then at the affine-to-Euclidean upgrading stage, the obtained\n3D affine structure is upgraded to a Euclidean one with 4 GCPs.

The advantage of steganography over\ncryptography is that the intended secret message does not attract attention and\nis thus more suitable for secret communication in a highly-surveillant\nenvironment such as civil disobedience movements. Internet memes in social\nmedia and messaging apps have become a popular culture worldwide, so this folk\ncustom is a good application scenario for image steganography. We try to\nexplore and adopt the steganography techniques on the Internet memes in this\nwork. We implement and improve the HiDDeN model by changing the Conv-BN-ReLU\nblocks convolution layer with a multiscale autoencoder network so that the\nneural network learns to embed message bits in higher-level feature space.\nCompared to methods that convolve feature filters on the row-pixel domain, our\nproposed MS-Hidden network learns to hide secrets in both low-level and\nhigh-level image features. As a result, the proposed model significantly\nreduces the bit-error rate to empirically 0% and the required network\nparameters are much less than the HiDDeN model.",

Since test\nsuites are costly to execute, industry needs methods for test case\nprioritisation (TCP). Recently, TCP methods use machine learning (ML) to\nexploit the information known about the system under test (SUT) and its test\ncases. However, the value added by ML-based TCP methods should be critically\nassessed with respect to the cost of collecting the information. This paper\nanalyses two decades of TCP research, and presents a taxonomy of 91 information\nattributes that have been used. The attributes are classified with respect to\ntheir information sources and the characteristics of their extraction process.\nBased on this taxonomy, TCP methods validated with industrial data and those\napplying ML are analysed in terms of information availability, attribute\ncombination and definition of data features suitable for ML. Relying on a high\nnumber of information attributes, assuming easy access to SUT code and\nsimplified testing environments are identified as factors that might hamper\nindustrial applicability of ML-based TCP.

This amplifies the ability of censoring authorities to\nrestrict user access to certain data/websites/applications and monitor user\nrequests. The majority of existing NDN-based frameworks have focused on\nenabling users in a censoring network to access data available outside of this\nnetwork, without considering how data producers in a censoring network can make\ntheir data available to users outside of this network. This problem becomes\nespecially challenging, since the NDN communication paths are symmetric, while\nproducers are mandated to sign the data they generate and identify their\ncertificates. In this paper, we propose Harpocrates, an NDN-based framework for\nanonymous data publication under censorship conditions. Harpocrates enables\nproducers in censoring networks to produce and make their data available to\nusers outside of these networks while remaining anonymous to censoring\nauthorities.

    "title": "Debiased Recommendation with User Feature Balancing",
    "abstract": "Debiased recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention from both\nindustry and academic communities. Traditional models mostly rely on the\ninverse propensity score (IPS), which can be hard to estimate and may suffer\nfrom the high variance issue. To alleviate these problems, in this paper, we\npropose a novel debiased recommendation framework based on user feature\nbalancing. The general idea is to introduce a projection function to adjust\nuser feature distributions, such that the ideal unbiased learning objective can\nbe upper bounded by a solvable objective purely based on the offline dataset.\nIn the upper bound, the projected user distributions are expected to be equal\ngiven different items. From the causal inference perspective, this requirement\naims to remove the causal relation from the user to the item, which enables us\nto achieve unbiased recommendation, bypassing the computation of IPS. In order\nto efficiently balance the user distributions upon each item pair, we propose\nthree strategies, including clipping, sampling and adversarial learning to\nimprove the training process. For more robust optimization, we deploy an\nexplicit model to capture the potential latent confounders in recommendation\nsystems. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work on debiased\nrecommendation based on confounder balancing. In the experiments, we compare\nour framework with many state-of-the-art methods based on synthetic,\nsemi-synthetic and real-world datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour model is effective in promoting the recommendation performance.",

    "abstract": "Millions of stray animals suffer on the streets or are euthanized in shelters\nevery day around the world. In order to better adopt stray animals, scoring the\npawpularity (cuteness) of stray animals is very important, but evaluating the\npawpularity of animals is a very labor-intensive thing. Consequently, there has\nbeen an urgent surge of interest to develop an algorithm that scores\npawpularity of animals. However, the dataset in Kaggle not only has images, but\nalso metadata describing images. Most methods basically focus on the most\nadvanced image regression methods in recent years, but there is no good method\nto deal with the metadata of images. To address the above challenges, the paper\nproposes an image regression model called PETS-SWINF that considers metadata of\nthe images. Our results based on a dataset of Kaggle competition,\n\"PetFinder.my\", show that PETS-SWINF has an advantage over only based images\nmodels. Our results shows that the RMSE loss of the proposed model on the test\ndataset is 17.71876 but 17.76449 without metadata. The advantage of the\nproposed method is that PETS-SWINF can consider both low-order and high-order\nfeatures of metadata, and adaptively adjust the weights of the image model and\nthe metadata model. The performance is promising as our leadboard score is\nranked 15 out of 3545 teams (Gold medal) currently for 2021 Kaggle competition\non the challenge \"PetFinder.my\".",

    "abstract": "Due to diverse architectures in deep neural networks (DNNs) with severe\noverparameterization, regularization techniques are critical for finding\noptimal solutions in the huge hypothesis space. In this paper, we propose an\neffective regularization technique, called Neighborhood Region Smoothing (NRS).\nNRS leverages the finding that models would benefit from converging to flat\nminima, and tries to regularize the neighborhood region in weight space to\nyield approximate outputs. Specifically, gap between outputs of models in the\nneighborhood region is gauged by a defined metric based on Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence. This metric provides similar insights with the minimum description\nlength principle on interpreting flat minima. By minimizing both this\ndivergence and empirical loss, NRS could explicitly drive the optimizer towards\nconverging to flat minima. We confirm the effectiveness of NRS by performing\nimage classification tasks across a wide range of model architectures on\ncommonly-used datasets such as CIFAR and ImageNet, where generalization ability\ncould be universally improved. Also, we empirically show that the minima found\nby NRS would have relatively smaller Hessian eigenvalues compared to the\nconventional method, which is considered as the evidence of flat minima.",

    "abstract": "Most researchers have tried to enhance the robustness of deep neural networks\n(DNNs) by revealing and repairing the vulnerability of DNNs with specialized\nadversarial examples. Parts of the attack examples have imperceptible\nperturbations restricted by Lp norm. However, due to their high-frequency\nproperty, the adversarial examples usually have poor transferability and can be\ndefensed by denoising methods. To avoid the defects, some works make the\nperturbations unrestricted to gain better robustness and transferability.\nHowever, these examples usually look unnatural and alert the guards. To\ngenerate unrestricted adversarial examples with high image quality and good\ntransferability, in this paper, we propose Adversarial Lightness Attack (ALA),\na white-box unrestricted adversarial attack that focuses on modifying the\nlightness of the images. The shape and color of the samples, which are crucial\nto human perception, are barely influenced. To obtain adversarial examples with\nhigh image quality, we craft a naturalness-aware regularization. To achieve\nstronger transferability, we propose random initialization and non-stop attack\nstrategy in the attack procedure. We verify the effectiveness of ALA on two\npopular datasets for different tasks (i.e., ImageNet for image classification\nand Places-365 for scene recognition). The experiments show that the generated\nadversarial examples have both strong transferability and high image quality.\nBesides, the adversarial examples can also help to improve the standard trained\nResNet50 on defending lightness corruption.",

    "abstract": "This work studies a dynamic mechanism design problem in which a principal\ndelegates decision makings to a group of privately-informed agents without the\nmonetary transfer or burning. We consider that the principal privately\npossesses complete knowledge about the state transitions and study how she can\nuse her private observation to support the incentive compatibility of the\ndelegation via informational burning, a process we refer to as the\nlooking-forward persuasion. The delegation mechanism is formulated in which the\nagents form belief hierarchies due to the persuasion and play a dynamic\nBayesian game. We propose a novel randomized mechanism, known as Bayesian\npromised delegation (BPD), in which the periodic incentive compatibility is\nguaranteed by persuasions and promises of future delegations. We show that the\nBPD can achieve the same optimal social welfare as the original mechanism in\nstationary Markov perfect Bayesian equilibria. A revelation-principle-like\ndesign regime is established to show that the persuasion with belief\nhierarchies can be fully characterized by correlating the randomization of the\nagents' local BPD mechanisms with the persuasion as a direct recommendation of\nthe future promises.",

    "abstract": "5G networks provide higher flexibility and improved performance compared to\nprevious cellular technologies. This has raised expectations on the possibility\nto support advanced V2X services using the cellular network via\nVehicle-to-Network (V2N) and V2N2V connections. Most existing studies focus on\nevaluating the performance and feasibility of the 5G radio access network to\nsupport advanced V2X services. The network deployment and dimensioning also\nhave a strong impact on the end-to-end (E2E) performance, and hence on the\nsuitability of V2N and V2N2V connections to support advanced V2X services. This\nis specially the case for the E2E latency that is a critical requirement of V2X\nservices. This paper introduces a novel E2E latency model for 5G V2N/V2N2V\ncommunications. The model includes the latency introduced at the radio,\ntransport, core, Internet, peering points and application server (AS) for\nsingle mobile network operator (MNO) and multi-MNO scenarios. This paper\nestimates the E2E latency for a large variety of possible 5G network\ndeployments that are being discussed or envisioned to support V2X services.\nThis includes the possibility to deploy the V2X AS from the edge of the network\nto the cloud. The model is utilized to analyze the impact of different 5G\nnetwork deployments and configurations on the E2E latency. The analysis helps\nidentify which 5G network deployments and configurations are more suitable to\nmeet V2X latency requirements. The conducted analysis highlights the challenge\nfor centralized network deployments that locate the V2X AS at the cloud to meet\nthe latency requirements of advanced V2X services. Locating the V2X AS closer\nto the cell edge reduces the latency, but requires a higher number of ASs and\nalso careful dimensioning of the network and its configuration to ensure\nsufficient network and V2X AS resources are dedicated to serve the V2X traffic.",

    "abstract": "5G has been designed to support applications such as connected and automated\ndriving. To this aim, 5G includes a highly flexible New Radio (NR) interface\nthat can be configured to utilize different subcarrier spacings (SCS), slot\ndurations, scheduling, and retransmissions mechanisms. This flexibility can be\nexploited to support advanced V2X services with strict latency and reliability\nrequirements using V2N2V (Vehicle-to-Network-to-Vehicles) communications\ninstead of direct or sidelink V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle). To analyze this\npossibility, this paper presents a novel analytical model that estimates the\nlatency of 5G at the radio network level. The model accounts for the use of\ndifferent numerologies (SCS, slot durations and Cyclic Prefixes), modulation\nand coding schemes, full-slots or mini-slots, semi-static and dynamic\nscheduling, different retransmission mechanisms, and broadcast/multicast or\nunicast transmissions. The model has been used to first analyze the impact of\ndifferent 5G NR radio configurations on the latency. We then identify which\nradio configurations and scenarios can 5G NR satisfy the latency and\nreliability requirements of V2X services using V2N2V communications. This paper\nconsiders cooperative lane changes as a case study. The results show that 5G\ncan support advanced V2X services at the radio network level using V2N2V\ncommunications under certain conditions that depend on the radio configuration,\nbandwidth, service requirements and cell traffic load.",

These weights are able to\nreflect different importance of vertices within a hyperedge, thus leading to\nbetter characterized cut properties. More precisely, we introduce a new class\nof hyperedge splitting functions that we call EDVWs-based, where the penalty of\nsplitting a hyperedge depends only on the sum of EDVWs associated with the\nvertices on each side of the split. Moreover, we provide a way to construct\nsubmodular EDVWs-based splitting functions and prove that a hypergraph equipped\nwith such splitting functions can be reduced to a graph sharing the same cut\nproperties. In this case, the hypergraph minimum s-t cut problem can be solved\nusing well-developed solutions to the graph minimum s-t cut problem. In\naddition, we show that an existing sparsification technique can be easily\nextended to our case and makes the reduced graph smaller and sparser, thus\nfurther accelerating the algorithms applied to the reduced graph. Numerical\nexperiments using real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nEDVWs-based splitting functions in comparison with the all-or-nothing splitting\nfunction and cardinality-based splitting functions commonly adopted in existing\nwork.",

    "abstract": "Physics-Infused Machine Learning (PIML) architectures aim at integrating\nmachine learning with computationally-efficient, low-fidelity (partial) physics\nmodels, leading to improved generalizability, extrapolability, and robustness\nto noise, compared to pure data-driven approximation models. Recently a new\nPIML architecture was reported by the same authors, known as Opportunistic\nPhysics-mining Transfer Mapping Architecture or OPTMA, which transfers the\noriginal inputs into latent features using a transfer neural network; the\npartial physics model then uses the latent features to generate the final\noutput that is as close as possible to the high-fidelity output. While\ngradient-free solvers and back-propagation with supervised learning was earlier\nused to train OPTMA, that approach is computationally inefficient and\nchallenging to generalize across different problems or popular ML\nimplementations. This paper aims to alleviate these issues by infusing the\npartial physics model inside the neural network, as described via tensors in\nthe popular ML framework, PyTorch. Such a description also naturally allows\nauto-differentiation (AD) of the partial physics model, thereby enabling the\nuse of efficient back-propagation methods to train the transfer network. The\nbenefits of the upgraded OPTMA architecture with AD (OPTMA-Net) is demonstrated\nby applying it to the problem of modeling the sound pressure field created by a\nhovering unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Ground truth data for this problem was\nobtained from an indoor UAV noise measurement setup. Here, the partial physics\nmodel is based on the interference of acoustic pressure waves generated by an\narbitrary number of acoustic monopole sources. Case studies show that OPTMA-Net\nprovides generalization performance close to, and extrapolation performance\nthat is 4 times better than, those given by a pure data-driven model.",

Experiments on humans have demonstrated that the auditory system\ncan identify sound sources as repeating patterns embedded in the acoustic\ninput. Source repetition produces temporal regularities that can be detected\nand used for segregation. Specifically, listeners can identify sounds occurring\nmore than once across different mixtures, but not sounds heard only in a single\nmixture. However, whether such a behaviour can be computationally modelled has\nnot yet been explored. Here, we propose a biologically inspired computational\nmodel to perform blind source separation on sequences of mixtures of acoustic\nstimuli. Our method relies on a somatodendritic neuron model trained with a\nHebbian-like learning rule which can detect spatio-temporal patterns recurring\nin synaptic inputs. We show that the segregation capabilities of our model are\nreminiscent of the features of human performance in a variety of experimental\nsettings involving synthesized sounds with naturalistic properties.\nFurthermore, we extend the study to investigate the properties of segregation\non task settings not yet explored with human subjects, namely natural sounds\nand images. Overall, our work suggests that somatodendritic neuron models offer\na promising neuro-inspired learning strategy to account for the characteristics\nof the brain segregation capabilities as well as to make predictions on yet\nuntested experimental settings.",

    "abstract": "Temporal information extraction plays a critical role in natural language\nunderstanding. Previous systems have incorporated advanced neural language\nmodels and have successfully enhanced the accuracy of temporal information\nextraction tasks. However, these systems have two major shortcomings. First,\nthey fail to make use of the two-sided nature of temporal relations in\nprediction. Second, they involve non-parallelizable pipelines in inference\nprocess that bring little performance gain. To this end, we propose a novel\ntemporal information extraction model based on deep biaffine attention to\nextract temporal relationships between events in unstructured text efficiently\nand accurately. Our model is performant because we perform relation extraction\ntasks directly instead of considering event annotation as a prerequisite of\nrelation extraction. Moreover, our architecture uses Multilayer Perceptrons\n(MLP) with biaffine attention to predict arcs and relation labels separately,\nimproving relation detecting accuracy by exploiting the two-sided nature of\ntemporal relationships. We experimentally demonstrate that our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in temporal relation extraction.",

To this end, overparameterization has been the subject of\nimmense interest to explain the generalization ability of deep nets even when\nthe size of the dataset is smaller than that of the model. While the prior\nliterature focuses on the classical supervised setting, this paper aims to\ndemystify overparameterization for meta-learning.

This work shows that\nsurprisingly, overparameterization arises as a natural answer to these\nfundamental meta-learning questions. Specifically, for (1), we first show that\nlearning the optimal representation coincides with the problem of designing a\ntask-aware regularization to promote inductive bias. We leverage this inductive\nbias to explain how the downstream task actually benefits from\noverparameterization, in contrast to prior works on few-shot learning. For (2),\nwe develop a theory to explain how feature covariance can implicitly help\nreduce the sample complexity well below the degrees of freedom and lead to\nsmall estimation error.

On the other hand, adapting Data Centers' operational management\nto the occurrence of sporadic anomalies is complicated due to the reduced\nfrequency of failures in the system. Therefore, we also propose a methodology\nto increase the generated data variability by introducing on-demand anomalies.\nWe validated our approach using real data collected from an operating Data\nCenter, successfully obtaining forecasts of random scenarios with several hours\nof prediction.

    "abstract": "Decision-making for autonomous driving is challenging, considering the\ncomplex interactions among multiple traffic agents (e.g., autonomous vehicles\n(AVs), human drivers, and pedestrians) and the computational load needed to\nevaluate these interactions. This paper develops two general potential game\nbased frameworks, namely, finite and continuous potential games, for\ndecision-making in autonomous driving. The two frameworks account for the AVs'\ntwo types of action spaces, i.e., finite and continuous action spaces,\nrespectively. We show that the developed frameworks provide theoretical\nguarantees, including 1) existence of pure-strategy Nash equilibria, 2)\nconvergence of the Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking algorithms, and 3) global\noptimality of the derived NE (in the sense that both self- and team- interests\nare optimized). In addition, we provide cost function shaping approaches to\nconstructing multi-agent potential games in autonomous driving. Moreover, two\nsolution algorithms, including self-play dynamics (e.g., best response\ndynamics) and potential function optimization, are developed for each game. The\ndeveloped frameworks are then applied to two different traffic scenarios,\nincluding intersection-crossing and lane-changing in highways. Statistical\ncomparative studies, including 1) finite potential game vs. continuous\npotential game, and 2) best response dynamics vs. potential function\noptimization, are conducted to compare the performances of different solution\nalgorithms. It is shown that both developed frameworks are practical (i.e.,\ncomputationally efficient), reliable (i.e., resulting in satisfying driving\nperformances in diverse scenarios and situations), and robust (i.e., resulting\nin satisfying driving performances against uncertain behaviors of the\nsurrounding vehicles) for real-time decision-making in autonomous driving.",

Specifically, a saliency detection\nalgorithm based on a novel attention model is proposed for identifying\nsubsurface structures within seismic data volumes. The algorithm employs 3D-FFT\nand a multi-dimensional spectral projection, which decomposes local spectra\ninto three distinct components, each depicting variations along different\ndimensions of the data. Subsequently, a novel directional center-surround\nattention model is proposed to incorporate directional comparisons around each\nvoxel for saliency detection within each projected dimension. Next, the\nresulting saliency maps along each dimension are combined adaptively to yield a\nconsolidated saliency map, which highlights various structures characterized by\nsubtle variations and relative motion with respect to their neighboring\nsections. A priori information about the seismic data can be either embedded\ninto the proposed attention model in the directional comparisons, or\nincorporated into the algorithm by specifying a template when combining\nsaliency maps adaptively. Experimental results on two real seismic datasets\nfrom the North Sea, Netherlands and Great South Basin, New Zealand demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for detecting salient seismic\nstructures of different natures and appearances in one shot, which differs\nsignificantly from traditional seismic interpretation algorithms.

However, majority of the research on AEs\nis in the digital domain and the adversarial patches are static, which is very\ndifferent from many real-world DNN applications such as Traffic Sign\nRecognition (TSR) systems in autonomous vehicles. In TSR systems, object\ndetectors use DNNs to process streaming video in real time. From the view of\nobject detectors, the traffic sign`s position and quality of the video are\ncontinuously changing, rendering the digital AEs ineffective in the physical\nworld.\nIn this paper, we propose a systematic pipeline to generate robust physical\nAEs against real-world object detectors. Robustness is achieved in three ways.\nFirst, we simulate the in-vehicle cameras by extending the distribution of\nimage transformations with the blur transformation and the resolution\ntransformation. Second, we design the single and multiple bounding boxes\nfilters to improve the efficiency of the perturbation training. Third, we\nconsider four representative attack vectors, namely Hiding Attack, Appearance\nAttack, Non-Target Attack and Target Attack.\nWe perform a comprehensive set of experiments under a variety of\nenvironmental conditions, and considering illuminations in sunny and cloudy\nweather as well as at night. The experimental results show that the physical\nAEs generated from our pipeline are effective and robust when attacking the\nYOLO v5 based TSR system. The attacks have good transferability and can deceive\nother state-of-the-art object detectors. We launched HA and NTA on a brand-new\n2021 model vehicle. Both attacks are successful in fooling the TSR system,\nwhich could be a life-threatening case for autonomous vehicles. Finally, we\ndiscuss three defense mechanisms based on image preprocessing, AEs detection,\nand model enhancing.",

QE models for GEC evaluations in prior work have obtained a high\ncorrelation with manual evaluations.

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks have been widely studied to hide the misclassification rules\nin the normal models, which are only activated when the model is aware of the\nspecific inputs (i.e., the trigger). However, despite their success in the\nconventional Euclidean space, there are few studies of backdoor attacks on\ngraph structured data. In this paper, we propose a new type of backdoor which\nis specific to graph data, called neighboring backdoor. Considering the\ndiscreteness of graph data, how to effectively design the triggers while\nretaining the model accuracy on the original task is the major challenge. To\naddress such a challenge, we set the trigger as a single node, and the backdoor\nis activated when the trigger node is connected to the target node. To preserve\nthe model accuracy, the model parameters are not allowed to be modified. Thus,\nwhen the trigger node is not connected, the model performs normally. Under\nthese settings, in this work, we focus on generating the features of the\ntrigger node. Two types of backdoors are proposed: (1) Linear Graph Convolution\nBackdoor which finds an approximation solution for the feature generation (can\nbe viewed as an integer programming problem) by looking at the linear part of\nGCNs. (2) Variants of existing graph attacks. We extend current gradient-based\nattack methods to our backdoor attack scenario. Extensive experiments on two\nsocial networks and two citation networks datasets demonstrate that all\nproposed backdoors can achieve an almost 100\\% attack success rate while having\nno impact on predictive accuracy.",

In the\nconsidered system, the original message at the transmitter is first divided\ninto two parts: (i) active transmit message and (ii) backscatter message. Then,\nthe active transmit message is transmitted by using the conventional wireless\ntransmission method while the backscatter message is transmitted by\nbackscattering the active transmit signals via an ambient backscatter tag. As\nthe backscatter tag does not generate any active signals, it is intractable for\nthe adversary to detect the backscatter message.

Most solutions in EC employ machine learning (ML) methods to\nperform data classification and other information processing tasks on\ncontinuous and evolving data streams. Usually, such solutions have to cope with\nvast amounts of data that come as data streams while balancing energy\nconsumption, latency, and the predictive performance of the algorithms.\nEnsemble methods achieve remarkable predictive performance when applied to\nevolving data streams due to the combination of several models and the\npossibility of selective resets. This work investigates strategies for\noptimizing the performance (i.e., delay, throughput) and energy consumption of\nbagging ensembles to classify data streams. The experimental evaluation\ninvolved six state-of-art ensemble algorithms (OzaBag, OzaBag Adaptive Size\nHoeffding Tree, Online Bagging ADWIN, Leveraging Bagging, Adaptive\nRandomForest, and Streaming Random Patches) applying five widely used machine\nlearning benchmark datasets with varied characteristics on three computer\nplatforms.

Recently, learning to branch has become a hot research\ntopic in the intersection of machine learning and combinatorial optimization.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based B\\&B algorithm.\nSimilar to offline reinforcement learning, we initially train on the\ndemonstration data to accelerate learning massively. With the improvement of\nthe training effect, the agent starts to interact with the environment with its\nlearned policy gradually.

In order to improve the robustness of the\ntraining process, a superior network is additionally introduced based on Double\nDQN, which always serves as a Q-network with competitive performance. We\nevaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm over three public research\nbenchmarks and compare it against strong baselines, including three classical\nheuristics and one state-of-the-art imitation learning-based branching\nalgorithm.

To explore this, we first\nintroduce the notion of training plasticity to quantify the training progress\nof internal DNN layers.

    "abstract": "Cooperative repair model is an available technology to deal with multiple\nnode failures in distributed storage systems. Recently, explicit constructions\nof cooperative MSR codes were given by Ye (IEEE Transactions on Information\nTheory, 2020) with sub-packetization level $(d-k+h)(d-k+1)^n$. Specifically,\nthe sub-packetization level is $(h+1)2^n$ when $d=k+1$. In this paper, we\npropose a new cooperative repair scheme by means of the inter-instance and\nintra-instance pairing inherited from the perfect code which reduces the\nsub-packetization to $2^n$ when $(h+1)|2^n$ and $(2\\ell+1)2^n$ when\n$h+1=(2\\ell+1)2^m$ for $m\\ge 0$, $\\ell\\ge 1$ with $d=k+1$ helper nodes. That is\nto say, the sub-packetization is $h + 1 $ times or $2^m$ times less than Ye's.\nIt turned out to be the best result so far known.",

There is hence\na strong need to regulate the usage of mobile sensors so as to keep them from\nbeing exploited by malicious attackers. However, despite the fact that various\nefforts have been put in achieving this, i.e., detecting privacy leaks in\nAndroid apps, we have not yet found approaches to automatically detect sensor\nleaks in Android apps. To fill the gap, we designed and implemented a novel\nprototype tool, SEEKER, that extends the famous FlowDroid tool to detect\nsensor-based data leaks in Android apps. SEEKER conducts sensor-focused static\ntaint analyses directly on the Android apps' bytecode and reports not only\nsensor-triggered privacy leaks but also the sensor types involved in the leaks.\nExperimental results using over 40,000 real-world Android apps show that SEEKER\nis effective in detecting sensor leaks in Android apps, and malicious apps are\nmore interested in leaking sensor data than benign apps.",

As a\nresult, the information of confident pseudo-labels can be effectively\npropagated into more unlabeled samples during training by the well-clustered\nfeatures.

However, if eavesdroppers reside in the beam sector, the directivity\nfails to work effectively to handle this range-domain security problem. More\ncritically, with an eavesdropper inside the beam sector and nearer to the\ntransmitter than the legitimate receiver, i.e., in close proximity, secure\ncommunication is jeopardized. This open challenge motivates this work to study\nPLS techniques to enhance THz range-angle security. In this paper, a novel\nwidely-spaced array and beamforming (WASABI) design for THz range-angle secure\ncommunication is proposed, based on the uniform planar array and hybrid\nbeamforming. Specifically, the WASABI design is theoretically proved to achieve\nthe optimal secrecy rate powered by the non-constrained optimum approaching\n(NCOA) algorithm with more than one RF chain, i.e., with the hybrid beamforming\nscheme. Moreover, with a low-complexity and sub-optimal analog beamforming, the\nWASABI scheme can achieve sub-optimal performance with less than 5% secrecy\nrate degradation. Simulation results illustrate that our proposed widely-spaced\nantenna communication scheme can ensure a 6bps/Hz secrecy rate when the\ntransmit power is 10dBm.

Albeit\nmoderate improvements in current approaches, they commonly require high-quality\nhomologous data sources of videos and audios, thus causing the failure to\nleverage heterogeneous data sufficiently. In practice, it may be intractable to\ncollect the perfect homologous data in some cases, for example, audio-corrupted\nor picture-blurry videos. To explore this kind of data and support\nhigh-fidelity few-shot visual dubbing, in this paper, we novelly propose a\nsimple yet efficient two-stage framework with a higher flexibility of mining\nheterogeneous data. Specifically, our two-stage paradigm employs facial\nlandmarks as intermediate prior of latent representations and disentangles the\nlip movements prediction from the core task of realistic talking head\ngeneration. By this means, our method makes it possible to independently\nutilize the training corpus for two-stage sub-networks using more available\nheterogeneous data easily acquired. Besides, thanks to the disentanglement, our\nframework allows a further fine-tuning for a given talking head, thereby\nleading to better speaker-identity preserving in the final synthesized results.\nMoreover, the proposed method can also transfer appearance features from others\nto the target speaker.

Importantly, our modification is purely to the order of\ncomputations, while the produced outputs and learned weights are identical to\nthose of the original Multi-Head Attention. To validate our approach, we\nconduct experiments on visual, audio, and audio-visual classification and\ndetection tasks, i.e. Online Action Detection on THUMOS14 and TVSeries and\nOnline Audio Classification on GTZAN, with remarkable results. Our continual\none-block transformers reduce the floating point operations by respectively\n63.5x and 51.5x in the Online Action Detection and Audio Classification\nexperiments at similar predictive performance.",

    "abstract": "Gridworlds have been long-utilised in AI research, particularly in\nreinforcement learning, as they provide simple yet scalable models for many\nreal-world applications such as robot navigation, emergent behaviour, and\noperations research. We initiate a study of gridworlds using the mathematical\nframework of reconfigurable systems and state complexes due to Abrams, Ghrist &\nPeterson. State complexes represent all possible configurations of a system as\na single geometric space, thus making them conducive to study using geometric,\ntopological, or combinatorial methods. The main contribution of this work is a\nmodification to the original Abrams, Ghrist & Peterson setup which we believe\nis more naturally-suited to the context of gridworlds. With this modification,\nthe state complexes may exhibit geometric defects (failure of Gromov's Link\nCondition), however, we argue that these failures can indicate undesirable or\ndangerous states in the gridworld. Our results provide a novel method for\nseeking guaranteed safety limitations in discrete task environments with single\nor multiple agents, and offer potentially useful geometric and topological\ninformation for incorporation in or analysis of machine learning systems.",

However, the conventional fully digital precoding\narchitectures might lead to high implementation complexity and energy\nconsumption. In this paper, hybrid analog/digital precoding solutions are\ndeveloped for the downlink operation in LEO massive MIMO satellite\ncommunications, by exploiting the slow-varying statistical channel state\ninformation (CSI) at the transmitter. First, we formulate the hybrid precoder\ndesign as an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem by considering both\nthe continuous and discrete phase shift networks for implementing the analog\nprecoder. The cases of both the fully and the partially connected architectures\nare considered. Since the EE optimization problem is nonconvex, it is in\ngeneral difficult to solve. To make the EE maximization problem tractable, we\napply a closed-form tight upper bound to approximate the ergodic rate. Then, we\ndevelop an efficient algorithm to obtain the fully digital precoders. Based on\nwhich, we further develop two different efficient algorithmic solutions to\ncompute the hybrid precoders for the fully and the partially connected\narchitectures, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed\napproaches achieve significant EE performance gains over the existing\nbaselines, especially when the discrete phase shift network is employed for\nanalog precoding.",

    "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) is widely regarded as crucial challenge for lifelong\nAI. However, existing CL benchmarks, e.g. Permuted-MNIST and Split-CIFAR, make\nuse of artificial temporal variation and do not align with or generalize to the\nreal-world. In this paper, we introduce CLEAR, the first continual image\nclassification benchmark dataset with a natural temporal evolution of visual\nconcepts in the real world that spans a decade (2004-2014). We build CLEAR from\nexisting large-scale image collections (YFCC100M) through a novel and scalable\nlow-cost approach to visio-linguistic dataset curation. Our pipeline makes use\nof pretrained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) to interactively build labeled\ndatasets, which are further validated with crowd-sourcing to remove errors and\neven inappropriate images (hidden in original YFCC100M). The major strength of\nCLEAR over prior CL benchmarks is the smooth temporal evolution of visual\nconcepts with real-world imagery, including both high-quality labeled data\nalong with abundant unlabeled samples per time period for continual\nsemi-supervised learning. We find that a simple unsupervised pre-training step\ncan already boost state-of-the-art CL algorithms that only utilize\nfully-supervised data. Our analysis also reveals that mainstream CL evaluation\nprotocols that train and test on iid data artificially inflate performance of\nCL system. To address this, we propose novel \"streaming\" protocols for CL that\nalways test on the (near) future. Interestingly, streaming protocols (a) can\nsimplify dataset curation since today's testset can be repurposed for\ntomorrow's trainset and (b) can produce more generalizable models with more\naccurate estimates of performance since all labeled data from each time-period\nis used for both training and testing (unlike classic iid train-test splits).",

The optimal\ncomputation-communication tradeoff has been well studied for homogeneous\nsystems, and some results have also been obtained under the heterogeneous\ncondition in recent studies. However, the previous works allow the file\nplacement and Reduce function assignment free to design for the scheme. In this\npaper, we consider the general heterogeneous MapReduce system, where the file\nplacement and Reduce function assignment are arbitrary but prefixed among all\nnodes (i.e., can not be designed by the scheme), and the storage and the\ncomputational capabilities for different nodes are not necessarily equal. We\npropose two {universal} CDC schemes and establish upper bounds of the optimal\ncommunication load. The first achievable scheme, namely One-Shot Coded\nTransmission (OSCT), encodes the intermediate values (IVs) into message blocks\nwith different sizes to exploit the multicasting gain, and each message block\ncan be decoded independently by the intended nodes. The second scheme, namely\nFew-Shot Coded Transmission (FSCT), splits IVs into smaller pieces and each\nnode jointly decodes multiple message blocks to obtain its desired IVs. We\nprove that our OSCT and FSCT are optimal in many cases, and give sufficient\nconditions for the optimality of OSCT and FSCT, respectively.",

    "title": "Action Keypoint Network for Efficient Video Recognition",
    "abstract": "Reducing redundancy is crucial for improving the efficiency of video\nrecognition models. An effective approach is to select informative content from\nthe holistic video, yielding a popular family of dynamic video recognition\nmethods. However, existing dynamic methods focus on either temporal or spatial\nselection independently while neglecting a reality that the redundancies are\nusually spatial and temporal, simultaneously. Moreover, their selected content\nis usually cropped with fixed shapes, while the realistic distribution of\ninformative content can be much more diverse. With these two insights, this\npaper proposes to integrate temporal and spatial selection into an Action\nKeypoint Network (AK-Net). From different frames and positions, AK-Net selects\nsome informative points scattered in arbitrary-shaped regions as a set of\naction keypoints and then transforms the video recognition into point cloud\nclassification. AK-Net has two steps, i.e., the keypoint selection and the\npoint cloud classification. First, it inputs the video into a baseline network\nand outputs a feature map from an intermediate layer. We view each pixel on\nthis feature map as a spatial-temporal point and select some informative\nkeypoints using self-attention. Second, AK-Net devises a ranking criterion to\narrange the keypoints into an ordered 1D sequence. Consequentially, AK-Net\nbrings two-fold benefits for efficiency: The keypoint selection step collects\ninformative content within arbitrary shapes and increases the efficiency for\nmodeling spatial-temporal dependencies, while the point cloud classification\nstep further reduces the computational cost by compacting the convolutional\nkernels. Experimental results show that AK-Net can consistently improve the\nefficiency and performance of baseline methods on several video recognition\nbenchmarks.",

Furthermore, cameras are usually treated by pairs, obtaining\nlocal solutions, rather than finding a global solution at once. Other key issue\nis that of the affinity measurement: the widespread usage of non-learnable\npre-defined distances, such as the Euclidean and Cosine ones. This paper\nproposes an efficient approach for cross-cameras data-association focused on a\nglobal solution, instead of processing cameras by pairs. To avoid the usage of\nfixed distances, we leverage the connectivity of Graph Neural Networks,\npreviously unused in this scope, using a Message Passing Network to jointly\nlearn features and similarity. We validate the proposal for pedestrian\nmulti-view association, showing results over the EPFL multi-camera pedestrian\ndataset.

    "abstract": "Human infants learn language while interacting with their environment in\nwhich their caregivers may describe the objects and actions they perform.\nSimilar to human infants, artificial agents can learn language while\ninteracting with their environment. In this work, first, we present a neural\nmodel that bidirectionally binds robot actions and their language descriptions\nin a simple object manipulation scenario. Building on our previous Paired\nVariational Autoencoders (PVAE) model, we demonstrate the superiority of the\nvariational autoencoder over standard autoencoders by experimenting with cubes\nof different colours, and by enabling the production of alternative\nvocabularies. Additional experiments show that the model's channel-separated\nvisual feature extraction module can cope with objects of different shapes.\nNext, we introduce PVAE-BERT, which equips the model with a pretrained\nlarge-scale language model, i.e., Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers (BERT), enabling the model to go beyond comprehending only the\npredefined descriptions that the network has been trained on; the recognition\nof action descriptions generalises to unconstrained natural language as the\nmodel becomes capable of understanding unlimited variations of the same\ndescriptions. Our experiments suggest that using a pretrained language model as\nthe language encoder allows our approach to scale up for real-world scenarios\nwith instructions from human users.",

It\nattempts at describing why a search strategy might be successful, struggle or\nfail on a target task. Our study leverages this methodology in the context of\nsearching across sensors, including sensor data fusion.

From the perspective of\ndistributions of fitness, our findings indicate a similar behaviour of the\nsearch space for all sensors: the longer the training time, the larger the\noverall fitness, and more flatness in the landscapes (less ruggedness and\ndeviation). Regarding sensors, the better the fitness they enable (Sentinel-2),\nthe better the search trajectories (smoother, higher persistence). Results also\nindicate very similar search behaviour for sensors that can be decently fitted\nby the search space (Sentinel-2 and fusion).",

    "abstract": "Dynamic techniques are a scalable and effective way to analyze concurrent\nprograms. Instead of analyzing all behaviors of a program, these techniques\ndetect errors by focusing on a single program execution. Often a crucial step\nin these techniques is to define a causal ordering between events in the\nexecution, which is then computed using vector clocks, a simple data structure\nthat stores logical times of threads. The two basic operations of vector\nclocks, namely join and copy, require $\\Theta(k)$ time, where $k$ is the number\nof threads. Thus they are a computational bottleneck when $k$ is large.\nIn this work, we introduce tree clocks, a new data structure that replaces\nvector clocks for computing causal orderings in program executions. Joining and\ncopying tree clocks takes time that is roughly proportional to the number of\nentries being modified, and hence the two operations do not suffer the a-priori\n$\\Theta(k)$ cost per application. We show that when used to compute the classic\nhappens-before (HB) partial order, tree clocks are optimal, in the sense that\nno other data structure can lead to smaller asymptotic running time. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate that tree clocks can be used to compute other partial orders,\nsuch as schedulable-happens-before (SHB) and the standard Mazurkiewicz (MAZ)\npartial order, and thus are a versatile data structure. Our experiments show\nthat just by replacing vector clocks with tree clocks, the computation becomes\nfrom $2.02 \\times$ faster (MAZ) to $2.66 \\times$ (SHB) and $2.97 \\times$ (HB)\non average per benchmark. These results illustrate that tree clocks have the\npotential to become a standard data structure with wide applications in\nconcurrent analyses.",

    "abstract": "Today's radio access networks (RANs) are monolithic entities which often\noperate statically on a given set of parameters for the entirety of their\noperations. To implement realistic and effective spectrum sharing policies,\nRANs will need to seamlessly and intelligently change their operational\nparameters. In stark contrast with existing paradigms, the new O-RAN\narchitectures for 5G-and-beyond networks (NextG) separate the logic that\ncontrols the RAN from its hardware substrate, allowing unprecedented real-time\nfine-grained control of RAN components. In this context, we propose the\nChannel-Aware Reactive Mechanism (ChARM), a data-driven O-RAN-compliant\nframework that allows (i) sensing the spectrum to infer the presence of\ninterference and (ii) reacting in real time by switching the distributed unit\n(DU) and radio unit (RU) operational parameters according to a specified\nspectrum access policy. ChARM is based on neural networks operating directly on\nunprocessed I/Q waveforms to determine the current spectrum context. ChARM does\nnot require any modification to the existing 3GPP standards. It is designed to\noperate within the O-RAN specifications, and can be used in conjunction with\nother spectrum sharing mechanisms (e.g., LTE-U, LTE-LAA or MulteFire). We\ndemonstrate the performance of ChARM in the context of spectrum sharing among\nLTE and Wi-Fi in unlicensed bands, where a controller operating over a RAN\nIntelligent Controller (RIC) senses the spectrum and switches cell frequency to\navoid Wi-Fi. We develop a prototype of ChARM using srsRAN, and leverage the\nColosseum channel emulator to collect a large-scale waveform dataset to train\nour neural networks with. Experimental results show that ChARM achieves\naccuracy of up to 96% on Colosseum and 85% on an over-the-air testbed,\ndemonstrating the capacity of ChARM to exploit the considered spectrum\nchannels.",

    "abstract": "The CAN Bus is crucial to the efficiency, and safety of modern vehicle\ninfrastructure. Electronic Control Units (ECUs) exchange data across a shared\nbus, dropping messages whenever errors occur. If an ECU generates enough\nerrors, their transmitter is put in a bus-off state, turning it off. Previous\nwork abuses this process to disable ECUs, but is trivial to detect through the\nmultiple errors transmitted over the bus. We propose a novel attack,\nundetectable by prior intrusion detection systems, which disables ECUs within a\nsingle message without generating any errors on the bus. Performing this attack\nrequires the ability to flip bits on the bus, but not with any level of\nsophistication. We show that an attacker who can only flip bits 40% of the time\ncan execute our stealthy attack 100% of the time. But this attack, and all\nprior CAN attacks, rely on the ability to read the bus. We propose a new\ntechnique which synchronizes the bus, such that even a blind attacker,\nincapable of reading the bus, can know when to transmit. Taking a limited\nattacker's chance of success from the percentage of dead bus time, to 100%.\nFinally, we propose a small modification to the CAN error process to ensure an\nECU cannot fail without being detected, no matter how advanced the attacker is.\nTaken together we advance the state of the art for CAN attacks and blind\nattackers, while proposing a detection system against stealthy attacks, and the\nlarger problem of CAN's abusable error frames.",

In the\ncourse of this paper, we discuss the design of a graph schema and MBSE\nmodelling approach, enabling deep going system analysis and anomaly resolution\nin complex embedded systems. The schema and modelling approach are designed to\nanswer questions such as what happens if there is an electrical short in a\ncomponent?

    "abstract": "This paper presents a mobile supernumerary robotic approach to physical\nassistance in human-robot conjoined actions. The study starts with the\ndescription of the SUPER-MAN concept. The idea is to develop and utilize mobile\ncollaborative systems that can follow human loco-manipulation commands to\nperform industrial tasks through three main components: i) a physical\ninterface, ii) a human-robot interaction controller and iii) a supernumerary\nrobotic body. Next, we present two possible implementations within the\nframework - from theoretical and hardware perspectives. The first system is\ncalled MOCA-MAN, and is composed of a redundant torque-controlled robotic arm\nand an omni-directional mobile platform. The second one is called Kairos-MAN,\nformed by a high-payload 6-DoF velocity-controlled robotic arm and an\nomni-directional mobile platform. The systems share the same admittance\ninterface, through which user wrenches are translated to loco-manipulation\ncommands, generated by whole-body controllers of each system. Besides, a\nthorough user-study with multiple and cross-gender subjects is presented to\nreveal the quantitative performance of the two systems in effort demanding and\ndexterous tasks. Moreover, we provide qualitative results from the NASA-TLX\nquestionnaire to demonstrate the SUPER-MAN approach's potential and its\nacceptability from the users' viewpoint.",

    "title": "Towards Unsupervised Deep Graph Structure Learning",
    "abstract": "In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a successful\ntool in a variety of graph-related applications. However, the performance of\nGNNs can be deteriorated when noisy connections occur in the original graph\nstructures; besides, the dependence on explicit structures prevents GNNs from\nbeing applied to general unstructured scenarios. To address these issues,\nrecently emerged deep graph structure learning (GSL) methods propose to jointly\noptimize the graph structure along with GNN under the supervision of a node\nclassification task. Nonetheless, these methods focus on a supervised learning\nscenario, which leads to several problems, i.e., the reliance on labels, the\nbias of edge distribution, and the limitation on application tasks. In this\npaper, we propose a more practical GSL paradigm, unsupervised graph structure\nlearning, where the learned graph topology is optimized by data itself without\nany external guidance (i.e., labels). To solve the unsupervised GSL problem, we\npropose a novel StrUcture Bootstrapping contrastive LearnIng fraMEwork (SUBLIME\nfor abbreviation) with the aid of self-supervised contrastive learning.\nSpecifically, we generate a learning target from the original data as an\n\"anchor graph\", and use a contrastive loss to maximize the agreement between\nthe anchor graph and the learned graph. To provide persistent guidance, we\ndesign a novel bootstrapping mechanism that upgrades the anchor graph with\nlearned structures during model learning. We also design a series of graph\nlearners and post-processing schemes to model the structures to learn.\nExtensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant\neffectiveness of our proposed SUBLIME and high quality of the optimized graphs.",

Our use case\nare atomistic simulations carried out with the GROMACS molecular dynamics (MD)\ntoolkit with a focus on alchemical protein-ligand binding free energy\ncalculations.\nWe set up a compute cluster in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud that\nincorporates various different instances with Intel, AMD, and ARM CPUs, some\nwith GPU acceleration. Using representative biomolecular simulation systems we\nbenchmark how GROMACS performs on individual instances and across multiple\ninstances. Thereby we assess which instances deliver the highest performance\nand which are the most cost-efficient ones for our use case.\nWe find that, in terms of total costs including hardware, personnel, room,\nenergy and cooling, producing MD trajectories in the cloud can be as\ncost-efficient as an on-premises cluster given that optimal cloud instances are\nchosen. Further, we find that high-throughput ligand-screening for\nprotein-ligand binding affinity estimation can be accelerated dramatically by\nusing global cloud resources. For a ligand screening study consisting of 19,872\nindependent simulations, we used all hardware that was available in the cloud\nat the time of the study.

    "abstract": "Brushing is an everyday interaction in 2D scatterplots, which allows users to\nselect and filter data points within a continuous, enclosed region and conduct\nfurther analysis on the points. However, such conventional brushing cannot be\ndirectly applied to Multidimensional Projections (MDP), as they hardly escape\nfrom False and Missing Neighbors distortions that make the relative positions\nof the points unreliable. To alleviate this problem, we introduce\nDistortion-aware brushing, a novel brushing technique for MDP. While users\nperform brushing, Distortion-aware brushing resolves distortions around\ncurrently brushed points by dynamically relocating points in the projection;\nthe points whose data are close to the brushed data in the multidimensional\n(MD) space go near the corresponding brushed points in the projection, and the\nopposites move away. Hence, users can overcome distortions and readily extract\nout clustered data in the MD space using the technique. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness and applicability of Distortion-aware brushing through usage\nscenarios with two datasets. Finally, by conducting user studies with 30\nparticipants, we verified that Distortion-aware brushing significantly\noutperforms previous brushing techniques in precisely separating clusters in\nthe MD space, and works robustly regardless of the types or the amount of\ndistortions in MDP.",

    "abstract": "While the need for well-trained, fair ML systems is increasing ever more,\nmeasuring fairness for modern models and datasets is becoming increasingly\ndifficult as they grow at an unprecedented pace. One key challenge in scaling\ncommon fairness metrics to such models and datasets is the requirement of\nexhaustive ground truth labeling, which cannot always be done. Indeed, this\noften rules out the application of traditional analysis metrics and systems. At\nthe same time, ML-fairness assessments cannot be made algorithmically, as\nfairness is a highly subjective matter. Thus, domain experts need to be able to\nextract and reason about bias throughout models and datasets to make informed\ndecisions. While visual analysis tools are of great help when investigating\npotential bias in DL models, none of the existing approaches have been designed\nfor the specific tasks and challenges that arise in large label spaces.\nAddressing the lack of visualization work in this area, we propose guidelines\nfor designing visualizations for such large label spaces, considering both\ntechnical and ethical issues. Our proposed visualization approach can be\nintegrated into classical model and data pipelines, and we provide an\nimplementation of our techniques open-sourced as a TensorBoard plug-in.

In this paper, we propose an improved degree evaluation method and a\nsuperpoly recovery technique, both of which are important in the cube attack.\nThe algebraic degree of the cryptosystem could be not only used to judge\nwhether the superpoly is zero, but also used to search for good cube indices\nset, and the estimation of which has always been a topic of concern in\nalgebraic attacks. To improve accuracy of degree evaluation, we introduce the\nconcept of vector degree for a Boolean function and propose the vector numeric\nmapping technique which aims to describe the propagation of the vector degree.\nRecovering superpoly of the cube is the key step in the preprocessing phase of\ncube attack. Three-subset division property without unknown subset has been an\nefficient tool in recovering the exact superpoly by studying the division\ntrails. It is convenient to use off-the-shelf MILP solver to search all\ndivision trails by transforming the division property into a MILP model. But\nwhen there are too many division trails, it is difficult to find all solutions\nby a MILP solver. We propose a method to simplify this problem through\ncombining the algebraic representations of the middle-round states in the\niterative process of a cipher. Thanks to the introduction of some new variables\ninstead of complex expressions of key bits and elimination of some trails in\nthe middle round, the number of solutions for a MILP model will be greatly\nreduced. To verify the effectiveness of our methods, we apply them to the\nTrivium stream cipher. We find three cubes both of which have \\texttt{zero-sum}\ndistinguisher till $840$ rounds. We also put forward $843$ and $844$-round\nkey-recovery attacks against Trivium with time complexity at most 2^{79.2} and\n2^{79.4}, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In many board games and other abstract games, patterns have been used as\nfeatures that can guide automated game-playing agents. Such patterns or\nfeatures often represent particular configurations of pieces, empty positions,\netc., which may be relevant for a game's strategies. Their use has been\nparticularly prevalent in the game of Go, but also many other games used as\nbenchmarks for AI research. Simple, linear policies of such features are\nunlikely to produce state-of-the-art playing strength like the deep neural\nnetworks that have been more commonly used in recent years do. However, they\ntypically require significantly fewer resources to train, which is paramount\nfor large-scale studies of hundreds to thousands of distinct games. In this\npaper, we formulate a design and efficient implementation of spatial\nstate-action features for general games. These are patterns that can be trained\nto incentivise or disincentivise actions based on whether or not they match\nvariables of the state in a local area around action variables. We provide\nextensive details on several design and implementation choices, with a primary\nfocus on achieving a high degree of generality to support a wide variety of\ndifferent games using different board geometries or other graphs. Secondly, we\npropose an efficient approach for evaluating active features for any given set\nof features. In this approach, we take inspiration from heuristics used in\nproblems such as SAT to optimise the order in which parts of patterns are\nmatched and prune unnecessary evaluations. An empirical evaluation on 33\ndistinct games in the Ludii general game system demonstrates the efficiency of\nthis approach in comparison to a naive baseline, as well as a baseline based on\nprefix trees.",

    "abstract": "To assess fetal health during pregnancy, doctors use the gestational age (GA)\ncalculation based on the Crown Rump Length (CRL) measurement in order to check\nfor fetal size and growth trajectory. However, GA estimation based on CRL,\nrequires proper positioning of calipers on the fetal crown and rump view, which\nis not always an easy plane to find, especially for an inexperienced\nsonographer. Finding a slightly oblique view from the true CRL view could lead\nto a different CRL value and therefore incorrect estimation of GA. This study\npresents an AI-based method for a quality assessment of the CRL view by\nverifying 7 clinical scoring criteria that are used to verify the correctness\nof the acquired plane. We show how our proposed solution achieves high accuracy\non the majority of the scoring criteria when compared to an expert. We also\nshow that if such scoring system is used, it helps identify poorly acquired\nimages accurately and hence may help sonographers acquire better images which\ncould potentially lead to a better assessment of conditions such as\nIntrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR).",

    "abstract": "Online advertising is a major source of income for many online companies. One\ncommon approach is to sell online advertisements via waterfall auctions, where\na publisher makes sequential price offers to ad networks. The publisher\ncontrols the order and prices of the waterfall and by that aims to maximize his\nrevenue. In this work, we propose a methodology to learn a waterfall strategy\nfrom historical data by wisely searching in the space of possible waterfalls\nand selecting the one leading to the highest revenue. The contribution of this\nwork is twofold; First, we propose a novel method to estimate the valuation\ndistribution of each user with respect to each ad network. Second, we utilize\nthe valuation matrix to score our candidate waterfalls as part of a procedure\nthat iteratively searches in local neighborhoods. Our framework guarantees that\nthe waterfall revenue improves between iterations until converging to a local\noptimum. Real-world demonstrations are provided to show that the proposed\nmethod improves the total revenue of real-world waterfalls compared to manual\nexpert optimization. Finally, the code and the data are available here.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, semantic segmentation has taken benefit from various works\nin computer vision. Inspired by the very versatile CycleGAN architecture, we\ncombine semantic segmentation with the concept of cycle consistency to enable a\nmultitask training protocol. However, learning is largely prevented by the\nso-called steganography effect, which expresses itself as watermarks in the\nlatent segmentation domain, making image reconstruction a too easy task. To\ncombat this, we propose a noise injection, based either on quantization noise\nor on Gaussian noise addition to avoid this disadvantageous information flow in\nthe cycle architecture. We find that noise injection significantly reduces the\ngeneration of watermarks and thus allows the recognition of highly relevant\nclasses such as \"traffic signs\", which are hardly detected by the ERFNet\nbaseline. We report mIoU and PSNR results on the Cityscapes dataset for\nsemantic segmentation and image reconstruction, respectively. The proposed\nmethodology allows to achieve an mIoU improvement on the Cityscapes validation\nset of 5.7% absolute over the same CycleGAN without noise injection, and still\nan absolute 4.9% over the ERFNet non-cyclic baseline.",

    "abstract": "Deep representation learning has gained significant momentum in advancing\ntext-dependent speaker verification (TD-SV) systems. When designing deep neural\nnetworks (DNN) for extracting bottleneck features, key considerations include\ntraining targets, activation functions, and loss functions. In this paper, we\nsystematically study the impact of these choices on the performance of TD-SV.\nFor training targets, we consider speaker identity, time-contrastive learning\n(TCL) and auto-regressive prediction coding with the first being supervised and\nthe last two being self-supervised. Furthermore, we study a range of loss\nfunctions when speaker identity is used as the training target. With regard to\nactivation functions, we study the widely used sigmoid function, rectified\nlinear unit (ReLU), and Gaussian error linear unit (GELU). We experimentally\nshow that GELU is able to reduce the error rates of TD-SV significantly\ncompared to sigmoid, irrespective of training target. Among the three training\ntargets, TCL performs the best. Among the various loss functions, cross\nentropy, joint-softmax and focal loss functions outperform the others. Finally,\nscore-level fusion of different systems is also able to reduce the error rates.\nExperiments are conducted on the RedDots 2016 challenge database for TD-SV\nusing short utterances.

An\nintuitive partial remedy is to add a mask detector to flag any masked faces so\nthat the FRS can act accordingly for those low-confidence masked faces. In this\nwork, we set out to investigate the potential vulnerability of such FRS,\nequipped with a mask detector, on large-scale masked faces. As existing face\nrecognizers and mask detectors have high performance in their respective tasks,\nit is a challenge to simultaneously fool them and preserve the transferability\nof the attack. To this end, we devise realistic facial masks that exhibit\npartial face patterns (i.e., faced masks) and stealthily add adversarial\ntextures that can not only lead to significant performance deterioration of the\nSOTA deep learning-based FRS, but also remain undetected by the SOTA facial\nmask detector, thus successfully fooling both systems at the same time.

We study connections between polynomials computed by\nthese structured variants of ROABPs and other well-known classes of polynomials\n(such as depth-three powering circuits, tensor-rank and Waring rank of\npolynomials).\nOur main result concerns commutative ROABPs, where all coefficient matrices\ncommute with each other, and diagonal ROABPs, where all the coefficient\nmatrices are just diagonal matrices.

We show\nthat if the dimension of partial derivatives captures Waring rank up to\npolynomial factors, then the model of diagonal ROABPs efficiently simulates the\nseemingly more expressive model of commutative ROABPs. Further, a commutative\nROABP that cannot be efficiently simulated by a diagonal ROABP will give an\nexplicit polynomial that gives a super-polynomial separation between dimension\nof partial derivatives and Waring rank.\nOur proof of the above result builds on the results of Marinari, M\\\"oller and\nMora (1993), and M\\\"oller and Stetter (1995), that characterise rings of\ncommuting matrices in terms of polynomials that have small dimension of partial\nderivatives.

In this paper, we compare the performance\nof four python libraries, namely Optuna, Hyper-opt, Optunity, and sequential\nmodel-based algorithm configuration (SMAC) that has been proposed for\nhyper-parameter optimization. The performance of these tools is tested using\ntwo benchmarks.

    "abstract": "The Henle's fiber layer (HFL) in the retina carries valuable information on\nthe macular condition of an eye. However, in the common practice, this layer is\nnot separately segmented but rather included in the outer nuclear layer since\nit is difficult to perceive HFL contours on standard optical coherence\ntomography (OCT) imaging. Due to its variable reflectivity under an imaging\nbeam, delineating the HFL contours necessitates directional OCT, which requires\nadditional imaging. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a\nshape-preserving network, FourierNet, that achieves HFL segmentation in\nstandard OCT scans with the target performance obtained when directional OCT\nscans are used. FourierNet is a new cascaded network design that puts forward\nthe idea of benefiting the shape prior of HFL in the network training. This\ndesign proposes to represent the shape prior by extracting Fourier descriptors\non the HFL contours and defining an additional regression task of learning\nthese descriptors. It then formulates HFL segmentation as concurrent learning\nof regression and classification tasks, in which Fourier descriptors are\nestimated from an input image to encode the shape prior and used together with\nthe input image to construct the HFL segmentation map. Our experiments on 1470\nimages of 30 OCT scans reveal that quantifying the HFL shape with Fourier\ndescriptors and concurrently learning them with the main task of HFL\nsegmentation lead to better results. This indicates the effectiveness of\ndesigning a shape-preserving network to improve HFL segmentation by reducing\nthe need to perform directional OCT imaging.",

Thus, existing content-based image retrieval\n(CBIR) systems in RS require decoding images before applying CBIR (which is\ncomputationally demanding in the case of large-scale CBIR problems). To address\nthis problem, in this paper, we present a joint framework that simultaneously\nlearns RS image compression and indexing, eliminating the need for decoding RS\nimages before applying CBIR. The proposed framework is made up of two modules.\nThe first module aims at effectively compressing RS images. It is achieved\nbased on an auto-encoder architecture. The second module aims at producing hash\ncodes with a high discrimination capability. It is achieved based on a deep\nhashing method that exploits soft pairwise, bit-balancing and classification\nloss functions. We also propose a two stage learning strategy with gradient\nmanipulation techniques to obtain image representations that are compatible\nwith both RS image indexing and compression. Experimental results show the\ncompression and CBIR efficacy of the proposed framework when compared to widely\nused approaches in RS.

    "abstract": "Expressive synthetic speech is essential for many human-computer interaction\nand audio broadcast scenarios, and thus synthesizing expressive speech has\nattracted much attention in recent years. Previous methods performed the\nexpressive speech synthesis either with explicit labels or with a fixed-length\nstyle embedding extracted from reference audio, both of which can only learn an\naverage style and thus ignores the multi-scale nature of speech prosody. In\nthis paper, we propose MsEmoTTS, a multi-scale emotional speech synthesis\nframework, to model the emotion from different levels. Specifically, the\nproposed method is a typical attention-based sequence-to-sequence model and\nwith proposed three modules, including global-level emotion presenting module\n(GM), utterance-level emotion presenting module (UM), and local-level emotion\npresenting module (LM), to model the global emotion category, utterance-level\nemotion variation, and syllable-level emotion strength, respectively. In\naddition to modeling the emotion from different levels, the proposed method\nalso allows us to synthesize emotional speech in different ways, i.e.,\ntransferring the emotion from reference audio, predicting the emotion from\ninput text, and controlling the emotion strength manually. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on a Chinese emotional speech corpus demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms the compared reference audio-based and text-based\nemotional speech synthesis methods on the emotion transfer speech synthesis and\ntext-based emotion prediction speech synthesis respectively. Besides, the\nexperiments also show that the proposed method can control the emotion\nexpressions flexibly. Detailed analysis shows the effectiveness of each module\nand the good design of the proposed method.",

    "title": "Chaining Value Functions for Off-Policy Learning",
    "abstract": "To accumulate knowledge and improve its policy of behaviour, a reinforcement\nlearning agent can learn `off-policy' about policies that differ from the\npolicy used to generate its experience. This is important to learn\ncounterfactuals, or because the experience was generated out of its own\ncontrol. However, off-policy learning is non-trivial, and standard\nreinforcement-learning algorithms can be unstable and divergent.\nIn this paper we discuss a novel family of off-policy prediction algorithms\nwhich are convergent by construction. The idea is to first learn on-policy\nabout the data-generating behaviour, and then bootstrap an off-policy value\nestimate on this on-policy estimate, thereby constructing a value estimate that\nis partially off-policy. This process can be repeated to build a chain of value\nfunctions, each time bootstrapping a new estimate on the previous estimate in\nthe chain. Each step in the chain is stable and hence the complete algorithm is\nguaranteed to be stable. Under mild conditions this comes arbitrarily close to\nthe off-policy TD solution when we increase the length of the chain. Hence it\ncan compute the solution even in cases where off-policy TD diverges.\nWe prove that the proposed scheme is convergent and corresponds to an\niterative decomposition of the inverse key matrix. Furthermore it can be\ninterpreted as estimating a novel objective -- that we call a `k-step\nexpedition' -- of following the target policy for finitely many steps before\ncontinuing indefinitely with the behaviour policy. Empirically we evaluate the\nidea on challenging MDPs such as Baird's counter example and observe favourable\nresults.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework to improve the typing experience of mobile\nusers in morphologically rich languages. Smartphone keyboards typically support\nfeatures such as input decoding, corrections and predictions that all rely on\nlanguage models. For latency reasons, these operations happen on device, so the\nmodels are of limited size and cannot easily cover all the words needed by\nusers for their daily tasks, especially in morphologically rich languages. In\nparticular, the compounding nature of Germanic languages makes their vocabulary\nvirtually infinite. Similarly, heavily inflecting and agglutinative languages\n(e.g. Slavic, Turkic or Finno-Ugric languages) tend to have much larger\nvocabularies than morphologically simpler languages, such as English or\nMandarin. We propose to model such languages with automatically selected\nsubword units annotated with what we call binding types, allowing the decoder\nto know when to bind subword units into words. We show that this method brings\naround 20% word error rate reduction in a variety of compounding languages.\nThis is more than twice the improvement we previously obtained with a more\nbasic approach, also described in the paper.",

We prove that RTS finds both optima on ${\\rm T{\\small WO}M{\\small AX}}$\nefficiently if the window size $w$ is large enough. However, if $w$ is too\nsmall, RTS fails to find both optima even in exponential time, with high\nprobability. We further consider a variant of RTS selecting individuals for the\ntournament \\emph{without} replacement. It yields a more diverse tournament and\nis more effective at preventing one niche from taking over the other. However,\nthis comes at the expense of a slower progress towards optima when a niche\ncollapses to a single individual.

The inclusion of\ntemporal variance makes this framework well-suited for modeling stateful fading\nwireless channels and emerging network performance metrics such as\nage-of-information (AoI). Using this framework, we sharply characterize the\nsecond-order capacity region of wireless access networks.

To demonstrate the utility of this framework,\nwe apply it for an important open problem: the optimization of AoI over\nGilbert-Elliott channels.

    "abstract": "Pattern matching on graphs has been widely studied lately due to its\nimportance in genomics applications. Unfortunately, even the simplest problem\nof deciding if a string appears as a subpath of a graph admits a quadratic\nlower bound under the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis (Equi et al. ICALP 2019,\nSOFSEM 2021). To avoid this bottleneck, the research has shifted towards more\nspecific graph classes, e.g. those induced from multiple sequence alignments\n(MSAs). Consider segmenting $\\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,1..n]$ into $b$ blocks\n$\\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,1..j_1]$, $\\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,j_1+1..j_2]$, $\\ldots$,\n$\\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,j_{b-1}+1..n]$. The distinct strings in the rows of the\nblocks, after the removal of gap symbols, form the nodes of an elastic founder\ngraph (EFG) where the edges represent the original connections observed in the\nMSA. An EFG is called indexable if a node label occurs as a prefix of only\nthose paths that start from a node of the same block. Equi et al. (ISAAC 2021)\nshowed that such EFGs support fast pattern matching and gave an $O(mn \\log\nm)$-time algorithm for preprocessing the MSA in a way that allows the\nconstruction of indexable EFGs maximizing the number of blocks and,\nalternatively, minimizing the maximum length of a block, in $O(n)$ and $O(n\n\\log\\log n)$ time respectively. Using the suffix tree and solving a novel\nancestor problem on trees, we improve the preprocessing to $O(mn)$ time and the\n$O(n \\log \\log n)$-time EFG construction to $O(n)$ time, thus showing that both\ntypes of indexable EFGs can be constructed in time linear in the input size.",

However, it remains challenging to\nmake these two data sources complementary and beneficial to each other. In this\npaper, we propose \\textit{AutoAlign}, an automatic feature fusion strategy for\n3D object detection. Instead of establishing deterministic correspondence with\ncamera projection matrix, we model the mapping relationship between the image\nand point clouds with a learnable alignment map. This map enables our model to\nautomate the alignment of non-homogenous features in a dynamic and data-driven\nmanner. Specifically, a cross-attention feature alignment module is devised to\nadaptively aggregate \\textit{pixel-level} image features for each voxel. To\nenhance the semantic consistency during feature alignment, we also design a\nself-supervised cross-modal feature interaction module, through which the model\ncan learn feature aggregation with \\textit{instance-level} feature guidance.\nExtensive experimental results show that our approach can lead to 2.3 mAP and\n7.0 mAP improvements on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, respectively.

The established energy identities provide a precise\ncharacterization on whether and how the energy dissipates in the RK\ndiscretization, thereby leading to weak and strong stability criteria of RK\nmethods. Furthermore, we discover a unified energy identity for all the\ndiagonal Pade approximations, based on an analytical Cholesky type\ndecomposition of a class of symmetric matrices. The structure of the matrices\nis very complicated, rendering the discovery of the unified energy identity and\nthe proof of the decomposition highly challenging.

Our framework is motivated by a discrete\nanalogue of integration by parts technique and a series expansion of the\ncontinuous energy law. In some special cases, our analyses establish a close\nconnection between the continuous and discrete energy laws, enhancing our\nunderstanding of their intrinsic mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Compressing deep networks is essential to expand their range of applications\nto constrained settings. The need for compression however often arises long\nafter the model was trained, when the original data might no longer be\navailable. On the other hand, unlabeled data, not necessarily related to the\ntarget task, is usually plentiful, especially in image classification tasks. In\nthis work, we propose a scheme to leverage such samples to distill the\nknowledge learned by a large teacher network to a smaller student. The proposed\ntechnique relies on (i) preferentially sampling datapoints that appear related,\nand (ii) taking better advantage of the learning signal.

Homophily and social\ninfluence are able generate these fault lines on their own; however, social\nidentities from demographics may serve as coordinating mechanisms through which\nlifestyle politics are mobilized are spread. Using a dataset of 137,661,886\nobservations from 299,327 Facebook interests aggregated across users of\ndifferent racial/ethnic, education, age, gender, and income demographics, we\nfind that the most extreme instances of lifestyle politics are those which are\nhighly confounded by demographics such as race/ethnicity (e.g., Black artists\nand performers). After adjusting political alignment for demographic effects,\nlifestyle politics decreased by 27.36% toward the political \"center\" and\ndemographically confounded interests were no longer among the most polarized\ninterests. Instead, after demographic deconfounding, we found that the most\nliberal interests included electric cars, Planned Parenthood, and liberal\nsatire while the most conservative interests included the Republican Party and\nconservative commentators. We validate our measures of political alignment and\nlifestyle politics using the General Social Survey and find similar demographic\nentanglements with lifestyle politics existed before social media such as\nFacebook were ubiquitous, giving us strong confidence that our results are not\ndue to echo chambers or filter bubbles. Likewise, since demographic\ncharacteristics exist prior to ideological values, we argue that the\ndemographic confounding we observe is causally responsible for the extreme\ninstances of lifestyle politics that we find among the aggregated interests. We\nconclude our paper by relating our results to Simpson's paradox, cultural\nomnivorousness, and network autocorrelation.",

Typically, these non-functional requirements originate from\ndifferent domains and their concrete scope, notion, and demarcation to\nfunctional requirements is often ambiguous. In this study we seek to categorize\nand analyze relevant work related to software engineering in a DevOps context\nin order to clarify the different focus areas, themes, and objectives\nunderlying non-functional requirements and also to identify future research\ndirections in this field. We conducted a systematic mapping study, including\n142 selected primary studies, extracted the focus areas, and synthesized the\nthemes and objectives of the described NFRs. In order to examine\nnon-engineering-focused studies related to non-functional requirements in\nDevOps, we conducted a backward snowballing step and additionally included 17\nprimary studies. Our analysis revealed 7 recurrent focus areas and 41 themes\nthat characterize NFRs in DevOps, along with typical objectives for these\nthemes. Overall, the focus areas and themes of NFRs in DevOps are very diverse\nand reflect the different perspectives required to align software engineering\nwith technical quality, business, compliance, and organizational\nconsiderations. The lack of methodological support for specifying, measuring,\nand evaluating fulfillment of these NFRs in DevOps-driven projects offers ample\nopportunities for future research in this field.

    "abstract": "We study the non-stationary stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, where the\nreward statistics of each arm may change several times during the course of\nlearning. The performance of a learning algorithm is evaluated in terms of\ntheir dynamic regret, which is defined as the difference of the expected\ncumulative reward of an agent choosing the optimal arm in every round and the\ncumulative reward of the learning algorithm. One way to measure the hardness of\nsuch environments is to consider how many times the identity of the optimal arm\ncan change. We propose a method that achieves, in $K$-armed bandit problems, a\nnear-optimal $\\widetilde O(\\sqrt{K N(S+1)})$ dynamic regret, where $N$ is the\nnumber of rounds and $S$ is the number of times the identity of the optimal arm\nchanges, without prior knowledge of $S$ and $N$.

In continual learning (CL), training samples come in subsequent\ntasks, and the trained model can access only a single task at a time.

This\nrecurrence leads to superfluous computations as the same past samples are\nregenerated after each task, and the reconstruction quality successively\ndegrades. In this work, we address these limitations and propose a new\ngenerative rehearsal architecture that requires at most logarithmic number of\nretraining for each sample. Our approach leverages allocation of past data in\na~set of generative models such that most of them do not require retraining\nafter a~task.

    "abstract": "THz communication is regarded as one of the potential key enablers for\nnext-generation wireless systems. While THz frequency bands provide abundant\nbandwidths and extremely high data rates, the operation at THz bands is\nmandated by short communication ranges and narrow pencil beams, which are\nhighly susceptible to user mobility and beam misalignment as well as channel\nblockages. This raises the need for novel beam tracking methods that take into\naccount the tradeoff between enhancing the received signal strength by\nincreasing beam directivity, and increasing the coverage probability by\nwidening the beam. To address these challenges, a multi-objective optimization\nproblem is formulated with the goal of jointly maximizing the ergodic rate and\nminimizing the outage probability subject to transmit power and average\noverhead constraints. Then, a novel parameterized beamformer with dynamic\nbeamwidth adaptation is proposed. In addition to the precoder, an event-based\nbeam tracking approach is introduced that enables reacting to outages caused by\nbeam misalignment and dynamic blockage while maintaining a low pilot overhead.\nSimulation results show that our proposed beamforming scheme improves average\nrate performance and reduces the amount of communication outages caused by beam\nmisalignment. Moreover, the proposed event-triggered channel estimation\napproach enables low-overhead yet reliable communication.",

Existing research, however, focuses on specific market segments and\nproducts and has not evaluated this trend's full breadth. If such fault lines\ndo spread into other segments that are not explicitly political, it would\nindicate the presence of lifestyle politics -- when ideas and behaviors not\ninherently political become politically aligned through their connections with\nexplicitly political things. We study the pervasiveness of polarization and\nlifestyle politics over different product segments in a diverse market and test\nthe extent to which consumer- and platform-level network effects and morality\nmay explain lifestyle politics. Specifically, using graph and language data\nfrom Amazon (82.5M reviews of 9.5M products and product and category metadata\nfrom 1996-2014), we sample 234.6 million relations among 21.8 million market\nentities to find product categories that are most politically relevant,\naligned, and polarized. We then extract moral values present in reviews' text\nand use these data and other reviewer-, product-, and category-level data to\ntest whether individual- and platform- level network factors explain lifestyle\npolitics better than products' implicit morality. We find pervasive lifestyle\npolitics. Cultural products are 4 times more polarized than any other segment,\nproducts' political attributes have up to 3.7 times larger associations with\nlifestyle politics than author-level covariates, and morality has statistically\nsignificant but relatively small correlations with lifestyle politics.\nExamining lifestyle politics in these contexts helps us better understand the\nextent and root of partisan differences, why Americans may be so polarized, and\nhow this polarization affects market systems.",

    "abstract": "The infusion of renewable energy sources into the conventional synchronous\ngeneration system decreases the overall system inertia and negatively impacts\nthe stability of its primary frequency response. The lowered inertia is due to\nthe absence of inertia in some of the renewable energy-based systems. To\nmaintain the stability of the system, we need to keep the frequency in the\npermissible limits and maintain low rotational inertia. Some authors in the\nliterature have used the virtual synchronous generators (VSG) as a solution to\nthis problem. Although the VSG based distributed recourses (DER) exhibits the\ncharacteristics and behavior of synchronous generators (SG) such as inertia,\nfrequency droop functions and damping but it does not optimally solve the\nquestion of frequency stability. This paper presents a solution for these\nproblems via an empirical model that sizes the Battery Energy Storage System\n(BESS) required for the inertia emulation and damping control. The tested\nsystem consists of a Photovoltaic (PV) based VSG that is connected to a 9-Bus\ngrid and the simulation experiments are carried out using EMTP software. The\nVSG transient response is initiated by a symmetric fault on the grid side. Our\nsimulations show the battery energy sizing required to emulate the virtual\ninertia corresponding to several design parameters, i.e., the droop gain,\nK{\\omega}, the droop coefficient, Kd, and the VSG time constant Ta.",

    "title": "BDA-SketRet: Bi-Level Domain Adaptation for Zero-Shot SBIR",
    "abstract": "The efficacy of zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR) models is\ngoverned by two challenges. The immense distributions-gap between the sketches\nand the images requires a proper domain alignment. Moreover, the fine-grained\nnature of the task and the high intra-class variance of many categories\nnecessitates a class-wise discriminative mapping among the sketch, image, and\nthe semantic spaces. Under this premise, we propose BDA-SketRet, a novel\nZS-SBIR framework performing a bi-level domain adaptation for aligning the\nspatial and semantic features of the visual data pairs progressively. In order\nto highlight the shared features and reduce the effects of any sketch or\nimage-specific artifacts, we propose a novel symmetric loss function based on\nthe notion of information bottleneck for aligning the semantic features while a\ncross-entropy-based adversarial loss is introduced to align the spatial feature\nmaps. Finally, our CNN-based model confirms the discriminativeness of the\nshared latent space through a novel topology-preserving semantic projection\nnetwork. Experimental results on the extended Sketchy, TU-Berlin, and QuickDraw\ndatasets exhibit sharp improvements over the literature.",

As an implicit\ncrowdsourcing experience, we have gathered a large collection of original and\nparaphrased sentences from Hamtajoo; a Persian plagiarism detection system, in\nwhich users try to conceal cases of text re-use in their documents by\nparaphrasing and re-submitting manuscripts for analysis. The compiled dataset\ncontains 2446 instances of paraphrasing. In order to improve the overall\nquality of the collected data, some heuristics have been used to exclude\nsentences that don't meet the proposed criteria. The introduced corpus is much\nlarger than the available datasets for the task of paraphrase identification in\nPersian. Moreover, there is less bias in the data compared to the similar\ndatasets, since the users did not try some fixed predefined rules in order to\ngenerate similar texts to their original inputs.",

    "abstract": "Class-conditioning offers a direct means of controlling a Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN) based on a discrete input variable. While necessary\nin many applications, the additional information provided by the class labels\ncould even be expected to benefit the training of the GAN itself. Contrary to\nthis belief, we observe that class-conditioning causes mode collapse in limited\ndata settings, where unconditional learning leads to satisfactory generative\nability. Motivated by this observation, we propose a training strategy for\nconditional GANs (cGANs) that effectively prevents the observed mode-collapse\nby leveraging unconditional learning. Our training strategy starts with an\nunconditional GAN and gradually injects conditional information into the\ngenerator and the objective function. The proposed method for training cGANs\nwith limited data results not only in stable training but also in generating\nhigh-quality images, thanks to the early-stage exploitation of the shared\ninformation across classes. We analyze the aforementioned mode collapse problem\nin comprehensive experiments on four datasets.

    "title": "Free Lunch for Testing: Fuzzing Deep-Learning Libraries from Open Source",
    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) systems can make our life much easier, and thus is gaining\nmore and more attention from both academia and industry. Meanwhile, bugs in DL\nsystems can be disastrous, and can even threaten human lives in safety-critical\napplications. To date, a huge body of research efforts have been dedicated to\ntesting DL models. However, interestingly, there is still limited work for\ntesting the underlying DL libraries, which are the foundation for building,\noptimizing, and running the DL models. One potential reason is that test\ngeneration for the underlying DL libraries can be rather challenging since\ntheir public APIs are mainly exposed in Python, making it even hard to\nautomatically determine the API input parameter types due to dynamic typing. In\nthis paper, we propose FreeFuzz, the first approach to fuzzing DL libraries via\nmining from open source. More specifically, FreeFuzz obtains code/models from\nthree different sources: 1) code snippets from the library documentation, 2)\nlibrary developer tests, and 3) DL models in the wild. Then, FreeFuzz\nautomatically runs all the collected code/models with instrumentation to trace\nthe dynamic information for each covered API, including the types and values of\neach parameter during invocation, and shapes of input/output tensors. Lastly,\nFreeFuzz will leverage the traced dynamic information to perform fuzz testing\nfor each covered API. The extensive study of FreeFuzz on PyTorch and\nTensorFlow, two of the most popular DL libraries, shows that FreeFuzz is able\nto automatically trace valid dynamic information for fuzzing 1158 popular APIs,\n9X more than state-of-the-art LEMON with 3.5X lower overhead than LEMON.\nFurthermore, FreeFuzz is able to detect 35 bugs for PyTorch and TensorFlow\n(with 31 confirmed by developers and 30 previously unknown).",

    "abstract": "Query expansion is the process of reformulating the original query by adding\nrelevant words. Choosing which terms to add in order to improve the performance\nof the query expansion methods or to enhance the quality of the retrieved\nresults is an important aspect of any information retrieval system. Adding\nwords that can positively impact the quality of the search query or are\ninformative enough play an important role in returning or gathering relevant\ndocuments that cover a certain topic can result in improving the efficiency of\nthe information retrieval system. Typically, query expansion techniques are\nused to add or substitute words to a given search query to collect relevant\ndata. In this paper, we design and implement a pipeline of automated query\nexpansion. We outline several tools using different methods to expand the\nquery. Our methods depend on targeting emergent events in streaming data over\ntime and finding the hidden topics from targeted documents using probabilistic\ntopic models. We employ Dynamic Eigenvector Centrality to trigger the emergent\nevents, and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation to discover the topics. Also, we\nuse an external data source as a secondary stream to supplement the primary\nstream with relevant words and expand the query using the words from both\nprimary and secondary streams. An experimental study is performed on Twitter\ndata (primary stream) related to the events that happened during protests in\nBaltimore in 2015. The quality of the retrieved results was measured using a\nquality indicator of the streaming data: tweets count, hashtag count, and\nhashtag clustering.",

    "abstract": "The automation of condition monitoring and workpiece inspection plays an\nessential role in maintaining high quality as well as high throughput of the\nmanufacturing process. To this end, the recent rise of developments in machine\nlearning has lead to vast improvements in the area of autonomous process\nsupervision. However, the more complex and powerful these models become, the\nless transparent and explainable they generally are as well. One of the main\nchallenges is the monitoring of live deployments of these machine learning\nsystems and raising alerts when encountering events that might impact model\nperformance. In particular, supervised classifiers are typically build under\nthe assumption of stationarity in the underlying data distribution. For\nexample, a visual inspection system trained on a set of material surface\ndefects generally does not adapt or even recognize gradual changes in the data\ndistribution - an issue known as \"data drift\" - such as the emergence of new\ntypes of surface defects. This, in turn, may lead to detrimental\nmispredictions, e.g. samples from new defect classes being classified as\nnon-defective. To this end, it is desirable to provide real-time tracking of a\nclassifier's performance to inform about the putative onset of additional error\nclasses and the necessity for manual intervention with respect to classifier\nre-training. Here, we propose an unsupervised framework that acts on top of a\nsupervised classification system, thereby harnessing its internal deep feature\nrepresentations as a proxy to track changes in the data distribution during\ndeployment and, hence, to anticipate classifier performance degradation.",

The successful deployment of\nsuch systems hinges on the availability of reliable inter-agent communication.\nHowever, many sources of potential disruption to communication exist in\npractice, such as radio interference, hardware failure, and adversarial\nattacks. In this work, we develop joint policies for cooperative multiagent\nsystems that are robust to potential losses in communication. More\nspecifically, we develop joint policies for cooperative Markov games with\nreach-avoid objectives. First, we propose an algorithm for the decentralized\nexecution of joint policies during periods of communication loss. Next, we use\nthe total correlation of the state-action process induced by a joint policy as\na measure of the intrinsic dependencies between the agents. We then use this\nmeasure to lower-bound the performance of a joint policy when communication is\nlost. Finally, we present an algorithm that maximizes a proxy to this lower\nbound in order to synthesize minimum-dependency joint policies that are robust\nto communication loss. Numerical experiments show that the proposed\nminimum-dependency policies require minimal coordination between the agents\nwhile incurring little to no loss in performance; the total correlation value\nof the synthesized policy is one fifth of the total correlation value of the\nbaseline policy which does not take potential communication losses into\naccount. As a result, the performance of the minimum-dependency policies\nremains consistently high regardless of whether or not communication is\navailable. By contrast, the performance of the baseline policy decreases by\ntwenty percent when communication is lost.",

    "abstract": "Object detection is increasingly used onboard Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)\nfor various applications; however, the machine learning (ML) models for\nUAV-based detection are often validated using data curated for tasks unrelated\nto the UAV application. This is a concern because training neural networks on\nlarge-scale benchmarks have shown excellent capability in generic object\ndetection tasks, yet conventional training approaches can lead to large\ninference errors for UAV-based images. Such errors arise due to differences in\nimaging conditions between images from UAVs and images in training. To overcome\nthis problem, we characterize boundary conditions of ML models, beyond which\nthe models exhibit rapid degradation in detection accuracy. Our work is focused\non understanding the impact of different UAV-based imaging conditions on\ndetection performance by using synthetic data generated using a game engine.\nProperties of the game engine are exploited to populate the synthetic datasets\nwith realistic and annotated images. Specifically, it enables the fine control\nof various parameters, such as camera position, view angle, illumination\nconditions, and object pose. Using the synthetic datasets, we analyze detection\naccuracy in different imaging conditions as a function of the above parameters.\nWe use three well-known neural network models with different model complexity\nin our work. In our experiment, we observe and quantify the following: 1) how\ndetection accuracy drops as the camera moves toward the nadir-view region; 2)\nhow detection accuracy varies depending on different object poses, and 3) the\ndegree to which the robustness of the models changes as illumination conditions\nvary.",

The most classical result is a bound for balanced truncation\nand singular perturbation approximation that is applicable for asymptotically\nstable linear time-invariant systems with homogeneous initial conditions.\nRecently, there have been a few attempts to generalize the balancing-related\nreduction methods to the case with inhomogeneous initial conditions, but the\nexisting error bounds for these generalizations are quite restrictive.\nParticularly, it is required to restrict the initial conditions to a\nlow-dimensional subspace, which has to be chosen before the reduced model is\nconstructed.

One can prove enhanced\nstability results, not only on the physical domain, but on the whole active\nmesh. However, the stability constants grow exponentially with the polynomial\norder being used, since the underlying extension operators are defined via\nextrapolation. To address this issue, we introduce a new variant of aggregated\nfinite elements, in which the extension in the physical domain is an\ninterpolation for polynomials of order higher than two. As a result, the\nstability constants only grow at a polynomial rate with the order of\napproximation.

In this work, we empirically analyze how the\namount of hate speech in replies to posts from politicians on Twitter depends\non personal characteristics, such as their party affiliation, gender, and\nethnicity. For this purpose, we employ Twitter's Historical API to collect\nevery tweet posted by members of the 117th U.S. Congress for an observation\nperiod of more than six months. Additionally, we gather replies for each tweet\nand use machine learning to predict the amount of hate speech they embed.\nSubsequently, we implement hierarchical regression models to analyze whether\npoliticians with certain characteristics receive more hate speech. We find that\ntweets are particularly likely to receive hate speech in replies if they are\nauthored by (i) persons of color from the Democratic party, (ii) white\nRepublicans, and (iii) women. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that more\nnegative sentiment (in the source tweet) is associated with more hate speech\n(in replies). However, the association varies across parties: negative\nsentiment attracts more hate speech for Democrats (vs. Republicans).\nAltogether, our empirical findings imply significant differences in how\npoliticians are treated on social media depending on their party affiliation,\ngender, and ethnicity.",

We empirically show that two\nsimple unlearning methods, exact-unlearning and catastrophic-forgetting the\nfinal k layers of a network, scale well to large deletion sets unlike prior\nunlearning methods. k controls the forgetting-efficiency tradeoff at similar\nutility.

    "abstract": "Although autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize\ntransportation, robust perception across a wide range of driving contexts\nremains a significant challenge. Techniques to fuse sensor data from camera,\nradar, and lidar sensors have been proposed to improve AV perception. However,\nexisting methods are insufficiently robust in difficult driving contexts (e.g.,\nbad weather, low light, sensor obstruction) due to rigidity in their fusion\nimplementations. These methods fall into two broad categories: (i) early\nfusion, which fails when sensor data is noisy or obscured, and (ii) late\nfusion, which cannot leverage features from multiple sensors and thus produces\nworse estimates. To address these limitations, we propose HydraFusion: a\nselective sensor fusion framework that learns to identify the current driving\ncontext and fuses the best combination of sensors to maximize robustness\nwithout compromising efficiency. HydraFusion is the first approach to propose\ndynamically adjusting between early fusion, late fusion, and combinations\nin-between, thus varying both how and when fusion is applied. We show that, on\naverage, HydraFusion outperforms early and late fusion approaches by 13.66% and\n14.54%, respectively, without increasing computational complexity or energy\nconsumption on the industry-standard Nvidia Drive PX2 AV hardware platform. We\nalso propose and evaluate both static and deep-learning-based context\nidentification strategies.

    "abstract": "Obstacle avoidance of quadrotors in dynamic environments, with both static\nand dynamic obstacles, is still a very open problem. Current works commonly\nleverage traditional static maps to represent static obstacles and the\ndetection and tracking of moving objects (DATMO) method to model dynamic\nobstacles separately. The dynamic obstacles are pre-trained in the detector and\ncan only be modeled with certain shapes, such as cylinders or ellipsoids. This\nwork utilizes our dual-structure particle-based (DSP) dynamic occupancy map to\nrepresent the arbitrary-shaped static obstacles and dynamic obstacles\nsimultaneously and proposes an efficient risk-aware sampling-based local\ntrajectory planner to realize safe flights in this map. The trajectory is\nplanned by sampling motion primitives generated in the state space. Each motion\nprimitive is divided into two phases: short-term planning with a strict risk\nlimitation and relatively long-term planning designed to avoid high-risk\nregions. The risk is evaluated with the predicted future occupancy status,\nrepresented by particles, considering the time dimension. With an approach to\nsplit from and merge to global trajectories, the planner can also be used with\nan arbitrary preplanned global trajectory. Comparison experiments show that the\nobstacle avoidance system composed of the DSP map and our planner performs the\nbest in dynamic environments. In real-world tests, our quadrotor reaches a\nspeed of 6 m/s with the motion capture system and 2 m/s with everything\ncomputed on a low-price single board computer.",

    "abstract": "Providing feedback on the argumentation of learner is essential for\ndevelopment of critical thinking skills, but it takes a lot of time and effort.\nTo reduce the burden on teachers, we aim to automate a process of giving\nfeedback, especially giving diagnostic comments which point out the weaknesses\ninherent in the argumentation. It is advisable to give specific diagnostic\ncomments so that learners can recognize the diagnosis without misunderstanding.\nHowever, it is not obvious how the task of providing specific diagnostic\ncomments should be formulated. We present a formulation of the task as template\nselection and slot filling to make an automatic evaluation easier and the\nbehavior of the model more tractable. The key to the formulation is the\npossibility of creating a template set that is sufficient for practical use. In\nthis paper, we define three criteria that a template set should satisfy:\nexpressiveness, informativeness, and uniqueness, and verify the feasibility to\ncreate a template set that satisfies these criteria as a first trial. We will\nshow that it is feasible through an annotation study that converts diagnostic\ncomments given in text into a template format. The corpus used in the\nannotation study is publicly available.",

    "title": "Improved Approximation and Scalability for Fair Max-Min Diversification",
    "abstract": "Given an $n$-point metric space $(\\mathcal{X},d)$ where each point belongs to\none of $m=O(1)$ different categories or groups and a set of integers $k_1,\n\\ldots, k_m$, the fair Max-Min diversification problem is to select $k_i$\npoints belonging to category $i\\in [m]$, such that the minimum pairwise\ndistance between selected points is maximized. The problem was introduced by\nMoumoulidou et al. [ICDT 2021] and is motivated by the need to down-sample\nlarge data sets in various applications so that the derived sample achieves a\nbalance over diversity, i.e., the minimum distance between a pair of selected\npoints, and fairness, i.e., ensuring enough points of each category are\nincluded. We prove the following results:\n1. We first consider general metric spaces. We present a randomized\npolynomial time algorithm that returns a factor $2$-approximation to the\ndiversity but only satisfies the fairness constraints in expectation. Building\nupon this result, we present a $6$-approximation that is guaranteed to satisfy\nthe fairness constraints up to a factor $1-\\epsilon$ for any constant\n$\\epsilon$. We also present a linear time algorithm returning an $m+1$\napproximation with exact fairness. The best previous result was a $3m-1$\napproximation.\n2. We then focus on Euclidean metrics. We first show that the problem can be\nsolved exactly in one dimension. For constant dimensions, categories and any\nconstant $\\epsilon>0$, we present a $1+\\epsilon$ approximation algorithm that\nruns in $O(nk) + 2^{O(k)}$ time where $k=k_1+\\ldots+k_m$. We can improve the\nrunning time to $O(nk)+ poly(k)$ at the expense of only picking $(1-\\epsilon)\nk_i$ points from category $i\\in [m]$.\nFinally, we present algorithms suitable to processing massive data sets\nincluding single-pass data stream algorithms and composable coresets for the\ndistributed processing.",

    "abstract": "Referring expression grounding is an important and challenging task in\ncomputer vision. To avoid the laborious annotation in conventional referring\ngrounding, unpaired referring grounding is introduced, where the training data\nonly contains a number of images and queries without correspondences. The few\nexisting solutions to unpaired referring grounding are still preliminary, due\nto the challenges of learning image-text matching and lack of the top-down\nguidance with unpaired data. In this paper, we propose a novel bidirectional\ncross-modal matching (BiCM) framework to address these challenges.\nParticularly, we design a query-aware attention map (QAM) module that\nintroduces top-down perspective via generating query-specific visual attention\nmaps. A cross-modal object matching (COM) module is further introduced, which\nexploits the recently emerged image-text matching pretrained model, CLIP, to\npredict the target objects from a bottom-up perspective. The top-down and\nbottom-up predictions are then integrated via a similarity funsion (SF) module.\nWe also propose a knowledge adaptation matching (KAM) module that leverages\nunpaired training data to adapt pretrained knowledge to the target dataset and\ntask. Experiments show that our framework outperforms previous works by 6.55%\nand 9.94% on two popular grounding datasets.",

    "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that transparency of automated decision making is\ncrucial for deployability of intelligent systems, and explaining the reasons\nwhy some decisions are \"good\" and some are not is a way to achieving this\ntransparency. We consider two variants of decision making, where \"good\"\ndecisions amount to alternatives (i) meeting \"most\" goals, and (ii) meeting\n\"most preferred\" goals. We then define, for each variant and notion of\n\"goodness\" (corresponding to a number of existing notions in the literature),\nexplanations in two formats, for justifying the selection of an alternative to\naudiences with differing needs and competences: lean explanations, in terms of\ngoals satisfied and, for some notions of \"goodness\", alternative decisions, and\nargumentative explanations, reflecting the decision process leading to the\nselection, while corresponding to the lean explanations. To define\nargumentative explanations, we use assumption-based argumentation (ABA), a\nwell-known form of structured argumentation. Specifically, we define ABA\nframeworks such that \"good\" decisions are admissible ABA arguments and draw\nargumentative explanations from dispute trees sanctioning this admissibility.\nFinally, we instantiate our overall framework for explainable decision-making\nto accommodate connections between goals and decisions in terms of decision\ngraphs incorporating defeasible and non-defeasible information.",

Recently, a new EMO framework has been proposed to solve this\nissue by storing all the non-dominated solutions generated during the evolution\nin an archive and selecting a subset of solutions from the archive as the\noutput. The key component in this framework is the subset selection from the\narchive which usually stores a large number of candidate solutions. However,\nmost studies on subset selection focus on small candidate solution sets for\nenvironmental selection. There is no benchmark test suite for large-scale\nsubset selection. This paper aims to fill this research gap by proposing a\nbenchmark test suite for subset selection from large candidate solution sets,\nand comparing some representative methods using the proposed test suite. The\nproposed test suite together with the benchmarking studies provides a baseline\nfor researchers to understand, use, compare, and develop subset selection\nmethods in the EMO field.",

As a safety net, it is a natural idea to improve a\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer, which updates the network\nparameters as the final process of learning, to be more robust to noise. The\nrelated work revealed that the first momentum utilized in the Adam-like SGD\noptimizers can be modified based on the noise-robust student's t-distribution,\nresulting in inheriting the robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose\nAdaTerm, which derives not only the first momentum but also all the involved\nstatistics based on the student's t-distribution. If the computed gradients\nseem to probably be aberrant, AdaTerm is expected to exclude the computed\ngradients for updates, and reinforce the robustness for the next updates;\notherwise, it updates the network parameters normally, and can relax the\nrobustness for the next updates. With this noise-adaptive behavior, the\nexcellent learning performance of AdaTerm was confirmed via typical\noptimization problems with several cases where the noise ratio would be\ndifferent.",

The introduction of causal techniques into\nrecommender systems (RS) has brought great development to this field and has\ngradually become a trend. However, a unified causal analysis framework has not\nbeen established yet. On one hand, the existing causal methods in RS lack a\nclear causal and mathematical formalization on the scientific questions of\ninterest. Many confusions need to be clarified: what exactly is being\nestimated, for what purpose, in which scenario, by which technique, and under\nwhat plausible assumptions. On the other hand, technically speaking, the\nexistence of various biases is the main obstacle to drawing causal conclusions\nfrom observed data. Yet, formal definitions of the biases in RS are still not\nclear. Both of the limitations greatly hinder the development of RS.\nIn this paper, we attempt to give a causal analysis framework to accommodate\ndifferent scenarios in RS, thereby providing a principled and rigorous\noperational guideline for causal recommendation. We first propose a\nstep-by-step guideline on how to clarify and investigate problems in RS using\ncausal concepts. Then, we provide a new taxonomy and give a formal definition\nof various biases in RS from the perspective of violating what assumptions are\nadopted in standard causal analysis.

    "abstract": "In solving multi-modal, multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs), the\nobjective is not only to find a good representation of the Pareto-optimal front\n(PF) in the objective space but also to find all equivalent Pareto-optimal\nsubsets (PSS) in the variable space. Such problems are practically relevant\nwhen a decision maker (DM) is interested in identifying alternative designs\nwith similar performance. There has been significant research interest in\nrecent years to develop efficient algorithms to deal with MMOPs. However, the\nexisting algorithms still require prohibitive number of function evaluations\n(often in several thousands) to deal with problems involving as low as two\nobjectives and two variables. The algorithms are typically embedded with\nsophisticated, customized mechanisms that require additional parameters to\nmanage the diversity and convergence in the variable and the objective spaces.\nIn this letter, we introduce a steady-state evolutionary algorithm for solving\nMMOPs, with a simple design and no additional userdefined parameters that need\ntuning compared to a standard EA. We report its performance on 21 MMOPs from\nvarious test suites that are widely used for benchmarking using a low\ncomputational budget of 1000 function evaluations. The performance of the\nproposed algorithm is compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms (MO Ring\nPSO SCD, DN-NSGAII, TriMOEA-TA&R, CPDEA, MMOEA/DC and MMEA-WI). The proposed\nalgorithm exhibits significantly better performance than the above algorithms\nbased on the established metrics including IGDX, PSP and IGD. We hope this\nstudy would encourage design of simple, efficient and generalized algorithms to\nimprove its uptake for practical applications.",

    "abstract": "The release note is an essential software artifact of open-source software\nthat documents crucial information about changes, such as new features and bug\nfixes. With the help of release notes, both developers and users could have a\ngeneral understanding of the latest version without browsing the source code.\nHowever, it is a daunting and time-consuming job for developers to produce\nrelease notes. Although prior studies have provided some automatic approaches,\nthey generate release notes mainly by extracting information from code changes.\nThis will result in language-specific and not being general enough to be\napplicable. Therefore, helping developers produce release notes effectively\nremains an unsolved challenge. To address the problem, we first conduct a\nmanual study on the release notes of 900 GitHub projects, which reveals that\nmore than 54% of projects produce their release notes with pull requests. Based\non the empirical finding, we propose a deep learning based approach named\nDeepRelease (Deep learning based Release notes generator) to generate release\nnotes according to pull requests. The process of release notes generation in\nDeepRelease includes the change entries generation and the change category\n(i.e., new features or bug fixes) generation, which are formulated as a text\nsummarization task and a multi-class classification problem, respectively.\nSince DeepRelease fully employs text information from pull requests to\nsummarize changes and identify the change category, it is language-agnostic and\ncan be used for projects in any language. We build a dataset with over 46K\nrelease notes and evaluate DeepRelease on the dataset. The experimental results\nindicate that DeepRelease outperforms four baselines and can generate release\nnotes similar to those manually written ones in a fraction of the time.",

    "abstract": "Hate speech is a major issue in social networks due to the high volume of\ndata generated daily. Recent works demonstrate the usefulness of machine\nlearning (ML) in dealing with the nuances required to distinguish between\nhateful posts from just sarcasm or offensive language. Many ML solutions for\nhate speech detection have been proposed by either changing how features are\nextracted from the text or the classification algorithm employed. However, most\nworks consider only one type of feature extraction and classification\nalgorithm. This work argues that a combination of multiple feature extraction\ntechniques and different classification models is needed. We propose a\nframework to analyze the relationship between multiple feature extraction and\nclassification techniques to understand how they complement each other. The\nframework is used to select a subset of complementary techniques to compose a\nrobust multiple classifiers system (MCS) for hate speech detection. The\nexperimental study considering four hate speech classification datasets\ndemonstrates that the proposed framework is a promising methodology for\nanalyzing and designing high-performing MCS for this task. MCS system obtained\nusing the proposed framework significantly outperforms the combination of all\nmodels and the homogeneous and heterogeneous selection heuristics,\ndemonstrating the importance of having a proper selection scheme.

Drawing on 89,575 self-reports of team member research activity\nunderlying scientific publications, we show how individual activities cohere\ninto broad roles of (1) leadership through the direction and presentation of\nresearch and (2) support through data collection, analysis and discussion. The\nhidden hierarchy of a scientific team is characterized by its lead (or L)-ratio\nof members playing leadership roles to total team size. The L-ratio is\nvalidated through correlation with imputed contributions to the specific paper\nand to science as a whole, which we use to effectively extrapolate the L-ratio\nfor 16,397,750 papers where roles are not explicit. We find that relative to\nflat, egalitarian teams, tall, hierarchical teams produce less novelty and more\noften develop existing ideas; increase productivity for those on top and\ndecrease it for those beneath; increase short-term citations but decrease\nlong-term influence. These effects hold within-person -- the same person on the\nsame-sized team produces science much more likely to disruptively innovate if\nthey work on a flat, high L-ratio team.

This paper provides\na method for combining aircraft pose uncertainty with single-pulse radar\ndetection models to aid mission planning efforts.

To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge\ndistillation framework to exploit the related external textual knowledge to\nassist the visual anticipation task.

In order to improve the reliability and accuracy of small-sized road\nextraction when roads of multiple sizes coexist in an HRSI, an enhanced deep\nneural network model termed Dual-Decoder-U-Net (DDU-Net) is proposed in this\npaper.

Our solution surpasses the performance of similarly sized models\nand is also competitive with larger models. A special feature of our solution\nis that it even runs locally in a web browser. We also provide a working\nexample of this browser-based implementation. Our model is evaluated on\ndifferent corpora, with emphasis on the Hungarian language. We performed\ncomparative measurements about the generalization power of the model in\nrelation to three Hungarian corpora.

To tackle this open-set annotation (OSA) problem, we\npropose a new active learning framework called LfOSA, which boosts the\nclassification performance with an effective sampling strategy to precisely\ndetect examples from known classes for annotation. The LfOSA framework\nintroduces an auxiliary network to model the per-example max activation value\n(MAV) distribution with a Gaussian Mixture Model, which can dynamically select\nthe examples with highest probability from known classes in the unlabeled set.\nMoreover, by reducing the temperature $T$ of the loss function, the detection\nmodel will be further optimized by exploiting both known and unknown\nsupervision. The experimental results show that the proposed method can\nsignificantly improve the selection quality of known classes, and achieve\nhigher classification accuracy with lower annotation cost than state-of-the-art\nactive learning methods.

Once they are trained, deep\nlearning models can be deployed on edge computers to perform classification and\nprediction on real-time data for these applications. Particularly for large\nmodels, the limited computational and memory resources on a single edge device\ncan become the throughput bottleneck for an inference pipeline. To increase\nthroughput and decrease per-device compute load, we present DEFER (Distributed\nEdge inFERence), a framework for distributed edge inference, which partitions\ndeep neural networks into layers that can be spread across multiple compute\nnodes. The architecture consists of a single \"dispatcher\" node to distribute\nDNN partitions and inference data to respective compute nodes. The compute\nnodes are connected in a series pattern where each node's computed result is\nrelayed to the subsequent node. The result is then returned to the Dispatcher.\nWe quantify the throughput, energy consumption, network payload, and overhead\nfor our framework under realistic network conditions using the CORE network\nemulator. We find that for the ResNet50 model, the inference throughput of\nDEFER with 8 compute nodes is 53% higher and per node energy consumption is 63%\nlower than single device inference.

In this paper, we study how to leverage\nthe partial (or incomplete) information about the topic structure as guidance\nto find out the complete topic taxonomy. We propose a novel framework for topic\ntaxonomy completion, named TaxoCom, which recursively expands the topic\ntaxonomy by discovering novel sub-topic clusters of terms and documents. To\neffectively identify novel topics within a hierarchical topic structure,\nTaxoCom devises its embedding and clustering techniques to be closely-linked\nwith each other: (i) locally discriminative embedding optimizes the text\nembedding space to be discriminative among known (i.e., given) sub-topics, and\n(ii) novelty adaptive clustering assigns terms into either one of the known\nsub-topics or novel sub-topics.

Electronic health records (EHRs), which contain\nheterogeneous patient information, are widely used in disease risk prediction\ntasks. One challenge of applying AI models for risk prediction lies in\ngenerating interpretable evidence to support the prediction results while\nretaining the prediction ability. In order to address this problem, we propose\nthe method of jointly embedding words and labels whereby attention modules\nlearn the weights of words from medical notes according to their relevance to\nthe names of risk prediction labels. This approach boosts interpretability by\nemploying an attention mechanism and including the names of prediction tasks in\nthe model. However, its application is only limited to the handling of textual\ninputs such as medical notes. In this paper, we propose a label dependent\nattention model LDAM to 1) improve the interpretability by exploiting\nClinical-BERT (a biomedical language model pre-trained on a large clinical\ncorpus) to encode biomedically meaningful features and labels jointly; 2)\nextend the idea of joint embedding to the processing of time-series data, and\ndevelop a multi-modal learning framework for integrating heterogeneous\ninformation from medical notes and time-series health status indicators. To\ndemonstrate our method, we apply LDAM to the MIMIC-III dataset to predict\ndifferent disease risks. We evaluate our method both quantitatively and\nqualitatively.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LMs) offer unprecedented language generation\ncapabilities and exciting opportunities for interaction design. However, their\nhighly context-dependent capabilities are difficult to grasp and are often\nsubjectively interpreted. In this paper, we argue that by curating and\nanalyzing large interaction datasets, the HCI community can foster more\nincisive examinations of LMs' generative capabilities. Exemplifying this\napproach, we present CoAuthor, a dataset designed for revealing GPT-3's\ncapabilities in assisting creative and argumentative writing. CoAuthor captures\nrich interactions between 63 writers and four instances of GPT-3 across 1445\nwriting sessions. We demonstrate that CoAuthor can address questions about\nGPT-3's language, ideation, and collaboration capabilities, and reveal its\ncontribution as a writing \"collaborator\" under various definitions of good\ncollaboration. Finally, we discuss how this work may facilitate a more\nprincipled discussion around LMs' promises and pitfalls in relation to\ninteraction design.

Fulfilling their marketing needs and supporting their business\ngrowth is critical to the long-term prosperity of platform economies. However,\ncompared with extensive studies on user modeling such as click-through rate\npredictions, much less attention has been drawn to advertisers, especially in\nterms of understanding their diverse demands and performance. Different from\nuser modeling, advertiser modeling generally involves many kinds of tasks (e.g.\npredictions of advertisers' expenditure, active-rate, or total impressions of\npromoted products). In addition, major e-commerce platforms often provide\nmultiple marketing scenarios (e.g. Sponsored Search, Display Ads, Live\nStreaming Ads) while advertisers' behavior tend to be dispersed among many of\nthem. This raises the necessity of multi-task and multi-scenario consideration\nin comprehensive advertiser modeling, which faces the following challenges:\nFirst, one model per scenario or per task simply doesn't scale; Second, it is\nparticularly hard to model new or minor scenarios with limited data samples;\nThird, inter-scenario correlations are complicated, and may vary given\ndifferent tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multi-scenario\nmulti-task meta learning approach (M2M) which simultaneously predicts multiple\ntasks in multiple advertising scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates sensor scheduling for state estimation of complex\nnetworks over shared transmission channels. For a complex network of dynamical\nsystems, referred to as nodes, a sensor network is adopted to measure and\nestimate the system states in a distributed way, where a sensor is used to\nmeasure a node. The estimates are transmitted from sensors to the associated\nnodes, in the presence of one-step time delay and subject to packet loss. Due\nto limited transmission capability, only a portion of sensors are allowed to\nsend information at each time step. The goal of this paper is to seek an\noptimal sensor scheduling policy minimizing the overall estimation errors.\nUnder a distributed state estimation framework, this problem is reformulated as\na Markov decision process, where the one-stage reward for each node is strongly\ncoupled. The feasibility of the problem reformulation is ensured. In addition,\nan easy-to-check condition is established to guarantee the existence of an\noptimal deterministic and stationary policy. Moreover, it is found that the\noptimal policies have a threshold, which can be used to reduce the\ncomputational complexity in obtaining these policies. Finally, the\neffectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated by several simulation\nexamples.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems provide essential web services by learning users'\npersonal preferences from collected data. However, in many cases, systems also\nneed to forget some training data. From the perspective of privacy, several\nprivacy regulations have recently been proposed, requiring systems to eliminate\nany impact of the data whose owner requests to forget. From the perspective of\nutility, if a system's utility is damaged by some bad data, the system needs to\nforget these data to regain utility. From the perspective of usability, users\ncan delete noise and incorrect entries so that a system can provide more useful\nrecommendations. While unlearning is very important, it has not been\nwell-considered in existing recommender systems. Although there are some\nresearches have studied the problem of machine unlearning in the domains of\nimage and text data, existing methods can not been directly applied to\nrecommendation as they are unable to consider the collaborative information.\nIn this paper, we propose RecEraser, a general and efficient machine\nunlearning framework tailored to recommendation task. The main idea of\nRecEraser is to partition the training set into multiple shards and train a\nconstituent model for each shard. Specifically, to keep the collaborative\ninformation of the data, we first design three novel data partition algorithms\nto divide training data into balanced groups based on their similarity. Then,\nconsidering that different shard models do not uniformly contribute to the\nfinal prediction, we further propose an adaptive aggregation method to improve\nthe global model utility. Experimental results on three public benchmarks show\nthat RecEraser can not only achieve efficient unlearning, but also outperform\nthe state-of-the-art unlearning methods in terms of model utility.

At present, the main paradigm is\ntracking-by-detection, and the main difficulty of this paradigm is how to\nassociate the current candidate detection with the historical tracklets.\nHowever, in the MOT scenarios, each historical tracklet is composed of an\nobject sequence, while each candidate detection is just a flat image, which\nlacks the temporal features of the object sequence. The feature difference\nbetween current candidate detection and historical tracklets makes the object\nassociation much harder. Therefore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Mutual\n{Representation} Learning (STURE) approach which learns spatial-temporal\nrepresentations between current candidate detection and historical sequence in\na mutual representation space. For the historical trackelets, the detection\nlearning network is forced to match the representations of sequence learning\nnetwork in a mutual representation space. The proposed approach is capable of\nextracting more distinguishing detection and sequence representations by using\nvarious designed losses in object association. As a result, spatial-temporal\nfeature is learned mutually to reinforce the current detection features, and\nthe feature difference can be relieved.

Therefore we propose to use updates and\ncomparisons with automatic functions as primitive operations and use constantly\nmany registers; the resulting model covers all primitive operations of\nHartmanis and Simon as well as Floyd and Knuth, but the model remains in\npolynomial time. The present work investigates in particular the deterministic\ncomplexity of various natural problems and also gives an overview on the\nnondeterministic complexity of this model.",

    "abstract": "Landslides are notoriously difficult to predict. Deep neural networks (DNNs)\nmodels are more accurate than statistical models. However, they are\nuninterpretable, making it difficult to extract mechanistic information about\nlandslide controls in the modeled region. We developed an explainable AI (XAI)\nmodel to assess landslide susceptibility that is computationally simple and\nfeatures high accuracy. We validated it on three different regions of eastern\nHimalaya that are highly susceptible to landslides. SNNs are computationally\nmuch simpler than DNNs, yet achieve similar performance while offering insights\nregarding the relative importance of landslide control factors in each region.\nOur analysis highlighted the importance of: 1) the product of slope and\nprecipitation rate and 2) topographic aspects that contribute to high\nsusceptibility in landslide areas. These identified controls suggest that\nstrong slope-climate couplings, along with microclimates, play more dominant\nroles in eastern Himalayan landslides. The model outperforms physically-based\nstability and statistical models.",

Based\non this representation, our TaylorImNet can achieve a significantly faster\ngeneration speed than other baselines.

Existing work of high-level synthesis\n(HLS) performance prediction usually needs extensive feature engineering after\nthe synthesis process. To expedite circuit evaluation from as earlier design\nstage as possible, we propose a rapid and accurate performance modeling,\nexploiting the representation power of graph neural networks (GNNs) by\nrepresenting C/C++ programs as graphs. The contribution of this work is\nthree-fold. First, we build a standard benchmark containing 40k C synthesizable\nprograms, which includes both synthetic programs and three sets of real-world\nHLS benchmarks. Each program is implemented on FPGA to generate ground-truth\nperformance metrics. Second, we formally formulate the HLS performance\nprediction problem on graphs, and propose multiple modeling strategies with\nGNNs that leverage different trade-offs between prediction timeliness\n(early/late prediction) and accuracy. Third, we further propose a novel\nhierarchical GNN that does not sacrifice timeliness but largely improves\nprediction accuracy, significantly outperforming HLS tools. We apply extensive\nevaluations for both synthetic and unseen real-case programs; our proposed\npredictor largely outperforms HLS by up to 40X and excels existing predictors\nby 2X to 5X in terms of resource usage and timing prediction.",

One of its side-effects is the deviation\nof nominal parameters: process, voltage, and temperature. DRAMs are often\nconsidered as the bottleneck of the system as it trades off performance with\ncapacity. With such inherent limitations, further deviation from nominal\nspecifications is undesired. In this paper, we investigate the impact of\nvariations in conventional DRAM devices on the aspects of performance,\nreliability, and energy requirements. Based on this study, we model a\nvariation-aware framework, called VAR-DRAM, targeted for modern-day DRAM\ndevices. It provides enhanced power management by taking variations into\naccount. VAR-DRAM ensures faster execution of programs as it internally remaps\ndata from variation affected cells to normal cells and also ensures data\npreservation. On extensive experimentation, we find that VAR-DRAM achieves peak\nenergy savings of up to 48.8% with an average of 29.54% on DDR4 memories while\nimproving the access latency of the DRAM compared to a variation affected\ndevice by 7.4%.",

    "abstract": "Temperature field inversion of heat-source systems (TFI-HSS) with limited\nobservations is essential to monitor the system health. Although some methods\nsuch as interpolation have been proposed to solve TFI-HSS, those existing\nmethods ignore correlations between data constraints and physics constraints,\ncausing the low precision. In this work, we develop a physics-informed neural\nnetwork-based temperature field inversion (PINN-TFI) method to solve the\nTFI-HSS task and a coefficient matrix condition number based position selection\nof observations (CMCN-PSO) method to select optima positions of noise\nobservations. For the TFI-HSS task, the PINN-TFI method encodes constrain terms\ninto the loss function, thus the task is transformed into an optimization\nproblem of minimizing the loss function. In addition, we have found that noise\nobservations significantly affect reconstruction performances of the PINN-TFI\nmethod. To alleviate the effect of noise observations, the CMCN-PSO method is\nproposed to find optimal positions, where the condition number of observations\nis used to evaluate positions. The results demonstrate that the PINN-TFI method\ncan significantly improve prediction precisions and the CMCN-PSO method can\nfind good positions to acquire a more robust temperature field.",

To\nensure the availability of SFCs, it turns out to be effective to place\nredundant SFC backups at the edge for quickly recovering from any failures. The\nexisting research largely overlooks the influences of SFC popularity, backup\ncompleteness and failure rate on the optimal deployment of SFC backups on edge\nservers. In this paper, we comprehensively consider from the perspectives of\nboth the end users and edge system to backup SFCs for providing popular\nservices with the lowest latency. To overcome the challenges resulted from\nunknown SFC popularity and failure rate, as well as the known system parameter\nconstraints, we take advantage of the online bandit learning technique to cope\nwith the uncertainty issue.

    "abstract": "The prevalence and perniciousness of fake news has been a critical issue on\nthe Internet, which stimulates the development of automatic fake news detection\nin turn. In this paper, we focus on the evidence-based fake news detection,\nwhere several evidences are utilized to probe the veracity of news (i.e., a\nclaim). Most previous methods first employ sequential models to embed the\nsemantic information and then capture the claim-evidence interaction based on\ndifferent attention mechanisms. Despite their effectiveness, they still suffer\nfrom two main weaknesses. Firstly, due to the inherent drawbacks of sequential\nmodels, they fail to integrate the relevant information that is scattered far\napart in evidences for veracity checking. Secondly, they neglect much redundant\ninformation contained in evidences that may be useless or even harmful. To\nsolve these problems, we propose a unified Graph-based sEmantic sTructure\nmining framework, namely GET in short. Specifically, different from the\nexisting work that treats claims and evidences as sequences, we model them as\ngraph-structured data and capture the long-distance semantic dependency among\ndispersed relevant snippets via neighborhood propagation. After obtaining\ncontextual semantic information, our model reduces information redundancy by\nperforming graph structure learning. Finally, the fine-grained semantic\nrepresentations are fed into the downstream claim-evidence interaction module\nfor predictions. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of\nGET over the state-of-the-arts.",

To\naddress this problem, we formulate CTR prediction as a continual learning task\nand propose COLF, a hybrid COntinual Learning Framework for CTR prediction,\nwhich has a memory-based modular architecture that is designed to adapt, learn\nand give predictions continuously when faced with non-stationary drifting click\ndata streams. Married with a memory population method that explicitly controls\nthe discrepancy between memory and target data, COLF is able to gain positive\nknowledge from its historical experience and makes improved CTR predictions.\nEmpirical evaluations on click log collected from a major shopping app in China\ndemonstrate our method's superiority over existing methods.

Learning disentangled representations of\nthe data help to improve robustness and provide control in the sampling\nprocess. For video generation, there is a recent progress in this area by\nconsidering motion and appearance as orthogonal information and designing\narchitectures that efficiently disentangle them. These approaches rely on\nhandcrafting architectures that impose structural priors on the generator to\ndecompose appearance and motion codes in the latent space. Inspired from the\nrecent advancements in the autoencoder based image generation, we present AVLAE\n(Adversarial Video Latent AutoEncoder) which is a two stream latent autoencoder\nwhere the video distribution is learned by adversarial training. In particular,\nwe propose to autoencode the motion and appearance latent vectors of the video\ngenerator in the adversarial setting.

    "abstract": "Deep image matting methods have achieved increasingly better results on\nbenchmarks (e.g., Composition-1k/alphamatting.com). However, the robustness,\nincluding robustness to trimaps and generalization to images from different\ndomains, is still under-explored. Although some works propose to either refine\nthe trimaps or adapt the algorithms to real-world images via extra data\naugmentation, none of them has taken both into consideration, not to mention\nthe significant performance deterioration on benchmarks while using those data\naugmentation. To fill this gap, we propose an image matting method which\nachieves higher robustness (RMat) via multilevel context assembling and strong\ndata augmentation targeting matting. Specifically, we first build a strong\nmatting framework by modeling ample global information with transformer blocks\nin the encoder, and focusing on details in combination with convolution layers\nas well as a low-level feature assembling attention block in the decoder. Then,\nbased on this strong baseline, we analyze current data augmentation and explore\nsimple but effective strong data augmentation to boost the baseline model and\ncontribute a more generalizable matting method. Compared with previous methods,\nthe proposed method not only achieves state-of-the-art results on the\nComposition-1k benchmark (11% improvement on SAD and 27% improvement on Grad)\nwith smaller model size, but also shows more robust generalization results on\nother benchmarks, on real-world images, and also on varying coarse-to-fine\ntrimaps with our extensive experiments.",

We are motivated by a recent line of work that studies\nsolutions that are optimal with respect to notions related to the welfare of\nthe agents. We explore the parameterized complexity of computing such\nsolutions. We focus on the well-studied notions of social welfare (WO) and\nPareto optimality (PO), alongside the recently proposed notions of\ngroup-welfare optimality (GWO) and utility-vector optimality (UVO), both of\nwhich lie between WO and PO. Firstly, we focus on the fundamental case where\n$k=2$ and there are $r$ red agents and $b$ blue agents. We show that all\nsolution-notions we consider are $\\textsf{NP}$-hard to compute even when $b=1$\nand that they are $\\textsf{W}[1]$-hard when parameterized by $r$ and $b$. In\naddition, we show that WO and GWO are $\\textsf{NP}$-hard even on cubic graphs.\nWe complement these negative results by an $\\textsf{FPT}$ algorithm\nparameterized by $r, b$ and the maximum degree of the graph. For the general\ncase with $k$ types of agents, we prove that for any of the notions we consider\nthe problem is $\\textsf{W}[1]$-hard when parameterized by $k$ for a large\nfamily of graphs that includes trees.

Given these possibilities that DT can offer, practitioners are\nfacing increasingly difficult decisions regarding what capabilities to select\nwhile deploying a DT in practice.

It has resulted in the rebranding and reuse of emerging\ntechnological capabilities like prediction, simulation, AI, and Machine\nLearning (ML) as necessary constituents of DT.

To alleviate this challenge, this paper proposes the\ndigitalization framework, designed and developed by following a Design Science\nResearch (DSR) methodology over a period of 18 months. The framework can help\npractitioners select an appropriate level of sophistication in a DT by weighing\nthe pros and cons for each level, deciding evaluation criteria for the digital\ntwin system, and assessing the implications of the selected DT on the\norganizational processes and strategies, and value creation.

    "abstract": "IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is an essential\nrouting protocol to enable communications for IoT networks with low power\ndevices. RPL uses an objective function and routing constraints to find an\noptimized routing path for each node in the network. However, recent research\nhas shown that topological attacks, such as selective forwarding attacks, pose\ngreat challenges to the secure routing of IoT networks. Many conventional\nsecure routing solutions, on the other hand, are computationally heavy to be\ndirectly applied in resource-constrained IoT networks. There is an urgent need\nto develop lightweight secure routing solutions for IoT networks. In this\npaper, we first design and implement a series of advanced selective forwarding\nattacks from the attack perspective, which can flexibly select the type and\npercentage of forwarding packets in an energy efficient way, and even bad-mouth\nother innocent nodes in the network. Experiment results show that the proposed\nattacks can maximize the attack consequences (i.e. number of dropped packets)\nwhile maintaining undetected. Moreover, we propose a lightweight trust-based\ndefense solution to detect and eliminate malicious selective forwarding nodes\nfrom the network. The results show that the proposed defense solution can\nachieve high detection accuracy with very limited extra energy usage (i.e.\n3.4%).",

    "abstract": "In order to develop complex relationships between their inputs and outputs,\ndeep neural networks train and adjust large number of parameters. To make these\nnetworks work at high accuracy, vast amounts of data are needed. Sometimes,\nhowever, the quantity of data needed is not present or obtainable for training.\nNeuron-specific dropout (NSDropout) is a tool to address this problem.\nNSDropout looks at both the training pass, and validation pass, of a layer in a\nmodel. By comparing the average values produced by each neuron for each class\nin a data set, the network is able to drop targeted units. The layer is able to\npredict what features, or noise, the model is looking at during testing that\nisn't present when looking at samples from validation. Unlike dropout, the\n\"thinned\" networks cannot be \"unthinned\" for testing. Neuron-specific dropout\nhas proved to achieve similar, if not better, testing accuracy with far less\ndata than traditional methods including dropout and other regularization\nmethods.

Current approaches for representation distillation\nmainly focus on the direct minimization of distance metrics between the models'\nembedding vectors. Such direct methods may be limited in transferring\nhigh-order dependencies embedded in the representation vectors, or in handling\nthe capacity gap between the teacher and student models. In this paper, we\nintroduce two approaches for enhancing representation distillation using\nclassifier sharing between the teacher and student. Specifically, we first show\nthat connecting the teacher's classifier to the student backbone and freezing\nits parameters is beneficial for the process of representation distillation,\nyielding consistent improvements.

Via\nextensive experiments and analysis, we show the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethods on various datasets and tasks, including image classification,\nfine-grained classification, and face verification.

    "abstract": "The recent pandemic has changed the way we see education. It is not\nsurprising that children and college students are not the only ones using\nonline education. Millions of adults have signed up for online classes and\ncourses during last years, and MOOC providers, such as Coursera or edX, are\nreporting millions of new users signing up in their platforms. However,\nstudents do face some challenges when choosing courses. Though online review\nsystems are standard among many verticals, no standardized or fully\ndecentralized review systems exist in the MOOC ecosystem. In this vein, we\nbelieve that there is an opportunity to leverage available open MOOC reviews in\norder to build simpler and more transparent reviewing systems, allowing users\nto really identify the best courses out there. Specifically, in our research we\nanalyze 2.4 million reviews (which is the largest MOOC reviews dataset used\nuntil now) from five different platforms in order to determine the following:\n(1) if the numeric ratings provide discriminant information to learners, (2) if\nNLP-driven sentiment analysis on textual reviews could provide valuable\ninformation to learners, (3) if we can leverage NLP-driven topic finding\ntechniques to infer themes that could be important for learners, and (4) if we\ncan use these models to effectively characterize MOOCs based on the open\nreviews. Results show that numeric ratings are clearly biased (63\\% of them are\n5-star ratings), and the topic modeling reveals some interesting topics related\nwith course advertisements, the real applicability, or the difficulty of the\ndifferent courses. We expect our study to shed some light on the area and\npromote a more transparent approach in online education reviews, which are\nbecoming more and more popular as we enter the post-pandemic era.",

    "abstract": "This document considers the counteracting requirements of privacy and\naccountability applied to identity management. Based on the requirements of\nGDPR 1 applied to identity attributes two forms of identity, with differing\nbalances between privacy and accountability, are suggested termed\n\"publicly-recognised identity\" and \"domain-specific identity\". These forms of\nidentity can be further refined using \"pseudonymisation\" and as described in\nGDPR. This leads to the different forms of identity on the spectrum of\naccountability vs privacy. It is recommended that the privacy and\naccountability requirements, and hence the appropriate form of identity, is\nconsidered in designing an identification scheme, and in the adoption of a\nscheme by data processing systems. Also, users should be aware of the\nimplications of the form of identity requested by a system so that they can\ndecide whether this is acceptable.",

However, existing works have paid very much attention to\nlearning structures on homogeneous networks while the related study on\nheterogeneous networks is still a void. In this paper, we try to take the first\nstep for representation learning on heterostructures, which is very challenging\ndue to their highly diverse combinations of node types and underlying\nstructures. To effectively distinguish diverse heterostructures, we firstly\npropose a theoretically guaranteed technique called heterogeneous anonymous\nwalk (HAW) and its variant coarse HAW (CHAW). Then, we devise the heterogeneous\nanonymous walk embedding (HAWE) and its variant coarse HAWE in a data-driven\nmanner to circumvent using an extremely large number of possible walks and\ntrain embeddings by predicting occurring walks in the neighborhood of each\nnode. Finally, we design and apply extensive and illustrative experiments on\nsynthetic and real-world networks to build a benchmark on heterostructure\nlearning and evaluate the effectiveness of our methods. The results demonstrate\nour methods achieve outstanding performance compared with both homogeneous and\nheterogeneous classic methods, and can be applied on large-scale networks.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are typically trained in a single shot for a specific\ntask and data distribution, but in real world settings both the task and the\ndomain of application can change. The problem becomes even more challenging in\ndense predictive tasks, such as semantic segmentation, and furthermore most\napproaches tackle the two problems separately. In this paper we introduce the\nnovel task of coarse-to-fine learning of semantic segmentation architectures in\npresence of domain shift. We consider subsequent learning stages progressively\nrefining the task at the semantic level; i.e., the finer set of semantic labels\nat each learning step is hierarchically derived from the coarser set of the\nprevious step. We propose a new approach (CCDA) to tackle this scenario. First,\nwe employ the maximum squares loss to align source and target domains and, at\nthe same time, to balance the gradients between well-classified and harder\nsamples. Second, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine knowledge distillation\nconstraint to transfer network capabilities acquired on a coarser set of labels\nto a set of finer labels. Finally, we design a coarse-to-fine weight\ninitialization rule to spread the importance from each coarse class to the\nrespective finer classes. To evaluate our approach, we design two benchmarks\nwhere source knowledge is extracted from the GTA5 dataset and it is transferred\nto either the Cityscapes or the IDD datasets, and we show how it outperforms\nthe main competitors.",

The equivalence of\ncausal models is then defined in terms of a natural transformation or\nisomorphism between two such functors, which we call a $\\Phi$-abstraction and\n$\\Phi$-equivalence, respectively. It is shown that when one model is a\n$\\Phi$-abstraction of another, the intervention calculus of the former can be\nconsistently translated into that of the latter. We also identify the condition\nunder which a model accommodates a $\\Phi$-abstraction, when transformations are\ndeterministic.",

    "abstract": "Public clouds are one of the most thriving technologies of past decade. Major\napplications over public clouds require world-wide distribution and large\namounts of data exchange between their distributed servers. To that end, major\ncloud providers have invested tens of billions of dollars in building\nworld-wide inter-region networking infrastructure that can support\nhigh-performance communication into, out of, and across public cloud geographic\nregions. In this paper, we lay the foundation for a comprehensive study and\nreal-time monitoring of various characteristics of networking within and\nbetween public clouds. We start by presenting CloudCast, worldwide and\nexpandable measurements and analysis system, currently (January 2019)\ncollecting data from three major public clouds (AWS, GCP and Azure), 59\nregions, 1184 intra-cloud, and 2238 cross-cloud links (each link represents a\ndirect connection between a pair of regions), amounting to a total of 3422\ncontinuously monitored links and providing active measurements every minute.\nCloudCast is composed of measurement agents automatically installed in each\npublic cloud region, centralized control, measurement database, analysis\nengine, and visualization tools. Then we turn to analyze the latency\nmeasurement data collected over almost a year. Our analysis yields surprising\nresults. First, each public cloud exhibits a unique set of link latency\nbehaviors along time. Second, using a novel, fair evaluation methodology,\ntermed similar links, we compare the three clouds. Third, we prove that more\nthan 50% of all links do not provide the optimal RTT through the methodology of\ntriangles. Triangles also provide a framework to get around bottlenecks,\nbenefiting not only the majority (53%-70%) of the cross-cloud links by 30% to\n70%, but also a significant portion (29%-45%) of intra-cloud links by 14%-33%.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a method for the detection of knock occurrences in an\ninternal combustion engine (ICE) using a 1D convolutional neural network\ntrained on in-cylinder pressure data. The model architecture was based on\nconsiderations regarding the expected frequency characteristics of knocking\ncombustion. To aid the feature extraction, all cycles were reduced to 60{\\deg}\nCA long windows, with no further processing applied to the pressure traces. The\nneural networks were trained exclusively on in-cylinder pressure traces from\nmultiple conditions and labels provided by human experts. The best-performing\nmodel architecture achieves an accuracy of above 92% on all test sets in a\ntenfold cross-validation when distinguishing between knocking and non-knocking\ncycles. In a multi-class problem where each cycle was labeled by the number of\nexperts who rated it as knocking, 78% of cycles were labeled perfectly, while\n90% of cycles were classified at most one class from ground truth. They thus\nconsiderably outperform the broadly applied MAPO (Maximum Amplitude of Pressure\nOscillation) detection method, as well as other references reconstructed from\nprevious works. Our analysis indicates that the neural network learned\nphysically meaningful features connected to engine-characteristic resonance\nfrequencies, thus verifying the intended theory-guided data science approach.\nDeeper performance investigation further shows remarkable generalization\nability to unseen operating points. In addition, the model proved to classify\nknocking cycles in unseen engines with increased accuracy of 89% after adapting\nto their features via training on a small number of exclusively non-knocking\ncycles. The algorithm takes below 1 ms (on CPU) to classify individual cycles,\neffectively making it suitable for real-time engine control.",

    "abstract": "We consider performance enhancement of asymmetrically-clipped optical\northogonal frequency division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) and related optical OFDM\nschemes, which are variations of OFDM in intensity-modulated optical wireless\ncommunications. Unlike most existing studies on specific designs of improved\nreceivers, this paper investigates information theoretic limits of all possible\nreceivers. For independent and identically distributed complex Gaussian inputs,\nwe obtain an exact characterization of information rate of ACO-OFDM with\nimproved receivers for all SNRs. It is proved that the high-SNR gain of\nimproved receivers asymptotically achieve 1/4 bits per channel use, which is\nequivalent to 3 dB in electrical SNR or 1.5 dB in optical SNR; as the SNR\ndecreases, the maximum achievable SNR gain of improved receivers decreases\nmonotonically to a non-zero low-SNR limit, corresponding to an information rate\ngain of 36.3%. For practically used constellations, we derive an upper bound on\nthe gain of improved receivers. Numerical results demonstrate that the upper\nbound can be approached to within 1 dB in optical SNR by combining existing\nimproved receivers and coded modulation. We also show that our information\ntheoretic analyses can be extended to Flip-OFDM and PAM-DMT. Our results imply\nthat, for the considered schemes, improved receivers may reduce the gap to\nchannel capacity significantly at low-to-moderate SNR.",

    "abstract": "Process mining bridges the gap between process management and data science by\ndiscovering process models using event logs derived from real-world data.\nBesides mandatory event attributes, additional attributes can be part of an\nevent representing domain data, such as human resources and costs.\nData-enhanced process models provide a visualization of domain data associated\nto process activities directly in the process model, allowing to monitor the\nactual values of domain data in the form of event attribute aggregations.\nHowever, event logs can have so many attributes that it is difficult to decide,\nwhich one is of interest to observe throughout the process. This paper\nintroduces three mechanisms to support domain data selection, allowing process\nanalysts and domain experts to progressively reach their information of\ninterest.

    "abstract": "The study examines the problem of using augmented and virtual reality in the\nprocess of blended learning in general secondary education. The study analyzes\nthe meaning of the concept of \"blended learning\". The conceptual principles of\nblended learning are considered. The definition of augmented and virtual\nreality is given. The mixed reality is considered as a separate kind of notion.\nSeparate applications of virtual and augmented reality that can be used in the\nprocess of blended learning are considered. As a result of the study, the\nauthors propose possible ways to use augmented reality in the educational\nprocess. The model of using augmented and virtual reality in blended learning\nin general secondary education institutions was designed. It consists of the\nfollowing blocks: goal; teacher's activity; forms of education; teaching\nmethods; teaching aids; organizational forms of education; pupil activity and\nresults. Based on the model, the methodology of using augmented and virtual\nreality in blended learning in general secondary education was developed. The\nmethodology contains the following components: target component, content\ncomponent, technological component and resultant component. The methodology is\nquite universal and can be used for any subject in general secondary education.\nThe types of lessons in which it is expedient to use augmented (AR) and virtual\nreality(VR) are determined. Recommendations are given at which stage of the\nlesson it is better to use AR and VR tools (depending on the type of lesson).",

InterpoMAE masks random\npatches from the input time series and restore the missing patches in the\nlatent space by an interpolator. The core design is that InterpoMAE uses an\ninterpolator rather than mask tokens to restore the latent representations for\nmissing patches in the latent space. This design enables more efficient and\neffective capture of temporal dynamics with bidirectional information.\nInterpoMAE allows for explicit control on the diversity of synthetic data by\nchanging the size and number of masked patches. Our approach consistently and\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SoTA) benchmarks of unsupervised\nlearning in time series generation on several real datasets. Synthetic data\nproduced show promising scaling behavior in various downstream tasks such as\ndata augmentation, imputation and denoise.",

    "abstract": "There has been a significant progress in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)\ninputs in neural networks recently, primarily due to the use of large models\npretrained on large datasets, and an emerging use of multi-modality. We show a\nsevere adversarial vulnerability of even the strongest current OOD detection\ntechniques. With a small, targeted perturbation to the input pixels, we can\nchange the image assignment from an in-distribution to an out-distribution, and\nvice versa, easily. In particular, we demonstrate severe adversarial\nvulnerability on the challenging near OOD CIFAR-100 vs CIFAR-10 task, as well\nas on the far OOD CIFAR-100 vs SVHN. We study the adversarial robustness of\nseveral post-processing techniques, including the simple baseline of Maximum of\nSoftmax Probabilities (MSP), the Mahalanobis distance, and the newly proposed\n\\textit{Relative} Mahalanobis distance. By comparing the loss of OOD detection\nperformance at various perturbation strengths, we demonstrate the beneficial\neffect of using ensembles of OOD detectors, and the use of the\n\\textit{Relative} Mahalanobis distance over other post-processing methods. In\naddition, we show that even strong zero-shot OOD detection using CLIP and\nmulti-modality suffers from a severe lack of adversarial robustness as well.\nOur code is available at\nhttps://github.com/stanislavfort/adversaries_to_OOD_detection",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. The\navailability of a robust automated cervical image classification system can\naugment the clinical care provider's limitation in traditional visual\ninspection with acetic acid (VIA). However, there are a wide variety of\ncervical inspection objectives which impact the labeling criteria for\ncriteria-specific prediction model development. Moreover, due to the lack of\nconfirmatory test results and inter-rater labeling variation, many images are\nleft unlabeled.\nMotivated by these challenges, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL)\nbased approach to produce a pre-trained cervix model from unlabeled cervical\nimages. The developed model is further fine-tuned to produce criteria-specific\nclassification models with the available labeled images. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach using two cervical image datasets. Both\ndatasets are partially labeled and labeling criteria are different. The\nexperimental results show that the SSL-based initialization improves\nclassification performance (Accuracy: 2.5% min) and the inclusion of images\nfrom both datasets during SSL further improves the performance (Accuracy: 1.5%\nmin). Further, considering data-sharing restrictions, we experimented with the\neffectiveness of Federated SSL and find that it can improve performance over\nthe SSL model developed with just its images. This justifies the importance of\nSSL-based cervix model development. We believe that the present research shows\na novel direction in developing criteria-specific custom deep models for\ncervical image classification by combining images from different sources\nunlabeled and/or labeled with varying criteria, and addressing image access\nrestrictions.",

To overcome\nthis obstacle, we propose to accelerate state representation learning by\nenforcing view-consistency on the dynamics. Firstly, we introduce a formalism\nof Multi-view Markov Decision Process (MMDP) that incorporates multiple views\nof the state. Following the structure of MMDP, our method, View-Consistent\nDynamics (VCD), learns state representations by training a view-consistent\ndynamics model in the latent space, where views are generated by applying data\naugmentation to states.

A notable drawback of\nthe original DEIM algorithm is that the number of column or row indices that\ncan be selected is limited to the number of input singular vectors. We propose\na new variant of DEIM, which we call L-DEIM, a combination of the strength of\ndeterministic leverage scores and DEIM. This method allows for the selection of\na number of indices greater than the number of available singular vectors.\nSince DEIM requires singular vectors as input matrices, L-DEIM is particularly\nattractive for example in big data problems when computing a rank-$k$-SVD\napproximation is expensive even for moderately small $k$ since it uses a\nlower-rank SVD approximation instead of the full rank-$k$ SVD.

Previous studies validated automatic inference of Python\ndependencies using pre-built knowledge bases.

Specifically, we design a domain-specific ontology\nfor Python third-party packages and construct KGs for over 10,000 popular\npackages in Python 2 and Python 3. PyCRE discovers candidate libraries by\nmeasuring the matching degree between the known libraries and the third-party\nresources used in target code.

Extensive simulated evaluation in comparison\nwith a state-of-the-art alternative methodology, for coverage path planning\n(CPP) operations, establishes the performance gains in terms of achieved\ncoverage and overall duration of the generated missions. On top of that, DARP\nalgorithm is employed to allocate sub-tasks to each member of the swarm, taking\ninto account each UAV's sensing and operational capabilities, their initial\npositions and any no-fly-zones possibly defined inside the operational area.\nThis feature is of paramount importance in real-life applications, as it has\nthe potential to achieve tremendous performance improvements in terms of time\ndemanded to complete a mission, while at the same time it unlocks a wide new\nrange of applications, that was previously not feasible due to the limited\nbattery life of UAVs.

But the approach allows to conveniently extend to general cases,\nincluding inhomogeneous sources and non-constant coefficient differential\noperators. We introduce the method, discuss implementational aspects and\nexplore its potential on a set of standard PDE problems. Compared to standard\ndiscontinuous Galerkin methods we observe a severe reduction of the globally\ncoupled unknowns in all considered cases reducing the corresponding computing\ntime significantly. Moreover, for the Helmholtz problem we even observe an\nimproved accuracy similar to Trefftz discontinuous Galerkin methods based on\nplane waves.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, eXtended Reality (XR) has attracted increasing\ninterest thanks to its extensive industrial and commercial applications, and\nits popularity is expected to rise exponentially over the next decade. However,\nthe stringent Quality of Service (QoS) constraints imposed by XR's interactive\nnature require Network Slicing (NS) solutions to support its use over wireless\nconnections: in this context, quasi-Constant Bit Rate (CBR) encoding is a\npromising solution, as it can increase the predictability of the stream, making\nthe network resource allocation easier. However, traffic characterization of XR\nstreams is still a largely unexplored subject, particularly with this encoding.\nIn this work, we characterize XR streams from more than 4 hours of traces\ncaptured in a real setup, analyzing their temporal correlation and proposing\ntwo prediction models for future frame size. Our results show that even the\nstate-of-the-art H.264 CBR mode can have significant frame size fluctuations,\nwhich can impact the NS optimization. Our proposed prediction models can be\napplied to different traces, and even to different contents, achieving very\nsimilar performance. We also show the trade-off between network resource\nefficiency and XR QoS in a simple NS use case.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic scheduling is an important problem in applications from queuing to\nwireless networks. It addresses how to choose an item among multiple scheduling\nitems in each timestep to achieve a long-term goal. Conventional approaches for\ndynamic scheduling find the optimal policy for a given specific system so that\nthe policy from these approaches is usable only for the corresponding system\ncharacteristics. Hence, it is hard to use such approaches for a practical\nsystem in which system characteristics dynamically change. This paper proposes\na novel policy structure for MDP-based dynamic scheduling, a descriptive\npolicy, which has a system-agnostic capability to adapt to unseen system\ncharacteristics for an identical task (dynamic scheduling). To this end, the\ndescriptive policy learns a system-agnostic scheduling principle--in a\nnutshell, \"which condition of items should have a higher priority in\nscheduling\". The scheduling principle can be applied to any system so that the\ndescriptive policy learned in one system can be used for another system.\nExperiments with simple explanatory and realistic application scenarios\ndemonstrate that it enables system-agnostic meta-learning with very little\nperformance degradation compared with the system-specific conventional\npolicies.",

Compared\nto existing private RL algorithms that work only on tabular finite-state,\nfinite-actions MDPs, we take the first step towards privacy-preserving learning\nin MDPs with large state and action spaces. Specifically, we consider MDPs with\nlinear function approximation (in particular linear mixture MDPs) under the\nnotion of joint differential privacy (JDP), where the RL agent is responsible\nfor protecting users' sensitive data. We design two private RL algorithms that\nare based on value iteration and policy optimization, respectively, and show\nthat they enjoy sub-linear regret performance while guaranteeing privacy\nprotection. Moreover, the regret bounds are independent of the number of\nstates, and scale at most logarithmically with the number of actions, making\nthe algorithms suitable for privacy protection in nowadays large-scale\npersonalized services. Our results are achieved via a general procedure for\nlearning in linear mixture MDPs under changing regularizers, which not only\ngeneralizes previous results for non-private learning, but also serves as a\nbuilding block for general private reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "The recently proposed open-radio access network (O-RAN) architecture embraces\ncloudification and network function virtualization techniques to perform the\nbase-band function processing by dis-aggregated radio units (RUs), distributed\nunits (DUs), and centralized units (CUs). This enables the cloud-RAN vision in\nfull, where mobile network operators (MNOs) could install their own RUs, but\nthen lease on-demand computational resources for the processing of DU and CU\nfunctions from commonly available open-cloud (O-Cloud) servers via open x-haul\ninterfaces due to variation of load over the day. This creates a multi-tenant\nnetwork scenario where multiple MNOs share networking as well as computational\nresources. In this paper, we propose a framework that dynamically allocates\nx-haul and DU/CU resources in a multi-tenant O-RAN ecosystem with max-min\nfairness. This framework ensures that a maximum number of RUs get sufficient\nresources while minimizing the OPEX for their MNOs. Moreover, in order to\nprovide an access network architecture capable of sustaining low-latency and\nhigh capacity between RUs and edge-computing devices, we consider\ntime-wavelength division multiplexed (TWDM) passive optical network (PON)-based\nx-haul interfaces where the PON virtualization technique is used to provide a\ndirect optical connection between end-points. This creates a virtual mesh\ninterconnection among all the nodes such that the RUs can be connected to the\nEdge-Clouds at macro-cell RU locations as well as to the O-Cloud servers at the\ncentral office locations. Furthermore, we analyze the system performance with\nour proposed framework and show that MNOs can operate with a better\ncost-efficiency than uniform resource allocation.",

While methods such as compressive sensing have\ndemonstrated high-resolution image recovery in various settings, there remain\nissues of robustness due to parameter tuning. Moreover, since the recovery is\nlimited to a point estimate, it is impossible to quantify the uncertainty,\nwhich is often desirable. Due to these inherent limitations, a sparse Bayesian\nlearning approach is sometimes adopted to recover a posterior distribution of\nthe unknown. Sparse Bayesian learning assumes that some linear transformation\nof the unknown is sparse.

It has the\nadvantage that it can be used for various types of data acquisitions and prior\ninformation.

This has motivated the DARPA\nSubterranean Challenge, where teams of robots search for objects of interest in\nvarious underground environments. In response, the CERBERUS system-of-systems\nis presented as a unified strategy towards subterranean exploration using\nlegged and flying robots. As primary robots, ANYmal quadruped systems are\ndeployed considering their endurance and potential to traverse challenging\nterrain. For aerial robots, both conventional and collision-tolerant\nmultirotors are utilized to explore spaces too narrow or otherwise unreachable\nby ground systems. Anticipating degraded sensing conditions, a complementary\nmulti-modal sensor fusion approach utilizing camera, LiDAR, and inertial data\nfor resilient robot pose estimation is proposed. Individual robot pose\nestimates are refined by a centralized multi-robot map optimization approach to\nimprove the reported location accuracy of detected objects of interest in the\nDARPA-defined coordinate frame. Furthermore, a unified exploration path\nplanning policy is presented to facilitate the autonomous operation of both\nlegged and aerial robots in complex underground networks. Finally, to enable\ncommunication between the robots and the base station, CERBERUS utilizes a\nground rover with a high-gain antenna and an optical fiber connection to the\nbase station, alongside breadcrumbing of wireless nodes by our legged robots.\nWe report results from the CERBERUS system-of-systems deployment at the DARPA\nSubterranean Challenge Tunnel and Urban Circuits, along with the current\nlimitations and the lessons learned for the benefit of the community.",

Recent advances in this field is made by developing\nthe refinement stage for voxel-based region proposal networks to better strike\nthe balance between accuracy and efficiency. A popular approach among\nstate-of-the-art frameworks is to divide proposals, or Region of Interest\n(ROI), into grids and extract feature for each grid location before\nsynthesizing them to ROI feature.

To get around this issue, recent deep\nInverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods learn rewards directly from the\nraw state but this is challenging because the robot has to implicitly learn the\nfeatures that are important and how to combine them, simultaneously.

The AMC success rate versus SINR, total power consuming, and sum\ncapacity are evaluated for OFDM-NOMA assisted 5G system. Results show\nimprovement of success rate compared of some published method. Furthermore, the\nalgorithm directly computes SINR after signal is detected by successive\ninterference cancellation (SIC) and before any signal decoding. Moreover,\nbecause of the direct sense of physical channel, the presented algorithm can\ndiscount occupied symbols (overhead signaling) for channel quality information\n(CQI) in network communication signaling. The results also prove that the\nproposed algorithm reduces the total power consumption and increases the sum\ncapacity through the eNode B connections. Simulation results in compare to\nother algorithms show more successful AMC, efficient SINR estimator, easier\npractical implantation, less overhead signaling, less power consumption, and\nmore capacity achievement.",

    "abstract": "When faced with changing environment, highly configurable software systems\nneed to dynamically search for promising adaptation plan that keeps the best\npossible performance, e.g., higher throughput or smaller latency -- a typical\nplanning problem for self-adaptive systems (SASs). However, given the rugged\nand complex search landscape with multiple local optima, such a SAS planning is\nchallenging especially in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose\nLiDOS, a lifelong dynamic optimization framework for SAS planning. What makes\nLiDOS unique is that to handle the \"dynamic\", we formulate the SAS planning as\na multi-modal optimization problem, aiming to preserve the useful information\nfor better dealing with the local optima issue under dynamic environment\nchanges. This differs from existing planners in that the \"dynamic\" is not\nexplicitly handled during the search process in planning. As such, the search\nand planning in LiDOS run continuously over the lifetime of SAS, terminating\nonly when it is taken offline or the search space has been covered under an\nenvironment.\nExperimental results on three real-world SASs show that the concept of\nexplicitly handling dynamic as part of the search in the SAS planning is\neffective, as LiDOS outperforms its stationary counterpart overall with up to\n10x improvement. It also achieves better results in general over\nstate-of-the-art planners and with 1.4x to 10x speedup on generating promising\nadaptation plans.",

    "abstract": "Future Event Generation aims to generate fluent and reasonable future event\ndescriptions given preceding events. It requires not only fluent text\ngeneration but also commonsense reasoning to maintain the coherence of the\nentire event story. However, existing FEG methods are easily trapped into\nrepeated or general events without imposing any logical constraint to the\ngeneration process. In this paper, we propose a novel explainable FEG framework\nthat consists of a commonsense inference model (IM) and an event generation\nmodel (GM). The IM, which is pre-trained on a commonsense knowledge graph\nATOMIC, learns to interpret the preceding events and conducts commonsense\nreasoning to reveal the characters psychology such as intent, reaction, and\nneeds as latent variables. GM further takes the commonsense knowledge as\nprompts to guide and enforce the generation of logistically coherent future\nevents. As unique merit, the commonsense prompts can be further decoded into\ntextual descriptions, yielding explanations for the future event. Automatic and\nhuman evaluation demonstrate that our approach can generate more coherent,\nspecific, and logical future events than the strong baselines.",

    "abstract": "Graph analytics attract much attention from both research and industry\ncommunities. Due to the linear time complexity, the $k$-core decomposition is\nwidely used in many real-world applications such as biology, social networks,\ncommunity detection, ecology, and information spreading. In many such\napplications, the data graphs continuously change over time. The changes\ncorrespond to edge insertion and removal. Instead of recomputing the $k$-core,\nwhich is time-consuming, we study how to maintain the $k$-core efficiently.\nThat is, when inserting or deleting an edge, we need to identify the affected\nvertices by searching for more vertices. The state-of-the-art order-based\nmethod maintains an order, the so-called $k$-order, among all vertices, which\ncan significantly reduce the searching space. However, this order-based method\nis complicated for understanding and implementation, and its correctness is not\nformally discussed. In this work, we propose a simplified order-based approach\nby introducing the classical Order Data Structure to maintain the $k$-order,\nwhich significantly improves the worst-case time complexity for both edge\ninsertion and removal algorithms. Also, our simplified method is intuitive to\nunderstand and implement; it is easy to argue the correctness formally.\nAdditionally, we discuss a simplified batch insertion approach. The experiments\nevaluate our simplified method over 12 real and synthetic graphs with billions\nof vertices. Compared with the existing method, our simplified approach\nachieves high speedups up to 7.7x and 9.7x for edge insertion and removal,\nrespectively.",

Most segmentation methods,\nhowever, simply model a mapping from an image to its single segmentation map\nand do not take the disagreement of annotators into consideration. In order to\naccount for inter-observer variability, without sacrificing accuracy, we\npropose a novel variational inference framework to model the distribution of\nplausible segmentation maps, given a specific MR image, which explicitly\nrepresents the multi-reader variability.

In this paper, we focus on\ncollective estimation as an example of collective decision-making. The task is\nto estimate the average scalar intensity of a desired feature in the\nenvironment. The solution we propose consists of exploration and exploitation\nphases, where the switching time is a factor dictating the balance between the\ntwo phases. By decomposing the total accuracy into bias and variance, we\nexplain that diversity and social interactions could promote the accuracy of\nthe collective decision. We also show how the exploration-vs-exploitation\ntradeoff relates to the speed-vs-accuracy tradeoff. One significant finding of\nour work is that there is an optimal duration for exploration to compromise\nbetween speed and accuracy. This duration cannot be determined offline for an\nunknown environment. Hence, we propose an adaptive, distributed mechanism\nenabling individual agents to decide in a decentralized manner when to switch.\nMoreover, the spatial consequence of the exploitation phase is an emergent\ncollective movement, leading to the aggregation of the collective at the\niso-contours of the mean intensity of the environmental field in the spatial\ndomain.

However, a task may contain quite\ndiverse samples in which some are easy and others are difficult, and diverse\nprompts are desirable. In this paper, we propose an instance-aware prompt\nlearning method that learns a different prompt for each instance.

    "abstract": "One of the most pressing challenges for the detection of face-manipulated\nvideos is generalising to forgery methods not seen during training while\nremaining effective under common corruptions such as compression. In this\npaper, we question whether we can tackle this issue by harnessing videos of\nreal talking faces, which contain rich information on natural facial appearance\nand behaviour and are readily available in large quantities online. Our method,\ntermed RealForensics, consists of two stages. First, we exploit the natural\ncorrespondence between the visual and auditory modalities in real videos to\nlearn, in a self-supervised cross-modal manner, temporally dense video\nrepresentations that capture factors such as facial movements, expression, and\nidentity. Second, we use these learned representations as targets to be\npredicted by our forgery detector along with the usual binary forgery\nclassification task; this encourages it to base its real/fake decision on said\nfactors. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on\ncross-manipulation generalisation and robustness experiments, and examine the\nfactors that contribute to its performance. Our results suggest that leveraging\nnatural and unlabelled videos is a promising direction for the development of\nmore robust face forgery detectors.",

    "abstract": "In online marketing, the advertisers' goal is usually a tradeoff between\nachieving high volumes and high profitability. The companies' business units\ncustomarily address this tradeoff by maximizing the volumes while guaranteeing\na lower bound to the Return On Investment (ROI). This paper investigates\ncombinatorial bandit algorithms for the bid optimization of advertising\ncampaigns subject to uncertain budget and ROI constraints. We study the nature\nof both the optimization and learning problems. In particular, when focusing on\nthe optimization problem without uncertainty, we show that it is inapproximable\nwithin any factor unless P=NP, and we provide a pseudo-polynomial-time\nalgorithm that achieves an optimal solution. When considering uncertainty, we\nprove that no online learning algorithm can violate the (ROI or budget)\nconstraints during the learning process a sublinear number of times while\nguaranteeing a sublinear pseudo-regret. Thus, we provide an algorithm, namely\nGCB, guaranteeing sublinear regret at the cost of a potentially linear number\nof constraints violations. We also design its safe version, namely GCB_{safe},\nguaranteeing w.h.p. a constant upper bound on the number of constraints\nviolations at the cost of a linear pseudo-regret. More interestingly, we\nprovide an algorithm, namely GCB_{safe}(\\psi,\\phi), guaranteeing both sublinear\npseudo-regret and safety w.h.p. at the cost of accepting tolerances \\psi and\n\\phi in the satisfaction of the ROI and budget constraints, respectively. This\nalgorithm actually mitigates the risks due to the constraints violations\nwithout precluding the convergence to the optimal solution. Finally, we\nexperimentally compare our algorithms in terms of\npseudo-regret/constraint-violation tradeoff in settings generated from\nreal-world data, showing the importance of adopting safety constraints in\npractice and the effectiveness of our algorithms.",

While a rich\ntopic of study in other areas, governance of blockchain platforms is lacking a\nwell established set of methods and practices that are adopted industry wide.\nThis makes the topic of blockchain governance a fertile domain for a thorough\nsystematization that we undertake in this work.\nWe start by distilling a comprehensive array of properties for sound\ngovernance systems drawn from academic sources as well as grey literature of\nelection systems and blockchain white papers.

It consists in learning a model on a small amount of annotated\ndata (annotation budget) and in choosing the best set of points to annotate in\norder to improve the previous model and gain in generalization. In deep\nlearning, active learning is usually implemented as an iterative process in\nwhich successive deep models are updated via fine tuning, but it still poses\nsome issues. First, the initial batch of annotated images has to be\nsufficiently large to train a deep model. Such an assumption is strong,\nespecially when the total annotation budget is reduced. We tackle this issue by\nusing an approach inspired by transfer learning. A pre-trained model is used as\na feature extractor and only shallow classifiers are learned during the active\niterations. The second issue is the effectiveness of probability or feature\nestimates of early models for AL task. Samples are generally selected for\nannotation using acquisition functions based only on the last learned model. We\nintroduce a novel acquisition function which exploits the iterative nature of\nAL process to select samples in a more robust fashion. Samples for which there\nis a maximum shift towards uncertainty between the last two learned models\npredictions are favored. A diversification step is added to select samples from\ndifferent regions of the classification space and thus introduces a\nrepresentativeness component in our approach.

    "title": "Emergent Instabilities in Algorithmic Feedback Loops",
    "abstract": "Algorithms that aid human tasks, such as recommendation systems, are\nubiquitous. They appear in everything from social media to streaming videos to\nonline shopping. However, the feedback loop between people and algorithms is\npoorly understood and can amplify cognitive and social biases (algorithmic\nconfounding), leading to unexpected outcomes. In this work, we explore\nalgorithmic confounding in collaborative filtering-based recommendation\nalgorithms through teacher-student learning simulations. Namely, a student\ncollaborative filtering-based model, trained on simulated choices, is used by\nthe recommendation algorithm to recommend items to agents. Agents might choose\nsome of these items, according to an underlying teacher model, with new choices\nthen fed back into the student model as new training data (approximating online\nmachine learning). These simulations demonstrate how algorithmic confounding\nproduces erroneous recommendations which in turn lead to instability, i.e.,\nwide variations in an item's popularity between each simulation realization. We\nuse the simulations to demonstrate a novel approach to training collaborative\nfiltering models that can create more stable and accurate recommendations. Our\nmethodology is general enough that it can be extended to other socio-technical\nsystems in order to better quantify and improve the stability of algorithms.\nThese results highlight the need to account for emergent behaviors from\ninteractions between people and algorithms.",

    "title": "Minimax Optimality (Probably) Doesn't Imply Distribution Learning for  GANs",
    "abstract": "Arguably the most fundamental question in the theory of generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) is to understand to what extent GANs can actually\nlearn the underlying distribution. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests\nlocal optimality of the empirical training objective is insufficient. Yet, it\ndoes not rule out the possibility that achieving a true population minimax\noptimal solution might imply distribution learning.\nIn this paper, we show that standard cryptographic assumptions imply that\nthis stronger condition is still insufficient. Namely, we show that if local\npseudorandom generators (PRGs) exist, then for a large family of natural\ncontinuous target distributions, there are ReLU network generators of constant\ndepth and polynomial size which take Gaussian random seeds so that (i) the\noutput is far in Wasserstein distance from the target distribution, but (ii) no\npolynomially large Lipschitz discriminator ReLU network can detect this. This\nimplies that even achieving a population minimax optimal solution to the\nWasserstein GAN objective is likely insufficient for distribution learning in\nthe usual statistical sense. Our techniques reveal a deep connection between\nGANs and PRGs, which we believe will lead to further insights into the\ncomputational landscape of GANs.",

    "abstract": "Can world knowledge learned by large language models (LLMs) be used to act in\ninteractive environments? In this paper, we investigate the possibility of\ngrounding high-level tasks, expressed in natural language (e.g. \"make\nbreakfast\"), to a chosen set of actionable steps (e.g. \"open fridge\"). While\nprior work focused on learning from explicit step-by-step examples of how to\nact, we surprisingly find that if pre-trained LMs are large enough and prompted\nappropriately, they can effectively decompose high-level tasks into low-level\nplans without any further training. However, the plans produced naively by LLMs\noften cannot map precisely to admissible actions. We propose a procedure that\nconditions on existing demonstrations and semantically translates the plans to\nadmissible actions. Our evaluation in the recent VirtualHome environment shows\nthat the resulting method substantially improves executability over the LLM\nbaseline. The conducted human evaluation reveals a trade-off between\nexecutability and correctness but shows a promising sign towards extracting\nactionable knowledge from language models.

    "abstract": "While recent automatic speech recognition systems achieve remarkable\nperformance when large amounts of adequate, high quality annotated speech data\nis used for training, the same systems often only achieve an unsatisfactory\nresult for tasks in domains that greatly deviate from the conditions\nrepresented by the training data. For many real-world applications, there is a\nlack of sufficient data that can be directly used for training robust speech\nrecognition systems. To address this issue, we propose and investigate an\napproach that performs a robust acoustic model adaption to a target domain in a\ncross-lingual, multi-staged manner. Our approach enables the exploitation of\nlarge-scale training data from other domains in both the same and other\nlanguages. We evaluate our approach using the challenging task of German oral\nhistory interviews, where we achieve a relative reduction of the word error\nrate by more than 30% compared to a model trained from scratch only on the\ntarget domain, and 6-7% relative compared to a model trained robustly on 1000\nhours of same-language out-of-domain training data.",

    "abstract": "Limited amount of labelled training data are a common problem in medical\nimaging. This makes it difficult to train a well-generalised model and\ntherefore often leads to failure in unknown domains. Hippocampus segmentation\nfrom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans is critical for the diagnosis and\ntreatment of neuropsychatric disorders. Domain differences in contrast or shape\ncan significantly affect segmentation. We address this issue by disentangling a\nT1-weighted MRI image into its content and domain. This separation enables us\nto perform a domain transfer and thus convert data from new sources into the\ntraining domain. This step thus simplifies the segmentation problem, resulting\nin higher quality segmentations. We achieve the disentanglement with the\nproposed novel methodology 'Content Domain Disentanglement GAN', and we propose\nto retrain the UNet on the transformed outputs to deal with GAN-specific\nartefacts. With these changes, we are able to improve performance on unseen\ndomains by 6-13% and outperform state-of-the-art domain transfer methods.",

However, standard DTI\nestimation methods depend on a large number of high-quality measurements. This\nwould require long scan times and can be particularly difficult to achieve with\ncertain patient populations such as neonates. Here, we propose a method that\ncan accurately estimate the diffusion tensor from only six diffusion-weighted\nmeasurements. Our method achieves this by learning to exploit the relationships\nbetween the diffusion signals and tensors in neighboring voxels. Our model is\nbased on transformer networks, which represent the state of the art in modeling\nthe relationship between signals in a sequence. In particular, our model\nconsists of two such networks. The first network estimates the diffusion tensor\nbased on the diffusion signals in a neighborhood of voxels. The second network\nprovides more accurate tensor estimations by learning the relationships between\nthe diffusion signals as well as the tensors estimated by the first network in\nneighboring voxels. Our experiments with three datasets show that our proposed\nmethod achieves highly accurate estimations of the diffusion tensor and is\nsignificantly superior to three competing methods. Estimations produced by our\nmethod with six measurements are comparable with those of standard estimation\nmethods with 30-88 measurements.

The involved\nvariance metric concerns reward variability during the whole process, and\nfuture deviations are discounted to their present values. This discounted\nmean-variance optimization yields a reward function dependent on a discounted\nmean, and this dependency renders traditional dynamic programming methods\ninapplicable since it suppresses a crucial property -- time consistency. To\ndeal with this unorthodox problem, we introduce a pseudo mean to transform the\nuntreatable MDP to a standard one with a redefined reward function in standard\nform and derive a discounted mean-variance performance difference formula. With\nthe pseudo mean, we propose a unified algorithm framework with a bilevel\noptimization structure for the discounted mean-variance optimization.

Furthermore, the convergence\nanalyses missing from the literature can be complemented with the proposed\nframework as well. Taking the value iteration as an example, we develop a\ndiscounted mean-variance value iteration algorithm and prove its convergence to\na local optimum with the aid of a Bellman local-optimality equation.

However, there is currently a lack of a\ngeneral MPNN framework for directly predicting the tensor properties of the\ncrystals. In this work, a general framework for the prediction of tensor\nproperties was proposed: the tensor property of a crystal can be decomposed\ninto the average of the tensor contributions of all the atoms in the crystal,\nand the tensor contribution of each atom can be expanded as the sum of the\ntensor projections in the directions of the edges connecting the atoms. On this\nbasis, the edge-based expansions of force vectors, Born effective charges\n(BECs), dielectric (DL) and piezoelectric (PZ) tensors were proposed. These\nexpansions are rotationally equivariant, while the coefficients in these tensor\nexpansions are rotationally invariant scalars which are similar to physical\nquantities such as formation energy and band gap. The advantage of this tensor\nprediction framework is that it does not require the network itself to be\nequivariant. Therefore, in this work, we directly designed the edge-based\ntensor prediction graph neural network (ETGNN) model on the basis of the\ninvariant graph neural network to predict tensors. The validity and high\nprecision of this tensor prediction framework were shown by the tests of ETGNN\non the extended systems, random perturbed structures and JARVIS-DFT datasets.\nThis tensor prediction framework is general for nearly all the GNNs and can\nachieve higher accuracy with more advanced GNNs in the future.",

    "title": "Two-Stage is Enough: A Concise Deep Unfolding Reconstruction Network for  Flexible Video Compressive Sensing",
    "abstract": "We consider the reconstruction problem of video compressive sensing (VCS)\nunder the deep unfolding/rolling structure. Yet, we aim to build a flexible and\nconcise model using minimum stages. Different from existing deep unfolding\nnetworks used for inverse problems, where more stages are used for higher\nperformance but without flexibility to different masks and scales, hereby we\nshow that a 2-stage deep unfolding network can lead to the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) results (with a 1.7dB gain in PSNR over the single stage model, RevSCI)\nin VCS. The proposed method possesses the properties of adaptation to new masks\nand ready to scale to large data without any additional training thanks to the\nadvantages of deep unfolding. Furthermore, we extend the proposed model for\ncolor VCS to perform joint reconstruction and demosaicing. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our 2-stage model has also achieved SOTA on color VCS\nreconstruction, leading to a >2.3dB gain in PSNR over the previous SOTA\nalgorithm based on plug-and-play framework, meanwhile speeds up the\nreconstruction by >17 times. In addition, we have found that our network is\nalso flexible to the mask modulation and scale size for color VCS\nreconstruction so that a single trained network can be applied to different\nhardware systems. The code and models will be released to the public.",

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid progress of automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies\nin the past few decades, recognition of disordered speech remains a highly\nchallenging task to date. Disordered speech presents a wide spectrum of\nchallenges to current data intensive deep neural networks (DNNs) based ASR\ntechnologies that predominantly target normal speech. This paper presents\nrecent research efforts at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) to\nimprove the performance of disordered speech recognition systems on the largest\npublicly available UASpeech dysarthric speech corpus. A set of novel modelling\ntechniques including neural architectural search, data augmentation using\nspectra-temporal perturbation, model based speaker adaptation and cross-domain\ngeneration of visual features within an audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR)\nsystem framework were employed to address the above challenges. The combination\nof these techniques produced the lowest published word error rate (WER) of\n25.21% on the UASpeech test set 16 dysarthric speakers, and an overall WER\nreduction of 5.4% absolute (17.6% relative) over the CUHK 2018 dysarthric\nspeech recognition system featuring a 6-way DNN system combination and cross\nadaptation of out-of-domain normal speech data trained systems. Bayesian model\nadaptation further allows rapid adaptation to individual dysarthric speakers to\nbe performed using as little as 3.06 seconds of speech. The efficacy of these\ntechniques were further demonstrated on a CUDYS Cantonese dysarthric speech\nrecognition task.",

In more serious cases, death may occur as a result of infection.\nCOVID19 emerged as a pandemic that affected the whole world in a little while.\nThe most important issue in the fight against the epidemic is the early\ndiagnosis and follow-up of COVID19 (+) patients. Therefore, in addition to the\nRT-PCR test, medical imaging methods are also used when identifying COVID 19\n(+) patients.

The\nperformances of z-normalization and min-max normalization methods were\ninvestigated on these data. All features were obtained using discrete wavelet\ntransform method.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is a common brain malignancy that tends to occur in older adults\nand is almost always lethal. The effectiveness of chemotherapy, being the\nstandard treatment for most cancer types, can be improved if a particular\ngenetic sequence in the tumor known as MGMT promoter is methylated. However, to\nidentify the state of the MGMT promoter, the conventional approach is to\nperform a biopsy for genetic analysis, which is time and effort consuming. A\ncouple of recent publications proposed a connection between the MGMT promoter\nstate and the MRI scans of the tumor and hence suggested the use of deep\nlearning models for this purpose. Therefore, in this work, we use one of the\nmost extensive datasets, BraTS 2021, to study the potency of employing deep\nlearning solutions, including 2D and 3D CNN models and vision transformers.\nAfter conducting a thorough analysis of the models' performance, we concluded\nthat there seems to be no connection between the MRI scans and the state of the\nMGMT promoter.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian methods to solve imaging inverse problems usually combine an\nexplicit data likelihood function with a prior distribution that explicitly\nmodels expected properties of the solution. Many kinds of priors have been\nexplored in the literature, from simple ones expressing local properties to\nmore involved ones exploiting image redundancy at a non-local scale. In a\ndeparture from explicit modelling, several recent works have proposed and\nstudied the use of implicit priors defined by an image denoising algorithm.\nThis approach, commonly known as Plug & Play (PnP) regularisation, can deliver\nremarkably accurate results, particularly when combined with state-of-the-art\ndenoisers based on convolutional neural networks. However, the theoretical\nanalysis of PnP Bayesian models and algorithms is difficult and works on the\ntopic often rely on unrealistic assumptions on the properties of the image\ndenoiser. This papers studies maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation for\nBayesian models with PnP priors. We first consider questions related to\nexistence, stability and well-posedness, and then present a convergence proof\nfor MAP computation by PnP stochastic gradient descent (PnP-SGD) under\nrealistic assumptions on the denoiser used.

    "abstract": "Quantitative UltraSound (QUS) aims to reveal information about the tissue\nmicrostructure using backscattered echo signals from clinical scanners. Among\ndifferent QUS parameters, scatterer number density is an important property\nthat can affect estimation of other QUS parameters. Scatterer number density\ncan be classified into high or low scatterer densities. If there are more than\n10 scatterers inside the resolution cell, the envelope data is considered as\nFully Developed Speckle (FDS) and otherwise, as Under Developed Speckle (UDS).\nIn conventional methods, the envelope data is divided into small overlapping\nwindows (a strategy here we refer to as patching), and statistical parameters\nsuch as SNR and skewness are employed to classify each patch of envelope data.\nHowever, these parameters are system dependent meaning that their distribution\ncan change by the imaging settings and patch size. Therefore, reference\nphantoms which have known scatterer number density are imaged with the same\nimaging settings to mitigate system dependency. In this paper, we aim to\nsegment regions of ultrasound data without any patching. A large dataset is\ngenerated which has different shapes of scatterer number density and mean\nscatterer amplitude using a fast simulation method. We employ a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) for the segmentation task and investigate the effect of\ndomain shift when the network is tested on different datasets with different\nimaging settings. Nakagami parametric image is employed for the multi-task\nlearning to improve the performance. Furthermore, inspired by the reference\nphantom methods in QUS, A domain adaptation stage is proposed which requires\nonly two frames of data from FDS and UDS classes. We evaluate our method for\ndifferent experimental phantoms and in vivo data.",

We recast the\n$Q$-function estimation into a special form of the nonparametric instrumental\nvariables (NPIV) estimation problem. We first show that under one mild\ncondition the NPIV formulation of $Q$-function estimation is well-posed in the\nsense of $L^2$-measure of ill-posedness with respect to the data generating\ndistribution, bypassing a strong assumption on the discount factor $\\gamma$\nimposed in the recent literature for obtaining the $L^2$ convergence rates of\nvarious $Q$-function estimators. Thanks to this new well-posed property, we\nderive the first minimax lower bounds for the convergence rates of\nnonparametric estimation of $Q$-function and its derivatives in both sup-norm\nand $L^2$-norm, which are shown to be the same as those for the classical\nnonparametric regression (Stone, 1982). We then propose a sieve two-stage least\nsquares estimator and establish its rate-optimality in both norms under some\nmild conditions. Our general results on the well-posedness and the minimax\nlower bounds are of independent interest to study not only other nonparametric\nestimators for $Q$-function but also efficient estimation on the value of any\ntarget policy in off-policy settings.",

    "abstract": "The ability to adapt medical image segmentation networks for a novel class\nsuch as an unseen anatomical or pathological structure, when only a few\nlabelled examples of this class are available from local healthcare providers,\nis sought-after. This potentially addresses two widely recognised limitations\nin deploying modern deep learning models to clinical practice,\nexpertise-and-labour-intensive labelling and cross-institution generalisation.\nThis work presents the first 3D few-shot interclass segmentation network for\nmedical images, using a labelled multi-institution dataset from prostate cancer\npatients with eight regions of interest. We propose an image alignment module\nregistering the predicted segmentation of both query and support data, in a\nstandard prototypical learning algorithm, to a reference atlas space. The\nbuilt-in registration mechanism can effectively utilise the prior knowledge of\nconsistent anatomy between subjects, regardless whether they are from the same\ninstitution or not. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed\nregistration-assisted prototypical learning significantly improved segmentation\naccuracy (p-values<0.01) on query data from a holdout institution, with varying\navailability of support data from multiple institutions. We also report the\nadditional benefits of the proposed 3D networks with 75% fewer parameters and\nan arguably simpler implementation, compared with existing 2D few-shot\napproaches that segment 2D slices of volumetric medical images.",

In this paper we minimize the execution time (the depth) for a class\nof circuits referred to as linear reversible circuits, which has many\napplications in quantum computing (e.g., stabilizer circuits, CNOT+T circuits,\netc.). We propose a practical formulation of a divide and conquer algorithm\nthat produces quantum circuits that are twice as shallow as those produced by\nexisting algorithms. We improve the theoretical upper bound of the depth in the\nworst case for some range of qubits. We also propose greedy algorithms based on\ncost minimization to find more optimal circuits for small or simple operators.\nOverall, we manage to consistently reduce the total depth of a class of\nreversible functions, with up to 92% savings in an ancilla-free case and up to\n99% when ancillary qubits are available.",

Furthermore, the generative adversarial networks (GAN) is\napplied to the super-resolution field, which effectively improves the visual\nquality of the reconstructed image. However, under the condtion of high\nupscaling factors, the excessive abnormal reasoning of the network produces\nsome distorted structures, so that there is a certain deviation between the\nreconstructed image and the ground-truth image.

Due to the complementary property between the VGG features and\nthe ResNet features, the proposed DP Loss considers the advantages of learning\ntwo features simultaneously, which significantly improves the reconstruction\neffect of images.

We extend\nthis into a fully Bayesian framework which allows quantifying the uncertainty\nof physical parameters and model predictions.

As most\nphysical models, the Windkessel model is an imperfect description of the real\nprocess. To demonstrate our approach we simulate noisy data from a more complex\nphysical model with known mathematical connections to our modeling choice.

Instead, boundaries are represented using a signed distance\nmetric and neural implicit framework. We utilize `analysis-by-synthesis' to\nidentify a solution consistent with the acquired sinogram as well as spatial\nand temporal consistency constraints. We illustrate the utility of NeuralCT in\nthree progressively more complex scenarios: translation of a small circle,\nheartbeat-like change in an ellipse's diameter, and complex topological\ndeformation.

The structure is ideal for\nautomated network-based modeling since it is invariant under power-conserving\ninterconnection, congruence transformations, and Galerkin projection. Moreover,\nstability and passivity properties are easily shown. Condensed forms under\northogonal transformations present easy analysis tools for existence,\nuniqueness, regularity, and numerical methods to check these properties.\nAfter recalling the concepts for general linear and nonlinear descriptor\nsystems, we demonstrate that many difficulties that arise in general descriptor\nsystems can be easily overcome within the port-Hamiltonian framework. The\nproperties of port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems are analyzed,\ntime-discretization, and numerical linear algebra techniques are discussed.\nStructure-preserving regularization procedures for descriptor systems are\npresented to make them suitable for simulation and control. Model reduction\ntechniques that preserve the structure and stabilization and optimal control\ntechniques are discussed.\nThe properties of port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems and their use in\nmodeling simulation and control methods are illustrated with several examples\nfrom different physical domains. The survey concludes with open problems and\nresearch topics that deserve further attention.",

    "abstract": "In image denoising problems, the increasing density of available images makes\nan exhaustive visual inspection impossible and therefore automated methods\nbased on machine-learning must be deployed for this purpose. This is\nparticulary the case in seismic signal processing. Engineers/geophysicists have\nto deal with millions of seismic time series. Finding the sub-surface\nproperties useful for the oil industry may take up to a year and is very costly\nin terms of computing/human resources. In particular, the data must go through\ndifferent steps of noise attenuation. Each denoise step is then ideally\nfollowed by a quality control (QC) stage performed by means of human expertise.\nTo learn a quality control classifier in a supervised manner, labeled training\ndata must be available, but collecting the labels from human experts is\nextremely time-consuming. We therefore propose a novel active learning\nmethodology to sequentially select the most relevant data, which are then given\nback to a human expert for labeling. Beyond the application in geophysics, the\ntechnique we promote in this paper, based on estimates of the local error and\nits uncertainty, is generic. Its performance is supported by strong empirical\nevidence, as illustrated by the numerical experiments presented in this\narticle, where it is compared to alternative active learning strategies both on\nsynthetic and real seismic datasets.",

The proposed network architecture relies on the\nattention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory\n(LSTM) cells. To construct the low-dimensional learning model, we employ a\ndenoising-based convolutional autoencoder from the full-order snapshots given\nby time-dependent hyperbolic partial differential equations for wave\npropagation. To begin, we attempt to address the difficulty in evolving the\nlow-dimensional representation in time with a plain RNN-LSTM for wave\npropagation phenomenon. We build an attention-based sequence-to-sequence\nRNN-LSTM architecture to predict the solution over a long time horizon. To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed learning model, we consider three\nbenchmark problems namely one-dimensional linear convection, nonlinear viscous\nBurgers, and two-dimensional Saint-Venant shallow water system. Using the\ntime-series datasets from the benchmark problems, our novel AB-CRAN\narchitecture accurately captures the wave amplitude and preserves the wave\ncharacteristics of the solution for long time horizons. The attention-based\nsequence-to-sequence network increases the time-horizon of prediction by five\ntimes compared to the plain RNN-LSTM.

A failure to integrate equity into resilience\nconsiderations results in unequal recovery and disproportionate impacts on\nvulnerable populations, which has long been a concern in the United States.\nThis research investigated aspects of equity related to community resilience in\nthe aftermath of Winter Storm Uri in Texas which led to extended power outages\nfor more than 4 million households. County level outage and recovery data was\nanalyzed to explore potential significant links between various county\nattributes and their share of the outages during the recovery and restoration\nphases. Next, satellite imagery was used to examine data at a much higher\ngeographical resolution focusing on census tracts in the city of Houston. The\ngoal was to use computer vision to extract the extent of outages within census\ntracts and investigate their linkages to census tracts attributes. Results from\nvarious statistical procedures revealed statistically significant negative\nassociations between counties' percentage of non-Hispanic whites and median\nhousehold income with the ratio of outages. Additionally, at census tract\nlevel, variables including percentages of linguistically isolated population\nand public transport users exhibited positive associations with the group of\ncensus tracts that were affected by the outage as detected by computer vision\nanalysis. Informed by these results, engineering solutions such as the\napplicability of grid modernization technologies, together with distributed and\nrenewable energy resources, when controlled for the region's topographical\ncharacteristics, are proposed to enhance equitable power grid resiliency in the\nface of natural hazards.",

    "abstract": "It is challenging to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance\nin noisy conditions with single-channel speech enhancement (SE). In this paper,\nwe investigate the causes of ASR performance degradation by decomposing the SE\nerrors using orthogonal projection-based decomposition (OPD). OPD decomposes\nthe SE errors into noise and artifact components. The artifact component is\ndefined as the SE error signal that cannot be represented as a linear\ncombination of speech and noise sources. We propose manually scaling the error\ncomponents to analyze their impact on ASR. We experimentally identify the\nartifact component as the main cause of performance degradation, and we find\nthat mitigating the artifact can greatly improve ASR performance. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate that the simple observation adding (OA) technique (i.e., adding\na scaled version of the observed signal to the enhanced speech) can\nmonotonically increase the signal-to-artifact ratio under a mild condition.\nAccordingly, we experimentally confirm that OA improves ASR performance for\nboth simulated and real recordings. The findings of this paper provide a better\nunderstanding of the influence of SE errors on ASR and open the door to future\nresearch on novel approaches for designing effective single-channel SE\nfront-ends for ASR.",

In this work, we\nconsider an intermediate case of regular motion in a non-integrable system: the\nbehaviour of objects in the 2:3 mean motion resonance with Neptune. We show\nthat, given initial data from a short 6250 yr numerical integration, the\nbest-trained artificial neural network (ANN) can predict the trajectories of\nthe 2:3 resonators over the subsequent 18750 yr evolution, covering a full\nlibration cycle over the combined time period. By comparing our ANN's\nprediction of the resonant angle to the outcome of numerical integrations, the\nformer can predict the resonant angle with an accuracy as small as of a few\ndegrees only, while it has the advantage of considerably saving computational\ntime. More specifically, the trained ANN can effectively measure the resonant\namplitudes of the 2:3 resonators, and thus provides a fast approach that can\nidentify the resonant candidates.

Sentiment analysis and emotion recognition\ncan help capture, categorize and make these different facets searchable. In\nparticular, for oral history archives, such indexing technologies can be of\ngreat interest. These technologies can help understand the role of emotions in\nhistorical remembering. However, humans often perceive sentiments and emotions\nambiguously and subjectively. Moreover, oral history interviews have\nmulti-layered levels of complex, sometimes contradictory, sometimes very subtle\nfacets of emotions. Therefore, the question arises of the chance machines and\nhumans have capturing and assigning these into predefined categories. This\npaper investigates the ambiguity in human perception of emotions and sentiment\nin German oral history interviews and the impact on machine learning systems.\nOur experiments reveal substantial differences in human perception for\ndifferent emotions.

In this paper, we aim to propose a novel approach for encoding\nvectorized associations between data points for the purpose of enabling smooth\ntransitions between Graph and Topological Data Analytics. We conclusively\nreveal effective ways of converting such vectorized associations to simplicial\ncomplexes representing micro-states in a Phase-Space, resulting in filter\nspecific, homotopic self-expressive, event-driven unique topological signatures\nwhich we have referred as Roy-Kesselman Diagrams or R-K Diagrams with\npersistent homology, which emerge from filter-based encodings of R-K Models.\nThe validity and impact of this approach were tested specifically on\nhigh-dimensional raw and derived measures of Gravitational Wave Data from the\nlatest LIGO datasets published by the LIGO Open Science Centre along with\ntesting a generalized approach for a non-scientific use-case, which has been\ndemonstrated using the Tableau Superstore Sales dataset. We believe the\nfindings of our work will lay the foundation for many future scientific and\nengineering applications of stable, high-dimensional data analysis with the\ncombined effectiveness of Topological Graph Theory transformations.",

    "abstract": "The ability of snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems to efficiently\ncapture high-dimensional (HD) data has led to an inverse problem, which\nconsists of recovering the HD signal from the compressed and noisy measurement.\nWhile reconstruction algorithms grow fast to solve it with the recent advances\nof deep learning, the fundamental issue of accurate and stable recovery\nremains. To this end, we propose deep equilibrium models (DEQ) for video SCI,\nfusing data-driven regularization and stable convergence in a theoretically\nsound manner. Each equilibrium model implicitly learns a nonexpansive operator\nand analytically computes the fixed point, thus enabling unlimited iterative\nsteps and infinite network depth with only a constant memory requirement in\ntraining and testing. Specifically, we demonstrate how DEQ can be applied to\ntwo existing models for video SCI reconstruction: recurrent neural networks\n(RNN) and Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithms. On a variety of datasets and real\ndata, both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of our results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and stability of our proposed method. The code and models\nwill be released to the public.",

However, under\nconsideration of numerous environmental factors mathematical modeling can get\nchallenging. We present an approach to model the separate influences of each\nenvironmental quantity on the cells in a collective manner by introducing the\n\"environmental stress level\". It is an immeasurable auxiliary variable, which\nquantifies to what extent viable cells would get in a stressed state, if\nexposed to certain conditions. A high stress level can inhibit cell growth,\npromote cell death and influence cell movement. As a proof of concept, we\ncompare two systems of ordinary differential equations, which model tumor cell\ndynamics under various nutrient saturations respectively with and without\nconsidering an environmental stress level. Particle-based Bayesian inversion\nmethods are used to quantify uncertainties and calibrate unknown model\nparameters with time resolved measurements of in vitro populations of liver\ncancer cells. The calibration results of both models are compared and the\nquality of fit is quantified. While predictions of both models show good\nagreement with the data, there is indication that the model considering the\nstress level yields a better fitting.",

    "abstract": "Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) are very popular methods in\nmachine learning and have been applied very successfully to the prediction of\nthe properties of molecules and materials. First-order GCNNs are well known to\nbe incomplete, i.e., there exist graphs that are distinct but appear identical\nwhen seen through the lens of the GCNN. More complicated schemes have thus been\ndesigned to increase their resolving power. Applications to molecules (and more\ngenerally, point clouds), however, add a geometric dimension to the problem.\nThe most straightforward and prevalent approach to construct graph\nrepresentation for the molecules regards atoms as vertices in a graph and draws\na bond between each pair of atoms within a certain preselected cutoff. Bonds\ncan be decorated with the distance between atoms, and the resulting \"distance\ngraph convolution NNs\" (dGCNN) have empirically demonstrated excellent\nresolving power and are widely used in chemical ML. Here we show that even for\nthe restricted case of graphs induced by 3D atom clouds dGCNNs are not\ncomplete. We construct pairs of distinct point clouds that generate graphs\nthat, for any cutoff radius, are equivalent based on a first-order\nWeisfeiler-Lehman test. This class of degenerate structures includes\nchemically-plausible configurations, setting an ultimate limit to the\nexpressive power of some of the well-established GCNN architectures for\natomistic machine learning.
