    "abstract": "Imaging, scattering, and spectroscopy are fundamental in understanding and\ndiscovering new functional materials. Contemporary innovations in automation\nand experimental techniques have led to these measurements being performed much\nfaster and with higher resolution, thus producing vast amounts of data for\nanalysis. These innovations are particularly pronounced at user facilities and\nsynchrotron light sources. Machine learning (ML) methods are regularly\ndeveloped to process and interpret large datasets in real-time with\nmeasurements. However, there remain conceptual barriers to entry for the\nfacility general user community, whom often lack expertise in ML, and technical\nbarriers for deploying ML models. Herein, we demonstrate a variety of\narchetypal ML models for on-the-fly analysis at multiple beamlines at the\nNational Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II). We describe these examples\ninstructively, with a focus on integrating the models into existing\nexperimental workflows, such that the reader can easily include their own ML\ntechniques into experiments at NSLS-II or facilities with a common\ninfrastructure. The framework presented here shows how with little effort,\ndiverse ML models operate in conjunction with feedback loops via integration\ninto the existing Bluesky Suite for experimental orchestration and data\nmanagement.",

    "abstract": "This work aims to reproduce results from the CVPR 2020 paper by Gidaris et\nal. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is used to learn feature representations of\nan image using an unlabeled dataset. This work proposes to use bag-of-words\n(BoW) deep feature descriptors as a self-supervised learning target to learn\nrobust, deep representations. BowNet is trained to reconstruct the histogram of\nvisual words (ie. the deep BoW descriptor) of a reference image when presented\na perturbed version of the image as input. Thus, this method aims to learn\nperturbation-invariant and context-aware image features that can be useful for\nfew-shot tasks or supervised downstream tasks. In the paper, the author\ndescribes BowNet as a network consisting of a convolutional feature extractor\n$\\Phi(\\cdot)$ and a Dense-softmax layer $\\Omega(\\cdot)$ trained to predict BoW\nfeatures from images. After BoW training, the features of $\\Phi$ are used in\ndownstream tasks. For this challenge we were trying to build and train a\nnetwork that could reproduce the CIFAR-100 accuracy improvements reported in\nthe original paper. However, we were unsuccessful in reproducing an accuracy\nimprovement comparable to what the authors mentioned.",

Thanks to computational advances, large\ndatasets can be exploited to improve diagnosis and discover patterns in\npathologies. However, this requires efficient and scalable image retrieval\nmethods. Cross-modality image retrieval is particularly demanding, as images of\nthe same content captured in different modalities may display little common\ninformation. We propose a content-based image retrieval system (CBIR) for\nreverse (sub-)image search to retrieve microscopy images in one modality given\na corresponding image captured by a different modality, where images are not\naligned and share only few structures. We propose to combine deep learning to\ngenerate representations which embed both modalities in a common space, with\nclassic, fast, and robust feature extractors (SIFT, SURF) to create a\nbag-of-words model for efficient and reliable retrieval. Our\napplication-independent approach shows promising results on a publicly\navailable dataset of brightfield and second harmonic generation microscopy\nimages. We obtain 75.4% and 83.6% top-10 retrieval success for retrieval in one\nor the other direction. Our proposed method significantly outperforms both\ndirect retrieval of the original multimodal (sub-)images, as well as their\ncorresponding generative adversarial network (GAN)-based image-to-image\ntranslations. We establish that the proposed method performs better in\ncomparison with a recent sub-image retrieval toolkit, GAN-based image-to-image\ntranslations, and learnt feature extractors for the downstream task of\ncross-modal image retrieval. We highlight the shortcomings of the latter\nmethods and observe the importance of equivariance and invariance properties of\nthe learnt representations and feature extractors in the CBIR pipeline.

With ongoing development of biomimetic unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs), the potential for supermaneuverability through biomimetic\nmechanisms becomes apparent. So far, this potential has not been well studied:\nbiomimetic UAVs have not yet been shown to be capable of any of the forms of\nclassical supermaneuverability available to thrust-vectored aircraft.

    "abstract": "The trend towards specialization of software and hardware - fuelled by the\nend of Moore's law and the still accelerating interest in domain-specific\ncomputing, such as machine learning - forces us to radically rethink our\ncompiler designs. The era of a universal compiler framework built around a\nsingle one-size-fits-all intermediate representation (IR) is over. This\nrealization has sparked the creation of the MLIR compiler framework that\nempowers compiler engineers to design and integrate IRs capturing specific\nabstractions. MLIR provides a generic framework for SSA-based IRs, but it\ndoesn't help us to decide how we should design IRs that are easy to develop, to\nwork with and to combine into working compilers.\nTo address the challenge of IR design, we advocate for a language-oriented\ncompiler design that understands IRs as formal programming languages and\nenforces their correct use via an accompanying type system. We argue that\nprogramming language techniques directly guide extensible IR designs and\nprovide a formal framework to reason about transforming between multiple IRs.\nIn this paper, we discuss the design of the Shine compiler that compiles the\nhigh-level functional pattern-based data-parallel language RISE via a hybrid\nfunctional-imperative intermediate language to C, OpenCL, and OpenMP.\nWe compare our work directly with the closely related pattern-based Lift IR\nand compiler. We demonstrate that our language-oriented compiler design results\nin a more robust and predictable compiler that is extensible at various\nabstraction levels.

To this end, we combine information-theoretic\narguments with stochastic competition-based activations, namely Stochastic\nLocal Winner-Takes-All (LWTA) units. In this context, we ditch the conventional\ndeep architectures commonly used in Representation Learning, that rely on\nnon-linear activations; instead, we replace them with sets of locally and\nstochastically competing linear units. In this setting, each network layer\nyields sparse outputs, determined by the outcome of the competition between\nunits that are organized into blocks of competitors. We adopt stochastic\narguments for the competition mechanism, which perform posterior sampling to\ndetermine the winner of each block. We further endow the considered networks\nwith the ability to infer the sub-part of the network that is essential for\nmodeling the data at hand; we impose appropriate stick-breaking priors to this\nend. To further enrich the information of the emerging representations, we\nresort to information-theoretic principles, namely the Information Competing\nProcess (ICP). Then, all the components are tied together under the stochastic\nVariational Bayes framework for inference.

    "abstract": "Humans use causality and hypothetical retrospection in their daily\ndecision-making, planning, and understanding of life events. The human mind,\nwhile retrospecting a given situation, think about questions such as \"What was\nthe cause of the given situation?\", \"What would be the effect of my action?\",\nor \"Which action led to this effect?\". It develops a causal model of the world,\nwhich learns with fewer data points, makes inferences, and contemplates\ncounterfactual scenarios. The unseen, unknown, scenarios are known as\ncounterfactuals. AI algorithms use a representation based on knowledge graphs\n(KG) to represent the concepts of time, space, and facts. A KG is a graphical\ndata model which captures the semantic relationships between entities such as\nevents, objects, or concepts. The existing KGs represent causal relationships\nextracted from texts based on linguistic patterns of noun phrases for causes\nand effects as in ConceptNet and WordNet. The current causality representation\nin KGs makes it challenging to support counterfactual reasoning. A richer\nrepresentation of causality in AI systems using a KG-based approach is needed\nfor better explainability, and support for intervention and counterfactuals\nreasoning, leading to improved understanding of AI systems by humans. The\ncausality representation requires a higher representation framework to define\nthe context, the causal information, and the causal effects. The proposed\nCausal Knowledge Graph (CausalKG) framework, leverages recent progress of\ncausality and KG towards explainability. CausalKG intends to address the lack\nof a domain adaptable causal model and represent the complex causal relations\nusing the hyper-relational graph representation in the KG. We show that the\nCausalKG's interventional and counterfactual reasoning can be used by the AI\nsystem for the domain explainability.",

However, in this era of big\ndata, rule induction on the whole datasets is computationally intensive. So\nfar, to the best of our knowledge, no known method focusing on accelerating\nrule induction has been reported. This is first study to consider the\nacceleration technique to reduce the scale of computation in rule induction. We\npropose an accelerator for rule induction based on fuzzy rough theory; the\naccelerator can avoid redundant computation and accelerate the building of a\nrule classifier. First, a rule induction method based on consistence degree,\ncalled Consistence-based Value Reduction (CVR), is proposed and used as basis\nto accelerate. Second, we introduce a compacted search space termed Key Set,\nwhich only contains the key instances required to update the induced rule, to\nconduct value reduction. The monotonicity of Key Set ensures the feasibility of\nour accelerator. Third, a rule-induction accelerator is designed based on Key\nSet, and it is theoretically guaranteed to display the same results as the\nunaccelerated version. Specifically, the rank preservation property of Key Set\nensures consistency between the rule induction achieved by the accelerator and\nthe unaccelerated method. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed accelerator can perform remarkably faster than the unaccelerated\nrule-based classifier methods, especially on datasets with numerous instances.",

    "abstract": "Fair machine learning aims to mitigate the biases of model predictions\nagainst certain subpopulations regarding sensitive attributes such as race and\ngender. Among the many existing fairness notions, counterfactual fairness\nmeasures the model fairness from a causal perspective by comparing the\npredictions of each individual from the original data and the counterfactuals.\nIn counterfactuals, the sensitive attribute values of this individual had been\nmodified. Recently, a few works extend counterfactual fairness to graph data,\nbut most of them neglect the following facts that can lead to biases: 1) the\nsensitive attributes of each node's neighbors may causally affect the\nprediction w.r.t. this node; 2) the sensitive attributes may causally affect\nother features and the graph structure. To tackle these issues, in this paper,\nwe propose a novel fairness notion - graph counterfactual fairness, which\nconsiders the biases led by the above facts. To learn node representations\ntowards graph counterfactual fairness, we propose a novel framework based on\ncounterfactual data augmentation. In this framework, we generate\ncounterfactuals corresponding to perturbations on each node's and their\nneighbors' sensitive attributes. Then we enforce fairness by minimizing the\ndiscrepancy between the representations learned from the original graph and the\ncounterfactuals for each node. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world\ngraphs show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in\ngraph counterfactual fairness, and also achieves comparable prediction\nperformance.",

These spurious correlations, between input samples and the target\nlabels, wrongly direct the neural network predictions resulting in poor\nperformance on certain groups, especially the minority groups. Robust training\nagainst these spurious correlations requires the knowledge of group membership\nfor every sample. Such a requirement is impractical in situations where the\ndata labeling efforts for minority or rare groups are significantly laborious\nor where the individuals comprising the dataset choose to conceal sensitive\ninformation. On the other hand, the presence of such data collection efforts\nresults in datasets that contain partially labeled group information. Recent\nworks have tackled the fully unsupervised scenario where no labels for groups\nare available. Thus, we aim to fill the missing gap in the literature by\ntackling a more realistic setting that can leverage partially available\nsensitive or group information during training. First, we construct a\nconstraint set and derive a high probability bound for the group assignment to\nbelong to the set.

However, many ILP systems lack the ability\nto naturally learn from any noisy or partially misclassified training data. We\nintroduce the relaxed learning from failures approach to ILP, a noise handling\nmodification of the previously introduced learning from failures (LFF) approach\nwhich is incapable of handling noise. We additionally introduce the novel Noisy\nPopper ILP system which implements this relaxed approach and is a modification\nof the existing Popper system. Like Popper, Noisy Popper takes a\ngenerate-test-constrain loop to search its hypothesis space wherein failed\nhypotheses are used to construct hypothesis constraints. These constraints are\nused to prune the hypothesis space, making the hypothesis search more\nefficient. However, in the relaxed setting, constraints are generated in a more\nlax fashion as to avoid allowing noisy training data to lead to hypothesis\nconstraints which prune optimal hypotheses. Constraints unique to the relaxed\nsetting are generated via hypothesis comparison. Additional constraints are\ngenerated by weighing the accuracy of hypotheses against their sizes to avoid\noverfitting through an application of the minimum description length. We\nsupport this new setting through theoretical proofs as well as experimental\nresults which suggest that Noisy Popper improves the noise handling\ncapabilities of Popper but at the cost of overall runtime efficiency.",

    "title": "Pavlovian Signalling with General Value Functions in Agent-Agent  Temporal Decision Making",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we contribute a multi-faceted study into Pavlovian signalling\n-- a process by which learned, temporally extended predictions made by one\nagent inform decision-making by another agent. Signalling is intimately\nconnected to time and timing. In service of generating and receiving signals,\nhumans and other animals are known to represent time, determine time since past\nevents, predict the time until a future stimulus, and both recognize and\ngenerate patterns that unfold in time. We investigate how different temporal\nprocesses impact coordination and signalling between learning agents by\nintroducing a partially observable decision-making domain we call the Frost\nHollow. In this domain, a prediction learning agent and a reinforcement\nlearning agent are coupled into a two-part decision-making system that works to\nacquire sparse reward while avoiding time-conditional hazards. We evaluate two\ndomain variations: machine agents interacting in a seven-state linear walk, and\nhuman-machine interaction in a virtual-reality environment. Our results\nshowcase the speed of learning for Pavlovian signalling, the impact that\ndifferent temporal representations do (and do not) have on agent-agent\ncoordination, and how temporal aliasing impacts agent-agent and human-agent\ninteractions differently. As a main contribution, we establish Pavlovian\nsignalling as a natural bridge between fixed signalling paradigms and fully\nadaptive communication learning between two agents. We further show how to\ncomputationally build this adaptive signalling process out of a fixed\nsignalling process, characterized by fast continual prediction learning and\nminimal constraints on the nature of the agent receiving signals. Our results\ntherefore suggest an actionable, constructivist path towards communication\nlearning between reinforcement learning agents.",

    "title": "Robust Trajectory Tracking and Payload Delivery of a Quadrotor Under  Multiple State Constraints",
    "abstract": "With quadrotors becoming immensely popular in applications such as relief\noperations, infrastructure maintenance etc., a key control design challenge\narises when the quadrotor has to manoeuvre through constrained spaces during\nvarious operational scenarios: for example, inspecting a pipeline within\npredefined velocity and space, dropping relief material at a precise location\nunder tight spaces etc., under the face of parametric uncertainties and\nexternal disturbances. To tackle such scenarios, a controller needs to ensure a\npredefined tracking accuracy so as not to violate the constraints while\nsimultaneously tackling uncertainties and disturbances. However,\nstate-of-the-art controllers dealing with constrained system motion are either\nnot applicable for an underactuated system like quadrotor, or cannot tackle\nsystem uncertainties under full state constraints. This work attempts to fill\nsuch a gap in literature by designing Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) based\nrobust controllers to satisfy multiple state-constraints while simultaneously\nnegotiating parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. The superiority\nof the BLF control method over a typical unconstrained controller is\ndemonstrated, followed by a robust control design to satisfy position and\norientation constraints on quadrotor dynamics. Finally, full state-constraints\non a quadrotor(i.e., constraints on the position, orientation, linear velocity\nand angular velocity) are satisfied with robust control. For each control\ndesign, the closed-loop system stability is studied analytically and the\nefficacy of the design is validated extensively either via realistic simulation\nscenarios or via experiments performed on a real quadrotor.",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that reliable and efficient domain truncation is crucial to\naccurate numerical solution of most wave propagation problems. The perfectly\nmatched layer (PML) is a method which, when stable, can provide a domain\ntruncation scheme which is convergent with increasing layer width/damping. The\ndifficulties in using the PML are primarily associated with stability, which\ncan be present at the continuous level or be triggered by numerical\napproximations. The mathematical and numerical analysis of the PML for\nhyperbolic wave propagation problems has been an area of active research. It is\nnow possible to construct stable and high order accurate numerical wave solvers\nby augmenting wave equations with the PML and approximating the equations using\nsummation-by-parts finite difference methods, continuous and discontinuous\nGalerkin finite element methods. In this review we summarise the progress made,\nfrom mathematical, numerical and practical perspectives, point out some open\nproblems and set the stage for future work. We also present numerical\nexperiments of model problems corroborating the theoretical analysis, and\nnumerical simulations of real-world wave propagation demonstrating impact.\nStable and parallel implementations of the PML in the high performance\ncomputing software packages WaveQLab3D and ExaHyPE allow to sufficiently limit\nthe computational domain of seismological problems with only a few grid\npoints/elements around the computational boundaries where the PML is active,\nthus saving as much as $96\\%$ of the required computational resources for a\nthree space dimensional seismological benchmark problem.",

    "abstract": "Applications running in geographically distributed setting are becoming\nprevalent. Large-scale online services often share or replicate their data into\nmultiple data centers (DCs) in different geographic regions. Driven by the data\ncommunication need of these applications, inter-datacenter network (IDN) is\ngetting increasingly important.\nHowever, we find congestion control for inter-datacenter networks quite\nchallenging. Firstly, the inter-datacenter communication involves both data\ncenter networks (DCNs) and wide-area networks (WANs) connecting multiple data\ncenters. Such a network environment presents quite heterogeneous\ncharacteristics (e.g., buffer depths, RTTs). Existing congestion control\nmechanisms consider either DCN or WAN congestion, while not simultaneously\ncapturing the degree of congestion for both.\nSecondly, to reduce evolution cost and improve flexibility, large enterprises\nhave been building and deploying their wide-area routers based on\nshallow-buffered switching chips. However, with legacy congestion control\nmechanisms (e.g., TCP Cubic), shallow buffer can easily get overwhelmed by\nlarge BDP (bandwidth-delay product) wide-area traffic, leading to high packet\nlosses and degraded throughput.\nThis thesis describes my research efforts on optimizing congestion control\nmechanisms for the inter-datacenter networks. First, we design GEMINI - a\npractical congestion control mechanism that simultaneously handles congestions\nboth in DCN andWAN. Second, we present FlashPass - a proactive congestion\ncontrol mechanism that achieves near zero loss without degrading throughput\nunder the shallow-buffered WAN. Extensive evaluation shows their superior\nperformance over existing congestion control mechanisms.",

Although the visual analytics community has proposed\nnumerous taxonomies to facilitate this mapping process, no formal methods exist\nfor systematically applying these existing theories to user interaction logs.\nThis paper seeks to bridge the gap between visualization task taxonomies and\ninteraction log data by making the taxonomies more actionable for interaction\nlog analysis. To achieve this, we leverage structural parallels between how\npeople express themselves through interactions and language by reformulating\nexisting theories as regular grammars. We represent interactions as terminals\nwithin a regular grammar, similar to the role of individual words in a\nlanguage, and patterns of interactions or non-terminals as regular expressions\nover these terminals to capture common language patterns. To demonstrate our\napproach, we generate regular grammars for seven visualization taxonomies and\ndevelop code to apply them to three interaction log datasets. In analyzing our\nresults, we find that existing taxonomies at the low-level (i.e., terminals)\nshow mixed results in expressing multiple interaction log datasets, and\ntaxonomies at the high-level (i.e., regular expressions) have limited\nexpressiveness, due to primarily two challenges: inconsistencies in interaction\nlog dataset granularity and structure, and under-expressiveness of certain\nterminals. Based on our findings, we suggest new research directions for the\nvisualization community for augmenting existing taxonomies, developing new\nones, and building better interaction log recording processes to facilitate the\ndata-driven development of user behavior taxonomies.",

With recent\nadvances in consensus technology, the performance limit has been greatly\nlifted, typically to thousands of transactions per second. With this,\ntransaction execution has become a new performance bottleneck. Exploiting\nparallelism in transaction execution is a clear and direct way to address this\nand further increase transaction throughput. Although some recent literature\nintroduced concurrency control mechanisms to execute smart contract\ntransactions in parallel, the reported speedup that they can achieve is far\nfrom ideal. The main reason is that the proposed parallel execution mechanisms\ncannot effectively deal with the conflicts inherent in many blockchain\napplications.\nIn this work, we thoroughly study the historical transaction execution traces\nin Ethereum. We observe that application-inherent conflicts are the major\nfactors that limit the exploitable parallelism during execution. We propose to\nuse partitioned counters and special commutative instructions to break up the\napplication conflict chains in order to maximize the potential speedup. During\nour evaluations, these techniques doubled the parallel speedup achievable to an\n18x overall speedup compared to serial execution, approaching the optimum.

    "abstract": "Today's programmers, especially data science practitioners, make heavy use of\ndata-processing libraries (APIs) such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, NumPy, Pandas,\nand the like. Program synthesizers can provide significant coding assistance to\nthis community of users; however program synthesis also can be slow due to\nenormous search spaces.\nIn this work, we examine ways in which machine learning can be used to\naccelerate enumerative program synthesis. We present a deep-learning-based\nmodel to predict the sequence of API functions that would be needed to go from\na given input to a desired output, both being numeric vectors. Our work is\nbased on two insights. First, it is possible to learn, based on a large number\nof input-output examples, to predict the likely API function needed in a given\nsituation. Second, and crucially, it is also possible to learn to compose API\nfunctions into a sequence, given an input and the desired final output, without\nexplicitly knowing the intermediate values.\nWe show that we can speed up an enumerative program synthesizer by using\npredictions from our model variants. These speedups significantly outperform\nprevious ways (e.g. DeepCoder) in which researchers have used ML models in\nenumerative synthesis.",

However, previous deep learning methods tend to neglect the mutual\ninfluences between medical findings, which can be the bottleneck that limits\nthe quality of generated reports. In this work, we propose to mine and\nrepresent the associations among medical findings in an informative knowledge\ngraph and incorporate this prior knowledge with radiology report generation to\nhelp improve the quality of generated reports.

    "abstract": "In this work we present the first initialization methods equipped with\nexplicit performance guarantees adapted to the pose-graph simultaneous\nlocalization and mapping (SLAM) and rotation averaging (RA) problems. SLAM and\nrotation averaging are typically formalized as large-scale nonconvex point\nestimation problems, with many bad local minima that can entrap the smooth\noptimization methods typically applied to solve them; the performance of\nstandard SLAM and RA algorithms thus crucially depends upon the quality of the\nestimates used to initialize this local search. While many initialization\nmethods for SLAM and RA have appeared in the literature, these are typically\nobtained as purely heuristic approximations, making it difficult to determine\nwhether (or under what circumstances) these techniques can be reliably\ndeployed. In contrast, in this work we study the problem of initialization\nthrough the lens of spectral relaxation. Specifically, we derive a simple\nspectral relaxation of SLAM and RA, the form of which enables us to exploit\nclassical linear-algebraic techniques (eigenvector perturbation bounds) to\ncontrol the distance from our spectral estimate to both the (unknown)\nground-truth and the global minimizer of the estimation problem as a function\nof measurement noise. Our results reveal the critical role that spectral\ngraph-theoretic properties of the measurement network play in controlling\nestimation accuracy; moreover, as a by-product of our analysis we obtain new\nbounds on the estimation error for the maximum likelihood estimators in SLAM\nand RA, which are likely to be of independent interest. Finally, we show\nexperimentally that our spectral estimator is very effective in practice,\nproducing initializations of comparable or superior quality at lower\ncomputational cost compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.",

One of the biggest challenges in applying deep learning methods to\nRGB/IR object detection is the lack of available training data for drone IR\nimagery, especially at night.

    "abstract": "Creation of images using generative adversarial networks has been widely\nadapted into multi-modal regime with the advent of multi-modal representation\nmodels pre-trained on large corpus. Various modalities sharing a common\nrepresentation space could be utilized to guide the generative models to create\nimages from text or even from audio source. Departing from the previous methods\nthat solely rely on either text or audio, we exploit the expressiveness of both\nmodality. Based on the fusion of text and audio, we create video whose content\nis consistent with the distinct modalities that are provided. A simple approach\nto automatically segment the video into variable length intervals and maintain\ntime consistency in generated video is part of our method. Our proposed\nframework for generating music video shows promising results in application\nlevel where users can interactively feed in music source and text source to\ncreate artistic music videos.

    "abstract": "Unobserved confounding is the main obstacle to causal effect estimation from\nobservational data. Instrumental variables (IVs) are widely used for causal\neffect estimation when there exist latent confounders. With the standard IV\nmethod, when a given IV is valid, unbiased estimation can be obtained, but the\nvalidity requirement of standard IV is strict and untestable. Conditional IV\nhas been proposed to relax the requirement of standard IV by conditioning on a\nset of observed variables (known as a conditioning set for a conditional IV).\nHowever, the criterion for finding a conditioning set for a conditional IV\nneeds complete causal structure knowledge or a directed acyclic graph (DAG)\nrepresenting the causal relationships of both observed and unobserved\nvariables. This makes it impossible to discover a conditioning set directly\nfrom data. In this paper, by leveraging maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) in\ncausal inference with latent variables, we propose a new type of IV, ancestral\nIV in MAG, and develop the theory to support data-driven discovery of the\nconditioning set for a given ancestral IV in MAG. Based on the theory, we\ndevelop an algorithm for unbiased causal effect estimation with an ancestral IV\nin MAG and observational data. Extensive experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets have demonstrated the performance of the algorithm in\ncomparison with existing IV methods.",

    "abstract": "Recent works explore learning graph representations in a self-supervised\nmanner. In graph contrastive learning, benchmark methods apply various graph\naugmentation approaches. However, most of the augmentation methods are\nnon-learnable, which causes the issue of generating unbeneficial augmented\ngraphs. Such augmentation may degenerate the representation ability of graph\ncontrastive learning methods. Therefore, we motivate our method to generate\naugmented graph by a learnable graph augmenter, called MEta Graph Augmentation\n(MEGA). We then clarify that a \"good\" graph augmentation must have uniformity\nat the instance-level and informativeness at the feature-level. To this end, we\npropose a novel approach to learning a graph augmenter that can generate an\naugmentation with uniformity and informativeness. The objective of the graph\naugmenter is to promote our feature extraction network to learn a more\ndiscriminative feature representation, which motivates us to propose a\nmeta-learning paradigm. Empirically, the experiments across multiple benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that MEGA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in\ngraph self-supervised learning tasks.

Due to its low cost and high\npopularity, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) has been used to detect proximity based\non the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). To address the fact that RSSI\ncan be markedly influenced by device carriage states, previous works have\nincorporated RSSI with inertial measurement unit (IMU) using deep learning.\nHowever, they have not sufficiently accounted for the impact of multipath.\nFurthermore, due to the special setup, the IMU data collected in the training\nprocess may be biased, which hampers the system's robustness and\ngeneralizability. This issue has not been studied before. We propose PRID, an\nIMU-assisted BLE proximity detection approach robust against RSSI fluctuation\nand IMU data bias. PRID histogramizes RSSI to extract multipath features and\nuses carriage state regularization to mitigate overfitting due to IMU data\nbias. We further propose PRID-lite based on a binarized neural network to\nsubstantially cut memory requirements for resource-constrained devices. We have\nconducted extensive experiments under different multipath environments, data\nbias levels, and a crowdsourced dataset. Our results show that PRID\nsignificantly reduces false detection cases compared with the existing arts (by\nover 50%).

As calculating the maximum robustness radius is\ncomputationally hard, we estimate its upper and lower bound. We repurpose\nattack methods as ways of seeking upper bound and design a pseudo-dynamic\nprogramming algorithm for a tighter upper bound. Then verification method is\nutilized for a lower bound. Further, for evaluating the robustness of regions\noutside a safe radius, we reexamine robustness from another view:\nquantification. A robustness metric with a rigorous statistical guarantee is\nintroduced to measure the quantification of adversarial examples, which\nindicates the model's susceptibility to perturbations outside the safe radius.\nThe metric helps us figure out why state-of-the-art models like BERT can be\neasily fooled by a few word substitutions, but generalize well in the presence\nof real-world noises.",

One staple of this data-driven approach is to learn from\nexpert demonstrations. In the past, multiple ideas have been proposed to make\ngood use of the demonstrations added to the replay buffer, such as pretraining\non demonstrations only or minimizing additional cost functions. We present a\nnew method, able to leverage demonstrations and episodes collected online in\nany sparse-reward environment with any off-policy algorithm. Our method is\nbased on a reward bonus given to demonstrations and successful episodes,\nencouraging expert imitation and self-imitation. First, we give a reward bonus\nto the transitions coming from demonstrations to encourage the agent to match\nthe demonstrated behaviour. Then, upon collecting a successful episode, we\nrelabel its transitions with the same bonus before adding them to the replay\nbuffer, encouraging the agent to also match its previous successes. Our\nexperiments focus on manipulation robotics, specifically on three tasks for a 6\ndegrees-of-freedom robotic arm in simulation.

Most pioneering approaches reduce intra-class variations and\ninter-modality discrepancies by learning modality-shared and ID-related\nfeatures. However, an explicit modality-shared cue, i.e., body keypoints, has\nnot been fully exploited in VI-ReID. Additionally, existing feature learning\nparadigms imposed constraints on either global features or partitioned feature\nstripes, which neglect the prediction consistency of global and part features.\nTo address the above problems, we exploit Pose Estimation as an auxiliary\nlearning task to assist the VI-ReID task in an end-to-end framework. By jointly\ntraining these two tasks in a mutually beneficial manner, our model learns\nhigher quality modality-shared and ID-related features. On top of it, the\nlearnings of global features and local features are seamlessly synchronized by\nHierarchical Feature Constraint (HFC), where the former supervises the latter\nusing the knowledge distillation strategy. Experimental results on two\nbenchmark VI-ReID datasets show that the proposed method consistently improves\nstate-of-the-art methods by significant margins.

    "abstract": "Existing learning methods for LiDAR-based applications use 3D points scanned\nunder a pre-determined beam configuration, e.g., the elevation angles of beams\nare often evenly distributed. Those fixed configurations are task-agnostic, so\nsimply using them can lead to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we take a\nnew route to learn to optimize the LiDAR beam configuration for a given\napplication. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning-based\nlearning-to-optimize (RL-L2O) framework to automatically optimize the beam\nconfiguration in an end-to-end manner for different LiDAR-based applications.\nThe optimization is guided by the final performance of the target task and thus\nour method can be integrated easily with any LiDAR-based application as a\nsimple drop-in module. The method is especially useful when a low-resolution\n(low-cost) LiDAR is needed, for instance, for system deployment at a massive\nscale. We use our method to search for the beam configuration of a\nlow-resolution LiDAR for two important tasks: 3D object detection and\nlocalization. Experiments show that the proposed RL-L2O method improves the\nperformance in both tasks significantly compared to the baseline methods. We\nbelieve that a combination of our method with the recent advances of\nprogrammable LiDARs can start a new research direction for LiDAR-based active\nperception.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous computers integrate general-purpose host processors with\ndomain-specific accelerators to combine versatility with efficiency and high\nperformance. To realize the full potential of heterogeneous computers, however,\nmany hardware and software design challenges have to be overcome. While\narchitectural and system simulators can be used to analyze heterogeneous\ncomputers, they are faced with unavoidable compromises between simulation speed\nand performance modeling accuracy. In this work we present HEROv2, an\nFPGA-based research platform that enables accurate and fast exploration of\nheterogeneous computers consisting of accelerators based on clusters of 32-bit\nRISC-V cores and an application-class 64-bit ARMv8 or RV64 host processor.\nHEROv2 allows to seamlessly share data between 64-bit hosts and 32-bit\naccelerators and comes with a fully open-source on-chip network, a unified\nheterogeneous programming interface, and a mixed-data-model, mixed-ISA\nheterogeneous compiler based on LLVM. We evaluate HEROv2 in four case studies\nfrom the application level over toolchain and system architecture down to\naccelerator microarchitecture. We demonstrate how HEROv2 enables effective\nresearch and development on the full stack of heterogeneous computing. For\ninstance, the compiler can tile loops and infer data transfers to and from the\naccelerators, which leads to a speedup of up to 4.4x compared to the original\nprogram and in most cases is only 15 % slower than a handwritten\nimplementation, which requires 2.6x more code.",

    "abstract": "Sink mobility is seen as a successful strategy to resolve the hotspot problem\nin Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Mobile sinks roam in the network and collect\ndata from special nodes such as Cluster Heads (CH) by means of short-range\ncommunications which improves the energy efficiency. Numerous mobile sink based\nrouting protocols have been proposed, however, they incur high delays\nespecially in large scale networks where the mobile sink has to travel for a\nlong distance to collect data from CHs and consequently they failed to ensure a\ntradeoff between energy efficiency and delay. To resolve this issue, we propose\nin this paper an Effective Hybrid Routing Protocol termed as EHRP. The main aim\nof this protocol is to combine between single-hop and multi-hop routing.\nIndeed, when the mobile sink arrives at a cluster it collects its data while\nthe other distant CHs continue to send their data using our proposed improved\nAnt Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to avoid the waiting-time. The existing\nACO algorithms use in the distance heuristic which is not practical in real\nworld and fail to consider relevant statistic information of energy (e.g.,\nminimum energy, average energy) in path selection which leads to unbalanced\nenergy consumption in the network. To address these issues, the proposed\nrouting algorithm employs the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and\nstatistic information of energy to consume energy efficiently and decrease the\nprobability of sending failure. The performance of the proposed routing\nprotocol is tested and compared with those of the relevant routing protocols.\nThe simulation results show that, in comparison with its counterparts, EHRP\nsucceeds to minimize energy consumption and delay as well as enhancing the\npacket delivery ratio.",

The most\nwidely adopted mechanisms tackling this task are the pioneering exponential\nmechanism and permute-and-flip, which can offer utility improvements of up to a\nfactor of two over the exponential mechanism. This work introduces a new\ndifferentially private mechanism for private selection and conducts theoretical\nand empirical comparisons with the above mechanisms. For reasonably common\nscenarios, our mechanism can provide utility improvements of factors\nsignificantly larger than two over the exponential and permute-and-flip\nmechanisms.

    "abstract": "The combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with deep learning has led to\na series of impressive feats, with many believing (deep) RL provides a path\ntowards generally capable agents. However, the success of RL agents is often\nhighly sensitive to design choices in the training process, which may require\ntedious and error-prone manual tuning. This makes it challenging to use RL for\nnew problems, while also limits its full potential. In many other areas of\nmachine learning, AutoML has shown it is possible to automate such design\nchoices and has also yielded promising initial results when applied to RL.\nHowever, Automated Reinforcement Learning (AutoRL) involves not only standard\napplications of AutoML but also includes additional challenges unique to RL,\nthat naturally produce a different set of methods. As such, AutoRL has been\nemerging as an important area of research in RL, providing promise in a variety\nof applications from RNA design to playing games such as Go. Given the\ndiversity of methods and environments considered in RL, much of the research\nhas been conducted in distinct subfields, ranging from meta-learning to\nevolution.

    "abstract": "To achieve successful field autonomy, mobile robots need to freely adapt to\nchanges in their environment. Visual navigation systems such as Visual Teach\nand Repeat (VT&R) often assume the space around the reference trajectory is\nfree, but if the environment is obstructed path tracking can fail or the robot\ncould collide with a previously unseen obstacle. In this work, we present a\nlocally reactive controller for a VT&R system that allows a robot to navigate\nsafely despite physical changes to the environment. Our controller uses a local\nelevation map to compute vector representations and outputs twist commands for\nnavigation at 10 Hz. They are combined in a Riemannian Motion Policies (RMP)\ncontroller that requires <2 ms to run on a CPU. We integrated our controller\nwith a VT&R system onboard an ANYmal C robot and tested it in indoor cluttered\nspaces and a large-scale underground mine. We demonstrate that our locally\nreactive controller keeps the robot safe when physical occlusions or loss of\nvisual tracking occur such as when walking close to walls, crossing doorways,\nor traversing narrow corridors.

Re-evaluating the characteristics of algorithms for\nthe direct solution of tridiagonal systems, we develop a new tridiagonal solver\nlibrary aimed at implementing high-performance computing applications on Xilinx\nFPGA hardware. Key new features of the library are (1) the unification of\nstandard state-of-the-art techniques for implementing implicit numerical\nsolvers with a number of novel high-gain optimizations such as vectorization\nand batching, motivated by multi-dimensional systems in real-world\napplications, (2) data-flow techniques that provide application specific\noptimizations for both 2D and 3D problems, including integration of explicit\nloops commonplace in real workloads, and (3) the development of an analytic\nmodel to explore the design space, and obtain rapid performance estimates. The\nnew library provide an order of magnitude better performance for solving large\nbatches of systems compared to Xilinx's current tridiagonal solver library. Two\nrepresentative applications are implemented using the new solver on a Xilinx\nAlveo U280 FPGA, demonstrating over 85% predictive model accuracy.

Results show the FPGAs achieving\ncompetitive or better runtime performance for a range of multi-dimensional\nproblems compared to the V100 GPU.

    "abstract": "The imbalanced classification problem turns out to be one of the important\nand challenging problems in data mining and machine learning. The performances\nof traditional classifiers will be severely affected by many data problems,\nsuch as class imbalanced problem, class overlap and noise. The Tomek-Link\nalgorithm was only used to clean data when it was proposed. In recent years,\nthere have been reports of combining Tomek-Link algorithm with sampling\ntechnique. The Tomek-Link sampling algorithm can effectively reduce the class\noverlap on data, remove the majority instances that are difficult to\ndistinguish, and improve the algorithm classification accuracy. However, the\nTomek-Links under-sampling algorithm only considers the boundary instances that\nare the nearest neighbors to each other globally and ignores the potential\nlocal overlapping instances. When the number of minority instances is small,\nthe under-sampling effect is not satisfactory, and the performance improvement\nof the classification model is not obvious. Therefore, on the basis of\nTomek-Link, a multi-granularity relabeled under-sampling algorithm (MGRU) is\nproposed. This algorithm fully considers the local information of the data set\nin the local granularity subspace, and detects the local potential overlapping\ninstances in the data set. Then, the overlapped majority instances are\neliminated according to the global relabeled index value, which effectively\nexpands the detection range of Tomek-Links. The simulation results show that\nwhen we select the optimal global relabeled index value for under-sampling, the\nclassification accuracy and generalization performance of the proposed\nunder-sampling algorithm are significantly better than other baseline\nalgorithms.",

We\ngenerate visual attention maps using the question-conditioned image attention\nscores in these co-attention layers.

We compare the neural network attention maps against human attention\nmaps both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our findings indicate that\nco-attention transformer modules are crucial in attending to relevant regions\nof the image given a question. Importantly, we observe that the semantic\nmeaning of the question is not what drives visual attention, but specific\nkeywords in the question do.

    "abstract": "Driven by climate change, rising environmental awareness, and financial\nincentives, more and more commercial fleets transition to electric vehicles.\nHowever, this endeavor remains challenging as time-inefficient charge\noperations and lack of public charging infrastructure require fleet operators\nto invest into additional private on-premise charging stations. Here, grid\ncapacity constraints and investment cost limit the number of available charging\nstations such that charging bottlenecks may arise. Accordingly, efficient\nscheduling of charge and service operations becomes inevitable to realize\nprofitable fleets. Creating the underlying schedules constitutes a challenging\noptimization problem, especially when additional factors, such as battery\ndegradation, variable energy prices, and non-linear battery behavior need to be\nconsidered. In this paper, we study the resulting joint charge and service\noperations scheduling problem, that combines the scheduling of vehicle service\noperations and charge scheduling. We propose an exact algorithm based on branch\n& price to solve this problem. This algorithm bases on an exact labeling\nalgorithm developed for a novel resource constrained shortest path problem,\nwhich models our pricing problem, and leverages a custom branching rule and a\nprimal heuristic to accelerate the branch & bound phase. We benchmark our\nalgorithm in a comprehensive numerical study and show that it can solve\nrealistic problem instances with computational times below one hour, thus\nenabling its application in practice. Additionally, we analyze the benefit of\njointly scheduling charging and service operations in practice. We find that\nour integrated approach lowers the amount of charging infrastructure required\nfor fleet operation by up to 57% besides enabling cost savings of up to 5%.",

    "title": "Demystifying the Vulnerability Propagation and Its Evolution via  Dependency Trees in the NPM Ecosystem",
    "abstract": "Third-party libraries with rich functionalities facilitate the fast\ndevelopment of Node.js software, but also bring new security threats that\nvulnerabilities could be introduced through dependencies. In particular, the\nthreats could be excessively amplified by transitive dependencies. Existing\nresearch either considers direct dependencies or reasoning transitive\ndependencies based on reachability analysis, which neglects the NPM-specific\ndependency resolution rules, resulting in wrongly resolved dependencies.\nConsequently, further fine-grained analysis, such as vulnerability propagation\nand their evolution in dependencies, cannot be carried out precisely at a large\nscale, as well as deriving ecosystem-wide solutions for vulnerabilities in\ndependencies. To fill this gap, we propose a knowledge graph-based dependency\nresolution, which resolves the dependency relations of dependencies as trees\n(i.e., dependency trees), and investigates the security threats from\nvulnerabilities in dependency trees at a large scale. We first construct a\ncomplete dependency-vulnerability knowledge graph (DVGraph) that captures the\nwhole NPM ecosystem (over 10 million library versions and 60 million\nwell-resolved dependency relations). Based on it, we propose DTResolver to\nstatically and precisely resolve dependency trees, as well as transitive\nvulnerability propagation paths, by considering the official dependency\nresolution rules. Based on that, we carry out an ecosystem-wide empirical study\non vulnerability propagation and its evolution in dependency trees. Our study\nunveils lots of useful findings, and we further discuss the lessons learned and\nsolutions for different stakeholders to mitigate the vulnerability impact in\nNPM. For example, we implement a dependency tree based vulnerability\nremediation method (DTReme) for NPM packages, and receive much better\nperformance than the official tool (npm audit fix).",

    "abstract": "Wearing masks is crucial to preventing the spread of potentially\npathogen-containing droplets, especially amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However,\nnot all face coverings are equally effective and most experiments evaluating\nmask efficacy are very expensive and complex to operate. In this work, a novel,\nhome-built, low-cost, and accurate metrology to visualize orally-generated\nfluid droplets has been developed. The project includes setup optimization,\ndata collection, data analysis, and applications. The final materials chosen\nwere quinine-containing tonic water, 397-402 nm wavelength UV tube lights, an\niPhone and tripod, string, and a spray bottle. The experiment took place in a\ndark closet with a dark background. During data collection, the test subject\nfirst wets their mouth with an ingestible fluorescent liquid (tonic water) and\nspeaks, sneezes, or coughs under UV darklight. The fluorescence from the tonic\nwater droplets generated can be visualized, recorded by an iPhone 8+ camera in\nslo-mo (240 fps), and analyzed. The software VLC is used for frame separation\nand Fiji/ImageJ is used for image processing and analysis. The dependencies of\noral fluid droplet generation and propagation on different phonics, the\nloudness of speech, and the type of expiratory event were studied in detail and\nestablished using the metrology developed. The efficacy of different types of\nmasks was evaluated and correlated with fabric microstructures. All masks\nblocked droplets to varying extent. Masks with smaller-sized pores and thicker\nmaterial were found to block the most droplets. This low-cost technique can be\neasily constructed at home using materials that total to a cost of less than\n$50. Despite the minimal cost, the method is very accurate and the data is\nquantifiable.",

Developing a scalable system for the orchestration of\nend-to-end (E2E) mobile network slices requires careful planning and very\nreliable algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel E2E Network Slicing\nOrchestration System (NSOS) and a Dynamic Auto- Scaling Algorithm (DASA) for\nit. Our NSOS relies strongly on the foundation of a hierarchical architecture\nthat incorporates dedicated entities per domain to manage every segment of the\nmobile network from the access, to the transport and core network part for a\nscalable orchestration of federated network slices. The DASA enables the NSOS\nto autonomously adapt its resources to changes in the demand for slice\norchestration requests (SORs) while enforcing a given mean overall time taken\nby the NSOS to process any SOR. The proposed DASA includes both proactive and\nreactive resource provisioning techniques). The proposed resource dimensioning\nheuristic algorithm of the DASA is based on a queuing model for the NSOS, which\nconsists of an open network of G/G/m queues. Finally, we validate the proper\noperation and evaluate the performance of our DASA solution for the NSOS by\nmeans of system-level simulations.",

The success of\nthis technology heavily relies on the full situational awareness of its\nsurrounding entities. This is achievable only when everything is networked,\nincluding vehicles, users and infrastructure, and exchange the sensed data\namong the nearby objects to increase their awareness. Nevertheless, human\nintervention is still needed in the loop anyway to deal with unseen situations\nor compensate for inaccurate or improper vehicle's decisions. For such cases,\nvideo feed, in addition to other data such as LIDAR, is considered essential to\nprovide humans with the real picture of what is hap-pening to eventually take\nthe right decision. However, if the video is not delivered in a timely\nfashion,it becomes useless or likely produce catastrophic outcomes.\nAdditionally, any disruption in the streamed video, for instance during\nhandover operation while traversing inter-countries cross borders, is very\nannoying to the user and possibly ause damages as well. In this article, we\nstart by describing two important use cases, namely Remote Driving and\nPlatooning, where the timely delivery of video is of extreme importance [1].\nThereafter, we detail our implemented solution to accommodate the\naforementioned use cases for self-driving vehicles.

SGADV utilizes the dissimilarity score to\nproduce the optimized adversarial example, i.e., similarity-based adversarial\nattack. This technique applies to both white-box and gray-box attacks against\nauthentication systems that determine genuine or imposter users using the\ndissimilarity score. To validate the effectiveness of SGADV, we conduct\nextensive experiments on face datasets of LFW, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ against\ndeep face recognition models of FaceNet and InsightFace in both white-box and\ngray-box settings. The results suggest that the proposed method significantly\noutperforms the existing adversarial attack techniques in the gray-box setting.\nWe hence summarize that the similarity-base approaches to develop the\nadversarial example could satisfactorily cater to the gray-box attack scenarios\nfor de-authentication.",

The approach relies on the computation\nof an uncertainty-aware safe region for each robot to navigate among other\nrobots and static obstacles in the environment, under the assumption of\nGaussian-distributed uncertainty. In particular, at each time step, we\nconstruct a chance-constrained buffered uncertainty-aware Voronoi cell (B-UAVC)\nfor each robot given a specified collision probability threshold.

In\nessence, it generates paired probabilities and masks corresponding to category\nsegments and combines them during inference for the segmentation maps. The\nsegmentation quality thus relies on how well the queries can capture the\nsemantic information for categories and their spatial locations within the\nimages. In our study, we find that per-mask classification decoder on top of a\nsingle-scale feature is not effective enough to extract reliable probability or\nmask. To mine for rich semantic information across the feature pyramid, we\npropose a transformer-based Pyramid Fusion Transformer (PFT) for per-mask\napproach semantic segmentation on top of multi-scale features. To efficiently\nutilize image features of different resolutions without incurring too much\ncomputational overheads, PFT uses a multi-scale transformer decoder with\ncross-scale inter-query attention to exchange complimentary information.\nExtensive experimental evaluations and ablations demonstrate the efficacy of\nour framework. In particular, we achieve a 3.2 mIoU improvement on COCO-Stuff\n10K dataset with ResNet-101c compared to MaskFormer.

    "abstract": "It is not trivial to optimally learn a 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D\nConvNets) due to high complexity and various options of the training scheme.\nThe most common hand-tuning process starts from learning 3D ConvNets using\nshort video clips and then is followed by learning long-term temporal\ndependency using lengthy clips, while gradually decaying the learning rate from\nhigh to low as training progresses. The fact that such process comes along with\nseveral heuristic settings motivates the study to seek an optimal \"path\" to\nautomate the entire training. In this paper, we decompose the path into a\nseries of training \"states\" and specify the hyper-parameters, e.g., learning\nrate and the length of input clips, in each state. The estimation of the knee\npoint on the performance-epoch curve triggers the transition from one state to\nanother. We perform dynamic programming over all the candidate states to plan\nthe optimal permutation of states, i.e., optimization path. Furthermore, we\ndevise a new 3D ConvNets with a unique design of dual-head classifier to\nimprove spatial and temporal discrimination. Extensive experiments on seven\npublic video recognition benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of our proposal.\nWith the optimization planning, our 3D ConvNets achieves superior results when\ncomparing to the state-of-the-art recognition methods.

Each task equips the synthetic frame with one\nability, while each regularizer enhances its visual quality. With these, by\njointly learning the frame synthesis in an end-to-end manner, the generated\nframe is expected to encapsulate the required spatio-temporal information\nuseful for video analysis. Extensive experiments are conducted on the\nlarge-scale Kinetics dataset. When comparing to baseline methods that map video\nsequence to a single image, IFS shows superior performance. More remarkably,\nIFS consistently demonstrates evident improvements on image-based 2D networks\nand clip-based 3D networks, and achieves comparable performance with the\nstate-of-the-art methods with less computational cost.",

    "abstract": "Video content is multifaceted, consisting of objects, scenes, interactions or\nactions. The existing datasets mostly label only one of the facets for model\ntraining, resulting in the video representation that biases to only one facet\ndepending on the training dataset. There is no study yet on how to learn a\nvideo representation from multifaceted labels, and whether multifaceted\ninformation is helpful for video representation learning. In this paper, we\npropose a new learning framework, MUlti-Faceted Integration (MUFI), to\naggregate facets from different datasets for learning a representation that\ncould reflect the full spectrum of video content. Technically, MUFI formulates\nthe problem as visual-semantic embedding learning, which explicitly maps video\nrepresentation into a rich semantic embedding space, and jointly optimizes\nvideo representation from two perspectives. One is to capitalize on the\nintra-facet supervision between each video and its own label descriptions, and\nthe second predicts the \"semantic representation\" of each video from the facets\nof other datasets as the inter-facet supervision. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that learning 3D CNN via our MUFI framework on a union of four\nlarge-scale video datasets plus two image datasets leads to superior capability\nof video representation. The pre-learnt 3D CNN with MUFI also shows clear\nimprovements over other approaches on several downstream video applications.\nMore remarkably, MUFI achieves 98.1%/80.9% on UCF101/HMDB51 for action\nrecognition and 101.5% in terms of CIDEr-D score on MSVD for video captioning.",

    "abstract": "Live video broadcasting normally requires a multitude of skills and expertise\nwith domain knowledge to enable multi-camera productions. As the number of\ncameras keep increasing, directing a live sports broadcast has now become more\ncomplicated and challenging than ever before. The broadcast directors need to\nbe much more concentrated, responsive, and knowledgeable, during the\nproduction. To relieve the directors from their intensive efforts, we develop\nan innovative automated sports broadcast directing system, called Smart\nDirector, which aims at mimicking the typical human-in-the-loop broadcasting\nprocess to automatically create near-professional broadcasting programs in\nreal-time by using a set of advanced multi-view video analysis algorithms.\nInspired by the so-called \"three-event\" construction of sports broadcast, we\nbuild our system with an event-driven pipeline consisting of three consecutive\nnovel components: 1) the Multi-view Event Localization to detect events by\nmodeling multi-view correlations, 2) the Multi-view Highlight Detection to rank\ncamera views by the visual importance for view selection, 3) the\nAuto-Broadcasting Scheduler to control the production of broadcasting videos.\nTo our best knowledge, our system is the first end-to-end automated directing\nsystem for multi-camera sports broadcasting, completely driven by the semantic\nunderstanding of sports events. It is also the first system to solve the novel\nproblem of multi-view joint event detection by cross-view relation modeling. We\nconduct both objective and subjective evaluations on a real-world multi-camera\nsoccer dataset, which demonstrate the quality of our auto-generated videos is\ncomparable to that of the human-directed. Thanks to its faster response, our\nsystem is able to capture more fast-passing and short-duration events which are\nusually missed by human directors.",

In this paper, we ask the question: how important is\nthe motion particularly for self-supervised video representation learning. To\nthis end, we compose a duet of exploiting the motion for data augmentation and\nfeature learning in the regime of contrastive learning. Specifically, we\npresent a Motion-focused Contrastive Learning (MCL) method that regards such\nduet as the foundation. On one hand, MCL capitalizes on optical flow of each\nframe in a video to temporally and spatially sample the tubelets (i.e.,\nsequences of associated frame patches across time) as data augmentations. On\nthe other hand, MCL further aligns gradient maps of the convolutional layers to\noptical flow maps from spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal perspectives, in\norder to ground motion information in feature learning. Extensive experiments\nconducted on R(2+1)D backbone demonstrate the effectiveness of our MCL. On\nUCF101, the linear classifier trained on the representations learnt by MCL\nachieves 81.91% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ImageNet supervised pre-training\nby 6.78%.

Although these two\ncategories of papers cannot be easily identified and separated, the scientific\nlevel of Japan and the hypothesis that would explain its poor bibliometric\nevaluations can be tested by studying the extreme upper tail of the citation\ndistribution of all scientific articles. In contrast to standard bibliometric\nindicators, which are calculated from the total number of papers or from sets\nof papers in which the two categories of papers are mixed, in the extreme upper\ntail, only papers of the first category will be present.

    "abstract": "The importance of the dynamics of the viewport pose, i.e., location and\norientation of users' points of view, for virtual reality (VR) experiences\ncalls for the development of VR viewport pose models. In this paper, informed\nby our experimental measurements of viewport trajectories in 3 VR games and\nacross 3 different types of VR interfaces, we first develop a statistical model\nof viewport poses in VR environments. Based on the developed model, we examine\nthe correlations between pixels in VR frames that correspond to different\nviewport poses, and obtain an analytical expression for the visibility\nsimilarity (ViS) of the pixels across different VR frames. We then propose a\nlightweight ViS-based ALG-ViS algorithm that adaptively splits VR frames into\nbackground and foreground, reusing the background across different frames. Our\nimplementation of ALG-ViS in two Oculus Quest 2 rendering systems demonstrates\nALG-ViS running in real time, supporting the full VR frame rate, and\noutperforming baselines on measures of frame quality and bandwidth consumption.",

    "abstract": "In the area of graph drawing, the One-Sided Crossing Minimization Problem\n(OSCM) is defined on a bipartite graph with both vertex sets aligned parallel\nto each other and all edges being drawn as straight lines. The task is to find\na permutation of one of the node sets such that the total number of all\nedge-edge intersections, called crossings, is minimized. Usually, the degree of\nthe nodes of one set is limited by some constant k, with the problem then\nabbreviated to OSCM-k.\nIn this work, we study an online variant of this problem, in which one of the\nnode sets is already given. The other node set and the incident edges are\nrevealed iteratively and each node has to be inserted into placeholders, which\nwe call slots. The goal is again to minimize the number of crossings in the\nfinal graph. Minimizing crossings in an online way is related to the more\nempirical field of dynamic graph drawing. Note the slotted OSCM problem makes\ninstances harder to solve for an online algorithm but in the offline case it is\nequivalent to the version without slots.\nWe show that the online slotted OSCM-k is not competitive for any k greater\nor equal 2 and subsequently limit the graph class to that of 2-regular graphs,\nfor which we show a lower bound of 4/3 and an upper bound of 5 on the\ncompetitive ratio.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to identify chicken eggs fertility using the support vector\nmachine (SVM) classifier method. The classification basis used the first-order\nstatistical (FOS) parameters as feature extraction in the identification\nprocess. This research was developed based on the process's identification\nprocess, which is still manual (conventional). Although currently there are\nmany technologies in the identification process, they still need development.\nThus, this research is one of the developments in the field of image processing\ntechnology. The sample data uses datasets from previous studies with a total of\n100 egg images. The egg object in the image is a single object. From these\ndata, the classification of each fertile and infertile egg is 50 image data.\nChicken egg image data became input in image processing, with the initial\nprocess is segmentation. This initial segmentation aims to get the cropped\nimage according to the object. The cropped image is repaired using image\npreprocessing with grayscaling and image enhancement methods. This method\n(image enhancement) used two combination methods: contrast limited adaptive\nhistogram equalization (CLAHE) and histogram equalization (HE). The improved\nimage becomes the input for feature extraction using the FOS method. The FOS\nuses five parameters, namely mean, entropy, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.\nThe five parameters entered into the SVM classifier method to identify the\nfertility of chicken eggs. The results of these experiments, the method\nproposed in the identification process has a success percentage of 84.57%.\nThus, the implementation of this method can be used as a reference for future\nresearch improvements. In addition, it may be possible to use a second-order\nfeature extraction method to improve its accuracy and improve supervised\nlearning for classification.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is an emerging methodology that has recently\nattracted computational scientists working on nonintrusive reduced order\nmodeling. One of the major strengths that DMD possesses is having ground\ntheoretical roots from the Koopman approximation theory. Indeed, DMD may be\nviewed as the data-driven realization of the famous Koopman operator.\nNonetheless, the stable implementation of DMD incurs computing the singular\nvalue decomposition of the input data matrix. This, in turn, makes the process\ncomputationally demanding for high dimensional systems. In order to alleviate\nthis burden, we develop a framework based on sketching methods, wherein a\nsketch of a matrix is simply another matrix which is significantly smaller, but\nstill sufficiently approximates the original system. Such sketching or\nembedding is performed by applying random transformations, with certain\nproperties, on the input matrix to yield a compressed version of the initial\nsystem. Hence, many of the expensive computations can be carried out on the\nsmaller matrix, thereby accelerating the solution of the original problem. We\nconduct numerical experiments conducted using the spherical shallow water\nequations as a prototypical model in the context of geophysical flows. The\nperformance of several sketching approaches is evaluated for capturing the\nrange and co-range of the data matrix. The proposed sketching-based framework\ncan accelerate various portions of the DMD algorithm, compared to classical\nmethods that operate directly on the raw input data. This eventually leads to\nsubstantial computational gains that are vital for digital twinning of high\ndimensional systems.",

DM-VIO performs photometric bundle adjustment with a dynamic weight\nfor visual residuals. We adopt marginalization, which is a popular strategy to\nkeep the update time constrained, but it cannot easily be reversed, and\nlinearization points of connected variables have to be fixed. To overcome this\nwe propose delayed marginalization: The idea is to maintain a second factor\ngraph, where marginalization is delayed. This allows us to later readvance this\ndelayed graph, yielding an updated marginalization prior with new and\nconsistent linearization points. In addition, delayed marginalization enables\nus to inject IMU information into already marginalized states. This is the\nfoundation of the proposed pose graph bundle adjustment, which we use for IMU\ninitialization. In contrast to prior works on IMU initialization, it is able to\ncapture the full photometric uncertainty, improving the scale estimation. In\norder to cope with initially unobservable scale, we continue to optimize scale\nand gravity direction in the main system after IMU initialization is complete.\nWe evaluate our system on the EuRoC, TUM-VI, and 4Seasons datasets, which\ncomprise flying drone, large-scale handheld, and automotive scenarios.

    "abstract": "The electrical generation and transmission infrastructures of many countries\nare under increased pressure. This partially reflects the move towards low\ncarbon economies and the increased reliance on renewable power generation\nsystems. There has been a reduction in the use of traditional fossil fuel\ngeneration systems, which provide a stable base load, and this has been\nreplaced with more unpredictable renewable generation. As a consequence, the\navailable load on the grid is becoming more unstable. To cope with this\nvariability, the UK National Grid has placed emphasis on the investigation of\nvarious technical mechanisms (e.g. implementation of smart grids, energy\nstorage technologies, auxiliary power sources), which may be able to prevent\ncritical situations, when the grid may become sometimes unstable. The\nsuccessful implementation of these mechanisms may require large numbers of\nelectrical consumers (e.g. HVAC systems, food refrigeration systems) for\nexample to make additional investments in energy storage technologies (food\nrefrigeration systems) or to integrate their electrical demand from industrial\nprocesses into the National Grid (HVAC systems). However, in the situation of\nfood refrigeration systems, during these critical situations, even if the\nthermal inertia within refrigeration systems may maintain effective performance\nof the device for a short period of time (e.g. under 1 minute) when the\nelectrical input load into the system is reduced, this still carries the\nparamount risk of food safety even for very short periods of time (e.g. under 1\nminute). Therefore before considering any future actions (e.g. investing in\nenergy storage technologies) to prevent the critical situations when grid\nbecomes unstable, it is also needed to understand during the normal use how the\ntemperature profiles evolve along the time inside these massive networks of\nfood refrigeration systems.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has long been considered as a black box for predicting\ncombustion chemical kinetics due to the extremely large number of parameters\nand the lack of evaluation standards and reproducibility. The current work aims\nto understand two basic questions regarding the deep neural network (DNN)\nmethod: what data the DNN needs and how general the DNN method can be. Sampling\nand preprocessing determine the DNN training dataset, further affect DNN\nprediction ability. The current work proposes using Box-Cox transformation\n(BCT) to preprocess the combustion data. In addition, this work compares\ndifferent sampling methods with or without preprocessing, including the Monte\nCarlo method, manifold sampling, generative neural network method (cycle-GAN),\nand newly-proposed multi-scale sampling. Our results reveal that the DNN\ntrained by the manifold data can capture the chemical kinetics in limited\nconfigurations but cannot remain robust toward perturbation, which is\ninevitable for the DNN coupled with the flow field. The Monte Carlo and\ncycle-GAN samplings can cover a wider phase space but fail to capture\nsmall-scale intermediate species, producing poor prediction results. A\nthree-hidden-layer DNN, based on the multi-scale method without specific flame\nsimulation data, allows predicting chemical kinetics in various scenarios and\nbeing stable during the temporal evolutions. This single DNN is readily\nimplemented with several CFD codes and validated in various combustors,\nincluding (1). zero-dimensional autoignition, (2). one-dimensional freely\npropagating flame, (3). two-dimensional jet flame with triple-flame structure,\nand (4). three-dimensional turbulent lifted flames.

    "abstract": "MRI scan time reduction is commonly achieved by Parallel Imaging methods,\ntypically based on uniform undersampling of the inverse image space (a.k.a.\nk-space) and simultaneous signal reception with multiple receiver coils. The\nGRAPPA method interpolates missing k-space signals by linear combination of\nadjacent, acquired signals across all coils, and can be described by a\nconvolution in k-space. Recently, a more generalized method called RAKI was\nintroduced. RAKI is a deep-learning method that generalizes GRAPPA with\nadditional convolution layers, on which a non-linear activation function is\napplied. This enables non-linear estimation of missing signals by convolutional\nneural networks. In analogy to GRAPPA, the convolution kernels in RAKI are\ntrained using scan-specific training samples obtained from\nauto-calibration-signals (ACS). RAKI provides superior reconstruction quality\ncompared to GRAPPA, however, often requires much more ACS due to its increased\nnumber of unknown parameters. In order to overcome this limitation, this study\ninvestigates the influence of training data on the reconstruction quality for\nstandard 2D imaging, with particular focus on its amount and contrast\ninformation. Furthermore, an iterative k-space interpolation approach (iRAKI)\nis evaluated, which includes training data augmentation via an initial GRAPPA\nreconstruction, and refinement of convolution filters by iterative training.\nUsing only 18, 20 and 25 ACS lines (8%), iRAKI outperforms RAKI by suppressing\nresidual artefacts occurring at accelerations factors R=4 and R=5, and yields\nstrong noise suppression in comparison to GRAPPA, underlined by quantitative\nquality metrics. Combination with a phase-constraint yields further\nimprovement. Additionally, iRAKI shows better performance than GRAPPA and RAKI\nin case of pre-scan calibration and strongly varying contrast between training-\nand undersampled data.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing large-scale data from simulations of turbulent flows is memory\nintensive, requiring significant resources. This major challenge highlights the\nneed for data compression techniques. In this study, we apply a\nphysics-informed Deep Learning technique based on vector quantization to\ngenerate a discrete, low-dimensional representation of data from simulations of\nthree-dimensional turbulent flows. The deep learning framework is composed of\nconvolutional layers and incorporates physical constraints on the flow, such as\npreserving incompressibility and global statistical characteristics of the\nvelocity gradients. The accuracy of the model is assessed using statistical,\ncomparison-based similarity and physics-based metrics. The training data set is\nproduced from Direct Numerical Simulation of an incompressible, statistically\nstationary, isotropic turbulent flow. The performance of this lossy data\ncompression scheme is evaluated not only with unseen data from the stationary,\nisotropic turbulent flow, but also with data from decaying isotropic\nturbulence, and a Taylor-Green vortex flow. Defining the compression ratio (CR)\nas the ratio of original data size to the compressed one, the results show that\nour model based on vector quantization can offer CR $=85$ with a mean square\nerror (MSE) of $O(10^{-3})$, and predictions that faithfully reproduce the\nstatistics of the flow, except at the very smallest scales where there is some\nloss. Compared to the recent study based on a conventional autoencoder where\ncompression is performed in a continuous space, our model improves the CR by\nmore than $30$ percent, and reduces the MSE by an order of magnitude. Our\ncompression model is an attractive solution for situations where fast, high\nquality and low-overhead encoding and decoding of large data are required.",

Because of the success of conventional deep learning kernels,\nthe less versatile Gabor kernels become less popular despite the fact that they\ncan provide abundant features at different frequencies, orientations, and\nscales with much fewer parameters. For existing loss functions for multi-class\nimage segmentation, there is usually a tradeoff among accuracy, robustness to\nhyperparameters, and manual weight selections for combining different losses.\nTherefore, to gain the benefits of using Gabor kernels while keeping the\nadvantage of automatic feature generation in deep learning, we propose a fully\ntrainable Gabor-based convolutional layer where all Gabor parameters are\ntrainable through backpropagation. Furthermore, we propose a loss function\nbased on the Pearson's correlation coefficient, which is accurate, robust to\nlearning rates, and does not require manual weight selections. Experiments on\n43 3D brain magnetic resonance images with 19 anatomical structures show that,\nusing the proposed loss function with a proper combination of conventional and\nGabor-based kernels, we can train a network with only 1.6 million parameters to\nachieve an average Dice coefficient of 83%.

Starting from very general geometric\narguments we introduce two families of coefficients measuring the extent to\nwhich relations are shaped by similarity or complementarity.

State-of-the-art deep learning approaches predominantly\napply convolutional layers in segmentation and are typically highly customized\nfor a specific experimental configuration; often unable to generalize to\nunknown data. As the model capacity of classical convolutional layers is\nlimited by a finite set of learned kernels, our approach uses a graph\nrepresentation of the image and focuses on the node transitions in multiple\nmagnifications. We propose a novel architecture for semantic segmentation of\ncell nuclei robust to differences in experimental configuration such as\nstaining and variation of cell types. The architecture is comprised of a novel\nneuroplastic graph attention network based on residual graph attention layers\nand concurrent optimization of the graph structure representing multiple\nmagnification levels of the histopathological image. The modification of graph\nstructure, which generates the node features by projection, is as important to\nthe architecture as the graph neural network itself. It determines the possible\nmessage flow and critical properties to optimize attention, graph structure,\nand node updates in a balanced magnification loss.

In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-modality\nsupervised contrastive learning framework, named COROLLA, for glaucoma grading.\nThrough layer segmentation as well as thickness calculation and projection,\nretinal thickness maps are extracted from the original OCT volumes and used as\na replacing modality, resulting in more efficient calculations with less memory\nusage. Given the high structure and distribution similarities across medical\nimage samples, we employ supervised contrastive learning to increase our\nmodels' discriminative power with better convergence. Moreover, feature-level\nfusion of paired fundus image and thickness map is conducted for enhanced\ndiagnosis accuracy. On the GAMMA dataset, our COROLLA framework achieves\noverwhelming glaucoma grading performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Multi-speaker singing voice synthesis is to generate the singing voice sung\nby different speakers. To generalize to new speakers, previous zero-shot\nsinging adaptation methods obtain the timbre of the target speaker with a\nfixed-size embedding from single reference audio. However, they face several\nchallenges: 1) the fixed-size speaker embedding is not powerful enough to\ncapture full details of the target timbre; 2) single reference audio does not\ncontain sufficient timbre information of the target speaker; 3) the pitch\ninconsistency between different speakers also leads to a degradation in the\ngenerated voice. In this paper, we propose a new model called MR-SVS to tackle\nthese problems. Specifically, we employ both a multi-reference encoder and a\nfixed-size encoder to encode the timbre of the target speaker from multiple\nreference audios. The Multi-reference encoder can capture more details and\nvariations of the target timbre. Besides, we propose a well-designed pitch\nshift method to address the pitch inconsistency problem.

    "abstract": "The combination of a deep neural network (DNN) -based speech enhancement (SE)\nfront-end and an automatic speech recognition (ASR) back-end is a widely used\napproach to implement overlapping speech recognition. However, the SE front-end\ngenerates processing artifacts that can degrade the ASR performance. We\npreviously found that such performance degradation can occur even under fully\noverlapping conditions, depending on the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To mitigate the degradation, we introduced a\nrule-based method to switch the ASR input between the enhanced and observed\nsignals, which showed promising results. However, the rule's optimality was\nunclear because it was heuristically designed and based only on SIR and SNR\nvalues. In this work, we propose a DNN-based switching method that directly\nestimates whether ASR will perform better on the enhanced or observed signals.\nWe also introduce soft-switching that computes a weighted sum of the enhanced\nand observed signals for ASR input, with weights given by the switching model's\noutput posteriors. The proposed learning-based switching showed performance\ncomparable to that of rule-based oracle switching. The soft-switching further\nimproved the ASR performance and achieved a relative character error rate\nreduction of up to 23 % as compared with the conventional method.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) system development is\ndata and computation intensive. The optimal design of deep neural networks\n(DNNs) for these systems often require expert knowledge and empirical\nevaluation. In this paper, a range of neural architecture search (NAS)\ntechniques are used to automatically learn two types of hyper-parameters of\nfactored time delay neural networks (TDNN-Fs): i) the left and right splicing\ncontext offsets; and ii) the dimensionality of the bottleneck linear projection\nat each hidden layer. These techniques include the differentiable neural\narchitecture search (DARTS) method integrating architecture learning with\nlattice-free MMI training; Gumbel-Softmax and pipelined DARTS methods reducing\nthe confusion over candidate architectures and improving the generalization of\narchitecture selection; and Penalized DARTS incorporating resource constraints\nto balance the trade-off between performance and system complexity. Parameter\nsharing among TDNN-F architectures allows an efficient search over up to 7^28\ndifferent systems. Statistically significant word error rate (WER) reductions\nof up to 1.2% absolute and relative model size reduction of 31% were obtained\nover a state-of-the-art 300-hour Switchboard corpus trained baseline LF-MMI\nTDNN-F system featuring speed perturbation, i-Vector and learning hidden unit\ncontribution (LHUC) based speaker adaptation as well as RNNLM rescoring.\nPerformance contrasts on the same task against recent end-to-end systems\nreported in the literature suggest the best NAS auto-configured system achieves\nstate-of-the-art WERs of 9.9% and 11.1% on the NIST Hub5' 00 and Rt03s test\nsets respectively with up to 96% model size reduction. Further analysis using\nBayesian learning shows that the proposed NAS approaches can effectively\nminimize the structural redundancy in the TDNN-F systems and reduce their model\nparameter uncertainty. Consistent performance improvements were also obtained\non a UASpeech dysarthric speech recognition task.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is a large worldwide healthcare issue; symptoms often\npresent suddenly with minimal warning. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a fast,\nsimple and reliable method of evaluating the health of the heart, by measuring\nelectrical activity recorded through electrodes placed on the skin. ECGs often\nneed to be analyzed by a cardiologist, taking time which could be spent on\nimproving patient care and outcomes. Because of this, automatic ECG\nclassification systems using machine learning have been proposed, which can\nlearn complex interactions between ECG features and use this to detect\nabnormalities. However, algorithms built for this purpose often fail to\ngeneralize well to unseen data, reporting initially impressive results which\ndrop dramatically when applied to new environments. Additionally, machine\nlearning algorithms suffer a \"black-box\" issue, in which it is difficult to\ndetermine how a decision has been made. This is vital for applications in\nhealthcare, as clinicians need to be able to verify the process of evaluation\nin order to trust the algorithm. This paper proposes a method for visualizing\nmodel decisions across each class in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, using\nadapted saliency maps averaged across complete classes to determine what\npatterns are being learned. We do this by building two algorithms based on\nstate-of-the-art models. This paper highlights how these maps can be used to\nfind problems in the model which could be affecting generalizability and model\nperformance. Comparing saliency maps across complete classes gives an overall\nimpression of confounding variables or other biases in the model, unlike what\nwould be highlighted when comparing saliency maps on an ECG-by-ECG basis.",

    "title": "Systematic Literature Review: Quantum Machine Learning and its  applications",
    "abstract": "Quantum computing is the process of performing calculations using quantum\nmechanics. This field studies the quantum behavior of certain subatomic\nparticles for subsequent use in performing calculations, as well as for\nlarge-scale information processing. These capabilities can give quantum\ncomputers an advantage in terms of computational time and cost over classical\ncomputers. Nowadays, there are scientific challenges that are impossible to\nperform by classical computation due to computational complexity or the time\nthe calculation would take, and quantum computation is one of the possible\nanswers. However, current quantum devices have not yet the necessary qubits and\nare not fault-tolerant enough to achieve these goals. Nonetheless, there are\nother fields like machine learning or chemistry where quantum computation could\nbe useful with current quantum devices. This manuscript aims to present a\nSystematic Literature Review of the papers published between 2017 and 2021 to\nidentify, analyze and classify the different algorithms used in quantum machine\nlearning and their applications. Consequently, this study identified 52\narticles that used quantum machine learning techniques and algorithms. The main\ntypes of found algorithms are quantum implementations of classical machine\nlearning algorithms, such as support vector machines or the k-nearest neighbor\nmodel, and classical deep learning algorithms, like quantum neural networks.\nMany articles try to solve problems currently answered by classical machine\nlearning but using quantum devices and algorithms. Even though results are\npromising, quantum machine learning is far from achieving its full potential.\nAn improvement in the quantum hardware is required since the existing quantum\ncomputers lack enough quality, speed, and scale to allow quantum computing to\nachieve its full potential.",

    "title": "Spectrum Surveying: Active Radio Map Estimation with Autonomous UAVs",
    "abstract": "Radio maps find numerous applications in wireless communications and mobile\nrobotics tasks, including resource allocation, interference coordination, and\nmission planning. Although numerous techniques have been proposed to construct\nradio maps from spatially distributed measurements, the locations of such\nmeasurements are assumed predetermined beforehand. In contrast, this paper\nproposes spectrum surveying, where a mobile robot such as an unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) collects measurements at a set of locations that are actively\nselected to obtain high-quality map estimates in a short surveying time. This\nis performed in two steps. First, two novel algorithms, a model-based online\nBayesian estimator and a data-driven deep learning algorithm, are devised for\nupdating a map estimate and an uncertainty metric that indicates the\ninformativeness of measurements at each possible location. These algorithms\noffer complementary benefits and feature constant complexity per measurement.\nSecond, the uncertainty metric is used to plan the trajectory of the UAV to\ngather measurements at the most informative locations. To overcome the\ncombinatorial complexity of this problem, a dynamic programming approach is\nproposed to obtain lists of waypoints through areas of large uncertainty in\nlinear time. Numerical experiments conducted on a realistic dataset confirm\nthat the proposed scheme constructs accurate radio maps quickly.",
