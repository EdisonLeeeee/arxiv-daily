    "abstract": "In this paper, we implement Neural Ordinary Differential Equations in a\nVariational Autoencoder setting for generative time series modeling. An\nobject-oriented approach to the code was taken to allow for easier development\nand research and all code used in the paper can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/simonmoesorensen/neural-ode-project\nThe results were initially recreated and the reconstructions compared to a\nbaseline Long-Short Term Memory AutoEncoder. The model was then extended with a\nLSTM encoder and challenged by more complex data consisting of time series in\nthe form of spring oscillations. The model showed promise, and was able to\nreconstruct true trajectories for all complexities of data with a smaller RMSE\nthan the baseline model. However, it was able to capture the dynamic behavior\nof the time series for known data in the decoder but was not able to produce\nextrapolations following the true trajectory very well for any of the\ncomplexities of spring data. A final experiment was carried out where the model\nwas also presented with 68 days of solar power production data, and was able to\nreconstruct just as well as the baseline, even when very little data is\navailable.\nFinally, the models training time was compared to the baseline. It was found\nthat for small amounts of data the NODE method was significantly slower at\ntraining than the baseline, while for larger amounts of data the NODE method\nwould be equal or faster at training.\nThe paper is ended with a future work section which describes the many\nnatural extensions to the work presented in this paper, with examples being\ninvestigating further the importance of input data, including extrapolation in\nthe baseline model or testing more specific model setups.",

    "title": "The Concept of Criticality in AI Safety",
    "abstract": "When AI agents don't align their actions with human values they may cause\nserious harm. One way to solve the value alignment problem is by including a\nhuman operator who monitors all of the agent's actions. Despite the fact, that\nthis solution guarantees maximal safety, it is very inefficient, since it\nrequires the human operator to dedicate all of his attention to the agent. In\nthis paper, we propose a much more efficient solution that allows an operator\nto be engaged in other activities without neglecting his monitoring task. In\nour approach the AI agent requests permission from the operator only for\ncritical actions, that is, potentially harmful actions. We introduce the\nconcept of critical actions with respect to AI safety and discuss how to build\na model that measures action criticality. We also discuss how the operator's\nfeedback could be used to make the agent smarter.",

Yet, there is another topic that is closely related\nto the subject of the influence of perceived task difficulty that did not\nreceive any attention in previous research - the influence of revealing the\ntrue difficulty of a task to the student.

Furthermore, we discuss how the experiment\nresults might be relevant for AI-aided education.

This type of technique has gained a lot of attention from\nArtificial Intelligence and Optimization communities in recent years.\nConsidering the good results obtained with Deep RL approaches in different\nareas there is a growing interest in applying them in problems from the\nOperations Research field. We have used a Deep RL technique, namely Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO2), to solve the problem considering uncertain, regular\nand seasonal demands and constant or stochastic lead times. Experiments are\ncarried out in different scenarios to better assess the suitability of the\nalgorithm. An agent based on a linearized model is used as a baseline.\nExperimental results indicate that PPO2 is a competitive and adequate tool for\nthis type of problem. PPO2 agent is better than baseline in all scenarios with\nstochastic lead times (7.3-11.2%), regardless of whether demands are seasonal\nor not. In scenarios with constant lead times, the PPO2 agent is better when\nuncertain demands are non-seasonal (2.2-4.7%).

    "abstract": "Water networks are used in numerous applications, all of which have the\nessential task of real-time monitoring and control of water states. A framework\nfor the generation of efficient models of water networks suitable for real-time\nmonitoring and control purposes is proposed. The proposed models preserve the\ndistributed parameter character of the network local elements. Hence, the\nspatial resolution of the property under consideration is recovered. The\nreal-time feasibility of the network model is ensured by means of reduced-order\nmodeling of the models constituting components. A novel model order reduction\nprocedure that preserves the model parametric dependency is introduced. The\nproposed concept is evaluated with the water temperature as the property under\nconsideration. The formulated model is applied for the prediction of the water\ntemperature within an experimental test bench of a 60-meter exemplary\ncirculation network at the company VIEGA. A reduced-order model (ROM) with a 50\nmm spatial resolution, i.e. 1200 discretization points, is constructed and\nutilized as the identification model for a single path of the test bench.\nAfterward, the ROM is evaluated in a Hardware in the Loop experiment for the\nprediction of the downstream temperature showing high prediction accuracy with\nmean relative error below 3.5\\%. The ROM single step computation time stayed\nbelow 2 msec highlighting the real-time potential of the method. Moreover, full\nnetwork model validation experiments featuring both diffusion and\ntransport-dominated parts were conducted.

    "abstract": "The problem of fair division known as \"cake cutting\" has been the focus of\nmultiple papers spanning several decades. The most prominent problem in this\nline of work has been to bound the query complexity of computing an envy-free\noutcome in the Robertson-Webb query model. However, the root of this problem's\ncomplexity is somewhat artificial: the agents' values are assumed to be\nadditive across different pieces of the \"cake\" but infinitely complicated\nwithin each piece. This is unrealistic in most of the motivating examples,\nwhere the cake represents a finite collection of homogeneous goods.\nWe address this issue by introducing a fair division model that more\naccurately captures these applications: the value that an agent gains from a\ngiven good depends only on the amount of the good they receive, yet it can be\nan arbitrary function of this amount, allowing the agents to express\npreferences that go beyond standard cake cutting. In this model, we study the\nquery complexity of computing allocations that are not just envy-free, but also\napproximately Pareto optimal among all envy-free allocations. Using a novel\nflow-based approach, we show that we can encode the ex-post feasibility of\nrandomized allocations via a polynomial number of constraints, which reduces\nour problem to solving a linear program.",

    "abstract": "It is a challenging task to learn rich and multi-scale spatiotemporal\nsemantics from high-dimensional videos, due to large local redundancy and\ncomplex global dependency between video frames. The recent advances in this\nresearch have been mainly driven by 3D convolutional neural networks and vision\ntransformers. Although 3D convolution can efficiently aggregate local context\nto suppress local redundancy from a small 3D neighborhood, it lacks the\ncapability to capture global dependency because of the limited receptive field.\nAlternatively, vision transformers can effectively capture long-range\ndependency by self-attention mechanism, while having the limitation on reducing\nlocal redundancy with blind similarity comparison among all the tokens in each\nlayer. Based on these observations, we propose a novel Unified transFormer\n(UniFormer) which seamlessly integrates merits of 3D convolution and\nspatiotemporal self-attention in a concise transformer format, and achieves a\npreferable balance between computation and accuracy. Different from traditional\ntransformers, our relation aggregator can tackle both spatiotemporal redundancy\nand dependency, by learning local and global token affinity respectively in\nshallow and deep layers. We conduct extensive experiments on the popular video\nbenchmarks, e.g., Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, and Something-Something V1&V2.\nWith only ImageNet-1K pretraining, our UniFormer achieves 82.9%/84.8% top-1\naccuracy on Kinetics-400/Kinetics-600, while requiring 10x fewer GFLOPs than\nother state-of-the-art methods.

    "title": "Event-centric Query Suggestion for Online News",
    "abstract": "Query suggestion refers to the task of suggesting relevant and related\nqueries to a search engine user to help in query formulation process and to\nexpedite information retrieval with minimum amount of effort. It is highly\nuseful in situations where the search requirements are not well understood and\nhence it has been widely adopted by search engines to guide users' search\nactivity. For news websites, user queries have a time sensitive nature inherent\nin them. When some new event happens, there is a sudden burst in queries\nrelated to that event and such queries are sustained over a period of time\nbefore fading away with that event. In addition to this temporal aspect of\nsearch queries fired at news websites, they have an addition distinct quality,\ni.e., they are intended to get event related information majority of the times.\nExisting work on generating query suggestions involves analyzing query logs to\nsuggest queries which are relevant and related to the search intent of the\nuser. But in case of news websites, when there is a sudden burst in information\nrelated to a particular event, there are not enough search queries fired by\nother users which leads to lack of click data, and hence giving query\nsuggestions related to some old event or even some irrelevant suggestions\naltogether. Another problem with query logs in the context of online news is\nthat, they mostly contain queries related to popular events and hence fail to\ncapture less popular events or events which got overshadowed by some other more\nsensational event. We propose a novel approach to generate event-centric query\nsuggestions using metadata of news articles published by news media. We\ncompared our proposed framework with existing state of the art query suggestion\nmechanisms provided by Google News, Bing News, Google Search and Bing Search on\nvarious parameters.",

Typically,\nthe DC models capitalize on autoencoders to learn the intrinsic features which\nfacilitate the clustering process in consequence. Nowadays, a generative model\nnamed variational autoencoder (VAE) has got wide acceptance in DC studies.\nNevertheless, the plain VAE is insufficient to perceive the comprehensive\nlatent features, leading to the deteriorative clustering performance. In this\npaper, a novel DC method is proposed to address this issue. Specifically, the\ngenerative adversarial network and VAE are coalesced into a new autoencoder\ncalled fusion autoencoder (FAE) for discerning more discriminative\nrepresentation that benefits the downstream clustering task. Besides, the FAE\nis implemented with the deep residual network architecture which further\nenhances the representation learning ability. Finally, the latent space of the\nFAE is transformed to an embedding space shaped by a deep dense neural network\nfor pulling away different clusters from each other and collapsing data points\nwithin individual clusters.

    "abstract": "We propose a decentralised \"local2global\"' approach to graph representation\nlearning, that one can a-priori use to scale any embedding technique. Our\nlocal2global approach proceeds by first dividing the input graph into\noverlapping subgraphs (or \"patches\") and training local representations for\neach patch independently. In a second step, we combine the local\nrepresentations into a globally consistent representation by estimating the set\nof rigid motions that best align the local representations using information\nfrom the patch overlaps, via group synchronization. A key distinguishing\nfeature of local2global relative to existing work is that patches are trained\nindependently without the need for the often costly parameter synchronization\nduring distributed training. This allows local2global to scale to large-scale\nindustrial applications, where the input graph may not even fit into memory and\nmay be stored in a distributed manner. We apply local2global on data sets of\ndifferent sizes and show that our approach achieves a good trade-off between\nscale and accuracy on edge reconstruction and semi-supervised classification.\nWe also consider the downstream task of anomaly detection and show how one can\nuse local2global to highlight anomalies in cybersecurity networks.",

These\nmethods are successful in defending against gradient-based attacks; however,\nthey are easily circumvented by attacks which either do not use the gradient or\nby attacks which approximate and use the corrected gradient. Defenses that do\nnot obfuscate gradients such as adversarial training exist, but these\napproaches generally make assumptions about the attack such as its magnitude.\nWe propose a classification model that does not obfuscate gradients and is\nrobust by construction without assuming prior knowledge about the attack. Our\nmethod casts classification as an optimization problem where we \"invert\" a\nconditional generator trained on unperturbed, natural images to find the class\nthat generates the closest sample to the query image. We hypothesize that a\npotential source of brittleness against adversarial attacks is the\nhigh-to-low-dimensional nature of feed-forward classifiers which allows an\nadversary to find small perturbations in the input space that lead to large\nchanges in the output space. On the other hand, a generative model is typically\na low-to-high-dimensional mapping.

In the literature on POMDPs, it is\ncustomary to assume access to a planning oracle that computes an optimal policy\nwhen the parameters are known, even though the problem is known to be\ncomputationally hard. Almost all existing planning algorithms either run in\nexponential time, lack provable performance guarantees, or require placing\nstrong assumptions on the transition dynamics under every possible policy. In\nthis work, we revisit the planning problem and ask: are there natural and\nwell-motivated assumptions that make planning easy?\nOur main result is a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for planning in\n(one-step) observable POMDPs. Specifically, we assume that well-separated\ndistributions on states lead to well-separated distributions on observations,\nand thus the observations are at least somewhat informative in each step.\nCrucially, this assumption places no restrictions on the transition dynamics of\nthe POMDP; nevertheless, it implies that near-optimal policies admit\nquasi-succinct descriptions, which is not true in general (under standard\nhardness assumptions). Our analysis is based on new quantitative bounds for\nfilter stability -- i.e. the rate at which an optimal filter for the latent\nstate forgets its initialization.

It has now been increasingly leveraged in software systems to\nautomate the core tasks. However, how to securely develop the machine\nlearning-based modern software systems (MLBSS) remains a big challenge, for\nwhich the insufficient consideration will largely limit its application in\nsafety-critical domains. One concern is that the present MLBSS development\ntends to be rush, and the latent vulnerabilities and privacy issues exposed to\nexternal users and attackers will be largely neglected and hard to be\nidentified. Additionally, machine learning-based software systems exhibit\ndifferent liabilities towards novel vulnerabilities at different development\nstages from requirement analysis to system maintenance, due to its inherent\nlimitations from the model and data and the external adversary capabilities. In\nthis work, we consider that security for machine learning-based software\nsystems may arise by inherent system defects or external adversarial attacks,\nand the secure development practices should be taken throughout the whole\nlifecycle. While machine learning has become a new threat domain for existing\nsoftware engineering practices, there is no such review work covering the\ntopic. Overall, we present a holistic review regarding the security for MLBSS,\nwhich covers a systematic understanding from a structure review of three\ndistinct aspects in terms of security threats.

The automotive\nindustry is motivated on developing techniques to use sensors and advancements\nin the field of computer vision to build collision detection and collision\nprevention systems to assist drivers. In this article, a deep-learning-based\nmodel comprising of ResNext architecture with SENet blocks is proposed.

    "abstract": "We study the practical consequences of dataset sampling strategies on the\nranking performance of recommendation algorithms. Recommender systems are\ngenerally trained and evaluated on samples of larger datasets. Samples are\noften taken in a naive or ad-hoc fashion: e.g. by sampling a dataset randomly\nor by selecting users or items with many interactions. As we demonstrate,\ncommonly-used data sampling schemes can have significant consequences on\nalgorithm performance. Following this observation, this paper makes three main\ncontributions: (1) characterizing the effect of sampling on algorithm\nperformance, in terms of algorithm and dataset characteristics (e.g. sparsity\ncharacteristics, sequential dynamics, etc.); (2) designing SVP-CF, which is a\ndata-specific sampling strategy, that aims to preserve the relative performance\nof models after sampling, and is especially suited to long-tailed interaction\ndata; and (3) developing an oracle, Data-Genie, which can suggest the sampling\nscheme that is most likely to preserve model performance for a given dataset.\nThe main benefit of Data-Genie is that it will allow recommender system\npractitioners to quickly prototype and compare various approaches, while\nremaining confident that algorithm performance will be preserved, once the\nalgorithm is retrained and deployed on the complete data. Detailed experiments\nshow that using Data-Genie, we can discard upto 5x more data than any sampling\nstrategy with the same level of performance.",

    "abstract": "ML models are typically trained using large datasets of high quality.\nHowever, training datasets often contain inconsistent or incomplete data. To\ntackle this issue, one solution is to develop algorithms that can check whether\na prediction of a model is certifiably robust. Given a learning algorithm that\nproduces a classifier and given an example at test time, a classification\noutcome is certifiably robust if it is predicted by every model trained across\nall possible worlds (repairs) of the uncertain (inconsistent) dataset. This\nnotion of robustness falls naturally under the framework of certain answers. In\nthis paper, we study the complexity of certifying robustness for a simple but\nwidely deployed classification algorithm, $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN). Our\nmain focus is on inconsistent datasets when the integrity constraints are\nfunctional dependencies (FDs). For this setting, we establish a dichotomy in\nthe complexity of certifying robustness w.r.t. the set of FDs: the problem\neither admits a polynomial time algorithm, or it is coNP-hard. Additionally, we\nexhibit a similar dichotomy for the counting version of the problem, where the\ngoal is to count the number of possible worlds that predict a certain label. As\na byproduct of our study, we also establish the complexity of a problem related\nto finding an optimal subset repair that may be of independent interest.",

Recent years have seen the\nsuccessful application of deep learning to delineating field boundaries in\nindustrial agricultural systems, but field boundary datasets remain missing in\nsmallholder systems due to (1) small fields that require high resolution\nsatellite imagery to delineate and (2) a lack of ground labels for model\ntraining and validation. In this work, we combine transfer learning and weak\nsupervision to overcome these challenges, and we demonstrate the methods'\nsuccess in India where we efficiently generated 10,000 new field labels. Our\nbest model uses 1.5m resolution Airbus SPOT imagery as input, pre-trains a\nstate-of-the-art neural network on France field boundaries, and fine-tunes on\nIndia labels to achieve a median Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.86 in\nIndia.

We survey the recent advances, beginning with\nthe descriptions of masked facial detection datasets. Thirteen available\ndatasets are described and discussed in details. Then, the methods are roughly\ncategorized into two classes: conventional methods and neural network-based\nmethods. Conventional methods are usually trained by boosting algorithms with\nhand-crafted features, which accounts for a small proportion. Neural\nnetwork-based methods are further classified as three parts according to the\nnumber of processing stages. Representative algorithms are described in detail,\ncoupled with some typical techniques that are described briefly. Finally, we\nsummarize the recent benchmarking results, give the discussions on the\nlimitations of datasets and methods, and expand future research directions.

Optimal complexity is obtained when the\ncorrector possesses sufficient regularity with respect to both the fast and the\nslow variables. Although the regularity norm of the corrector depends on the\nsize of the truncated domain, we show that the convergence rate of the\napproximation for the solution to the homogenized equation is independent of\nthe size of the truncated domain.

To alleviate this, we propose to first\npredict semantic-level and instance-level correlations among different\nlocations that are utilized to enhance the backbone features, and then feed the\nimproved discriminative features into the corresponding segmentation heads,\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "Estimating instruction-level throughput is critical for many applications:\nmultimedia, low-latency networking, medical, automotive, avionic, and\nindustrial control systems all rely on tightly calculable and accurate timing\nbounds of their software. Unfortunately, how long a program may run - or if it\nmay indeed stop at all - cannot be answered in the general case. This is why\nstate-of-the-art throughput estimation tools usually focus on a subset of\noperations and make several simplifying assumptions. Correctly identifying\nthese sets of constraints and regions of interest in the program typically\nrequires source code, specialized tools, and dedicated expert knowledge.\nWhenever a single instruction is modified, this process must be repeated,\nincurring high costs when iteratively developing timing sensitive code in\npractice.\nIn this paper, we present MCAD, a novel and lightweight timing analysis\nframework that can identify the effects of code changes on the\nmicroarchitectural level for binary programs. MCAD provides accurate\ndifferential throughput estimates by emulating whole program execution using\nQEMU and forwarding traces to LLVM for instruction-level analysis. This allows\ndevelopers to iterate quickly, with low overhead, using common tools:\nidentifying execution paths that are less sensitive to changes over\ntiming-critical paths only takes minutes within MCAD. To the best of our\nknowledge this represents an entirely new capability that reduces turnaround\ntimes for differential throughput estimation by several orders of magnitude\ncompared to state-of-the-art tools. Our detailed evaluation shows that MCAD\nscales to real-world applications like FFmpeg and Clang with millions of\ninstructions, achieving < 3% geo mean error compared to ground truth timings\nfrom hardware-performance counters on x86 and ARM machines.",

One way to reduce costly labeling is\nto exploit self-structural information and inner-relations among unlabeled\nimages. Unlike the previous methods utilizing these relations and structural\ninformation from the original image level, we explore such self-relations from\nthe latent feature spaces because it can extract more abundant relations and\nstructural information.

One by-product is that our\nproposed S$^2$FPR method can leverage numerous partial orders in the latent\nspace among unlabeled images to strengthen the model representation capability\nand reduce the estimation errors for the crowd counting task.

It is a challenging\ntask, as we need to consider both complex intra-variable dependencies and\ninter-variable dependencies.

To reduce the reliance on labeled data, a new model called\nSnapshotNet is proposed as a self-supervised feature learning approach, which\ndirectly works on the unlabeled point cloud data of a complex 3D scene. The\nSnapshotNet pipeline includes three stages. In the snapshot capturing stage,\nsnapshots, which are defined as local collections of points, are sampled from\nthe point cloud scene. A snapshot could be a view of a local 3D scan directly\ncaptured from the real scene, or a virtual view of such from a large 3D point\ncloud dataset. Snapshots could also be sampled at different sampling rates or\nfields of view (FOVs), thus multi-FOV snapshots, to capture scale information\nfrom the scene. In the feature learning stage, a new pre-text task called\nmulti-FOV contrasting is proposed to recognize whether two snapshots are from\nthe same object or not, within the same FOV or across different FOVs. Snapshots\ngo through two self-supervised learning steps: the contrastive learning step\nwith both part and scale contrasting, followed by a snapshot clustering step to\nextract higher level semantic features. Then a weakly-supervised segmentation\nstage is implemented by first training a standard SVM classifier on the learned\nfeatures with a small fraction of labeled snapshots. The trained SVM is used to\npredict labels for input snapshots and predicted labels are converted into\npoint-wise label assignments for semantic segmentation of the entire scene\nusing a voting procedure. The experiments are conducted on the Semantic3D\ndataset and the results have shown that the proposed method is capable of\nlearning effective features from snapshots of complex scene data without any\nlabels.

LANCE features a\nText-To-Text-Transfer-Transformer (T5) model that has been trained on 6,894,456\nJava methods. LANCE takes as input a Java method and injects in it a full log\nstatement, including a human-comprehensible logging message and properly\nchoosing the needed log level and the statement location. Our results show that\nLANCE is able to (i) properly identify the location in the code where to inject\nthe statement in 65.9% of Java methods requiring it; (ii) selecting the proper\nlog level in 66.2% of cases; and (iii) generate a completely correct log\nstatement including a meaningful logging message in 15.2% of cases.",

    "abstract": "Extracting formal knowledge (ontologies) from natural language is a challenge\nthat can benefit from a (semi-) formal linguistic representation of texts, at\nthe semantic level. We propose to achieve such a representation by implementing\nthe Universal Networking Language (UNL) specifications on top of RDF. Thus, the\nmeaning of a statement in any language will be soundly expressed as a RDF-UNL\ngraph that constitutes a middle ground between natural language and formal\nknowledge. In particular, we show that RDF-UNL graphs can support content\nextraction using generic SHACL rules and that reasoning on the extracted facts\nallows detecting incoherence in the original texts.

In this paper, we propose knowledge graph BERT for\nlink prediction, named LP-BERT, which contains two training stages: multi-task\npre-training and knowledge graph fine-tuning. The pre-training strategy not\nonly uses Mask Language Model (MLM) to learn the knowledge of context corpus,\nbut also introduces Mask Entity Model (MEM) and Mask Relation Model (MRM),\nwhich can learn the relationship information from triples by predicting\nsemantic based entity and relation elements. Structured triple relation\ninformation can be transformed into unstructured semantic information, which\ncan be integrated into the pre-training model together with context corpus\ninformation. In the fine-tuning phase, inspired by contrastive learning, we\ncarry out a triple-style negative sampling in sample batch, which greatly\nincreased the proportion of negative sampling while keeping the training time\nalmost unchanged. Furthermore, we propose a data augmentation method based on\nthe inverse relationship of triples to further increase the sample diversity.\nWe achieve state-of-the-art results on WN18RR and UMLS datasets, especially the\nHits@10 indicator improved by 5\\% from the previous state-of-the-art result on\nWN18RR dataset.",

This work studies this question from the lens of a\npowerful informed adversary who knows all the training data points except one.\nBy instantiating concrete attacks, we show it is feasible to reconstruct the\nremaining data point in this stringent threat model. For convex models (e.g.\nlogistic regression), reconstruction attacks are simple and can be derived in\nclosed-form. For more general models (e.g. neural networks), we propose an\nattack strategy based on training a reconstructor network that receives as\ninput the weights of the model under attack and produces as output the target\ndata point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on image classifiers\ntrained on MNIST and CIFAR-10, and systematically investigate which factors of\nstandard machine learning pipelines affect reconstruction success. Finally, we\ntheoretically investigate what amount of differential privacy suffices to\nmitigate reconstruction attacks by informed adversaries. Our work provides an\neffective reconstruction attack that model developers can use to assess\nmemorization of individual points in general settings beyond those considered\nin previous works (e.g. generative language models or access to training\ngradients); it shows that standard models have the capacity to store enough\ninformation to enable high-fidelity reconstruction of training data points; and\nit demonstrates that differential privacy can successfully mitigate such\nattacks in a parameter regime where utility degradation is minimal.",

    "abstract": "Pre-training a model to learn transferable video-text representation for\nretrieval has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Previous dominant\nworks mainly adopt two separate encoders for efficient retrieval, but ignore\nlocal associations between videos and texts. Another line of research uses a\njoint encoder to interact video with texts, but results in low efficiency since\neach text-video pair needs to be fed into the model. In this work, we enable\nfine-grained video-text interactions while maintaining high efficiency for\nretrieval via a novel pretext task, dubbed as Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ),\nwhere a parametric module BridgeFormer is trained to answer the \"questions\"\nconstructed by the text features via resorting to the video features.\nSpecifically, we exploit the rich semantics of text (i.e., nouns and verbs) to\nbuild questions, with which the video encoder can be trained to capture more\nregional content and temporal dynamics. In the form of questions and answers,\nthe semantic associations between local video-text features can be properly\nestablished. BridgeFormer is able to be removed for downstream retrieval,\nrendering an efficient and flexible model with only two encoders. Our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on the popular text-to-video retrieval\ntask in five datasets with different experimental setups (i.e., zero-shot and\nfine-tune), including HowTo100M (one million videos). We further conduct\nzero-shot action recognition, which can be cast as video-to-text retrieval, and\nour approach also significantly surpasses its counterparts. As an additional\nbenefit, our method achieves competitive results with much shorter pre-training\nvideos on single-modality downstream tasks, e.g., action recognition with\nlinear evaluation.",

To address the limitations, recent work tackled few-shot\ndancing video retargeting, which learns to synthesize videos of unseen persons\nby leveraging a few frames of them.

In recent\nyears, using deep learning techniques to find heuristic solutions for NP-hard\ngraph combinatorial problems has gained much interest as these learned\nheuristics can find near-optimal solutions efficiently. However, most of the\nexisting methods for learning heuristics focus on static graph problems. The\ndynamic nature makes NP-hard graph problems much more challenging to learn, and\nthe existing methods fail to find reasonable solutions.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel architecture named Graph Temporal Attention\nwith Reinforcement Learning (GTA-RL) to learn heuristic solutions for\ngraph-based dynamic combinatorial optimization problems. The GTA-RL\narchitecture consists of an encoder capable of embedding temporal features of a\ncombinatorial problem instance and a decoder capable of dynamically focusing on\nthe embedded features to find a solution to a given combinatorial problem\ninstance. We then extend our architecture to learn heuristics for the real-time\nversion of combinatorial optimization problems where all input features of a\nproblem are not known a prior, but rather learned in real-time. Our\nexperimental results against several state-of-the-art learning-based algorithms\nand optimal solvers demonstrate that our approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art learning-based approaches in terms of effectiveness and\noptimal solvers in terms of efficiency on dynamic and real-time graph\ncombinatorial optimization.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have significantly enhanced the performance of single-image\nsuper-resolution (SR) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While there\ncan be many high-resolution (HR) solutions for a given input, most existing\nCNN-based methods do not explore alternative solutions during the inference. A\ntypical approach to obtaining alternative SR results is to train multiple SR\nmodels with different loss weightings and exploit the combination of these\nmodels. Instead of using multiple models, we present a more efficient method to\ntrain a single adjustable SR model on various combinations of losses by taking\nadvantage of multi-task learning. Specifically, we optimize an SR model with a\nconditional objective during training, where the objective is a weighted sum of\nmultiple perceptual losses at different feature levels. The weights vary\naccording to given conditions, and the set of weights is defined as a style\ncontroller. Also, we present an architecture appropriate for this training\nscheme, which is the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block equipped with spatial\nfeature transformation layers. At the inference phase, our trained model can\ngenerate locally different outputs conditioned on the style control map.\nExtensive experiments show that the proposed SR model produces various\ndesirable reconstructions without artifacts and yields comparable quantitative\nperformance to state-of-the-art SR methods.",

Smart\ncontracts are self-contained pieces of software that control assets, which are\noften of high financial value, in an adversarial environment and, once\ncommitted to the blockchain, they cannot be changed anymore. Smart contracts\nare typically developed in a high-level contract language and compiled to\nlow-level virtual machine code before being committed to the blockchain.

    "abstract": "Traffic forecasting models rely on data that needs to be sensed, processed,\nand stored. This requires the deployment and maintenance of traffic sensing\ninfrastructure, often leading to unaffordable monetary costs. The lack of\nsensed locations can be complemented with synthetic data simulations that\nfurther lower the economical investment needed for traffic monitoring. One of\nthe most common data generative approaches consists of producing real-like\ntraffic patterns, according to data distributions from analogous roads. The\nprocess of detecting roads with similar traffic is the key point of these\nsystems. However, without collecting data at the target location no flow\nmetrics can be employed for this similarity-based search. We present a method\nto discover locations among those with available traffic data by inspecting\ntopological features of road segments. Relevant topological features are\nextracted as numerical representations (embeddings) to compare different\nlocations and eventually find the most similar roads based on the similarity\nbetween their embeddings. The performance of this novel selection system is\nexamined and compared to simpler traffic estimation approaches. After finding a\nsimilar source of data, a generative method is used to synthesize traffic\nprofiles. Depending on the resemblance of the traffic behavior at the sensed\nroad, the generation method can be fed with data from one road only. Several\ngeneration approaches are analyzed in terms of the precision of the synthesized\nsamples.

    "abstract": "Camera-IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor fusion has been extensively\nstudied in recent decades. Numerous observability analysis and fusion schemes\nfor motion estimation with self-calibration have been presented. However, it\nhas been uncertain whether both camera and IMU intrinsic parameters are\nobservable under general motion. To answer this question, we first prove that\nfor a global shutter camera-IMU system, all intrinsic and extrinsic parameters\nare observable with an unknown landmark. Given this, time offset and readout\ntime of a rolling shutter (RS) camera also prove to be observable. Next, to\nvalidate this analysis and to solve the drift issue of a structureless filter\nduring standstills, we develop a Keyframe-based Sliding Window Filter (KSWF)\nfor odometry and self-calibration, which works with a monocular RS camera or\nstereo RS cameras. Though the keyframe concept is widely used in vision-based\nsensor fusion, to our knowledge, KSWF is the first of its kind to support\nself-calibration. Our simulation and real data tests validated that it is\npossible to fully calibrate the camera-IMU system using observations of\nopportunistic landmarks under diverse motion. Real data tests confirmed\nprevious allusions that keeping landmarks in the state vector can remedy the\ndrift in standstill, and showed that the keyframe-based scheme is an\nalternative cure.",

However, it is not clear whether such a critical period\nalso exists for the training of AI agents. Similar to human toddlers,\nwell-timed guidance and multimodal interactions might significantly enhance the\ntraining efficiency of AI agents as well. To validate this hypothesis, we adapt\nthis notion of critical periods to learning in AI agents and investigate the\ncritical period in the virtual environment for AI agents. We formalize the\ncritical period and Toddler-guidance learning in the reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework. Then, we built up a toddler-like environment with VECA toolkit\nto mimic human toddlers' learning characteristics. We study three discrete\nlevels of mutual interaction: weak-mentor guidance (sparse reward), moderate\nmentor guidance (helper-reward), and mentor demonstration (behavioral cloning).\nWe also introduce the EAVE dataset consisting of 30,000 real-world images to\nfully reflect the toddler's viewpoint. We evaluate the impact of critical\nperiods on AI agents from two perspectives: how and when they are guided best\nin both uni- and multimodal learning. Our experimental results show that both\nuni- and multimodal agents with moderate mentor guidance and critical period on\n1 million and 2 million training steps show a noticeable improvement.

In the term\n\"memory-efficient\" SSE, we encompass both the goals of local SSE, and\npage-efficient SSE. The centerpiece of our approach is a novel connection\nbetween those two goals. We introduce a map, called the Generic Local\nTransform, which takes as input a page-efficient SSE scheme with certain\nspecial features, and outputs an SSE scheme with strong locality properties. We\nobtain several results.\n(1) First, for page-efficient SSE, we build a dynamic scheme with page\nefficiency $O(\\log \\log N)$ and storage efficiency $O(1)$, called LayeredSSE.\nThe main technical innovation behind LayeredSSE is a new weighted extension of\nthe two-choice allocation process, of independent interest.\n(2) Second, we introduce the Generic Local Transform, and combine it with\nLayeredSSE to build a dynamic SSE scheme with storage efficiency $O(1)$,\nlocality $O(1)$, and read efficiency $O(\\log\\log N)$, under the condition that\nthe longest list is of size $O(N^{1-1/\\log \\log \\lambda})$. This matches, in\nevery respect, the purely static construction of Asharov et al. presented at\nSTOC 2016: dynamism comes at no extra cost.\n(3) Finally, by applying the Generic Local Transform to a variant of the\nTethys scheme by Bossuat et al. from Crypto 2021, we build an unconditional\nstatic SSE with storage efficiency $O(1)$, locality $O(1)$, and read efficiency\n$O(\\log^\\varepsilon N)$, for an arbitrarily small constant $\\varepsilon > 0$.\nTo our knowledge, this is the construction that comes closest to the lower\nbound presented by Cash and Tessaro at Eurocrypt 2014.",

However, its widespread\napplicability is limited by the fact that it is difficult to draw a complete\nsketch for most people, and the drawing process often takes time. In this\nstudy, we aim to retrieve the target photo with the least number of strokes\npossible (incomplete sketch), named on-the-fly FG-SBIR (Bhunia et al. 2020),\nwhich starts retrieving at each stroke as soon as the drawing begins. We\nconsider that there is a significant correlation among these incomplete\nsketches in the sketch drawing episode of each photo. To learn more efficient\njoint embedding space shared between the photo and its incomplete sketches, we\npropose a multi-granularity association learning framework that further\noptimizes the embedding space of all incomplete sketches. Specifically, based\non the integrity of the sketch, we can divide a complete sketch episode into\nseveral stages, each of which corresponds to a simple linear mapping layer.\nMoreover, our framework guides the vector space representation of the current\nsketch to approximate that of its later sketches to realize the retrieval\nperformance of the sketch with fewer strokes to approach that of the sketch\nwith more strokes.

    "abstract": "The marine ecosystem is changing at an alarming rate, exhibiting biodiversity\nloss and the migration of tropical species to temperate basins. Monitoring the\nunderwater environments and their inhabitants is of fundamental importance to\nunderstand the evolution of these systems and implement safeguard policies.\nHowever, assessing and tracking biodiversity is often a complex task,\nespecially in large and uncontrolled environments, such as the oceans. One of\nthe most popular and effective methods for monitoring marine biodiversity is\npassive acoustics monitoring (PAM), which employs hydrophones to capture\nunderwater sound. Many aquatic animals produce sounds characteristic of their\nown species; these signals travel efficiently underwater and can be detected\neven at great distances. Furthermore, modern technologies are becoming more and\nmore convenient and precise, allowing for very accurate and careful data\nacquisition. To date, audio captured with PAM devices is frequently manually\nprocessed by marine biologists and interpreted with traditional signal\nprocessing techniques for the detection of animal vocalizations. This is a\nchallenging task, as PAM recordings are often over long periods of time.\nMoreover, one of the causes of biodiversity loss is sound pollution; in data\nobtained from regions with loud anthropic noise, it is hard to separate the\nartificial from the fish sound manually. Nowadays, machine learning and, in\nparticular, deep learning represents the state of the art for processing audio\nsignals. Specifically, sound separation networks are able to identify and\nseparate human voices and musical instruments. In this work, we show that the\nsame techniques can be successfully used to automatically extract fish\nvocalizations in PAM recordings, opening up the possibility for biodiversity\nmonitoring at a large scale.",

    "abstract": "Since sparse neural networks usually contain many zero weights, these\nunnecessary network connections can potentially be eliminated without degrading\nnetwork performance. Therefore, well-designed sparse neural networks have the\npotential to significantly reduce FLOPs and computational resources. In this\nwork, we propose a new automatic pruning method - Sparse Connectivity Learning\n(SCL). Specifically, a weight is re-parameterized as an element-wise\nmultiplication of a trainable weight variable and a binary mask. Thus, network\nconnectivity is fully described by the binary mask, which is modulated by a\nunit step function. We theoretically prove the fundamental principle of using a\nstraight-through estimator (STE) for network pruning. This principle is that\nthe proxy gradients of STE should be positive, ensuring that mask variables\nconverge at their minima. After finding Leaky ReLU, Softplus, and Identity STEs\ncan satisfy this principle, we propose to adopt Identity STE in SCL for\ndiscrete mask relaxation. We find that mask gradients of different features are\nvery unbalanced, hence, we propose to normalize mask gradients of each feature\nto optimize mask variable training. In order to automatically train sparse\nmasks, we include the total number of network connections as a regularization\nterm in our objective function. As SCL does not require pruning criteria or\nhyper-parameters defined by designers for network layers, the network is\nexplored in a larger hypothesis space to achieve optimized sparse connectivity\nfor the best performance. SCL overcomes the limitations of existing automatic\npruning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that SCL can automatically\nlearn and select important network connections for various baseline network\nstructures. Deep learning models trained by SCL outperform the SOTA\nhuman-designed and automatic pruning methods in sparsity, accuracy, and FLOPs\nreduction.",

More\nspecifically, we propose a multi-task framework to learn a contouring\nadaptation network along with a semantic segmentation adaptation network, which\ntakes both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slice and its initial edge map as\ninput.~These two networks are jointly trained with source domain labels, and\nthe feature and edge map level adversarial learning is carried out for\ncross-domain alignment. In addition, self-entropy minimization is incorporated\nto further enhance segmentation performance. We evaluated our framework on the\nBraTS2018 database for cross-modality segmentation of brain tumors, showing the\nvalidity and superiority of our approach, compared with competing methods.",

    "abstract": "Representing scenes with multiple semi-transparent colored layers has been a\npopular and successful choice for real-time novel view synthesis. Existing\napproaches infer colors and transparency values over regularly-spaced layers of\nplanar or spherical shape. In this work, we introduce a new view synthesis\napproach based on multiple semi-transparent layers with scene-adapted geometry.\nOur approach infers such representations from stereo pairs in two stages. The\nfirst stage infers the geometry of a small number of data-adaptive layers from\na given pair of views. The second stage infers the color and the transparency\nvalues for these layers producing the final representation for novel view\nsynthesis. Importantly, both stages are connected through a differentiable\nrenderer and are trained in an end-to-end manner. In the experiments, we\ndemonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach over the use of\nregularly-spaced layers with no adaptation to scene geometry. Despite being\norders of magnitude faster during rendering, our approach also outperforms a\nrecently proposed IBRNet system based on implicit geometry representation.

In this paper, we present TransVOD, the first end-to-end video object\ndetection system based on spatial-temporal Transformer architectures. The first\ngoal of this paper is to streamline the pipeline of VOD, effectively removing\nthe need for many hand-crafted components for feature aggregation, e.g.,\noptical flow model, relation networks. Besides, benefited from the object query\ndesign in DETR, our method does not need complicated post-processing methods\nsuch as Seq-NMS. In particular, we present a temporal Transformer to aggregate\nboth the spatial object queries and the feature memories of each frame. Our\ntemporal transformer consists of two components: Temporal Query Encoder (TQE)\nto fuse object queries, and Temporal Deformable Transformer Decoder (TDTD) to\nobtain current frame detection results. These designs boost the strong baseline\ndeformable DETR by a significant margin (3%-4% mAP) on the ImageNet VID\ndataset. Then, we present two improved versions of TransVOD including\nTransVOD++ and TransVOD Lite. The former fuses object-level information into\nobject query via dynamic convolution while the latter models the entire video\nclips as the output to speed up the inference time. We give detailed analysis\nof all three models in the experiment part. In particular, our proposed\nTransVOD++ sets a new state-of-the-art record in terms of accuracy on ImageNet\nVID with 90.0% mAP. Our proposed TransVOD Lite also achieves the best speed and\naccuracy trade-off with 83.7% mAP while running at around 30 FPS on a single\nV100 GPU device.

Our experiments on three models and three datasets show\nthat the adversarial prediction increases the prediction error by more than\n150%.

Previous optimisation-based motion planning approaches that use\ndistance fields have suffered from the high computational cost required to\nupdate the environment representation.

This novel framework merges structural similarities in networks and\nvector features of words, which can be combined or explored independently.\nSimilarities model heterogenous word associations across\nsemantic/syntactic/phonological aspects of knowledge. Words are enriched with\nmulti-dimensional feature embeddings including frequency, age of acquisition,\nlength and polysemy. These aspects enable unprecedented explorations of\ncognitive knowledge. Through CHILDES data, we use FERMULEX networks to model\nnormative language acquisition by 1000 toddlers between 18 and 30 months.\nSimilarities and embeddings capture word homophily via conformity, which\nmeasures assortative mixing via distance and features. Conformity unearths a\nlanguage kernel of frequent/polysemous/short nouns and verbs key for basic\nsentence production, supporting recent evidence of children's syntactic\nconstructs emerging at 30 months. This kernel is invisible to network\ncore-detection and feature-only clustering: It emerges from the dual\nvector/network nature of words.

Since MTC devices are mostly disconnected from Base\nStation (BS) for power saving, random access procedure is required for devices\nto transmit data. If many devices try random access simultaneously, preamble\ncollision problem occurs, thus causing latency increase. In an environment\nwhere delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant devices coexist, the contention-based\nrandom access procedure cannot satisfy latency requirements of delay-sensitive\ndevices. Therefore, we propose RAPID, a novel random access procedure, which is\ncompleted through two message exchanges for the delay-sensitive devices. We\nalso develop Access Pattern Analyzer (APA), which estimates traffic\ncharacteristics of MTC devices. When UEs, performing RAPID and contention-based\nrandom access, coexist, it is important to determine a value which is the\nnumber of preambles for RAPID to reduce random access load. Thus, we analyze\nrandom access load using a Markov chain model to obtain the optimal number of\npreambles for RAPID.

Both, OLS\nregression analysis and Random Forest machine learning algorithms are applied\nto quantify factors for county-level vaccination hesitancy. The machine\nlearning model considers joint effects of variables (race/ethnicity,\npartisanship, age, etc.) simultaneously to capture the unique combination of\nthese factors on the vaccination rate. By implementing a state-of-the-art\nArtificial Intelligence Explanations (AIX) algorithm, it is possible to solve\nthe black box problem with machine learning models and provide answers to the\n\"how much\" question for each measured impact factor in every county. For most\ncounties, a higher percentage vote for Republicans, a greater African American\npopulation share, and a higher poverty rate lower the vaccination rate. While a\nhigher Asian population share increases the predicted vaccination rate. The\nimpact on the vaccination rate from the Hispanic population proportion is\npositive in the OLS model, but only positive for counties with a high Hispanic\npopulation (>65%) in the Random Forest model. Both the proportion of seniors\nand the one for young people in a county have a significant impact in the OLS\nmodel - positive and negative, respectively. In contrast, the impacts are\nambiguous in the Random Forest model. Because results vary between geographies\nand since the AIX algorithm is able to quantify vaccine impacts individually\nfor each county, this research can be tailored to local communities. An\ninteractive online mapping dashboard that identifies impact factors for\nindividual U.S. counties is available at\nhttps://www.cpp.edu/~clange/vacmap.html.

    "title": "Evaluation of Neural Networks Defenses and Attacks using NDCG and  Reciprocal Rank Metrics",
    "abstract": "The problem of attacks on neural networks through input modification (i.e.,\nadversarial examples) has attracted much attention recently. Being relatively\neasy to generate and hard to detect, these attacks pose a security breach that\nmany suggested defenses try to mitigate. However, the evaluation of the effect\nof attacks and defenses commonly relies on traditional classification metrics,\nwithout adequate adaptation to adversarial scenarios. Most of these metrics are\naccuracy-based, and therefore may have a limited scope and low distinctive\npower. Other metrics do not consider the unique characteristics of neural\nnetworks functionality, or measure the effect of the attacks indirectly (e.g.,\nthrough the complexity of their generation). In this paper, we present two\nmetrics which are specifically designed to measure the effect of attacks, or\nthe recovery effect of defenses, on the output of neural networks in multiclass\nclassification tasks. Inspired by the normalized discounted cumulative gain and\nthe reciprocal rank metrics used in information retrieval literature, we treat\nthe neural network predictions as ranked lists of results. Using additional\ninformation about the probability of the rank enabled us to define novel\nmetrics that are suited to the task at hand. We evaluate our metrics using\nvarious attacks and defenses on a pretrained VGG19 model and the ImageNet\ndataset. Compared to the common classification metrics, our proposed metrics\ndemonstrate superior informativeness and distinctiveness.",

    "abstract": "Several manufacturers have already started to commercialize near-bank\nProcessing-In-Memory (PIM) architectures. Near-bank PIM architectures place\nsimple cores close to DRAM banks and can yield significant performance and\nenergy improvements in parallel applications by alleviating data access costs.\nReal PIM systems can provide high levels of parallelism, large aggregate memory\nbandwidth and low memory access latency, thereby being a good fit to accelerate\nthe widely-used, memory-bound Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication (SpMV)\nkernel.\nThis paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of SpMV on a real-world\nPIM architecture, and presents SparseP, the first SpMV library for real PIM\narchitectures. We make three key contributions. First, we implement a wide\nvariety of software strategies on SpMV for a multithreaded PIM core and\ncharacterize the computational limits of a single multithreaded PIM core.\nSecond, we design various load balancing schemes across multiple PIM cores, and\ntwo types of data partitioning techniques to execute SpMV on thousands of PIM\ncores: (1) 1D-partitioned kernels to perform the complete SpMV computation only\nusing PIM cores, and (2) 2D-partitioned kernels to strive a balance between\ncomputation and data transfer costs to PIM-enabled memory. Third, we compare\nSpMV execution on a real-world PIM system with 2528 PIM cores to\nstate-of-the-art CPU and GPU systems to study the performance and energy\nefficiency of various devices. SparseP software package provides 25 SpMV\nkernels for real PIM systems supporting the four most widely used compressed\nmatrix formats, and a wide range of data types. Our extensive evaluation\nprovides new insights and recommendations for software designers and hardware\narchitects to efficiently accelerate SpMV on real PIM systems.",

The key idea of these methods, lies in the transformation of\nthe coordinates of the nonlinear system into the Koopman observables, which are\ncoordinates that allow the representation of the original system (control\nsystem) as a higher dimensional linear (bilinear control) system.

    "abstract": "Makespan minimization on parallel identical machines is a classical and\nintensively studied problem in scheduling, and a classic example for online\nalgorithm analysis with Graham's famous list scheduling algorithm dating back\nto the 1960s. In this problem, jobs arrive over a list and upon an arrival, the\nalgorithm needs to assign the job to a machine. The goal is to minimize the\nmakespan, that is, the maximum machine load. In this paper, we consider the\nvariant with an additional cardinality constraint: The algorithm may assign at\nmost $k$ jobs to each machine where $k$ is part of the input. While the offline\n(strongly NP-hard) variant of cardinality constrained scheduling is well\nunderstood and an EPTAS exists here, no non-trivial results are known for the\nonline variant. We fill this gap by making a comprehensive study of various\ndifferent online models. First, we show that there is a constant competitive\nalgorithm for the problem and further, present a lower bound of $2$ on the\ncompetitive ratio of any online algorithm. Motivated by the lower bound, we\nconsider a semi-online variant where upon arrival of a job of size $p$, we are\nallowed to migrate jobs of total size at most a constant times $p$. This\nconstant is called the migration factor of the algorithm. Algorithms with small\nmigration factors are a common approach to bridge the performance of online\nalgorithms and offline algorithms. One can obtain algorithms with a constant\nmigration factor by rounding the size of each incoming job and then applying an\nordinal algorithm to the resulting rounded instance. With this in mind, we also\nconsider the framework of ordinal algorithms and characterize the competitive\nratio that can be achieved using the aforementioned approaches.",

    "abstract": "We consider the construction of a polyhedral Delaunay partition as a limit of\nthe sequence of power diagrams (radical partitions). The dual Voronoi diagram\nis obtained as a limit of the sequence of weighted Delaunay partitions. The\nproblem is reduced to the construction of two dual convex polyhedra, inscribed\nand superscribed around a circular paraboloid, as a limit of the sequence of\npairs of general dual convex polyhedra. The sequence of primal polyhedra should\nconverge to the superscribed polyhedron and the sequence of the dual polyhedra\nconverges to the inscribed polyhedron.\nWe are interested in the case when the vertices of primal polyhedra can move\nor merge together, i.e., no new faces are allowed for dual polyhedra. These\nrules define the transformation of the set of initial spheres into the set of\nDelaunay spheres using radius variation and sphere movement and elimination.\nExistence theorems are still unavailable but we suggest a functional measuring\nthe deviation of the convex polyhedron from the one inscribed into the\nparaboloid. It is the discrete Dirichlet functional for the power function\nwhich is a linear interpolant of the vertical distance of the dual vertices\nfrom the paraboloid. The functional's absolute minimizer is attained on the\nconstant power field, meaning that the inscribed polyhedron can be obtained by\na simple translation. This formulation of the functional for the dual surface\nis not quadratic since the unknowns are the vertices of the primal polyhedron,\nhence, the transformation of the set of spheres into Delaunay spheres is not\nunique.\nWe concentrate on the experimental confirmation of the approach viability and\nput aside mesh quality problems.

Takens' theorem provides conditions for when it is possible to\naugment these partial measurements with time delayed information, resulting in\nan attractor that is diffeomorphic to that of the original full-state system.\nHowever, the coordinate transformation back to the original attractor is\ntypically unknown, and learning the dynamics in the embedding space has\nremained an open challenge for decades. Here, we design a custom deep\nautoencoder network to learn a coordinate transformation from the delay\nembedded space into a new space where it is possible to represent the dynamics\nin a sparse, closed form. We demonstrate this approach on the Lorenz,\nR\\\"ossler, and Lotka-Volterra systems, learning dynamics from a single\nmeasurement variable. As a challenging example, we learn a Lorenz analogue from\na single scalar variable extracted from a video of a chaotic waterwheel\nexperiment. The resulting modeling framework combines deep learning to uncover\neffective coordinates and the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics\n(SINDy) for interpretable modeling.

Even when\nadversarially trained, their performance on perturbed inputs (robust\ngeneralization) is considerably worse than their best attainable performance on\nbenign inputs (standard generalization). It is thus imperative to understand\nhow overparametrization fundamentally affects robustness.\nIn this paper, we will provide a precise characterization of the role of\noverparametrization on robustness by focusing on random features regression\nmodels (two-layer neural networks with random first layer weights). We consider\na regime where the sample size, the input dimension and the number of\nparameters grow in proportion to each other, and derive an asymptotically exact\nformula for the robust generalization error when the model is adversarially\ntrained.

Few-shot learning aims to alleviate this issue by learning\neffectively from few labelled examples. In previously proposed few-shot visual\nclassifiers, it is assumed that the feature manifold, where classifier\ndecisions are made, has uncorrelated feature dimensions and uniform feature\nvariance. In this work, we focus on addressing the limitations arising from\nthis assumption by proposing a variance-sensitive class of models that operates\nin a low-label regime. The first method, Simple CNAPS, employs a hierarchically\nregularized Mahalanobis-distance based classifier combined with a state of the\nart neural adaptive feature extractor to achieve strong performance on\nMeta-Dataset, mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet benchmarks. We further extend\nthis approach to a transductive learning setting, proposing Transductive CNAPS.\nThis transductive method combines a soft k-means parameter refinement procedure\nwith a two-step task encoder to achieve improved test-time classification\naccuracy using unlabelled data. Transductive CNAPS achieves state of the art\nperformance on Meta-Dataset. Finally, we explore the use of our methods (Simple\nand Transductive) for \"out of the box\" continual and active learning.

The current diagnostic procedure\nuses patient assessments to evaluate symptoms and sometimes a magnetic\nresonance imaging or MRI scan. However, symptom variations cause inaccurate\nassessments, and the analysis of MRI scans requires experienced specialists.\nThis research proposes to accurately diagnose PD severity with deep learning by\ncombining symptoms data and MRI data from the Parkinsons Progression Markers\nInitiative database. A new hybrid model architecture was implemented to fully\nutilize both forms of clinical data, and models based on only symptoms and only\nMRI scans were also developed. The symptoms based model integrates a fully\nconnected deep learning neural network, and the MRI scans and hybrid models\nintegrate transfer learning based convolutional neural networks. Instead of\nperforming only binary classification, all models diagnose patients into five\nseverity categories, with stage zero representing healthy patients and stages\nfour and five representing patients with PD. The symptoms only, MRI scans only,\nand hybrid models achieved accuracies of 0.77, 0.68, and 0.94, respectively.\nThe hybrid model also had high precision and recall scores of 0.94 and 0.95.\nReal clinical cases confirm the strong performance of the hybrid, where\npatients were classified incorrectly with both other models but correctly by\nthe hybrid. It is also consistent across the five severity stages, indicating\naccurate early detection.

    "abstract": "The prediction of microsatellite instability (MSI) and microsatellite\nstability (MSS) is essential in predicting both the treatment response and\nprognosis of gastrointestinal cancer. In clinical practice, a universal MSI\ntesting is recommended, but the accessibility of such a test is limited. Thus,\na more cost-efficient and broadly accessible tool is desired to cover the\ntraditionally untested patients. In the past few years, deep-learning-based\nalgorithms have been proposed to predict MSI directly from haematoxylin and\neosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs). Such algorithms can be\nsummarized as (1) patch-level MSI/MSS prediction, and (2) patient-level\naggregation. Compared with the advanced deep learning approaches that have been\nemployed for the first stage, only the na\\\"ive first-order statistics (e.g.,\naveraging and counting) were employed in the second stage. In this paper, we\npropose a simple yet broadly generalizable patient-level MSI aggregation (MAg)\nmethod to effectively integrate the precious patch-level information. Briefly,\nthe entire probabilistic distribution in the first stage is modeled as\nhistogram-based features to be fused as the final outcome with machine learning\n(e.g., SVM). The proposed MAg method can be easily used in a plug-and-play\nmanner, which has been evaluated upon five broadly used deep neural networks:\nResNet, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, Dpn and ResNext. From the results, the\nproposed MAg method consistently improves the accuracy of patient-level\naggregation for two publicly available datasets. It is our hope that the\nproposed method could potentially leverage the low-cost H&E based MSI detection\nmethod.

    "abstract": "Various deep learning models have been developed to segment anatomical\nstructures from medical images, but they typically have poor performance when\ntested on another target domain with different data distribution. Recently,\nunsupervised domain adaptation methods have been proposed to alleviate this\nso-called domain shift issue, but most of them are designed for scenarios with\nrelatively small domain shifts and are likely to fail when encountering a large\ndomain gap. In this paper, we propose DCDA, a novel cross-modality unsupervised\ndomain adaptation framework for tasks with large domain shifts, e.g.,\nsegmenting retinal vessels from OCTA and OCT images. DCDA mainly consists of a\ndisentangling representation style transfer (DRST) module and a collaborative\nconsistency learning (CCL) module. DRST decomposes images into content\ncomponents and style codes and performs style transfer and image\nreconstruction. CCL contains two segmentation models, one for source domain and\nthe other for target domain. The two models use labeled data (together with the\ncorresponding transferred images) for supervised learning and perform\ncollaborative consistency learning on unlabeled data. Each model focuses on the\ncorresponding single domain and aims to yield an expertized domain-specific\nsegmentation model. Through extensive experiments on retinal vessel\nsegmentation, our framework achieves Dice scores close to target-trained oracle\nboth from OCTA to OCT and from OCT to OCTA, significantly outperforming other\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

Therefore, various\ndiagnostic mechanisms are used. Additionally to the RT-PCR test, medical\nimaging methods have been utilized, especially in the detection of COVID19(+)\npatients. In this study, an alternative approach was proposed by using cough\ndata, which is one of the most prominent symptoms of COVID19(+) patients. The\ncough acoustic public dataset on the Virufy website was used. The entire data\nwas normalized using z-normalization technique. The performance of the features\nobtained via the 5-layer empirical mode decomposition method and the\nperformances of different classifiers has been compared. As the classifier\nalgorithm, 5 different algorithms were used. The highest accuracy and F1-score\nperformances were obtained by using Ensemble-Bagged-Trees algorithm as 90.6%\nand 90.5%, respectively. On the other hand, other classification algorithms\nused in the study are Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Linear\nDiscriminant Analysis and k-Nearest Neigbors, respectively.

In order to make advances in ALD process development, which is utilized\nto generate thin films, and its subsequent accelerated adoption in industry, it\nis imperative to understand the underlying atomistic processes. Towards this\nend, in situ techniques for monitoring film growth, such as Spectroscopic\nEllipsometry (SE), have been proposed.

Current models of epidemics are classified as either\nmechanistic or non-mechanistic: mechanistic models make explicit assumptions on\nthe dynamics of disease, whereas non-mechanistic models make assumptions on the\nform of observed time series. Here, we introduce a simple mixture-based model\nwhich bridges the two approaches while retaining benefits of both.

    "abstract": "Adaptive partial linear beamforming meets the need of 5G and future 6G\napplications for high flexibility and adaptability. Choosing an appropriate\ntradeoff between conflicting goals opens the recently proposed multiuser (MU)\ndetection method. Due to their high spatial resolution, nonlinear beamforming\nfilters can significantly outperform linear approaches in stationary scenarios\nwith massive connectivity. However, a dramatic decrease in performance can be\nexpected in high mobility scenarios because they are very susceptible to\nchanges in the wireless channel. The robustness of linear filters is required,\nconsidering these changes. One way to respond appropriately is to use online\nmachine learning algorithms. The theory of algorithms based on the adaptive\nprojected subgradient method (APSM) is rich, and they promise accurate tracking\ncapabilities in dynamic wireless environments. However, one of the main\nchallenges comes from the real-time implementation of these algorithms, which\ninvolve projections on time-varying closed convex sets. While the projection\noperations are relatively simple, their vast number poses a challenge in\nultralow latency (ULL) applications where latency constraints must be satisfied\nin every radio frame. Taking non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems as\nan example, this paper explores the acceleration of APSM-based algorithms\nthrough massive parallelization. The result is a GPU-accelerated real-time\nimplementation of an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based\ntransceiver that enables detection latency of less than one millisecond and\ntherefore complies with the requirements of 5G and beyond.

    "abstract": "Machine learning techniques typically applied to dementia forecasting lack in\ntheir capabilities to jointly learn several tasks, handle time dependent\nheterogeneous data and missing values. In this paper, we propose a framework\nusing the recently presented SSHIBA model for jointly learning different tasks\non longitudinal data with missing values. The method uses Bayesian variational\ninference to impute missing values and combine information of several views.\nThis way, we can combine different data-views from different time-points in a\ncommon latent space and learn the relations between each time-point while\nsimultaneously modelling and predicting several output variables. We apply this\nmodel to predict together diagnosis, ventricle volume, and clinical scores in\ndementia. The results demonstrate that SSHIBA is capable of learning a good\nimputation of the missing values and outperforming the baselines while\nsimultaneously predicting three different tasks.",

    "abstract": "Neyman-Scott process (NSP) are point process models that generate clusters of\npoints in time or space. They are natural models for a wide range of phenomena,\nranging from neural spike trains to document streams. The clustering property\nis achieved via a doubly stochastic formulation: first, a set of latent events\nis drawn from a Poisson process; then, each latent event generates a set of\nobserved data points according to another Poisson process. This construction is\nsimilar to Bayesian nonparametric mixture models like the Dirichlet process\nmixture model (DPMM) in that the number of latent events (i.e. clusters) is a\nrandom variable, but the point process formulation makes the NSP especially\nwell suited to modeling spatiotemporal data. While many specialized algorithms\nhave been developed for DPMMs, comparatively fewer works have focused on\ninference in NSPs. Here, we present novel connections between NSPs and DPMMs,\nwith the key link being a third class of Bayesian mixture models called mixture\nof finite mixture models (MFMMs). Leveraging this connection, we adapt the\nstandard collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for DPMMs to enable scalable\nBayesian inference on NSP models. We demonstrate the potential of Neyman-Scott\nprocesses on a variety of applications including sequence detection in neural\nspike trains and event detection in document streams.",

    "title": "A robust kernel machine regression towards biomarker selection in  multi-omics datasets of osteoporosis for drug discovery",
    "abstract": "Many statistical machine approaches could ultimately highlight novel features\nof the etiology of complex diseases by analyzing multi-omics data. However,\nthey are sensitive to some deviations in distribution when the observed samples\nare potentially contaminated with adversarial corrupted outliers (e.g., a\nfictional data distribution). Likewise, statistical advances lag in supporting\ncomprehensive data-driven analyses of complex multi-omics data integration. We\npropose a novel non-linear M-estimator-based approach, \"robust kernel machine\nregression (RobKMR),\" to improve the robustness of statistical machine\nregression and the diversity of fictional data to examine the higher-order\ncomposite effect of multi-omics datasets. We address a robust kernel-centered\nGram matrix to estimate the model parameters accurately. We also propose a\nrobust score test to assess the marginal and joint Hadamard product of features\nfrom multi-omics data. We apply our proposed approach to a multi-omics dataset\nof osteoporosis (OP) from Caucasian females. Experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed approach effectively identifies the inter-related risk factors of OP.\nWith solid evidence (p-value = 0.00001), biological validations, network-based\nanalysis, causal inference, and drug repurposing, the selected three triplets\n((DKK1, SMTN, DRGX), (MTND5, FASTKD2, CSMD3), (MTND5, COG3, CSMD3)) are\nsignificant biomarkers and directly relate to BMD. Overall, the top three\nselected genes (DKK1, MTND5, FASTKD2) and one gene (SIDT1 at p-value= 0.001)\nsignificantly bond with four drugs- Tacrolimus, Ibandronate, Alendronate, and\nBazedoxifene out of 30 candidates for drug repurposing in OP. Further, the\nproposed approach can be applied to any disease model where multi-omics\ndatasets are available.",

In particular, a continuous model\nof the hard sphere fluid is studied. There are two main proposals in this\ncontribution. First, the use of neural networks as a way to parametrize closure\nrelation when solving the Ornstein-Zernike equation. It is explicitly shown\nthat in the case of the hard sphere fluid, the neural network approach seems to\nreduce to the so-called Hypernetted Chain closure. For the second proposal, we\nexplore the fact that if more physical information is incorporated into the\ntheoretical formalism, a better estimate can be obtained with the use of\nevolutionary optimization techniques. When choosing the modified Verlet closure\nrelation, and leaving a couple of free parameters to be adjusted, the results\nare as good as those obtained from molecular simulations. The thesis is then\nclosed with a brief summary of the main findings and outlooks on different ways\nto improve the proposals presented here.",

    "abstract": "The increasing automation in many areas of the Industry expressly demands to\ndesign efficient machine-learning solutions for the detection of abnormal\nevents. With the ubiquitous deployment of sensors monitoring nearly\ncontinuously the health of complex infrastructures, anomaly detection can now\nrely on measurements sampled at a very high frequency, providing a very rich\nrepresentation of the phenomenon under surveillance. In order to exploit fully\nthe information thus collected, the observations cannot be treated as\nmultivariate data anymore and a functional analysis approach is required. It is\nthe purpose of this paper to investigate the performance of recent techniques\nfor anomaly detection in the functional setup on real datasets. After an\noverview of the state-of-the-art and a visual-descriptive study, a variety of\nanomaly detection methods are compared. While taxonomies of abnormalities (e.g.\nshape, location) in the functional setup are documented in the literature,\nassigning a specific type to the identified anomalies appears to be a\nchallenging task. Thus, strengths and weaknesses of the existing approaches are\nbenchmarked in view of these highlighted types in a simulation study. Anomaly\ndetection methods are next evaluated on two datasets, related to the monitoring\nof helicopters in flight and to the spectrometry of construction materials\nnamely. The benchmark analysis is concluded by recommendation guidance for\npractitioners.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to describe a novel non-parametric noise reduction\ntechnique from the point of view of Bayesian inference that may automatically\nimprove the signal-to-noise ratio of one- and two-dimensional data, such as\ne.g. astronomical images and spectra. The algorithm iteratively evaluates\npossible smoothed versions of the data, the smooth models, obtaining an\nestimation of the underlying signal that is statistically compatible with the\nnoisy measurements. Iterations stop based on the evidence and the $\\chi^2$\nstatistic of the last smooth model, and we compute the expected value of the\nsignal as a weighted average of the whole set of smooth models. In this paper,\nwe explain the mathematical formalism and numerical implementation of the\nalgorithm, and we evaluate its performance in terms of the peak signal to noise\nratio, the structural similarity index, and the time payload, using a battery\nof real astronomical observations. Our Fully Adaptive Bayesian Algorithm for\nData Analysis (FABADA) yields results that, without any parameter tuning, are\ncomparable to standard image processing algorithms whose parameters have been\noptimized based on the true signal to be recovered, something that is\nimpossible in a real application. State-of-the-art non-parametric methods, such\nas BM3D, offer slightly better performance at high signal-to-noise ratio, while\nour algorithm is significantly more accurate for extremely noisy data (higher\nthan $20-40\\%$ relative errors, a situation of particular interest in the field\nof astronomy). In this range, the standard deviation of the residuals obtained\nby our reconstruction may become more than an order of magnitude lower than\nthat of the original measurements.
