    "abstract": "Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) is expected to become a key enabling\ntechnology for 6G wireless communication networks as they can significantly\nimprove the wireless network's performance, creating a controllable radio\nenvironment in preferred directions. The vision for Industry 5.0 is for close\ncooperation between humans and machines, requiring ultra-reliability and low\nlatency communications (URLLC). IRS is expected to play a crucial role in\nrealizing wireless URLLC for Industry 5.0. In this paper, we first provide an\noverview of IRS technology and then conceptualize the potential for IRS\nimplementation in a smart manufacturing environment to support the emergence of\nIndustry 5.0 with a series of applications. Finally, to stimulate future\nresearch in this area, we discuss the strength, open challenges, maturity, and\nenhancing areas of the IRS technology in modern smart manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Code smells indicate software design problems that harm software quality.\nData-intensive systems that frequently access databases often suffer from SQL\ncode smells besides the traditional smells. While there have been extensive\nstudies on traditional code smells, recently, there has been a growing interest\nin SQL code smells. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to investigate\nthe prevalence and evolution of SQL code smells in open-source, data-intensive\nsystems. We collected 150 projects and examined both traditional and SQL code\nsmells in these projects. Our investigation delivers several important\nfindings. First, SQL code smells are indeed prevalent in data-intensive\nsoftware systems. Second, SQL code smells have a weak co-occurrence with\ntraditional code smells. Third, SQL code smells have a weaker association with\nbugs than that of traditional code smells. Fourth, SQL code smells are more\nlikely to be introduced at the beginning of the project lifetime and likely to\nbe left in the code without a fix, compared to traditional code smells.\nOverall, our results show that SQL code smells are indeed prevalent and\npersistent in the studied data-intensive software systems. Developers should be\naware of these smells and consider detecting and refactoring SQL code smells\nand traditional code smells separately, using dedicated tools.",

    "abstract": "Neural operators have recently become popular tools for designing solution\nmaps between function spaces in the form of neural networks. Differently from\nclassical scientific machine learning approaches that learn parameters of a\nknown partial differential equation (PDE) for a single instance of the input\nparameters at a fixed resolution, neural operators approximate the solution map\nof a family of PDEs. Despite their success, the uses of neural operators are so\nfar restricted to relatively shallow neural networks and confined to learning\nhidden governing laws. In this work, we propose a novel nonlocal neural\noperator, which we refer to as nonlocal kernel network (NKN), that is\nresolution independent, characterized by deep neural networks, and capable of\nhandling a variety of tasks such as learning governing equations and\nclassifying images. Our NKN stems from the interpretation of the neural network\nas a discrete nonlocal diffusion reaction equation that, in the limit of\ninfinite layers, is equivalent to a parabolic nonlocal equation, whose\nstability is analyzed via nonlocal vector calculus. The resemblance with\nintegral forms of neural operators allows NKNs to capture long-range\ndependencies in the feature space, while the continuous treatment of\nnode-to-node interactions makes NKNs resolution independent. The resemblance\nwith neural ODEs, reinterpreted in a nonlocal sense, and the stable network\ndynamics between layers allow for generalization of NKN's optimal parameters\nfrom shallow to deep networks. This fact enables the use of shallow-to-deep\ninitialization techniques. Our tests show that NKNs outperform baseline methods\nin both learning governing equations and image classification tasks and\ngeneralize well to different resolutions and depths.",

However, only 4% of PPIs are\nannotated with PTMs in biological knowledge databases such as IntAct, mainly\nperformed through manual curation, which is neither time nor cost-effective. We\nuse the IntAct PPI database to create a distant supervised dataset annotated\nwith interacting protein pairs, their corresponding PTM type, and associated\nabstracts from the PubMed database. We train an ensemble of BioBERT models -\ndubbed PPI-BioBERT-x10 to improve confidence calibration.

The\nPPI-BioBERT-x10 model evaluated on the test set resulted in a modest F1-micro\n41.3 (P =5 8.1, R = 32.1). However, by combining high confidence and low\nvariation to identify high quality predictions, tuning the predictions for\nprecision, we retained 19% of the test predictions with 100% precision.

Of the 5700, human evaluation on a\nsmall randomly sampled subset shows that the precision drops to 33.7% despite\nconfidence calibration and highlights the challenges of generalisability beyond\nthe test set even with confidence calibration. We circumvent the problem by\nonly including predictions associated with multiple papers, improving the\nprecision to 58.8%.

    "abstract": "Recently, attentional arbitrary style transfer methods have been proposed to\nachieve fine-grained results, which manipulates the point-wise similarity\nbetween content and style features for stylization. However, the attention\nmechanism based on feature points ignores the feature multi-manifold\ndistribution, where each feature manifold corresponds to a semantic region in\nthe image. Consequently, a uniform content semantic region is rendered by\nhighly different patterns from various style semantic regions, producing\ninconsistent stylization results with visual artifacts. We proposed the\nprogressive attentional manifold alignment (PAMA) to alleviate this problem,\nwhich repeatedly applies attention operations and space-aware interpolations.\nThe attention operation rearranges style features dynamically according to the\nspatial distribution of content features. This makes the content and style\nmanifolds correspond on the feature map. Then the space-aware interpolation\nadaptively interpolates between the corresponding content and style manifolds\nto increase their similarity. By gradually aligning the content manifolds to\nstyle manifolds, the proposed PAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance while\navoiding the inconsistency of semantic regions.

This work investigates two independent systems with overlapping\nelectrical measurements with the goal to more rapidly identify anomalies.

While prior research has explored the benefits of\nfusing measurements, the possibility of overlapping measurements from an\nexisting electrical system has not been investigated. To that end, we explore\nthe potential benefits of combining overlapping measurements both to improve\nthe speed/accuracy of anomaly detection and to provide additional validation of\nthe collected measurements. In this paper, we show that merging overlapping\nmeasurements provide a more holistic picture of the observed systems. By\napplying Dynamic Time Warping more anomalies were found -- specifically, an\naverage of 349 times more anomalies, when considering anomalies from both\noverlapping measurements. When merging the overlapping measurements, a percent\nchange of anomalies of up to 785\\% can be achieved compared to a non-merge of\nthe data as reflected by experimental results.",

    "abstract": "The Moran process is a classic stochastic process that models invasion\ndynamics on graphs. A single \"mutant\" (e.g., a new opinion, strain, social\ntrait etc.) invades a population of residents spread over the nodes of a graph.\nThe mutant fitness advantage $\\delta\\geq 0$ determines how aggressively mutants\npropagate to their neighbors. The quantity of interest is the fixation\nprobability, i.e., the probability that the initial mutant eventually takes\nover the whole population. However, in realistic settings, the invading mutant\nhas an advantage only in certain locations. E.g., a bacterial mutation allowing\nfor lactose metabolism only confers an advantage on places where dairy products\nare present. In this paper we introduce the positional Moran process, a natural\ngeneralization in which the mutant fitness advantage is only realized on\nspecific nodes called active nodes. The associated optimization problem is\nfixation maximization: given a budget $k$, choose a set of $k$ active nodes\nthat maximize the fixation probability of the invading mutant. We show that the\nproblem is NP-hard, while the optimization function is not submodular, thus\nindicating strong computational hardness. Then we focus on two natural limits.\nIn the limit of $\\delta\\to\\infty$ (strong selection), although the problem\nremains NP-hard, the optimization function becomes submodular and thus admits a\nconstant-factor approximation using a simple greedy algorithm. In the limit of\n$\\delta\\to 0$ (weak selection), we show that in $O(m^\\omega)$ time we can\nobtain a tight approximation, where $m$ is the number of edges and $\\omega$ is\nthe matrix-multiplication exponent.

It proposes a learning\nframework for identifying promising controls during the expansion process of\nsampling-based motion planners for systems with dynamics. Offline, the learning\nprocess is trained to return the highest-quality control that reaches a local\ngoal state (i.e., a waypoint) in the absence of obstacles from an input\ndifference vector between its current state and a local goal state. The data\ngeneration scheme provides bounds on the target dispersion and uses state space\npruning to ensure high-quality controls. By focusing on the system's dynamics,\nthis process is data efficient and takes place once for a dynamical system, so\nthat it can be used for different environments with modular expansion\nfunctions. This work integrates the proposed learning process with a) an\nexploratory expansion function that generates waypoints with biased coverage\nover the reachable space, and b) proposes an exploitative expansion function\nfor mobile robots, which generates waypoints using medial axis information.\nThis paper evaluates the learning process and the corresponding planners for a\nfirst and second-order differential drive systems. The results show that the\nproposed integration of learning and planning can produce better quality paths\nthan kinodynamic planning with random controls in fewer iterations and\ncomputation time.",

    "abstract": "The field of artificial intelligence has significantly advanced over the past\ndecades, inspired by discoveries from the fields of biology and neuroscience.\nThe idea of this work is inspired by the process of self-organization of\ncortical areas in the human brain from both afferent and lateral/internal\nconnections. In this work, we develop an original brain-inspired neural model\nassociating Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Hebbian learning in the Reentrant\nSOM (ReSOM) model. The framework is applied to multimodal classification\nproblems. Compared to existing methods based on unsupervised learning with\npost-labeling, the model enhances the state-of-the-art results. This work also\ndemonstrates the distributed and scalable nature of the model through both\nsimulation results and hardware execution on a dedicated FPGA-based platform\nnamed SCALP (Self-configurable 3D Cellular Adaptive Platform). SCALP boards can\nbe interconnected in a modular way to support the structure of the neural\nmodel. Such a unified software and hardware approach enables the processing to\nbe scaled and allows information from several modalities to be merged\ndynamically. The deployment on hardware boards provides performance results of\nparallel execution on several devices, with the communication between each\nboard through dedicated serial links. The proposed unified architecture,\ncomposed of the ReSOM model and the SCALP hardware platform, demonstrates a\nsignificant increase in accuracy thanks to multimodal association, and a good\ntrade-off between latency and power consumption compared to a centralized GPU\nimplementation.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art stereo matching networks trained only on synthetic data\noften fail to generalize to more challenging real data domains. In this paper,\nwe attempt to unfold an important factor that hinders the networks from\ngeneralizing across domains: through the lens of shortcut learning. We\ndemonstrate that the learning of feature representations in stereo matching\nnetworks is heavily influenced by synthetic data artefacts (shortcut\nattributes). To mitigate this issue, we propose an Information-Theoretic\nShortcut Avoidance~(ITSA) approach to automatically restrict shortcut-related\ninformation from being encoded into the feature representations. As a result,\nour proposed method learns robust and shortcut-invariant features by minimizing\nthe sensitivity of latent features to input variations. To avoid the\nprohibitive computational cost of direct input sensitivity optimization, we\npropose an effective yet feasible algorithm to achieve robustness. We show that\nusing this method, state-of-the-art stereo matching networks that are trained\npurely on synthetic data can effectively generalize to challenging and\npreviously unseen real data scenarios. Importantly, the proposed method\nenhances the robustness of the synthetic trained networks to the point that\nthey outperform their fine-tuned counterparts (on real data) for challenging\nout-of-domain stereo datasets.",

Two main characteristics make the\ncharge-end time span a good opportunity to correct SOC estimation: first, it is\neasy to detect when the battery is at the last stage of charging because the\ncharging profile is known to the BMS designer and also during the charge-end\ntime span the amount of current is low, and the terminal voltage of the battery\ncells are high; second, as the battery reaches the charge-end stage, we know\nthat the true SOC is approaching to 100%. This paper presents a method to\nutilize these important features to correct the SOC estimation error. Using a\nvoltage threshold method, the algorithm detects when the battery is close to\nthe charge-end to activate the charge-end SOC correction strategy. Once\nactivated, the strategy corrects the SOC using the maximum cell voltage to\nguarantee that SOC is 100% when charging is complete.

    "abstract": "Effective human learning depends on a wide selection of educational materials\nthat align with the learner's current understanding of the topic. While the\nInternet has revolutionized human learning or education, a substantial resource\naccessibility barrier still exists. Namely, the excess of online information\ncan make it challenging to navigate and discover high-quality learning\nmaterials. In this paper, we propose the educational resource discovery (ERD)\npipeline that automates web resource discovery for novel domains. The pipeline\nconsists of three main steps: data collection, feature extraction, and resource\nclassification. We start with a known source domain and conduct resource\ndiscovery on two unseen target domains via transfer learning. We first collect\nfrequent queries from a set of seed documents and search on the web to obtain\ncandidate resources, such as lecture slides and introductory blog posts. Then\nwe introduce a novel pretrained information retrieval deep neural network\nmodel, query-document masked language modeling (QD-MLM), to extract deep\nfeatures of these candidate resources. We apply a tree-based classifier to\ndecide whether the candidate is a positive learning resource. The pipeline\nachieves F1 scores of 0.94 and 0.82 when evaluated on two similar but novel\ntarget domains. Finally, we demonstrate how this pipeline can benefit an\napplication: leading paragraph generation for surveys. This is the first study\nthat considers various web resources for survey generation, to the best of our\nknowledge. We also release a corpus of 39,728 manually labeled web resources\nand 659 queries from NLP, Computer Vision (CV), and Statistics (STATS).",

    "abstract": "We study distributed algorithms for finding a Nash equilibrium (NE) in a\nclass of non-cooperative convex games under partial information. Specifically,\neach agent has access only to its own smooth local cost function and can\nreceive information from its neighbors in a time-varying directed communication\nnetwork. To this end, we propose a distributed gradient play algorithm to\ncompute a NE by utilizing local information exchange among the players. In this\nalgorithm, every agent performs a gradient step to minimize its own cost\nfunction while sharing and retrieving information locally among its neighbors.\nThe existing methods impose strong assumptions such as balancedness of the\nmixing matrices and global knowledge of the network communication structure,\nincluding Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of the adjacency matrix and other graph\nconnectivity constants.

    "title": "On the Effectiveness of Sampled Softmax Loss for Item Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Learning objectives of recommender models remain largely unexplored. Most\nmethods routinely adopt either pointwise or pairwise loss to train the model\nparameters, while rarely pay attention to softmax loss due to the high\ncomputational cost. Sampled softmax loss emerges as an efficient substitute for\nsoftmax loss. Its special case, InfoNCE loss, has been widely used in\nself-supervised learning and exhibited remarkable performance for contrastive\nlearning. Nonetheless, limited studies use sampled softmax loss as the learning\nobjective to train the recommender. Worse still, none of them explore its\nproperties and answer \"Does sampled softmax loss suit for item recommendation?\"\nand \"What are the conceptual advantages of sampled softmax loss, as compared\nwith the prevalent losses?\", to the best of our knowledge. In this work, we aim\nto better understand sampled softmax loss for item recommendation.\nSpecifically, we first theoretically reveal three model-agnostic advantages:\n(1) mitigating popularity bias, which is beneficial to long-tail\nrecommendation; (2) mining hard negative samples, which offers informative\ngradients to optimize model parameters; and (3) maximizing the ranking metric,\nwhich facilitates top-K performance. Moreover, we probe the model-specific\ncharacteristics on the top of various recommenders. Experimental results\nsuggest that sampled softmax loss is more friendly to history and graph-based\nrecommenders (e.g., SVD++ and LightGCN), but performs poorly for ID-based\nmodels (e.g., MF). We ascribe this to its shortcoming in learning\nrepresentation magnitude, making the combination with the models that are also\nincapable of adjusting representation magnitude learn poor representations. In\ncontrast, the history- and graph-based models, which naturally adjust\nrepresentation magnitude according to node degree, are able to compensate for\nthe shortcoming of sampled softmax loss.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the question whether model knowledge can prevent a\ndefender from being deceived or not in cyber security. As a specific\nmodel-based defense scheme, this study treats Bayesian defense mechanism, which\nmonitors the system's behavior, forms a belief on existence of the attacker,\nand chooses appropriate reactions. Sophisticated attackers aim at achieving her\nobjective while avoiding being detected by deceiving the defender. In this\npaper, their dynamic decision making is formulated as a stochastic signaling\ngame. It is revealed that the belief on the true scenario has a limit in a\nstochastic sense at an equilibrium based on martingale analysis. This fact\nimplies that there are only two possible cases: the defender asymptotically\ndetects the attack with a firm belief or the attacker takes actions such that\nthe system's behavior becomes nominal after a certain finite time step.\nConsequently, if the dynamics admits no stealthy attacks, the system is\nguaranteed to be secure in an asymptotic manner provided that effective\ncountermeasures are implemented. The result concludes that model knowledge can\nprevent deception in an asymptotic sense. As an application of the finding, a\ndefensive deception utilizing asymmetric recognition on vulnerabilities\nexploited by the attacker is analyzed. It is shown that, the attacker possibly\nstops the attack even if the defender is unaware of the vulnerabilities as long\nas the defender's unawareness is concealed by the defensive deception. Those\nresults indicate the powerful defense capability achieved by model knowledge.",

Among them, the\ndecentralized finance (DeFi) is one of the most successful applications, which\nis regarded as the future of finance. The great success of DeFi relies on the\nreal-world data which is not directly available on the blockchain. Besides, due\nto the deterministic nature of blockchain,the blockchain cannot directly obtain\nin-deterministic data from the outside world (off-chain). Thus, oracles have\nappeared as a viable solution to feed off-chain data to blockchain\napplications. In this paper, we carryout a comprehensive study on oracles,\nespecially on DeFi oracles. We first briefly introduce the application\nscenarios of DeFi oracles, and then we talk about the past of DeFi oracles by\ncategorizing them into several types based on their design features. After\nthat, we introduce five popular DeFi oracles currently in use(such as Chainlink\nand Band Protocol), with the focus on their system architecture, data\nvalidation process,and their incentive mechanisms. We compare these present\nDeFi oracles from their data trustworthiness,data source trustworthiness and\ntheir overall trust models. Finally, we propose a set of metrics for designing\ntrustworthiness DeFi oracles, and propose a potential trust architecture and a\nfew promising techniques for building trustworthiness oracles.",

    "abstract": "Motion prediction is a classic problem in computer vision, which aims at\nforecasting future motion given the observed pose sequence. Various deep\nlearning models have been proposed, achieving state-of-the-art performance on\nmotion prediction. However, existing methods typically focus on modeling\ntemporal dynamics in the pose space. Unfortunately, the complicated and high\ndimensionality nature of human motion brings inherent challenges for dynamic\ncontext capturing. Therefore, we move away from the conventional pose based\nrepresentation and present a novel approach employing a phase space trajectory\nrepresentation of individual joints. Moreover, current methods tend to only\nconsider the dependencies between physically connected joints. In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel convolutional neural model to effectively leverage\nexplicit prior knowledge of motion anatomy, and simultaneously capture both\nspatial and temporal information of joint trajectory dynamics. We then propose\na global optimization module that learns the implicit relationships between\nindividual joint features.\nEmpirically, our method is evaluated on large-scale 3D human motion benchmark\ndatasets (i.e., Human3.6M, CMU MoCap).

    "abstract": "Deraining is a significant and fundamental computer vision task, aiming to\nremove the rain streaks and accumulations in an image or video captured under a\nrainy day. Existing deraining methods usually make heuristic assumptions of the\nrain model, which compels them to employ complex optimization or iterative\nrefinement for high recovery quality. This, however, leads to time-consuming\nmethods and affects the effectiveness for addressing rain patterns deviated\nfrom from the assumptions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient\nderaining method by formulating deraining as a predictive filtering problem\nwithout complex rain model assumptions. Specifically, we identify\nspatially-variant predictive filtering (SPFilt) that adaptively predicts proper\nkernels via a deep network to filter different individual pixels. Since the\nfiltering can be implemented via well-accelerated convolution, our method can\nbe significantly efficient. We further propose the EfDeRain+ that contains\nthree main contributions to address residual rain traces, multi-scale, and\ndiverse rain patterns without harming the efficiency. First, we propose the\nuncertainty-aware cascaded predictive filtering (UC-PFilt) that can identify\nthe difficulties of reconstructing clean pixels via predicted kernels and\nremove the residual rain traces effectively. Second, we design the\nweight-sharing multi-scale dilated filtering (WS-MS-DFilt) to handle\nmulti-scale rain streaks without harming the efficiency. Third, to eliminate\nthe gap across diverse rain patterns, we propose a novel data augmentation\nmethod (i.e., RainMix) to train our deep models. By combining all contributions\nwith sophisticated analysis on different variants, our final method outperforms\nbaseline methods on four single-image deraining datasets and one video\nderaining dataset in terms of both recovery quality and speed.",

Additionally, we use the partial polynomial\nmultiplier itself as a kind of countermeasure against DPA attacks. We\ndemonstrate that the implemented classical multiplication formula can increase\nthe inherent resistance of the whole ECC design. We also investigate the impact\nof the combination of these two approaches. For the evaluation we synthesized\nall these designs for a 250 nm gate library technologies, and analysed the\nsimulated power traces. All investigated protection means help to decrease the\nsuccess rate of attacks significantly: the correctness of the revealed key was\ndecreased from 99% to 69%.",

    "abstract": "We propose unwinding the rotations experienced by the user of an immersive\ntelepresence robot to improve comfort and reduce VR sickness of the user. By\nimmersive telepresence we refer to a situation where a 360\\textdegree~camera on\ntop of a mobile robot is streaming video and audio into a head-mounted display\nworn by a remote user possibly far away. Thus, it enables the user to be\npresent at the robot's location, look around by turning the head and\ncommunicate with people near the robot. By unwinding the rotations of the\ncamera frame, the user's viewpoint is not changed when the robot rotates. The\nuser can change her viewpoint only by physically rotating in her local setting;\nas visual rotation without the corresponding vestibular stimulation is a major\nsource of VR sickness, physical rotation by the user is expected to reduce VR\nsickness. We implemented unwinding the rotations for a simulated robot\ntraversing a virtual environment and ran a user study (N=34) comparing\nunwinding rotations to user's viewpoint turning when the robot turns. Our\nresults show that the users found unwound rotations more preferable and\ncomfortable and that it reduced their level of VR sickness. We also present\nfurther results about the users' path integration capabilities, viewing\ndirections, and subjective observations of the robot's speed and distances to\nsimulated people and objects.",

    "abstract": "Detecting human interactions is crucial for human behavior analysis. Many\nmethods have been proposed to deal with Human-to-Object Interaction (HOI)\ndetection, i.e., detecting in an image which person and object interact\ntogether and classifying the type of interaction. However, Human-to-Human\nInteractions, such as social and violent interactions, are generally not\nconsidered in available HOI training datasets. As we think these types of\ninteractions cannot be ignored and decorrelated from HOI when analyzing human\nbehavior, we propose a new interaction dataset to deal with both types of human\ninteractions: Human-to-Human-or-Object (H2O). In addition, we introduce a novel\ntaxonomy of verbs, intended to be closer to a description of human body\nattitude in relation to the surrounding targets of interaction, and more\nindependent of the environment. Unlike some existing datasets, we strive to\navoid defining synonymous verbs when their use highly depends on the target\ntype or requires a high level of semantic interpretation. As H2O dataset\nincludes V-COCO images annotated with this new taxonomy, images obviously\ncontain more interactions. This can be an issue for HOI detection methods whose\ncomplexity depends on the number of people, targets or interactions. Thus, we\npropose DIABOLO (Detecting InterActions By Only Looking Once), an efficient\nsubject-centric single-shot method to detect all interactions in one forward\npass, with constant inference time independent of image content. In addition,\nthis multi-task network simultaneously detects all people and objects. We show\nhow sharing a network for these tasks does not only save computation resource\nbut also improves performance collaboratively. Finally, DIABOLO is a strong\nbaseline for the new proposed challenge of H2O Interaction detection, as it\noutperforms all state-of-the-art methods when trained and evaluated on HOI\ndataset V-COCO.",

    "abstract": "We consider the task of lexicographic direct access to query answers. That\nis, we want to simulate an array containing the answers of a join query sorted\nin a lexicographic order chosen by the user. A recent dichotomy showed for\nwhich queries and orders this task can be done in polylogarithmic access time\nafter quasilinear preprocessing, but this dichotomy does not tell us how much\ntime is required in the cases classified as hard. We determine the\npreprocessing time needed to achieve polylogarithmic access time for all\nself-join free queries and all lexicographical orders. To this end, we propose\na decomposition-based general algorithm for direct access on join queries. We\nthen explore its optimality by proving lower bounds for the preprocessing time\nbased on the hardness of a certain online Set-Disjointness problem, which shows\nthat our algorithm's bounds are tight for all lexicographic orders on self-join\nfree queries. Then, we prove the hardness of Set-Disjointness based on the\nZero-Clique Conjecture which is an established conjecture from fine-grained\ncomplexity theory. We also show that similar techniques can be used to prove\nthat, for enumerating answers to Loomis-Whitney joins, it is not possible to\nsignificantly improve upon trivially computing all answers at preprocessing.\nThis, in turn, gives further evidence (based on the Zero-Clique Conjecture) to\nthe enumeration hardness of self-join free cyclic joins with respect to linear\npreprocessing and constant delay.",

Therefore, we design an auction-based incentive mechanism\nfor horizontal federated learning with reputation and contribution measurement.\nBy designing a reasonable method of measuring contribution, we establish the\nreputation of workers, which is easy to decline and difficult to improve.\nThrough reverse auctions, workers bid for tasks, and the task publisher selects\nworkers combining reputation and bid price.

To inform the\ndesign of technological solutions within dementia care, we followed a\nuser-centered design approach through worldwide surveys, follow-up\nsemi-structured interviews, and focus groups. Seven hundred and seven informal\nand 52 formal caregivers participated in our study. Our findings show that\ntechnological solutions must provide mechanisms to carry out the therapy in a\nsimple way, reducing the amount of work for caregivers when preparing and\nconducting therapy sessions. They should also diversify and personalize the\ncurrent session (and following ones) based on both the biographical information\nof the PwD and their emotional reactions. This is particularly important since\nthe PwD often become agitated, aggressive or angry, and caregivers might not\nknow how to properly deal with this situation (in particular, the informal\nones). Additionally, formal caregivers need an easy way to manage information\nof the different PwD they take care of, and consult the history of sessions\nperformed (in particular, to identify images that triggered negative emotional\nreactions, and consult any notes taken about them). As a result, we present a\nlist of validated functional requirements gathered for the PwD and both formal\nand informal caregivers, as well as the corresponding expected primary and\nsecondary outcomes.",

Locating\nepistatic interactions is a computationally expensive challenge that involves\nanalyzing an exponentially growing number of combinations. Authors in this\nfield have resorted to a multitude of hardware architectures in order to speed\nup the search, but little to no attention has been paid to the vector\ninstructions that current CPUs include in their instruction sets. This work\nextends an existing third-order exhaustive algorithm to support the search of\nepistasis interactions of any order and discusses multiple SIMD implementations\nof the different functions that compose the search using Intel AVX Intrinsics.\nResults using the GCC and the Intel compiler show that the 512-bit explicit\nvector implementation proposed here performs the best out of all of the other\nimplementations evaluated. The proposed 512-bit vectorization accelerates the\noriginal implementation of the algorithm by an average factor of 7 and 12, for\nGCC and the Intel Compiler, respectively, in the scenarios tested.",

    "abstract": "In business retention, churn prevention has always been a major concern. This\nwork contributes to this domain by formalizing the problem of churn prediction\nin the context of online gambling as a binary classification task. We also\npropose an algorithmic answer to this problem based on recurrent neural\nnetwork. This algorithm is tested with online gambling data that have the form\nof time series, which can be efficiently processed by recurrent neural\nnetworks. To evaluate the performances of the trained models, standard machine\nlearning metrics were used, such as accuracy, precision and recall. For this\nproblem in particular, the conducted experiments allowed to assess that the\nchoice of a specific architecture depends on the metric which is given the\ngreatest importance. Architectures using nBRC favour precision, those using\nLSTM give better recall, while GRU-based architectures allow a higher accuracy\nand balance two other metrics. Moreover, further experiments showed that using\nonly the more recent time-series histories to train the networks decreases the\nquality of the results. We also study the performances of models learned at a\nspecific instant $t$, at other times $t^{\\prime} > t$. The results show that\nthe performances of the models learned at time $t$ remain good at the following\ninstants $t^{\\prime} > t$, suggesting that there is no need to refresh the\nmodels at a high rate. However, the performances of the models were subject to\nnoticeable variance due to one-off events impacting the data.",

    "abstract": "This paper tackles two problems that are relevant to coding for insertions\nand deletions. These problems are motivated by several applications, among them\nis reconstructing strands in DNA-based storage systems. Under this paradigm, a\nword is transmitted over some fixed number of identical independent channels\nand the goal of the decoder is to output the transmitted word or some close\napproximation of it. The first part of this paper studies the deletion channel\nthat deletes a symbol with some fixed probability $p$, while focusing on two\ninstances of this channel. Since operating the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder\nin this case is computationally unfeasible, we study a slightly degraded\nversion of this decoder for two channels and its expected normalized distance.\nWe identify the dominant error patterns and based on these observations, it is\nderived that the expected normalized distance of the degraded ML decoder is\nroughly $\\frac{3q-1}{q-1}p^2$, when the transmitted word is any $q$-ary\nsequence and $p$ is the channel's deletion probability. We also study the cases\nwhen the transmitted word belongs to the Varshamov Tenengolts (VT) code or the\nshifted VT code. Additionally, the insertion channel is studied as well as the\ncase of two insertion channels. These theoretical results are verified by\ncorresponding simulations. The second part of the paper studies optimal\ndecoding for a special case of the deletion channel, the $k$-deletion channel,\nwhich deletes exactly $k$ symbols of the transmitted word uniformly at random.\nIn this part, the goal is to understand how an optimal decoder operates in\norder to minimize the expected normalized distance. A full characterization of\nan efficient optimal decoder for this setup, referred to as the maximum\nlikelihood* (ML*) decoder, is given for a channel that deletes one or two\nsymbols.",

Mobile\nphones represent a unique opportunity to monitor international mobility flows\nin a timely manner and with proper spatial aggregation.

Some problems for deep learning approaches to sound synthesis relate\nto the amount of data needed to specify an audio signal and the necessity of\npreserving both the long and short time coherence of the synthesised signal.\nVisual time-frequency representations such as the log-mel-spectrogram have\ngained in popularity. The log-mel-spectrogram is a perceptually informed\nrepresentation of audio that greatly compresses the amount of information\nrequired for the description of the sound. However, because of this\ncompression, this representation is not directly invertible.

Deep\nlearning models have achieved expressive voice synthesis, realistic sound\ntextures, and musical notes from virtual instruments.

A sound's\noriginal waveform can be too dense and rich for deep learning models to deal\nwith efficiently - and complexity increases training time and computational\ncost. Also, it does not represent sound in the manner in which it is perceived.\nTherefore, in many cases, the raw audio has been transformed into a compressed\nand more meaningful form using upsampling, feature-extraction, or even by\nadopting a higher level illustration of the waveform. Furthermore, conditional\non the form chosen, additional conditioning representations, different model\narchitectures, and numerous metrics for evaluating the reconstructed sound have\nbeen investigated.

Given a\nsequence $a_1,\\ldots,a_n$ of letters from an alphabet $\\{0,\\ldots,\\sigma-1\\}$\nsuch that each letter $a$ occurs in it $f_a$ times and $n=2^r$, the tANS\nencoder using Duda's ``precise initialization'' to fill tANS tables transforms\nthis sequence into a bit string of length (frequencies are not included in the\nencoding size): $$ \\sum\\limits_{a\\in\n[0..\\sigma)}f_a\\cdot\\log\\frac{n}{f_a}+O(\\sigma+r), $$ where $O(\\sigma + r)$ can\nbe bounded by $\\sigma\\log e+r$. The $r$-bit term is an encoder artifact\nindispensable to ANS; the rest incurs a redundancy of $O(\\frac{\\sigma}{n})$\nbits per letter. We complement this bound by a series of examples showing that\nan $\\Omega(\\sigma+r)$ redundancy is necessary when $\\sigma > n/3$, where\n$\\Omega(\\sigma + r)$ is at least $\\frac{\\sigma-1}{4}+r-2$. We argue that\nsimilar examples exist for any methods that distribute letters in tANS tables\nusing only the knowledge about frequencies. Thus, we refute Duda's conjecture\nthat the redundancy is $O(\\frac{\\sigma}{n^2})$ bits per letter.\nWe also propose a new variant of range ANS (rANS), called rANS with fixed\naccuracy, that is parameterized by $k \\ge 1$. In this variant the integer\ndivision, which is unavoidable in rANS, is performed only in cases when its\nresult belongs to $[2^k..2^{k+1})$. Hence, the division can be computed by\nfaster methods provided $k$ is small. We bound the redundancy for the rANS with\nfixed accuracy $k$ by $\\frac{n}{2^k-1}\\log e+r$.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel backbone architecture to improve target-perception\nability of feature representation for tracking. Specifically, having observed\nthat de facto frameworks perform feature matching simply using the outputs from\nbackbone for target localization, there is no direct feedback from the matching\nmodule to the backbone network, especially the shallow layers. More concretely,\nonly the matching module can directly access the target information (in the\nreference frame), while the representation learning of candidate frame is blind\nto the reference target. As a consequence, the accumulation effect of\ntarget-irrelevant interference in the shallow stages may degrade the feature\nquality of deeper layers. In this paper, we approach the problem from a\ndifferent angle by conducting multiple branch-wise interactions inside the\nSiamese-like backbone networks (InBN). At the core of InBN is a general\ninteraction modeler (GIM) that injects the prior knowledge of reference image\nto different stages of the backbone network, leading to better\ntarget-perception and robust distractor-resistance of candidate feature\nrepresentation with negligible computation cost. The proposed GIM module and\nInBN mechanism are general and applicable to different backbone types including\nCNN and Transformer for improvements, as evidenced by our extensive experiments\non multiple benchmarks. In particular, the CNN version (based on SiamCAR)\nimproves the baseline with 3.2/6.9 absolute gains of SUC on LaSOT/TNL2K,\nrespectively. The Transformer version obtains SUC scores of 65.7/52.0 on\nLaSOT/TNL2K, which are on par with recent state of the arts. Code and models\nwill be released.",

Previous work introduced \\textit{risk-based active learning}, an\nonline approach for the development of statistical classifiers that takes into\naccount the decision-support context in which they are applied. Decision-making\nis considered by preferentially querying data labels according to\n\\textit{expected value of perfect information} (EVPI). Although several\nbenefits are gained by adopting a risk-based active learning approach,\nincluding improved decision-making performance, the algorithms suffer from\nissues relating to sampling bias as a result of the guided querying process.\nThis sampling bias ultimately manifests as a decline in decision-making\nperformance during the later stages of active learning, which in turn\ncorresponds to lost resource/utility.\nThe current paper proposes two novel approaches to counteract the effects of\nsampling bias: \\textit{semi-supervised learning}, and \\textit{discriminative\nclassification models}. These approaches are first visualised using a synthetic\ndataset, then subsequently applied to an experimental case study, specifically,\nthe Z24 Bridge dataset. The semi-supervised learning approach is shown to have\nvariable performance; with robustness to sampling bias dependent on the\nsuitability of the generative distributions selected for the model with respect\nto each dataset. In contrast, the discriminative classifiers are shown to have\nexcellent robustness to the effects of sampling bias. Moreover, it was found\nthat the number of inspections made during a monitoring campaign, and therefore\nresource expenditure, could be reduced with the careful selection of the\nstatistical classifiers used within a decision-supporting monitoring system.",

In particular, when designing chemical\nreactors such as fluidized bed reactors (FBR), a detailed understanding of the\nhydrodynamics is critical for optimizing reactor performance and stability. An\nFBR allows experts to conduct different types of chemical reactions involving\nmultiphase materials, especially interaction between gas and solids.

Study of these bubbles\nhas a deep implication in predicting the reactor's overall efficiency. But\nphysical experiments needed to understand bubble dynamics are costly and\nnon-trivial.

To address these issues\nand allow the application scientists to explore the bubble dynamics in an\nefficient and timely manner, we have developed an end-to-end visual analytics\npipeline that enables in situ detection of bubbles using statistical\ntechniques, followed by a flexible and interactive visual exploration of bubble\ndynamics in the post hoc analysis phase.

Furthermore,\nvisual attention-prediction and feature-track based models showed better\ngeneralization performance than image-based models when evaluated on hold-out\nreference trajectories.

    "abstract": "Elephant-human conflict (EHC) is one of the major problems in most African\nand Asian countries. As humans overutilize natural resources for their\ndevelopment, elephants' living area continues to decrease; this leads elephants\nto invade the human living area and raid crops more frequently, costing\nmillions of dollars annually. To mitigate EHC, in this paper, we propose an\noriginal solution that comprises of three parts: a compact custom low-power GPS\ntag that is installed on the elephants, a receiver stationed in the human\nliving area that detects the elephants' presence near a farm, and an autonomous\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system that tracks and herds the elephants away\nfrom the farms. By utilizing proportional-integral-derivative controller and\nmachine learning algorithms, we obtain accurate tracking trajectories at a\nreal-time processing speed of 32 FPS. Our proposed autonomous system can save\nover 68 % cost compared with human-controlled UAVs in mitigating EHC.",

    "title": "Leveraging Scale-Invariance and Uncertainity with Self-Supervised Domain  Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation of Foggy Scenes",
    "abstract": "This paper presents FogAdapt, a novel approach for domain adaptation of\nsemantic segmentation for dense foggy scenes. Although significant research has\nbeen directed to reduce the domain shift in semantic segmentation, adaptation\nto scenes with adverse weather conditions remains an open question. Large\nvariations in the visibility of the scene due to weather conditions, such as\nfog, smog, and haze, exacerbate the domain shift, thus making unsupervised\nadaptation in such scenarios challenging. We propose a self-entropy and\nmulti-scale information augmented self-supervised domain adaptation method\n(FogAdapt) to minimize the domain shift in foggy scenes segmentation. Supported\nby the empirical evidence that an increase in fog density results in high\nself-entropy for segmentation probabilities, we introduce a self-entropy based\nloss function to guide the adaptation method. Furthermore, inferences obtained\nat different image scales are combined and weighted by the uncertainty to\ngenerate scale-invariant pseudo-labels for the target domain. These\nscale-invariant pseudo-labels are robust to visibility and scale variations. We\nevaluate the proposed model on real clear-weather scenes to real foggy scenes\nadaptation and synthetic non-foggy images to real foggy scenes adaptation\nscenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that FogAdapt significantly outperforms\nthe current state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation of foggy images.\nSpecifically, by considering the standard settings compared to state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods, FogAdapt gains 3.8% on Foggy Zurich, 6.0% on Foggy\nDriving-dense, and 3.6% on Foggy Driving in mIoU when adapted from Cityscapes\nto Foggy Zurich.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent success of long-tailed object detection, almost all\nlong-tailed object detectors are developed based on the two-stage paradigm. In\npractice, one-stage detectors are more prevalent in the industry because they\nhave a simple and fast pipeline that is easy to deploy. However, in the\nlong-tailed scenario, this line of work has not been explored so far. In this\npaper, we investigate whether one-stage detectors can perform well in this\ncase. We discover the primary obstacle that prevents one-stage detectors from\nachieving excellent performance is: categories suffer from different degrees of\npositive-negative imbalance problems under the long-tailed data distribution.\nThe conventional focal loss balances the training process with the same\nmodulating factor for all categories, thus failing to handle the long-tailed\nproblem. To address this issue, we propose the Equalized Focal Loss (EFL) that\nrebalances the loss contribution of positive and negative samples of different\ncategories independently according to their imbalance degrees. Specifically,\nEFL adopts a category-relevant modulating factor which can be adjusted\ndynamically by the training status of different categories. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on the challenging LVIS v1 benchmark demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method. With an end-to-end training pipeline, EFL\nachieves 29.2% in terms of overall AP and obtains significant performance\nimprovements on rare categories, surpassing all existing state-of-the-art\nmethods.

Here, the unlabelled images may\ncome from labelled classes or from novel ones. Existing recognition methods are\nnot able to deal with this setting, because they make several restrictive\nassumptions, such as the unlabelled instances only coming from known - or\nunknown - classes and the number of unknown classes being known a-priori. We\naddress the more unconstrained setting, naming it 'Generalized Category\nDiscovery', and challenge all these assumptions.

Next, we propose the use of vision\ntransformers with contrastive representation learning for this open world\nsetting.

    "abstract": "Humans move their hands and bodies together to communicate and solve tasks.\nCapturing and replicating such coordinated activity is critical for virtual\ncharacters that behave realistically. Surprisingly, most methods treat the 3D\nmodeling and tracking of bodies and hands separately. Here we formulate a model\nof hands and bodies interacting together and fit it to full-body 4D sequences.\nWhen scanning or capturing the full body in 3D, hands are small and often\npartially occluded, making their shape and pose hard to recover. To cope with\nlow-resolution, occlusion, and noise, we develop a new model called MANO (hand\nModel with Articulated and Non-rigid defOrmations). MANO is learned from around\n1000 high-resolution 3D scans of hands of 31 subjects in a wide variety of hand\nposes. The model is realistic, low-dimensional, captures non-rigid shape\nchanges with pose, is compatible with standard graphics packages, and can fit\nany human hand. MANO provides a compact mapping from hand poses to pose blend\nshape corrections and a linear manifold of pose synergies. We attach MANO to a\nstandard parameterized 3D body shape model (SMPL), resulting in a fully\narticulated body and hand model (SMPL+H). We illustrate SMPL+H by fitting\ncomplex, natural, activities of subjects captured with a 4D scanner. The\nfitting is fully automatic and results in full body models that move naturally\nwith detailed hand motions and a realism not seen before in full body\nperformance capture.

To address this, we first\ndevelop a unifying framework for studying constrained LMMSE estimation\nproblems. Using this framework, we expose an important structural property of\nall constrained LMMSE filters and show that they all involve an inherent\npreconditioning step. This parameterizes all such filters only by their\npreconditioners. Moreover, each filters is invariant to invertible linear\ntransformations of its preconditioner. We then clarify that merely constraining\nthe rank of the filters, leading to the well-known low-rank Wiener filter, does\nnot suitably address the problem of ill conditioning. Instead, we use a\nconstraint that explicitly requires solutions to be well conditioned in a\ncertain specific sense.

We show these two estimators\nconverge to the standard LMMSE filter as their truncated-power ratio converges\nto zero, but more slowly than the low-rank Wiener filter in terms of scaling\nlaw.

Another beneficial side effect is that\nthe computations of the first layer of the neural networks become additions\ninstead of multiplications because the input data become binary (and highly\nsparse).\nEmpirical comparisons with (normalized) random Fourier features (NRFF) are\nprovided. We also propose to reduce the model size of GCWSNet by count-sketch\nand develop the theory for analyzing the impact of using count-sketch on the\naccuracy of GCWS. Our analysis shows that an ``8-bit'' strategy should work\nwell in that we can always apply an 8-bit count-sketch hashing on the output of\nGCWS hashing without hurting the accuracy much. There are many other ways to\ntake advantage of GCWS when training deep neural networks. For example, one can\napply GCWS on the outputs of the last layer to boost the accuracy of trained\ndeep neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Arbitrage is one important revenue source for energy storage in electricity\nmarkets.

To study the investors'\nstrategic storage investments, we formulate a non-cooperative game between\ncompeting investors. Each investor decides the storage investment over a long\ninvestment horizon, and operates the storage for arbitrage revenues in the\ndaily electricity market. Different investors can deploy storage with different\ncharacteristics. Their decisions are coupled due to the market price that is\ndetermined by all the investors' decisions. We use market data from California\nISO to characterize the storage impact on the market price, based on which we\nestablish a centralized optimization problem to compute the market equilibrium.\nWe show that an increasing number of investors will increase the market\ncompetition, which reduces investors' profits but increases the total invested\nstorage capacity. Furthermore, we find that a slight increase in the storage\nefficiency (e.g., increased charge and discharge efficiency) can significantly\nimprove an investor's profit share in the market.",

In\nparticular, regarding to the spatio-temporal varying electricity price, we\nconsider incentive-aware customers and propose that the operator offers\nmonetary incentives to exchange time flexibility of customers. In this manner,\na win-win situation is achievable since time flexibility enables the fleet\noperator to obtain a routing and charging schedule with lower cost, whilst the\ncustomers receives monetary compensation. Specifically, we first devise a\nbi-level model whereby the fleet operator optimizes the routing and charging\nschedule jointly with a monetary incentive to reimburse the delivery time\nflexibility experienced by the customers. At the same time, the customers\nchoose the optimal time flexibility by minimizing its own cost. Second, we\ntackle the complexity resulting from the bi-level and nonlinear problem with an\nequivalent transformation method. Eventually, we reformulate the problem as a\nsingle-level optimization problem, which later is solved by proposed Benders\ndual decomposition method holding a faster convergence rate than the\ngeneralized Benders decomposition method.

For general distributional maps, the problem of finding\nsaddle points is in general computationally burdensome, even if the\ndistribution is known. To enable a tractable solution approach, we introduce\nthe notion of equilibrium points -- which are saddle points for the stationary\nstochastic minimax problem that they induce -- and provide conditions for their\nexistence and uniqueness. We demonstrate that the distance between the two\nclasses of solutions is bounded provided that the objective has a\nstrongly-convex-strongly-concave payoff and Lipschitz continuous distributional\nmap. We develop deterministic and stochastic primal-dual algorithms and\ndemonstrate their convergence to the equilibrium point. In particular, by\nmodeling errors emerging from a stochastic gradient estimator as sub-Weibull\nrandom variables, we provide error bounds in expectation and in high\nprobability that hold for each iteration; moreover, we show convergence to a\nneighborhood in expectation and almost surely.

However, most\nof these algorithms assume the degradation is fixed and known a priori. When\nthe real degradation is unknown or differs from assumption, both the\npre-processing module and the consequent high-level task such as object\ndetection would fail.

RestoreDet utilizes the downsampling\ndegradation as a kind of transformation for self-supervised signals to explore\nthe equivariant representation against various resolutions and other\ndegradation conditions. Specifically, we learn this intrinsic visual structure\nby encoding and decoding the degradation transformation from a pair of original\nand randomly degraded images. The framework could further take the advantage of\nadvanced SR architectures with an arbitrary resolution restoring decoder to\nreconstruct the original correspondence from the degraded input image. Both the\nrepresentation learning and object detection are optimized jointly in an\nend-to-end training fashion. RestoreDet is a generic framework that could be\nimplemented on any mainstream object detection architectures.

    "title": "Auto-Weighted Layer Representation Based View Synthesis Distortion  Estimation for 3-D Video Coding",
    "abstract": "Recently, various view synthesis distortion estimation models have been\nstudied to better serve for 3-D video coding. However, they can hardly model\nthe relationship quantitatively among different levels of depth changes,\ntexture degeneration, and the view synthesis distortion (VSD), which is crucial\nfor rate-distortion optimization and rate allocation. In this paper, an\nauto-weighted layer representation based view synthesis distortion estimation\nmodel is developed. Firstly, the sub-VSD (S-VSD) is defined according to the\nlevel of depth changes and their associated texture degeneration. After that, a\nset of theoretical derivations demonstrate that the VSD can be approximately\ndecomposed into the S-VSDs multiplied by their associated weights. To obtain\nthe S-VSDs, a layer-based representation of S-VSD is developed, where all the\npixels with the same level of depth changes are represented with a layer to\nenable efficient S-VSD calculation at the layer level. Meanwhile, a nonlinear\nmapping function is learnt to accurately represent the relationship between the\nVSD and S-VSDs, automatically providing weights for S-VSDs during the VSD\nestimation. To learn such function, a dataset of VSD and its associated S-VSDs\nare built. Experimental results show that the VSD can be accurately estimated\nwith the weights learnt by the nonlinear mapping function once its associated\nS-VSDs are available. The proposed method outperforms the relevant\nstate-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency. The dataset and\nsource code of the proposed method will be available at\nhttps://github.com/jianjin008/.",

    "title": "Effect of Prior-based Losses on Segmentation Performance: A Benchmark",
    "abstract": "Today, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated\nstate-of-the-art performance for medical image segmentation, on various imaging\nmodalities and tasks. Despite early success, segmentation networks may still\ngenerate anatomically aberrant segmentations, with holes or inaccuracies near\nthe object boundaries. To enforce anatomical plausibility, recent research\nstudies have focused on incorporating prior knowledge such as object shape or\nboundary, as constraints in the loss function. Prior integrated could be\nlow-level referring to reformulated representations extracted from the\nground-truth segmentations, or high-level representing external medical\ninformation such as the organ's shape or size. Over the past few years,\nprior-based losses exhibited a rising interest in the research field since they\nallow integration of expert knowledge while still being architecture-agnostic.\nHowever, given the diversity of prior-based losses on different medical imaging\nchallenges and tasks, it has become hard to identify what loss works best for\nwhich dataset. In this paper, we establish a benchmark of recent prior-based\nlosses for medical image segmentation. The main objective is to provide\nintuition onto which losses to choose given a particular task or dataset. To\nthis end, four low-level and high-level prior-based losses are selected. The\nconsidered losses are validated on 8 different datasets from a variety of\nmedical image segmentation challenges including the Decathlon, the ISLES and\nthe WMH challenge. Results show that whereas low-level prior-based losses can\nguarantee an increase in performance over the Dice loss baseline regardless of\nthe dataset characteristics, high-level prior-based losses can increase\nanatomical plausibility as per data characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Using only global annotations such as the image class labels,\nweakly-supervised learning methods allow CNN classifiers to jointly classify an\nimage, and yield the regions of interest associated with the predicted class.\nHowever, without any guidance at the pixel level, such methods may yield\ninaccurate regions. This problem is known to be more challenging with histology\nimages than with natural ones, since objects are less salient, structures have\nmore variations, and foreground and background regions have stronger\nsimilarities. Therefore, methods in computer vision literature for visual\ninterpretation of CNNs may not directly apply. In this work, we propose a\nsimple yet efficient method based on a composite loss function that leverages\ninformation from the fully negative samples. Our new loss function contains two\ncomplementary terms: the first exploits positive evidence collected from the\nCNN classifier, while the second leverages the fully negative samples from the\ntraining dataset. In particular, we equip a pre-trained classifier with a\ndecoder that allows refining the regions of interest. The same classifier is\nexploited to collect both the positive and negative evidence at the pixel level\nto train the decoder. This enables to take advantages of the fully negative\nsamples that occurs naturally in the data, without any additional supervision\nsignals and using only the image class as supervision. Compared to several\nrecent related methods, over the public benchmark GlaS for colon cancer and a\nCamelyon16 patch-based benchmark for breast cancer using three different\nbackbones, we show the substantial improvements introduced by our method. Our\nresults shows the benefits of using both negative and positive evidence, ie,\nthe one obtained from a classifier and the one naturally available in datasets.\nWe provide an ablation study of both terms.

    "abstract": "In single-photon LiDAR, photon-efficient imaging captures the 3D structure of\na scene by only several detected signal photons per pixel. The existing deep\nlearning models for this task are trained on simulated datasets, which poses\nthe domain shift challenge when applied to realistic scenarios. In this paper,\nwe propose a spatiotemporal inception network (STIN) for photon-efficient\nimaging, which is able to precisely predict the depth from a sparse and\nhigh-noise photon counting histogram by fully exploiting spatial and temporal\ninformation. Then the domain adversarial adaptation frameworks, including\ndomain-adversarial neural network and adversarial discriminative domain\nadaptation, are effectively applied to STIN to alleviate the domain shift\nproblem for realistic applications. Comprehensive experiments on the simulated\ndata generated from the NYU~v2 and the Middlebury datasets demonstrate that\nSTIN outperforms the state-of-the-art models at low signal-to-background ratios\nfrom 2:10 to 2:100. Moreover, experimental results on the real-world dataset\ncaptured by the single-photon imaging prototype show that the STIN with domain\nadversarial training achieves better generalization performance compared with\nthe state-of-the-arts as well as the baseline STIN trained by simulated data.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary diseases can cause severe respiratory problems, leading to sudden\ndeath if not treated timely. Many researchers have utilized deep learning\nsystems to diagnose pulmonary disorders using chest X-rays (CXRs). However,\nsuch systems require exhaustive training efforts on large-scale data to\neffectively diagnose chest abnormalities. Furthermore, procuring such\nlarge-scale data is often infeasible and impractical, especially for rare\ndiseases. With the recent advances in incremental learning, researchers have\nperiodically tuned deep neural networks to learn different classification tasks\nwith few training examples. Although, such systems can resist catastrophic\nforgetting, they treat the knowledge representations independently of each\nother, and this limits their classification performance. Also, to the best of\nour knowledge, there is no incremental learning-driven image diagnostic\nframework that is specifically designed to screen pulmonary disorders from the\nCXRs. To address this, we present a novel framework that can learn to screen\ndifferent chest abnormalities incrementally. In addition to this, the proposed\nframework is penalized through an incremental learning loss function that\ninfers Bayesian theory to recognize structural and semantic inter-dependencies\nbetween incrementally learned knowledge representations to diagnose the\npulmonary diseases effectively, regardless of the scanner specifications. We\ntested the proposed framework on five public CXR datasets containing different\nchest abnormalities, where it outperformed various state-of-the-art system\nthrough various metrics.",
