    "title": "Posture Prediction for Healthy Sitting using a Smart Chair",
    "abstract": "Poor sitting habits have been identified as a risk factor to musculoskeletal\ndisorders and lower back pain especially on the elderly, disabled people, and\noffice workers. In the current computerized world, even while involved in\nleisure or work activity, people tend to spend most of their days sitting at\ncomputer desks. This can result in spinal pain and related problems. Therefore,\na means to remind people about their sitting habits and provide recommendations\nto counterbalance, such as physical exercise, is important. Posture recognition\nfor seated postures have not received enough attention as most works focus on\nstanding postures. Wearable sensors, pressure or force sensors, videos and\nimages were used for posture recognition in the literature. The aim of this\nstudy is to build Machine Learning models for classifying sitting posture of a\nperson by analyzing data collected from a chair platted with two 32 by 32\npressure sensors at its seat and backrest. Models were built using five\nalgorithms: Random Forest (RF), Gaussian Na\\\"ive Bayes, Logistic Regression,\nSupport Vector Machine and Deep Neural Network (DNN). All the models are\nevaluated using KFold cross-validation technique. This paper presents\nexperiments conducted using the two separate datasets, controlled and\nrealistic, and discusses results achieved at classifying six sitting postures.\nAverage classification accuracies of 98% and 97% were achieved on the\ncontrolled and realistic datasets, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Few-sample compression aims to compress a big redundant model into a small\ncompact one with only few samples. If we fine-tune models with these limited\nfew samples directly, models will be vulnerable to overfit and learn almost\nnothing. Hence, previous methods optimize the compressed model layer-by-layer\nand try to make every layer have the same outputs as the corresponding layer in\nthe teacher model, which is cumbersome. In this paper, we propose a new\nframework named Mimicking then Replacing (MiR) for few-sample compression,\nwhich firstly urges the pruned model to output the same features as the\nteacher's in the penultimate layer, and then replaces teacher's layers before\npenultimate with a well-tuned compact one. Unlike previous layer-wise\nreconstruction methods, our MiR optimizes the entire network holistically,\nwhich is not only simple and effective, but also unsupervised and general. MiR\noutperforms previous methods with large margins. Codes will be available soon.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by potential financial gain, companies may hire fraudster groups to\nwrite fake reviews to either demote competitors or promote their own\nbusinesses. Such groups are considerably more successful in misleading\ncustomers, as people are more likely to be influenced by the opinion of a large\ngroup. To detect such groups, a common model is to represent fraudster groups'\nstatic networks, consequently overlooking the longitudinal behavior of a\nreviewer thus the dynamics of co-review relations among reviewers in a group.\nHence, these approaches are incapable of excluding outlier reviewers, which are\nfraudsters intentionally camouflaging themselves in a group and genuine\nreviewers happen to co-review in fraudster groups. To address this issue, in\nthis work, we propose to first capitalize on the effectiveness of the HIN-RNN\nin both reviewers' representation learning while capturing the collaboration\nbetween reviewers, we first utilize the HIN-RNN to model the co-review\nrelations of reviewers in a group in a fixed time window of 28 days. We refer\nto this as spatial relation learning representation to signify the\ngeneralisability of this work to other networked scenarios. Then we use an RNN\non the spatial relations to predict the spatio-temporal relations of reviewers\nin the group. In the third step, a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) refines the\nreviewers' vector representations using these predicted relations. These\nrefined representations are then used to remove outlier reviewers. The average\nof the remaining reviewers' representation is then fed to a simple fully\nconnected layer to predict if the group is a fraudster group or not. Exhaustive\nexperiments of the proposed approach showed a 5% (4%), 12% (5%), 12% (5%)\nimprovement over three of the most recent approaches on precision, recall, and\nF1-value over the Yelp (Amazon) dataset, respectively.",

We introduce MERLOT Reserve, a model\nthat represents videos jointly over time -- through a new training objective\nthat learns from audio, subtitles, and video frames. Given a video, we replace\nsnippets of text and audio with a MASK token; the model learns by choosing the\ncorrect masked-out snippet. Our objective learns faster than alternatives, and\nperforms well at scale: we pretrain on 20 million YouTube videos.\nEmpirical results show that MERLOT Reserve learns strong representations\nabout videos through all constituent modalities. When finetuned, it sets a new\nstate-of-the-art on both VCR and TVQA, outperforming prior work by 5% and 7%\nrespectively. Ablations show that both tasks benefit from audio pretraining --\neven VCR, a QA task centered around images (without sound). Moreover, our\nobjective enables out-of-the-box prediction, revealing strong multimodal\ncommonsense understanding. In a fully zero-shot setting, our model obtains\ncompetitive results on four video understanding tasks, even outperforming\nsupervised approaches on the recently proposed Situated Reasoning (STAR)\nbenchmark.\nWe analyze why incorporating audio leads to better vision-language\nrepresentations, suggesting significant opportunities for future research.

    "abstract": "Automating information extraction from form-like documents at scale is a\npressing need due to its potential impact on automating business workflows\nacross many industries like financial services, insurance, and healthcare. The\nkey challenge is that form-like documents in these business workflows can be\nlaid out in virtually infinitely many ways; hence, a good solution to this\nproblem should generalize to documents with unseen layouts and languages. A\nsolution to this problem requires a holistic understanding of both the textual\nsegments and the visual cues within a document, which is non-trivial. While the\nnatural language processing and computer vision communities are starting to\ntackle this problem, there has not been much focus on (1) data-efficiency, and\n(2) ability to generalize across different document types and languages.\nIn this paper, we show that when we have only a small number of labeled\ndocuments for training (~50), a straightforward transfer learning approach from\na considerably structurally-different larger labeled corpus yields up to a 27\nF1 point improvement over simply training on the small corpus in the target\ndomain. We improve on this with a simple multi-domain transfer learning\napproach, that is currently in production use, and show that this yields up to\na further 8 F1 point improvement. We make the case that data efficiency is\ncritical to enable information extraction systems to scale to handle hundreds\nof different document-types, and learning good representations is critical to\naccomplishing this.",

Vertical federated\nlearning or feature-based federated learning applies to the cases that\ndifferent data sources share the same sample ID space but differ in feature\nspace. To ensure the data owners' long-term engagement, it is critical to\nobjectively assess the contribution from each data source and recompense them\naccordingly. The Shapley value (SV) is a provably fair contribution valuation\nmetric originated from cooperative game theory. However, computing the SV\nrequires extensively retraining the model on each subset of data sources, which\ncauses prohibitively high communication costs in federated learning. We propose\na contribution valuation metric called vertical federated Shapley value\n(VerFedSV) based on SV.

Through an annotation of events in story sentences, we found that the\nstory types contain similar proportions of major salient events, but that the\nautobiographical stories are denser in factual minor events. Furthermore, in\ncomparison to imagined stories, autobiographical stories contain more concrete\nwords and words related to the first person, cognitive processes, time, space,\nnumbers, social words, and core drives and needs.

    "abstract": "Vehicular Controller Area Networks (CANs) are susceptible to cyber attacks of\ndifferent levels of sophistication. Fabrication attacks are the easiest to\nadminister -- an adversary simply sends (extra) frames on a CAN -- but also the\neasiest to detect because they disrupt frame frequency. To overcome time-based\ndetection methods, adversaries must administer masquerade attacks by sending\nframes in lieu of (and therefore at the expected time of) benign frames but\nwith malicious payloads. Research efforts have proven that CAN attacks, and\nmasquerade attacks in particular, can affect vehicle functionality. Examples\ninclude causing unintended acceleration, deactivation of vehicle's brakes, as\nwell as steering the vehicle. We hypothesize that masquerade attacks modify the\nnuanced correlations of CAN signal time series and how they cluster together.\nTherefore, changes in cluster assignments should indicate anomalous behavior.\nWe confirm this hypothesis by leveraging our previously developed capability\nfor reverse engineering CAN signals (i.e., CAN-D [Controller Area Network\nDecoder]) and focus on advancing the state of the art for detecting masquerade\nattacks by analyzing time series extracted from raw CAN frames. Specifically,\nwe demonstrate that masquerade attacks can be detected by computing time series\nclustering similarity using hierarchical clustering on the vehicle's CAN\nsignals (time series) and comparing the clustering similarity across CAN\ncaptures with and without attacks. We test our approach in a previously\ncollected CAN dataset with masquerade attacks (i.e., the ROAD dataset) and\ndevelop a forensic tool as a proof of concept to demonstrate the potential of\nthe proposed approach for detecting CAN masquerade attacks.",

    "abstract": "In this research work, the 2D structure of the germanene layer is compounded\nwith 2D group-III phosphides: AlP and GaP. The planar structure of AlP and\nlow-buckled GaP have been taken to form the bilayer patterns. In each case,\nthree stacking patterns are considered, and their relaxed interlayer distance\nand binding energy have been reported. The binding energy being around in the\nrange between ~150 to 210 meV shows the existence of weak van der Waals\ninteractions between the layers. The heterostructures containing germanene and\nthese two phosphides show an opening of a large indirect bandgap of magnitude\nrange of ~200 meV to 600 meV, which can be tuned by changing interlayer\ndistance and by incorporating bi-axial compressive and tensile strain. Although\ntheir normal bandgap, which significantly changes with SOC, is an indirect one,\nwhilst tunning the interlayer distance band gap jumps from unsymmetrical point\nto symmetrical Dirac cones and becomes direct on K points. The charge carrier\nmostly concentrates on the p-orbitals of the germanene in the conduction\nregions; thus, the electrical properties of germanene will be retained, and the\ncarrier will provide a much faster device response property. The absence of the\nphosphides influence makes them the intended substrate for growing the\ngermanene layer on top of that. Again, due to the bandgap at Dirac cones being\nopened and jumps between the Dirac cones and band gap changes with SOC\ntropological insulator can be formed, and Quantum Spin Hall effect may exist.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach for identification of vulnerable IoT\napplications. The approach focuses on a category of vulnerabilities that leads\nto sensitive information leakage which can be identified by using taint flow\nanalysis. Tainted flows vulnerability is very much impacted by the structure of\nthe program and the order of the statements in the code, designing an approach\nto detect such vulnerability needs to take into consideration such information\nin order to provide precise results. In this paper, we propose and develop an\napproach, FlowsMiner, that mines features from the code related to program\nstructure such as control statements and methods, in addition to program's\nstatement order. FlowsMiner, generates features in the form of tainted flows.\nWe developed, Flows2Vec, a tool that transform the features recovered by\nFlowsMiner into vectors, which are then used to aid the process of machine\nlearning by providing a flow's aware model building process. The resulting\nmodel is capable of accurately classify applications as vulnerable if the\nvulnerability is exhibited by changes in the order of statements in source\ncode. When compared to a base Bag of Words (BoW) approach, the experiments show\nthat the proposed approach has improved the AUC of the prediction models for\nall algorithms and the best case for Corpus1 dataset is improved from 0.91 to\n0.94 and for Corpus2 from 0.56 to 0.96",

    "title": "A Direct Parallel-in-Time Quasi-Boundary Value Method for Inverse  Space-Dependent Source Problems",
    "abstract": "Inverse source problems arise often in real-world applications, such as\nlocalizing unknown groundwater contaminant sources. Being different from\nTikhonov regularization, the quasi-boundary value method has been proposed and\nanalyzed as an effective way for regularizing such inverse source problems,\nwhich was shown to achieve an optimal order convergence rate under suitable\nassumptions. However, fast direct or iterative solvers for the resulting\nall-at-once large-scale linear systems have been rarely studied in the\nliterature. In this work, we first proposed and analyzed a modified\nquasi-boundary value method, and then developed a diagonalization-based\nparallel-in-time (PinT) direct solver, which can achieve a dramatic speedup in\nCPU times when compared with MATLAB's sparse direct solver. In particular, the\ntime-discretization matrix $B$ is shown to be diagonalizable, and the condition\nnumber of its eigenvector matrix $V$ is proven to exhibit quadratic growth,\nwhich guarantees the roundoff errors due to diagonalization is well controlled.\nSeveral 1D and 2D examples are presented to demonstrate the very promising\ncomputational efficiency of our proposed method, where the CPU times in 2D\ncases can be speedup by three orders of magnitude.",

We first identify\nand analyze three approaches to this problem -- conditional GAN training from\nscratch, fine-tuning, and input reprogramming. Our analysis reveals that when\nthe amount of labeled data is small, input reprogramming performs the best.\nMotivated by real-world scenarios with scarce labeled data, we focus on the\ninput reprogramming approach and carefully analyze the existing algorithm.\nAfter identifying a few critical issues of the previous input reprogramming\napproach, we propose a new algorithm called InRep+. Our algorithm InRep+\naddresses the existing issues with the novel uses of invertible neural networks\nand Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning. Via extensive experiments, we show that\nInRep+ outperforms all existing methods, particularly when label information is\nscarce, noisy, and/or imbalanced.

    "abstract": "Although mission-critical applications require the use of deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs), their continuous execution at mobile devices results in a\nsignificant increase in energy consumption. While edge offloading can decrease\nenergy consumption, erratic patterns in channel quality, network and edge\nserver load can lead to severe disruption of the system's key operations. An\nalternative approach, called split computing, generates compressed\nrepresentations within the model (called \"bottlenecks\"), to reduce bandwidth\nusage and energy consumption. Prior work has proposed approaches that introduce\nadditional layers, to the detriment of energy consumption and latency. For this\nreason, we propose a new framework called BottleFit, which, in addition to\ntargeted DNN architecture modifications, includes a novel training strategy to\nachieve high accuracy even with strong compression rates. We apply BottleFit on\ncutting-edge DNN models in image classification, and show that BottleFit\nachieves 77.1% data compression with up to 0.6% accuracy loss on ImageNet\ndataset, while state of the art such as SPINN loses up to 6% in accuracy. We\nexperimentally measure the power consumption and latency of an image\nclassification application running on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board (GPU-based)\nand a Raspberry PI board (GPU-less). We show that BottleFit decreases power\nconsumption and latency respectively by up to 49% and 89% with respect to\n(w.r.t.) local computing and by 37% and 55% w.r.t. edge offloading. We also\ncompare BottleFit with state-of-the-art autoencoders-based approaches, and show\nthat (i) BottleFit reduces power consumption and execution time respectively by\nup to 54% and 44% on the Jetson and 40% and 62% on Raspberry PI; (ii) the size\nof the head model executed on the mobile device is 83 times smaller.

    "abstract": "Model predictive control (MPC) has become a hot cake technology for various\napplications due to its ability to handle multi-input multi-output systems with\nphysical constraints. The optimization solvers require considerable time,\nlimiting their embedded implementation for real-time control. To overcome the\nbottleneck of traditional quadratic programming (QP) solvers, this paper\nproposes a robust penalty method (RPM) to solve an optimization problem in a\nlinear MPC. The main idea of RPM is to solve an unconstrained QP problem using\nBroyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shannon (BFGS) algorithm. The beauty of this method\nis that it can find optimal solutions even if initial conditions are in an\ninfeasible region, which makes it robust. Moreover, the RPM is computationally\ninexpensive as compared to the traditional QP solvers. The proposed RPM is\nimplemented on resource-limited embedded hardware (STM32 microcontroller), and\nits performance is validated with a case study of a citation aircraft control\nproblem. We show the hardware-in-the-loop co-simulation results of the proposed\nRPM and compared them with the active set method (ASM) and interior point\nmethod (IPM) QP solvers. The performance of MPC with the aforementioned solvers\nis compared by considering the optimality, time complexity, and ease of\nhardware implementation. Presented results show that the proposed RPM gives the\nsame optimality as ASM and IPM, and outperforms them in terms of speed.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present the Amharic Speech Emotion Dataset (ASED), which\ncovers four dialects (Gojjam, Wollo, Shewa and Gonder) and five different\nemotions (neutral, fearful, happy, sad and angry). We believe it is the first\nSpeech Emotion Recognition (SER) dataset for the Amharic language. 65 volunteer\nparticipants, all native speakers, recorded 2,474 sound samples, two to four\nseconds in length. Eight judges assigned emotions to the samples with high\nagreement level (Fleiss kappa = 0.8). The resulting dataset is freely available\nfor download. Next, we developed a four-layer variant of the well-known VGG\nmodel which we call VGGb. Three experiments were then carried out using VGGb\nfor SER, using ASED. First, we investigated whether Mel-spectrogram features or\nMel-frequency Cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features work best for Amharic. This\nwas done by training two VGGb SER models on ASED, one using Mel-spectrograms\nand the other using MFCC. Four forms of training were tried, standard\ncross-validation, and three variants based on sentences, dialects and speaker\ngroups. Thus, a sentence used for training would not be used for testing, and\nthe same for a dialect and speaker group. The conclusion was that MFCC features\nare superior under all four training schemes. MFCC was therefore adopted for\nExperiment 2, where VGGb and three other existing models were compared on ASED:\nRESNet50, Alex-Net and LSTM. VGGb was found to have very good accuracy (90.73%)\nas well as the fastest training time. In Experiment 3, the performance of VGGb\nwas compared when trained on two existing SER datasets, RAVDESS (English) and\nEMO-DB (German) as well as on ASED (Amharic). Results are comparable across\nthese languages, with ASED being the highest. This suggests that VGGb can be\nsuccessfully applied to other languages. We hope that ASED will encourage\nresearchers to experiment with other models for Amharic SER.",

In this paper, we propose to use binary block Walsh-Hadamard transform\n(WHT) instead of the Fourier transform. We use WHT-based binary layers to\nreplace some of the regular convolution layers in deep neural networks. We\nutilize both one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) binary WHTs in\nthis paper. In both 1-D and 2-D layers, we compute the binary WHT of the input\nfeature map and denoise the WHT domain coefficients using a nonlinearity which\nis obtained by combining soft-thresholding with the tanh function. After\ndenoising, we compute the inverse WHT. We use 1D-WHT to replace the $1\\times 1$\nconvolutional layers, and 2D-WHT layers can replace the 3$\\times$3 convolution\nlayers and Squeeze-and-Excite layers. 2D-WHT layers with trainable weights can\nbe also inserted before the Global Average Pooling (GAP) layers to assist the\ndense layers. In this way, we can reduce the number of trainable parameters\nsignificantly with a slight decrease in trainable parameters. In this paper, we\nimplement the WHT layers into MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3-Large, and ResNet to\nreduce the number of parameters significantly with negligible accuracy loss.\nMoreover, according to our speed test, the 2D-FWHT layer runs about 24 times as\nfast as the regular $3\\times 3$ convolution with 19.51\\% less RAM usage in an\nNVIDIA Jetson Nano experiment.",

As a first step to address a part of this issue, we designed\na privacy controller, CONFIDANT, for conversational social robots, capable of\nusing contextual metadata (e.g., sentiment, relationships, topic) from\nconversations to model privacy boundaries.

Our second study (n=95) evaluated the effectiveness\nand accuracy of the privacy controller in human-robot interaction scenarios by\ncomparing a robot that used our privacy controller against a baseline robot\nwith no privacy controls. Our results demonstrate that the robot with the\nprivacy controller outperforms the robot without the privacy controller in\nprivacy-awareness, trustworthiness, and social-awareness.

Unlike typical predict-then-plan approaches,\ngame-theoretic planning considers how one vehicle's plan will affect the\nactions of another. Recent work has demonstrated significant improvements in\nthe time required to find local Nash equilibria in general-sum games with\nnonlinear objectives and constraints. When applied trivially to driving, these\nworks assume all vehicles in a scene play a game together, which can result in\nintractable computation times for dense traffic.

    "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to recommend suitable items to\nusers through natural language conversations. For developing effective CRSs, a\nmajor technical issue is how to accurately infer user preference from very\nlimited conversation context. To address issue, a promising solution is to\nincorporate external data for enriching the context information. However, prior\nstudies mainly focus on designing fusion models tailored for some specific type\nof external data, which is not general to model and utilize multi-type external\ndata.\nTo effectively leverage multi-type external data, we propose a novel\ncoarse-to-fine contrastive learning framework to improve data semantic fusion\nfor CRS. In our approach, we first extract and represent multi-grained semantic\nunits from different data signals, and then align the associated multi-type\nsemantic units in a coarse-to-fine way. To implement this framework, we design\nboth coarse-grained and fine-grained procedures for modeling user preference,\nwhere the former focuses on more general, coarse-grained semantic fusion and\nthe latter focuses on more specific, fine-grained semantic fusion. Such an\napproach can be extended to incorporate more kinds of external data. Extensive\nexperiments on two public CRS datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of\nour approach in both recommendation and conversation tasks.",

    "abstract": "Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems excel at diverse tasks, from\nimage classification to strategy games, even outperforming humans in many of\nthese domains. After making astounding progress in language learning in the\nrecent decade, AI systems, however, seem to approach the ceiling that does not\nreflect important aspects of human communicative capacities. Unlike human\nlearners, communicative AI systems often fail to systematically generalize to\nnew data, suffer from sample inefficiency, fail to capture common-sense\nsemantic knowledge, and do not translate to real-world communicative\nsituations. Cognitive Science offers several insights on how AI could move\nforward from this point. This paper aims to: (1) suggest that the dominant\ncognitively-inspired AI directions, based on nativist and symbolic paradigms,\nlack necessary substantiation and concreteness to guide progress in modern AI,\nand (2) articulate an alternative, \"grounded\", perspective on AI advancement,\ninspired by Embodied, Embedded, Extended, and Enactive Cognition (4E) research.\nI review results on 4E research lines in Cognitive Science to distinguish the\nmain aspects of naturalistic learning conditions that play causal roles for\nhuman language development. I then use this analysis to propose a list of\nconcrete, implementable components for building \"grounded\" linguistic\nintelligence. These components include embodying machines in a\nperception-action cycle, equipping agents with active exploration mechanisms so\nthey can build their own curriculum, allowing agents to gradually develop motor\nabilities to promote piecemeal language development, and endowing the agents\nwith adaptive feedback from their physical and social environment. I hope that\nthese ideas can direct AI research towards building machines that develop\nhuman-like language abilities through their experiences with the world.",

    "abstract": "We routinely communicate distinct social and emotional sentiments through\nnuanced touch. For example, we might gently hold another's arm to offer a sense\nof calm, yet intensively hold another's arm to express excitement or anxiety.\nAs this example indicates, distinct sentiments may be shaped by the subtlety in\none's touch delivery. This work investigates how slight distinctions in\nskin-to-skin contact influence both the recognition of cued emotional messages\n(e.g., anger, sympathy) and the rating of emotional content (i.e., arousal,\nvalence). By self-selecting preferred gestures (e.g., holding, stroking),\ntouchers convey distinct messages by touching the receiver's forearm.\nSkin-to-skin contact attributes (e.g., velocity, depth, area) are optically\ntracked in high resolution. Contact is then examined within gesture, between\nmessages. The results indicate touchers subtly, but significantly, vary contact\nattributes of a gesture to communicate distinct messages, which are\nrecognizable by receivers. This tuning also correlates with receivers' arousal\nand valence. For instance, arousal increases with velocity for stroking, and\ndepth for holding. Moreover, as shown here with human-to-human touch, valence\nis tied with velocity, which is the same trend as reported with brushes. The\nfindings indicate that subtle nuance in skin-to-skin contact is important in\nconveying social messages and inducing emotions.",

Such heterogeneous network\nembedding (HNE) methods effectively harness the heterogeneity of small-scale\nHINs.

In DeHIN, we generate a distributed parallel\npipeline that utilizes hypergraphs in order to infuse parallelization into the\nHNE task. DeHIN presents a context preserving partition mechanism that\ninnovatively formulates a large HIN as a hypergraph, whose hyperedges connect\nsemantically similar nodes. Our framework then adopts a decentralized strategy\nto efficiently partition HINs by adopting a tree-like pipeline. Then, each\nresulting subnetwork is assigned to a distributed worker, which employs the\ndeep information maximization theorem to locally learn node embeddings from the\npartition it receives. We further devise a novel embedding alignment scheme to\nprecisely project independently learned node embeddings from all subnetworks\nonto a common vector space, thus allowing for downstream tasks like link\nprediction and node classification.",

Specifically, we consider optimizing deep\nlinear networks which have a layer with one neuron under quadratic loss. We\ndescribe the convergent point of trajectories with arbitrary starting point\nunder gradient flow, including the paths which converge to one of the saddle\npoints or the original point. We also show specific convergence rates of\ntrajectories that converge to the global minimizer by stages. To achieve these\nresults, this paper mainly extends the machinery in Eftekhari's work to\nprovably identify the rank-stable set and the global minimizer convergent set.\nWe also give specific examples to show the necessity of our definitions.\nCrucially, as far as we know, our results appear to be the first to give a\nnon-local global analysis of linear neural networks from arbitrary initialized\npoints, rather than the lazy training regime which has dominated the literature\nof neural networks, and restricted benign initialization in Eftekhari's work.\nWe also note that extending our results to general linear networks without one\nhidden neuron assumption remains a challenging open problem.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers a network of a multi-antenna array base station (BS) and\na reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to deliver both information to\ninformation users (IUs) and power to energy users (EUs). The RIS links the\nconnection between the IUs and the BS as there is no direct path between the\nformer and the latter. The EUs are located nearby the BS in order to\neffectively harvest energy from the high-power signal from the BS, while the\nmuch weaker signal reflected from the RIS hardly contributes to the EUs'\nharvested energy. To provide reliable links for all users over the same\ntime-slot, we adopt the transmit time-switching (transmit-TS) approach, under\nwhich information and energy are delivered over different time-slot fractions.\nThis allows us to rely on conjugate beamforming for energy links and\nzero-forcing/regularized zero-forcing beamforming (ZFB/RZFB) and on the\nprogrammable reflecting coefficients (PRCs) of the RIS for information links.\nWe show that ZFB/RZFB and PRCs can be still separately optimized in their joint\ndesign, where PRC optimization is based on iterative closed-form expressions.\nWe then develop a path-following algorithm for solving our max-min IU\nthroughput optimization problem subject to a realistic constraint on the\nquality-of-energy-service in terms of the EUs' harvested energy thresholds.

    "abstract": "Transformers have been successful in many vision tasks, thanks to their\ncapability of capturing long-range dependency. However, their quadratic\ncomputational complexity poses a major obstacle for applying them to vision\ntasks requiring dense predictions, such as object detection, feature matching,\nstereo, etc. We introduce QuadTree Attention, which reduces the computational\ncomplexity from quadratic to linear. Our quadtree transformer builds token\npyramids and computes attention in a coarse-to-fine manner. At each level, the\ntop K patches with the highest attention scores are selected, such that at the\nnext level, attention is only evaluated within the relevant regions\ncorresponding to these top K patches. We demonstrate that quadtree attention\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in various vision tasks, e.g. with 4.0%\nimprovement in feature matching on ScanNet, about 50% flops reduction in stereo\nmatching, 0.4-1.5% improvement in top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification,\n1.2-1.8% improvement on COCO object detection, and 0.7-2.4% improvement on\nsemantic segmentation over previous state-of-the-art transformers.

    "abstract": "Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) is an important research topic across multimodal\ncomputing and information retrieval, which takes one type of data as the query\nto retrieve relevant data of another type, and has been widely used in many\nreal-world applications. Recently, the vision-language pre-trained model\nrepresented by CLIP has demonstrated its superiority of learning visual and\ntextual representations and its impressive performance on various vision and\nlanguage related tasks. Although CLIP as well as the previous pre-trained\nmodels have shown great performance improvement in unsupervised CMR, the\nperformance and impact of these pre-trained models on supervised CMR were\nrarely explored due to the lack of multimodal class-level associations.\nIn this paper, we take CLIP as the current representative vision-language\npre-trained model to conduct a comprehensive empirical study and provide\ninsights on its performance and impact on supervised CMR. To this end, we first\npropose a novel model CLIP4CMR (\\textbf{CLIP For} supervised\n\\textbf{C}ross-\\textbf{M}odal \\textbf{R}etrieval) that employs pre-trained CLIP\nas backbone network to perform supervised CMR. We then revisit the existing\nloss function design in CMR, including the most common pair-wise losses,\nclass-wise losses and hybrid ones, and provide insights on applying CLIP.\nMoreover, we investigate several concerned issues in supervised CMR and provide\nnew perspectives for this field via CLIP4CMR, including the robustness to\nmodality imbalance and the sensitivity to hyper-parameters. Extensive\nexperimental results show that the CLIP4CMR achieves SOTA results with\nsignificant improvements on the benchmark datasets Wikipedia, NUS-WIDE,\nPascal-Sentence and XmediaNet.

    "abstract": "In order to satisfy the delay requirements of telecommunication systems, in\nthis paper, we present a cooperative network with the short packet transmission\nin the Rayleigh fading channel. The desired relay can be implemented as a\ntwo-way half-duplex (HD) or a two-way full-duplex (FD). Also, for more accurate\nsatisfaction and reduction of communication delays, sending and receiving with\nshort packets is considered. Effective capacity appropriately measures the\ntransmission rate under the delay constraint. Therefore, it is considered as a\nperformance evaluation criterion here. With a two-way relay, two nodes exchange\ndata with each other using a relay simultaneously. The priorities and\nrequirements of the two nodes are not necessarily the same. Therefore, to\nincrease performance, the system is modeled and solved as a multi-objective\nproblem. In this way, the available power in the network is divided between the\nrelay and two nodes, and the effective capacity of the two nodes is maximized.\nDepending on the different conditions, the optimal amount of allocated power to\nrelay and nodes is calculated. However, due to the complexity and time\nconsuming calculations, an approximate method which speeds up the calculation\nis presented. The approximated solution has a very close performance to the\noptimal allocated power. Finally, various comparisons have been made in\ndifferent conditions between the performance of two-way HD and two-way FD\nrelays. The improvement of multi-objective power allocation has been shown,\nespecially when the relay is not located in the middle of two nodes.",

To date, VFL has become a de facto\nsolution to securely learn a model among organizations, allowing knowledge to\nbe shared without compromising privacy of any individual organizations.\nDespite the prosperous development of VFL systems, we find that certain\ninputs of a participant, named adversarial dominating inputs (ADIs), can\ndominate the joint inference towards the direction of the adversary's will and\nforce other (victim) participants to make negligible contributions, losing\nrewards that are usually offered regarding the importance of their\ncontributions in collaborative learning scenarios.\nWe conduct a systematic study on ADIs by first proving their existence in\ntypical VFL systems. We then propose gradient-based methods to synthesize ADIs\nof various formats and exploit common VFL systems. We further launch greybox\nfuzz testing, guided by the resiliency score of \"victim\" participants, to\nperturb adversary-controlled inputs and systematically explore the VFL attack\nsurface in a privacy-preserving manner.

    "abstract": "In a modern power system, real-time data on power generation/consumption and\nits relevant features are stored in various distributed parties, including\nhousehold meters, transformer stations and external organizations. To fully\nexploit the underlying patterns of these distributed data for accurate power\nprediction, federated learning is needed as a collaborative but\nprivacy-preserving training scheme. However, current federated learning\nframeworks are polarized towards addressing either the horizontal or vertical\nseparation of data, and tend to overlook the case where both are present.\nFurthermore, in mainstream horizontal federated learning frameworks, only\nartificial neural networks are employed to learn the data patterns, which are\nconsidered less accurate and interpretable compared to tree-based models on\ntabular datasets. To this end, we propose a hybrid federated learning framework\nbased on XGBoost, for distributed power prediction from real-time external\nfeatures. In addition to introducing boosted trees to improve accuracy and\ninterpretability, we combine horizontal and vertical federated learning, to\naddress the scenario where features are scattered in local heterogeneous\nparties and samples are scattered in various local districts. Moreover, we\ndesign a dynamic task allocation scheme such that each party gets a fair share\nof information, and the computing power of each party can be fully leveraged to\nboost training efficiency.

It causes severe biases of the\nhead classes (with majority samples) against the tailed ones. This renders \"how\nto appropriately define and alleviate the bias\" one of the most important\nissues. Prior works mainly use label distribution or mean score information to\nindicate a coarse-grained bias. In this paper, we explore to excavate the\nconfusion matrix, which carries the fine-grained misclassification details, to\nrelieve the pairwise biases, generalizing the coarse one. To this end, we\npropose a novel Pairwise Class Balance (PCB) method, built upon a confusion\nmatrix which is updated during training to accumulate the ongoing prediction\npreferences. PCB generates fightback soft labels for regularization during\ntraining. Besides, an iterative learning paradigm is developed to support a\nprogressive and smooth regularization in such debiasing.

    "abstract": "Herein, minimization of time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) in an energy\nharvesting (EH) source equipped remote sensing setting is considered. The EH\nsource opportunistically samples one or multiple processes over discrete time\ninstants, and sends the status updates to a sink node over a time-varying\nwireless link. At any discrete time instant, the EH node decides whether to\nascertain the link quality using its stored energy (called probing) and then,\ndecides whether to sample a process and communicate the data based on the\nchannel probe outcome. The trade-off is between the freshness of information\navailable at the sink node and the available energy at the energy buffer of the\nsource node. To this end, infinite horizon Markov decision process (MDP) theory\nis used to formulate the problem of minimization of time-averaged expected AoI\nfor a single energy harvesting source node. The following two scenarios are\nconsidered: (i) energy arrival process and channel fading process are\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across time, (ii) energy\narrival process and channel fading process are Markovian. In the i.i.d.\nsetting, after probing a channel, the optimal source node sampling policy is\nshown to be a threshold policy involving the instantaneous age of the process,\nthe available energy in the buffer and the instantaneous channel quality as the\ndecision variables. Also, for unknown channel state and energy harvesting\ncharacteristics, a variant of the Q-learning algorithm is proposed for the\ntwo-stage action taken by the source, that seeks to learn the optimal status\nupdate policy over time. For Markovian channel and Markovian energy arrival\nprocesses, the problem is again formulated as an MDP, and a learning algorithm\nis provided to handle unknown dynamics. Finally, numerical results are provided\nto demonstrate the policy structures and performance trade-offs.",

It is useful in applications with nested parallelism, particularly\nwhere the amount of nested parallelism is irregular and cannot be predicted\nbeforehand. However, prior works have shown that dynamic parallelism may impose\na high performance penalty when a large number of small grids are launched. The\nlarge number of launches results in high launch latency due to congestion, and\nthe small grid sizes result in hardware underutilization.\nTo address this issue, we propose a compiler framework for optimizing the use\nof dynamic parallelism in applications with nested parallelism. The framework\nfeatures three key optimizations: thresholding, coarsening, and aggregation.\nThresholding involves launching a grid dynamically only if the number of child\nthreads exceeds some threshold, and serializing the child threads in the parent\nthread otherwise. Coarsening involves executing the work of multiple thread\nblocks by a single coarsened block to amortize the common work across them.\nAggregation involves combining multiple child grids into a single aggregated\ngrid.\nOur evaluation shows that our compiler framework improves the performance of\napplications with nested parallelism by a geometric mean of 43.0x over\napplications that use dynamic parallelism, 8.7x over applications that do not\nuse dynamic parallelism, and 3.6x over applications that use dynamic\nparallelism with aggregation alone as proposed in prior work.",

Typically, camera travel is performed via Fly-Through or\nFly-Over techniques that enable semi-automatic traveling through a constrained,\nwell-defined path at user-controlled speeds. However, Fly-Through is known to\nlimit the visibility of lesions located behind or inside haustral folds. At the\nsame time, Fly-Over requires splitting the entire colon visualization into two\nspecific halves. In this paper, we study the effect of immersive Fly-Through\nand Fly-Over techniques on lesion detection and introduce a camera travel\ntechnique that maintains a fixed camera orientation throughout the entire\nmedial axis path. While these techniques have been studied in non-VR desktop\nenvironments, their performance is not well understood in VR setups. We\nperformed a comparative study to ascertain which camera travel technique is\nmore appropriate for constrained path navigation in Immersive Colonography and\nvalidated our conclusions with two radiologists. To this end, we asked 18\nparticipants to navigate inside a 3D colon to find specific marks. Our results\nsuggest that the Fly-Over technique may lead to enhanced lesion detection at\nthe cost of higher task completion times. Nevertheless, the Fly-Through method\nmay offer a more balanced trade-off between speed and effectiveness, whereas\nthe fixed camera orientation technique provided seemingly inferior performance\nresults.

    "abstract": "The gap between simulation and the real-world restrains many machine learning\nbreakthroughs in computer vision and reinforcement learning from being\napplicable in the real world. In this work, we tackle this gap for the specific\ncase of camera-based navigation, formulating it as following a visual cue in\nthe foreground with arbitrary backgrounds. The visual cue in the foreground can\noften be simulated realistically, such as a line, gate or cone. The challenge\nthen lies in coping with the unknown backgrounds and integrating both. As such,\nthe goal is to train a visual agent on data captured in an empty simulated\nenvironment except for this foreground cue and test this model directly in a\nvisually diverse real world. In order to bridge this big gap, we show it's\ncrucial to combine following techniques namely: Randomized augmentation of the\nfore- and background, regularization with both deep supervision and triplet\nloss and finally abstraction of the dynamics by using waypoints rather than\ndirect velocity commands. The various techniques are ablated in our\nexperimental results both qualitatively and quantitatively finally\ndemonstrating a successful transfer from simulation to the real world.",

    "abstract": "Automated monitoring of dark web (DW) platforms on a large scale is the first\nstep toward developing proactive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). While there\nare efficient methods for collecting data from the surface web, large-scale\ndark web data collection is often hindered by anti-crawling measures. In\nparticular, text-based CAPTCHA serves as the most prevalent and prohibiting\ntype of these measures in the dark web. Text-based CAPTCHA identifies and\nblocks automated crawlers by forcing the user to enter a combination of\nhard-to-recognize alphanumeric characters. In the dark web, CAPTCHA images are\nmeticulously designed with additional background noise and variable character\nlength to prevent automated CAPTCHA breaking. Existing automated CAPTCHA\nbreaking methods have difficulties in overcoming these dark web challenges. As\nsuch, solving dark web text-based CAPTCHA has been relying heavily on human\ninvolvement, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, we\npropose a novel framework for automated breaking of dark web CAPTCHA to\nfacilitate dark web data collection. This framework encompasses a novel\ngenerative method to recognize dark web text-based CAPTCHA with noisy\nbackground and variable character length. To eliminate the need for human\ninvolvement, the proposed framework utilizes Generative Adversarial Network\n(GAN) to counteract dark web background noise and leverages an enhanced\ncharacter segmentation algorithm to handle CAPTCHA images with variable\ncharacter length. Our proposed framework, DW-GAN, was systematically evaluated\non multiple dark web CAPTCHA testbeds. DW-GAN significantly outperformed the\nstate-of-the-art benchmark methods on all datasets, achieving over 94.4%\nsuccess rate on a carefully collected real-world dark web dataset...",

However, from\nour survey, there is still no research indicating the prior-fall activities,\nwhich we believe that they have a strong correlation with the intensity of the\nfall. The purpose of this research is to develop a fall alert system that also\nidentifies prior-fall activities. First, we want to find a suitable location to\nattach a sensor to the body. We created multiple-spot on-body devices to\ncollect various activity data. We used that dataset to train 5 different\nclassification models. We selected the XGBoost classification model for\ndetecting a prior-fall activity and the chest location for use in fall\ndetection from a comparison of the detection accuracy. We then tested 3\nexisting fall detection threshold algorithms to detect fall and fall to their\nknees first, and selected the 3-phase threshold algorithm of Chaitep and\nChawachat [3] in our system. From the experiment, we found that the fall\ndetection accuracy is 88.91%, the fall to their knees first detection accuracy\nis 91.25%, and the average accuracy of detection of prior-fall activities is\n86.25%. Although we use an activity dataset of young to middle-aged adults\n(18-49 years), we are confident that this system can be developed to monitor\nactivities before the fall, especially in the elderly, so that caretakers can\nbetter manage the situation.",

However, most work\ntries to detect anomalies on attributed networks only considering a single\ninteraction action, which cannot consider rich kinds of interaction actions in\nmulti-view attributed networks. In fact, it remains a challenging task to\nconsider all different kinds of interaction actions uniformly and detect\nanomalous instances in multi-view attributed networks. In this paper, we\npropose a Graph Convolution based framework, AnomMAN, to detect\n\\textbf{Anom}aly on \\textbf{M}ulti-view \\textbf{A}ttributed \\textbf{N}etworks.\nTo consider the attributes and all interaction actions jointly, we use the\nattention mechanism to define the importance of all views in networks.

Therefore, AnomMAN uses a\ngraph auto-encoder module to overcome the shortcoming and transform it to our\nstrength. According to experiments on real-world datasets, AnomMAN outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models and two variants of our proposed model.

In order to extract efficient fine-grained features\nand avoid tedious annotating work, this letter develops an unsupervised\nself-aligned network consisting of three branches. The network introduced a\nself-alignment module to convert the input images with variable orientations to\na uniform orientation, which is implemented under the constraint of triple loss\nfunction designed with spatial features. On this basis, spatial features,\nobtained by vertical and horizontal segmentation methods, and global features\nare integrated to improve the representation ability in embedded space.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on UAV-VeID dataset, and our method\nachieves the best performance compared with recent ReID works.",

These segmented mushrooms are then used as\ninput to a circular Hough transform for each mushroom detection including its\ncenter and radius. Once each mushroom's center position in the RGB image is\nknown, we then use the depth information to locate it in 3D space i.e. in world\ncoordinate system. In case of missing depth information at the detected center\nof each mushroom, we estimate from the nearest available depth information\nwithin the radius of each mushroom.

    "abstract": "Recently unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been widely deployed in various\nreal-world scenarios such as disaster rescue and package delivery. Many of\nthese working environments are unstructured with uncertain and dynamic\nobstacles. UAV collision frequently happens. An UAV with high agility is highly\ndesired to adjust its motions to adapt to these environmental dynamics.\nHowever, UAV agility is restricted by its battery power output; particularly,\nan UAV's power system cannot be aware of its actual power need in motion\nplanning while the need is dynamically changing as the environment and UAV\ncondition vary. It is difficult to accurately and timely align the power supply\nwith power needs in motion plannings. This mismatching will lead to an\ninsufficient power supply to an UAV and cause delayed motion adjustments,\nlargely increasing the risk of collisions with obstacles and therefore\nundermine UAV agility. To improve UAV agility, a novel intelligent power\nsolution, Agility-Enhanced Power Supply (AEPS), was developed to proactively\nprepare appropriate amount powers at the right timing to support motion\nplanning with enhanced agility. This method builds a bridge between the\nphysical power system and UAV planning. With agility-enhanced motion planning,\nthe safety of UAV in complex working environment will be enhanced. To evaluate\nAEPS effectiveness, missions of \"patrol missions for community security\" with\nunexpected obstacles were adopted; the power supply is realized by hybrid\nintegration of fuel cell, battery, and capacitor. The effectiveness of AEPS in\nimproving UAV agility was validated by the successful and timely power supply,\nimproved task success rate and system safety, and reduced mission duration.",

    "title": "A System-Level Framework for Analytical and Empirical Reliability  Exploration of STT-MRAM Caches",
    "abstract": "Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) is known as the most promising\nreplacement for SRAM technology in large Last-Level Caches (LLCs). Despite its\nhigh-density, non-volatility, near-zero leakage power, and immunity to\nradiation as the major advantages, STT-MRAM-based cache suffers from high error\nrates mainly due to retention failure, read disturbance, and write failure.\nExisting studies are limited to estimating the rate of only one or two of these\nerror types for STT-MRAM cache. However, the overall vulnerability of STT-MRAM\ncaches, which its estimation is a must to design cost-efficient reliable\ncaches, has not been offered in any of previous studies. In this paper, we\npropose a system-level framework for reliability exploration and\ncharacterization of errors behavior in STT-MRAM caches. To this end, we\nformulate the cache vulnerability considering the inter-correlation of the\nerror types including all three errors as well as the dependency of error rates\nto workloads behavior and Process Variations (PVs). Our analysis reveals that\nSTT-MRAM cache vulnerability is highly workload-dependent and varies by orders\nof magnitude in different cache access patterns. Our analytical study also\nshows that this vulnerability divergence significantly increases by process\nvariations in STT-MRAM cells. To evaluate the framework, we implement the error\ntypes in the gem5 full-system simulator, and the experimental results show that\nthe total error rate in a shared LLC varies by 32.0x for different workloads. A\nfurther 6.5x vulnerability variation is observed when considering PVs in the\nSTT-MRAM cells. In addition, the contribution of each error type in total LLC\nvulnerability highly varies in different cache access patterns and moreover,\nerror rates are differently affected by PVs.",

Machine learning algorithms helps the sell\nside community to identify such toxic patterns and eventually moderate such\ninputs. Yet, the extant literature provides fewer information about the\nsentiment of a prospective consumer on the perception of a product after being\nexposed to such toxic review content. In this study, we collect a balanced data\nset of review comments from 18 different players segregated into three\ndifferent sectors from google play-store.

Finally, we use\nstructural equation modelling to quantitatively study the influence of toxic\ncontent on overall product sentiment. We observe that comment toxicity\nnegatively influences overall product sentiment but do not exhibit a mediating\neffect over reviewer score to influence sector-wise relative rating.",

However, since weak supervision cannot distinguish the losses\ncaused by the detection and description steps, directly conducting weakly\nsupervised learning within a joint describe-then-detect pipeline suffers\nlimited performance. In this paper, we propose a decoupled describe-then-detect\npipeline tailored for weakly supervised local feature learning. Within our\npipeline, the detection step is decoupled from the description step and\npostponed until discriminative and robust descriptors are learned. In addition,\nwe introduce a line-to-window search strategy to explicitly use the camera pose\ninformation for better descriptor learning.

    "abstract": "Standard deep learning algorithms are implemented using floating-point real\nnumbers. This presents an obstacle for implementing them on low-end devices\nwhich may not have dedicated floating-point units (FPUs). As a result,\nresearchers in TinyML have considered machine learning algorithms that can\ntrain and run a deep neural network (DNN) on a low-end device using integer\noperations only. In this paper we propose PocketNN, a light and self-contained\nproof-of-concept framework in pure C++ for the training and inference of DNNs\nusing only integers. Unlike other approaches, PocketNN directly operates on\nintegers without requiring any explicit quantization algorithms or customized\nfixed-point formats. This was made possible by pocket activations, which are a\nfamily of activation functions devised for integer-only DNNs, and an emerging\nDNN training algorithm called direct feedback alignment (DFA). Unlike the\nstandard backpropagation (BP), DFA trains each layer independently, thus\navoiding integer overflow which is a key problem when using BP with\ninteger-only operations. We used PocketNN to train some DNNs on two well-known\ndatasets, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. Our experiments show that the DNNs trained\nwith our PocketNN achieved 96.98% and 87.7% accuracies on MNIST and\nFashion-MNIST datasets, respectively. The accuracies are very close to the\nequivalent DNNs trained using BP with floating-point real number operations,\nsuch that accuracy degradations were just 1.02%p and 2.09%p, respectively.\nFinally, our PocketNN has high compatibility and portability for low-end\ndevices as it is open source and implemented in pure C++ without any\ndependencies.",

Side channel analysis attacks take advantage from the fact that the\nbehavior of crypto implementations can be observed and provides hints that\nsimplify revealing keys. A new type of SCA are the so called horizontal SCAs.\nWell known randomization based countermeasures are effective means against\nvertical DPA attacks but they are not effective against horizontal DPA attacks.\nIn this paper we investigate how the formula used to implement the\nmultiplication of $GF(2^n)$-elements influences the results of horizontal DPA\nattacks against a Montgomery kP implementation. We implemented 5 designs with\ndifferent partial multipliers, i.e. based on different multiplication formulae.\nWe used two different technologies, i.e. a 130 and a 250 nm technology, to\nsimulate power traces for our analysis. We show that the implemented\nmultiplication formula influences the success of horizontal attacks\nsignificantly, but we also learned that its impact differs from technology to\ntechnology. Our analysis also reveals that the use of different multiplication\nformulae as the single countermeasure is not sufficient to protect\ncryptographic designs against horizontal DPA attacks.",

In large-scale experiments,\nhowever, UAV images suffer from containing a multitudinous amount of crops in a\ncomplex canopy architecture.

In this work,\nwe present a hands-on workflow for the automatized temporal and spatial\nidentification and individualization of crop images from UAVs abbreviated as\n\"cataloging\" based on comprehensible computer vision methods. We evaluate the\nworkflow on two real-world datasets. One dataset is recorded for observation of\nCercospora leaf spot - a fungal disease - in sugar beet over an entire growing\ncycle. The other one deals with harvest prediction of cauliflower plants. The\nplant catalog is utilized for the extraction of single plant images seen over\nmultiple time points. This gathers large-scale spatio-temporal image dataset\nthat in turn can be applied to train further machine learning models including\nvarious data layers. The presented approach improves analysis and\ninterpretation of UAV data in agriculture significantly.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) scheme\nwith an improved fractional-order extended state observer (IFO-ESO).Based on\nthe new ADRC scheme, the open-loop transfer function of a high-order system can\nbe approximately rendered to a so-called Weighed Bode's ideal transfer\nfunction, whose closed-loop performance is less prone to the controller\nparameter variations. The design of the IFO-ESO helps reduce the number of\nsystem states to be estimated and improves the performance of closed-loop\nsystem over %the previously proposed the fractional-order active disturbance\nrejection control (FO-ADRC) in the literature. Compared with the integer-order\nactive disturbance rejection controller (IO-ADRC) and FO-ADRC, the auxiliary\ntracking controller of IFO-ADRC has a simpler form. Frequency-domain analysis\nshows that IFO-ESO has better estimation performance than fractional-order ESO,\nand time-domain simulation demonstrates that the proposed ADRC has better\ntransient performance and is more robust against the parameter variations than\nFO-ADRC and IO-ADRC. The proposed ADRC is applied to permanent magnet\nsynchronous motor (PMSM) servo control system and demonstrates its capability\nin a real-world application.",

    "abstract": "Attention-based deep networks have been successfully applied on textual data\nin the field of NLP. However, their application on protein sequences poses\nadditional challenges due to the weak semantics of the protein words, unlike\nthe plain text words. These unexplored challenges faced by the standard\nattention technique include (i) vanishing attention score problem and (ii) high\nvariations in the attention distribution. In this regard, we introduce a novel\n{\\lambda}-scaled attention technique for fast and efficient modeling of the\nprotein sequences that addresses both the above problems. This is used to\ndevelop the {\\lambda}-scaled attention network and is evaluated for the task of\nprotein function prediction implemented at the protein sub-sequence level.\nExperiments on the datasets for biological process (BP) and molecular function\n(MF) showed significant improvements in the F1 score values for the proposed\n{\\lambda}-scaled attention technique over its counterpart approach based on the\nstandard attention technique (+2.01% for BP and +4.67% for MF) and\nstate-of-the-art ProtVecGen-Plus approach (+2.61% for BP and +4.20% for MF).\nFurther, fast convergence (converging in half the number of epochs) and\nefficient learning (in terms of very low difference between the training and\nvalidation losses) were also observed during the training process.",

    "abstract": "We consider in this paper a new intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided\nLEO satellite communication system, by utilizing the controllable phase shifts\nof massive passive reflecting elements to achieve flexible beamforming, which\ncopes with the time-varying channel between the high-mobility satellite (SAT)\nand ground node (GN) cost-effectively. In particular, we propose a new\narchitecture for IRS-aided LEO satellite communication where IRSs are deployed\nat both sides of the SAT and GN, and study their cooperative passive\nbeamforming (CPB) design over line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant single-reflection\nand double-reflection channels. Specifically, we jointly optimize the active\ntransmit/receive beamforming at the SAT/GN as well as the CPB at two-sided IRSs\nto maximize the overall channel gain from the SAT to each GN. Interestingly, we\nshow that under LoS channel conditions, the high-dimensional SAT-GN channel can\nbe decomposed into the outer product of two low-dimensional vectors. By\nexploiting the decomposed SAT-GN channel, we decouple the original beamforming\noptimization problem into two simpler subproblems corresponding to the SAT and\nGN sides, respectively, which are both solved in closed-form. Furthermore, we\npropose an efficient transmission protocol to conduct channel estimation and\nbeam tracking, which only requires independent processing of the SAT and GN in\na distributed manner, thus substantially reducing the implementation\ncomplexity.

    "abstract": "We introduce a natural {\\em knapsack intersection hierarchy} for\nstrengthening linear programming relaxations of packing integer programs, i.e.,\n$\\max\\{w^Tx:x\\in P\\cap\\{0,1\\}^n\\}$ where $P=\\{x\\in[0,1]^n:Ax \\leq b\\}$ and\n$A,b,w\\ge0$. The $t^{th}$ level $P^{t}$ corresponds to adding cuts associated\nwith the integer hull of the intersection of any $t$ knapsack constraints (rows\nof the constraint matrix). This model captures the maximum possible strength of\n\"$t$-row cuts\", an approach often used by solvers for small $t$. If $A$ is $m\n\\times n$, then $P^m$ is the integer hull of $P$ and $P^1$ corresponds to\nadding cuts for each associated single-row knapsack problem. Thus, even\nseparating over $P^1$ is NP-hard. However, for fixed $t$ and any $\\epsilon>0$,\nresults of Pritchard imply there is a polytime $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation for\n$P^{t}$. We then investigate the hierarchy's strength in the context of the\nwell-studied all-or-nothing flow problem in trees (also called unsplittable\nflow on trees). For this problem, we show that the integrality gap of $P^t$ is\n$O(n/t)$ and give examples where the gap is $\\Omega(n/t)$. We then examine the\nstronger formulation $P_{\\text{rank}}$ where all rank constraints are added.\nFor $P_{\\text{rank}}^t$, our best lower bound drops to $\\Omega(1/c)$ at level\n$t=n^c$ for any $c>0$. Moreover, on a well-known class of \"bad instances\" due\nto Friggstad and Gao, we show that we can achieve this gap; hence a constant\nintegrality gap for these instances is obtained at level $n^c$.",

Combining others factors, Phocus classifies citations\ncoarsely, ranks all references within a paper, and utilizes the results of the\nclassifier and the ranking model to get the local influential factor of a\nreference to the citing paper.

Both the forward and feedback channels are\nsubject to random transmission times. We optimize the sampling strategy at the\nsource (e.g., a sensor), aiming to enhance the freshness of data samples\ndelivered to the destination (e.g., an estimator). This sampling problem is\nmotivated by a distributed sensing system, where an estimator estimates a\nsignal by combining noisy signal observations collected from a local sensor and\naccurate signal samples received from a remote sensor. We show that the optimal\nestimation error is an increasing function of the age of received signal\nsamples. The optimal sampling problem for general non-decreasing age functions\nis formulated as an MDP with an uncountable state space. An exact solution to\nthis problem is derived, which has a simple threshold-type structure. The\nthreshold can be calculated by low-complexity bisection search and fixed-point\niterations.

    "abstract": "Most Gaze estimation research only works on a setup condition that a camera\nperfectly captures eyes gaze. They have not literarily specified how to set up\na camera correctly for a given position of a person. In this paper, we carry\nout a study on gaze estimation with a logical camera setup position. We further\nbring our research in a practical application by using inexpensive edge devices\nwith a realistic scenario. That is, we first set up a shopping environment\nwhere we want to grasp customers gazing behaviors. This setup needs an optimal\ncamera position in order to maintain estimation accuracy from existing gaze\nestimation research. We then apply the state-of-the-art of few-shot learning\ngaze estimation to reduce training sampling in the inference phase. In the\nexperiment, we perform our implemented research on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and\nachieve a reasonable speed, 12 FPS which is faster compared with our reference\nwork, without much degradation of gaze estimation accuracy.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new method for camera-model identification. Our approach\ncombines two independent aspects of video file generation corresponding to\nvideo coding and media data encapsulation. To this end, a joint representation\nof the overall file metadata is developed and used in conjunction with a\ntwo-level hierarchical classification method. At the first level, our method\ngroups videos into metaclasses considering several abstractions that represent\nhigh-level structural properties of file metadata. This is followed by a more\nnuanced classification of classes that comprise each metaclass. The method is\nevaluated on more than 20K videos obtained by combining four public video\ndatasets. Tests show that a balanced accuracy of 91% is achieved in correctly\nidentifying the class of a video among 119 video classes. This corresponds to\nan improvement of 6.5% over the conventional approach based on video file\nencapsulation characteristics. Furthermore, we investigate a setting relevant\nto forensic file recovery operations where file metadata cannot be located or\nare missing but video data is partially available. By estimating a partial list\nof encoding parameters from coded video data, we demonstrate that an\nidentification accuracy of 57% can be achieved in camera-model identification\nin the absence of any other file metadata.",

Highly Reliable Agent Designs (HRAD) is one of\nthe most controversial and ambitious approaches, championed by the Machine\nIntelligence Research Institute, among others, and various arguments have been\nmade about whether and how it reduces risks from future AI systems. In order to\nreduce confusion in the debate about AI safety, here we build on a previous\ndiscussion by Rice which collects and presents four central arguments which are\nused to justify HRAD as a path towards safety of AI systems.\nWe have titled the arguments (1) incidental utility,(2) deconfusion, (3)\nprecise specification, and (4) prediction. Each of these makes different,\npartly conflicting claims about how future AI systems can be risky. We have\nexplained the assumptions and claims based on a review of published and\ninformal literature, along with consultation with experts who have stated\npositions on the topic. Finally, we have briefly outlined arguments against\neach approach and against the agenda overall.",

While existing weakly supervised methods can effectively learn\nsemantics with only a small fraction of point-level annotations, we find that\nthe vanilla bounding box-level annotation is also informative for semantic\nsegmentation of large-scale 3D point clouds. In this paper, we introduce a\nneural architecture, termed Box2Seg, to learn point-level semantics of 3D point\nclouds with bounding box-level supervision. The key to our approach is to\ngenerate accurate pseudo labels by exploring the geometric and topological\nstructure inside and outside each bounding box. Specifically, an\nattention-based self-training (AST) technique and Point Class Activation\nMapping (PCAM) are utilized to estimate pseudo-labels. The network is further\ntrained and refined with pseudo labels. Experiments on two large-scale\nbenchmarks including S3DIS and ScanNet demonstrate the competitive performance\nof the proposed method.

    "abstract": "Recently, the applications of deep neural network (DNN) have been very\nprominent in many fields such as computer vision (CV) and natural language\nprocessing (NLP) due to its superior feature extraction performance. However,\nthe high-dimension parameter model and large-scale mathematical calculation\nrestrict the execution efficiency, especially for Internet of Things (IoT)\ndevices. Different from the previous cloud/edge-only pattern that brings huge\npressure for uplink communication and device-only fashion that undertakes\nunaffordable calculation strength, we highlight the collaborative computation\nbetween the device and edge for DNN models, which can achieve a good balance\nbetween the communication load and execution accuracy.

We tackle\nthis problem from the viewpoint of a control interface that makes routing\nrecommendations based solely on observed costs and without any further\nknowledge of the system's governing dynamics -- such as the network's cost\nfunctions, the distribution of any random events affecting the network, etc. In\nthis online setting, learning methods based on the popular exponential weights\nalgorithm converge to equilibrium at an $\\mathcal{O}({1/\\sqrt{T}})$ rate: this\nrate is known to be order-optimal in stochastic networks, but it is otherwise\nsuboptimal in static networks.

The most\nthreatening backdoor attack is the stealthy backdoor, which defines the\ntriggers as text style or syntactic. Although they have achieved an incredible\nhigh attack success rate (ASR), we find that the principal factor contributing\nto their ASR is not the `backdoor trigger' paradigm. Thus the capacity of these\nstealthy backdoor attacks is overestimated when categorized as backdoor\nattacks. Therefore, to evaluate the real attack power of backdoor attacks, we\npropose a new metric called attack successful rate difference (ASRD), which\nmeasures the ASR difference between clean state and poison state models.\nBesides, since the defenses against stealthy backdoor attacks are absent, we\npropose Trigger Breaker, consisting of two too simple tricks that can defend\nagainst stealthy backdoor attacks effectively.

    "abstract": "Speaker recognition systems are widely used in various applications to\nidentify a person by their voice; however, the high degree of variability in\nspeech signals makes this a challenging task. Dealing with emotional variations\nis very difficult because emotions alter the voice characteristics of a person;\nthus, the acoustic features differ from those used to train models in a neutral\nenvironment. Therefore, speaker recognition models trained on neutral speech\nfail to correctly identify speakers under emotional stress. Although\nconsiderable advancements in speaker identification have been made using\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN), CNNs cannot exploit the spatial\nassociation between low-level features. Inspired by the recent introduction of\ncapsule networks (CapsNets), which are based on deep learning to overcome the\ninadequacy of CNNs in preserving the pose relationship between low-level\nfeatures with their pooling technique, this study investigates the performance\nof using CapsNets in identifying speakers from emotional speech recordings. A\nCapsNet-based speaker identification model is proposed and evaluated using\nthree distinct speech databases, i.e., the Emirati Speech Database, SUSAS\nDataset, and RAVDESS (open-access). The proposed model is also compared to\nbaseline systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the novel proposed\nCapsNet model trains faster and provides better results over current\nstate-of-the-art schemes. The effect of the routing algorithm on speaker\nidentification performance was also studied by varying the number of\niterations, both with and without a decoder network.",

Few studies have investigated\nwhether readers can make accurate quantitative assessments using contiguous\narea cartograms. Therefore, we conducted an experiment to determine the\naccuracy, speed, and confidence with which readers infer numerical data values\nfor the mapped regions. We investigated whether including an area-to-value\nlegend (in the form of a square symbol next to the value represented by the\nsquare's area) makes it easier for map readers to estimate magnitudes. We also\nevaluated the effectiveness of two additional features: grid lines and an\ninteractive area-to-value legend that allows participants to select the value\nrepresented by the square. Without any legends and only informed about the\ntotal numerical value represented by the whole cartogram, the distribution of\nestimates for individual regions was centered near the true value with\nsubstantial spread. Selectable legends with grid lines significantly reduced\nthe spread but led to a tendency to underestimate the values. When comparing\ndifferences between regions or between cartograms, legends and grid lines made\nestimation slower but not more accurate. However, legends and grid lines made\nit more likely that participants completed the tasks. We recommend considering\nthe cartogram's use case and purpose before deciding whether to include grid\nlines or an interactive legend.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a rigorous analysis of the adverse effects of\ncyber-physical attacks on the performance of multi-agent consensus with\nevent-triggered control protocols. It is shown how a strategic malicious attack\non sensors and actuators can deceive the triggering condition of both\nstate-based event-triggered mechanism and combinational state-based\nevent-triggered mechanism, which are commonplace and widely used in the\nliterature. More precisely, it is first shown that a deception attack in the\ncase of combinational state-based event-triggered mechanism can result in a\nnon-triggering misbehavior, in the sense that the compromised agent does not\ntrigger any event and consequently results in partial feedback disconnectivity\nby preventing information from reaching the local neighbors of the compromised\nagent. This indicates that the combinational state-based event-triggered\nmechanism can be leveraged by the attacker to harm the network connectivity by\nrendering the recent data unavailable to agents. It is then shown that the\ndeception attack in the case of state-based event-triggered mechanism can\nresult in a continuous-triggering misbehavior in the sense that the\nevent-triggered mechanism continuously generates triggering events resulting in\nundesirable phenomenon of Zeno behavior. Finally, numerical simulations are\npresented to illustrate the theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "Early detection of COVID-19 is an ongoing area of research that can help with\ntriage, monitoring and general health assessment of potential patients and may\nreduce operational strain on hospitals that cope with the coronavirus pandemic.\nDifferent machine learning techniques have been used in the literature to\ndetect coronavirus using routine clinical data (blood tests, and vital signs).\nData breaches and information leakage when using these models can bring\nreputational damage and cause legal issues for hospitals. In spite of this,\nprotecting healthcare models against leakage of potentially sensitive\ninformation is an understudied research area.

One way of circumventing these\nrestrictions is to anonymize the event log to the extent that no individual can\nbe singled out using the anonymized log. This article addresses the problem of\nanonymizing an event log in order to guarantee that, upon release of the\nanonymized log, the probability that an attacker may single out any individual\nrepresented in the original log does not increase by more than a threshold. The\narticle proposes a differentially private release mechanism, which samples the\ncases in the log and adds noise to the timestamps to the extent required to\nachieve the above privacy guarantee.

    "abstract": "With the continuous development of neural networks in computer vision tasks,\nmore and more network architectures have achieved outstanding success. As one\nof the most advanced neural network architectures, DenseNet shortcuts all\nfeature maps to solve the problem of model depth. Although this network\narchitecture has excellent accuracy at low MACs (multiplications and\naccumulations), it takes excessive inference time. To solve this problem,\nHarDNet reduces the connections between feature maps, making the remaining\nconnections resemble harmonic waves. However, this compression method may\nresult in decreasing model accuracy and increasing MACs and model size. This\nnetwork architecture only reduces the memory access time, its overall\nperformance still needs to be improved. Therefore, we propose a new network\narchitecture using threshold mechanism to further optimize the method of\nconnections. Different numbers of connections for different convolutional\nlayers are discarded to compress the feature maps in ThreshNet. The proposed\nnetwork architecture used three datasets, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, to\nevaluate the performance for image classifications. Experimental results show\nthat ThreshNet achieves up to 60% reduction in inference time compared to\nDenseNet, and up to 35% faster training speed and 20% reduction in error rate\ncompared to HarDNet on these datasets.",

    "abstract": "Spatial redundancy widely exists in visual recognition tasks, i.e.,\ndiscriminative features in an image or video frame usually correspond to only a\nsubset of pixels, while the remaining regions are irrelevant to the task at\nhand. Therefore, static models which process all the pixels with an equal\namount of computation result in considerable redundancy in terms of time and\nspace consumption. In this paper, we formulate the image recognition problem as\na sequential coarse-to-fine feature learning process, mimicking the human\nvisual system. Specifically, the proposed Glance and Focus Network (GFNet)\nfirst extracts a quick global representation of the input image at a low\nresolution scale, and then strategically attends to a series of salient (small)\nregions to learn finer features. The sequential process naturally facilitates\nadaptive inference at test time, as it can be terminated once the model is\nsufficiently confident about its prediction, avoiding further redundant\ncomputation. It is worth noting that the problem of locating discriminant\nregions in our model is formulated as a reinforcement learning task, thus\nrequiring no additional manual annotations other than classification labels.\nGFNet is general and flexible as it is compatible with any off-the-shelf\nbackbone models (such as MobileNets, EfficientNets and TSM), which can be\nconveniently deployed as the feature extractor. Extensive experiments on a\nvariety of image classification and video recognition tasks and with various\nbackbone models demonstrate the remarkable efficiency of our method. For\nexample, it reduces the average latency of the highly efficient MobileNet-V3 on\nan iPhone XS Max by 1.3x without sacrificing accuracy.

To this end, our framework\nconsists of three main parts: 1) a completion network to capture holistic\nsemantics of point clouds; 2) a pose regression network to understand the\nviewing angle where partial data is scanned from; 3) a partial reconstruction\nnetwork to encourage the model to learn content and pose features. To\ndemonstrate the robustness of the learnt feature representations, we conduct\nseveral downstream tasks including classification, part segmentation, and\nregistration, with comparisons against state-of-the-art methods.

Existing works use a validation set to monitor the\naccuracy of the student over real data and report the highest performance\nthroughout the entire process. However, validation data may not be available at\ndistillation time either, making it infeasible to record the student snapshot\nthat achieved the peak accuracy. Therefore, a practical data-free KD method\nshould be robust and ideally provide monotonically increasing student accuracy\nduring distillation. This is challenging because the student experiences\nknowledge degradation due to the distribution shift of the synthetic data. A\nstraightforward approach to overcome this issue is to store and rehearse the\ngenerated samples periodically, which increases the memory footprint and\ncreates privacy concerns. We propose to model the distribution of the\npreviously observed synthetic samples with a generative network. In particular,\nwe design a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a training objective that is\ncustomized to learn the synthetic data representations optimally. The student\nis rehearsed by the generative pseudo replay technique, with samples produced\nby the VAE. Hence knowledge degradation can be prevented without storing any\nsamples.

In this regard, initially, a side-lit shoebox\nmodel with variable parameters was modeled parametrically, and five common\nsolar shading models with their variables were applied to the space. For each\nsolar shadings and the state without shading, metrics related to daylight and\nglare, view, and initial costs were simulated.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Virtual Reality (VR) Head-Mounted Displays (HMD) have been\nused to provide an immersive, first-person view in real-time for the\nremote-control of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV). One critical issue is that it\nis challenging to perceive the distance of obstacles surrounding the vehicle\nfrom 2D views in the HMD, which deteriorates the control of UGV. Conventional\ndistance indicators used in HMD take up screen space which leads clutter on the\ndisplay and can further reduce situation awareness of the physical environment.\nTo address the issue, in this paper we propose off-screen in-device feedback\nusing vibro-tactile and/or light-visual cues to provide real-time distance\ninformation for the remote control of UGV. Results from a study show a\nsignificantly better performance with either feedback type, reduced workload\nand improved usability in a driving task that requires continuous perception of\nthe distance between the UGV and its environmental objects or obstacles. Our\nfindings show a solid case for in-device vibro-tactile and/or light-visual\nfeedback to support remote operation of UGVs that highly relies on distance\nperception of objects.",

    "abstract": "Extremely large-scale array (XL-array) communications correspond to systems\nwhose antenna sizes are so large that the scatterers and/or users may no longer\nbe located in the far-field region. By discarding the conventional far-field\nuniform plane wave (UPW) assumption, this letter studies the near-field spatial\ncorrelation of XL-array communications, by taking into account the more generic\nnon-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) characteristics. It is revealed that\ndifferent from the far-field channel spatial correlation which only depends on\nthe power angular spectrum (PAS), the near-field spatial correlation depends on\nthe scattered power distribution not just characterized by their arriving\nangles, but also by the scatterers' distances, which is termed as power\nlocation spectrum (PLS). A novel integral expression is derived for the\nnear-field spatial correlation in terms of the scatterers' location\ndistribution, which includes the far-field spatial correlation as a special\ncase. The result shows that different from the far-field case, the near-field\nspatial correlation no longer exhibits spatial stationarity in general, since\nthe correlation coefficient for each pair of antennas depends on their specific\npositions, rather than their relative distance only. To gain further insights,\nwe propose a generalized one-ring model for scatterer distribution, by allowing\nthe ring center to be flexibly located rather than coinciding with the array\ncenter as in the conventional one-ring model. Numerical results are provided to\nshow the necessity of the near-field spatial correlation modelling for XL-array\ncommunications.",

To solve this kind of\nproblems, we introduce and study a new type of hash functions for finding\nshifts in sublinear time.

Using such an algorithm of Dinur et al.\n(Crypto 2018), we get LPHS with near-optimal error of $\\delta=\\tilde O(1/d^2)$.\nThis gives an unusual example for the usefulness of group-based cryptography in\na post-quantum world.

In particular, we apply\nmultidimensional LPHS to obtain an efficient \"packed\" implementation of\nhomomorphic secret sharing and a sublinear-time implementation of\nlocation-sensitive encryption whose decryption requires a significantly\noverlapping view.",

This paper evaluates existing facial image datasets and\nproposes a new dataset tailored to the needs of similar digital forensic\nresearch contributions. This small, diverse dataset of 0 to 20-year-old\nindividuals contains 245 images and is merged with 82 unique images from the\nFG-NET dataset, thus achieving a total of 327 images with high image diversity\nand low age range density.

The overall results for\nyoung adolescents aged 10 to 15 and older adolescents/adults aged 16 to 20 are\nvery encouraging -- achieving MAEs as low as 1.79, but also suggest that the\naccuracy for children aged 0 to 10 needs further work. In order to determine\nthe efficacy of the prototype, valuable input of four digital forensic experts,\nincluding two forensic investigators, has been taken into account to improve\nage estimation results. Further research is required to extend datasets both\nconcerning image density and the equal distribution of factors such as gender\nand racial diversity.",

Despite the convenience offered by\nM-Banking Apps, users are often distrustful of the security of the applications\ndue to an increasing trend of cyber security compromises, cyber-attacks, and\ndata breaches. Considering the upsurge in cyber security vulnerabilities of\nM-Banking Apps and the paucity of research in this domain, this study was\nconducted to empirically measure user-perceived security of M-Banking Apps. A\ntotal of 315 responses from study participants were analysed using\ncovariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM). The results indicated\nthat most constructs of the baseline Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and\nUse of Technology (UTAUT2) structure were validated. Perceived security,\ninstitutional trust and technology trust were confirmed as factors that affect\nuser's intention to adopt and use M-Banking Apps. However, perceived risk was\nnot confirmed as a significant predictor. The current study further revealed\nthat in the context of M-Banking Apps, the effects of security and trust are\ncomplex. The impact of perceived security and institutional trust on\nbehavioural intention was moderated by age, gender, experience, income, and\neducation, while perceived security on use behaviour was moderated by age,\ngender, and experience. The effect of technology trust on behavioural intention\nwas moderated by age, education, and experience. Overall, the proposed\nconceptual model achieved acceptable fit and explained 79% of the variance in\nbehavioural intention and 54.7% in use behaviour of M-Banking Apps, higher than\nthat obtained in the original UTAUT2. The guarantee of enhanced security,\nadvanced privacy mechanisms and trust should be considered paramount in future\nstrategies aimed at promoting M-Banking Apps adoption and use.",

    "abstract": "We study generalization bounds for noisy stochastic mini-batch iterative\nalgorithms based on the notion of stability. Recent years have seen key\nadvances in data-dependent generalization bounds for noisy iterative learning\nalgorithms such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) based on\nstability (Mou et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020) and information theoretic\napproaches (Xu and Raginsky, 2017; Negrea et al., 2019; Steinke and\nZakynthinou, 2020; Haghifam et al., 2020). In this paper, we unify and\nsubstantially generalize stability based generalization bounds and make three\ntechnical advances. First, we bound the generalization error of general noisy\nstochastic iterative algorithms (not necessarily gradient descent) in terms of\nexpected (not uniform) stability. The expected stability can in turn be bounded\nby a Le Cam Style Divergence. Such bounds have a O(1/n) sample dependence\nunlike many existing bounds with O(1/\\sqrt{n}) dependence. Second, we introduce\nExponential Family Langevin Dynamics(EFLD) which is a substantial\ngeneralization of SGLD and which allows exponential family noise to be used\nwith stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We establish data-dependent expected\nstability based generalization bounds for general EFLD algorithms. Third, we\nconsider an important special case of EFLD: noisy sign-SGD, which extends\nsign-SGD using Bernoulli noise over {-1,+1}. Generalization bounds for noisy\nsign-SGD are implied by that of EFLD and we also establish optimization\nguarantees for the algorithm. Further, we present empirical results on\nbenchmark datasets to illustrate that our bounds are non-vacuous and\nquantitatively much sharper than existing bounds.",

We find two types of biases in gender,\npreference-based bias and belief-based bias, are present in human evaluators'\ndecisions. Both types of biases are in favor of female applicants. Through\ncounterfactual simulations, we quantify the effect of gender bias on loan\ngranting outcomes and the welfare of the company and the borrowers. Our results\nimply that both the existence of the preference-based bias and that of the\nbelief-based bias reduce the company's profits. When the preference-based bias\nis removed, the company earns more profits. When the belief-based bias is\nremoved, the company's profits also increase. Both increases result from\nraising the approval probability for borrowers, especially male borrowers, who\neventually pay back loans. For borrowers, the elimination of either bias\ndecreases the gender gap of the true positive rates in the credit risk\nevaluation. We also train machine learning algorithms on both the real-world\ndata and the data from the counterfactual simulations. We compare the decisions\nmade by those algorithms to see how evaluators' biases are inherited by the\nalgorithms and reflected in machine-based decisions. We find that machine\nlearning algorithms can mitigate both the preference-based bias and the\nbelief-based bias.",

    "abstract": "Main subjects usually exist in the images or videos, as they are the objects\nthat the photographer wants to highlight. Human viewers can easily identify\nthem but algorithms often confuse them with other objects. Detecting the main\nsubjects is an important technique to help machines understand the content of\nimages and videos. We present a new dataset with the goal of training models to\nunderstand the layout of the objects and the context of the image then to find\nthe main subjects among them. This is achieved in three aspects. By gathering\nimages from movie shots created by directors with professional shooting skills,\nwe collect the dataset with strong diversity, specifically, it contains\n107\\,700 images from 21\\,540 movie shots. We labeled them with the bounding box\nlabels for two classes: subject and non-subject foreground object. We present a\ndetailed analysis of the dataset and compare the task with saliency detection\nand object detection. ImageSubject is the first dataset that tries to localize\nthe subject in an image that the photographer wants to highlight. Moreover, we\nfind the transformer-based detection model offers the best result among other\npopular model architectures. Finally, we discuss the potential applications and\nconclude with the importance of the dataset.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in unsupervised domain adaptation have shown that mitigating\nthe domain divergence by extracting the domain-invariant representation could\nsignificantly improve the generalization of a model to an unlabeled data\ndomain. Nevertheless, the existing methods fail to effectively preserve the\nrepresentation that is private to the label-missing domain, which could\nadversely affect the generalization. In this paper, we propose an approach to\npreserve such representation so that the latent distribution of the unlabeled\ndomain could represent both the domain-invariant features and the individual\ncharacteristics that are private to the unlabeled domain. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that maximizing the mutual information between the unlabeled domain\nand its latent space while mitigating the domain divergence can achieve such\npreservation. We also theoretically and empirically validate that preserving\nthe representation that is private to the unlabeled domain is important and of\nnecessity for the cross-domain generalization. Our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on several public datasets.",

    "abstract": "Achieving universal translation between all human language pairs is the\nholy-grail of machine translation (MT) research. While recent progress in\nmassively multilingual MT is one step closer to reaching this goal, it is\nbecoming evident that extending a multilingual MT system simply by training on\nmore parallel data is unscalable, since the availability of labeled data for\nlow-resource and non-English-centric language pairs is forbiddingly limited. To\nthis end, we present a pragmatic approach towards building a multilingual MT\nmodel that covers hundreds of languages, using a mixture of supervised and\nself-supervised objectives, depending on the data availability for different\nlanguage pairs. We demonstrate that the synergy between these two training\nparadigms enables the model to produce high-quality translations in the\nzero-resource setting, even surpassing supervised translation quality for low-\nand mid-resource languages. We conduct a wide array of experiments to\nunderstand the effect of the degree of multilingual supervision, domain\nmismatches and amounts of parallel and monolingual data on the quality of our\nself-supervised multilingual models. To demonstrate the scalability of the\napproach, we train models with over 200 languages and demonstrate high\nperformance on zero-resource translation on several previously under-studied\nlanguages. We hope our findings will serve as a stepping stone towards enabling\ntranslation for the next thousand languages.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that translations of songs and poems not only breaks rhythm\nand rhyming patterns, but also results in loss of semantic information. The\nBhagavad Gita is an ancient Hindu philosophical text originally written in\nSanskrit that features a conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna prior to\nthe Mahabharata war. The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the key sacred texts in\nHinduism and known as the forefront of the Vedic corpus of Hinduism. In the\nlast two centuries, there has been a lot of interest in Hindu philosophy by\nwestern scholars and hence the Bhagavad Gita has been translated in a number of\nlanguages. However, there is not much work that validates the quality of the\nEnglish translations. Recent progress of language models powered by deep\nlearning has enabled not only translations but better understanding of language\nand texts with semantic and sentiment analysis. Our work is motivated by the\nrecent progress of language models powered by deep learning methods. In this\npaper, we compare selected translations (mostly from Sanskrit to English) of\nthe Bhagavad Gita using semantic and sentiment analyses. We use hand-labelled\nsentiment dataset for tuning state-of-art deep learning-based language model\nknown as \\textit{bidirectional encoder representations from transformers}\n(BERT). We use novel sentence embedding models to provide semantic analysis for\nselected chapters and verses across translations. Finally, we use the\naforementioned models for sentiment and semantic analyses and provide\nvisualisation of results. Our results show that although the style and\nvocabulary in the respective Bhagavad Gita translations vary widely, the\nsentiment analysis and semantic similarity shows that the message conveyed are\nmostly similar across the translations.",

    "abstract": "Driven by the key challenges of cell therapy manufacturing, including high\ncomplexity, high uncertainty, and very limited process data, we propose a\nstochastic optimization framework named \"hybrid-RL\" to efficiently guide\nprocess development and control. We first create the bioprocess probabilistic\nknowledge graph that is a hybrid model characterizing the understanding of\nbiomanufacturing process mechanisms and quantifying inherent stochasticity,\nsuch as batch-to-batch variation and bioprocess noise. It can capture the key\nfeatures, including nonlinear reactions, time-varying kinetics, and partially\nobserved bioprocess state. This hybrid model can leverage on existing\nmechanistic models and facilitate the learning from process data. Given limited\nprocess data, a computational sampling approach is used to generate posterior\nsamples quantifying the model estimation uncertainty. Then, we introduce hybrid\nmodel-based Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL), accounting for both inherent\nstochasticity and model uncertainty, to guide optimal, robust, and\ninterpretable decision making, which can overcome the key challenges of cell\ntherapy manufacturing. In the empirical study, cell therapy manufacturing\nexamples are used to demonstrate that the proposed hybrid-RL framework can\noutperform the classical deterministic mechanistic model assisted process\noptimization.",

The problem of deletion to $\\Pi$,\ntakes as input a graph $G$ and asks for a minimum number (or a fixed integer\n$k$) of vertices to be deleted from $G$ so that the resulting graph belongs to\n$\\Pi$. This is a well-studied problem in paradigms including approximation and\nparameterized complexity. Recently, the study of a natural extension of the\nproblem was initiated where we are given a finite set of hereditary graph\nclasses, and the goal is to determine whether $k$ vertices can be deleted from\na given graph so that the connected components of the resulting graph belong to\none of the given hereditary graph classes. The problem is shown to be FPT as\nlong as the deletion problem to each of the given hereditary graph classes is\nfixed-parameter tractable, and the property of being in any of the graph\nclasses is expressible in the counting monodic second order (CMSO) logic. While\nthis was shown using some black box theorems, faster algorithms were shown when\neach of the hereditary graph classes has a finite forbidden set. In this paper,\nwe do a deep dive on pairs of specific graph classes ($\\Pi_1, \\Pi_2$) in which\nwe would like the connected components of the resulting graph to belong to, and\ndesign simpler and more efficient FPT algorithms. We design a general FPT\nalgorithm and approximation algorithm for pairs of graph classes (possibly\nhaving infinite forbidden sets) satisfying certain conditions. These algorithms\ncover several pairs of popular graph classes. Our algorithm makes non-trivial\nuse of the branching technique and as a black box, FPT algorithms for deletion\nto individual graph classes.",

However, its representations is very\nsusceptible to the noise of interaction. In response to this problem, SGL\nexplored the self-supervised learning on the user-item graph to improve the\nrobustness of GCN. Although effective, we found that SGL directly applies\nSimCLR's comparative learning framework. This framework may not be directly\napplicable to the scenario of the recommendation system, and does not fully\nconsider the uncertainty of user-item interaction.In this work, we aim to\nconsider the application of contrastive learning in the scenario of the\nrecommendation system adequately, making it more suitable for recommendation\ntask. We propose a supervised contrastive learning framework to pre-train the\nuser-item bipartite graph, and then fine-tune the graph convolutional neural\nnetwork. Specifically, we will compare the similarity between users and items\nduring data preprocessing, and then when applying contrastive learning, not\nonly will the augmented views be regarded as the positive samples, but also a\ncertain number of similar samples will be regarded as the positive samples,\nwhich is different from SimCLR who treats other samples in a batch as negative\nsamples.

    "abstract": "During Australia's unprecedented bushfires in 2019-2020, misinformation\nblaming arson resurfaced on Twitter using #ArsonEmergency. The extent to which\nbots were responsible for disseminating and amplifying this misinformation has\nreceived scrutiny in the media and academic research. Here we study Twitter\ncommunities spreading this misinformation during the population-level event,\nand investigate the role of online communities and bots. Our in-depth\ninvestigation of the dynamics of the discussion uses a phased approach --\nbefore and after reporting of bots promoting the hashtag was broadcast by the\nmainstream media. Though we did not find many bots, the most bot-like accounts\nwere social bots, which present as genuine humans. Further, we distilled\nmeaningful quantitative differences between two polarised communities in the\nTwitter discussion, resulting in the following insights. First, Supporters of\nthe arson narrative promoted misinformation by engaging others directly with\nreplies and mentions using hashtags and links to external sources. In response,\nOpposers retweeted fact-based articles and official information. Second,\nSupporters were embedded throughout their interaction networks, but Opposers\nobtained high centrality more efficiently despite their peripheral positions.\nBy the last phase, Opposers and unaffiliated accounts appeared to coordinate,\npotentially reaching a broader audience. Finally, unaffiliated accounts shared\nthe same URLs as Opposers over Supporters by a ratio of 9:1 in the last phase,\nhaving shared mostly Supporter URLs in the first phase. This foiled Supporters'\nefforts, highlighting the value of exposing misinformation campaigns. We\nspeculate that the communication strategies observed here could be discoverable\nin other misinformation-related discussions and could inform\ncounter-strategies.",

    "abstract": "As the deep learning techniques have expanded to real-world recommendation\ntasks, many deep neural network based Collaborative Filtering (CF) models have\nbeen developed to project user-item interactions into latent feature space,\nbased on various neural architectures, such as multi-layer perceptron,\nauto-encoder and graph neural networks. However, the majority of existing\ncollaborative filtering systems are not well designed to handle missing data.\nParticularly, in order to inject the negative signals in the training phase,\nthese solutions largely rely on negative sampling from unobserved user-item\ninteractions and simply treating them as negative instances, which brings the\nrecommendation performance degradation. To address the issues, we develop a\nCollaborative Reflection-Augmented Autoencoder Network (CRANet), that is\ncapable of exploring transferable knowledge from observed and unobserved\nuser-item interactions. The network architecture of CRANet is formed of an\nintegrative structure with a reflective receptor network and an information\nfusion autoencoder module, which endows our recommendation framework with the\nability of encoding implicit user's pairwise preference on both interacted and\nnon-interacted items. Additionally, a parametric regularization-based\ntied-weight scheme is designed to perform robust joint training of the\ntwo-stage CRANet model. We finally experimentally validate CRANet on four\ndiverse benchmark datasets corresponding to two recommendation tasks, to show\nthat debiasing the negative signals of user-item interactions improves the\nperformance as compared to various state-of-the-art recommendation techniques.\nOur source code is available at https://github.com/akaxlh/CRANet.",

    "abstract": "Rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) has been applied for autonomous parking\ndue to quickly solving high-dimensional motion planning and easily reflecting\nconstraints. However, planning time increases by the low probability of\nextending toward narrow parking spots without collisions. To reduce the\nplanning time, the target tree algorithm was proposed, substituting a parking\ngoal in RRT with a set (target tree) of backward parking paths. However, it\nconsists of circular and straight paths, and an autonomous vehicle cannot park\naccurately because of curvature-discontinuity. Moreover, the planning time\nincreases in complex environments; backward paths can be blocked by obstacles.\nTherefore, this paper introduces the continuous-curvature target tree algorithm\nfor complex parking environments. First, a target tree includes clothoid paths\nto address such curvature-discontinuity. Second, to reduce the planning time\nfurther, a cost function is defined to construct a target tree that considers\nobstacles. Integrated with optimal-variant RRT and searching for the shortest\npath among the reached backward paths, the proposed algorithm obtains a\nnear-optimal path as the sampling time increases. Experiment results in real\nenvironments show that the vehicle more accurately parks, and\ncontinuous-curvature paths are obtained more quickly and with higher success\nrates than those acquired with other sampling-based algorithms.",

    "abstract": "To fully support vertical industries, 5G and its corresponding channel coding\nare expected to meet requirements of different applications. However, for\napplications of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) such as URLLC, the transmission latency\nis required to be much shorter than that in eMBB. Therefore, the resulting\nchannel code length reduces drastically. In this case, the traditional 1-D\nchannel coding suffers a lot from the performance degradation and fails to\ndeliver strong reliability with very low latency. To remove this bottleneck,\nnew channel coding scheme beyond the existing 1-D one is in urgent need. By\nmaking full use of the spacial freedom of massive MIMO systems, this paper\ndevotes itself in proposing a spatiotemporal 2-D channel coding for very low\nlatency reliable transmission. For a very short time-domain code length\n$N^{\\text{time}}=16$, $64 \\times 128$ MIMO system employing the proposed\nspatiotemporal 2-D coding scheme successfully shows more than $3$\\,dB\nperformance gain at $\\text{FER}=10^{-3}$, compared to the 1-D time-domain\nchannel coding. It is noted that the proposed coding scheme is suitable for\ndifferent channel codes and enjoys high flexibility to adapt to difference\nscenarios. By appropriately selecting the code rate, code length, and the\nnumber of codewords in the time and space domains, the proposed coding scheme\ncan achieve a good trade-off between the transmission latency and reliability.",

With the rapid development of deep learning in object\ndetection, pedestrian detection has achieved very good performance in\ntraditional single-dataset training and evaluation setting. However, in this\nstudy on generalizable pedestrian detectors, we show that, current pedestrian\ndetectors poorly handle even small domain shifts in cross-dataset evaluation.\nWe attribute the limited generalization to two main factors, the method and the\ncurrent sources of data. Regarding the method, we illustrate that biasness\npresent in the design choices (e.g anchor settings) of current pedestrian\ndetectors are the main contributing factor to the limited generalization. Most\nmodern pedestrian detectors are tailored towards target dataset, where they do\nachieve high performance in traditional single training and testing pipeline,\nbut suffer a degrade in performance when evaluated through cross-dataset\nevaluation. Consequently, a general object detector performs better in\ncross-dataset evaluation compared with state of the art pedestrian detectors,\ndue to its generic design. As for the data, we show that the autonomous driving\nbenchmarks are monotonous in nature, that is, they are not diverse in scenarios\nand dense in pedestrians. Therefore, benchmarks curated by crawling the web\n(which contain diverse and dense scenarios), are an efficient source of\npre-training for providing a more robust representation.

In this work, we investigate the power of transfer learning for\nall the layers of deep scene text recognition networks from English to two\ncommon Indian languages. We perform experiments on the conventional CRNN model\nand STAR-Net to ensure generalisability. To study the effect of change in\ndifferent scripts, we initially run our experiments on synthetic word images\nrendered using Unicode fonts. We show that the transfer of English models to\nsimple synthetic datasets of Indian languages is not practical. Instead, we\npropose to apply transfer learning techniques among Indian languages due to\nsimilarity in their n-gram distributions and visual features like the vowels\nand conjunct characters. We then study the transfer learning among six Indian\nlanguages with varying complexities in fonts and word length statistics. We\nalso demonstrate that the learned features of the models transferred from other\nIndian languages are visually closer (and sometimes even better) to the\nindividual model features than those transferred from English.

    "title": "An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy System with Integrated Feature Selection and  Rule Extraction for High-Dimensional Classification Problems",
    "abstract": "A major limitation of fuzzy or neuro-fuzzy systems is their failure to deal\nwith high-dimensional datasets. This happens primarily due to the use of\nT-norm, particularly, product or minimum (or a softer version of it). Thus,\nthere are hardly any work dealing with datasets with dimensions more than\nhundred or so. Here, we propose a neuro-fuzzy framework that can handle\ndatasets with dimensions even more than 7000! In this context, we propose an\nadaptive softmin (Ada-softmin) which effectively overcomes the drawbacks of\n``numeric underflow\" and ``fake minimum\" that arise for existing fuzzy systems\nwhile dealing with high-dimensional problems. We call it an Adaptive\nTakagi-Sugeno-Kang (AdaTSK) fuzzy system. We then equip the AdaTSK system to\nperform feature selection and rule extraction in an integrated manner. In this\ncontext, a novel gate function is introduced and embedded only in the\nconsequent parts, which can determine the useful features and rules, in two\nsuccessive phases of learning. Unlike conventional fuzzy rule bases, we design\nan enhanced fuzzy rule base (En-FRB), which maintains adequate rules but does\nnot grow the number of rules exponentially with dimension that typically\nhappens for fuzzy neural networks. The integrated Feature Selection and Rule\nExtraction AdaTSK (FSRE-AdaTSK) system consists of three sequential phases: (i)\nfeature selection, (ii) rule extraction, and (iii) fine tuning. The\neffectiveness of the FSRE-AdaTSK is demonstrated on 19 datasets of which five\nare in more than 2000 dimension including two with dimension greater than 7000.\nThis may be the first time fuzzy systems are realized for classification\ninvolving more than 7000 input features.",

    "title": "Writing Style Aware Document-level Event Extraction",
    "abstract": "Event extraction, the technology that aims to automatically get the\nstructural information from documents, has attracted more and more attention in\nmany fields. Most existing works discuss this issue with the token-level\nmulti-label classification framework by distinguishing the tokens as different\nroles while ignoring the writing styles of documents. The writing style is a\nspecial way of content organizing for documents and it is relative fixed in\ndocuments with a special field (e.g. financial, medical documents, etc.). We\nargue that the writing style contains important clues for judging the roles for\ntokens and the ignorance of such patterns might lead to the performance\ndegradation for the existing works. To this end, we model the writing style in\ndocuments as a distribution of argument roles, i.e., Role-Rank Distribution,\nand propose an event extraction model with the Role-Rank Distribution based\nSupervision Mechanism to capture this pattern through the supervised training\nprocess of an event extraction task. We compare our model with state-of-the-art\nmethods on several real-world datasets. The empirical results show that our\napproach outperforms other alternatives with the captured patterns. This\nverifies the writing style contains valuable information that could improve the\nperformance of the event extraction task.",

    "abstract": "Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has emerged as a novel, general, and\npowerful framework for the design and optimization of non-orthogonal\ntransmission, multiple access (MA), and interference management strategies for\nfuture wireless networks. Through information and communication theoretic\nanalysis, RSMA has been shown to be optimal (from a Degrees-of-Freedom region\nperspective) in several transmission scenarios. Compared to the conventional MA\nstrategies used in 5G, RSMA enables spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency\n(EE), coverage, user fairness, reliability, and quality of service (QoS)\nenhancements for a wide range of network loads (including both underloaded and\noverloaded regimes) and user channel conditions. Furthermore, it enjoys a\nhigher robustness against imperfect channel state information at the\ntransmitter (CSIT) and entails lower feedback overhead and complexity. Despite\nits great potential to fundamentally change the physical (PHY) layer and media\naccess control (MAC) layer of wireless communication networks, RSMA is still\nconfronted with many challenges on the road towards standardization. In this\npaper, we present the first comprehensive overview on RSMA by providing a\nsurvey of the pertinent state-of-the-art research, detailing its architecture,\ntaxonomy, and various appealing applications, as well as comparing with\nexisting MA schemes in terms of their overall frameworks, performance, and\ncomplexities.

    "title": "Label Relation Graphs Enhanced Hierarchical Residual Network for  Hierarchical Multi-Granularity Classification",
    "abstract": "Hierarchical multi-granularity classification (HMC) assigns hierarchical\nmulti-granularity labels to each object and focuses on encoding the label\nhierarchy, e.g., [\"Albatross\", \"Laysan Albatross\"] from coarse-to-fine levels.\nHowever, the definition of what is fine-grained is subjective, and the image\nquality may affect the identification. Thus, samples could be observed at any\nlevel of the hierarchy, e.g., [\"Albatross\"] or [\"Albatross\", \"Laysan\nAlbatross\"], and examples discerned at coarse categories are often neglected in\nthe conventional setting of HMC. In this paper, we study the HMC problem in\nwhich objects are labeled at any level of the hierarchy. The essential designs\nof the proposed method are derived from two motivations: (1) learning with\nobjects labeled at various levels should transfer hierarchical knowledge\nbetween levels; (2) lower-level classes should inherit attributes related to\nupper-level superclasses. The proposed combinatorial loss maximizes the\nmarginal probability of the observed ground truth label by aggregating\ninformation from related labels defined in the tree hierarchy. If the observed\nlabel is at the leaf level, the combinatorial loss further imposes the\nmulti-class cross-entropy loss to increase the weight of fine-grained\nclassification loss. Considering the hierarchical feature interaction, we\npropose a hierarchical residual network (HRN), in which granularity-specific\nfeatures from parent levels acting as residual connections are added to\nfeatures of children levels. Experiments on three commonly used datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art\nHMC approaches and fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) methods exploiting\nthe label hierarchy.",

    "abstract": "Data imputation has been extensively explored to solve the missing data\nproblem. The dramatically increasing volume of incomplete data makes the\nimputation models computationally infeasible in many real-life applications. In\nthis paper, we propose an effective scalable imputation system named SCIS to\nsignificantly speed up the training of the differentiable generative\nadversarial imputation models under accuracy-guarantees for large-scale\nincomplete data. SCIS consists of two modules, differentiable imputation\nmodeling (DIM) and sample size estimation (SSE). DIM leverages a new masking\nSinkhorn divergence function to make an arbitrary generative adversarial\nimputation model differentiable, while for such a differentiable imputation\nmodel, SSE can estimate an appropriate sample size to ensure the user-specified\nimputation accuracy of the final model. Extensive experiments upon several\nreal-life large-scale datasets demonstrate that, our proposed system can\naccelerate the generative adversarial model training by 7.1x. Using around 7.6%\nsamples, SCIS yields competitive accuracy with the state-of-the-art imputation\nmethods in a much shorter computation time.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a distant proactive eavesdropping system in\ncooperative cognitive radio (CR) networks. Specifically, an amplify-and-forward\n(AF) full-duplex (FD) secondary transmitter assists to relay the received\nsignal from suspicious users to legitimate monitor for wireless information\nsurveillance. In return, the secondary transmitter is granted to share the\nspectrum belonging to the suspicious users for its own information\ntransmission. To improve the eavesdropping, the transmitted secondary user's\nsignal can also be used as a jamming signal to moderate the data rate of the\nsuspicious link. We consider two cases, i.e., non-negligible processing delay\n(NNPD) and negligible processing delay (NPD) at secondary transmitter. Our\ntarget is to maximize network energy efficiency (NEE) via jointly optimizing\nthe AF relay matrix and precoding vector at the secondary transmitter, as well\nas the receiver combining vector at monitor, subject to the maximum power\nconstraint at the secondary transmitter and minimum data rate requirement of\nthe secondary user. We also guarantee that the achievable data rate of the\neavesdropping link should be no less than that of the suspicious link for\nefficient surveillance.

This paper proposes a modular framework for\nattention-based graph neural networks (GNN), where attention can be applied to\nany desired component of a graph block. The results show that the model\nsignificantly outperforms a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a bidirectional\nLSTM (BLSTM) model, while delivering performance on-par with a vanilla GNN\nmodel. Moreover, we argue that the proposed graph attention architecture can\neasily adapt to different applications by offering flexibility into the desired\nattention operations to be used, which might depend on the specific\napplication. Through analysis of the attention weights, it was showed that\nemploying attention-based GNNs can provide insights into what the models learn.\nIn particular, the attention networks seemed to realise turbine dependencies\nthat aligned with some physical intuition about wake losses.",

    "abstract": "Nearest neighbor search supports important applications in many domains, such\nas database, machine learning, computer vision. Since the computational cost\nfor accurate search is too high, the community turned to the research of\napproximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). Among them, graph-based algorithm\nis one of the most important branches. Research by Fu et al. shows that the\nalgorithms based on Monotonic Search Network (MSNET), such as NSG and NSSG,\nhave achieved the state-of-the-art search performance in efficiency. The MSNET\nis dedicated to achieving monotonic search with minimal out-degree of nodes to\npursue high efficiency. However, the current MSNET designs did not optimize the\nprobability of the monotonic search, and the lower bound of the probability is\nonly 50%. If they fail in monotonic search stage, they have to suffer\ntremendous backtracking cost to achieve the required accuracy. This will cause\nperformance problems in search efficiency. To address this problem, we propose\n(r,p)-MSNET, which achieves guaranteed probability on monotonic search. Due to\nthe high building complexity of a strict (r,p)-MSNET, we propose TBSG, which is\nan approximation with low complexity. Experiment conducted on four\nmillion-scaled datasets show that TBSG outperforms existing state-of-the-art\ngraph-based algorithms in search efficiency. Our code has been released on\nGithub.",

    "abstract": "With the development of traffic prediction technology, spatiotemporal\nprediction models have attracted more and more attention from academia\ncommunities and industry. However, most existing researches focus on reducing\nmodel's prediction error but ignore the error caused by the uneven distribution\nof spatial events within a region. In this paper, we study a region\npartitioning problem, namely optimal grid size selection problem (OGSS), which\naims to minimize the real error of spatiotemporal prediction models by\nselecting the optimal grid size. In order to solve OGSS, we analyze the upper\nbound of real error of spatiotemporal prediction models and minimize the real\nerror by minimizing its upper bound. Through in-depth analysis, we find that\nthe upper bound of real error will decrease then increase when the number of\nmodel grids increase from 1 to the maximum allowed value. Then, we propose two\nalgorithms, namely Ternary Search and Iterative Method, to automatically find\nthe optimal grid size. Finally, the experiments verify that the error of\nprediction has the same trend as its upper bound, and the change trend of the\nupper bound of real error with respect to the increase of the number of model\ngrids will decrease then increase. Meanwhile, in a case study, by selecting the\noptimal grid size, the order dispatching results of a state-of-the-art\nprediction-based algorithm can be improved up to 13.6%, which shows the\neffectiveness of our methods on tuning the region partition for spatiotemporal\nprediction models.",

In autonomous racing, high speeds\nand small margins demand rapid and accurate detection systems.

In order to improve detection in adverse\nweather, deep-learning-based models typically require extensive datasets\ncaptured in such conditions - the collection of which is a tedious, laborious,\nand costly process. However, recent developments in CycleGAN architectures\nallow the synthesis of highly realistic scenes in multiple weather conditions.\nTo this end, we introduce an approach of using synthesised adverse condition\ndatasets in autonomous racing (generated using CycleGAN) to improve the\nperformance of four out of five state-of-the-art detectors by an average of\n42.7 and 4.4 mAP percentage points in the presence of night-time conditions and\ndroplets, respectively.

To\nestimate the uncertainty in these outcomes, the uncertainty wrapper framework\nhas been proposed, which considers uncertainties related to model fit, input\nquality, and scope compliance. Uncertainty wrappers use a decision tree\napproach to cluster input quality related uncertainties, assigning inputs\nstrictly to distinct uncertainty clusters. Hence, a slight variation in only\none feature may lead to a cluster assignment with a significantly different\nuncertainty. Our objective is to replace this with an approach that mitigates\nhard decision boundaries of these assignments while preserving\ninterpretability, runtime complexity, and prediction performance. Five\napproaches were selected as candidates and integrated into the uncertainty\nwrapper framework. For the evaluation based on the Brier score, datasets for a\npedestrian detection use case were generated using the CARLA simulator and\nYOLOv3. All integrated approaches achieved a softening, i.e., smoothing, of\nuncertainty estimation. Yet, compared to decision trees, they are not so easy\nto interpret and have higher runtime complexity. Moreover, some components of\nthe Brier score impaired while others improved. Most promising regarding the\nBrier score were random forests.

We identified\nsources and types of failures previously overlooked in the literature,\ncombining them into an updated failure taxonomy.

Results indicate that for utilitarian\ndomestic robots, Technical failures were more detrimental to customer\nexperience than Interaction or Service failures.

Future failure-prevention and response strategies should\naddress the technical ability of the robot to meet functional goals, operate\nand maintain structural integrity over time.

    "title": "GhostNets on Heterogeneous Devices via Cheap Operations",
    "abstract": "Deploying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on mobile devices is difficult\ndue to the limited memory and computation resources. We aim to design efficient\nneural networks for heterogeneous devices including CPU and GPU, by exploiting\nthe redundancy in feature maps, which has rarely been investigated in neural\narchitecture design. For CPU-like devices, we propose a novel CPU-efficient\nGhost (C-Ghost) module to generate more feature maps from cheap operations.\nBased on a set of intrinsic feature maps, we apply a series of linear\ntransformations with cheap cost to generate many ghost feature maps that could\nfully reveal information underlying intrinsic features. The proposed C-Ghost\nmodule can be taken as a plug-and-play component to upgrade existing\nconvolutional neural networks. C-Ghost bottlenecks are designed to stack\nC-Ghost modules, and then the lightweight C-GhostNet can be easily established.\nWe further consider the efficient networks for GPU devices. Without involving\ntoo many GPU-inefficient operations (e.g.,, depth-wise convolution) in a\nbuilding stage, we propose to utilize the stage-wise feature redundancy to\nformulate GPU-efficient Ghost (G-Ghost) stage structure. The features in a\nstage are split into two parts where the first part is processed using the\noriginal block with fewer output channels for generating intrinsic features,\nand the other are generated using cheap operations by exploiting stage-wise\nredundancy. Experiments conducted on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed C-Ghost module and the G-Ghost stage. C-GhostNet and G-GhostNet\ncan achieve the optimal trade-off of accuracy and latency for CPU and GPU,\nrespectively. Code is available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/CV-Backbones.",

    "title": "Avoiding Overfitting: A Survey on Regularization Methods for  Convolutional Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Several image processing tasks, such as image classification and object\ndetection, have been significantly improved using Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN). Like ResNet and EfficientNet, many architectures have achieved\noutstanding results in at least one dataset by the time of their creation. A\ncritical factor in training concerns the network's regularization, which\nprevents the structure from overfitting. This work analyzes several\nregularization methods developed in the last few years, showing significant\nimprovements for different CNN models. The works are classified into three main\nareas: the first one is called \"data augmentation\", where all the techniques\nfocus on performing changes in the input data. The second, named \"internal\nchanges\", which aims to describe procedures to modify the feature maps\ngenerated by the neural network or the kernels. The last one, called \"label\",\nconcerns transforming the labels of a given input. This work presents two main\ndifferences comparing to other available surveys about regularization: (i) the\nfirst concerns the papers gathered in the manuscript, which are not older than\nfive years, and (ii) the second distinction is about reproducibility, i.e., all\nworks refered here have their code available in public repositories or they\nhave been directly implemented in some framework, such as TensorFlow or Torch.",

On the other hand, being conceived as\nan academic research library, lifex can be exploited by scientific computing\nexperts to explore new modeling and numerical methodologies within a robust\ndevelopment framework. lifex has been developed with a modular structure and\nwill be released bundled in different modules/packages. This initial release\nincludes a generator for myocardial fibers based on\nLaplace-Dirichlet-Rule-Based-Methods (LDRBMs).

Thus, a smooth trajectory at\na proper speed is necessary for safe tunnel flights. To address these\nchallenges, in this letter, a complete autonomous aerial system that can fly\nsmoothly through tunnels with dimensions narrow to 0.6 m is presented. The\nsystem contains a motion planner that generates smooth mini-jerk trajectories\nalong the tunnel center lines, which are extracted according to the map and\nEuclidean Distance Field (EDF), and its practical speed range is obtained\nthrough computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and flight data analyses.

    "abstract": "We study two \"above guarantee\" versions of the classical Longest Path problem\non undirected and directed graphs and obtain the following results. In the\nfirst variant of Longest Path that we study, called Longest Detour, the task is\nto decide whether a graph has an (s,t)-path of length at least dist_G(s,t)+k\n(where dist_G(s,t) denotes the length of a shortest path from s to t).\nBez\\'akov\\'a et al. proved that on undirected graphs the problem is\nfixed-parameter tractable (FPT) by providing an algorithm of running time 2^{O\n(k)} n. Further, they left the parameterized complexity of the problem on\ndirected graphs open. Our first main result establishes a connection between\nLongest Detour on directed graphs and 3-Disjoint Paths on directed graphs.\nUsing these new insights, we design a 2^{O(k)} n^{O(1)} time algorithm for the\nproblem on directed planar graphs. Further, the new approach yields a\nsignificantly faster FPT algorithm on undirected graphs.\nIn the second variant of Longest Path, namely Longest Path Above Diameter,\nthe task is to decide whether the graph has a path of length at least diam(G)+k\n(diam(G) denotes the length of a longest shortest path in a graph G). We obtain\ndichotomy results about Longest Path Above Diameter on undirected and directed\ngraphs. For (un)directed graphs, Longest Path Above Diameter is NP-complete\neven for k=1. However, if the input undirected graph is 2-connected, then the\nproblem is FPT. On the other hand, for 2-connected directed graphs, we show\nthat Longest Path Above Diameter is solvable in polynomial time for each\nk\\in{1,\\dots, 4} and is NP-complete for every k\\geq 5. The parameterized\ncomplexity of Longest Path Above Diameter on general directed graphs remains an\ninteresting open problem.",

    "abstract": "Due to the significant advancement of Natural Language Processing and\nComputer Vision-based models, Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems are\nbecoming more intelligent and advanced. However, they are still error-prone\nwhen dealing with relatively complex questions. Therefore, it is important to\nunderstand the behaviour of the VQA models before adopting their results. In\nthis paper, we introduce an interpretability approach for VQA models by\ngenerating counterfactual images. Specifically, the generated image is supposed\nto have the minimal possible change to the original image and leads the VQA\nmodel to give a different answer. In addition, our approach ensures that the\ngenerated image is realistic. Since quantitative metrics cannot be employed to\nevaluate the interpretability of the model, we carried out a user study to\nassess different aspects of our approach. In addition to interpreting the\nresult of VQA models on single images, the obtained results and the discussion\nprovides an extensive explanation of VQA models' behaviour.",

In particular, we propose to enhance an\nexisting pretrained language model of code by joint-learning it with a graph\nneural network based on our concept graphs.

Pawlawk can use equivalence classes to represent knowledge,\nbut it cannot process continuous data; neighborhood rough sets can process\ncontinuous data, but it loses the ability of using equivalence classes to\nrepresent knowledge. To this end, this paper presents a granular-ball rough set\nbased on the granlar-ball computing. The granular-ball rough set can\nsimultaneously represent Pawlak rough sets, and the neighborhood rough set, so\nas to realize the unified representation of the two. This makes the\ngranular-ball rough set not only can deal with continuous data, but also can\nuse equivalence classes for knowledge representation. In addition, we propose\nan implementation algorithms of granular-ball rough sets. The experimental\nresuts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that, due to the combination of the\nrobustness and adaptability of the granular-ball computing, the learning\naccuracy of the granular-ball rough set has been greatly improved compared with\nthe Pawlak rough set and the traditional neighborhood rough set.

    "abstract": "The use of social media websites and applications has become very popular and\npeople share their photos on these networks. Automatic recognition and tagging\nof people's photos on these networks has raised privacy preservation issues and\nusers seek methods for hiding their identities from these algorithms.\nGenerative adversarial networks (GANs) are shown to be very powerful in\ngenerating face images in high diversity and also in editing face images. In\nthis paper, we propose a Generative Mask-guided Face Image Manipulation (GMFIM)\nmodel based on GANs to apply imperceptible editing to the input face image to\npreserve the privacy of the person in the image. Our model consists of three\nmain components: a) the face mask module to cut the face area out of the input\nimage and omit the background, b) the GAN-based optimization module for\nmanipulating the face image and hiding the identity and, c) the merge module\nfor combining the background of the input image and the manipulated\nde-identified face image. Different criteria are considered in the loss\nfunction of the optimization step to produce high-quality images that are as\nsimilar as possible to the input image while they cannot be recognized by AFR\nsystems. The results of the experiments on different datasets show that our\nmodel can achieve better performance against automated face recognition systems\nin comparison to the state-of-the-art methods and it catches a higher attack\nsuccess rate in most experiments from a total of 18.

We resolve\nthis issue by proposing a dual-camera SLAM approach that uses a forward facing\nwide-angle camera for localization and a downward facing narrower angle,\nhigh-resolution camera for documentation. Video frames acquired by the forward\nfacing camera video are processed using a standard SLAM approach providing a\ntrajectory of the imaging system through the environment which is then used to\nguide the registration of the documentation camera images. Fragmentary maps,\ninitially produced from the documentation camera images via monocular SLAM, are\nsubsequently scaled and aligned with the localization camera trajectory and\nfinally subjected to a global optimization procedure to produce a unified,\nrefined map. An experimental comparison with several state-of-the-art SfM\napproaches shows the dual-camera SLAM approach to perform better in repetitive\nenvironmental systems based on select samples of ground control point markers.",

    "title": "Enhancing Selective Encryption for H.264/AVC Using Advanced Encryption  Standard",
    "abstract": "Multimedia information availability has increased dramatically with the\nadvent of mobile devices. but with this availability comes problems of\nmaintaining the security of information that is displayed in public. Many\napproaches have been used or proposed for providing security for information\ndissemination over networks, protection system classified with more specific as\nencryption information, and combination between video compression and\nencryption to increase information security. The strength of the combination\nbetween Video compression and encryption science is due to the nonexistence of\nstandard algorithms to be used in video compression and encrypting secret video\nstream. Also there are many ways could be used in video encryption methods such\nas combining several different encryption methods with video compression to\npass a secret video streaming. Furthermore, there is no formal method to be\nfollowed to discover an encrypted video. For this reason, the task of this\npaper becomes difficult. In this paper proposed a new system of video\nencryption is presented. The proposed system aim to gain a deep understanding\nof video data security on multimedia technologies, to investigate how\nencryption and decryption could be implemented for real time video\napplications, and to enhance the selective encryption for H.264/AVC. The system\nincludes two main functions; first is the encoding/encryption of video stream,\nthrough the execution of two processes (the input sequences of video is first\ncompressed by the H.264/AVC encoder, and the encoded bit stream (I-frame) is\npartially encrypted using AES block cipher). And the second function is the\ndecryption/decoding of the encrypted video through two process (specify the\nencrypted I-frame stream, decryption of the I-frame, and decoding with\nH.264/AVC decoder). The system is implemented by using Matlab.",

    "abstract": "Learning problems commonly exhibit an interesting feedback mechanism wherein\nthe population data reacts to competing decision makers' actions. This paper\nformulates a new game theoretic framework for this phenomenon, called\nmulti-player performative prediction. We focus on two distinct solution\nconcepts, namely (i) performatively stable equilibria and (ii) Nash equilibria\nof the game. The latter equilibria are arguably more informative, but can be\nfound efficiently only when the game is monotone. We show that under mild\nassumptions, the performatively stable equilibria can be found efficiently by a\nvariety of algorithms, including repeated retraining and repeated (stochastic)\ngradient play. We then establish transparent sufficient conditions for strong\nmonotonicity of the game and use them to develop algorithms for finding Nash\nequilibria. We investigate derivative free methods and adaptive gradient\nalgorithms wherein each player alternates between learning a parametric\ndescription of their distribution and gradient steps on the empirical risk.\nSynthetic and semi-synthetic numerical experiments illustrate the results.",

    "abstract": "Autograding short textual answers has become much more feasible due to the\nrise of NLP and the increased availability of question-answer pairs brought\nabout by a shift to online education. Autograding performance is still inferior\nto human grading. The statistical and black-box nature of state-of-the-art\nmachine learning models makes them untrustworthy, raising ethical concerns and\nlimiting their practical utility. Furthermore, the evaluation of autograding is\ntypically confined to small, monolingual datasets for a specific question type.\nThis study uses a large dataset consisting of about 10 million question-answer\npairs from multiple languages covering diverse fields such as math and\nlanguage, and strong variation in question and answer syntax. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of fine-tuning transformer models for autograding for such\ncomplex datasets. Our best hyperparameter-tuned model yields an accuracy of\nabout 86.5\\%, comparable to the state-of-the-art models that are less general\nand more tuned to a specific type of question, subject, and language. More\nimportantly, we address trust and ethical concerns. By involving humans in the\nautograding process, we show how to improve the accuracy of automatically\ngraded answers, achieving accuracy equivalent to that of teaching assistants.\nWe also show how teachers can effectively control the type of errors made by\nthe system and how they can validate efficiently that the autograder's\nperformance on individual exams is close to the expected performance.",

This work presents a novel direction towards\ngenerating face morphing attacks in 3D.

We then back-project the 2D\nmorphing color-map and the depth-map to the point cloud using the canonical\n(fixed) view. Given that the generated 3D face morphing models will result in\nthe holes due to a single canonical view, we have proposed a new algorithm for\nhole filling that will result in a high-quality 3D face morphing model.\nExtensive experiments are carried out on the newly generated 3D face dataset\ncomprised of 675 3D scans corresponding to 41 unique data subjects.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning has received attention from researchers, as it\nallows one to exploit the structure of unlabeled data to achieve competitive\nclassification results with much fewer labels than supervised approaches. The\nLocal and Global Consistency (LGC) algorithm is one of the most well-known\ngraph-based semi-supervised (GSSL) classifiers. Notably, its solution can be\nwritten as a linear combination of the known labels. The coefficients of this\nlinear combination depend on a parameter $\\alpha$, determining the decay of the\nreward over time when reaching labeled vertices in a random walk. In this work,\nwe discuss how removing the self-influence of a labeled instance may be\nbeneficial, and how it relates to leave-one-out error. Moreover, we propose to\nminimize this leave-one-out loss with automatic differentiation. Within this\nframework, we propose methods to estimate label reliability and diffusion rate.\nOptimizing the diffusion rate is more efficiently accomplished with a spectral\nrepresentation. Results show that the label reliability approach competes with\nrobust L1-norm methods and that removing diagonal entries reduces the risk of\noverfitting and leads to suitable criteria for parameter selection.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a framework to compute the aggregated day-ahead dispatch\nplans of multiple and interconnected distribution grids operating at different\nvoltage levels. Specifically, the proposed framework optimizes the dispatch\nplan of an upstream medium voltage (MV) grid accounting for the flexibility\noffered by downstream low voltage (LV) grids and the knowledge of the\nuncertainties of the stochastic resources. The framework considers grid, i.e.,\noperational limits on the nodal voltages, lines, and transformer capacity using\na linearized grid model, and controllable resources' constraints. The problem\nis formulated as a stochastic-optimization scheme considering uncertainty on\nstochastic power generation and demands and the voltage imposed by the upstream\ngrid. The problem is solved by a distributed optimization method relying on\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) that splits the main problem\ninto one aggregator problem solved at the MV-grid level and several local\nproblems solved at the MV-connected-controllable-resources and LV-grid levels.\nThe use of distributed optimization enables privacy-aware dispatch computation\nwhere the centralized aggregator is agnostic of the parameters of the\nparticipating resources and downstream grids. The framework is validated for\ninterconnected CIGRE medium- and low-voltage networks hosting heterogeneous\nstochastic and controllable resources.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we consider latency in wireless networks, motivated by the need\nfor reliable and low-latency wireless communication for applications such as\nvehicle-to-vehicle communication and industrial automation. The environment\nthat these applications operate in is often highly dynamic, and, as a result,\nthe wireless network technology used needs to be able to adapt to changing\nconditions, which makes mesh networking a good fit. Hence, in this work, we\nconsider Thread and Bluetooth Mesh, two prominent mesh networking technologies.\nWe measure one-way point-to-point latency using these technologies and show the\ncumulative probability distribution of the latency for varying payload size. We\ncarry out the measurements under static conditions in an open-air environment.\nOur results show that Thread achieves lower latency than Bluetooth Mesh,\nespecially for larger payloads. Furthermore, we show that Thread meets some of\nthe latency targets set out for 5G. However, since Thread networks are slow to\nadapt to network changes, Thread may still not be suitable for application\nrequiring low latency. Bluetooth mesh, on the other hand, does not meet any of\nthe latency targets, although it is close when the payload is small (less than\n11 bytes). Overall, there needs to be further optimization before these\ntechnologies can be used for reliable and low-latency communication in dynamic\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) has drawn increasingly research attention\nin recent years, due to its great practical value by only exploiting the\nlimited user behavior history in the current session. Existing methods\ntypically learn the session embedding at the item level, namely, aggregating\nthe embeddings of items with or without the attention weights assigned to\nitems. However, they ignore the fact that a user's intent on adopting an item\nis driven by certain factors of the item (e.g., the leading actors of an\nmovie). In other words, they have not explored finer-granularity interests of\nusers at the factor level to generate the session embedding, leading to\nsub-optimal performance. To address the problem, we propose a novel method\ncalled Disentangled Graph Neural Network (Disen-GNN) to capture the session\npurpose with the consideration of factor-level attention on each item.\nSpecifically, we first employ the disentangled learning technique to cast item\nembeddings into the embedding of multiple factors, and then use the gated graph\nneural network (GGNN) to learn the embedding factor-wisely based on the item\nadjacent similarity matrix computed for each factor. Moreover, the distance\ncorrelation is adopted to enhance the independence between each pair of\nfactors. After representing each item with independent factors, an attention\nmechanism is designed to learn user intent to different factors of each item in\nthe session. The session embedding is then generated by aggregating the item\nembeddings with attention weights of each item's factors. To this end, our\nmodel takes user intents at the factor level into account to infer the user\npurpose in a session. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Media streaming has been adopted for a variety of applications such as\nentertainment, visualization, and design. Unlike video/audio streaming where\nthe content is usually consumed sequentially, 3D applications such as gaming\nrequire streaming 3D assets to facilitate client-side interactions such as\nobject manipulation and viewpoint movement. Compared to audio and video\nstreaming, 3D streaming often requires larger data sizes and yet lower latency\nto ensure sufficient rendering quality, resolution, and latency for perceptual\ncomfort. Thus, streaming 3D assets can be even more challenging than streaming\naudios/videos, and existing solutions often suffer from long loading time or\nlimited quality.\nTo address this critical and timely issue, we propose a\nperceptually-optimized progressive 3D streaming method for spatial quality and\ntemporal consistency in immersive interactions. Based on the human visual\nmechanisms in the frequency domain, our model selects and schedules the\nstreaming dataset for optimal spatial-temporal quality. We also train a neural\nnetwork for our model to accelerate this decision process for real-time\nclient-server applications. We evaluate our method via subjective studies and\nobjective analysis under varying network conditions (from 3G to 5G) and client\ndevices (HMD and traditional displays), and demonstrate better visual quality\nand temporal consistency than alternative solutions.",

    "abstract": "Garg, Goldwasser and Vasudevan (Eurocrypt 2020) invented the notion of\ndeletion-compliance to formally model the \"right to be forgotten\", a concept\nthat confers individuals more control over their digital data. A requirement of\ndeletion-compliance is strong privacy for the deletion requesters since no\noutside observer must be able to tell if deleted data was ever present in the\nfirst place. Naturally, many real world systems where information can flow\nacross users are automatically ruled out.\nThe main thesis of this paper is that deletion-compliance is a standalone\nnotion, distinct from privacy. We present an alternative definition that\nmeaningfully captures deletion-compliance without any privacy implications.\nThis allows broader class of data collectors to demonstrate compliance to\ndeletion requests and to be paired with various notions of privacy. Our new\ndefinition has several appealing properties:\n- It is implied by the stronger definition of Garg et al. under natural\nconditions, and is equivalent when we add a privacy requirement.\n- It is naturally composable with minimal assumptions.\n- Its requirements are met by data structure implementations that do not\nreveal the order of operations, a concept known as history-independence.\nAlong the way, we discuss the many challenges that remain in providing a\nuniversal definition of compliance to the \"right to be forgotten.\"",

    "abstract": "Humanitarian crises, such as the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic, challenge\ninformation management and thereby threaten the digital resilience of the\nresponding organizations. Crisis information management (CIM) is characterised\nby the urgency to respond despite the uncertainty of the situation. Coupled\nwith high stakes, limited resources and a high cognitive load, crises are prone\nto induce biases in the data and the cognitive processes of analysts and\ndecision-makers. When biases remain undetected and untreated in CIM, they may\nlead to decisions based on biased information, increasing the risk of an\ninefficient response. Literature suggests that crisis response needs to address\nthe initial uncertainty and possible biases by adapting to new and better\ninformation as it becomes available. However, we know little about whether\nadaptive approaches mitigate the interplay of data and cognitive biases.\nWe investigated this question in an exploratory, three-stage experiment on\nepidemic response. Our participants were experienced practitioners in the\nfields of crisis decision-making and information analysis. We found that\nanalysts fail to successfully debias data, even when biases are detected, and\nthat this failure can be attributed to undervaluing debiasing efforts in favor\nof rapid results. This failure leads to the development of biased information\nproducts that are conveyed to decision-makers, who consequently make decisions\nbased on biased information. Confirmation bias reinforces the reliance on\nconclusions reached with biased data, leading to a vicious cycle, in which\nbiased assumptions remain uncorrected. We suggest mindful debiasing as a\npossible counter-strategy against these bias effects in CIM.",

    "abstract": "Extremely large pre-trained language models (PTMs) such as GPT-3 are usually\nreleased as a service, allowing users to design task-specific prompts to query\nthe PTMs through some black-box APIs. In such a scenario, which we call\nLanguage-Model-as-a-Service (LMaaS), gradients of the PTMs are usually not\navailable. Can we optimize the task prompts by only accessing the model\ninference APIs? Based on recent observations that large PTMs have a very low\nintrinsic dimensionality, this work proposes the Black-Box Tuning to optimize\nPTMs through derivative-free algorithms. In particular, we invoke the CMA-ES to\noptimize the continuous prompt prepended to the input text by iteratively\ncalling PTM inference APIs. Our experimental results demonstrate that,\nblack-box tuning with RoBERTa on a few labeled samples not only significantly\noutperforms manual prompt and GPT-3's in-context learning, but also surpasses\nthe gradient-based counterparts, namely prompt tuning and full model tuning.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent breakthroughs in Machine Learning for Natural Language\nProcessing, the Natural Language Inference (NLI) problems still constitute a\nchallenge. To this purpose we contribute a new dataset that focuses exclusively\non the factivity phenomenon; however, our task remains the same as other NLI\ntasks, i.e. prediction of entailment, contradiction or neutral (ECN). The\ndataset contains entirely natural language utterances in Polish and gathers\n2,432 verb-complement pairs and 309 unique verbs. The dataset is based on the\nNational Corpus of Polish (NKJP) and is a representative sample in regards to\nfrequency of main verbs and other linguistic features (e.g. occurrence of\ninternal negation). We found that transformer BERT-based models working on\nsentences obtained relatively good results ($\\approx89\\%$ F1 score). Even\nthough better results were achieved using linguistic features ($\\approx91\\%$ F1\nscore), this model requires more human labour (humans in the loop) because\nfeatures were prepared manually by expert linguists. BERT-based models\nconsuming only the input sentences show that they capture most of the\ncomplexity of NLI/factivity. Complex cases in the phenomenon - e.g. cases with\nentitlement (E) and non-factive verbs - remain an open issue for further\nresearch.",

However, it\nis still a challenging task due to: (1) the HCC information on NCMRI is\ninvisible or insufficient makes extraction of liver tumors feature difficult;\n(2) diverse imaging characteristics in multi-modality NCMRI causes feature\nfusion and selection difficult; (3) no specific information between hemangioma\nand HCC on NCMRI cause liver tumors detection difficult. In this study, we\npropose a united adversarial learning framework (UAL) for simultaneous liver\ntumors segmentation and detection using multi-modality NCMRI. The UAL first\nutilizes a multi-view aware encoder to extract multi-modality NCMRI information\nfor liver tumor segmentation and detection. In this encoder, a novel edge\ndissimilarity feature pyramid module is designed to facilitate the\ncomplementary multi-modality feature extraction. Second, the newly designed\nfusion and selection channel is used to fuse the multi-modality feature and\nmake the decision of the feature selection. Then, the proposed mechanism of\ncoordinate sharing with padding integrates the multi-task of segmentation and\ndetection so that it enables multi-task to perform united adversarial learning\nin one discriminator. Lastly, an innovative multi-phase radiomics guided\ndiscriminator exploits the clear and specific tumor information to improve the\nmulti-task performance via the adversarial learning strategy. The UAL is\nvalidated in corresponding multi-modality NCMRI (i.e. T1FS pre-contrast MRI,\nT2FS MRI, and DWI) and three phases contrast-enhanced MRI of 255 clinical\nsubjects.

    "abstract": "The paper deals with Video Coding for Machines that is a new paradigm in\nvideo coding related to consumption of decoded video by humans and machines.\nFor such tasks, joint transmission of compressed video and features is\nconsidered. In this paper, we focus our considerations of features on SIFT\nkeypoints. They can be extracted from the decoded video with losses in number\nof keypoints and their parameters as compared to the SIFT keypoints extracted\nfrom the original video. Such losses are studied for HEVC and VVC as functions\nof the quantization parameter and the bitrate. In the paper, we propose to\ntransmit the residual feature data together with the compressed video.\nTherefore, even for strongly compressed video, the transmission of whole all\nSIFT keypoint information is avoided.",

In this paper we focus on unsupervised\ntechniques for analyzing spectral data from transiting exoplanets. We\ndemonstrate methods for i) cleaning and validating the data, ii) initial\nexploratory data analysis based on summary statistics (estimates of location\nand variability), iii) exploring and quantifying the existing correlations in\nthe data, iv) pre-processing and linearly transforming the data to its\nprincipal components, v) dimensionality reduction and manifold learning, vi)\nclustering and anomaly detection, vii) visualization and interpretation of the\ndata. To illustrate the proposed unsupervised methodology, we use a well-known\npublic benchmark data set of synthetic transit spectra. We show that there is a\nhigh degree of correlation in the spectral data, which calls for appropriate\nlow-dimensional representations. We explore a number of different techniques\nfor such dimensionality reduction and identify several suitable options in\nterms of summary statistics, principal components, etc. We uncover interesting\nstructures in the principal component basis, namely, well-defined branches\ncorresponding to different chemical regimes of the underlying atmospheres. We\ndemonstrate that those branches can be successfully recovered with a K-means\nclustering algorithm in fully unsupervised fashion.

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency, which is a major cause of\ndeath worldwide and the second highest cause of mortality in the United States.\nResearching the optimal control treatment or intervention strategy on the\ncomprehensive sepsis system is key in reducing mortality. For this purpose,\nfirst, this paper improves a complex nonlinear sepsis model proposed in our\nprevious work. Then, bifurcation analyses are conducted for each sepsis\nsubsystem to study the model behaviors under some system parameters. The\nbifurcation analysis results also further indicate the necessity of control\ntreatment and intervention therapy. If the sepsis system is without adding any\ncontrol under some parameter and initial system value settings, the system will\nperform persistent inflammation outcomes as time goes by. Therefore, we develop\nour complex improved nonlinear sepsis model into a sepsis optimal control\nmodel, and then use some effective biomarkers recommended in existing clinic\npractices as optimization objective function to measure the development of\nsepsis. Besides that, a Bayesian optimization algorithm by combining Recurrent\nneural network (RNN-BO algorithm) is introduced to predict the optimal control\nstrategy for the studied sepsis optimal control system. The difference between\nthe RNN-BO algorithm from other optimization algorithms is that once given any\nnew initial system value setting (initial value is associated with the initial\nconditions of patients), the RNN-BO algorithm is capable of quickly predicting\na corresponding time-series optimal control based on the historical optimal\ncontrol data for any new sepsis patient. To demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the RNN-BO algorithm on solving the optimal control solution on\nthe complex nonlinear sepsis system, some numerical simulations are implemented\nby comparing with other optimization algorithms in this paper.",

Limited bandwidth in existing standards and use of phase-shifters in\nanalog/hybrid phased-antenna arrays (PAA) are not suited for these emerging\nstandards demanding low-latency direction finding. This work proposes a\nreconfigurable true-time-delay (TTD) based spatial signal processor (SSP) with\nfrequency-division beam training methodology and wideband beam-squint less data\ncommunications. Discrete-time delay compensated clocking technique is used to\nsupport 800~MHz bandwidth with a large unity-gain bandwidth ring-amplifier\n(RAMP)-based signal combiner. To extensively characterize the proposed SSP\nacross different SSP modes and frequency-angle pairs, an automated testbed is\ndeveloped using computer-vision techniques that significantly speeds up the\ntesting progress and minimize possible human errors. Using seven levels of\ntime-interleaving for each of the 4 antenna elements, the TTD SSP has a delay\nrange of 3.8 ns over 800 MHz and achieves unique frequency-to-angle mapping in\nthe beamtraining mode with nearly 12 dB frequency-independent gain in the\nbeamforming mode. The SSP is prototyped in 65nm CMOS with an area of 1.98mm$^2$\nconsuming only 29 mW excluding buffers.

With the use of popular\ntransducer-based models, it has become possible to practically deploy streaming\nspeech recognition models on small devices [1]. Recently, the two-pass model\n[2] combining RNN-T and LAS modules has shown exceptional performance for\nstreaming on-device speech recognition.\nIn this work, we propose a simple and effective approach to reduce the size\nof the two-pass model for memory-constrained devices. We employ a popular\nknowledge distillation approach in three stages using the Teacher-Student\ntraining technique. In the first stage, we use a trained RNN-T model as a\nteacher model and perform knowledge distillation to train the student RNN-T\nmodel. The second stage uses the shared encoder and trains a LAS rescorer for\nstudent model using the trained RNN-T+LAS teacher model. Finally, we perform\ndeep-finetuning for the student model with a shared RNN-T encoder, RNN-T\ndecoder, and LAS rescorer. Our experimental results on standard LibriSpeech\ndataset show that our system can achieve a high compression rate of 55% without\nsignificant degradation in the WER compared to the two-pass teacher model.",

    "abstract": "Radiomics and deep learning have shown high popularity in automatic glioma\ngrading. Radiomics can extract hand-crafted features that quantitatively\ndescribe the expert knowledge of glioma grades, and deep learning is powerful\nin extracting a large number of high-throughput features that facilitate the\nfinal classification. However, the performance of existing methods can still be\nimproved as their complementary strengths have not been sufficiently\ninvestigated and integrated. Furthermore, lesion maps are usually needed for\nthe final prediction at the testing phase, which is very troublesome. In this\npaper, we propose an expert knowledge-guided geometric representation learning\n(ENROL) framework . Geometric manifolds of hand-crafted features and learned\nfeatures are constructed to mine the implicit relationship between deep\nlearning and radiomics, and therefore to dig mutual consent and essential\nrepresentation for the glioma grades. With a specially designed manifold\ndiscrepancy measurement, the grading model can exploit the input image data and\nexpert knowledge more effectively in the training phase and get rid of the\nrequirement of lesion segmentation maps at the testing phase. The proposed\nframework is flexible regarding deep learning architectures to be utilized.\nThree different architectures have been evaluated and five models have been\ncompared, which show that our framework can always generate promising results.",

In this context, most\nresearchers have tried to classify hyperspectral images by using deep learning\nmethods and classification success over 90% has been achieved for these images.\nDeep neural networks (DNN) actually consist of two parts: i) Convolutional\nneural network (CNN) and ii) fully connected neural network (FCNN). While CNN\ndetermines the features, FCNN is used in classification. In classification of\nthe hyperspectral images, it is observed that almost all of the researchers\nused 2D or 3D convolution filters on the spatial data beside spectral data\n(features). It is convenient to use convolution filters on images or time\nsignals. In hyperspectral images, each pixel is represented by a signature\nvector which consists of individual features that are independent of each\nother. Since the order of the features in the vector can be changed, it doesn't\nmake sense to use convolution filters on these features as on time signals. At\nthe same time, since the hyperspectral images do not have a textural structure,\nthere is no need to use spatial data besides spectral data. In this study,\nhyperspectral images of Indian pines, Salinas, Pavia centre, Pavia university\nand Botswana are classified by using only fully connected neural network and\nthe spectral data with one dimensional.

    "abstract": "Domain Adaptation (DA) has recently raised strong interests in the medical\nimaging community. While a large variety of DA techniques has been proposed for\nimage segmentation, most of these techniques have been validated either on\nprivate datasets or on small publicly available datasets. Moreover, these\ndatasets mostly addressed single-class problems. To tackle these limitations,\nthe Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge was organised in\nconjunction with the 24th International Conference on Medical Image Computing\nand Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2021). CrossMoDA is the first large\nand multi-class benchmark for unsupervised cross-modality DA. The challenge's\ngoal is to segment two key brain structures involved in the follow-up and\ntreatment planning of vestibular schwannoma (VS): the VS and the cochleas.\nCurrently, the diagnosis and surveillance in patients with VS are performed\nusing contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) MRI. However, there is growing interest in\nusing non-contrast sequences such as high-resolution T2 (hrT2) MRI. Therefore,\nwe created an unsupervised cross-modality segmentation benchmark. The training\nset provides annotated ceT1 (N=105) and unpaired non-annotated hrT2 (N=105).\nThe aim was to automatically perform unilateral VS and bilateral cochlea\nsegmentation on hrT2 as provided in the testing set (N=137). A total of 16\nteams submitted their algorithm for the evaluation phase. The level of\nperformance reached by the top-performing teams is strikingly high (best median\nDice - VS:88.4%; Cochleas:85.7%) and close to full supervision (median Dice -\nVS:92.5%; Cochleas:87.7%). All top-performing methods made use of an\nimage-to-image translation approach to transform the source-domain images into\npseudo-target-domain images. A segmentation network was then trained using\nthese generated images and the manual annotations provided for the source\nimage.",

    "title": "SGUIE-Net: Semantic Attention Guided Underwater Image Enhancement with  Multi-Scale Perception",
    "abstract": "Due to the wavelength-dependent light attenuation, refraction and scattering,\nunderwater images usually suffer from color distortion and blurred details.\nHowever, due to the limited number of paired underwater images with undistorted\nimages as reference, training deep enhancement models for diverse degradation\ntypes is quite difficult. To boost the performance of data-driven approaches,\nit is essential to establish more effective learning mechanisms that mine\nricher supervised information from limited training sample resources. In this\npaper, we propose a novel underwater image enhancement network, called\nSGUIE-Net, in which we introduce semantic information as high-level guidance\nacross different images that share common semantic regions. Accordingly, we\npropose semantic region-wise enhancement module to perceive the degradation of\ndifferent semantic regions from multiple scales and feed it back to the global\nattention features extracted from its original scale. This strategy helps to\nachieve robust and visually pleasant enhancements to different semantic\nobjects, which should thanks to the guidance of semantic information for\ndifferentiated enhancement. More importantly, for those degradation types that\nare not common in the training sample distribution, the guidance connects them\nwith the already well-learned types according to their semantic relevance.\nExtensive experiments on the publicly available datasets and our proposed\ndataset demonstrated the impressive performance of SGUIE-Net. The code and\nproposed dataset are available at: https://trentqq.github.io/SGUIE-Net.html",

    "abstract": "Using single-pixel detection, the end-to-end neural network that jointly\noptimizes both encoding and decoding enables high-precision imaging and\nhigh-level semantic sensing. However, for varied sampling rates, the\nlarge-scale network requires retraining that is laboursome and\ncomputation-consuming. In this letter, we report a weighted optimization\ntechnique for dynamic rate-adaptive single-pixel imaging and sensing, which\nonly needs to train the network for one time that is available for any sampling\nrates. Specifically, we introduce a novel weighting scheme in the encoding\nprocess to characterize different patterns' modulation efficiency. While the\nnetwork is training at a high sampling rate, the modulation patterns and\ncorresponding weights are updated iteratively, which produces optimal ranked\nencoding series when converged. In the experimental implementation, the optimal\npattern series with the highest weights are employed for light modulation, thus\nachieving highly-efficient imaging and sensing. The reported strategy saves the\nadditional training of another low-rate network required by the existing\ndynamic single-pixel networks, which further doubles training efficiency.\nExperiments on the MNIST dataset validated that once the network is trained\nwith a sampling rate of 1, the average imaging PSNR reaches 23.50 dB at 0.1\nsampling rate, and the image-free classification accuracy reaches up to 95.00\\%\nat a sampling rate of 0.03 and 97.91\\% at a sampling rate of 0.1.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an emerging technology for future\nwireless communication systems. In this work, we consider downlink spatial\nmultiplexing enabled by the RIS for weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization. In\nthe literature, most solutions use alternating gradient-based optimization,\nwhich has moderate performance, high complexity, and limited scalability. We\npropose to apply a fully convolutional network (FCN) to solve this problem,\nwhich was originally designed for semantic segmentation of images. The\nrectangular shape of the RIS and the spatial correlation of channels with\nadjacent RIS antennas due to the short distance between them encourage us to\napply it for the RIS configuration. We design a set of channel features that\nincludes both cascaded channels via the RIS and the direct channel. In the base\nstation (BS), the differentiable minimum mean squared error (MMSE) precoder is\nused for pretraining and the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE)\nprecoder is then applied for fine-tuning, which is nondifferentiable, more\ncomplex, but achieves a better performance. Evaluation results show that the\nproposed solution has higher performance and allows for a faster evaluation\nthan the baselines. Hence it scales better to a large number of antennas,\nadvancing the RIS one step closer to practical deployment.",

The\npresent review aims to (i) compare and contrast these new methods, while (ii)\npresenting them from a perspective and using terminology familiar to scientists\nin each of the five aforementioned fields with no specific background in\ncryo-EM. The review begins with an introduction to the mathematical and\ncomputational challenges of deep generative models for cryo-EM volume\nreconstruction, along with an overview of the baseline methodology shared\nacross this class of algorithms.

In particular, there\nis often a need for designing a new model out of an existing structural family\nof models, which share a structural pattern but have individually varied detail\nfeatures. To facilitate such design requirements, a new method is presented in\nthis paper. The idea is to express the underlying structural pattern in terms\nof a submodel composed of the maximum common design features of the family, and\nthen to build a single master model by attaching to the submodel all detail\ndesign features in the family. This master model is a representative model for\nthe family and contains all the features.

Although\nthese models proved to be effective in many vision tasks such as image\nrecognition, there remain challenges in adapting them for low-level vision. The\ninflexibility to support high-resolution images and limitations of local\nattention are perhaps the main bottlenecks for using Transformers and MLPs in\nimage restoration. In this work we present a multi-axis MLP based architecture,\ncalled MAXIM, that can serve as an efficient and flexible general-purpose\nvision backbone for image processing tasks. MAXIM uses a UNet-shaped\nhierarchical structure and supports long-range interactions enabled by\nspatially-gated MLPs. Specifically, MAXIM contains two MLP-based building\nblocks: a multi-axis gated MLP that allows for efficient and scalable spatial\nmixing of local and global visual cues, and a cross-gating block, an\nalternative to cross-attention, which accounts for cross-feature mutual\nconditioning. Both these modules are exclusively based on MLPs, but also\nbenefit from being both global and `fully-convolutional', two properties that\nare desirable for image processing. Our extensive experimental results show\nthat the proposed MAXIM model achieves state-of-the-art performance on more\nthan ten benchmarks across a range of image processing tasks, including\ndenoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and enhancement while requiring\nfewer or comparable numbers of parameters and FLOPs than competitive models.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a segmentation method of infection regions in the lung\nfrom CT volumes of COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 spread worldwide, causing many\ninfected patients and deaths. CT image-based diagnosis of COVID-19 can provide\nquick and accurate diagnosis results. An automated segmentation method of\ninfection regions in the lung provides a quantitative criterion for diagnosis.\nPrevious methods employ whole 2D image or 3D volume-based processes. Infection\nregions have a considerable variation in their sizes. Such processes easily\nmiss small infection regions. Patch-based process is effective for segmenting\nsmall targets. However, selecting the appropriate patch size is difficult in\ninfection region segmentation. We utilize the scale uncertainty among various\nreceptive field sizes of a segmentation FCN to obtain infection regions. The\nreceptive field sizes can be defined as the patch size and the resolution of\nvolumes where patches are clipped from. This paper proposes an infection\nsegmentation network (ISNet) that performs patch-based segmentation and a scale\nuncertainty-aware prediction aggregation method that refines the segmentation\nresult. We design ISNet to segment infection regions that have various\nintensity values. ISNet has multiple encoding paths to process patch volumes\nnormalized by multiple intensity ranges. We collect prediction results\ngenerated by ISNets having various receptive field sizes. Scale uncertainty\namong the prediction results is extracted by the prediction aggregation method.\nWe use an aggregation FCN to generate a refined segmentation result considering\nscale uncertainty among the predictions. In our experiments using 199 chest CT\nvolumes of COVID-19 cases, the prediction aggregation method improved the dice\nsimilarity score from 47.6% to 62.1%.",

    "title": "Phase field fracture predictions of microscopic bridging behaviour of  composite materials",
    "abstract": "We investigate the role of microstructural bridging on the fracture toughness\nof composite materials. To achieve this, a new computational framework is\npresented that integrates phase field fracture and cohesive zone models to\nsimulate fibre breakage, matrix cracking and fibre-matrix debonding. The\ncomposite microstructure is represented by an embedded cell at the vicinity of\nthe crack tip, whilst the rest of the sample is modelled as an anisotropic\nelastic solid. The model is first validated against experimental data of\ntransverse matrix cracking from single-notched three-point bending tests. Then,\nthe model is extended to predict the influence of grain bridging,\nbrick-and-mortar microstructure and 3D fibre bridging on crack growth\nresistance. The results show that these microstructures are very efficient in\nenhancing the fracture toughness via fibre-matrix debonding, fibre breakage and\ncrack deflection. In particular, the 3D fibre bridging effect can increase the\nenergy dissipated at failure by more than three orders of magnitude, relative\nto that of the bulk matrix; well in excess of the predictions obtained from the\nrule of mixtures. These results shed light on microscopic bridging mechanisms\nand provide a virtual tool for developing high fracture toughness composites.",

In\nparticular, we concentrate on three problems with multiple weight functions:\nthe inverse shortest $s$-$t$ path, the inverse bipartite perfect matching, and\nthe inverse arborescence problems. Using LP duality, we give min-max\ncharacterizations for the $\\ell_1$-norm of an optimal deviation vector.\nFurthermore, we show that the optimal $p$ is not necessarily integral even when\nthe weight functions are so, therefore computing an optimal solution is\nsignificantly more difficult than for the single-weighted case.

The one-bit observations of the DFT correspond to the\nsign of its real part, whereas, the two-bit observations of the DFT correspond\nto the signs of both the real and imaginary parts of the DFT. We focus on\nimages for analysis and simulations, thus using the sign of the 2D-DFT.

The samples are affected by additive zero-mean noise of known\ndistribution. We solve this signal estimation problem by designing an algorithm\nthat uses contraction mapping, based on the Banach fixed point theorem.\nNumerical tests with four benchmark images are provided to show the\neffectiveness of our algorithm.

One of the main\ndownsides of DCNNs is the complex non-intuitive rules that make DCNNs act as a\n``black box\", providing annotations in a manner that is unclear to the user.\nTherefore, the user is often not able to know what information is used by the\nDCNNs for the classification. Here we demonstrate that the training of a DCNN\nis sensitive to the context of the training data such as the location of the\nobjects in the sky. We show that for basic classification of elliptical and\nspiral galaxies, the sky location of the galaxies used for training affects the\nbehavior of the algorithm, and leads to a small but consistent and\nstatistically significant bias. That bias exhibits itself in the form of\ncosmological-scale anisotropy in the distribution of basic galaxy morphology.\nTherefore, while DCNNs are powerful tools for annotating images of extended\nsources, the construction of training sets for galaxy morphology should take\ninto consideration more aspects than the visual appearance of the object.

Existing supervised enlightening\nalgorithms require a large set of pixel-aligned training image pairs, which are\nhard to prepare in practice. Though weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods\ncan alleviate such challenges without using paired training images, some\nreal-world artifacts inevitably get falsely amplified because of the lack of\ncorresponded supervision. In this paper, instead of using perfectly aligned\nimages for training, we creatively employ the misaligned real-world images as\nthe guidance, which are considerably easier to collect. Specifically, we\npropose a Cross-Image Disentanglement Network (CIDN) to separately extract\ncross-image brightness and image-specific content features from\nlow/normal-light images. Based on that, CIDN can simultaneously correct the\nbrightness and suppress image artifacts in the feature domain, which largely\nincreases the robustness to the pixel shifts. Furthermore, we collect a new\nlow-light image enhancement dataset consisting of misaligned training images\nwith real-world corruptions.

Computational photography tasks such as\nimage denoising and colour constancy are commonly performed in the RAW domain,\nin part due to the inherent hardware design, but also due to the appealing\nsimplicity of noise statistics that result from the direct sensor readings.\nDespite this, the availability of RAW images is limited in comparison with the\nabundance and diversity of available RGB data. Recent approaches have attempted\nto bridge this gap by estimating the RGB to RAW mapping: handcrafted\nmodel-based methods that are interpretable and controllable usually require\nmanual parameter fine-tuning, while end-to-end learnable neural networks\nrequire large amounts of training data, at times with complex training\nprocedures, and generally lack interpretability and parametric control.

However, reliable monitoring\nrequires high-quality heart and lung sounds. This paper presents novel\nNon-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) and Non-negative Matrix\nCo-Factorisation (NMCF) methods for neonatal chest sound separation. To assess\nthese methods and compare with existing single-source separation methods, an\nartificial mixture dataset was generated comprising of heart, lung and noise\nsounds. Signal-to-noise ratios were then calculated for these artificial\nmixtures. These methods were also tested on real-world noisy neonatal chest\nsounds and assessed based on vital sign estimation error and a signal quality\nscore of 1-5 developed in our previous works. Additionally, the computational\ncost of all methods was assessed to determine the applicability for real-time\nprocessing. Overall, both the proposed NMF and NMCF methods outperform the next\nbest existing method by 2.7dB to 11.6dB for the artificial dataset and 0.40 to\n1.12 signal quality improvement for the real-world dataset. The median\nprocessing time for the sound separation of a 10s recording was found to be\n28.3s for NMCF and 342ms for NMF. Because of stable and robust performance, we\nbelieve that our proposed methods are useful to denoise neonatal heart and lung\nsound in a real-world environment.

    "title": "Swin Transformer for Fast MRI",
    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important non-invasive clinical tool\nthat can produce high-resolution and reproducible images. However, a long\nscanning time is required for high-quality MR images, which leads to exhaustion\nand discomfort of patients, inducing more artefacts due to voluntary movements\nof the patients and involuntary physiological movements. To accelerate the\nscanning process, methods by k-space undersampling and deep learning based\nreconstruction have been popularised. This work introduced SwinMR, a novel Swin\ntransformer based method for fast MRI reconstruction. The whole network\nconsisted of an input module (IM), a feature extraction module (FEM) and an\noutput module (OM). The IM and OM were 2D convolutional layers and the FEM was\ncomposed of a cascaded of residual Swin transformer blocks (RSTBs) and 2D\nconvolutional layers. The RSTB consisted of a series of Swin transformer layers\n(STLs). The shifted windows multi-head self-attention (W-MSA/SW-MSA) of STL was\nperformed in shifted windows rather than the multi-head self-attention (MSA) of\nthe original transformer in the whole image space. A novel multi-channel loss\nwas proposed by using the sensitivity maps, which was proved to reserve more\ntextures and details. We performed a series of comparative studies and ablation\nstudies in the Calgary-Campinas public brain MR dataset and conducted a\ndownstream segmentation experiment in the Multi-modal Brain Tumour Segmentation\nChallenge 2017 dataset. The results demonstrate our SwinMR achieved\nhigh-quality reconstruction compared with other benchmark methods, and it shows\ngreat robustness with different undersampling masks, under noise interruption\nand on different datasets.

    "abstract": "The filtering equations govern the evolution of the conditional distribution\nof a signal process given partial, and possibly noisy, observations arriving\nsequentially in time. Their numerical approximation plays a central role in\nmany real-life applications, including numerical weather prediction, finance\nand engineering. One of the classical approaches to approximate the solution of\nthe filtering equations is to use a PDE inspired method, called the\nsplitting-up method, initiated by Gyongy, Krylov, LeGland, among other\ncontributors. This method, and other PDE based approaches, have particular\napplicability for solving low-dimensional problems. In this work we combine\nthis method with a neural network representation. The new methodology is used\nto produce an approximation of the unnormalised conditional distribution of the\nsignal process. We further develop a recursive normalisation procedure to\nrecover the normalised conditional distribution of the signal process. The new\nscheme can be iterated over multiple time steps whilst keeping its asymptotic\nunbiasedness property intact.\nWe test the neural network approximations with numerical approximation\nresults for the Kalman and Benes filter.",

    "abstract": "As a result of the identification of 'identity' and 'indistinguishability'\nand strong experimental evidence for the presence of the associated\nBose-Einstein statistics in human cognition and language, we argued in previous\nwork for an extension of the research domain of quantum cognition. In addition\nto quantum complex vector spaces and quantum probability models, we showed that\nquantization itself, with words as quanta, is relevant and potentially\nimportant to human cognition. In the present work, we build on this result, and\nintroduce a powerful radiation quantization scheme for human cognition. We show\nthat the lack of independence of the Bose-Einstein statistics compared to the\nMaxwell-Boltzmann statistics can be explained by the presence of a 'meaning\ndynamics', which causes words to be attracted to the same words. And so words\nclump together in the same states, a phenomenon well known for photons in the\nearly years of quantum mechanics, leading to fierce disagreements between\nPlanck and Einstein. Using a simple example, we introduce all the elements to\nget a better and detailed view of this 'meaning dynamics', such as micro and\nmacro states, and Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac numbers and\nweights, and compare this example and its graphs, with the radiation\nquantization scheme of a Winnie the Pooh story, also with its graphs. By\nconnecting a concept directly to human experience, we show that entanglement is\na necessity for preserving the 'meaning dynamics' we identified, and it becomes\nclear in what way Fermi-Dirac addresses human memory. There, in spaces with\ninternal parameters identical words can nevertheless be assigned different\nstates.",

Their inference is often challenged by the\nfact that the training data comprises only the outcome for the administered\ntreatment, and not for alternative treatments (the so-called counterfactual\noutcomes). Several methods were suggested for this scenario based on\nobservational data, i.e.~data where the intervention was not applied randomly,\nfor both continuous and binary outcome variables. However, patient outcome is\noften recorded in terms of time-to-event data, comprising right-censored event\ntimes if an event does not occur within the observation period. Albeit their\nenormous importance, time-to-event data is rarely used for treatment\noptimization.\nWe suggest an approach named BITES (Balanced Individual Treatment Effect for\nSurvival data), which combines a treatment-specific semi-parametric Cox loss\nwith a treatment-balanced deep neural network; i.e.~we regularize differences\nbetween treated and non-treated patients using Integral Probability Metrics\n(IPM). We show in simulation studies that this approach outperforms the state\nof the art. Further, we demonstrate in an application to a cohort of breast\ncancer patients that hormone treatment can be optimized based on six routine\nparameters.

The answer to the MCP is already known for nullity 0 graphs:\nthose on which every initial configuration is solvable.

In permuted\nor unlinked regression we have access to separate unordered data on X and Y, as\nopposed to data on (X,Y)-pairs in usual regression. So far in the literature\nthe case $d=1$ has received attention, see e.g., the recent papers by Rigollet\nand Weed [Information & Inference, 8, 619--717] and Balabdaoui et al. [J. Mach.\nLearn. Res., 22(172), 1--60]. In this paper, we consider the general\nmultivariate setting with $d \\geq 1$. We show that the notion of cyclical\nmonotonicity of the regression function is sufficient for identification and\nestimation in the permuted/unlinked regression model. We study permutation\nrecovery in the permuted regression setting and develop a computationally\nefficient and easy-to-use algorithm for denoising based on the Kiefer-Wolfowitz\n[Ann. Math. Statist., 27, 887--906] nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator\nand techniques from the theory of optimal transport. We provide explicit upper\nbounds on the associated mean squared denoising error for Gaussian noise. As in\nprevious work on the case $d = 1$, the permuted/unlinked setting involves slow\n(logarithmic) rates of convergence rooting in the underlying deconvolution\nproblem.
