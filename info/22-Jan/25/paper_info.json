    "abstract": "Many datasets represent a combination of different ways of looking at the\nsame data that lead to different generalizations. For example, a corpus with\nexamples generated by different people may be mixtures of many perspectives and\ncan be viewed with different perspectives by others. It isnt always possible to\nrepresent the viewpoints by a clean separation, in advance, of examples\nrepresenting each viewpoint and train a separate model for each viewpoint. We\nintroduce lensing, a mixed initiative technique to extract lenses or mappings\nbetween machine learned representations and perspectives of human experts, and\nto generate lensed models that afford multiple perspectives of the same\ndataset. We apply lensing for two classes of latent variable models: a mixed\nmembership model, a matrix factorization model in the context of two mental\nhealth applications, and we capture and imbue the perspectives of clinical\npsychologists into these models. Our work shows the benefits of the machine\nlearning practitioner formally incorporating the perspective of a knowledgeable\ndomain expert into their models rather than estimating unlensed models\nthemselves in isolation.",

    "abstract": "Answering complex questions about textual narratives requires reasoning over\nboth stated context and the world knowledge that underlies it. However,\npretrained language models (LM), the foundation of most modern QA systems, do\nnot robustly represent latent relationships between concepts, which is\nnecessary for reasoning. While knowledge graphs (KG) are often used to augment\nLMs with structured representations of world knowledge, it remains an open\nquestion how to effectively fuse and reason over the KG representations and the\nlanguage context, which provides situational constraints and nuances. In this\nwork, we propose GreaseLM, a new model that fuses encoded representations from\npretrained LMs and graph neural networks over multiple layers of modality\ninteraction operations. Information from both modalities propagates to the\nother, allowing language context representations to be grounded by structured\nworld knowledge, and allowing linguistic nuances (e.g., negation, hedging) in\nthe context to inform the graph representations of knowledge. Our results on\nthree benchmarks in the commonsense reasoning (i.e., CommonsenseQA, OpenbookQA)\nand medical question answering (i.e., MedQA-USMLE) domains demonstrate that\nGreaseLM can more reliably answer questions that require reasoning over both\nsituational constraints and structured knowledge, even outperforming models 8x\nlarger.",

In this paper, we propose a\nmutual discriminative knowledge distillation framework to transfer a\nvideo-based richer representation to an image based representation more\neffectively. Specifically, we propose the triplet contrast loss (TCL), a novel\nloss designed for KD. During the KD process, the TCL loss transfers the local\nstructure, exploits the higher order information, and mitigates the\nmisalignment of the heterogeneous output of teacher and student networks.\nCompared with other losses for KD, the proposed TCL loss selectively transfers\nthe local discriminative features from teacher to student, making it effective\nin the ReID. Besides the TCL loss, we adopt mutual learning to regularize both\nthe teacher and student networks training. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method on the MARS, DukeMTMC-VideoReID and VeRi-776\nbenchmarks.",

ICE\nprovides real-time observation of anatomy and devices, while enabling direct\nmonitoring of potential complications. In single operator settings, the\nphysician needs to switch back-and-forth between the ICE catheter and therapy\ndevice, making continuous ICE support impossible. Two operators setup are\ntherefore sometimes implemented, with the challenge of increase room occupation\nand cost. Two operator setups are sometimes implemented, but increase\nprocedural costs and room occupation.\nMethods: ICE catheter robotic control system is developed with automated\ncatheter tip repositioning (i.e. view recovery) method, which can reproduce\nimportant views previously navigated to and saved by the user. The performance\nof the proposed method is demonstrated and evaluated in a combination of heart\nphantom and animal experiments.\nResults: Automated ICE view recovery achieved catheter tip position accuracy\nof 2.09 +/-0.90 mm and catheter image orientation accuracy of 3.93 +/- 2.07\ndegree in animal studies, and 0.67 +/- 0.79 mm and 0.37 +/- 0.19 degree in\nheart phantom studies, respectively. Our proposed method is also successfully\nused during transeptal puncture in animals without complications, showing the\npossibility for fluoro-less transeptal puncture with ICE catheter robot.\nConclusion: Robotic ICE imaging has the potential to provide precise and\nreproducible anatomical views, which can reduce overall execution time, labor\nburden of procedures, and x-ray usage for a range of cardiac procedures.\nKeywords: Automated View Recovery, Path Planning, Intra-cardiac\nechocardiography (ICE), Catheter, Tendon-driven manipulator, Cardiac Imaging",

Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents\noften struggle to learn such complex tasks due to the long time horizons and\nsparse rewards. To address this problem, we present Compositional Design of\nEnvironments (CoDE), which trains a Generator agent to automatically build a\nseries of compositional tasks tailored to the RL agent's current skill level.\nThis automatic curriculum not only enables the agent to learn more complex\ntasks than it could have otherwise, but also selects tasks where the agent's\nperformance is weak, enhancing its robustness and ability to generalize\nzero-shot to unseen tasks at test-time. We analyze why current environment\ngeneration techniques are insufficient for the problem of generating\ncompositional tasks, and propose a new algorithm that addresses these issues.\nOur results assess learning and generalization across multiple compositional\ntasks, including the real-world problem of learning to navigate and interact\nwith web pages.

    "abstract": "Fixed-point fast sweeping methods are a class of explicit iterative methods\ndeveloped in the literature to efficiently solve steady state solutions of\nhyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). As other types of fast\nsweeping schemes, fixed-point fast sweeping methods use the Gauss-Seidel\niterations and alternating sweeping strategy to cover characteristics of\nhyperbolic PDEs in a certain direction simultaneously in each sweeping order.\nThe resulting iterative schemes have fast convergence rate to steady state\nsolutions. Moreover, an advantage of fixed-point fast sweeping methods over\nother types of fast sweeping methods is that they are explicit and do not\ninvolve inverse operation of any nonlinear local system. Hence they are robust\nand flexible, and have been combined with high order accurate weighted\nessentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes to solve various hyperbolic PDEs in\nthe literature. For multidimensional nonlinear problems, high order fixed-point\nfast sweeping WENO methods still require quite large amount of computational\ncosts. In this technical note, we apply sparse-grid techniques, an effective\napproximation tool for multidimensional problems, to fixed-point fast sweeping\nWENO method for reducing its computational costs. Here we focus on a robust\nRunge-Kutta (RK) type fixed-point fast sweeping WENO scheme with third order\naccuracy (Zhang et al. 2006 [33]), for solving Eikonal equations, an important\nclass of static Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) equations. Numerical experiments on\nsolving multidimensional Eikonal equations and a more general static H-J\nequation are performed to show that the sparse grid computations of the\nfixed-point fast sweeping WENO scheme achieve large savings of CPU times on\nrefined meshes, and at the same time maintain comparable accuracy and\nresolution with those on corresponding regular single grids.",

The motivation is\nthat the size and sparsity of the workloads heavily influence which\narchitecture is best for memory and computation efficiency. To satisfy the\ngrowing demand of efficient computations across a spectrum of workloads on\nlarge data centers, we propose deploying a flexible 'heterogeneous'\naccelerator, which contains many 'sub-accelerators' (smaller specialized\naccelerators) working together. To this end, we propose: (1) HARD TACO, a quick\nand productive C++ to RTL design flow to generate many types of\nsub-accelerators for sparse and dense computations for fair design-space\nexploration, (2) AESPA, a heterogeneous sparse accelerator design template\nconstructed with the sub-accelerators generated from HARD TACO, and (3) a suite\nof scheduling strategies to map tensor kernels onto heterogeneous sparse\naccelerators with high efficiency and utilization.

    "abstract": "In recent years, hyperspectral image (HSI) classification based on generative\nadversarial networks (GAN) has achieved great progress. GAN-based\nclassification methods can mitigate the limited training sample dilemma to some\nextent. However, several studies have pointed out that existing GAN-based HSI\nclassification methods are heavily affected by the imbalanced training data\nproblem. The discriminator in GAN always contradicts itself and tries to\nassociate fake labels to the minority-class samples, and thus impair the\nclassification performance. Another critical issue is the mode collapse in\nGAN-based methods. The generator is only capable of producing samples within a\nnarrow scope of the data space, which severely hinders the advancement of\nGAN-based HSI classification methods. In this paper, we proposed an Adaptive\nDropBlock-enhanced Generative Adversarial Networks (ADGAN) for HSI\nclassification. First, to solve the imbalanced training data problem, we adjust\nthe discriminator to be a single classifier, and it will not contradict itself.\nSecond, an adaptive DropBlock (AdapDrop) is proposed as a regularization method\nemployed in the generator and discriminator to alleviate the mode collapse\nissue. The AdapDrop generated drop masks with adaptive shapes instead of a\nfixed size region, and it alleviates the limitations of DropBlock in dealing\nwith ground objects with various shapes. Experimental results on three HSI\ndatasets demonstrated that the proposed ADGAN achieved superior performance\nover state-of-the-art GAN-based methods.

In this paper, we propose an RGBT tracker which\ntakes spatio-temporal clues into account for robust appearance model learning,\nand simultaneously, constructs an adaptive fusion sub-network for cross-modal\ninteractions. Unlike most existing RGBT trackers that implement object tracking\ntasks with only spatial information included, temporal information is further\nconsidered in this method. Specifically, different from traditional Siamese\ntrackers, which only obtain one search image during the process of picking up\ntemplate-search image pairs, an extra search sample adjacent to the original\none is selected to predict the temporal transformation, resulting in improved\nrobustness of tracking performance.As for multi-modal tracking, constrained to\nthe limited RGBT datasets, the adaptive fusion sub-network is appended to our\nmethod at the decision level to reflect the complementary characteristics\ncontained in two modalities. To design a thermal infrared assisted RGB tracker,\nthe outputs of the classification head from the TIR modality are taken into\nconsideration before the residual connection from the RGB modality.

The adoption of millimeter wave\n(mmWave) paths in 5th Generation (5G) networks and Wireless Local Area Networks\n(WLANs) introduces time-varying network conditions, under which the existing\nschedulers struggle to achieve fast and accurate adaptation. In this paper, we\npropose FALCON, a learning-based multipath scheduler that can adapt fast and\naccurately to time-varying network conditions. FALCON builds on the idea of\nmeta-learning where offline learning is used to create a set of meta-models\nthat represent coarse-grained network conditions, and online learning is used\nto bootstrap a specific model for the current fine-grained network conditions\ntowards deriving the scheduling policy to deal with such conditions. Using\ntrace-driven emulation experiments, we demonstrate FALCON outperforms the best\nstate-of-the-art scheduler by up to 19.3% and 23.6% in static and mobile\nnetworks, respectively. Furthermore, we show FALCON is quite flexible to work\nwith different types of applications such as bulk transfer and web services.\nMoreover, we observe FALCON has a much faster adaptation time compared to all\nthe other learning-based schedulers, reaching almost an 8-fold speedup compared\nto the best of them. Finally, we have validated the emulation results in\nreal-world settings illustrating that FALCON adapts well to the dynamicity of\nreal networks, consistently outperforming all other schedulers.",

    "title": "Parallel Rectangle Flip Attack: A Query-based Black-box Attack against  Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Object detection has been widely used in many safety-critical tasks, such as\nautonomous driving. However, its vulnerability to adversarial examples has not\nbeen sufficiently studied, especially under the practical scenario of black-box\nattacks, where the attacker can only access the query feedback of predicted\nbounding-boxes and top-1 scores returned by the attacked model. Compared with\nblack-box attack to image classification, there are two main challenges in\nblack-box attack to detection. Firstly, even if one bounding-box is\nsuccessfully attacked, another sub-optimal bounding-box may be detected near\nthe attacked bounding-box. Secondly, there are multiple bounding-boxes, leading\nto very high attack cost. To address these challenges, we propose a Parallel\nRectangle Flip Attack (PRFA) via random search. We explain the difference\nbetween our method with other attacks in Fig.~\\ref{fig1}. Specifically, we\ngenerate perturbations in each rectangle patch to avoid sub-optimal detection\nnear the attacked region. Besides, utilizing the observation that adversarial\nperturbations mainly locate around objects' contours and critical points under\nwhite-box attacks, the search space of attacked rectangles is reduced to\nimprove the attack efficiency. Moreover, we develop a parallel mechanism of\nattacking multiple rectangles simultaneously to further accelerate the attack\nprocess. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively and\nefficiently attack various popular object detectors, including anchor-based and\nanchor-free, and generate transferable adversarial examples.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning has achieved significant success in the\nChinese word segmentation (CWS) task. Most of these methods improve the\nperformance of CWS by leveraging external information, e.g., words, sub-words,\nsyntax. However, existing approaches fail to effectively integrate the\nmulti-level linguistic information and also ignore the structural feature of\nthe external information. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a framework to\nimprove CWS, named HGNSeg. It exploits multi-level external information\nsufficiently with the pre-trained language model and heterogeneous graph neural\nnetwork. The experimental results on six benchmark datasets (e.g., Bakeoff\n2005, Bakeoff 2008) validate that our approach can effectively improve the\nperformance of Chinese word segmentation.

Unfortunately, the large amount of interactive\nsample labeling efforts has dramatically hindered the application of deep\nlearning methods, especially for 3D modeling tasks, which require heterogeneous\nsamples. To alleviate the work of data annotation for learned 3D modeling of\nfa\\c{c}ades, this paper proposed a semi-supervised adversarial recognition\nstrategy embedded in inverse procedural modeling. Beginning with textured LOD-2\n(Level-of-Details) models, we use the classical convolutional neural networks\nto recognize the types and estimate the parameters of windows from image\npatches. The window types and parameters are then assembled into procedural\ngrammar. A simple procedural engine is built inside an existing 3D modeling\nsoftware, producing fine-grained window geometries. To obtain a useful model\nfrom a few labeled samples, we leverage the generative adversarial network to\ntrain the feature extractor in a semi-supervised manner. The adversarial\ntraining strategy can also exploit unlabeled data to make the training phase\nmore stable. Experiments using publicly available fa\\c{c}ade image datasets\nreveal that the proposed training strategy can obtain about 10% improvement in\nclassification accuracy and 50% improvement in parameter estimation under the\nsame network structure. In addition, performance gains are more pronounced when\ntesting against unseen data featuring different fa\\c{c}ade styles.",

Several\nrisk factors, such as post-transplant illnesses, new malignancies, and even\norgan damage, can impair long-term survival.

In this study,\nan efficient survival classification model is presented in a comprehensive\nmanner, incorporating the Chi-squared feature selection method to address the\ndimensionality problem and Hyper Parameter Optimization (HPO) to increase\naccuracy. A synthetic dataset is generated by imputing the missing values,\ntransforming the data using dummy variable encoding, and compressing the\ndataset from 59 features to the 11 most correlated features using Chi-squared\nfeature selection. The dataset was split into train and test sets at a ratio of\n80:20, and the hyperparameters were optimized using Grid Search\nCross-Validation. Several supervised ML methods were trained in this regard,\nlike Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors,\nGradient Boosting Classifier, Ada Boost, and XG Boost. The simulations have\nbeen performed for both the default and optimized hyperparameters by using the\noriginal and reduced synthetic dataset.

    "abstract": "The problem of $H_{\\infty}$ filtering for attitude estimation using rotation\nmatrices and vector measurements is studied. Starting from a storage function\non the Special Orthogonal Group $SO(3)$, a dissipation inequality is\nconsidered, and a deterministic nonlinear $H_{\\infty}$ filter is derived which\nrespects a given upper bound $\\gamma$ on the energy gain from exogenous\ndisturbances and initial estimation errors to a generalized estimation error.\nThe results are valid for all estimation errors which correspond to an angular\nerror of less than $\\pi/2$ radians in terms of the axis-angle representation.\nThe approach builds on earlier results on attitude estimation, in particular\nnonlinear $H_{\\infty}$ filtering using quaternions, and proposes a novel filter\ndeveloped directly on $SO(3)$. The proposed filter employs the same innovation\nterm as the Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF), as well as a matrix\ngain updated in accordance with a Riccati-type gain update equation. However,\nin contrast to the MEKF, the proposed filter has an additional tuning gain,\n$\\gamma$, which enables it to be more aggressive during transients. The filter\nis simulated for different conditions, and the results are compared with those\nobtained using the continuous-time quaternion MEKF and the Geometric\nApproximate Minimum Energy (GAME) filter. Simulations indicate competitive\nperformance. In particular, the GAME filter has the best transient performance,\nfollowed by the proposed $H_{\\infty}$ filter and the quaternion MEKF. All three\nfilters have similar steady-state performance. Therefore, the proposed filter\ncan be seen as a MEKF variant which achieves better transient performance\nwithout significant degradation in steady-state noise rejection.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the performance of an RIS-aided wireless\ncommunication system subject to outdated channel state information that may\noperate in both the near- and far-field regions. In particular, we take two RIS\ndeployment strategies into consideration: (i) the centralized deployment, where\nall the reflecting elements are installed on a single RIS and (ii) the\ndistributed deployment, where the same number of reflecting elements are placed\non multiple RISs. For both deployment strategies, we derive accurate\nclosed-form approximations for the ergodic capacity, and we introduce tight\nupper and lower bounds for the ergodic capacity to obtain useful design\ninsights. From this analysis, we unveil that an increase of the transmit power,\nthe Rician-K factor, the accuracy of the channel state information and the\nnumber of reflecting elements help improve the system performance. Moreover, we\nprove that the centralized RIS-aided deployment may achieve a higher ergodic\ncapacity as compared with the distributed RIS-aided deployment when the RIS is\nlocated near the base station or near the user. In different setups, on the\nother hand, we prove that the distributed deployment outperforms the\ncentralized deployment. Finally, the analytical results are verified by using\nMonte Carlo simulations.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of mental health services are offered through mobile\nsystems, a paradigm called mHealth. Although there is an unprecedented growth\nin the adoption of mHealth systems, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nconcerns about data privacy risks due to security breaches are also increasing.\nWhilst some studies have analyzed mHealth apps from different angles, including\nsecurity, there is relatively little evidence for data privacy issues that may\nexist in mHealth apps used for mental health services, whose recipients can be\nparticularly vulnerable. This paper reports an empirical study aimed at\nsystematically identifying and understanding data privacy incorporated in\nmental health apps. We analyzed 27 top-ranked mental health apps from Google\nPlay Store. Our methodology enabled us to perform an in-depth privacy analysis\nof the apps, covering static and dynamic analysis, data sharing behaviour,\nserver-side tests, privacy impact assessment requests, and privacy policy\nevaluation. Furthermore, we mapped the findings to the LINDDUN threat taxonomy,\ndescribing how threats manifest on the studied apps. The findings reveal\nimportant data privacy issues such as unnecessary permissions, insecure\ncryptography implementations, and leaks of personal data and credentials in\nlogs and web requests. There is also a high risk of user profiling as the apps'\ndevelopment do not provide foolproof mechanisms against linkability,\ndetectability and identifiability. Data sharing among third parties and\nadvertisers in the current apps' ecosystem aggravates this situation. Based on\nthe empirical findings of this study, we provide recommendations to be\nconsidered by different stakeholders of mHealth apps in general and apps\ndevelopers in particular. [...]",

    "abstract": "Many prominent smart-contract applications such as payment channels,\nauctions, and voting systems often involve a mechanism in which some party must\nrespond to a challenge or appeal some action within a fixed time limit. This\npattern of challenge-response mechanisms poses great risks if during periods of\nhigh transaction volume, the network becomes congested. In this case fee market\ncompetition can prevent the inclusion of the response in blocks, causing great\nharm. As a result, responders are allowed long periods to submit their response\nand overpay in fees. To overcome these problems and improve challenge-response\nprotocols, we suggest a secure mechanism that detects congestion in blocks and\nadjusts the deadline of the response accordingly. The responder is thus\nguaranteed a deadline extension should congestion arise. We lay theoretical\nfoundations for congestion signals in blockchains and then proceed to analyze\nand discuss possible attacks on the mechanism and evaluate its robustness. Our\nresults show that in Ethereum, using short response deadlines as low as 3\nhours, the protocol has >99% defense rate from attacks even by miners with up\nto 33% of the computational power. Using shorter deadlines such as one hour is\nalso possible with a similar defense rate for attackers with up to 27% of the\npower.",

    "abstract": "The goal of Knowledge Tracing (KT) is to estimate how well students have\nmastered a concept based on their historical learning of related exercises. The\nbenefit of knowledge tracing is that students' learning plans can be better\norganised and adjusted, and interventions can be made when necessary. With the\nrecent rise of deep learning, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) has utilised\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to accomplish this task with some success.\nOther works have attempted to introduce Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and\nredefine the task accordingly to achieve significant improvements. However,\nthese efforts suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: 1) they pay\ntoo much attention to details of the nodes rather than to high-level semantic\ninformation; 2) they struggle to effectively establish spatial associations and\ncomplex structures of the nodes; and 3) they represent either concepts or\nexercises only, without integrating them. Inspired by recent advances in\nself-supervised learning, we propose a Bi-Graph Contrastive Learning based\nKnowledge Tracing (Bi-CLKT) to address these limitations. Specifically, we\ndesign a two-layer contrastive learning scheme based on an\n\"exercise-to-exercise\" (E2E) relational subgraph. It involves node-level\ncontrastive learning of subgraphs to obtain discriminative representations of\nexercises, and graph-level contrastive learning to obtain discriminative\nrepresentations of concepts. Moreover, we designed a joint contrastive loss to\nobtain better representations and hence better prediction performance. Also, we\nexplored two different variants, using RNN and memory-augmented neural networks\nas the prediction layer for comparison to obtain better representations of\nexercises and concepts respectively. Extensive experiments on four real-world\ndatasets show that the proposed Bi-CLKT and its variants outperform other\nbaseline models.",

In this paper, we reason the\nessential limitations of the traditional warping operation to be the limited\nneighborhood and only distance-based interpolation weights. To this end, we\npropose content-aware warping, which adaptively learns the interpolation\nweights for pixels of a relatively large neighborhood from their contextual\ninformation via a lightweight neural network. Based on this learnable warping\nmodule, we propose a new end-to-end learning-based framework for novel view\nsynthesis from two input source views, in which two additional modules, namely\nconfidence-based blending and feature-assistant spatial refinement, are\nnaturally proposed to handle the occlusion issue and capture the spatial\ncorrelation among pixels of the synthesized view, respectively. Besides, we\nalso propose a weight-smoothness loss term to regularize the network.\nExperimental results on structured light field datasets with wide baselines and\nunstructured multi-view datasets show that the proposed method significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually.

We assume that all the radars\nuse same parameters, e.g., chirp duration, chirp slope, cutoff frequency,\nnumber of chirps per packet, etc, and propose and analyze slotted ALOHA and\nCSMA protocols to mitigate narrowband interference. We define a notion of\nthroughput to quantify the performance of the proposed protocols.

We observe that interference probability and throughput\nmay behave differently than in wireless communication networks.

We define a medium\nsensing procedure, referred to as clear channel assessment (CCA), as a part of\nthe proposed CSMA, and also define CCA success and failure events. In CSMA, the\nradars transmit only after a successful CCA.

    "abstract": "One of the most prominent and widely-used blockchain privacy solutions are\nzero-knowledge proof (ZKP) mixers operating on top of smart contract-enabled\nblockchains. ZKP mixers typically advertise their level of privacy through a\nso-called anonymity set size, similar to k-anonymity, where a user hides among\na set of $k$ other users.\nIn reality, however, these anonymity set claims are mostly inaccurate, as we\nfind through empirical measurements of the currently most active ZKP mixers. We\npropose five heuristics that, in combination, can increase the probability that\nan adversary links a withdrawer to the correct depositor on average by 51.94%\n(108.63%) on the most popular Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC)\nmixer, respectively. Our empirical evidence is hence also the first to suggest\na differing privacy-predilection of users on ETH and BSC. We further identify\n105 Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attackers leveraging ZKP mixers as the initial\nfunds and to deposit attack revenue (e.g., from phishing scams, hacking\ncentralized exchanges, and blockchain project attacks).\nState-of-the-art mixers are moreover tightly intertwined with the growing\nDeFi ecosystem by offering ``anonymity mining'' (AM) incentives, i.e., mixer\nusers receive monetary rewards for mixing coins. However, contrary to the\nclaims of related work, we find that AM does not always contribute to improving\nthe quality of an anonymity set size of a mixer, because AM tends to attract\nprivacy-ignorant users naively reusing addresses.",

    "abstract": "Several performance measures can be used for evaluating classification\nresults: accuracy, F-measure, and many others. Can we say that some of them are\nbetter than others, or, ideally, choose one measure that is best in all\nsituations? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic analysis of\nclassification performance measures: we formally define a list of desirable\nproperties and theoretically analyze which measures satisfy which properties.\nWe also prove an impossibility theorem: some desirable properties cannot be\nsimultaneously satisfied. Finally, we propose a new family of measures\nsatisfying all desirable properties except one. This family includes the\nMatthews Correlation Coefficient and a so-called Symmetric Balanced Accuracy\nthat was not previously used in classification literature. We believe that our\nsystematic approach gives an important tool to practitioners for adequately\nevaluating classification results.",

    "abstract": "Counterfactual explanations (CEs) are a powerful means for understanding how\ndecisions made by algorithms can be changed. Researchers have proposed a number\nof desiderata that CEs should meet to be practically useful, such as requiring\nminimal effort to enact, or complying with causal models. We consider a further\naspect to improve the usability of CEs: robustness to adverse perturbations,\nwhich may naturally happen due to unfortunate circumstances. Since CEs\ntypically prescribe a sparse form of intervention (i.e., only a subset of the\nfeatures should be changed), we provide two definitions of robustness, which\nconcern, respectively, the features to change and to keep as they are. These\ndefinitions are workable in that they can be incorporated as penalty terms in\nthe loss functions that are used for discovering CEs. To experiment with the\nproposed definitions of robustness, we create and release code where five data\nsets (commonly used in the field of fair and explainable machine learning) have\nbeen enriched with feature-specific annotations that can be used to sample\nmeaningful perturbations. Our experiments show that CEs are often not robust\nand, if adverse perturbations take place, the intervention they prescribe may\nrequire a much larger cost than anticipated, or even become impossible.\nHowever, accounting for robustness in the search process, which can be done\nrather easily, allows discovering robust CEs systematically. Robust CEs are\nresilient to adverse perturbations: additional intervention to contrast\nperturbations is much less costly than for non-robust CEs.

    "abstract": "Location based services, already popular with end users, are now inevitably\nbecoming part of new wireless infrastructures and emerging business processes.\nThe increasingly popular Deep Learning (DL) artificial intelligence methods\nperform very well in wireless fingerprinting localization based on extensive\nindoor radio measurement data. However, with the increasing complexity these\nmethods become computationally very intensive and energy hungry, both for their\ntraining and subsequent operation. Considering only mobile users, estimated to\nexceed 7.4billion by the end of 2025, and assuming that the networks serving\nthese users will need to perform only one localization per user per hour on\naverage, the machine learning models used for the calculation would need to\nperform 65*10^12 predictions per year. Add to this equation tens of billions of\nother connected devices and applications that rely heavily on more frequent\nlocation updates, and it becomes apparent that localization will contribute\nsignificantly to carbon emissions unless more energy-efficient models are\ndeveloped and used. This motivated our work on a new DL-based architecture for\nindoor localization that is more energy efficient compared to related\nstate-of-the-art approaches while showing only marginal performance\ndegradation. A detailed performance evaluation shows that the proposed model\nproducesonly 58 % of the carbon footprint while maintaining 98.7 % of the\noverall performance compared to state of the art model external to our group.\nAdditionally, we elaborate on a methodology to calculate the complexity of the\nDL model and thus the CO2 footprint during its training and operation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the channel access problem in a dynamic wireless\nenvironment via meta-reinforcement learning. Spectrum is a scarce resource in\nwireless communications, especially with the dramatic increase in the number of\ndevices in networks. Recently, inspired by the success of deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL), extensive studies have been conducted in addressing wireless\nresource allocation problems via DRL. However, training DRL algorithms usually\nrequires a massive amount of data collected from the environment for each\nspecific task and the well-trained model may fail if there is a small variation\nin the environment. In this work, in order to address these challenges, we\npropose a meta-DRL framework that incorporates the method of Model-Agnostic\nMeta-Learning (MAML). In the proposed framework, we train a common\ninitialization for similar channel selection tasks. From the initialization, we\nshow that only a few gradient descents are required for adapting to different\ntasks drawn from the same distribution.

    "abstract": "Mobile edge computing has become an effective and fundamental paradigm for\nfuturistic autonomous vehicles to offload computing tasks. However, due to the\nhigh mobility of vehicles, the dynamics of the wireless conditions, and the\nuncertainty of the arrival computing tasks, it is difficult for a single\nvehicle to determine the optimal offloading strategy. In this paper, we propose\na Digital Twin (DT) empowered task offloading framework for Internet of\nVehicles. As a software agent residing in the cloud, a DT can obtain both\nglobal network information by using communications among DTs, and historical\ninformation of a vehicle by using the communications within the twin. The\nglobal network information and historical vehicular information can\nsignificantly facilitate the offloading. In specific, to preserve the precious\ncomputing resource at different levels for most appropriate computing tasks, we\nintegrate a learning scheme based on the prediction of futuristic computing\ntasks in DT. Accordingly, we model the offloading scheduling process as a\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP) to minimize the long-term cost in terms of a\ntrade off between task latency, energy consumption, and renting cost of clouds.\nSimulation results demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively find the\noptimal offloading strategy, as well as achieve the fast convergence speed and\nhigh performance, compared with other existing approaches.",

This method analyzes lightweight thumbnail\ncontainers (LTC) using computational resources of the client device to\nrecognize personalized events from full-length sports videos. In addition,\ninstead of processing the entire video, small video segments are processed to\ngenerate artistic media. This makes the proposed approach more computationally\nefficient compared to the baseline approaches that create artistic media using\nthe entire video. The proposed method retrieves and uses thumbnail containers\nand video segments, which reduces the required transmission bandwidth as well\nas the amount of locally stored data used during artistic media generation.\nWhen extensive experiments were conducted on the Nvidia Jetson TX2, the\ncomputational complexity of the proposed method was 3.57 times lower than that\nof the SoA method. In the qualitative assessment, GIFs generated using the\nproposed method received 1.02 higher overall ratings compared to the SoA\nmethod.

Here we focus on a recently proposed RSR method termed\nDual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) approach, which aims to recover a basis\nof the orthogonal complement of the subspace and is amenable to handling\nsubspaces of high relative dimension. Prior work has shown that DPCP can\nprovably recover the correct subspace in the presence of outliers, as long as\nthe true dimension of the subspace is known. We show that DPCP can provably\nsolve RSR problems in the {\\it unknown} subspace dimension regime, as long as\northogonality constraints -- adopted in previous DPCP formulations -- are\nrelaxed and random initialization is used instead of spectral one. Namely, we\npropose a very simple algorithm based on running multiple instances of a\nprojected sub-gradient descent method (PSGM), with each problem instance\nseeking to find one vector in the null space of the subspace. We theoretically\nprove that under mild conditions this approach will succeed with high\nprobability. In particular, we show that 1) all of the problem instances will\nconverge to a vector in the nullspace of the subspace and 2) the ensemble of\nproblem instance solutions will be sufficiently diverse to fully span the\nnullspace of the subspace thus also revealing its true unknown codimension.

Each module consists of a moderate number of\narray elements and the modules are regularly arranged with the inter-module\nspace typically much larger than signal wavelength to cater to the actual\nmounting structure. We study the mathematical modelling and conduct the\nperformance analysis for modular XL-array communications, by considering the\nnon-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) characteristic that is more suitable than the\nconventional uniform plane wave (UPW) assumption for physically large arrays. A\nclosed-form expression is derived for the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nin terms of the geometries of the modular XL-array, including the total array\nsize and module separation, as well as the user's location. The asymptotic SNR\nscaling law is revealed as the size of modular array goes to infinity.\nFurthermore, we show that the developed modelling and performance analysis\ninclude the existing results for collocated XL-array or far-field UPW\nassumption as special cases.

In this work, we present Mazi,\nan algorithm that jointly learns the hierarchical community structure and the\nnode representations of the graph in an unsupervised fashion. To account for\nthe structure in the node representations, Mazi generates node representations\nat each level of the hierarchy, and utilizes them to influence the node\nrepresentations of the original graph. Further, the communities at each level\nare discovered by simultaneously maximizing the modularity metric and\nminimizing the distance between the representations of a node and its\ncommunity.

    "abstract": "The current outbreak of a coronavirus, has quickly escalated to become a\nserious global problem that has now been declared a Public Health Emergency of\nInternational Concern by the World Health Organization. Infectious diseases\nknow no borders, so when it comes to controlling outbreaks, timing is\nabsolutely essential. It is so important to detect threats as early as\npossible, before they spread. After a first successful DiCOVA challenge, the\norganisers released second DiCOVA challenge with the aim of diagnosing COVID-19\nthrough the use of breath, cough and speech audio samples. This work presents\nthe details of the automatic system for COVID-19 detection using breath, cough\nand speech recordings. We developed different front-end auditory acoustic\nfeatures along with a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM) as\nclassifier. The results are promising and have demonstrated the high\ncomplementary behaviour among the auditory acoustic features in the Breathing,\nCough and Speech tracks giving an AUC of 86.60% on the test set.",

    "abstract": "Neural network based planners have shown great promises in improving\nperformance and task success rate in autonomous driving. However, it is very\nchallenging to ensure safety of the system with learning enabled components,\nespecially in dense and highly interactive traffic environments. In this work,\nwe propose a neural network based lane changing planner framework that can\nensure safety while sustaining system efficiency. To prevent too conservative\nplanning, we assess the aggressiveness and identify the driving behavior of\nsurrounding vehicles, then adapt the planned trajectory for the ego vehicle\naccordingly. The ego vehicle can proceed to change lanes if a safe evasion\ntrajectory exists even in the worst case, otherwise, it can hesitate around\ncurrent lateral position or return back to the original lane. We also\nquantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our planner design and its\nadvantage over other baselines through extensive simulations with diverse and\ncomprehensive experimental settings.",

    "abstract": "Study reproducibility and generalizability of results to broadly inclusive\npopulations is crucial in any research. Previous meta-analyses in HRI have\nfocused on the consistency of reported information from papers in various\ncategories. However, members of the HRI community have noted that much of the\ninformation needed for reproducible and generalizable studies is not found in\npublished papers. We address this issue by surveying the reported study\nmetadata over the past three years (2019 through 2021) of the main proceedings\nof the International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) as well as\nalt.HRI. Based on the analysis results, we propose a set of recommendations for\nthe HRI community that follow the longer-standing reporting guidelines from\nhuman-computer interaction (HCI), psychology, and other fields most related to\nHRI. Finally, we examine three key areas for user study reproducibility:\nrecruitment details, participant compensation, and participant gender. We find\na lack of reporting within each of these study metadata categories: of the 236\nstudies, 139 studies failed to report recruitment method, 118 studies failed to\nreport compensation, and 62 studies failed to report gender data. This analysis\ntherefore provides guidance about specific types of needed reporting\nimprovements for HRI.",

    "abstract": "More and more HPC applications require fast and effective compression\ntechniques to handle large volumes of data in storage and transmission. Not\nonly do these applications need to compress the data effectively during\nsimulation, but they also need to perform decompression efficiently for post\nhoc analysis. SZ is an error-bounded lossy compressor for scientific data, and\ncuSZ is a version of SZ designed to take advantage of the GPU's power. At\npresent, cuSZ's compression performance has been optimized significantly while\nits decompression still suffers considerably lower performance because of its\nsophisticated lossless compression step -- a customized Huffman decoding. In\nthis work, we aim to significantly improve the Huffman decoding performance for\ncuSZ, thus improving the overall decompression performance in turn. To this\nend, we first investigate two state-of-the-art GPU Huffman decoders in depth.\nThen, we propose a deep architectural optimization for both algorithms.\nSpecifically, we take full advantage of CUDA GPU architectures by using shared\nmemory on decoding/writing phases, online tuning the amount of shared memory to\nuse, improving memory access patterns, and reducing warp divergence. Finally,\nwe evaluate our optimized decoders on an Nvidia V100 GPU using eight\nrepresentative scientific datasets. Our new decoding solution obtains an\naverage speedup of 3.64X over cuSZ's Huffman decoder and improves its overall\ndecompression performance by 2.43X on average.",

    "abstract": "Controllable text generation concerns two fundamental tasks of wide\napplications, namely generating text of given attributes (i.e.,\nattribute-conditional generation), and minimally editing existing text to\npossess desired attributes (i.e., text attribute transfer). Extensive prior\nwork has largely studied the two problems separately, and developed different\nconditional models which, however, are prone to producing biased text (e.g.,\nvarious gender stereotypes). This paper proposes to formulate controllable text\ngeneration from a principled causal perspective which models the two tasks with\na unified framework. A direct advantage of the causal formulation is the use of\nrich causality tools to mitigate generation biases and improve control. We\ntreat the two tasks as interventional and counterfactual causal inference based\non a structural causal model, respectively. We then apply the framework to the\nchallenging practical setting where confounding factors (that induce spurious\ncorrelations) are observable only on a small fraction of data.

However, not everything that we gaze upon, is\nsomething we want to interact with; this is known as the Midas Touch problem\nfor gaze interfaces. To overcome the Midas Touch problem, present interfaces\ntend not to rely on natural gaze cues, but rather use dwell time or gaze\ngestures. Here we present an entirely data-driven approach to decode human\nintention for object manipulation tasks based solely on natural gaze cues. We\nrun data collection experiments where 16 participants are given manipulation\nand inspection tasks to be performed on various objects on a table in front of\nthem. The subjects' eye movements are recorded using wearable eye-trackers\nallowing the participants to freely move their head and gaze upon the scene. We\nuse our Semantic Fovea, a convolutional neural network model to obtain the\nobjects in the scene and their relation to gaze traces at every frame. We then\nevaluate the data and examine several ways to model the classification task for\nintention prediction. Our evaluation shows that intention prediction is not a\nnaive result of the data, but rather relies on non-linear temporal processing\nof gaze cues. We model the task as a time series classification problem and\ndesign a bidirectional Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network architecture to\ndecode intentions. Our results show that we can decode human intention of\nmotion purely from natural gaze cues and object relative position, with\n$91.9\\%$ accuracy. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of natural gaze as a\nZero-UI interface for human-machine interaction, i.e., users will only need to\nact naturally, and do not need to interact with the interface itself or deviate\nfrom their natural eye movement patterns.",

It has been observed\nthat networks often learn background textures which are not relevant to the\nobject of interest. In turn this makes the networks susceptible to variations\nand changes in the background which negatively affect their performance. We\npropose a new two-step training procedure called \\textit{split training} to\nreduce this bias in CNNs on both Infrared imagery and RGB data. Our split\ntraining procedure has two steps: using MSE loss first train the layers of the\nnetwork on images with background to match the activations of the same network\nwhen it is trained using images without background; then with these layers\nfrozen, train the rest of the network with cross-entropy loss to classify the\nobjects.

However, studying the RL-based\napproaches from the adversary's perspective has received little attention.\nAdditionally, RL-based approaches in an anti-adversary or adversarial paradigm\nmostly consider single-channel communication (either channel selection or\nsingle channel power control), while multi-channel communication is more common\nin practice. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent adversary system (MAAS)\nfor modeling and analyzing adversaries in a wireless communication scenario by\ncareful design of the reward function under realistic communication scenarios.\nIn particular, by modeling the adversaries as learning agents, we show that the\nproposed MAAS is able to successfully choose the transmitted channel(s) and\ntheir respective allocated power(s) without any prior knowledge of the sender\nstrategy. Compared to the single-agent adversary (SAA), multi-agents in MAAS\ncan achieve significant reduction in signal-to-noise ratio (SINR) under the\nsame power constraints and partial observability, while providing improved\nstability and a more efficient learning process. Moreover, through empirical\nstudies we show that the results in simulation are close to the ones in\ncommunication in reality, a conclusion that is pivotal to the validity of\nperformance of agents evaluated in simulations.",

    "title": "External Stability Auditing to Test the Validity of Personality  Prediction in AI Hiring",
    "abstract": "Automated hiring systems are among the fastest-developing of all high-stakes\nAI systems. Among these are algorithmic personality tests that use insights\nfrom psychometric testing, and promise to surface personality traits indicative\nof future success based on job seekers' resumes or social media profiles. We\ninterrogate the validity of such systems using stability of the outputs they\nproduce, noting that reliability is a necessary, but not a sufficient,\ncondition for validity. Our approach is to (a) develop a methodology for an\nexternal audit of stability of predictions made by algorithmic personality\ntests, and (b) instantiate this methodology in an audit of two systems,\nHumantic AI and Crystal. Crucially, rather than challenging or affirming the\nassumptions made in psychometric testing -- that personality is a meaningful\nand measurable construct, and that personality traits are indicative of future\nsuccess on the job -- we frame our methodology around testing the underlying\nassumptions made by the vendors of the algorithmic personality tests\nthemselves.\nIn our audit of Humantic AI and Crystal, we find that both systems show\nsubstantial instability with respect to key facets of measurement, and so\ncannot be considered valid testing instruments. For example, Crystal frequently\ncomputes different personality scores if the same resume is given in PDF vs. in\nraw text format, violating the assumption that the output of an algorithmic\npersonality test is stable across job-irrelevant variations in the input. Among\nother notable findings is evidence of persistent -- and often incorrect -- data\nlinkage by Humantic AI.",

The growth has been especially outstanding in image captioning and\nvideo captioning. However, most of the advancements in video captioning still\ntake place in short videos. In this research, we caption longer videos only by\nusing the keyframes, which are a small subset of the total video frames.\nInstead of processing thousands of frames, only a few frames are processed\ndepending on the number of keyframes. There is a trade-off between the\ncomputation of many frames and the speed of the captioning process.

In addition, we argue that linking images, videos,\nand natural language offers many practical benefits and immediate practical\napplications. From the modeling perspective, instead of designing and staging\nexplicit algorithms to process videos and generate captions in complex\nprocessing pipelines, our contribution lies in designing hybrid deep learning\narchitectures to apply in long videos by captioning video keyframes.

This work seeks to develop a\nbetter understanding of how echo chambers manifest in different discussions\ndealing with different issues over an extended period of time. We explore the\nactivities of two groups of polarised accounts across three Twitter discussions\nin the Australian context. We found Australian Twitter accounts arguing against\nmarriage equality in 2017 were more likely to support the notion that arsonists\nwere the primary cause of the 2019/2020 Australian bushfires, and those\nsupporting marriage equality argued against that arson narrative. We also found\nstrong evidence that the stance people took on marriage equality in 2017 did\nnot predict their political stance in discussions around the Australian federal\nelection two years later.

The success of this task depends on cross-modal\nrepresentation learning that projects both videos and sentences into common\nspaces for semantic similarity computation. In this work, we concentrate on\nvideo representation learning, an essential component for text-to-video\nretrieval. Inspired by the reading strategy of humans, we propose a\nReading-strategy Inspired Visual Representation Learning (RIVRL) to represent\nvideos, which consists of two branches: a previewing branch and an\nintensive-reading branch. The previewing branch is designed to briefly capture\nthe overview information of videos, while the intensive-reading branch is\ndesigned to obtain more in-depth information. Moreover, the intensive-reading\nbranch is aware of the video overview captured by the previewing branch. Such\nholistic information is found to be useful for the intensive-reading branch to\nextract more fine-grained features. Extensive experiments on three datasets are\nconducted, where our model RIVRL achieves a new state-of-the-art on TGIF and\nVATEX.

Most prior works treat partial or full videos as a whole, which\nneglects the semantic consistencies among partial videos of various progress\nlevels due to their large intra-class variances. In contrast, we partition\noriginal partial or full videos to form a series of new partial videos and mine\nthe Action Semantic Consistent Knowledge (ASCK) among these new partial videos\nevolving in arbitrary progress levels. Moreover, a novel Action Semantic\nConsistent learning network (ASCNet) under the teacher-student framework is\nproposed for early action prediction.

Then we build a\nbi-directional fully connected graph for the teacher network and a\nsingle-directional fully connected graph for the student network to model ASCK\namong partial videos. The MSE and MMD losses are incorporated as our\ndistillation loss to further transfer the ASCK from the teacher to the student\nnetwork.

Moreover, we, for the first time, identify\nprimitive degenerate motions for IMU and camera intrinsic calibration.

Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations and real-world experiments are\nperformed to validate both the observability analysis and identified degenerate\nmotions, showing that online self-calibration improves system accuracy and\nrobustness to calibration inaccuracies.

However, building such frameworks is\nchallenging, as a sufficiently large amount of defective training data is often\nnot available and frameworks are required to capture both the temporal and\ncontextual dependencies across different time steps while being robust to\nnoise. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised Attention-based Convolutional\nLong Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) Autoencoder with Dynamic Thresholding\n(ACLAE-DT) framework for anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time\nseries. The framework starts by pre-processing and enriching the data, before\nconstructing feature images to characterize the system statuses across\ndifferent time steps by capturing the inter-correlations between pairs of time\nseries. Afterwards, the constructed feature images are fed into an\nattention-based ConvLSTM autoencoder, which aims to encode the constructed\nfeature images and capture the temporal behavior, followed by decoding the\ncompressed knowledge representation to reconstruct the feature images input.\nThe reconstruction errors are then computed and subjected to a\nstatistical-based, dynamic thresholding mechanism to detect and diagnose the\nanomalies.

To balance the security and\nefficiency issues, three new efforts are done by appropriately integrating\nhomomorphic encryption (HE) and zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive\nargument of knowledge (zk-SNARK) primitives with the CNN testing. First, a CNN\nmodel to be tested is strategically partitioned into a private part kept\nlocally by the model developer, and a public part outsourced to an outside\nserver. Then, the private part runs over HE-protected test data sent by a\ntester and transmits its outputs to the public part for accomplishing\nsubsequent computations of the CNN testing. Second, the correctness of the\nabove CNN testing is enforced by generating zk-SNARK based proofs, with an\nemphasis on optimizing proving overhead for two-dimensional (2-D) convolution\noperations, since the operations dominate the performance bottleneck during\ngenerating proofs. We specifically present a new quadratic matrix programs\n(QMPs)-based arithmetic circuit with a single multiplication gate for\nexpressing 2-D convolution operations between multiple filters and inputs in a\nbatch manner. Third, we aggregate multiple proofs with respect to a same CNN\nmodel but different testers' test data (i.e., different statements) into one\nproof, and ensure that the validity of the aggregated proof implies the\nvalidity of the original multiple proofs. Lastly, our experimental results\ndemonstrate that our QMPs-based zk-SNARK performs nearly 13.9$\\times$faster\nthan the existing QAPs-based zk-SNARK in proving time, and 17.6$\\times$faster\nin Setup time, for high-dimension matrix multiplication.",

It also enables RPC over PCIe such that the users can simply program\nGNNs through a graph semantic library without any knowledge of the underlying\nhardware or storage configurations.\nWe fabricate HolisticGNN's hardware RTL and implement its software on an\nFPGA-based computational SSD (CSSD). Our empirical evaluations show that the\ninference time of HolisticGNN outperforms GNN inference services using\nhigh-performance modern GPUs by 7.1x while reducing energy consumption by\n33.2x, on average.",

In this paper, we develop a novel and solid algorithmic pooling\nframework through the lens of optimal transport. In particular, we demonstrate\nthat most existing pooling methods are equivalent to solving some\nspecializations of an unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) problem. Making the\nparameters of the UOT problem learnable, we unify most existing pooling methods\nin the same framework, and accordingly, propose a generalized pooling layer\ncalled \\textit{UOT-Pooling} for neural networks. Moreover, we implement the\nUOT-Pooling with two different architectures, based on the Sinkhorn scaling\nalgorithm and the Bregman ADMM algorithm, respectively, and study their\nstability and efficiency quantitatively. We test our UOT-Pooling layers in two\napplication scenarios, including multi-instance learning (MIL) and graph\nembedding. For state-of-the-art models of these two tasks, we can improve their\nperformance by replacing conventional pooling layers with our UOT-Pooling\nlayers.",

    "abstract": "The learning process of deep learning methods usually updates the model's\nparameters in multiple iterations. Each iteration can be viewed as the\nfirst-order approximation of Taylor's series expansion. The remainder, which\nconsists of higher-order terms, is usually ignored in the learning process for\nsimplicity. This learning scheme empowers various multimedia based\napplications, such as image retrieval, recommendation system, and video search.\nGenerally, multimedia data (e.g., images) are semantics-rich and\nhigh-dimensional, hence the remainders of approximations are possibly non-zero.\nIn this work, we consider the remainder to be informative and study how it\naffects the learning process. To this end, we propose a new learning approach,\nnamely gradient adjustment learning (GAL), to leverage the knowledge learned\nfrom the past training iterations to adjust vanilla gradients, such that the\nremainders are minimized and the approximations are improved. The proposed GAL\nis model- and optimizer-agnostic, and is easy to adapt to the standard learning\nframework. It is evaluated on three tasks, i.e., image classification, object\ndetection, and regression, with state-of-the-art models and optimizers.

    "abstract": "A key challenge for machine intelligence is to learn new visual concepts\nwithout forgetting the previously acquired knowledge. Continual learning is\naimed towards addressing this challenge. However, there is a gap between\nexisting supervised continual learning and human-like intelligence, where human\nis able to learn from both labeled and unlabeled data. How unlabeled data\naffects learning and catastrophic forgetting in the continual learning process\nremains unknown. To explore these issues, we formulate a new semi-supervised\ncontinual learning method, which can be generically applied to existing\ncontinual learning models. Specifically, a novel gradient learner learns from\nlabeled data to predict gradients on unlabeled data. Hence, the unlabeled data\ncould fit into the supervised continual learning method. Different from\nconventional semi-supervised settings, we do not hypothesize that the\nunderlying classes, which are associated to the unlabeled data, are known to\nthe learning process. In other words, the unlabeled data could be very distinct\nfrom the labeled data. We evaluate the proposed method on mainstream continual\nlearning, adversarial continual learning, and semi-supervised learning tasks.\nThe proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification\naccuracy and backward transfer in the continual learning setting while\nachieving desired performance on classification accuracy in the semi-supervised\nlearning setting.

The aim of this paper is\nto investigate the problem of locating the UAV itself through a purely visual\napproach. This task mainly refers to: matching the corresponding geo-tagged\nsatellite images through the images acquired by the camera when the UAV does\nnot acquire GNSS signals, where the satellite images are the bridge between the\nUAV images and the location information. However, the sampling points of\nprevious cross-view datasets based on UAVs are discrete in spatial distribution\nand the inter-class relationships are not established. In the actual process of\nUAV-localization, the inter-class feature similarity of the proximity position\ndistribution should be small due to the continuity of UAV movement in space. In\nview of this, this paper has reformulated an intensive dataset for UAV\npositioning tasks, which is named DenseUAV, aiming to solve the problems caused\nby spatial distance and scale transformation in practical application\nscenarios, so as to achieve high-precision UAV-localization in GNSS denial\nenvironment. In addition, a new continuum-type evaluation metric named SDM is\ndesigned to evaluate the accuracy of model matching by exploiting the continuum\nof UAVs in space. Specifically, with the ideas of siamese networks and metric\nlearning, a transformer-based baseline was constructed to enhance the capture\nof spatially subtle features.

    "abstract": "Cross-view geo-localization is a task of matching the same geographic image\nfrom different views, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite. The\nmost difficult challenges are the position shift and the uncertainty of\ndistance and scale. Existing methods are mainly aimed at digging for more\ncomprehensive fine-grained information. However, it underestimates the\nimportance of extracting robust feature representation and the impact of\nfeature alignment. The CNN-based methods have achieved great success in\ncross-view geo-localization. However it still has some limitations, e.g., it\ncan only extract part of the information in the neighborhood and some scale\nreduction operations will make some fine-grained information lost. In\nparticular, we introduce a simple and efficient transformer-based structure\ncalled Feature Segmentation and Region Alignment (FSRA) to enhance the model's\nability to understand contextual information as well as to understand the\ndistribution of instances. Without using additional supervisory information,\nFSRA divides regions based on the heat distribution of the transformer's\nfeature map, and then aligns multiple specific regions in different views one\non one. Finally, FSRA integrates each region into a set of feature\nrepresentations. The difference is that FSRA does not divide regions manually,\nbut automatically based on the heat distribution of the feature map. So that\nspecific instances can still be divided and aligned when there are significant\nshifts and scale changes in the image. In addition, a multiple sampling\nstrategy is proposed to overcome the disparity in the number of satellite\nimages and that of images from other sources. Experiments show that the\nproposed method has superior performance and achieves the state-of-the-art in\nboth tasks of drone view target localization and drone navigation.

    "title": "A Large and Diverse Arabic Corpus for Language Modeling",
    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) have introduced a major paradigm shift in Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) modeling where large pre-trained LMs became integral\nto most of the NLP tasks. The LMs are intelligent enough to find useful and\nrelevant representations of the language without any supervision. Perhaps,\nthese models are used to fine-tune typical NLP tasks with significantly high\naccuracy as compared to the traditional approaches. Conversely, the training of\nthese models requires a massively large corpus that is a good representation of\nthe language. English LMs generally perform better than their other language\ncounterparts, due to the availability of massive English corpora.\nThis work elaborates on the design and development of a large Arabic corpus.\nIt consists of over 500 GB of Arabic cleaned text targeted at improving\ncross-domain knowledge and downstream generalization capability of large-scale\nlanguage models. Moreover, the corpus is utilized in the training of a large\nArabic LM. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the LM, a number of\ntypical NLP tasks are fine-tuned. The tasks demonstrate a significant boost\nfrom 4.5 to 8.5% when compared to tasks fine-tuned on multi-lingual BERT\n(mBERT). To the best of my knowledge, this is currently the largest clean and\ndiverse Arabic corpus ever collected.",

    "abstract": "In recent years with the advent of high bandwidth internet access\navailability, the cloud computing applications have boomed. With more and more\napplications being run over the cloud and an increase in the overall user base\nof the different cloud platforms, the need for highly efficient job scheduling\ntechniques has also increased. The task of a conventional job scheduling\nalgorithm is to determine a sequence of execution for the jobs, which uses the\nleast resources like time, processing, memory, etc. Generally, the user\nrequires more services and very high efficiency. An efficient scheduling\ntechnique helps in proper utilization of the resources. In this research realm,\nthe hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms have proven to be very effective in\noptimizing the task scheduling by providing better cost efficiency than when\nsingly employed. This study presents a systematic and extensive analysis of\ntask scheduling techniques in cloud computing using the various hybrid variants\nof meta-heuristic methods, like Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Search, Harmony Search,\nArtificial Bee Colony, Particle Swarm Optimization, etc. In this research\nreview, a separate section discusses the use of various performance evaluation\nmetrics throughout the literature.",

    "abstract": "In model extraction attacks, adversaries can steal a machine learning model\nexposed via a public API by repeatedly querying it and adjusting their own\nmodel based on obtained predictions. To prevent model stealing, existing\ndefenses focus on detecting malicious queries, truncating, or distorting\noutputs, thus necessarily introducing a tradeoff between robustness and model\nutility for legitimate users. Instead, we propose to impede model extraction by\nrequiring users to complete a proof-of-work before they can read the model's\npredictions. This deters attackers by greatly increasing (even up to 100x) the\ncomputational effort needed to leverage query access for model extraction.\nSince we calibrate the effort required to complete the proof-of-work to each\nquery, this only introduces a slight overhead for regular users (up to 2x). To\nachieve this, our calibration applies tools from differential privacy to\nmeasure the information revealed by a query. Our method requires no\nmodification of the victim model and can be applied by machine learning\npractitioners to guard their publicly exposed models against being easily\nstolen.",

The wide\ndeployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) promotes the development of\ndata-driven approaches for transient stability assessment.

In this paper, we investigate Discrete\nWavelet Transform (DWT) in the frequency domain and design a new\nWavelet-Attention (WA) block to only implement attention in the high-frequency\ndomain.

    "abstract": "A major open problem in the area of infinite-duration games is to\ncharacterize winning conditions that are determined in finite-memory\nstrategies. Infinite-duration games are usually studied over edge-colored\ngraphs, with winning conditions that are defined in terms of sequences of\ncolors. In this paper, we investigate a restricted class of finite-memory\nstrategies called chromatic finite-memory strategies. While general\nfinite-memory strategies operate with sequences of edges of a game graph,\nchromatic finite-memory strategies observe only colors of these edges.\nRecent results in this area show that studying finite-memory determinacy is\nmore tractable when we restrict ourselves to chromatic strategies. On the other\nhand, as was shown by Le Roux (CiE 2020), determinacy in general finite-memory\nstrategies implies determinacy in chromatic finite-memory strategies.\nUnfortunately, this result is quite inefficient in terms of the state\ncomplexity: to replace a winning strategy with few states of general memory, we\nmight need much more states of chromatic memory. The goal of the present paper\nis to find out the exact state complexity of this transformation.\nFor every winning condition and for every game graph with $n$ nodes we show\nthe following: if this game graph has a winning strategy with $q$ states of\ngeneral memory, then it also has a winning strategy with $(q + 1)^n$ states of\nchromatic memory. We also show that this bound is almost tight. For every $q$\nand $n$, we construct a winning condition and a game graph with $n + O(1)$\nnodes, where one can win with $q$ states of general memory, but not with $q^n -\n1$ states of chromatic memory.",

However, these methods\nhighly relied on clean datasets with global labels, which limits their usage in\nmany real-world applications. An important reason is that merging and\norganizing datasets from various temporal and spatial scenarios is usually not\nrealistic, as noisy labels can be introduced and exponential-increasing\nresources are required. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nmining-during-training strategy called Basket-based Softmax (BBS) as well as\nits parallel version to effectively train models on multiple datasets in an\nend-to-end fashion. Specifically, for each training sample, we simultaneously\nadopt similarity scores as the clue to mining negative classes from other\ndatasets, and dynamically add them to assist the learning of discriminative\nfeatures. Experimentally, we demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the\nBBS on the tasks of face recognition and re-identification, with both simulated\nand real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "Anatomical movements of the human body can change the channel state\ninformation (CSI) of wireless signals in an indoor environment. These changes\nin the CSI signals can be used for human activity recognition (HAR), which is a\npredominant and unique approach due to preserving privacy and flexibility of\ncapturing motions in non-line-of-sight environments. Existing models for HAR\ngenerally have a high computational complexity, contain very large number of\ntrainable parameters, and require extensive computational resources. This issue\nis particularly important for implementation of these solutions on devices with\nlimited resources, such as edge devices. In this paper, we propose a\nlightweight human activity recognition (LiteHAR) approach which, unlike the\nstate-of-the-art deep learning models, does not require extensive training of\nlarge number of parameters. This approach uses randomly initialized convolution\nkernels for feature extraction from CSI signals without training the kernels.\nThe extracted features are then classified using Ridge regression classifier,\nwhich has a linear computational complexity and is very fast. LiteHAR is\nevaluated on a public benchmark dataset and the results show its high\nclassification performance in comparison with the complex deep learning models\nwith a much lower computational complexity.",

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of CT images from a limited set of projections through an\nobject is important in several applications ranging from medical imaging to\nindustrial settings. As the number of available projections decreases,\ntraditional reconstruction techniques such as the FDK algorithm and model-based\niterative reconstruction methods perform poorly. Recently, data-driven methods\nsuch as deep learning-based reconstruction have garnered a lot of attention in\napplications because they yield better performance when enough training data is\navailable. However, even these methods have their limitations when there is a\nscarcity of available training data. This work focuses on image reconstruction\nin such settings, i.e., when both the number of available CT projections and\nthe training data is extremely limited. We adopt a sequential reconstruction\napproach over several stages using an adversarially trained shallow network for\n'destreaking' followed by a data-consistency update in each stage. To deal with\nthe challenge of limited data, we use image subvolumes to train our method, and\npatch aggregation during testing. To deal with the computational challenge of\nlearning on 3D datasets for 3D reconstruction, we use a hybrid 3D-to-2D mapping\nnetwork for the 'destreaking' part. Comparisons to other methods over several\ntest examples indicate that the proposed method has much potential, when both\nthe number of projections and available training data are highly limited.",

    "abstract": "The recently developed technique of DOC kernels has been a great success in\nthe stability and convergence analysis for BDF2 scheme with variable time\nsteps. However, such an analysis technique seems not directly applicable to\nproblems with initial singularity. In the numerical simulations of solutions\nwith initial singularity, variable time-steps schemes like the graded mesh are\nalways adopted to achieve the optimal convergence, whose first adjacent\ntime-step ratio may become pretty large so that the acquired restriction is not\nsatisfied. In this paper, we revisit the variable time-step implicit-explicit\ntwo-step backward differentiation formula (IMEX BDF2) scheme presented in [W.\nWang, Y. Chen and H. Fang, \\emph{SIAM J. Numer. Anal.}, 57 (2019), pp.\n1289-1317] to compute the partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs) with\ninitial singularity. We obtain the sharp error estimate under a mild\nrestriction condition of adjacent time-step ratios $r_{k}: =\\tau_{k}/\\tau_{k-1}\n\\; (k\\geq 3) < r_{\\max} = 4.8645 $ and a much mild requirement on the first\nratio, i.e., $r_2>0$. This leads to the validation of our analysis of the\nvariable time-step IMEX BDF2 scheme when the initial singularity is dealt by a\nsimple strategy, i.e., the graded mesh $t_k=T(k/N)^{\\gamma}$. In this\nsituation, the convergence of order $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-\\min\\{2,\\gamma \\alpha\\}})$\nis achieved with $N$ and $\\alpha$ respectively representing the total mesh\npoints and indicating the regularity of the exact solution. This is, the\noptical convergence will be achieved by taking $\\gamma_{\\text{opt}}=2/\\alpha$.\nNumerical examples are provided to demonstrate our theoretical analysis.",

To understand this inadequacy, there is need to investigate if\nspectral analysis of transformer will reveal insights on its expressive power.\nSimilar studies already established that spectral analysis of Graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) provides extra perspectives on their expressiveness. In this\nwork, we systematically study and prove the link between the spatial and\nspectral domain in the realm of the transformer. We further provide a\ntheoretical analysis that the spatial attention mechanism in the transformer\ncannot effectively capture the desired frequency response, thus, inherently\nlimiting its expressiveness in spectral space. Therefore, we propose FeTA, a\nframework that aims to perform attention over the entire graph spectrum\nanalogous to the attention in spatial space. Empirical results suggest that\nFeTA provides homogeneous performance gain against vanilla transformer across\nall tasks on standard benchmarks and can easily be extended to GNN based models\nwith low-pass characteristics (e.g., GAT).

    "abstract": "A robotic swarm may encounter traffic congestion when many robots\nsimultaneously attempt to reach the same area. For solving that efficiently,\nrobots must execute decentralised traffic control algorithms. In this work, we\npropose a measure for evaluating the access efficiency of a common target area\nas the number of robots in the swarm rises: the common target area throughput.\nWe demonstrate that the throughput of a target region with a limited area as\nthe time tends to infinity -- the asymptotic throughput -- is finite, opposed\nto the relation arrival time at target per number of robots that tends to\ninfinity. Using this measure, we can analytically compare the effectiveness of\ndifferent algorithms. In particular, we propose and formally evaluate three\ndifferent theoretical strategies for getting to a circular target area: (i)\nforming parallel queues towards the target area, (ii) forming a hexagonal\npacking through a corridor going to the target, and (iii) making multiple\ncurved trajectories towards the boundary of the target area. We calculate the\nthroughput for a fixed time and the asymptotic throughput for these strategies.\nAdditionally, we corroborate these results by simulations, showing that when an\nalgorithm has higher throughput, its arrival time per number of robots is\nlower. Thus, we conclude that using throughput is well suited for comparing\ncongestion algorithms for a common target area in robotic swarms even if we do\nnot have their closed asymptotic equation.",

Specifically, we\nfirst develop a novel user pairing scheme for the THz-NOMA network which\nensures the performance gains of NOMA over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) for\neach individual user in the NOMA pair and adapts according to the molecular\nabsorption. Then, we characterize novel outage probability expressions\nconsidering a single-carrier and multi-carrier THz-NOMA network in the presence\nof various user pairing schemes, Nakagami-m channel fading, and molecular\nabsorption noise. We propose a moment-generating-function (MGF) based approach\nto analyze the outage probability of users in a multi-carrier THz network.\nFurthermore, for negligible thermal noise, we provide simplified\nsingle-integral expressions to compute the outage probability in a\nmulti-carrier network. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of the\nproposed user-pairing scheme and validate the accuracy of the derived\nexpressions.",

    "abstract": "Approaches based on Functional Causal Models (FCMs) have been proposed to\ndetermine causal direction between two variables, by properly restricting model\nclasses; however, their performance is sensitive to the model assumptions,\nwhich makes it difficult for practitioners to use. In this paper, we provide a\nnovel dynamical-system view of FCMs and propose a new framework for identifying\ncausal direction in the bivariate case. We first show the connection between\nFCMs and optimal transport, and then study optimal transport under the\nconstraints of FCMs. Furthermore, by exploiting the dynamical interpretation of\noptimal transport under the FCM constraints, we determine the corresponding\nunderlying dynamical process of the static cause-effect pair data under the\nleast action principle. It provides a new dimension for describing static\ncausal discovery tasks, while enjoying more freedom for modeling the\nquantitative causal influences. In particular, we show that Additive Noise\nModels (ANMs) correspond to volume-preserving pressureless flows. Consequently,\nbased on their velocity field divergence, we introduce a criterion to determine\ncausal direction. With this criterion, we propose a novel optimal\ntransport-based algorithm for ANMs which is robust to the choice of models and\nextend it to post-noninear models.

The digital model needs to incorporate\ngeometric requirements for its components, such as planarity of panels due to\nconsideration of construction costs, which can make the modeling process more\nchallenging. In this work, we present a novel sketch-based system to bridge the\nconcept design and digital modeling of freeform roof-like shapes represented as\nplanar quadrilateral (PQ) meshes. Our system allows the user to sketch the\nsurface boundary and contour lines under axonometric projection and supports\nthe sketching of occluded regions.

    "abstract": "Lead pipe remediation budgets are limited and ought to maximize public health\nimpact. This goal implies a non-trivial optimization problem; lead service\nlines connect water mains to individual houses, but any realistic replacement\nstrategy must batch replacements at a larger scale. Additionally, planners\ntypically lack a principled method for comparing the relative public health\nvalue of potential interventions and often plan projects based on non-health\nfactors. This paper describes a simple process for estimating child health\nimpact at a parcel level by cleaning and synthesizing municipal datasets that\nare commonly available but seldom joined due to data quality issues. Using\ngeocoding as the core record linkage mechanism, parcel-level toxicity data can\nbe combined with school enrollment records to indicate where young children and\nlead lines coexist. A practical heuristic of estimated exposure-years is\ndescribed at the parcel level, which can then be aggregated to the project\nlevel and minimized globally by selecting projects using a knapsack\noptimization. The optimization setup can then be relaxed to produce a priority\nqueue which planners can consider alongside numerous harder to quantify\nfactors. A case study demonstrates the successful application of this framework\nto a small U.S.~city's existing data in order to prioritize federal\ninfrastructure funding. While this paper focuses on lead in drinking water, the\napproach readily generalizes to other sources of residential toxicity with\ndisproportionate impact on children.",

    "abstract": "Label assignment plays a significant role in modern object detection models.\nDetection models may yield totally different performances with different label\nassignment strategies. For anchor-based detection models, the IoU threshold\nbetween the anchors and their corresponding ground truth bounding boxes is the\nkey element since the positive samples and negative samples are divided by the\nIoU threshold. Early object detectors simply utilize a fixed threshold for all\ntraining samples, while recent detection algorithms focus on adaptive\nthresholds based on the distribution of the IoUs to the ground truth boxes. In\nthis paper, we introduce a simple and effective approach to perform label\nassignment dynamically based on the training status with predictions. By\nintroducing the predictions in label assignment, more high-quality samples with\nhigher IoUs to the ground truth objects are selected as the positive samples,\nwhich could reduce the discrepancy between the classification scores and the\nIoU scores, and generate more high-quality boundary boxes. Our approach shows\nimprovements in the performance of the detection models with the adaptive label\nassignment algorithm and lower bounding box losses for those positive samples,\nindicating more samples with higher quality predicted boxes are selected as\npositives.

For example, in social\nnetworks, each user maintains a local view of a social graph, such as a list of\nfriends and her profile. It is typical to collect these local views of social\ngraphs and conduct graph learning tasks. However, learning over graphs can\nraise privacy concerns as these local views often contain sensitive\ninformation.\nIn this paper, we seek to ensure private graph learning on a decentralized\nnetwork graph.

The\ncrux of {\\em Solitude} is a set of new delicate mechanisms that can calibrate\nthe introduced noise in the decentralized graph collected from the users. The\nprinciple behind the calibration is the intrinsic properties shared by many\nreal-world graphs, such as sparsity.

To improve CXR report generation, we investigate\nwarm-starting the encoder and decoder with recent open-source computer vision\nand natural language processing checkpoints, such as the Vision Transformer\n(ViT) and PubMedBERT. To this end, each checkpoint is evaluated on the\nMIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets using natural language generation and Clinical\nEfficacy (CE) metrics. Our experimental investigation demonstrates that the\nConvolutional vision Transformer (CvT) ImageNet-21K and the Distilled\nGenerative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (DistilGPT2) checkpoints are best for\nwarm-starting the encoder and decoder, respectively.

However, the synthetic training data has different styles\nand erratic quality. Besides, there is a large gap between the source data and\nthe target data.

Our\nframework is composed of three components, Document Layout Generator (GLD),\nDocument Elements Decorator(GED), and Document Style Discriminator(DSD). The\nGLD is used to document layout generates, the GED is used to document layout\nelements fill, and the DSD is used to document quality assessment and\ncross-domain guidance. First, we apply GLD to predict the positions of the\ngenerated document. Then, we design a novel algorithm based on aesthetic\nguidance to fill the document positions. Finally, we use contrastive learning\nto evaluate the quality assessment of the document.

GSC-PCCs can be seen as a generalization of the original\nspatially-coupled parallel concatenated codes proposed by Moloudi et al.

However, the trained model may memorize certain information\nabout the training data. With the recent legislation on right to be forgotten,\nit is crucially essential for the FL model to possess the ability to forget\nwhat it has learned from each client. We propose a novel federated unlearning\nmethod to eliminate a client's contribution by subtracting the accumulated\nhistorical updates from the model and leveraging the knowledge distillation\nmethod to restore the model's performance without using any data from the\nclients. This method does not have any restrictions on the type of neural\nnetworks and does not rely on clients' participation, so it is practical and\nefficient in the FL system. We further introduce backdoor attacks in the\ntraining process to help evaluate the unlearning effect. Experiments on three\ncanonical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.",

    "abstract": "Safety in dynamical systems is commonly pursued using control barrier\nfunctions (CBFs) which enforce safety-constraints over the entire duration of a\nsystem's evolution. We propose a prescribed-time safety (PTSf) design which\nenforces safety only for a finite time of interest to the user. While\ntraditional CBF designs would keep the system farther from the barrier than\nnecessary, and longer than necessary, our PTSf design lets the system reach the\nbarrier by the prescribed time and obey the operator's intent thereafter. To\nemphasize the capability of our design for safety constraints with high\nrelative degrees, we focus our exposition on a chain of integrators where the\nsafety condition is defined for the state furthest from the control input. In\ncontrast to existing CBF-based methods for high-relative degree constraints,\nour approach involves choosing explicitly specified gains (instead of class\n$\\mathcal{K}$ functions), and, with the aid of backstepping, operates in the\nentirety of the original safe set with no additional restriction on the initial\nconditions. With QP being employed in the design, in addition to backstepping\nand CBFs with a PTSf property, we refer to our design as a QP-backstepping\nPT-CBF design.

    "abstract": "It is a challenging task to learn discriminative representation from images\nand videos, due to large local redundancy and complex global dependency in\nthese visual data. Convolution neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers\n(ViTs) have been two dominant frameworks in the past few years. Though CNNs can\nefficiently decrease local redundancy by convolution within a small\nneighborhood, the limited receptive field makes it hard to capture global\ndependency. Alternatively, ViTs can effectively capture long-range dependency\nvia self-attention, while blind similarity comparisons among all the tokens\nlead to high redundancy. To resolve these problems, we propose a novel Unified\ntransFormer (UniFormer), which can seamlessly integrate the merits of\nconvolution and self-attention in a concise transformer format. Different from\nthe typical transformer blocks, the relation aggregators in our UniFormer block\nare equipped with local and global token affinity respectively in shallow and\ndeep layers, allowing to tackle both redundancy and dependency for efficient\nand effective representation learning. Finally, we flexibly stack our UniFormer\nblocks into a new powerful backbone, and adopt it for various vision tasks from\nimage to video domain, from classification to dense prediction. Without any\nextra training data, our UniFormer achieves 86.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K\nclassification. With only ImageNet-1K pre-training, it can simply achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance in a broad range of downstream tasks, e.g., it\nobtains 82.9/84.8 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400/600, 60.9/71.2 top-1 accuracy\non Something-Something V1/V2 video classification tasks, 53.8 box AP and 46.4\nmask AP on COCO object detection task, 50.8 mIoU on ADE20K semantic\nsegmentation task, and 77.4 AP on COCO pose estimation task.

    "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in four people will be\naffected by mental disorders at some point in their lives. However, in many\nparts of the world, patients do not actively seek professional diagnosis\nbecause of stigma attached to mental illness, ignorance of mental health and\nits associated symptoms. In this paper, we propose a model for passively\ndetecting mental disorders using conversations on Reddit. Specifically, we\nfocus on a subset of mental disorders that are characterized by distinct\nemotional patterns (henceforth called emotional disorders): major depressive,\nanxiety, and bipolar disorders. Through passive (i.e., unprompted) detection,\nwe can encourage patients to seek diagnosis and treatment for mental disorders.\nOur proposed model is different from other work in this area in that our model\nis based entirely on the emotional states, and the transition between these\nstates of users on Reddit, whereas prior work is typically based on\ncontent-based representations (e.g., n-grams, language model embeddings, etc).\nWe show that content-based representation is affected by domain and topic bias\nand thus does not generalize, while our model, on the other hand, suppresses\ntopic-specific information and thus generalizes well across different topics\nand times. We conduct experiments on our model's ability to detect different\nemotional disorders and on the generalizability of our model. Our experiments\nshow that while our model performs comparably to content-based models, such as\nBERT, it generalizes much better across time and topic.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of wireless devices and their ever increasing influence on\nour day-to-day life is very evident and seems irreplaceable. This exponential\ngrowth in demand, both in terms of the number of devices and Quality of Service\n(QoS) had spawned the concept of cross-layer optimization several years ago.\nThe primary goal of the cross-layer approach was to liberate the strict\nboundary between the layers of the traditional Open Systems Interconnection\n(OSI) protocol stack. The initial decade focused on establishing the\ntheoretical feasibility of this revolutionary concept and gauging the\neffectiveness and limits of this idea. During the next phase, the advent of\nsoftware defined radios (SDR) accelerated the growth of this domain due to its\nadded flexibility. Yet, there has been a gaping abyss between solutions\ndesigned in theory and ones deployed in practice. To establish this, we first\npresent an elaborate survey of the cross-layer protocol stack literature. Next,\nwe briefly discuss how a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), low SWaP (Size,\nWeight, and Power) embedded SDR (e-SDR) was transformed into a standalone,\nfieldable transceiver. Thereafter, we provide the software design ethos that\nfocuses on efficiency and flexibility such that the optimization objectives and\ncross-layer interactions can be reconfigured rapidly. To demonstrate our\nclaims, we provide results from extensive outdoor over-the-air experiments in\nvarious settings with up to 10-node network topologies. The results from the\nfield trials demonstrate high reliability, throughput, and dynamic routing\ncapability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in literature,\na COTS e-SDR has been leveraged to successfully design a cross-layer optimized\ntransceiver that is capable of forming an ad hoc network that provides high\nthroughput and high reliability in a ruggedized, weatherized, and fieldable\nform factor.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a sequential convex programming approach for Mars entry\ntrajectory planning by range discretization. To improve the accuracy of\nnumerical integration, the range of entry trajectory is selected as the\nindependent variable rather than time or energy. A dilation factor is employed\nto normalize the entry dynamics and integration interval of the performance\nindex so that the difficult free-final-time programming problem can be\nconverted to a fixed-final-range optimization problem. The bank angle rate with\nrespect to the range is introduced as the new control input in order to\ndecouple the control from the state and facilitate convexification of\nconstraints on the bank angle and its rate. The nonlinear bank angle rate\nconstraint is further relaxed into a linear one via inequality relaxation.\nMoreover, the nonconvex minimum-time performance index is convexified by\nregarding flight time as a state variable. Then, the Mars entry trajectory\nplanning problem can be formulated into the framework of convex programming\nafter linearization. By range discretization and successive convexification,\nthe reformulated Mars entry trajectory planning problem is transcribed into a\nseries of convex optimization sub-problems that can be sequentially solved\nusing the convex programming algorithm. The virtual control and adaptive\ntrust-region techniques are employed to improve the accuracy, robustness, and\ncomputation efficiency of the algorithm. Numerical simulations with comparative\nstudies are presented to demonstrate the convergence performance and efficiency\nof the proposed algorithm.",

Nevertheless, CAVs need high-fidelity perception information\non their surroundings, which is available but costly to collect from various\non-board sensors, such as radar, camera, and LiDAR, as well as\nvehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. Therefore, precisely simulating the\nsensing process with high-fidelity sensor inputs and timely retrieving the\nperception information via a cost-effective platform are of increasing\nsignificance for enabling CDA-related research, e.g., development of\ndecision-making or control module.

One promising approach is to\nfirst construct graphs approximating the spaces, called roadmaps, and then\napply multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) algorithms to derive a set of\nconflict-free paths. While conventional studies have utilized roadmap\nconstruction methods developed for single-agent planning, it remains largely\nunexplored how we can construct roadmaps that work effectively for multiple\nagents. To this end, we propose a novel concept of roadmaps called cooperative\ntimed roadmaps (CTRMs). CTRMs enable each agent to focus on its important\nlocations around potential solution paths in a way that considers the behavior\nof other agents to avoid inter-agent collisions (i.e., \"cooperative\"), while\nbeing augmented in the time direction to make it easy to derive a \"timed\"\nsolution path. To construct CTRMs, we developed a machine-learning approach\nthat learns a generative model from a collection of relevant problem instances\nand plausible solutions and then uses the learned model to sample the vertices\nof CTRMs for new, previously unseen problem instances. Our empirical evaluation\nrevealed that the use of CTRMs significantly reduced the planning effort with\nacceptable overheads while maintaining a success rate and solution quality\ncomparable to conventional roadmap construction approaches.",

However, the improvement is still limited by the available training\ndata in both target styles and speakers. Additionally, degenerated performance\nis observed when the trained TTS tries to transfer the speech to a target style\nfrom a new speaker with an unknown, arbitrary style.

An inverse\nautoregressive flow (IAF) technique is first introduced to improve the\nvariational inference for learning an expressive style representation.

Today, automated speaker recognition technologies are deployed on\nbillions of smart devices and in services such as call centres. Despite their\nwide-scale deployment and known sources of bias in face recognition and natural\nlanguage processing, bias in automated speaker recognition has not been studied\nsystematically. We present an in-depth empirical and analytical study of bias\nin the machine learning development workflow of speaker verification, a voice\nbiometric and core task in automated speaker recognition.

    "abstract": "The cybersecurity breaches expose surveillance video streams to forgery\nattacks, under which authentic streams are falsified to hide unauthorized\nactivities. Traditional video forensics approaches can localize forgery traces\nusing spatial-temporal analysis on relatively long video clips, while falling\nshort in real-time forgery detection. The recent work correlates time-series\ncamera and wireless signals to detect looped videos but cannot realize\nfine-grained forgery localization. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nSecure-Pose, which exploits the pervasive coexistence of surveillance and Wi-Fi\ninfrastructures to defend against video forgery attacks in a real-time and\nfine-grained manner. We observe that coexisting camera and Wi-Fi signals convey\ncommon human semantic information and forgery attacks on video streams will\ndecouple such information correspondence. Particularly, retrievable human pose\nfeatures are first extracted from concurrent video and Wi-Fi channel state\ninformation (CSI) streams. Then, a lightweight detection network is developed\nto accurately discover forgery attacks and an efficient localization algorithm\nis devised to seamlessly track forgery traces in video streams. We implement\nSecure-Pose using one Logitech camera and two Intel 5300 NICs and evaluate it\nin different environments. Secure-Pose achieves a high detection accuracy of\n98.7% and localizes abnormal objects under playback and tampering attacks.",

    "title": "Dual Preference Distribution Learning for Item Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recommender systems can automatically recommend users items that they\nprobably like, for which the goal is to represent the user and item as well as\nmodel their interaction. Existing methods have primarily learned the user's\npreferences and item's features with vectorized representations, and modeled\nthe user-item interaction by the similarity of their representations. In fact,\nthe user's different preferences are related and capturing such relations could\nbetter understand the user's preferences for a better recommendation. Toward\nthis end, we propose to represent the user's preference with multi-variant\nGaussian distribution, and model the user-item interaction by calculating the\nprobability density at the item in the user's preference distribution. In this\nmanner, the mean vector of the Gaussian distribution is able to capture the\ncenter of the user's preferences, while its covariance matrix captures the\nrelations of these preferences. In particular, in this work, we propose a dual\npreference distribution learning framework (DUPLE), which captures the user's\npreferences to both the items and attributes by a Gaussian distribution,\nrespectively. As a byproduct, identifying the user's preference to specific\nattributes enables us to provide the explanation of recommending an item to the\nuser. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on six public datasets\nshow that DUPLE achieves the best performance over all state-of-the-art\nrecommendation methods.",

To address this issue, this paper studies the beamforming\noptimization towards seamless sensing coverage for a basic bi-static ISAC\nsystem, while ensuring that the communication requirements of multiple users\nequipment (UEs) are satisfied. Towards this end, an optimization problem is\nformulated to maximize the worst-case sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a\nprescribed coverage region, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise\nratio (SINR) requirement for each UE. To gain some insights, we first\ninvestigate the special case with one single UE and one single sensing point,\nfor which a closed-from expression of the optimal beamforming is obtained. For\nthe general case with multiple communication UEs and contiguous regional\nsensing coverage, an efficient algorithm based on successive convex\napproximation (SCA) is proposed to solve the non-convex beamforming\noptimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design is\nable to achieve seamless sensing coverage in the prescribed region, while\nguaranteeing the communication requirements of the UEs.",

    "title": "PaRT: Parallel Learning Towards Robust and Transparent AI",
    "abstract": "This paper takes a parallel learning approach for robust and transparent AI.\nA deep neural network is trained in parallel on multiple tasks, where each task\nis trained only on a subset of the network resources. Each subset consists of\nnetwork segments, that can be combined and shared across specific tasks. Tasks\ncan share resources with other tasks, while having independent task-related\nnetwork resources. Therefore, the trained network can share similar\nrepresentations across various tasks, while also enabling independent\ntask-related representations. The above allows for some crucial outcomes. (1)\nThe parallel nature of our approach negates the issue of catastrophic\nforgetting. (2) The sharing of segments uses network resources more\nefficiently. (3) We show that the network does indeed use learned knowledge\nfrom some tasks in other tasks, through shared representations. (4) Through\nexamination of individual task-related and shared representations, the model\noffers transparency in the network and in the relationships across tasks in a\nmulti-task setting. Evaluation of the proposed approach against complex\ncompeting approaches such as Continual Learning, Neural Architecture Search,\nand Multi-task learning shows that it is capable of learning robust\nrepresentations. This is the first effort to train a DL model on multiple tasks\nin parallel. Our code is available at https://github.com/MahsaPaknezhad/PaRT",

    "abstract": "Detecting communities in complex networks can shed light on the essential\ncharacteristics and functions of the modeled phenomena. This topic has\nattracted researchers of various fields from both academia and industry. Among\nthe different methods implemented for community detection, Genetic Algorithms\n(GA) have become popular recently. Considering the drawbacks of the currently\nused locus-based and solution-vector-based encodings to represent the\nindividuals, in this paper, we propose (1) a new node similarity-based encoding\nmethod to represent a network partition as an individual named MST-based. Then,\nwe propose (2) a new Adaptive Genetic Algorithm for Community Detection, along\nwith (3) a new initial population generation function, and (4) a new adaptive\nmutation function called sine-based mutation function. Using the proposed\nmethod, we combine similarity-based and modularity-optimization-based\napproaches to find the communities of complex networks in an evolutionary\nframework. Besides the fact that the proposed representation scheme can avoid\nmeaningless mutations or disconnected communities, we show that the new initial\npopulation generation function, and the new adaptive mutation function, can\nimprove the convergence time of the algorithm. Experiments and statistical\ntests verify the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with several\nclassic and state-of-the-art algorithms.",

In this paper, we exploit the\nflexible multibeam satellite capabilities and the geographical distribution of\nusers to improve the performance of satellite-assisted edge caching systems.\nOur aim is to jointly optimize the bandwidth allocation in multibeam and\ncaching decisions at the edge nodes to address two important problems: i) cache\nfeeding time minimization and ii) cache hits maximization.

Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed design\nis evaluated under the realistic beams coverage of the satellite SES-14 and\nMovielens data set. Numerical results show that our proposed joint design can\nreduce the caching feeding time by 50\\% and increase the cache hit ratio (CHR)\nby 10\\% to 20\\% compared to existing solutions.

    "abstract": "Backdoor injection attack is an emerging threat to the security of neural\nnetworks, however, there still exist limited effective defense methods against\nthe attack. In this paper, we propose BAERASE, a novel method that can erase\nthe backdoor injected into the victim model through machine unlearning.\nSpecifically, BAERASE mainly implements backdoor defense in two key steps.\nFirst, trigger pattern recovery is conducted to extract the trigger patterns\ninfected by the victim model. Here, the trigger pattern recovery problem is\nequivalent to the one of extracting an unknown noise distribution from the\nvictim model, which can be easily resolved by the entropy maximization based\ngenerative model. Subsequently, BAERASE leverages these recovered trigger\npatterns to reverse the backdoor injection procedure and induce the victim\nmodel to erase the polluted memories through a newly designed gradient ascent\nbased machine unlearning method. Compared with the previous machine unlearning\nsolutions, the proposed approach gets rid of the reliance on the full access to\ntraining data for retraining and shows higher effectiveness on backdoor erasing\nthan existing fine-tuning or pruning methods. Moreover, experiments show that\nBAERASE can averagely lower the attack success rates of three kinds of\nstate-of-the-art backdoor attacks by 99\\% on four benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Computational task offloading based on edge computing can deal with the\nperformance bottleneck faced by traditional cloud-based systems for industrial\nInternet of things (IIoT). To further optimize computing efficiency and\nresource allocation, collaborative offloading has been put forward to enable\nthe offloading from edge devices to IIoT terminal devices. However, there still\nlack incentive mechanisms to encourage participants to take over the tasks from\nothers. To counter this situation, this paper proposes a distributed\ncomputational resource trading strategy considering multiple preferences of\nIIoT users. Unlike most existing works, the objective of our trading strategy\ncomprehensively considers different satisfaction degrees with task delay,\nenergy consumption, price, and user reputation of both requesters and\ncollaborators. Our system uses blockchain to enhance the decentralization,\nsecurity, and automation.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and a good\nprognosis depends on early diagnosis. Unfortunately, screening programs for the\nearly diagnosis of lung cancer are uncommon. This is in-part due to the at-risk\ngroups being located in rural areas far from medical facilities. Reaching these\npopulations would require a scaled approach that combines mobility, low cost,\nspeed, accuracy, and privacy. We can resolve these issues by combining the\nchest X-ray imaging mode with a federated deep-learning approach, provided that\nthe federated model is trained on homogenous data to ensure that no single data\nsource can adversely bias the model at any point in time. In this study we show\nthat an image pre-processing pipeline that homogenizes and debiases chest X-ray\nimages can improve both internal classification and external generalization,\npaving the way for a low-cost and accessible deep learning-based clinical\nsystem for lung cancer screening. An evolutionary pruning mechanism is used to\ntrain a nodule detection deep learning model on the most informative images\nfrom a publicly available lung nodule X-ray dataset. Histogram equalization is\nused to remove systematic differences in image brightness and contrast. Model\ntraining is performed using all combinations of lung field segmentation, close\ncropping, and rib suppression operators. We show that this pre-processing\npipeline results in deep learning models that successfully generalize an\nindependent lung nodule dataset using ablation studies to assess the\ncontribution of each operator in this pipeline. In stripping chest X-ray images\nof known confounding variables by lung field segmentation, along with\nsuppression of signal noise from the bone structure we can train a highly\naccurate deep learning lung nodule detection algorithm with outstanding\ngeneralization accuracy of 89% to nodule samples in unseen data.",

There is a lack of dataset for multi-HP in the wild with such\ncharacteristics. In this article, we propose the dataset CCIHP based on the\nmulti-HP dataset CIHP, with 20 new labels covering these 3 kinds of\ncharacteristics. In addition, we propose HPTR, a new bottom-up multi-task\nmethod based on transformers as a fast and scalable baseline. It is the fastest\nmethod of multi-HP state of the art while having precision comparable to the\nmost precise bottom-up method. We hope this will encourage research for fast\nand accurate methods of precise human descriptions.",

    "abstract": "How human-like do conversational robots need to look to enable long-term\nhuman-robot conversation? One essential aspect of long-term interaction is a\nhuman's ability to adapt to the varying degrees of a conversational partner's\nengagement and emotions. Prosodically, this can be achieved through\n(dis)entrainment. While speech-synthesis has been a limiting factor for many\nyears, restrictions in this regard are increasingly mitigated. These\nadvancements now emphasise the importance of studying the effect of robot\nembodiment on human entrainment. In this study, we conducted a between-subjects\nonline human-robot interaction experiment in an educational use-case scenario\nwhere a tutor was either embodied through a human or a robot face. 43\nEnglish-speaking participants took part in the study for whom we analysed the\ndegree of acoustic-prosodic entrainment to the human or robot face,\nrespectively. We found that the degree of subjective and objective perception\nof anthropomorphism positively correlates with acoustic-prosodic entrainment.",

    "abstract": "The numerical optimization of an electrical machine entails computationally\nintensive and time-consuming magneto-static finite element (FE) simulation.\nGenerally, this FE-simulation involves varying input geometry, electrical, and\nmaterial parameters of an electrical machine. The result of the FE simulation\ncharacterizes the electromagnetic behavior of the electrical machine. It\nusually includes nonlinear iron losses and electromagnetic torque and flux at\ndifferent time-steps for an electrical cycle at each operating point (varying\nelectrical input phase current and control angle). In this paper, we present a\nnovel data-driven deep learning (DL) approach to approximate the\nelectromagnetic behavior of an electrical machine by predicting intermediate\nmeasures that include non-linear iron losses, a non-negligible fraction\n($\\frac{1}{6}$ of a whole electrical period) of the electromagnetic torque and\nflux at different time-steps for each operating point. The remaining time-steps\nof the electromagnetic flux and torque for an electrical cycle are estimated by\nexploiting the magnetic state symmetry of the electrical machine. Then these\ncalculations, along with the system parameters, are fed as input to the\nphysics-based analytical models to estimate characteristic maps and key\nperformance indicators (KPIs) such as material cost, maximum torque, power,\ntorque ripple, etc. The key idea is to train the proposed multi-branch deep\nneural network (DNN) step by step on a large volume of stored FE data in a\nsupervised manner. Preliminary results exhibit that the predictions of\nintermediate measures and the subsequent computations of KPIs are close to the\nground truth for a new machine design in the input design space. In the end,\nthe quantitative analysis validates that the hybrid approach is more accurate\nthan the existing DNN-based direct prediction of KPIs, which avoids\nelectromagnetic calculations.",

A robot manipulator can only move in a subspace of its whole\nrange that is subjected to many geometric constraints. A TAMP solver usually\ntakes many explorations before finding a feasible binding set for each task. It\nis favorable to learn those constraints once and then transfer them over\ndifferent tasks within the same workspace. We address this problem by\nrepresenting constraint knowledge with transferable primitives and using\nBayesian optimization (BO) based on these primitives to guide binding search in\nfurther tasks. Via semantic and geometric backtracking in TAMP, we construct\nconstraint primitives to encode the geometric constraints respectively in a\nreusable form. Then we devise a BO approach to efficiently utilize the\naccumulated constraints for guiding node expansion of an MCTS-based binding\nplanner. We further compose a transfer mechanism to enable free knowledge flow\nbetween TAMP tasks.

Recent\nwork has used generative models (GANs in particular) for providing\nhigh-fidelity simulation of real-world systems. However, such generative models\nare often monolithic and miss out on modeling the interaction in multi-agent\nsystems. In this work, we take a first step towards building multiple\ninteracting generative models (GANs) that reflects the interaction in real\nworld. We build and analyze a hierarchical set-up where a higher-level GAN is\nconditioned on the output of multiple lower-level GANs. We present a technique\nof using feedback from the higher-level GAN to improve performance of\nlower-level GANs. We mathematically characterize the conditions under which our\ntechnique is impactful, including understanding the transfer learning nature of\nour set-up. We present three distinct experiments on synthetic data, time\nseries data, and image domain, revealing the wide applicability of our\ntechnique.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial examples (AEs) pose severe threats to the applications of deep\nneural networks (DNNs) to safety-critical domains, e.g., autonomous driving.\nWhile there has been a vast body of AE defense solutions, to the best of our\nknowledge, they all suffer from some weaknesses, e.g., defending against only a\nsubset of AEs or causing a relatively high accuracy loss for legitimate inputs.\nMoreover, most existing solutions cannot defend against adaptive attacks,\nwherein attackers are knowledgeable about the defense mechanisms and craft AEs\naccordingly. In this paper, we propose a novel AE detection framework based on\nthe very nature of AEs, i.e., their semantic information is inconsistent with\nthe discriminative features extracted by the target DNN model. To be specific,\nthe proposed solution, namely ContraNet, models such contradiction by first\ntaking both the input and the inference result to a generator to obtain a\nsynthetic output and then comparing it against the original input. For\nlegitimate inputs that are correctly inferred, the synthetic output tries to\nreconstruct the input. On the contrary, for AEs, instead of reconstructing the\ninput, the synthetic output would be created to conform to the wrong label\nwhenever possible. Consequently, by measuring the distance between the input\nand the synthetic output with metric learning, we can differentiate AEs from\nlegitimate inputs. We perform comprehensive evaluations under various AE attack\nscenarios, and experimental results show that ContraNet outperforms existing\nsolutions by a large margin, especially under adaptive attacks. Moreover, our\nanalysis shows that successful AEs that can bypass ContraNet tend to have\nmuch-weakened adversarial semantics. We have also shown that ContraNet can be\neasily combined with adversarial training techniques to achieve further\nimproved AE defense capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Today's mainstream virtualization systems comprise of two cooperative\ncomponents: a kernel-resident driver that accesses virtualization hardware and\na user-level helper process that provides VM management and I/O virtualization.\nHowever, this virtualization architecture has intrinsic issues in both security\n(a large attack surface) and performance. While there is a long thread of work\ntrying to minimize the kernel-resident driver by offloading functions to user\nmode, they face a fundamental tradeoff between security and performance: more\noffloading may reduce the kernel attack surface, yet increase the runtime ring\ncrossings between the helper process and the driver, and thus more performance\ncost.\nThis paper explores a new design called delegated virtualization, which\ncompletely separates the control plane (the kernel driver) from the data plane\n(the helper process) and thus eliminates the kernel driver from runtime\nintervention. The resulting user-level hypervisor, called DuVisor, can handle\nall VM operations without trapping into the kernel once the kernel driver has\ndone the initialization. DuVisor retrofits existing hardware virtualization\nsupport with a new delegated virtualization extension to directly handle VM\nexits, configure virtualization registers, manage the stage-2 page table and\nvirtual devices in user mode. We have implemented the hardware extension on an\nopen-source RISC-V CPU and built a Rust-based hypervisor atop the hardware.\nEvaluation on FireSim shows that DuVisor outperforms KVM by up to 47.96\\% in a\nvariety of real-world applications and significantly reduces the attack\nsurface.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making AI agents are often faced with two important challenges: the\ndepth of the planning horizon, and the branching factor due to having many\nchoices. Hierarchical reinforcement learning methods aim to solve the first\nproblem, by providing shortcuts that skip over multiple time steps. To cope\nwith the breadth, it is desirable to restrict the agent's attention at each\nstep to a reasonable number of possible choices. The concept of affordances\n(Gibson, 1977) suggests that only certain actions are feasible in certain\nstates. In this work, we model \"affordances\" through an attention mechanism\nthat limits the available choices of temporally extended options. We present an\nonline, model-free algorithm to learn affordances that can be used to further\nlearn subgoal options. We investigate the role of hard versus soft attention in\ntraining data collection, abstract value learning in long-horizon tasks, and\nhandling a growing number of choices.

    "abstract": "Many fabless semiconductor companies outsource their designs to third-party\nfabrication houses. As trustworthiness of chain after outsourcing including\nfabrication houses is not established, any adversary in between, with malicious\nintent may tamper the design by inserting Hardware Trojans (HTs). Detection of\nsuch HTs is of utmost importance to assure the trust and integrity of the\nchips. However, the efficiency of detection techniques based on side-channel\nanalysis is largely affected by process variations. In this paper, a\nmethodology for detecting HTs by analyzing the delays of topologically\nsymmetric paths is proposed. The proposed technique, rather than depending on\ngolden ICs as a reference for HT detection, employs the concept of\nself-referencing. In this work, the fact that delays of topologically symmetric\npaths in an IC will be affected similarly by process variations is exploited. A\nprocedure to chose topologically symmetric paths that are minimally affected by\nprocess variations is presented. Further, a technique is proposed to create\ntopologically symmetric paths by inserting extra logic gates if such paths do\nnot exist in the design intrinsically. Simulations performed on ISCAS-85\nbenchmarks establish that the proposed method is able to achieve a true\npositive rate of 100% with a false positive rate less than 3%.

Though\ncomputer vision researchers have applied algorithms on large databases to\nautomatically detect wildfires, current models are computationally expensive\nand are not versatile enough for the low technology conditions of regions in\nSouth America. This comprehensive deep learning study first trains a Fully\nConvolutional Neural Network with skip connections on multispectral Landsat 8\nimages of Ecuador and the Galapagos.

Two additional Convolutional Neural Networks are\ntrained to classify the presence of a wildfire in a patch of land using these\nsegmented cirrus images. The \"experimental\" model trained on the segmented\ninputs achieves 96.5% binary accuracy and has smoother learning curves than the\n\"control model\" that is not given the segmented inputs.

    "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a promising economical\nsolution to implement cell-free networks. However, the performance gains\nachieved by IRSs critically depend on smartly tuned passive beamforming based\non the assumption that the accurate channel state information (CSI) knowledge\nis available at the central processing unit (CPU), which is practically\nimpossible. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the impact of the CSI\nuncertainty on IRS-assisted cell-free networks. We adopt a stochastic method to\ncope with the CSI uncertainty by maximizing the expectation of the sum-rate,\nwhich guarantees the robust performance over the average. Accordingly, an\naverage sum-rate maximization problem is formulated, which is non-convex and\narduous to obtain its optimal solution due to the coupled variables and the\nexpectation operation with respect to CSI uncertainties. As a compromising\napproach, we develop an efficient robust joint design algorithm with\nlow-complexity. Particularly, the original problem is equivalently transformed\ninto a tractable form by employing algebraic manipulations. Then, the locally\noptimal solution can be obtained iteratively. We further prove that the CSI\nuncertainty has no direct impact on the optimizing of the passive reflecting\nbeamforming. It is worth noting that the investigated scenario is flexible and\ngeneral in communications, thus the proposed algorithm can act as a general\nframework to solve various sum-rate maximization problems. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that IRSs can achieve considerable data rate improvement for\nconventional cell-free networks, and confirm the resilience of the proposed\nalgorithm against the CSI uncertainty.",

Fully mining the\ncorrelation and causation between the variables in a multivariate time series\nexhibits noticeable results in improving the performance of a time series\nmodel. Recently, some models have explored the dependencies between variables\nthrough end-to-end graph structure learning without the need for pre-defined\ngraphs. However, most current models do not incorporate the trade-off between\neffectiveness and flexibility and lack the guidance of domain knowledge in the\ndesign of graph learning algorithms. Besides, they have issues generating\nsparse graph structures, which pose challenges to end-to-end learning. In this\npaper, we propose Learning Sparse and Continuous Graphs for Forecasting\n(LSCGF), a novel deep learning model that joins graph learning and forecasting.\nTechnically, LSCGF leverages the spatial information into convolutional\noperation and extracts temporal dynamics using the diffusion convolution\nrecurrent network. At the same time, we propose a brand new method named Smooth\nSparse Unit (SSU) to learn sparse and continuous graph adjacency matrix.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model\nachieves state-of-the-art performances with minor trainable parameters.",

    "abstract": "The semantically disentangled latent subspace in GAN provides rich\ninterpretable controls in image generation. This paper includes two\ncontributions on semantic latent subspace analysis in the scenario of face\ngeneration using StyleGAN2. First, we propose a novel approach to disentangle\nlatent subspace semantics by exploiting existing face analysis models, e.g.,\nface parsers and face landmark detectors. These models provide the flexibility\nto construct various criterions with very concrete and interpretable semantic\nmeanings (e.g., change face shape or change skin color) to restrict latent\nsubspace disentanglement. Rich latent space controls unknown previously can be\ndiscovered using the constructed criterions. Second, we propose a new\nperspective to explain the behavior of a CNN classifier by generating\ncounterfactuals in the interpretable latent subspaces we discovered. This\nexplanation helps reveal whether the classifier learns semantics as intended.\nExperiments on various disentanglement criterions demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach. We believe this approach contributes to both areas of image\nmanipulation and counterfactual explainability of CNNs. The code is available\nat \\url{https://github.com/prclibo/ice}.",

The factored hybrid HMM provides a link to\ntransducer models in the way it models phonetic (label) context while\npreserving the strict separation of acoustic and language model of the hybrid\nHMM approach. Furthermore, we show that the factored hybrid model can be\ntrained from scratch without using phonetic state-tying in any of the training\nsteps.

Experimental results are provided for\nSwitchboard 300h and LibriSpeech. On the former task we also show that by\navoiding the phonetic state-tying step, the factored hybrid can take better\nadvantage of regularization techniques during training, compared to the\nstandard hybrid HMM with phonetic state-tying based on classification and\nregression trees (CART).",

    "abstract": "RDF knowledge graphs (KG) are powerful data structures to represent factual\nstatements created from heterogeneous data sources. KG creation is laborious,\nand demands data management techniques to be executed efficiently. This paper\ntackles the problem of the automatic generation of KG creation processes\ndeclaratively specified; it proposes techniques for planning and transforming\nheterogeneous data into RDF triples following mapping assertions specified in\nthe RDF Mapping Language (RML). Given a set of mapping assertions, the planner\nprovides an optimized execution plan by partitioning and scheduling the\nexecution of the assertions. First, the planner assesses an optimized number of\npartitions considering the number of data sources, type of mapping assertions,\nand the associations between different assertions. After providing a list of\npartitions and assertions that belong to each partition, the planner determines\ntheir execution order. A greedy algorithm is implemented to generate the\npartitions' bushy tree execution plan. Bushy tree plans are translated into\noperating system commands that guide the execution of the partitions of the\nmapping assertions in the order indicated by the bushy tree. The proposed\noptimization approach is evaluated over state-of-the-art RML-compliant engines\nand existing benchmarks of data sources and RML triples maps. Our experimental\nresults suggest that the performance of the studied engines can be considerably\nimproved, particularly in a complex setting with numerous triples maps and data\nsources. As a result, engines that usually time in complex cases out can, if\nnot entirely execute all the assertions, still produce a portion of the KG.",

Existing QG\nmethods mainly focus on building or training models for specific QG datasets.\nThese works are subject to two major limitations: (1) They are dedicated to\nspecific QG formats (e.g., answer-extraction or multi-choice QG), therefore, if\nwe want to address a new format of QG, a re-design of the QG model is required.\n(2) Optimal performance is only achieved on the dataset they were just trained\non. As a result, we have to train and keep various QG models for different QG\ndatasets, which is resource-intensive and ungeneralizable.\nTo solve the problems, we propose a model named Unified-QG based on lifelong\nlearning techniques, which can continually learn QG tasks across different\ndatasets and formats.

Its two-layer version cannot effectively propagate the\nlabel information to the whole graph structure (i.e., the under-smoothing\nproblem) while its deep version over-smoothens and is hard to train (i.e., the\nover-smoothing problem). To solve these two issues, we propose a new graph\nneural network called GND-Nets (for Graph Neural Diffusion Networks) that\nexploits the local and global neighborhood information of a vertex in a single\nlayer.

The utilization of the local and global neighborhood\ninformation of a vertex is achieved by a new graph diffusion method called\nneural diffusions, which integrate neural networks into the conventional linear\nand nonlinear graph diffusions. The adoption of neural networks makes neural\ndiffusions adaptable to different datasets.

    "abstract": "Learning-based pre-simulation (i.e., layout-to-fabrication) models have been\nproposed to predict the fabrication-induced shape deformation from an IC layout\nto its fabricated circuit. Such models are usually driven by pairwise learning,\ninvolving a training set of layout patterns and their reference shape images\nafter fabrication. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to collect the\nreference shape images of all layout clips for model training and updating. To\naddress the problem, we propose a deep learning-based layout novelty detection\nscheme to identify novel (unseen) layout patterns, which cannot be well\npredicted by a pre-trained pre-simulation model. We devise a global-local\nnovelty scoring mechanism to assess the potential novelty of a layout by\nexploiting two subnetworks: an autoencoder and a pretrained pre-simulation\nmodel. The former characterizes the global structural dissimilarity between a\ngiven layout and training samples, whereas the latter extracts a latent code\nrepresenting the fabrication-induced local deformation. By integrating the\nglobal dissimilarity with the local deformation boosted by a self-attention\nmechanism, our model can accurately detect novelties without the ground-truth\ncircuit shapes of test samples. Based on the detected novelties, we further\npropose two active-learning strategies to sample a reduced amount of\nrepresentative layouts most worthy to be fabricated for acquiring their\nground-truth circuit shapes. Experimental results demonstrate i) our method's\neffectiveness in layout novelty detection, and ii) our active-learning\nstrategies' ability in selecting representative novel layouts for keeping a\nlearning-based pre-simulation model updated.",

    "title": "Hot-Refresh Model Upgrades with Regression-Alleviating Compatible  Training in Image Retrieval",
    "abstract": "The task of hot-refresh model upgrades of image retrieval systems plays an\nessential role in the industry but has never been investigated in academia\nbefore. Conventional cold-refresh model upgrades can only deploy new models\nafter the gallery is overall backfilled, taking weeks or even months for\nmassive data. In contrast, hot-refresh model upgrades deploy the new model\nimmediately and then gradually improve the retrieval accuracy by backfilling\nthe gallery on-the-fly. Compatible training has made it possible, however, the\nproblem of model regression with negative flips poses a great challenge to the\nstable improvement of user experience. We argue that it is mainly due to the\nfact that new-to-old positive query-gallery pairs may show less similarity than\nnew-to-new negative pairs. To solve the problem, we introduce a\nRegression-Alleviating Compatible Training (RACT) method to properly constrain\nthe feature compatibility while reducing negative flips. The core is to\nencourage the new-to-old positive pairs to be more similar than both the\nnew-to-old negative pairs and the new-to-new negative pairs. An efficient\nuncertainty-based backfilling strategy is further introduced to fasten accuracy\nimprovements. Extensive experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks (e.g.,\nGoogle Landmark) demonstrate that our RACT effectively alleviates the model\nregression for one more step towards seamless model upgrades.

    "abstract": "We study signaling in Bayesian ad auctions, in which bidders' valuations\ndepend on a random, unknown state of nature. The auction mechanism has complete\nknowledge of the actual state of nature, and it can send signals to bidders so\nas to disclose information about the state and increase revenue. For instance,\na state may collectively encode some features of the user that are known to the\nmechanism only, since the latter has access to data sources unaccessible to the\nbidders. We study the problem of computing how the mechanism should send\nsignals to bidders in order to maximize revenue. While this problem has already\nbeen addressed in the easier setting of second-price auctions, to the best of\nour knowledge, our work is the first to explore ad auctions with more than one\nslot. In this paper, we focus on public signaling and VCG mechanisms, under\nwhich bidders truthfully report their valuations. We start with a negative\nresult, showing that, in general, the problem does not admit a PTAS unless P =\nNP, even when bidders' valuations are known to the mechanism. The rest of the\npaper is devoted to settings in which such negative result can be circumvented.\nFirst, we prove that, with known valuations, the problem can indeed be solved\nin polynomial time when either the number of states d or the number of slots m\nis fixed. Moreover, in the same setting, we provide an FPTAS for the case in\nwhich bidders are single minded, but d and m can be arbitrary. Then, we switch\nto the random valuations setting, in which these are randomly drawn according\nto some probability distribution. In this case, we show that the problem admits\nan FPTAS, a PTAS, and a QPTAS, when, respectively, d is fixed, m is fixed, and\nbidders' valuations are bounded away from zero.",

    "abstract": "Currently, fixed static sensing is a primary way to monitor environmental\ndata like air quality in cities. However, to obtain a dense spatial coverage, a\nlarge number of static monitors are required, thereby making it a costly\noption. Dense spatiotemporal coverage can be achieved using only a fraction of\nstatic sensors by deploying them on the moving vehicles, known as the drive by\nsensing paradigm. The redundancy present in the air quality data can be\nexploited by processing the sparsely sampled data to impute the remaining\nunobserved data points using the matrix completion techniques. However, the\naccuracy of imputation is dependent on the extent to which the moving sensors\ncapture the inherent structure of the air quality matrix. Therefore, the\nchallenge is to pick those set of paths (using vehicles) that perform\nrepresentative sampling in space and time. Most works in the literature for\nvehicle subset selection focus on maximizing the spatiotemporal coverage by\nmaximizing the number of samples for different locations and time stamps which\nis not an effective representative sampling strategy. We present regressive\nfacility location-based drive by sensing, an efficient vehicle selection\nframework that incorporates the smoothness in neighboring locations and\nautoregressive time correlation while selecting the optimal set of vehicles for\neffective spatiotemporal sampling. We show that the proposed drive by sensing\nproblem is submodular, thereby lending itself to a greedy algorithm but with\nperformance guarantees. We evaluate our framework on selecting a subset from\nthe fleet of public transport in Delhi, India. We illustrate that the proposed\nmethod samples the representative spatiotemporal data against the baseline\nmethods, reducing the extrapolation error on the simulated air quality data.\nOur method, therefore, has the potential to provide cost effective dense air\nquality maps.",

Hyperdimensional (HD) computing has evolved in recent years as\na new promising machine learning approach, especially when talking about\nwearable applications. But in the case of epilepsy detection, standard HD\ncomputing is not performing at the level of other state-of-the-art algorithms.\nThis could be due to the inherent complexity of the seizures and their\nsignatures in different biosignals, such as the electroencephalogram (EEG), the\nhighly personalized nature, and the disbalance of seizure and non-seizure\ninstances. In the literature, different strategies for improved learning of HD\ncomputing have been proposed, such as iterative (multi-pass) learning,\nmulti-centroid learning and learning with sample weight (\"OnlineHD\"). Yet, most\nof them have not been tested on the challenging task of epileptic seizure\ndetection, and it stays unclear whether they can increase the HD computing\nperformance to the level of the current state-of-the-art algorithms, such as\nrandom forests. Thus, in this paper, we implement different learning strategies\nand assess their performance on an individual basis, or in combination,\nregarding detection performance and memory and computational requirements.\nResults show that the best-performing algorithm, which is a combination of\nmulti-centroid and multi-pass, can indeed reach the performance of the random\nforest model on a highly unbalanced dataset imitating a real-life epileptic\nseizure detection application.",

    "abstract": "Standard model-free reinforcement learning algorithms optimize a policy that\ngenerates the action to be taken in the current time step in order to maximize\nexpected future return. While flexible, it faces difficulties arising from the\ninefficient exploration due to its single step nature. In this work, we present\nGenerative Planning method (GPM), which can generate actions not only for the\ncurrent step, but also for a number of future steps (thus termed as generative\nplanning). This brings several benefits to GPM. Firstly, since GPM is trained\nby maximizing value, the plans generated from it can be regarded as intentional\naction sequences for reaching high value regions. GPM can therefore leverage\nits generated multi-step plans for temporally coordinated exploration towards\nhigh value regions, which is potentially more effective than a sequence of\nactions generated by perturbing each action at single step level, whose\nconsistent movement decays exponentially with the number of exploration steps.\nSecondly, starting from a crude initial plan generator, GPM can refine it to be\nadaptive to the task, which, in return, benefits future explorations. This is\npotentially more effective than commonly used action-repeat strategy, which is\nnon-adaptive in its form of plans. Additionally, since the multi-step plan can\nbe interpreted as the intent of the agent from now to a span of time period\ninto the future, it offers a more informative and intuitive signal for\ninterpretation. Experiments are conducted on several benchmark environments and\nthe results demonstrated its effectiveness compared with several baseline\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "In a previous paper, we have shown that clause sets belonging to the Horn\nBernays-Sch\\\"onfinkel fragment over simple linear real arithmetic (HBS(SLR))\ncan be translated into HBS clause sets over a finite set of first-order\nconstants. The translation preserves validity and satisfiability and it is\nstill applicable if we extend our input with positive universally or\nexistentially quantified verification conditions (conjectures). We call this\ntranslation a Datalog hammer. The combination of its implementation in\nSPASS-SPL with the Datalog reasoner VLog establishes an effective way of\ndeciding verification conditions in the Horn fragment. We verify supervisor\ncode for two examples: a lane change assistant in a car and an electronic\ncontrol unit of a supercharged combustion engine. In this paper, we improve our\nDatalog hammer in several ways: we generalize it to mixed real-integer\narithmetic and finite first-order sorts; we extend the class of acceptable\ninequalities beyond variable bounds and positively grounded inequalities; and\nwe significantly reduce the size of the hammer output by a soft typing\ndiscipline. We call the result the sorted Datalog hammer. It not only allows us\nto handle more complex supervisor code and to model already considered\nsupervisor code more concisely, but it also improves our performance on real\nworld benchmark examples.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new two-step procedure for sparse-view tomographic\nimage reconstruction. It is called RISING, since it combines an early-stopped\nRapid Iterative Solver with a subsequent Iteration Network-based Gaining step.\nSo far, regularized iterative methods have widely been used for X-ray computed\ntomography image reconstruction from low-sampled data, since they converge to a\nsparse solution in a suitable domain, as upheld by the Compressed Sensing\ntheory. Unfortunately, their use is practically limited by their high\ncomputational cost which imposes to perform only a few iterations in the\navailable time for clinical exams. Data-driven methods, using neural networks\nto post-process a coarse and noisy image obtained from geometrical algorithms,\nhave been recently studied and appreciated for both their computational speed\nand accurate reconstructions. However, there is no evidence, neither\ntheoretically nor numerically, that neural networks based algorithms solve the\nmathematical inverse problem modeling the tomographic reconstruction process.\nIn our two-step approach, the first phase executes very few iterations of a\nregularized model-based algorithm whereas the second step completes the missing\niterations by means of a neural network. The resulting hybrid deep-variational\nframework preserves the convergence properties of the iterative method and, at\nthe same time, it exploits the computational speed and flexibility of a\ndata-driven approach. Experiments performed on a simulated and a real data set\nconfirm the numerical and visual accuracy of the reconstructed RISING images in\nshort computational times.",

    "abstract": "Although convolutional networks have been the dominant architecture for\nvision tasks for many years, recent experiments have shown that\nTransformer-based models, most notably the Vision Transformer (ViT), may exceed\ntheir performance in some settings. However, due to the quadratic runtime of\nthe self-attention layers in Transformers, ViTs require the use of patch\nembeddings, which group together small regions of the image into single input\nfeatures, in order to be applied to larger image sizes. This raises a question:\nIs the performance of ViTs due to the inherently-more-powerful Transformer\narchitecture, or is it at least partly due to using patches as the input\nrepresentation? In this paper, we present some evidence for the latter:\nspecifically, we propose the ConvMixer, an extremely simple model that is\nsimilar in spirit to the ViT and the even-more-basic MLP-Mixer in that it\noperates directly on patches as input, separates the mixing of spatial and\nchannel dimensions, and maintains equal size and resolution throughout the\nnetwork. In contrast, however, the ConvMixer uses only standard convolutions to\nachieve the mixing steps. Despite its simplicity, we show that the ConvMixer\noutperforms the ViT, MLP-Mixer, and some of their variants for similar\nparameter counts and data set sizes, in addition to outperforming classical\nvision models such as the ResNet.

    "title": "Spectral-PQ: A Novel Spectral Sensitivity-Orientated Perceptual  Compression Technique for RGB 4:4:4 Video Data",
    "abstract": "There exists an intrinsic relationship between the spectral sensitivity of\nthe Human Visual System (HVS) and colour perception; these intertwined\nphenomena are often overlooked in perceptual compression research. In general,\nmost previously proposed visually lossless compression techniques exploit\nluminance (luma) masking including luma spatiotemporal masking, luma contrast\nmasking and luma texture/edge masking. The perceptual relevance of color in a\npicture is often overlooked, which constitutes a gap in the literature. With\nregard to the spectral sensitivity phenomenon of the HVS, the color channels of\nraw RGB 4:4:4 data contain significant color-based psychovisual redundancies.\nThese perceptual redundancies can be quantized via color channel-level\nperceptual quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel spatiotemporal\nvisually lossless coding method named Spectral Perceptual Quantization\n(Spectral-PQ). With application for RGB 4:4:4 video data, Spectral-PQ exploits\nHVS spectral sensitivity-related color masking in addition to spatial masking\nand temporal masking; the proposed method operates at the Coding Block (CB)\nlevel and the Prediction Unit (PU) level in the HEVC standard. Spectral-PQ\nperceptually adjusts the Quantization Step Size (QStep) at the CB level if high\nvariance spatial data in G, B and R CBs is detected and also if high motion\nvector magnitudes in PUs are detected. Compared with anchor 1 (HEVC HM 16.17\nRExt), Spectral-PQ considerably reduces bitrates with a maximum reduction of\napproximately 81%. The Mean Opinion Score (MOS) in the subjective evaluations\nshow that Spectral-PQ successfully achieves perceptually lossless quality.",

    "abstract": "This proposes and discusses the category of supported sets which provides a\nuniform foundation for nominal sets of various kinds, such as those for\nequality symmetry, for the order symmetry, and renaming sets. We show that all\nthese differently flavoured categories of nominal sets are monadic over\nsupported sets. Thus, supported sets provide a canonical finite way to\nrepresent nominal sets and the automata therein, e.g. register automata. Name\nbinding in supported sets is modelled by a functor following the idea of de\nBruijn indices. This functor lifts to the well-known abstraction functor in\nnominal sets. Together with the monadicity result, this gives rise to a\ndeterminization process that takes the finite representation of a register\nautomaton in supported sets and transforms it into its configuration automaton\nin nominal sets.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of mixed precision capabilities in hardware, iterative\nrefinement schemes for solving linear systems $Ax=b$ have recently been\nrevisited and reanalyzed in the context of three or more precisions. These new\nanalyses show that under certain constraints on condition number, the LU\nfactorization of the matrix can be computed in low precision without affecting\nthe final accuracy. Another promising technique is GMRES-based iterative\nrefinement, which, in contrast to the standard approach, use GMRES\npreconditioned by the low-precision triangular factors to solve for the\napproximate solution update in each refinement step. This more accurate\nsolution method extends the range of problems which can be solved with a given\ncombination of precisions. However, in certain settings, GMRES may require too\nmany iterations per refinement step, making it potentially more expensive than\nsimply recomputing the LU factors in a higher precision.\nKrylov subspace recycling is a well-known technique for reusing information\nacross sequential invocations of a Krylov subspace method on systems with the\nsame or a slowly changing coefficient matrix. In this work, we incorporate the\nidea of Krylov subspace recycling into a mixed precision GMRES-based iterative\nrefinement solver. The insight is that in each refinement step, we call\npreconditioned GMRES on a linear system with the same coefficient matrix $A$,\nwith only the right-hand side changing. In this way, the GMRES solves in\nsubsequent refinement steps can be accelerated by recycling information\nobtained from the first step. We perform extensive numerical experiments on\nvarious random dense problems, Toeplitz problems (prolate matrices), and\nproblems from real applications, which confirm the benefits of the recycling\napproach.",

Due to\nconfidentiality guarantees, the NO cannot observe the nature of the traffic of\nSPs, which is encrypted. This makes resource allocation decisions challenging,\nsince they must be taken based solely on observed monitoring information. We\nfocus on one specific resource, i.e., cache space, deployed in some edge node,\ne.g., a base station. We study the decision of the NO about how to partition\ncache among several SPs in order to minimize the upstream traffic. Our goal is\nto optimize cache allocation using purely data-driven, model-free Reinforcement\nLearning (RL). Differently from most applications of RL, in which the decision\npolicy is learned offline on a simulator, we assume no previous knowledge is\navailable to build such a simulator. We thus apply RL in an \\emph{online}\nfashion, i.e., the policy is learned by directly perturbing the actual system\nand monitoring how its performance changes. Since perturbations generate\nspurious traffic, we also limit them. We show in simulation that our method\nrapidly converges toward the theoretical optimum, we study its fairness, its\nsensitivity to several scenario characteristics and compare it with a method\nfrom the state-of-the-art.",

However, while optimal control is well studied in the machine\nlearning and robotics community, less attention is placed on finding the\noptimal robot design. This is mainly because co-optimizing design and control\nin robotics is characterized as a challenging problem, and more importantly, a\ncomprehensive evaluation benchmark for co-optimization does not exist. In this\npaper, we propose Evolution Gym, the first large-scale benchmark for\nco-optimizing the design and control of soft robots. In our benchmark, each\nrobot is composed of different types of voxels (e.g., soft, rigid, actuators),\nresulting in a modular and expressive robot design space. Our benchmark\nenvironments span a wide range of tasks, including locomotion on various types\nof terrains and manipulation. Furthermore, we develop several robot\nco-evolution algorithms by combining state-of-the-art design optimization\nmethods and deep reinforcement learning techniques. Evaluating the algorithms\non our benchmark platform, we observe robots exhibiting increasingly complex\nbehaviors as evolution progresses, with the best evolved designs solving many\nof our proposed tasks.

However, this is not always the case for graph\ngenerative models (GGMs), making their evaluation challenging. Currently, the\nstandard process for evaluating GGMs suffers from three critical limitations:\ni) it does not produce a single score which makes model selection challenging,\nii) in many cases it fails to consider underlying edge and node features, and\niii) it is prohibitively slow to perform. In this work, we mitigate these\nissues by searching for scalar, domain-agnostic, and scalable metrics for\nevaluating and ranking GGMs. To this end, we study existing GGM metrics and\nneural-network-based metrics emerging from generative models of images that use\nembeddings extracted from a task-specific network. Motivated by the power of\ncertain Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract meaningful graph\nrepresentations without any training, we introduce several metrics based on the\nfeatures extracted by an untrained random GNN. We design experiments to\nthoroughly test metrics on their ability to measure the diversity and fidelity\nof generated graphs, as well as their sample and computational efficiency.\nDepending on the quantity of samples, we recommend one of two random-GNN-based\nmetrics that we show to be more expressive than pre-existing metrics.

    "title": "On the in vivo recognition of kidney stones using machine learning",
    "abstract": "Determining the type of kidney stones allows urologists to prescribe a\ntreatment to avoid recurrence of renal lithiasis. An automated in-vivo\nimage-based classification method would be an important step towards an\nimmediate identification of the kidney stone type required as a first phase of\nthe diagnosis. In the literature it was shown on ex-vivo data (i.e., in very\ncontrolled scene and image acquisition conditions) that an automated kidney\nstone classification is indeed feasible. This pilot study compares the kidney\nstone recognition performances of six shallow machine learning methods and\nthree deep-learning architectures which were tested with in-vivo images of the\nfour most frequent urinary calculi types acquired with an endoscope during\nstandard ureteroscopies. This contribution details the database construction\nand the design of the tested kidney stones classifiers. Even if the best\nresults were obtained by the Inception v3 architecture (weighted precision,\nrecall and F1-score of 0.97, 0.98 and 0.97, respectively), it is also shown\nthat choosing an appropriate colour space and texture features allows a shallow\nmachine learning method to approach closely the performances of the most\npromising deep-learning methods (the XGBoost classifier led to weighted\nprecision, recall and F1-score values of 0.96). This paper is the first one\nthat explores the most discriminant features to be extracted from images\nacquired during ureteroscopies.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging research area advocating the\nuse of quantum computing for advancement in machine learning. Since the\ndiscovery of the capability of Parametrized Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC)\nto replace Artificial Neural Networks, they have been widely adopted to\ndifferent tasks in Quantum Machine Learning. However, despite their potential\nto outperform neural networks, VQCs are limited to small scale applications\ngiven the challenges in scalability of quantum circuits. To address this\nshortcoming, we propose an algorithm that compresses the quantum state within\nthe circuit using a tensor ring representation. Using the input qubit state in\nthe tensor ring representation, single qubit gates maintain the tensor ring\nrepresentation. However, the same is not true for two qubit gates in general,\nwhere an approximation is used to have the output as a tensor ring\nrepresentation. Using this approximation, the storage and computational time\nincreases linearly in the number of qubits and number of layers, as compared to\nthe exponential increase with exact simulation algorithms. This approximation\nis used to implement the tensor ring VQC. The training of the parameters of\ntensor ring VQC is performed using a gradient descent based algorithm, where\nefficient approaches for backpropagation are used. The proposed approach is\nevaluated on two datasets: Iris and MNIST for the classification task to show\nthe improved accuracy using more number of qubits. We achieve a test accuracy\nof 83.33\\% on Iris dataset and a maximum of 99.30\\% and 76.31\\% on binary and\nternary classification of MNIST dataset using various circuit architectures.\nThe results from the IRIS dataset outperform the results on VQC implemented on\nQiskit, and being scalable, demonstrates the potential for VQCs to be used for\nlarge scale Quantum Machine Learning applications.",

    "abstract": "We resolve an open problem of Hanneke on the subject of universally\nconsistent online learning with non-i.i.d. processes and unbounded losses. The\nnotion of an optimistically universal learning rule was defined by Hanneke in\nan effort to study learning theory under minimal assumptions. A given learning\nrule is said to be optimistically universal if it achieves a low long-run\naverage loss whenever the data generating process makes this goal achievable by\nsome learning rule. Hanneke posed as an open problem whether, for every\nunbounded loss, the family of processes admitting universal learning are\nprecisely those having a finite number of distinct values almost surely. In\nthis paper, we completely resolve this problem, showing that this is indeed the\ncase. As a consequence, this also offers a dramatically simpler formulation of\nan optimistically universal learning rule for any unbounded loss: namely, the\nsimple memorization rule already suffices. Our proof relies on constructing\nrandom measurable partitions of the instance space and could be of independent\ninterest for solving other open questions. We extend the results to the\nnon-realizable setting thereby providing an optimistically universal Bayes\nconsistent learning rule.",

It\nwas shown that wav2vec2.0 has a good robustness against the domain shift, while\nthe noise robustness is still unclear. In this work, we therefore first analyze\nthe noise robustness of wav2vec2.0 via experiments. We observe that wav2vec2.0\npre-trained on noisy data can obtain good representations and thus improve the\nASR performance on the noisy test set, which however brings a performance\ndegradation on the clean test set. To avoid this issue, in this work we propose\nan enhanced wav2vec2.0 model. Specifically, the noisy speech and the\ncorresponding clean version are fed into the same feature encoder, where the\nclean speech provides training targets for the model. Experimental results\nreveal that the proposed method can not only improve the ASR performance on the\nnoisy test set which surpasses the original wav2vec2.0, but also ensure a tiny\nperformance decrease on the clean test set.

    "abstract": "A decentralized approach for joint frequency and phase synchronization in\ndistributed antenna arrays is presented. The nodes in the array share their\nfrequencies and phases with their neighboring nodes to align these parameters\nacross the array. Our signal model includes the frequency drifts and phase\njitters of the local oscillators as well as the frequency and phase estimation\nerrors at the nodes and models them using practical statistics. A decentralized\nfrequency and phase consensus (DFPC) algorithm is proposed which uses an\naverage consensus method in which each node in the array iteratively updates\nits frequency and phase by computing an average of the frequencies and phases\nof their neighboring nodes. Simulation results show that upon convergence the\nDFPC algorithm can align the frequencies and phases of all the nodes up to a\nresidual phase error that is governed by the oscillators and the estimation\nerrors. To reduce this residual phase error and thus improve the\nsynchronization between the nodes, a Kalman filter based decentralized\nfrequency and phase consensus (KF-DFPC) algorithm is presented. The total\nresidual phase error at the convergence of the KF-DFPC and DFPC algorithms is\nderived theoretically. The synchronization performances of these algorithms are\ncompared to each other in light of this theoretical residual phase error by\nvarying the duration of the signals, connectivity of the nodes, the number of\nnodes in the array, and signal to noise ratio of the transmitted signals.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed KF-DFPC algorithm converges in\nfewer iterations than the DFPC algorithm. Furthermore, for shorter intervals\nbetween local information broadcasts, the KF-DFPC algorithm significantly\noutperforms the DFPC algorithm in reducing the residual total phase error,\nirrespective of the signal to noise ratio of the received signals.",

Graph\nconvolutional networks (GCNs) in particular, inspired by their Euclidean\ncounterparts, have been successful in processing graph data by extracting\nstructure-aware features.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have shown great success in\nquantitative investment tasks, such as portfolio management and algorithmic\ntrading. Especially, intraday trading is one of the most profitable and risky\ntasks because of the intraday behaviors of the financial market that reflect\nbillions of rapidly fluctuating values. However, it is hard to apply existing\nRL methods to intraday trading due to the following three limitations: 1)\noverlooking micro-level market information (e.g., limit order book); 2) only\nfocusing on local price fluctuation and failing to capture the overall trend of\nthe whole trading day; 3) neglecting the impact of market risk. To tackle these\nlimitations, we propose DeepScalper, a deep reinforcement learning framework\nfor intraday trading. Specifically, we adopt an encoder-decoder architecture to\nlearn robust market embedding incorporating both macro-level and micro-level\nmarket information. Moreover, a novel hindsight reward function is designed to\nprovide the agent a long-term horizon for capturing the overall price trend. In\naddition, we propose a risk-aware auxiliary task by predicting future\nvolatility, which helps the agent take market risk into consideration while\nmaximizing profit. Finally, extensive experiments on two stock index futures\nand four treasury bond futures demonstrate that DeepScalper achieves\nsignificant improvement against many state-of-the-art approaches.",

Physical measurements are post-processed by\nmathematical reconstruction algorithms that may offer weaker or top-notch\nconsistency guarantees on the computed volumetric field. Superior results are\nprovided on the account of an abundance of low-noise measurements being\nsupplied. Nonetheless, such a scanning process would expose the examined body\nto an undesirably large-intensity and long-lasting ionising radiation, imposing\nsevere health risks. One main objective of the ongoing research is the\nreduction of the number of projections while keeping the quality performance\nstable. Due to the under-sampling, the noise occurring inherently because of\nphoton-electron interactions is now supplemented by reconstruction artifacts.\nRecently, deep learning methods, especially fully convolutional networks have\nbeen extensively investigated and proven to be efficient in filtering such\ndeviations. In this report algorithms are presented that take as input a slice\nof a low-quality reconstruction of the volume in question and aim to map it to\nthe reconstruction that is considered ideal, the ground truth. Above that, the\nfirst system comprises two additional elements: firstly, it ensures the\nconsistency with the measured sinogram, secondly it adheres to constraints\nproposed in classical compressive sampling theory.

In CT images, pulmonary fissure segmentation is a formidable mission\ndue to various of factors. To address the challenge, an useful approach based\non ODoS filter and shape features is presented for pulmonary fissure\nsegmentation. Here, we adopt an ODoS filter by merging the orientation\ninformation and magnitude information to highlight structure features for\nfissure enhancement, which can effectively distinguish between pulmonary\nfissures and clutters. Motivated by the fact that pulmonary fissures appear as\nlinear structures in 2D space and planar structures in 3D space in orientation\nfield, an orientation curvature criterion and an orientation partition scheme\nare fused to separate fissure patches and other structures in different\norientation partition, which can suppress parts of clutters. Considering the\nshape difference between pulmonary fissures and tubular structures in magnitude\nfield, a shape measure approach and a 3D skeletonization model are combined to\nsegment pulmonary fissures for clutters removal. When applying our scheme to 55\nchest CT scans which acquired from a publicly available LOLA11 datasets, the\nmedian F1-score, False Discovery Rate (FDR), and False Negative Rate (FNR)\nrespectively are 0.896, 0.109, and 0.100, which indicates that the presented\nmethod has a satisfactory pulmonary fissure segmentation performance.",

We model causal structures by a directed acyclic graph that is\nparameterized with generalized linear models, so that our method is applicable\nto various types of data. To obtain a high-scoring causal graph, DARLS\nsimulates an annealing process to search over the space of topological sorts,\nwhere the optimal graphical structure compatible with a sort is found by a\ndistributed optimization method. This distributed optimization relies on\nmultiple rounds of communication between local and central machines to estimate\nthe optimal structure. We establish its convergence to a global optimizer of\nthe overall score that is computed on all data across local machines. To the\nbest of our knowledge, DARLS is the first distributed method for learning\ncausal graphs with such theoretical guarantees. Through extensive simulation\nstudies, DARLS has shown competing performance against existing methods on\ndistributed data, and achieved comparable structure learning accuracy and\ntest-data likelihood with competing methods applied to pooled data across all\nlocal machines. In a real-world application for modeling protein-DNA binding\nnetworks with distributed ChIP-Sequencing data, DARLS also exhibits higher\npredictive power than other methods, demonstrating a great advantage in\nestimating causal networks from distributed data.",

    "abstract": "Accelerating magnetic resonance image (MRI) reconstruction process is a\nchallenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the excessive under-sampling\noperation in k-space. In this paper, we propose a recurrent transformer model,\nnamely \\textbf{ReconFormer}, for MRI reconstruction which can iteratively\nreconstruct high fertility magnetic resonance images from highly under-sampled\nk-space data. In particular, the proposed architecture is built upon Recurrent\nPyramid Transformer Layers (RPTL), which jointly exploits intrinsic multi-scale\ninformation at every architecture unit as well as the dependencies of the deep\nfeature correlation through recurrent states. Moreover, the proposed\nReconFormer is lightweight since it employs the recurrent structure for its\nparameter efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of ReconFormer on multiple\ndatasets with different magnetic resonance sequences and show that it achieves\nsignificant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods with better\nparameter efficiency. Implementation code will be available in\nhttps://github.com/guopengf/ReconFormer.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-radiative and\nnon-invasive method for clinical interrogation of organ structures and\nmetabolism, with an inherently long scanning time. Methods by k-space\nundersampling and deep learning based reconstruction have been popularised to\naccelerate the scanning process. This work focuses on investigating how\npowerful transformers are for fast MRI by exploiting and comparing different\nnovel network architectures. In particular, a generative adversarial network\n(GAN) based Swin transformer (ST-GAN) was introduced for the fast MRI\nreconstruction. To further preserve the edge and texture information, edge\nenhanced GAN based Swin transformer (EESGAN) and texture enhanced GAN based\nSwin transformer (TES-GAN) were also developed, where a dual-discriminator GAN\nstructure was applied. We compared our proposed GAN based transformers,\nstandalone Swin transformer and other convolutional neural networks based based\nGAN model in terms of the evaluation metrics PSNR, SSIM and FID. We showed that\ntransformers work well for the MRI reconstruction from different undersampling\nconditions. The utilisation of GAN's adversarial structure improves the quality\nof images reconstructed when undersampled for 30% or higher.",

    "abstract": "Dysarthric speech recognition is a challenging task due to acoustic\nvariability and limited amount of available data. Diverse conditions of\ndysarthric speakers account for the acoustic variability, which make the\nvariability difficult to be modeled precisely. This paper presents a\nvariational auto-encoder based variability encoder (VAEVE) to explicitly encode\nsuch variability for dysarthric speech. The VAEVE makes use of both phoneme\ninformation and low-dimensional latent variable to reconstruct the input\nacoustic features, thereby the latent variable is forced to encode the\nphoneme-independent variability. Stochastic gradient variational Bayes\nalgorithm is applied to model the distribution for generating variability\nencodings, which are further used as auxiliary features for DNN acoustic\nmodeling. Experiment results conducted on the UASpeech corpus show that the\nVAEVE based variability encodings have complementary effect to the learning\nhidden unit contributions (LHUC) speaker adaptation. The systems using\nvariability encodings consistently outperform the comparable baseline systems\nwithout using them, and\" obtain absolute word error rate (WER) reduction by up\nto 2.2% on dysarthric speech with \"Very lowintelligibility level, and up to 2%\non the \"Mixed\" type of dysarthric speech with diverse or uncertain conditions.",

In the other approach, we\nmodel the acoustic information for all the languages simultaneously by training\na multitask DNN (MTDNN) to predict the senones of each language in different\noutput layers. The cross-entropy loss and the weight update procedure are\nmodified such that only the shared layers and the output layer responsible for\npredicting the senone classes of a language are updated during training, if the\nfeature vector belongs to that particular language.

Ethanol of area-equivalent radius about 1.29 mm was\ndropped from impact heights ranging from 4 cm to 60 cm (splashing threshold 20\ncm) and impacted on a hydrophilic surface. The images captured when half of the\ndrop impacted the surface were labeled according to their outcome, splashing or\nnonsplashing, and were used to train an FNN. A classification accuracy higher\nthan 96% was achieved. To extract the image features identified by the FNN for\nclassification, the weight matrix of the trained FNN for identifying splashing\ndrops was visualized. Remarkably, the visualization showed that the trained FNN\nidentified the contour height of the main body of the impacting drop as an\nimportant characteristic differentiating between splashing and nonsplashing\ndrops, which has not been reported in previous studies. This feature was found\nthroughout the impact, even when one and three-quarters of the drop impacted\nthe surface. To confirm the importance of this image feature, the FNN was\nretrained to classify using only the main body without checking for the\npresence of ejected secondary droplets. The accuracy was still higher than 82%,\nconfirming that the contour height is an important feature distinguishing\nsplashing from nonsplashing drops. Several aspects of drop impact are analyzed\nand discussed with the aim of identifying the possible mechanism underlying the\ndifference in contour height between splashing and nonsplashing drops.",

This function is surprisingly\ndifficult to study; in particular, the conjecture that $p_{\\mathbf{u}}(n)$ can\nbe bounded only if $\\mathbf{u}$ is ultimately periodic is open since 2013. A\nmore recent conjecture concerns the prefix palindromic length of the period\ndoubling word: it seems that it is not $2$-regular, and if it is true, this\nwould give a rare if not unique example of a non-regular function of a\n$2$-automatic word.\nFor some other $k$-automatic words, however, the prefix palindromic length is\nknown to be $k$-regular.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes PickNet, a neural network model for real-time channel\nselection for an ad hoc microphone array consisting of multiple recording\ndevices like cell phones. Assuming at most one person to be vocally active at\neach time point, PickNet identifies the device that is spatially closest to the\nactive person for each time frame by using a short spectral patch of just\nhundreds of milliseconds. The model is applied to every time frame, and the\nshort time frame signals from the selected microphones are concatenated across\nthe frames to produce an output signal. As the personal devices are usually\nheld close to their owners, the output signal is expected to have higher\nsignal-to-noise and direct-to-reverberation ratios on average than the input\nsignals. Since PickNet utilizes only limited acoustic context at each time\nframe, the system using the proposed model works in real time and is robust to\nchanges in acoustic conditions. Speech recognition-based evaluation was carried\nout by using real conversational recordings obtained with various smartphones.\nThe proposed model yielded significant gains in word error rate with limited\ncomputational cost over systems using a block-online beamformer and a single\ndistant microphone.",

Unlike state-feedback\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), static output-feedback policies are typically\ninsufficient to achieve good closed-loop control performance. We investigate\nthe optimization landscape of linear quadratic control using dynamical output\nfeedback policies, denoted as dynamical LQR (dLQR) in this paper. We first show\nthat the dLQR cost varies with similarity transformations. We then derive an\nexplicit form of the optimal similarity transformation for a given observable\nstabilizing controller. We further characterize the unique observable\nstationary point of dLQR. This provides an optimality certificate for policy\ngradient methods under mild assumptions. Finally, we discuss the differences\nand connections between dLQR and the canonical linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG)\ncontrol.

    "abstract": "The AlphaFold computer program predicted protein structures for the whole\nhuman genome, which has been considered as a remarkable breakthrough both in\nartificial intelligence (AI) application and structural biology. Despite the\nvarying confidence level, these predicted structures still could significantly\ncontribute to the structure-based drug design of novel targets, especially the\nones with no or limited structural information. In this work, we successfully\napplied AlphaFold in our end-to-end AI-powered drug discovery engines\nconstituted of a biocomputational platform PandaOmics and a generative\nchemistry platform Chemistry42, to identify a first-in-class hit molecule of a\nnovel target without an experimental structure starting from target selection\ntowards hit identification in a cost- and time-efficient manner. PandaOmics\nprovided the targets of interest and Chemistry42 generated the molecules based\non the AlphaFold predicted structure, and the selected molecules were\nsynthesized and tested in biological assays. Through this approach, we\nidentified a small molecule hit compound for CDK20 with a Kd value of 8.9 +/-\n1.6 uM (n = 4) within 30 days from target selection and after only synthesizing\n7 compounds.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of additive manufacturing, microstructures are\nattracting both academic and industrial interests. As an efficient way of\nanalyzing the mechanical behaviors of microstructures, the homogenization\nmethod has been well studied in the literature. However, the classic\nhomogenization method still faces challenges. Its computational cost is high\nfor topological optimization that requires highly repeated calculation. The\ncomputation is more expensive when the microstructure is deformed from a\nregular cubic, causing changes for the virtual homogeneous material properties.\nTo conquer this problem, we introduce a fine-designed 3D convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN), named DH-Net, to predict the homogenized properties of deformed\nmicrostructures. The novelty of DH-Net is that it predicts the local\ndisplacement rather than the homogenized properties. The macroscopic strains\nare considered as a constant in the loss function based on minimum potential\nenergy. Thus DH-Net is label-free and more computation efficient than existing\ndeep learning methods with the mean square loss function. We apply the\nshape-material transformation that a deformed microstructure with isotropic\nmaterial can be bi-transformed into a regular structure with a transformed base\nmaterial, such that the input with a CNN-friendly form feeds in DH-Net. DH-Net\npredicts homogenized properties with hundreds of acceleration compared to the\nstandard homogenization method and even supports online computing. Moreover, it\ndoes not require a labeled dataset and thus can be much faster than current\ndeep learning methods in training processing. DH-Net can predict both\nhomogenized material properties and micro-mechanical properties, which is\nunavailable for existing DL methods. The generalization of DH-Net for different\nbase materials and different types of microstructures is also taken into\naccount.",

CubeSats are particularly attractive\ndue to their low development costs which makes them very promising in playing a\ncentral role in the global wireless communication sector with numerous\napplications. Moreover, constellations of CubeSats in low-earth orbits can meet\nthe increasing demands of global-coverage flexible low-cost high-speed\nconnectivity. However, this requires innovative solutions to overcome the\nsignificant challenges that face high-data-rate low-power space communications.\nThis paper provides a comprehensive and critical review of the design and\narchitecture of recent CubeSat communication systems with a particular focus on\ntheir baseband architectures. The literature is surveyed in detail to identify\nall baseband design, testing, and demonstration stages as well as accurately\ndescribe the systems architecture and communication protocols. The reliability,\nperformance, data rate, and power consumption of the reviewed systems are\ncritically evaluated to understand the limitations of current CubeSat systems\nand identify directions of future developments. It is concluded that CubeSat\ncommunication systems still face many challenges, namely the development of\nenergy-efficient high-speed modems that satisfy CubeSats requirements.\nNevertheless, there are several promising directions for improvements such as\nthe use of improved coding algorithms, use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays,\nmultiple access techniques, beamforming, advanced antennas, and transition to\nhigher frequency bands. By providing a concrete summary of current CubeSat\ncommunication systems and by critically evaluating their features, limitations,\nand offering insights about potential improvements, the review should aid\nCubeSat developers to develop more efficient and high data rate systems.",

Then, a binary\nseries is generated from the first difference of Bitcoin exchange rate (against\nthe United States Dollar). Finally, the minimum number of parameters describing\nthe linear laws of this series is identified through stepped time windows.\nBased on the results, linear laws typically became more complex (containing an\nadditional third parameter that indicates hidden Markov property) in two\nperiods: before the crash of cryptocurrency markets inducted by the COVID-19\npandemic (12 March 2020), and before the record-breaking surge in the price of\nBitcoin (Q4 2020 - Q1 2021).

    "abstract": "Recently, variational autoencoder (VAE), a deep representation learning (DRL)\nmodel, has been used to perform speech enhancement (SE). However, to the best\nof our knowledge, current VAE-based SE methods only apply VAE to the model\nspeech signal, while noise is modeled using the traditional non-negative matrix\nfactorization (NMF) model. One of the most important reasons for using NMF is\nthat these VAE-based methods cannot disentangle the speech and noise latent\nvariables from the observed signal. Based on Bayesian theory, this paper\nderives a novel variational lower bound for VAE, which ensures that VAE can be\ntrained in supervision, and can disentangle speech and noise latent variables\nfrom the observed signal. This means that the proposed method can apply the VAE\nto model both speech and noise signals, which is totally different from the\nprevious VAE-based SE works. More specifically, the proposed DRL method can\nlearn to impose speech and noise signal priors to different sets of latent\nvariables for SE. The experimental results show that the proposed method can\nnot only disentangle speech and noise latent variables from the observed signal\nbut also obtain a higher scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio and speech\nquality score than the similar deep neural network-based (DNN) SE method.",
