    "abstract": "The transport of traffic flow can be modeled by the advection equation.\nFinite difference and finite volumes methods have been used to numerically\nsolve this hyperbolic equation on a mesh. Advection has also been modeled\ndiscretely on directed graphs using the graph advection operator [4, 18]. In\nthis paper, we first show that we can reformulate this graph advection operator\nas a finite difference scheme. We then propose the Directed Graph Advection\nMat\\'ern Gaussian Process (DGAMGP) model that incorporates the dynamics of this\ngraph advection operator into the kernel of a trainable Mat\\'ern Gaussian\nProcess to effectively model traffic flow and its uncertainty as an advective\nprocess on a directed graph.",

    "abstract": "The time dependent spectral renormalization (TDSR) method was introduced by\nCole and Musslimani as a novel way to numerically solve initial boundary value\nproblems. An important and novel aspect of the TDSR scheme is its ability to\nincorporate physics in the form of conservation laws or dissipation rate\nequations. However, the method was limited to include a single conserved or\ndissipative quantity. The present work significantly extends the computational\nfeatures of the method with the (i) incorporation of multiple conservation laws\nand/or dissipation rate equations, (ii) ability to enforce versatile boundary\nconditions, and (iii) higher order time integration strategy. The TDSR method\nis applied on several prototypical evolution equations of physical\nsignificance.

With far fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models,\nthe offline training of our model is significantly faster in terms of tuning\nand computation (with a reduction of up to $90\\%$ on training time and network\nparameters).

This scheme finds a partner for each connected\nuser such that the user's and its partner's weights are the closest among all\nthe weights uploaded.

    "abstract": "A key challenge for AI is to build embodied systems that operate in\ndynamically changing environments. Such systems must adapt to changing task\ncontexts and learn continuously. Although standard deep learning systems\nachieve state of the art results on static benchmarks, they often struggle in\ndynamic scenarios. In these settings, error signals from multiple contexts can\ninterfere with one another, ultimately leading to a phenomenon known as\ncatastrophic forgetting. In this article we investigate biologically inspired\narchitectures as solutions to these problems. Specifically, we show that the\nbiophysical properties of dendrites and local inhibitory systems enable\nnetworks to dynamically restrict and route information in a context-specific\nmanner. Our key contributions are as follows. First, we propose a novel\nartificial neural network architecture that incorporates active dendrites and\nsparse representations into the standard deep learning framework. Next, we\nstudy the performance of this architecture on two separate benchmarks requiring\ntask-based adaptation: Meta-World, a multi-task reinforcement learning\nenvironment where a robotic agent must learn to solve a variety of manipulation\ntasks simultaneously; and a continual learning benchmark in which the model's\nprediction task changes throughout training. Analysis on both benchmarks\ndemonstrates the emergence of overlapping but distinct and sparse subnetworks,\nallowing the system to fluidly learn multiple tasks with minimal forgetting.\nOur neural implementation marks the first time a single architecture has\nachieved competitive results on both multi-task and continual learning\nsettings.

In contrast, we advocate a multi-dimensional ViT compression paradigm,\nand propose to harness the redundancy reduction from attention head, neuron and\nsequence dimensions jointly. We firstly propose a statistical dependence based\npruning criterion that is generalizable to different dimensions for identifying\ndeleterious components. Moreover, we cast the multi-dimensional compression as\nan optimization, learning the optimal pruning policy across the three\ndimensions that maximizes the compressed model's accuracy under a computational\nbudget. The problem is solved by our adapted Gaussian process search with\nexpected improvement. Experimental results show that our method effectively\nreduces the computational cost of various ViT models. For example, our method\nreduces 40\\% FLOPs without top-1 accuracy loss for DeiT and T2T-ViT models,\noutperforming previous state-of-the-arts.",

    "title": "Transformer Embeddings of Irregularly Spaced Events and Their  Participants",
    "abstract": "We propose an approach to modeling irregularly spaced sequences of discrete\nevents. We begin with a continuous-time variant of the Transformer, which was\noriginally formulated (Vaswani et al., 2017) for sequences without timestamps.\nWe embed a possible event (or other boolean fact) at time $t$ by using\nattention over the events that occurred at times $< t$ (and the facts that were\ntrue when they occurred). We control this attention using pattern-matching\nlogic rules that relate events and facts that share participants. These rules\ndetermine which previous events will be attended to, as well as how to\ntransform the embeddings of the events and facts into the attentional queries,\nkeys, and values. Other logic rules describe how to change the set of facts in\nresponse to events. Our approach closely follows Mei et al. (2020a), and adopts\ntheir Datalog Through Time formalism for logic rules. As in that work, a domain\nexpert first writes a set of logic rules that establishes the set of possible\nevents and other facts at each time $t$. Each possible event or other fact is\nembedded using a neural architecture that is derived from the rules that\nestablished it. Our only difference from Mei et al. (2020a) is that we derive a\nflatter, attention-based neural architecture whereas they used a more serial\nLSTM architecture. We find that our attention-based approach performs about\nequally well on the RoboCup dataset, where the logic rules play an important\nrole in improving performance. We also compared these two methods with two\nprevious attention-based methods (Zuo et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a) on\nsimpler synthetic and real domains without logic rules, and found our proposed\napproach to be at least as good, and sometimes better, than each of the other\nthree methods.",

We achieve\nthis by measuring the change in predictive performance of a music mood/theme\nclassifier after augmenting its training data with generated samples. We\nanalyse music samples generated by three models -- SampleRNN, Jukebox, and DDSP\n-- and employ a homogeneous framework across all methods to allow for objective\ncomparison.

This is infeasible without expensive hardware that can process\ncomplex operations -- such as object detection -- within a short time. Many\napproach this problem by addressing the complexity of the models -- via model\ncompression, pruning and quantization -- or compressing the input. In this\npaper, we propose a different perspective when addressing the performance\nchallenges. Croesus is a multi-stage approach to edge-cloud systems that\nprovides the ability to find the balance between accuracy and performance.\nCroesus consists of two stages (that can be generalized to multiple stages): an\ninitial and a final stage. The initial stage performs the computation in\nreal-time using approximate/best-effort computation at the edge. The final\nstage performs the full computation at the cloud, and uses the results to\ncorrect any errors made at the initial stage. In this paper, we demonstrate the\nimplications of such an approach on a video analytics use-case and show how\nmulti-stage processing yields a better balance between accuracy and\nperformance.

In this work, we assume access to a small number\nof group labels alongside a larger dataset without group labels. We propose\nBARACK, a simple two-step framework to utilize this partial group information\nto improve worst-group performance: train a model to predict the missing group\nlabels for the training data, and then use these predicted group labels in a\nrobust optimization objective. Theoretically, we provide generalization bounds\nfor our approach in terms of the worst-group performance, showing how the\ngeneralization error scales with respect to both the total number of training\npoints and the number of training points with group labels.

However, technology to resolve these problems tends\nto improve as well. One of the earliest existing problems which started with\nthe invention of vehicles was parking. The ease of resolving this problem using\ntechnology has evolved over the years but the problem of parking still remains\nunsolved. The main reason behind this is that parking does not only involve one\nproblem but it consists of a set of problems within itself. One of these\nproblems is the occupancy detection of the parking slots in a distributed\nparking ecosystem. In a distributed system, users would find preferable parking\nspaces as opposed to random parking spaces. In this paper, we propose a\nweb-based application as a solution for parking space detection in different\nparking spaces. The solution is based on Computer Vision (CV) and is built\nusing the Django framework written in Python 3.0. The solution works to resolve\nthe occupancy detection problem along with providing the user the option to\ndetermine the block based on availability and his preference.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new framework to predict visual attention of\nomnidirectional images. The key setup of our architecture is the simultaneous\nprediction of the saliency map and a corresponding scanpath for a given\nstimulus. The framework implements a fully encoder-decoder convolutional neural\nnetwork augmented by an attention module to generate representative saliency\nmaps. In addition, an auxiliary network is employed to generate probable\nviewport center fixation points through the SoftArgMax function. The latter\nallows to derive fixation points from feature maps. To take advantage of the\nscanpath prediction, an adaptive joint probability distribution model is then\napplied to construct the final unbiased saliency map by leveraging the encoder\ndecoder-based saliency map and the scanpath-based saliency heatmap. The\nproposed framework was evaluated in terms of saliency and scanpath prediction,\nand the results were compared to state-of-the-art methods on Salient360!\ndataset. The results showed the relevance of our framework and the benefits of\nsuch architecture for further omnidirectional visual attention prediction\ntasks.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can fool\ndeep models by adding subtle perturbations. Although existing attacks have\nachieved promising results, it still leaves a long way to go for generating\ntransferable adversarial examples under the black-box setting. To this end,\nthis paper proposes to improve the transferability of adversarial examples, and\napplies dual-stage feature-level perturbations to an existing model to\nimplicitly create a set of diverse models. Then these models are fused by the\nlongitudinal ensemble during the iterations. The proposed method is termed\nDual-Stage Network Erosion (DSNE). We conduct comprehensive experiments both on\nnon-residual and residual networks, and obtain more transferable adversarial\nexamples with the computational cost similar to the state-of-the-art method. In\nparticular, for the residual networks, the transferability of the adversarial\nexamples can be significantly improved by biasing the residual block\ninformation to the skip connections. Our work provides new insights into the\narchitectural vulnerability of neural networks and presents new challenges to\nthe robustness of neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Preliminary mission design requires an efficient and accurate approximation\nto the low-thrust rendezvous trajectories, which might be generally\nthree-dimensional and involve multiple revolutions. In this paper, a new\nshaping method using cubic spline functions is developed for the analytical\napproximation, which shows advantages in the optimality and computational\nefficiency. The rendezvous constraints on the boundary states and transfer time\nare all satisfied analytically, under the assumption that the boundary\nconditions and segment numbers of cubic spline functions are designated in\nadvance. Two specific shapes are then formulated according to whether they have\nfree optimization parameters. The shape without free parameters provides an\nefficient and robust estimation, while the other one allows a subsequent\noptimization for the satisfaction of additional constraints such as the\nconstraint on the thrust magnitude. Applications of the proposed method in\ncombination with the particle swarm optimization algorithm are discussed\nthrough two typical interplanetary rendezvous missions, that is, an inclined\nmulti-revolution trajectory from the Earth to asteroid Dionysus and a\nmulti-rendezvous trajectory of sample return. Simulation examples show that the\nproposed method is superior to existing methods in terms of providing good\nestimation for the global search and generating suitable initial guess for the\nsubsequent trajectory optimization.",

In this study, we reveal the core challenges in this research area:\nhow to synthesize robust region features (for unseen objects) that are as\nintra-class diverse and inter-class separable as the real samples, so that\nstrong unseen object detectors can be trained upon them. To address these\nchallenges, we build a novel zero-shot object detection framework that contains\nan Intra-class Semantic Diverging component and an Inter-class Structure\nPreserving component.

    "abstract": "Occlusion poses a major challenge for person re-identification (ReID).\nExisting approaches typically rely on outside tools to infer visible body\nparts, which may be suboptimal in terms of both computational efficiency and\nReID accuracy. In particular, they may fail when facing complex occlusions,\nsuch as those between pedestrians. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel method named Quality-aware Part Models (QPM) for occlusion-robust ReID.\nFirst, we propose to jointly learn part features and predict part quality\nscores. As no quality annotation is available, we introduce a strategy that\nautomatically assigns low scores to occluded body parts, thereby weakening the\nimpact of occluded body parts on ReID results. Second, based on the predicted\npart quality scores, we propose a novel identity-aware spatial attention (ISA)\nmodule. In this module, a coarse identity-aware feature is utilized to\nhighlight pixels of the target pedestrian, so as to handle the occlusion\nbetween pedestrians. Third, we design an adaptive and efficient approach for\ngenerating global features from common non-occluded regions with respect to\neach image pair. This design is crucial, but is often ignored by existing\nmethods. QPM has three key advantages: 1) it does not rely on any outside tools\nin either the training or inference stages; 2) it handles occlusions caused by\nboth objects and other pedestrians;3) it is highly computationally efficient.\nExperimental results on four popular databases for occluded ReID demonstrate\nthat QPM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant\nmargins. The code of QPM will be released.",

To address\nthis problem, knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely employed, that uses a\npre-trained high capacity network to train a much smaller network, suitable for\nedge devices. In this paper, for the first time, we study the applicability and\nchallenges of using KD for time-series data for wearable devices. Successful\napplication of KD requires specific choices of data augmentation methods during\ntraining. However, it is not yet known if there exists a coherent strategy for\nchoosing an augmentation approach during KD. In this paper, we report the\nresults of a detailed study that compares and contrasts various common choices\nand some hybrid data augmentation strategies in KD based human activity\nanalysis. Research in this area is often limited as there are not many\ncomprehensive databases available in the public domain from wearable devices.\nOur study considers databases from small scale publicly available to one\nderived from a large scale interventional study into human activity and\nsedentary behavior. We find that the choice of data augmentation techniques\nduring KD have a variable level of impact on end performance, and find that the\noptimal network choice as well as data augmentation strategies are specific to\na dataset at hand.

We\nfirst design an analytical framework for evaluating vehicle tracking systems\nbased on the extended Kalman filter. A simple, yet effective, metric that\nquantifies the vehicle tracking performance is derived in terms of the angular\nderivative of a dominant spatial frequency. Second, an RSU selection algorithm\nis proposed to select a proper RSU that enhances the vehicle tracking\nperformance. A joint vehicle tracking algorithm is also developed to maximize\nthe tracking performance by considering sounding samples at multiple RSUs while\nminimizing the amount of sample exchange. The numerical results verify that the\nproposed vehicle tracking algorithms give better performance than conventional\nsignal-to-noise ratio-based tracking systems using a single RSU.",

    "title": "Toward Pareto Efficient Fairness-Utility Trade-off inRecommendation  through Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "The issue of fairness in recommendation is becoming increasingly essential as\nRecommender Systems touch and influence more and more people in their daily\nlives. In fairness-aware recommendation, most of the existing algorithmic\napproaches mainly aim at solving a constrained optimization problem by imposing\na constraint on the level of fairness while optimizing the main recommendation\nobjective, e.g., CTR. While this alleviates the impact of unfair\nrecommendations, the expected return of an approach may significantly\ncompromise the recommendation accuracy due to the inherent trade-off between\nfairness and utility. This motivates us to deal with these conflicting\nobjectives and explore the optimal trade-off between them in recommendation.\nOne conspicuous approach is to seek a Pareto efficient solution to guarantee\noptimal compromises between utility and fairness. Moreover, considering the\nneeds of real-world e-commerce platforms, it would be more desirable if we can\ngeneralize the whole Pareto Frontier, so that the decision-makers can specify\nany preference of one objective over another based on their current business\nneeds. Therefore, in this work, we propose a fairness-aware recommendation\nframework using multi-objective reinforcement learning, called MoFIR, which is\nable to learn a single parametric representation for optimal recommendation\npolicies over the space of all possible preferences. Specially, we modify\ntraditional DDPG by introducing conditioned network into it, which conditions\nthe networks directly on these preferences and outputs Q-value-vectors.\nExperiments on several real-world recommendation datasets verify the\nsuperiority of our framework on both fairness metrics and recommendation\nmeasures when compared with all other baselines. We also extract the\napproximate Pareto Frontier on real-world datasets generated by MoFIR and\ncompare to state-of-the-art fairness methods.",

    "title": "Impact of Evolving Protocols and COVID-19 on Internet Traffic Shares",
    "abstract": "The rapid deployment of new Internet protocols over the last few years and\nthe COVID-19 pandemic more recently (2020) has resulted in a change in the\nInternet traffic composition. Consequently, an updated microscopic view of\ntraffic shares is needed to understand how the Internet is evolving to capture\nboth such shorter- and longer-term events. Toward this end, we observe traffic\ncomposition at a research network in Japan and a Tier-1 ISP in the USA. We\nanalyze the traffic traces passively captured at two inter-domain links: MAWI\n(Japan) and CAIDA (New York-Sao Paulo), which cover 100GB of data for MAWI\ntraces and 4TB of data for CAIDA traces in total. We begin by studying the\nimpact of COVID-19 on the MAWI link: We find a substantial increase in the\ntraffic volume of OpenVPN and rsync, as well as increases in traffic volume\nfrom cloud storage and video conferencing services, which shows that clients\nshift to remote work during the pandemic. For traffic traces between March 2018\nto December 2018, we find that the use of IPv6 is increasing quickly on the\nCAIDA monitor: The IPv6 traffic volume increases from 1.1% in March 2018 to\n6.1% in December 2018, while the IPv6 traffic share remains stable in the MAWI\ndataset at around 9% of the traffic volume. Among other protocols at the\napplication layer, 60%-70% of IPv4 traffic on the CAIDA link is HTTP(S)\ntraffic, out of which two-thirds are encrypted; for the MAWI link, more than\n90% of the traffic is Web, of which nearly 75% is encrypted. Compared to\nprevious studies, this depicts a larger increase in encrypted Web traffic of up\nto a 3-to-1 ratio of HTTPS to HTTP. As such, our observations in this study\nfurther reconfirm that traffic shares change with time and can vary greatly\ndepending on the vantage point studied despite the use of the same generalized\nmethodology and analyses, which can also be applied to other traffic monitoring\ndatasets.",

Over the\npast few years, improvements and enhancements have been brought forward and\nthey have shown some promising results in solving the complex dynamic problems,\nsystems of ordinary differential equations where the objective functions are\ncomputationally expensive to evaluate. Besides, the straightforward\nimplementation of the Bayesian Optimization algorithm performs well merely for\noptimization problems with 10-20 dimensions.

The proposed RNN-BO algorithm can solve the optimal control\nproblems in the lower dimension space and then learn from the historical data\nusing the recurrent neural network to learn the historical optimal solution\ndata and predict the optimal control strategy for any new initial system value\nsetting. In addition, accurately and quickly providing the optimal control\nstrategy is essential to effectively and efficiently control the epidemic\nspread while minimizing the associated financial costs. Therefore, to verify\nthe effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, computational experiments are\ncarried out on a deterministic SEIR epidemic model and a stochastic SIS optimal\ncontrol model.

However, when adding an imperceptible magnitude\nperturbation on the model input, the model performance might get rapid\ndecrease. To address this issue, a randomness technique has been proposed\nrecently, named Stochastic Neural Networks (SNNs).

However, existed studies on SNNs mainly focus on\ninjecting fixed or learnable noises to model weights/activations. In this\npaper, we find that the existed SNNs performances are largely bottlenecked by\nthe feature representation ability. Surprisingly, simply maximizing the\nvariance per dimension of the feature distribution leads to a considerable\nboost beyond all previous methods, which we named maximize feature distribution\nvariance stochastic neural network (MFDV-SNN).

    "abstract": "Recently, pre-trained programming language models such as CodeBERT have\ndemonstrated substantial gains in code search. Despite their success, they rely\non the availability of large amounts of parallel data to fine-tune the semantic\nmappings between queries and code. This restricts their practicality in\ndomain-specific languages with relatively scarce and expensive data. In this\npaper, we propose CDCS, a novel approach for domain-specific code search. CDCS\nemploys a transfer learning framework where an initial program representation\nmodel is pre-trained on a large corpus of common programming languages (such as\nJava and Python), and is further adapted to domain-specific languages such as\nSQL and Solidity. Unlike cross-language CodeBERT, which is directly fine-tuned\nin the target language, CDCS adapts a few-shot meta-learning algorithm called\nMAML to learn the good initialization of model parameters, which can be best\nreused in a domain-specific language. We evaluate the proposed approach on two\ndomain-specific languages, namely, SQL and Solidity, with model transferred\nfrom two widely used languages (Python and Java). Experimental results show\nthat CDCS significantly outperforms conventional pre-trained code models that\nare directly fine-tuned in domain-specific languages, and it is particularly\neffective for scarce data.",

    "abstract": "Synchronous reactive data flow is a paradigm that provides a high-level\nabstract programming model for embedded and cyber-physical systems, including\nthe locally synchronous components of IoT systems. Security in such systems is\nseverely compromised due to low-level programming, ill-defined interfaces and\ninattention to security classification of data. By incorporating a\nDenning-style lattice-based secure information flow framework into a\nsynchronous reactive data flow language, we provide a framework in which\ncorrect-and-secure-by-construction implementations for such systems may be\nspecified and derived. In particular, we propose an extension of the Lustre\nprogramming framework with a security type system. The novelty of our type\nsystem lies in a symbolic formulation of constraints over security type\nvariables, in particular the treatment of node calls, which allows us to reason\nabout secure flow with respect to any security class lattice. The main theorem\nis the soundness of our type system with respect to the co-inductive\noperational semantics of Lustre, which we prove by showing that well-typed\nprograms exhibit non-interference. Rather than tackle the full language, we\nfirst prove the non-interference result for a well-behaved sub-language called\n\"Normalised Lustre\" (NLustre), for which our type system is far simpler. We\nthen show that Bourke et al.'s semantics-preserving \"normalisation\"\ntransformations from Lustre to NLustre are security-preserving as well. This\npreservation of security types by the normalisation transformations is a\nproperty akin to \"subject reduction\" but at the level of compiler\ntransformations. The main result that well-security-typed Lustre programs are\nnon-interfering follows from a reduction to our earlier result of\nnon-interference for NLustre via the semantics-preservation (of Bourke et al.)\nand type preservation results.",

They show that a coverage-driven method is less effective than a\ngradient-based method in terms of both uncovering defects and improving model\nrobustness.\nIn this paper, we conduct a replication study of the work by Yan et al. and\nextend the experiments for deeper analysis. A larger model and a dataset of\nhigher resolution images are included to examine the generalizability of the\nresults. We also extend the experiments with more test case generation\ntechniques and adjust the process of improving model robustness to be closer to\nthe practical life cycle of DNN development. Our experiment results confirm the\nconclusion from Yan et al. that coverage-driven methods are less effective than\ngradient-based methods. Yan et al. find that using gradient-based methods to\nretrain cannot repair defects uncovered by coverage-driven methods. They\nattribute this to the fact that the two types of methods use different\nperturbation strategies: gradient-based methods perform differentiable\ntransformations while coverage-driven methods can perform additional\nnon-differentiable transformations. We test several hypotheses and further show\nthat even coverage-driven methods are constrained only to perform\ndifferentiable transformations, the uncovered defects still cannot be repaired\nby adversarial training with gradient-based methods. Thus, defensive strategies\nfor coverage-driven methods should be further studied.",

    "abstract": "Deploying various deep learning (DL) models efficiently has boosted the\nresearch on DL compilers. The difficulty of generating optimized tensor codes\ndrives DL compiler to ask for the auto-tuning approaches, and the increasing\ndemands require increasing auto-tuning efficiency and quality. Currently, the\nDL compilers partition the input DL models into several subgraphs and leverage\nthe auto-tuning to find the optimal tensor codes of these subgraphs. However,\nexisting auto-tuning approaches usually regard subgraphs as individual ones and\noverlook the similarities across them, and thus fail to exploit better tensor\ncodes under limited time budgets. We propose FamilySeer, an auto-tuning\nframework for DL compilers that can generate better tensor codes even with\nlimited time budgets. FamilySeer exploits the similarities and differences\namong subgraphs can organize them into subgraph families, where the tuning of\none subgraph can also improve other subgraphs within the same family. The cost\nmodel of each family gets more purified training samples generated by the\nfamily and becomes more accurate so that the costly measurements on real\nhardware can be replaced with the lightweight estimation through cost model.\nOur experiments show that FamilySeer can generate model codes with the same\ncode performance more efficiently than state-of-the-art auto-tuning frameworks.",

However, real-world graphs usually contain structure noises\nand have limited labeled nodes. The performance of GNNs would drop\nsignificantly when trained on such graphs, which hinders the adoption of GNNs\non many applications. Thus, it is important to develop noise-resistant GNNs\nwith limited labeled nodes. However, the work on this is rather limited.\nTherefore, we study a novel problem of developing robust GNNs on noisy graphs\nwith limited labeled nodes. Our analysis shows that both the noisy edges and\nlimited labeled nodes could harm the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. To\nmitigate these issues, we propose a novel framework which adopts the noisy\nedges as supervision to learn a denoised and dense graph, which can down-weight\nor eliminate noisy edges and facilitate message passing of GNNs to alleviate\nthe issue of limited labeled nodes. The generated edges are further used to\nregularize the predictions of unlabeled nodes with label smoothness to better\ntrain GNNs.

    "abstract": "In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, the observation space is\nspecified by human developers and restricted by physical realizations, and may\nthus be subject to dramatic changes over time (e.g. increased number of\nobservable features). However, when the observation space changes, the previous\npolicy will likely fail due to the mismatch of input features, and another\npolicy must be trained from scratch, which is inefficient in terms of\ncomputation and sample complexity. Following theoretical insights, we propose a\nnovel algorithm which extracts the latent-space dynamics in the source task,\nand transfers the dynamics model to the target task to use as a model-based\nregularizer. Our algorithm works for drastic changes of observation space (e.g.\nfrom vector-based observation to image-based observation), without any\ninter-task mapping or any prior knowledge of the target task. Empirical results\nshow that our algorithm significantly improves the efficiency and stability of\nlearning in the target task.",

We find that the complex phasor of the tag current is constrained\nto a disk and that the capacity problem can therefore be described with\nexisting results on peak-power-limited quadrature channels. This allows us to\nstate the channel capacity and the capacity-achieving distribution of the load\nimpedance, which is described by non-concentric circles in the right\nhalf-plane. For the low-SNR case (SNR < 4.8 dB) we find that channel capacity\nis achieved by a purely reactive load with Cauchy-distributed reactance. The\nexposition is based on a system model that abstracts all relevant classes of\nbackscatter communication systems, including RFID. To address practicality, we\nconstruct a symbol alphabet that allows for a near-capacity information rate of\nmore than 6 bit per load-switching period at reasonably high SNR. We also find\nthat the rate hardly decreases when typical value-range constraints are imposed\non the load impedance.",

Effective diversification strategies depend on quantifying the\ncorrelates, causes, and trends of diversity in the field. But field-level\ndemographic changes are driven by subfield hiring dynamics because faculty\nsearches are typically at the subfield level. Here, we quantify and forecast\nvariations in the demographic composition of the subfields of computing using a\ncomprehensive database of training and employment records for 6882 tenure-track\nfaculty from 269 PhD-granting computing departments in the United States,\nlinked with 327,969 publications. We find that subfield prestige correlates\nwith gender inequality, such that faculty working in computing subfields with\nmore women tend to hold positions at less prestigious institutions. In\ncontrast, we find no significant evidence of racial or socioeconomic\ndifferences by subfield. Tracking representation over time, we find steady\nprogress toward gender equality in all subfields, but more prestigious\nsubfields tend to be roughly 25 years behind the less prestigious subfields in\ngender representation. These results illustrate how the choice of subfield in a\nfaculty search can shape a department's gender diversity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Numerical integration on spheres, including the computation of the\nareas of spherical triangles, is a core computation in geomathematics. The\ncommonly used techniques sometimes suffer from instabilities and significant\nloss of accuracy. We describe a new algorithm, called ARPIST, for accurate and\nstable integration of functions on spherical triangles. ARPIST is based on an\neasy-to-implement transformation to the spherical triangle from its\ncorresponding linear triangle via radial projection to achieve high accuracy\nand efficiency. More importantly, ARPIST overcomes potential instabilities in\ncomputing the Jacobian of the transformation, even for poorly shaped triangles\nthat may occur at poles in regular longitude-latitude meshes, by avoiding\npotential catastrophic rounding errors. We compare our proposed technique with\nL'Huilier's Theorem for computing the area of spherical triangles, and also\ncompare it with the recently developed LSQST method (J. Beckmann, H.N. Mhaskar,\nand J. Prestin, GEM - Int. J. Geomath., 5:143-162, 2014) and a\nradial-basis-function-based technique (J. A. Reeger and B. Fornberg, Stud.\nAppl.

    "abstract": "In solution verification, the primary goal is finding an accurate and\nreliable estimate of the discretization error. A commonly used approach,\nhowever, has potential problems due to the use of the observed order of\naccuracy. Therefore, we propose a grid refinement method called the Preset\nOrders Expansion Method (POEM) which employs constant orders given by the user.\nWith the scheme outlined in this paper, the user is guaranteed to obtain the\noptimal set of orders through iterations and subsequently an accurate estimate\nof the discretization error. Regarding the reliability of the estimation, the\nproposed method targets on the asymptotic convergence of numerical solutions,\nwhich is fundamental to all grid refinement methods. The above capabilities are\ndemonstrated with problems in which multiple dimensions are refined. Moreover,\nPOEM can be applied with using a fractional refinement ratio greater than 0.5.\nAlthough this can lower the computational demand, the estimated error will\nbecome more uncertain due to the reduction in the number of shared grid points.\nWe circumvent this with the Method of Interpolating Differences between\nApproximate Solutions (MIDAS) which introduces additional shared grid points\nduring refinement. As a result, the proposed grid refinement method is lifted\nto a practical level.",

    "abstract": "Given the success of IoT platforms, more developers and companies want to\ninclude the technology in their portfolio. However, in the case of single board\nmicrocontrollers, the support for networking operations is not ideal, and\ndifferent IoT platforms allow access to the networking submodule via different\nlibraries and system calls, leading to a steeper learning curve. Code\ngenerators for API clients can enhance productivity, but they tend to generate\nuniversal purpose code, and on the other hand the networking primitives of IoT\ndevices are platform specific, especially when security mechanisms such as\nTransport Layer Security are part of the picture. This paper presents\n\\texttt{cpp-tiny-client}, an API client generator developed as a plugin for the\nOpenAPI Generator project, which can tailor the generated code based on the IoT\nplatform specified by the user. Our work allows to generate correct code for\nAPI clients for IoT devices, and thus can empower a developer with more\nproductivity and a faster time-to-market for its own applications. By combining\ntogether mainstream technologies only, \\texttt{cpp-tiny-client} offers a gentle\nlearning curve. Moreover, experiments show that the generated code has a\nreasonable footprint, at least with respect to the IoT devices that were used\nin the validation of the work.

We call these \"grey-box\" BO methods because they treat objective\ncomputation as partially observable and even modifiable, blending the black-box\napproach with so-called \"white-box\" first-principles knowledge of objective\nfunction computation. This tutorial describes these methods, focusing on BO of\ncomposite objective functions, where one can observe and selectively evaluate\nindividual constituents that feed into the overall objective; and\nmulti-fidelity BO, where one can evaluate cheaper approximations of the\nobjective function by varying parameters of the evaluation oracle.",

Given any query nodes, CS\naims to find cohesive subgraphs that query nodes belong to. Recently, a large\nnumber of CS algorithms are designed. These algorithms adopt pre-defined\nsubgraph patterns to model the communities, which cannot find communities that\ndo not have such pre-defined patterns in real-world graphs. Thereby, machine\nlearning based approaches are proposed to capture flexible community structures\nby learning from community ground-truth in a data-driven fashion. However,\nexisting approaches rely on sufficient training data to provide enough\ngeneralization for machine learning models. In this paper, we study ML-based\napproaches for community search, under the circumstance that the training data\nis scarce. To learn from small data, we extract prior knowledge which is shared\nacross different graphs as CS tasks in advance. Subsequent small training data\nfrom a new CS task are combined with the learned prior knowledge to help the\nmodel well adapt to that specific task. A novel meta-learning based framework,\ncalled CGNP, is designed and implemented to fulfill this learning procedure. A\nmeta CGNP model is a task-common node embedding function for clustering by\nnature, learned by metric-based learning. To the best of our knowledge, CGNP is\nthe first meta model solution for CS. We compare CGNP with traditional CS\nalgorithms, e.g., CTC, ATC, ACQ, and ML baselines on real graph datasets with\nground-truth.

    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms typically assume that training and test examples\nare drawn from the same distribution. However, distribution shift is a common\nproblem in real-world applications and can cause models to perform dramatically\nworse at test time. In this paper, we specifically consider the problems of\ndomain shifts and subpopulation shifts (eg. imbalanced data). While prior works\noften seek to explicitly regularize internal representations and predictors of\nthe model to be domain invariant, we instead aim to regularize the whole\nfunction without restricting the model's internal representations. This leads\nto a simple mixup-based technique which learns invariant functions via\nselective augmentation called LISA. LISA selectively interpolates samples\neither with the same labels but different domains or with the same domain but\ndifferent labels. We analyze a linear setting and theoretically show how LISA\nleads to a smaller worst-group error. Empirically, we study the effectiveness\nof LISA on nine benchmarks ranging from subpopulation shifts to domain shifts,\nand we find that LISA consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

Although many\nsoftware based interventions exist to reduce screentime, users report a variety\nof issues relating to the timing of the intervention, the strictness of the\ntool, and its ability to encourage organic, long-term habit formation. We\ndevelop guidelines for the design of behaviour intervention software by\nconducting a survey to investigate three research questions and further inform\nthe mechanisms of computer-related behaviour change applications.

Previous attempts at entity alignment have explored different\nKG structures, such as neighborhood-based and path-based contexts, to learn\nentity embeddings, but they are limited in capturing the multi-context\nfeatures. Moreover, most approaches directly utilize the embedding similarity\nto determine entity alignment without considering the global interaction among\nentities and relations. In this work, we propose an Informed Multi-context\nEntity Alignment (IMEA) model to address these issues. In particular, we\nintroduce Transformer to flexibly capture the relation, path, and neighborhood\ncontexts, and design holistic reasoning to estimate alignment probabilities\nbased on both embedding similarity and the relation/entity functionality. The\nalignment evidence obtained from holistic reasoning is further injected back\ninto the Transformer via the proposed soft label editing to inform embedding\nlearning.

Expensive operators such as feature extractors and\nclassifiers are deployed as user-defined functions(UDFs), which are not\npenetrable with classic query optimization techniques such as predicate\npush-down.

While these models have been heavily\ncriticized for their black-box nature, their robustness to slight perturbations\nin input text has been a matter of concern. In this work, we carry out a\ndata-focused study evaluating the impact of systematic practical perturbations\non the performance of the deep learning based text classification models like\nCNN, LSTM, and BERT-based algorithms. The perturbations are induced by the\naddition and removal of unwanted tokens like punctuation and stop-words that\nare minimally associated with the final performance of the model. We show that\nthese deep learning approaches including BERT are sensitive to such legitimate\ninput perturbations on four standard benchmark datasets SST2, TREC-6, BBC News,\nand tweet_eval. We observe that BERT is more susceptible to the removal of\ntokens as compared to the addition of tokens. Moreover, LSTM is slightly more\nsensitive to input perturbations as compared to CNN based model.

Despite delivering encouraging results,\nthese approaches are all convolution-based, and are naturally weak in global\nrelation modeling of sub-aperture images necessarily to characterize the\ninherent structure of light fields. In this paper, we put forth a novel\nformulation built upon Transformers, by treating LFSR as a sequence-to-sequence\nreconstruction task. In particular, our model regards sub-aperture images of\neach vertical or horizontal angular view as a sequence, and establishes\nlong-range geometric dependencies within each sequence via a spatial-angular\nlocally-enhanced self-attention layer, which maintains the locality of each\nsub-aperture image as well. Additionally, to better recover image details, we\npropose a detail-preserving Transformer (termed as DPT), by leveraging gradient\nmaps of light field to guide the sequence learning. DPT consists of two\nbranches, with each associated with a Transformer for learning from an original\nor gradient image sequence. The two branches are finally fused to obtain\ncomprehensive feature representations for reconstruction.

However, existing\nmethods fail to meet essential requirements for event graphs, such as (i)\ndealing with semi-supervised graph embedding to take advantage of some labeled\nevents, (ii) automatically determining the importance of the relationships\nbetween event vertices and their metadata vertices, as well as (iii) dealing\nwith the graph heterogeneity. This paper presents GNEE (GAT Neural Event\nEmbeddings), a method that combines Graph Attention Networks and Graph\nRegularization. First, an event graph regularization is proposed to ensure that\nall graph vertices receive event features, thereby mitigating the graph\nheterogeneity drawback. Second, semi-supervised graph embedding with\nself-attention mechanism considers existing labeled events, as well as learns\nthe importance of relationships in the event graph during the representation\nlearning process. A statistical analysis of experimental results with five\nreal-world event graphs and six graph embedding methods shows that our GNEE\noutperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised graph embedding methods.",

    "abstract": "Outlier detection refers to the identification of data points that deviate\nfrom a general data distribution. Existing unsupervised approaches often suffer\nfrom high computational cost, complex hyperparameter tuning, and limited\ninterpretability, especially when working with large, high-dimensional\ndatasets. To address these issues, we present a simple yet effective algorithm\ncalled ECOD (Empirical-Cumulative-distribution-based Outlier Detection), which\nis inspired by the fact that outliers are often the \"rare events\" that appear\nin the tails of a distribution. In a nutshell, ECOD first estimates the\nunderlying distribution of the input data in a nonparametric fashion by\ncomputing the empirical cumulative distribution per dimension of the data. ECOD\nthen uses these empirical distributions to estimate tail probabilities per\ndimension for each data point. Finally, ECOD computes an outlier score of each\ndata point by aggregating estimated tail probabilities across dimensions. Our\ncontributions are as follows: (1) we propose a novel outlier detection method\ncalled ECOD, which is both parameter-free and easy to interpret; (2) we perform\nextensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets, where we find that ECOD\noutperforms 11 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and\nscalability; and (3) we release an easy-to-use and scalable (with distributed\nsupport) Python implementation for accessibility and reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Many image processing networks apply a single set of static convolutional\nkernels across the entire input image, which is sub-optimal for natural images,\nas they often consist of heterogeneous visual patterns. Recent work in\nclassification, segmentation, and image restoration has demonstrated that\ndynamic kernels outperform static kernels at modeling local image statistics.\nHowever, these works often adopt per-pixel convolution kernels, which introduce\nhigh memory and computation costs. To achieve spatial-varying processing\nwithout significant overhead, we present \\textbf{Malle}able\n\\textbf{Conv}olution (\\textbf{MalleConv}), as an efficient variant of dynamic\nconvolution. The weights of \\ours are dynamically produced by an efficient\npredictor network capable of generating content-dependent outputs at specific\nspatial locations. Unlike previous works, \\ours generates a much smaller set of\nspatially-varying kernels from input, which enlarges the network's receptive\nfield and significantly reduces computational and memory costs. These kernels\nare then applied to a full-resolution feature map through an efficient\nslice-and-conv operator with minimum memory overhead. We further build a\nefficient denoising network using MalleConv, coined as \\textbf{MalleNet}. It\nachieves high quality results without very deep architecture, \\eg, it is\n8.91$\\times$ faster than the best performed denoising algorithms (SwinIR),\nwhile maintaining similar performance. We also show that a single \\ours added\nto a standard convolution-based backbones can contribute significantly reduce\nthe computational cost or boost image quality at similar cost.

Despite this\nsuccess, biological organisms still hold one large advantage over these\nsimulated agents: adaptation. While both living and simulated agents make\ndecisions to achieve goals (strategy), biological organisms have evolved to\nunderstand their environment (sensing) and respond to it (physiology). The net\ngain of these factors depends on the environment, and organisms have adapted\naccordingly. For example, in a low vision aquatic environment some fish have\nevolved specific neurons which offer a predictable, but incredibly rapid,\nstrategy to escape from predators. Mammals have lost these reactive systems,\nbut they have a much larger fields of view and brain circuitry capable of\nunderstanding many future possibilities.

This\nsystematic review analyzes 240 works published in scholarly journals between\n2000 and 2019 that focus on applying Artificial Intelligence (AI), statistical,\nand hybrid models to short-term load forecasting (STLF). This work represents\nthe most comprehensive review of works on this subject to date.

The review demonstrates that it is commonly possible with\nthese hybrid combinations to achieve prediction accuracy exceeding 99%.

    "abstract": "The effortless detection of salient objects by humans has been the subject of\nresearch in several fields, including computer vision as it has many\napplications. However, salient object detection remains a challenge for many\ncomputer models dealing with color and textured images. Herein, we propose a\nnovel and efficient strategy, through a simple model, almost without internal\nparameters, which generates a robust saliency map for a natural image. This\nstrategy consists of integrating color information into local textural patterns\nto characterize a color micro-texture. Most models in the literature that use\nthe color and texture features treat them separately. In our case, it is the\nsimple, yet powerful LTP (Local Ternary Patterns) texture descriptor applied to\nopposing color pairs of a color space that allows us to achieve this end. Each\ncolor micro-texture is represented by vector whose components are from a\nsuperpixel obtained by SLICO (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering with zero\nparameter) algorithm which is simple, fast and exhibits state-of-the-art\nboundary adherence. The degree of dissimilarity between each pair of color\nmicro-texture is computed by the FastMap method, a fast version of MDS\n(Multi-dimensional Scaling), that considers the color micro-textures\nnon-linearity while preserving their distances. These degrees of dissimilarity\ngive us an intermediate saliency map for each RGB, HSL, LUV and CMY color\nspaces. The final saliency map is their combination to take advantage of the\nstrength of each of them. The MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and F$_{\\beta}$\nmeasures of our saliency maps, on the complex ECSSD dataset show that our model\nis both simple and efficient, outperforming several state-of-the-art models.",

Although the existing methods train well-designed deep networks\nwith a large amount of data, we find that they can easily forget the rarely\nappeared cases in the training stage due to the off-balance data distribution,\nwhich influences the model generalization and leads to undesirable performance.\nTo tackle this issue, we propose a memory-augmented network, called\nMemory-Guided Semantic Learning Network (MGSL-Net), that learns and memorizes\nthe rarely appeared content in TSG tasks. Specifically, MGSL-Net consists of\nthree main parts: a cross-modal inter-action module, a memory augmentation\nmodule, and a heterogeneous attention module. We first align the given\nvideo-query pair by a cross-modal graph convolutional network, and then utilize\na memory module to record the cross-modal shared semantic features in the\ndomain-specific persistent memory. During training, the memory slots are\ndynamically associated with both common and rare cases, alleviating the\nforgetting issue. In testing, the rare cases can thus be enhanced by retrieving\nthe stored memories, resulting in better generalization. At last, the\nheterogeneous attention module is utilized to integrate the enhanced\nmulti-modal features in both video and query domains. Experimental results on\nthree benchmarks show the superiority of our method on both effectiveness and\nefficiency, which substantially improves the accuracy not only on the entire\ndataset but also on rare cases.",

A major limitation of these works is that they fail to\ndistinguish ambiguous video frames with subtle appearance differences due to\nframe-level feature extraction. Recently, a few methods adopt Faster R-CNN to\nextract detailed object features in each frame to differentiate the\nfine-grained appearance similarities. However, the object-level features\nextracted by Faster R-CNN suffer from missing motion analysis since the object\ndetection model lacks temporal modeling. To solve this issue, we propose a\nnovel Motion-Appearance Reasoning Network (MARN), which incorporates both\nmotion-aware and appearance-aware object features to better reason object\nrelations for modeling the activity among successive frames. Specifically, we\nfirst introduce two individual video encoders to embed the video into\ncorresponding motion-oriented and appearance-aspect object representations.\nThen, we develop separate motion and appearance branches to learn motion-guided\nand appearance-guided object relations, respectively. At last, both motion and\nappearance information from two branches are associated to generate more\nrepresentative features for final grounding. Extensive experiments on two\nchallenging datasets (Charades-STA and TACoS) show that our proposed MARN\nsignificantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is a challenging task to\nlocalize the object by only category labels. However, there is contradiction\nbetween classification and localization because accurate classification network\ntends to pay attention to discriminative region of objects rather than the\nentirety. We propose this discrimination is caused by handcraft threshold\nchoosing in CAM-based methods. Therefore, we propose Clustering and Filter of\nTokens (CaFT) with Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone to solve this problem in\nanother way. CaFT first sends the patch tokens of the image split to ViT and\ncluster the output tokens to generate initial mask of the object. Secondly,\nCaFT considers the initial mask as pseudo labels to train a shallow convolution\nhead (Attention Filter, AtF) following backbone to directly extract the mask\nfrom tokens. Then, CaFT splits the image into parts, outputs masks respectively\nand merges them into one refined mask. Finally, a new AtF is trained on the\nrefined masks and used to predict the box of object. Experiments verify that\nCaFT outperforms previous work and achieves 97.55\\% and 69.86\\% localization\naccuracy with ground-truth class on CUB-200 and ImageNet-1K respectively. CaFT\nprovides a fresh way to think about the WSOL task.",

While out-of-order (OoO) cores, and\ntechniques building on them, are effective at exploiting MLP, they deliver poor\nenergy efficiency due to their complex and energy-hungry hardware. This work\nrevisits slice-out-of-order (sOoO) cores as an energy efficient alternative for\nMLP exploitation. sOoO cores achieve energy efficiency by constructing and\nexecuting \\textit{slices} of MLP generating instructions out-of-order only with\nrespect to the rest of instructions; the slices and the remaining instructions,\nby themselves, execute in-order. However, we observe that existing sOoO cores\nmiss significant MLP opportunities due to their dependence-oblivious in-order\nslice execution, which causes dependent slices to frequently block MLP\ngeneration. To boost MLP generation, we introduce Freeway, a sOoO core based on\na new dependence-aware slice execution policy that tracks dependent slices and\nkeeps them from blocking subsequent independent slices and MLP extraction. The\nproposed core incurs minimal area and power overheads, yet approaches the MLP\nbenefits of fully OoO cores.

    "abstract": "Many past attempts at modeling repeated Cournot games assume that demand is\nstationary. This does not align with real-world scenarios in which market\ndemands can evolve over a product's lifetime for a myriad of reasons. In this\npaper, we model repeated Cournot games with non-stationary demand such that\nfirms/agents face separate instances of non-stationary multi-armed bandit\nproblem. The set of arms/actions that an agent can choose from represents\ndiscrete production quantities; here, the action space is ordered. Agents are\nindependent and autonomous, and cannot observe anything from the environment;\nthey can only see their own rewards after taking an action, and only work\ntowards maximizing these rewards. We propose a novel algorithm 'Adaptive with\nWeighted Exploration (AWE) $\\epsilon$-greedy' which is remotely based on the\nwell-known $\\epsilon$-greedy approach. This algorithm detects and quantifies\nchanges in rewards due to varying market demand and varies learning rate and\nexploration rate in proportion to the degree of changes in demand, thus\nenabling agents to better identify new optimal actions. For efficient\nexploration, it also deploys a mechanism for weighing actions that takes\nadvantage of the ordered action space. We use simulations to study the\nemergence of various equilibria in the market. In addition, we study the\nscalability of our approach in terms number of total agents in the system and\nthe size of action space. We consider both symmetric and asymmetric firms in\nour models. We found that using our proposed method, agents are able to swiftly\nchange their course of action according to the changes in demand, and they also\nengage in collusive behavior in many simulations.",

In this work, we propose a simple and unified framework built\nupon Transformer, termed ReferFormer. It views the language as queries and\ndirectly attends to the most relevant regions in the video frames. Concretely,\nwe introduce a small set of object queries conditioned on the language as the\ninput to the Transformer. In this manner, all the queries are obligated to find\nthe referred objects only. They are eventually transformed into dynamic kernels\nwhich capture the crucial object-level information, and play the role of\nconvolution filters to generate the segmentation masks from feature maps. The\nobject tracking is achieved naturally by linking the corresponding queries\nacross frames. This mechanism greatly simplifies the pipeline and the\nend-to-end framework is significantly different from the previous methods.\nExtensive experiments on Ref-Youtube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences and\nJHMDB-Sentences show the effectiveness of ReferFormer. On Ref-Youtube-VOS,\nRefer-Former achieves 55.6J&F with a ResNet-50 backbone without bells and\nwhistles, which exceeds the previous state-of-the-art performance by 8.4\npoints. In addition, with the strong Swin-Large backbone, ReferFormer achieves\nthe best J&F of 62.4 among all existing methods.

Moreover, we show\nthe impressive results of 55.0 mAP and 43.7 mAP on A2D-Sentences\nandJHMDB-Sentences respectively, which significantly outperforms the previous\nmethods by a large margin.

In addition, we show that MPNNs can be viewed\nas special cases of KerGNNs. We apply KerGNNs to multiple graph-related tasks\nand use cross-validation to make fair comparisons with benchmarks.

    "title": "Benchmark Functions for CEC 2022 Competition on Seeking Multiple Optima  in Dynamic Environments",
    "abstract": "Dynamic and multimodal features are two important properties and widely\nexisted in many real-world optimization problems. The former illustrates that\nthe objectives and/or constraints of the problems change over time, while the\nlatter means there is more than one optimal solution (sometimes including the\naccepted local solutions) in each environment. The dynamic multimodal\noptimization problems (DMMOPs) have both of these characteristics, which have\nbeen studied in the field of evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence\nfor years, and attract more and more attention. Solving such problems requires\noptimization algorithms to simultaneously track multiple optima in the changing\nenvironments. So that the decision makers can pick out one optimal solution in\neach environment according to their experiences and preferences, or quickly\nturn to other solutions when the current one cannot work well. This is very\nhelpful for the decision makers, especially when facing changing environments.\nIn this competition, a test suit about DMMOPs is given, which models the\nreal-world applications. Specifically, this test suit adopts 8 multimodal\nfunctions and 8 change modes to construct 24 typical dynamic multimodal\noptimization problems. Meanwhile, the metric is also given to measure the\nalgorithm performance, which considers the average number of optimal solutions\nfound in all environments. This competition will be very helpful to promote the\ndevelopment of dynamic multimodal optimization algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has led to their\napplication in several domains. One noteworthy application is the perception\nsystem for autonomous driving that relies on the predictions from CNNs.\nPractitioners evaluate the generalization ability of such CNNs by calculating\nvarious metrics on an independent test dataset. A test dataset is often chosen\nbased on only one precondition, i.e., its elements are not a part of the\ntraining data. Such a dataset may contain objects that are both similar and\nnovel w.r.t. the training dataset. Nevertheless, existing works do not reckon\nthe novelty of the test samples and treat them all equally for evaluating\ngeneralization. Such novelty-based evaluations are of significance to validate\nthe fitness of a CNN in autonomous driving applications. Hence, we propose a\nCNN generalization scoring framework that considers novelty of objects in the\ntest dataset. We begin with the representation learning technique to reduce the\nimage data into a low-dimensional space. It is on this space we estimate the\nnovelty of the test samples. Finally, we calculate the generalization score as\na combination of the test data prediction performance and novelty. We perform\nan experimental study of the same for our traffic light detection application.\nIn addition, we systematically visualize the results for an interpretable\nnotion of novelty.",

Knowing the Technology readiness\nlevel (TRL) of a given target technology proved to be useful to mitigate risks\nsuch as cost overrun, product roll out delays, or early launch failures.\nOriginally developed for space programmes by NASA, TRL became a de facto\nstandard among technology and manufacturing companies and even among research\nfunding agencies. However, while TRL assessments provide a systematic\nevaluation process resulting in meaningful metric, they are one dimensional:\nthey only answer the question if a technology can go into production. Hence\nthey leave an inherent gap, i.e., if a technology fulfils requirements with a\ncertain quality. This gap becomes intolerable when this metric is applied\nsoftware such as technological cybersecurity measures. With legislation such as\nthe General Data Protection Regulation4 (GDPR) and the Network and Information\nSystems Directive5 (NIS-D) making reference to state of the art when requiring\nappropriate protection measures, software designers are faced with the question\nhow to measure if a technology is suitable to use.

However, many studies have shown that HAS suffers from many Quality\nof Experience (QoE)-related issues in the presence of competing players. This\nis mainly caused by the selfishness of the players resulting from the\ndecentralized intelligence given to the player. Another limitation is the\nbottleneck link that could happen at any time during the streaming session and\nanywhere in the network. These issues may result in wobbling bandwidth\nperception by the players and could lead to missing the deadline for chunk\ndownloads, which result in the most annoying issue consisting of rebuffering\nevents. In this paper, we leverage the SoftwareDefined Networking paradigm to\ntake advantage of the global view of the network and its powerful intelligence\nthat allows reacting to the network changing conditions. Ultimately, we aim at\npreventing the re-buffering events, resulting from deadline misses, and\nensuring high QoE for the accepted clients in the system. To this end, we use\nDeterministic Network Calculus (DNC) to guarantee a maximum delay for the\ndownload of the video chunks while maximizing the perceived video quality.\nSimulation results show that the proposed solution ensures high efficiency for\nthe accepted clients without any rebuffering events which result in high user\nQoE.

    "abstract": "Along with the increasing demand for latencysensitive services and\napplications, Deterministic Network (DetNet) concept has been recently proposed\nto investigate deterministic latency assurance for services featured with\nbounded latency requirements in 5G edge networks. The Network Function\nVirtualization (NFV) technology enables Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to\nflexibly place Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) achieving performance and cost\nbenefits. Then, Service Function Chains (SFC) are formed by steering traffic\nthrough a series of VNF instances in a predefined order. Moreover, the required\nnetwork resources and placement of VNF instances along SFC should be optimized\nto meet the deterministic latency requirements. Therefore, it is significant\nfor ISPs to determine an optimal SFC deployment strategy to ensure network\nperformance while improving the network revenue. In this paper, we jointly\ninvestigate the resource allocation and SFC placement in 5G edge networks for\ndeterministic latency assurance. We formulate this problem as a mathematic\nprogramming model with the objective of maximizing the overall network profit\nfor ISP. Furthermore, a novel Deterministic SFC deployment (Det-SFCD) algorithm\nis proposed to efficiently embed SFC requests with deterministic latency\nassurance. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm\ncan provide better performance in terms of SFC request acceptance rate, network\ncost reduction, and network resource efficiency compared with benchmark\nstrategy.",

To enable such zero-shot cost models, we suggest a new\nlearning paradigm based on pre-trained cost models. As core contributions to\nsupport the transfer of such a pre-trained cost model to unseen databases, we\nintroduce a new model architecture and representation technique for encoding\nquery workloads as input to those models. As we will show in our evaluation,\nzero-shot cost estimation can provide more accurate cost estimates than\nstate-of-the-art models for a wide range of (real-world) databases without\nrequiring any query executions on unseen databases. Furthermore, we show that\nzero-shot cost models can be used in a few-shot mode that further improves\ntheir quality by retraining them just with a small number of additional\ntraining queries on the unseen database.",

The stability of this algorithm has\nbeen verified and performance-proofed in both the exploration and exploitation\nstages using some standard measurements. This influenced our target to gauge\nthe performance of the algorithm in training multilayer perceptron neural\nnetworks (MLP).

However, recent KGE models suffer from high training cost and large\nstorage space, thus limiting their practicality in real-world applications. To\naddress this challenge, based on the latest findings in the field of\nContrastive Learning, we propose a novel KGE training framework called\nHardness-aware Low-dimensional Embedding (HaLE). Instead of the traditional\nNegative Sampling, we design a new loss function based on query sampling that\ncan balance two important training targets, Alignment and Uniformity.\nFurthermore, we analyze the hardness-aware ability of recent low-dimensional\nhyperbolic models and propose a lightweight hardness-aware activation\nmechanism, which can help the KGE models focus on hard instances and speed up\nconvergence. The experimental results show that in the limited training time,\nHaLE can effectively improve the performance and training speed of KGE models\non five commonly-used datasets.

For every agent, DDPG\ntrains a local actor (policy) and a local critic (Q-function). The analysis\nshows that multi-agent DDPG using neural networks to approximate the local\npolicies and critics converge to limits with the following properties: The\ncritic limits minimize the average squared Bellman loss; the actor limits\nparameterize a policy that maximizes the local critic's approximation of\n$Q_i^*$, where $i$ is the agent index.

This is performed in a tightly coupled fashion using a\nDynamic Network approach that results in an optimally compensated trajectory\nthrough modeling of errors at the sensor, rather than the trajectory, level.\nThe 3D correspondences are formulated as static conditions within this network\nand the registered point cloud is generated with higher accuracy utilizing the\ncorrected trajectory and possibly other parameters determined within the\nadjustment.

    "title": "Toxicity Detection for Indic Multilingual Social Media Content",
    "abstract": "Toxic content is one of the most critical issues for social media platforms\ntoday. India alone had 518 million social media users in 2020. In order to\nprovide a good experience to content creators and their audience, it is crucial\nto flag toxic comments and the users who post that. But the big challenge is\nidentifying toxicity in low resource Indic languages because of the presence of\nmultiple representations of the same text. Moreover, the posts/comments on\nsocial media do not adhere to a particular format, grammar or sentence\nstructure; this makes the task of abuse detection even more challenging for\nmultilingual social media platforms. This paper describes the system proposed\nby team 'Moj Masti' using the data provided by ShareChat/Moj in \\emph{IIIT-D\nMultilingual Abusive Comment Identification} challenge. We focus on how we can\nleverage multilingual transformer based pre-trained and fine-tuned models to\napproach code-mixed/code-switched classification tasks. Our best performing\nsystem was an ensemble of XLM-RoBERTa and MuRIL which achieved a Mean F-1 score\nof 0.9 on the test data/leaderboard. We also observed an increase in the\nperformance by adding transliterated data. Furthermore, using weak metadata,\nensembling and some post-processing techniques boosted the performance of our\nsystem, thereby placing us 1st on the leaderboard.",

    "abstract": "Most semi-supervised learning methods over-sample labeled data when\nconstructing training mini-batches. This paper studies whether this common\npractice improves learning and how. We compare it to an alternative setting\nwhere each mini-batch is uniformly sampled from all the training data, labeled\nor not, which greatly reduces direct supervision from true labels in typical\nlow-label regimes. However, this simpler setting can also be seen as more\ngeneral and even necessary in multi-task problems where over-sampling labeled\ndata would become intractable. Our experiments on semi-supervised CIFAR-10\nimage classification using FixMatch show a performance drop when using the\nuniform sampling approach which diminishes when the amount of labeled data or\nthe training time increases. Further, we analyse the training dynamics to\nunderstand how over-sampling of labeled data compares to uniform sampling. Our\nmain finding is that over-sampling is especially beneficial early in training\nbut gets less important in the later stages when more pseudo-labels become\ncorrect. Nevertheless, we also find that keeping some true labels remains\nimportant to avoid the accumulation of confirmation errors from incorrect\npseudo-labels.",

Experimental results using a discrete\nSierpinski Triangle as a case study shows up to $\\sim12\\times$ of speedup and a\nmemory reduction factor of up to $\\sim 315\\times$ with respect to a GPU-based\nexpanded-space bounding box approach.

This type of training problems has recently gained\npopularity since semidefinite constraints can be used to verify interesting\nproperties for NNs that include, e.g., the estimation of an upper bound on the\nLipschitz constant, which relates to the robustness of an NN, or the stability\nof dynamic systems with NN controllers. The utilized semidefinite constraints\nare based on sector constraints satisfied by the underlying activation\nfunctions. Unfortunately, one of the biggest bottlenecks of these new results\nis the required computational effort for incorporating the semidefinite\nconstraints into the training of NNs which is limiting their scalability to\nlarge NNs. We address this challenge by developing interior point methods for\nNN training that we implement using barrier functions for semidefinite\nconstraints. In order to efficiently compute the gradients of the barrier\nterms, we exploit the structure of the semidefinite constraints. In\nexperiments, we demonstrate the superior efficiency of our training method over\nprevious approaches, which allows us, e.g., to use semidefinite constraints in\nthe training of Wasserstein generative adversarial networks, where the\ndiscriminator must satisfy a Lipschitz condition.",

    "abstract": "The widely applied density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm makes an intuitive\ncluster formation assumption that cluster centers are often surrounded by data\npoints with lower local density and far away from other data points with higher\nlocal density. However, this assumption suffers from one limitation that it is\noften problematic when identifying clusters with lower density because they\nmight be easily merged into other clusters with higher density. As a result,\nDPC may not be able to identify clusters with variational density. To address\nthis issue, we propose a variational density peak clustering (VDPC) algorithm,\nwhich is designed to systematically and autonomously perform the clustering\ntask on datasets with various types of density distributions. Specifically, we\nfirst propose a novel method to identify the representatives among all data\npoints and construct initial clusters based on the identified representatives\nfor further analysis of the clusters' property. Furthermore, we divide all data\npoints into different levels according to their local density and propose a\nunified clustering framework by combining the advantages of both DPC and\nDBSCAN. Thus, all the identified initial clusters spreading across different\ndensity levels are systematically processed to form the final clusters. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of the proposed VDPC algorithm, we conduct extensive\nexperiments using 20 datasets including eight synthetic, six real-world and six\nimage datasets. The experimental results show that VDPC outperforms two\nclassical algorithms (i.e., DPC and DBSCAN) and four state-of-the-art extended\nDPC algorithms.",

We propose a novel systematic approach to\nsolve PSMM and FPMM with colluding workers, which leverages solutions to a\nrelated Secure Matrix Multiplication (SMM) problem where the data (rather than\nthe indices) of the multiplied matrices are kept private from colluding\nworkers. Specifically, given an SMM strategy based on polynomial codes or\nLagrange codes, one can exploit the special structure inspired by the matrix\nencoding function to design private coded queries for PSMM/FPMM, such that the\nalgebraic structure of the computation result at each worker resembles that of\nthe underlying SMM strategy. Adopting this systematic approach provides novel\ninsights in private query designs for private matrix multiplication,\nsubstantially simplifying the processes of designing PSMM and FPMM strategies.\nFurthermore, the PSMM and FPMM strategies constructed following the proposed\napproach outperform the state-of-the-art strategies in one or more performance\nmetrics including recovery threshold (minimal number of workers the master\nneeds to wait for before correctly recovering the multiplication result),\ncommunication cost, and computation complexity, demonstrating a more flexible\ntradeoff in optimizing system efficiency.",

In this article, we develop a framework for\nverifying partially-observable, discrete-time dynamical systems with unmodelled\ndynamics against temporal logic specifications from a given input-output\ndataset. The verification framework employs Gaussian process (GP) regression to\nlearn the unknown dynamics from the dataset and abstract the continuous-space\nsystem as a finite-state, uncertain Markov decision process (MDP). This\nabstraction relies on space discretization and transition probability intervals\nthat capture the uncertainty due to the error in GP regression by using\nreproducible kernel Hilbert space analysis as well as the uncertainty induced\nby discretization. The framework utilizes existing model checking tools for\nverification of the uncertain MDP abstraction against a given temporal logic\nspecification. We establish the correctness of extending the verification\nresults on the abstraction to the underlying partially-observable system. We\nshow that the computational complexity of the framework is polynomial in the\nsize of the dataset and discrete abstraction. The complexity analysis\nillustrates a trade-off between the quality of the verification results and the\ncomputational burden to handle larger datasets and finer abstractions.

    "title": "Compression-Resistant Backdoor Attack against Deep Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "In recent years, many backdoor attacks based on training data poisoning have\nbeen proposed. However, in practice, those backdoor attacks are vulnerable to\nimage compressions. When backdoor instances are compressed, the feature of\nspecific backdoor trigger will be destroyed, which could result in the backdoor\nattack performance deteriorating. In this paper, we propose a\ncompression-resistant backdoor attack based on feature consistency training. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first backdoor attack that is robust to\nimage compressions. First, both backdoor images and their compressed versions\nare input into the deep neural network (DNN) for training. Then, the feature of\neach image is extracted by internal layers of the DNN. Next, the feature\ndifference between backdoor images and their compressed versions are minimized.\nAs a result, the DNN treats the feature of compressed images as the feature of\nbackdoor images in feature space. After training, the backdoor attack against\nDNN is robust to image compression. Furthermore, we consider three different\nimage compressions (i.e., JPEG, JPEG2000, WEBP) in feature consistency\ntraining, so that the backdoor attack is robust to multiple image compression\nalgorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness\nof the proposed backdoor attack. When the backdoor instances are compressed,\nthe attack success rate of common backdoor attack is lower than 10%, while the\nattack success rate of our compression-resistant backdoor is greater than 97%.\nThe compression-resistant attack is still robust even when the backdoor images\nare compressed with low compression quality. In addition, extensive experiments\nhave demonstrated that, our compression-resistant backdoor attack has the\ngeneralization ability to resist image compression which is not used in the\ntraining process.",

    "abstract": "Multi-touch attribution (MTA), aiming to estimate the contribution of each\nadvertisement touchpoint in conversion journeys, is essential for budget\nallocation and automatically advertising. Existing methods first train a model\nto predict the conversion probability of the advertisement journeys with\nhistorical data and calculate the attribution of each touchpoint using\ncounterfactual predictions. An assumption of these works is the conversion\nprediction model is unbiased, i.e., it can give accurate predictions on any\nrandomly assigned journey, including both the factual and counterfactual ones.\nNevertheless, this assumption does not always hold as the exposed\nadvertisements are recommended according to user preferences. This confounding\nbias of users would lead to an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in the\ncounterfactual prediction and cause concept drift in attribution. In this\npaper, we define the causal MTA task and propose CausalMTA to eliminate the\ninfluence of user preferences. It systemically eliminates the confounding bias\nfrom both static and dynamic preferences to learn the conversion prediction\nmodel using historical data. We also provide a theoretical analysis to prove\nCausalMTA can learn an unbiased prediction model with sufficient data.\nExtensive experiments on both public datasets and the impression data in an\ne-commerce company show that CausalMTA not only achieves better prediction\nperformance than the state-of-the-art method but also generates meaningful\nattribution credits across different advertising channels.",

Characterizing the content of the messages becomes vital for different\ntasks, like breaking news detection, personalized message recommendation, fake\nusers detection, information flow characterization and others. However, Twitter\nposts are short and often less coherent than other text documents, which makes\nit challenging to apply text mining algorithms to these datasets efficiently.\nTweet-pooling (aggregating tweets into longer documents) has been shown to\nimprove automatic topic decomposition, but the performance achieved in this\ntask varies depending on the pooling method.\nIn this paper, we propose a new pooling scheme for topic modeling in Twitter,\nwhich groups tweets whose authors belong to the same community (group of users\nwho mainly interact with each other but not with other groups) on a user\ninteraction graph. We present a complete evaluation of this methodology, state\nof the art schemes and previous pooling models in terms of the cluster quality,\ndocument retrieval tasks performance and supervised machine learning\nclassification score. Results show that our Community polling method\noutperformed other methods on the majority of metrics in two heterogeneous\ndatasets, while also reducing the running time.

    "abstract": "Large-scale or high-resolution geologic models usually comprise a huge number\nof grid blocks, which can be computationally demanding and time-consuming to\nsolve with numerical simulators. Therefore, it is advantageous to upscale\ngeologic models (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) from fine-scale (high-resolution\ngrids) to coarse-scale systems. Numerical upscaling methods have been proven to\nbe effective and robust for coarsening geologic models, but their efficiency\nremains to be improved. In this work, a deep-learning-based method is proposed\nto upscale the fine-scale geologic models, which can assist to improve\nupscaling efficiency significantly. In the deep learning method, a deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to approximate the relationship\nbetween the coarse grid of hydraulic conductivity fields and the hydraulic\nheads, which can then be utilized to replace the numerical solvers while\nsolving the flow equations for each coarse block. In addition, physical laws\n(e.g., governing equations and periodic boundary conditions) can also be\nincorporated into the training process of the deep CNN model, which is termed\nthe theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN). With the physical\ninformation considered, dependence on the data volume of training the deep\nlearning models can be reduced greatly. Several subsurface flow cases are\nintroduced to test the performance of the proposed deep-learning-based\nupscaling method, including 2D and 3D cases, and isotropic and anisotropic\ncases. The results show that the deep learning method can provide equivalent\nupscaling accuracy to the numerical method, and efficiency can be improved\nsignificantly compared to numerical upscaling.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit the constrained and stochastic continuous\nsubmodular maximization in both offline and online settings. For each\n$\\gamma$-weakly DR-submodular function $f$, we use the factor-revealing\noptimization equation to derive an optimal auxiliary function $F$, whose\nstationary points provide a $(1-e^{-\\gamma})$-approximation to the global\nmaximum value (denoted as $OPT$) of problem\n$\\max_{\\boldsymbol{x}\\in\\mathcal{C}}f(\\boldsymbol{x})$. Naturally, the\nprojected (mirror) gradient ascent relied on this non-oblivious function\nachieves $(1-e^{-\\gamma}-\\epsilon^{2})OPT-\\epsilon$ after $O(1/\\epsilon^{2})$\niterations, beating the traditional\n$(\\frac{\\gamma^{2}}{1+\\gamma^{2}})$-approximation gradient ascent\n\\citep{hassani2017gradient} for submodular maximization. Similarly, based on\n$F$, the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm equipped with variance reduction\ntechnique \\citep{mokhtari2018conditional} also returns a solution with\nobjective value larger than $(1-e^{-\\gamma}-\\epsilon^{2})OPT-\\epsilon$ after\n$O(1/\\epsilon^{3})$ iterations. In the online setting, we first consider the\nadversarial delays for stochastic gradient feedback, under which we propose a\nboosting online gradient algorithm with the same non-oblivious search,\nachieving a regret of $\\sqrt{D}$ (where $D$ is the sum of delays of gradient\nfeedback) against a $(1-e^{-\\gamma})$-approximation to the best feasible\nsolution in hindsight. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the\nefficiency of our boosting methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of registering multiple point clouds\ncorrupted with high anisotropic localization noise. Our approach follows the\nwidely used framework of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) reconstruction with an\nexpectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Existing methods are based on an\nimplicit assumption of space-invariant isotropic Gaussian noise. However, this\nassumption is violated in practice in applications such as single molecule\nlocalization microscopy (SMLM). To address this issue, we propose to introduce\nan explicit localization noise model that decouples shape modeling with the GMM\nfrom noise handling. We design a stochastic EM algorithm that considers\nnoise-free data as a latent variable, with closed-form solutions at each EM\nstep. The first advantage of our approach is to handle space-variant and\nanisotropic Gaussian noise with arbitrary covariances. The second advantage is\nto leverage the explicit noise model to impose prior knowledge about the noise\nthat may be available from physical sensors. We show on various simulated data\nthat our noise handling strategy improves significantly the robustness to high\nlevels of anisotropic noise. We also demonstrate the performance of our method\non real SMLM data.",

However, existing strategies cannot\ntake advantage of semi-supervised information, only distinguishing the\nimportance of views from a data feature perspective, which is often influenced\nby low-quality views then leading to poor performance. In this paper, by\nestablishing a link between labeled data and the importance of different views,\nwe propose an auto-weighted strategy to evaluate the importance of views from a\nlabel perspective to avoid the negative impact of unimportant or low-quality\nviews. Based on this strategy, we propose a transductive semi-supervised\nauto-weighted multi-view classification model. The initialization of the\nproposed model can be effectively determined by labeled data, which is\npractical. The model is decoupled into three small-scale sub-problems that can\nefficiently be optimized with a local convergence guarantee. The experimental\nresults on classification tasks show that the proposed method achieves optimal\nor sub-optimal classification accuracy at the lowest computational cost\ncompared to other related methods, and the weight change experiments show that\nour proposed strategy can distinguish view importance more accurately than\nother related strategies on multi-view datasets with low-quality views.",

Therefore, this\nstudy presents a new approach using different machine learning and deep\nlearning algorithms applied to Brazilian COVID-19 data. First, a clustering\nalgorithm is used to identify counties with similar sociodemographic behavior,\nwhile Benford's law is used to check for data manipulation. Based on these\nresults we are able to correctly model SARIMA models based on the clusters to\npredict new daily cases. The unsupervised machine learning techniques optimized\nthe process of defining the parameters of the SARIMA model. This framework can\nalso be useful to propose confinement scenarios during the so-called second\nwave. We have used the 645 counties from S\\~ao Paulo state, the most populous\nstate in Brazil. However, this methodology can be used in other states or\ncountries. This paper demonstrates how different techniques of machine\nlearning, deep learning, data mining and statistics can be used together to\nproduce important results when dealing with pandemic data.

Ensuring the proper functioning of a BSS is crucial given that these\nsystems are committed to eradicating many of the current global concerns, by\npromoting environmental and economic sustainability and contributing to\nimproving the life quality of the population. Good knowledge of users'\ntransition patterns is a decisive contribution to the quality and operability\nof the service.

ANNs require\na large amount of data to have strong out of sample performance, and many\nalgorithms for training ANN parameters are based on stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD). However, the SGD ANNs that tend to perform best on prediction tasks are\ntrained in an end to end manner that requires a large number of model\nparameters and random initialization. This means training ANNs is very time\nconsuming and the resulting models take a lot of memory to deploy. In order to\ntrain more parsimonious ANN models, we propose the use of alternative methods\nfrom the constrained optimization literature for ANN training and pretraining.\nIn particular, we propose novel mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations\nfor training fully-connected ANNs. Our formulations can account for both binary\nactivation and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation ANNs, and for the use of\na log likelihood loss. We also develop a layer-wise greedy approach, a\ntechnique adapted for reducing the number of layers in the ANN, for model\npretraining using our MIP formulations.

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing interest in the use of a SmallSat platform\nfor the future Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS) to allow for\ncost-effectiveness and rapid deployment. However, many design choices are yet\nto be finalized for the SmallSat-based LNSS, including the onboard clock and\nthe orbit type. As compared to the legacy Earth-GPS, designing an LNSS poses\nunique challenges: (a) restricted Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) of the onboard\nclock, which limits the timing stability; (b) limited lunar ground monitoring\nstations, which engenders a greater preference toward stable LNSS satellite\norbits.\nIn this current work, we analyze the trade-off between different design\nconsiderations related to the onboard clock and the lunar orbit type for\ndesigning an LNSS with time-transfer from Earth-GPS. Our proposed time-transfer\narchitecture combines the intermittently available Earth-GPS signals in a\ntiming filter to alleviate the cost and SWaP requirements of the onboard\nclocks. Specifically, we conduct multiple case studies with different grades of\nlow-SWaP clocks and various previously studied lunar orbit types. We estimate\nthe lunar User Equivalent Range Error (UERE) metric to characterize the ranging\naccuracy of signals transmitted from an LNSS satellite. Using the Systems Tool\nKit (STK)-based simulation setup from Analytical Graphics, Inc. (AGI), we\nevaluate the lunar UERE across various case studies of the LNSS design to\ndemonstrate comparable performance as that of the legacy Earth-GPS, even while\nusing a low-SWaP onboard clock. We further perform sensitivity analysis to\ninvestigate the variation in the lunar UERE metric across different case\nstudies as the Earth-GPS measurement update rates are varied.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a\nNeural Network (NN) model on their private data without revealing the data.\nRecently, several targeted poisoning attacks against FL have been introduced.\nThese attacks inject a backdoor into the resulting model that allows\nadversary-controlled inputs to be misclassified. Existing countermeasures\nagainst backdoor attacks are inefficient and often merely aim to exclude\ndeviating models from the aggregation. However, this approach also removes\nbenign models of clients with deviating data distributions, causing the\naggregated model to perform poorly for such clients.\nTo address this problem, we propose DeepSight, a novel model filtering\napproach for mitigating backdoor attacks. It is based on three novel techniques\nthat allow to characterize the distribution of data used to train model updates\nand seek to measure fine-grained differences in the internal structure and\noutputs of NNs. Using these techniques, DeepSight can identify suspicious model\nupdates. We also develop a scheme that can accurately cluster model updates.\nCombining the results of both components, DeepSight is able to identify and\neliminate model clusters containing poisoned models with high attack impact. We\nalso show that the backdoor contributions of possibly undetected poisoned\nmodels can be effectively mitigated with existing weight clipping-based\ndefenses. We evaluate the performance and effectiveness of DeepSight and show\nthat it can mitigate state-of-the-art backdoor attacks with a negligible impact\non the model's performance on benign data.",

FaceQgen\ndoes not require labelled quality measures for training. It is trained from\nscratch using the SCface database. FaceQgen applies image restoration to a face\nimage of unknown quality, transforming it into a canonical high quality image,\ni.e., frontal pose, homogeneous background, etc. The quality estimation is\nbuilt as the similarity between the original and the restored images, since low\nquality images experience bigger changes due to restoration. We compare three\ndifferent numerical quality measures: a) the MSE between the original and the\nrestored images, b) their SSIM, and c) the output score of the Discriminator of\nthe GAN. The results demonstrate that FaceQgen's quality measures are good\nestimators of face recognition accuracy. Our experiments include a comparison\nwith other quality assessment methods designed for faces and for general\nimages, in order to position FaceQgen in the state of the art. This comparison\nshows that, even though FaceQgen does not surpass the best existing face\nquality assessment methods in terms of face recognition accuracy prediction, it\nachieves good enough results to demonstrate the potential of semi-supervised\nlearning approaches for quality estimation (in particular, data-driven learning\nbased on a single high quality image per subject), having the capacity to\nimprove its performance in the future with adequate refinement of the model and\nthe significant advantage over competing methods of not needing quality labels\nfor its development.

    "abstract": "Many 3D representations (e.g., point clouds) are discrete samples of the\nunderlying continuous 3D surface. This process inevitably introduces sampling\nvariations on the underlying 3D shapes. In learning 3D representation, the\nvariations should be disregarded while transferable knowledge of the underlying\n3D shape should be captured. This becomes a grand challenge in existing\nrepresentation learning paradigms. This paper studies autoencoding on point\nclouds. The standard autoencoding paradigm forces the encoder to capture such\nsampling variations as the decoder has to reconstruct the original point cloud\nthat has sampling variations. We introduce Implicit Autoencoder(IAE), a simple\nyet effective method that addresses this challenge by replacing the point cloud\ndecoder with an implicit decoder. The implicit decoder outputs a continuous\nrepresentation that is shared among different point cloud sampling of the same\nmodel. Reconstructing under the implicit representation can prioritize that the\nencoder discards sampling variations, introducing more space to learn useful\nfeatures. We theoretically justify this claim under a simple linear\nautoencoder. Moreover, the implicit decoder offers a rich space to design\nsuitable implicit representations for different tasks. We demonstrate the\nusefulness of IAE across various self-supervised learning tasks for both 3D\nobjects and 3D scenes. Experimental results show that IAE consistently\noutperforms the state-of-the-art in each task.",

When navigating the vast space\nof available topics using embedded hyperlinks, readers follow different\ntrajectories in terms of the sequence of articles. Understanding these\nnavigation patterns is crucial to better serve readers' needs and address\nstructural biases and knowledge gaps. However, systematic studies of navigation\nin Wikipedia are limited because of a lack of publicly available data due to\nthe commitment to protect readers' privacy by not storing or sharing\npotentially sensitive data. In this paper, we address the question: how well\nnavigation of readers can be approximated by using publicly available\nresources, most notably the Wikipedia clickstream data? We systematically\nquantify the difference between real and synthetic navigation sequences\ngenerated from the clickstream data, through 6 different experiments across 8\nWikipedia language versions.

The idea is based on using a shared log among processes running\nthe same protected code. Importantly, the approach can be library based,\nrequiring very little if any change to standard code -- code just needs to use\nthe idempotent versions of memory operations (load, store, LL/SC, allocation,\nfree).\nWe have implemented a C++ library called Flock based on the ideas.

We implemented a variety of tree and list-based data\nstructures with Flock and compare the performance of the lock-free and blocking\nmodes under a variety of workloads.

    "abstract": "Training deep models for RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) often requires\na large number of labeled RGB-D images. However, RGB-D data is not easily\nacquired, which limits the development of RGB-D SOD techniques. To alleviate\nthis issue, we present a Dual-Semi RGB-D Salient Object Detection Network\n(DS-Net) to leverage unlabeled RGB images for boosting RGB-D saliency\ndetection. We first devise a depth decoupling convolutional neural network\n(DDCNN), which contains a depth estimation branch and a saliency detection\nbranch. The depth estimation branch is trained with RGB-D images and then used\nto estimate the pseudo depth maps for all unlabeled RGB images to form the\npaired data. The saliency detection branch is used to fuse the RGB feature and\ndepth feature to predict the RGB-D saliency. Then, the whole DDCNN is assigned\nas the backbone in a teacher-student framework for semi-supervised learning.\nMoreover, we also introduce a consistency loss on the intermediate attention\nand saliency maps for the unlabeled data, as well as a supervised depth and\nsaliency loss for labeled data. Experimental results on seven widely-used\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that our DDCNN outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also demonstrate that our\nsemi-supervised DS-Net can further improve the performance, even when using an\nRGB image with the pseudo depth map.",

Let $x\\in V$ and ${\\cal H}\\subseteq {\\cal\nG}$ be the Lie algebra of its stabilizer. Our objective is to understand points\n$[y]$, and their stabilizers which occur in the vicinity of $[x]$. We construct\nan explicit ${\\cal G}$-action on a suitable neighbourhood of $x$, which we call\nthe local model at $x$. We show that Lie algebras of stabilizers of points in\nthe vicinity of $x$ are parameterized by subspaces of ${\\cal H}$. When ${\\cal\nH}$ is reductive these are Lie subalgebras of ${\\cal H}$. If the orbit of $x$\nis closed this also follows from Luna's theorem. Our construction involves a\nmap connected to the local curvature form at $x$. We apply the local model to\nforms, when the form $g$ is obtained from the form $f$ as the leading term of a\none parameter family acting on $f$. We show that there is a flattening ${\\cal\nK}_0$ of ${\\cal K}$, the stabilizer of $f$ which sits as a subalgebra of ${\\cal\nH}$, the stabilizer $g$. We specialize to the case of forms $f$ whose\n$SL(X)$-orbits are affine, and the orbit of $g$ is of co-dimension $1$. We show\nthat (i) either ${\\cal H}$ has a very simple structure, or (ii) conjugates of\nthe elements of ${\\cal K}$ also stabilize $g$ and the tangent of exit. Next, we\napply this to the adjoint action. We show that for a general matrix $X$, the\nsignatures of nilpotent matrices in its projective orbit closure (under\nconjugation) are determined by the multiplicity data of the spectrum of $X$.\nFinally, we formulate the path problem of finding paths with specific\nproperties from $y$ to its limit points $x$ as an optimization problem using\nlocal differential geometry.

We decompose the restoration\ntask into two stages of degradation localization and degraded region-guided\nrestoration, unlike existing methods which directly learn a mapping between the\ndegraded and clean images.

Here we clarify the essential logic behind\nphylogenetic comparative methods and their fundamental relatedness to a deep\nintellectual tradition focussed on sampling. Then we introduce concepts,\nmethods and tools which will enable typologists to use these methods in\neveryday typological research. The key commonality of phylogenetic comparative\nmethods and balanced sampling is that they attempt to deal with statistical\nnon-independence due to genealogy. Whereas sampling can never achieve\nindependence and requires most comparative data to be discarded, phylogenetic\ncomparative methods achieve independence while retaining and using all data. We\ndiscuss the essential notions of phylogenetic signal; uncertainty about trees;\ntypological averages and proportions that are sensitive to genealogy;\ncomparison across language families; and the effects of areality.

The proposed design is based on the intuitively\npleasing idea of integrating more than one motion within a single SSmVEP target\nstimuli, simultaneously. To elicit SSmVEP, we designed a novel and innovative\ndual frequency aggregated modulation paradigm, referred to as the Dual\nFrequency Aggregated steady-state motion Visual Evoked Potential (DF-SSmVEP),\nby concurrently integrating \"Radial Zoom\" and \"Rotation\" motions in a single\ntarget without increasing the trial length. Compared to conventional SSmVEPs,\nthe proposed DF-SSmVEP framework consists of two motion modes integrated and\nshown simultaneously each modulated by a specific target frequency. The paper\nalso develops a specific unsupervised classification model, referred to as the\nBifold Canonical Correlation Analysis (BCCA), based on two motion frequencies\nper target. The proposed DF-SSmVEP is evaluated based on a real EEG dataset and\nthe results corroborate its superiority. The proposed DF-SSmVEP outperforms its\ncounterparts and achieved an average ITR of 30.7 +/- 1.97 and an average\naccuracy of 92.5 +/- 2.04.",

    "abstract": "As machine learning powered decision making is playing an increasingly\nimportant role in our daily lives, it is imperative to strive for fairness of\nthe underlying data processing and algorithms. We propose a pre-processing\nalgorithm for fair data representation via which L2- objective supervised\nlearning algorithms result in an estimation of the Pareto frontier between\nprediction error and statistical disparity. In particular, the present work\napplies the optimal positive definite affine transport maps to approach the\npost-processing Wasserstein barycenter characterization of the optimal fair\nL2-objective supervised learning via a pre-processing data deformation. We call\nthe resulting data Wasserstein pseudo-barycenter. Furthermore, we show that the\nWasserstein geodesics from the learning outcome marginals to the barycenter\ncharacterizes the Pareto frontier between L2-loss and total Wasserstein\ndistance among learning outcome marginals. Thereby, an application of McCann\ninterpolation generalizes the pseudo-barycenter to a family of data\nrepresentations via which L2-objective supervised learning algorithms result in\nthe Pareto frontier. Numerical simulations underscore the advantages of the\nproposed data representation: (1) the pre-processing step is compositive with\narbitrary L2-objective supervised learning methods and unseen data; (2) the\nfair representation protects data privacy by preventing the training machine\nfrom direct or indirect access to the sensitive information of the data; (3)\nthe optimal affine map results in efficient computation of fair supervised\nlearning on high-dimensional data; (4) experimental results shed light on the\nfairness of L2-objective unsupervised learning via the proposed fair data\nrepresentation.",

    "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of abdominal organs in computed tomography (CT) images\ncan support radiation therapy and image-guided surgery workflows. Developing of\nsuch automatic solutions remains challenging mainly owing to complex organ\ninteractions and blurry boundaries in CT images. To address these issues, we\nfocus on effective spatial context modeling and explicit edge segmentation\npriors. Accordingly, we propose a 3D network with four main components trained\nend-to-end including shared encoder, edge detector, decoder with edge\nskip-connections (ESCs) and recurrent feature propagation head (RFP-Head). To\ncapture wide-range spatial dependencies, the RFP-Head propagates and harvests\nlocal features through directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) formulated with recurrent\nconnections in an efficient slice-wise manner, with regard to spatial\narrangement of image units. To leverage edge information, the edge detector\nlearns edge prior knowledge specifically tuned for semantic segmentation by\nexploiting intermediate features from the encoder with the edge supervision.\nThe ESCs then aggregate the edge knowledge with multi-level decoder features to\nlearn a hierarchy of discriminative features explicitly modeling\ncomplementarity between organs' interiors and edges for segmentation. We\nconduct extensive experiments on two challenging abdominal CT datasets with\neight annotated organs. Experimental results show that the proposed network\noutperforms several state-of-the-art models, especially for the segmentation of\nsmall and complicated structures (gallbladder, esophagus, stomach, pancreas and\nduodenum).

Recent advances in the field of graph\nsignal processing have made it possible to describe and analyze air pollution\nmonitoring networks using graphs. One of the main applications is the\nreconstruction of the measured signal in a graph using a subset of sensors.\nReconstructing the signal using information from sensor neighbors can help\nimprove the quality of network data, examples are filling in missing data with\ncorrelated neighboring nodes, or correcting a drifting sensor with neighboring\nsensors that are more accurate. This paper compares the use of various types of\ngraph signal reconstruction methods applied to real data sets of Spanish air\npollution reference stations. The methods considered are Laplacian\ninterpolation, graph signal processing low-pass based graph signal\nreconstruction, and kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, and are compared\non actual air pollution data sets measuring O3, NO2, and PM10. The ability of\nthe methods to reconstruct the signal of a pollutant is shown, as well as the\ncomputational cost of this reconstruction. The results indicate the superiority\nof methods based on kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, as well as the\ndifficulties of the methods to scale in an air pollution monitoring network\nwith a large number of low-cost sensors.

    "abstract": "An independent set in a graph is a set of pairwise non-adjacent vertices. Let\n$\\alpha(G)$ denote the cardinality of a maximum independent set in the graph $G\n= (V, E)$. Gutman and Harary defined the independence polynomial of $G$\n\\[\nI(G;x) =\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\alpha(G)}{s_k}x^{k}={s_0}+{s_1}x+{s_2}x^{2}+...+{s_{\\alpha(G)}}x^{\\alpha(G)},\n\\]\nwhere $s_k$ denotes the number of independent sets of cardinality $k$ in the\ngraph $G$. A comprehensive survey on the subject is due to Levit and Mandrescu,\nwhere some recursive formulas are allowing to calculate the independence\npolynomial. A direct implementation of these recursions does not bring about an\nefficient algorithm. Yosef, Mizrachi, and Kadrawi developed an efficient way\nfor computing the independence polynomials of trees with $n$ vertices, such\nthat a database containing all of the independence polynomials of all the trees\nwith up to $n-1$ vertices is required. This approach is not suitable for big\ntrees, as an extensive database is needed. On the other hand, using dynamic\nprogramming, it is possible to develop an efficient algorithm that prevents\nrepeated calculations. In summary, our dynamic programming algorithm runs over\na tree in linear time and does not depend on a database.",

    "title": "Transfer-learning-based Surrogate Model for Thermal Conductivity of  Nanofluids",
    "abstract": "Heat transfer characteristics of nanofluids have been extensively studied\nsince the 1990s. Research investigations show that the suspended nanoparticles\nsignificantly alter the suspension's thermal properties. The thermal\nconductivity of nanofluids is one of the properties that is generally found to\nbe greater than that of the base fluid. This increase in thermal conductivity\nis found to depend on several parameters. Several theories have been proposed\nto model the thermal conductivities of nanofluids, but there is no reliable\nuniversal theory yet to model the anomalous thermal conductivity of nanofluids.\nIn recent years, supervised data-driven methods have been successfully employed\nto create surrogate models across various scientific disciplines, especially\nfor modeling difficult-to-understand phenomena. These supervised learning\nmethods allow the models to capture highly non-linear phenomena. In this work,\nwe have taken advantage of existing correlations and used them concurrently\nwith available experimental results to develop more robust surrogate models for\npredicting the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Artificial neural networks\nare trained using the transfer learning approach to predict the thermal\nconductivity enhancement of nanofluids with spherical particles for 32\ndifferent particle-fluid combinations (8 particles materials and 4 fluids). The\nlarge amount of lower accuracy data generated from correlations is used to\ncoarse-tune the model parameters, and the limited amount of more trustworthy\nexperimental data is used to fine-tune the model parameters. The transfer\nlearning-based models' results are compared with those from baseline models\nwhich are trained only on experimental data using a goodness of fit metric. It\nis found that the transfer learning models perform better with goodness of fit\nvalues of 0.93 as opposed to 0.83 from the baseline models.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, and in part its effective\ndiagnosis and treatment depend on the accurate delineation of the tumor.\nHuman-centered segmentation, which is currently the most common approach, is\nsubject to inter-observer variability, and is also time-consuming, considering\nthe fact that only experts are capable of providing annotations. Automatic and\nsemi-automatic tumor segmentation methods have recently shown promising\nresults. However, as different researchers have validated their algorithms\nusing various datasets and performance metrics, reliably evaluating these\nmethods is still an open challenge. The goal of the Lung-Originated Tumor\nSegmentation from Computed Tomography Scan (LOTUS) Benchmark created through\n2018 IEEE Video and Image Processing (VIP) Cup competition, is to provide a\nunique dataset and pre-defined metrics, so that different researchers can\ndevelop and evaluate their methods in a unified fashion. The 2018 VIP Cup\nstarted with a global engagement from 42 countries to access the competition\ndata. At the registration stage, there were 129 members clustered into 28 teams\nfrom 10 countries, out of which 9 teams made it to the final stage and 6 teams\nsuccessfully completed all the required tasks. In a nutshell, all the\nalgorithms proposed during the competition, are based on deep learning models\ncombined with a false positive reduction technique. Methods developed by the\nthree finalists show promising results in tumor segmentation, however, more\neffort should be put into reducing the false positive rate. This competition\nmanuscript presents an overview of the VIP-Cup challenge, along with the\nproposed algorithms and results.",

    "abstract": "Ophthalmologists have used fundus images to screen and diagnose eye diseases.\nHowever, different equipments and ophthalmologists pose large variations to the\nquality of fundus images. Low-quality (LQ) degraded fundus images easily lead\nto uncertainty in clinical screening and generally increase the risk of\nmisdiagnosis. Thus, real fundus image restoration is worth studying.\nUnfortunately, real clinical benchmark has not been explored for this task so\nfar. In this paper, we investigate the real clinical fundus image restoration\nproblem. Firstly, We establish a clinical dataset, Real Fundus (RF), including\n120 low- and high-quality (HQ) image pairs. Then we propose a novel\nTransformer-based Generative Adversarial Network (RFormer) to restore the real\ndegradation of clinical fundus images. The key component in our network is the\nWindow-based Self-Attention Block (WSAB) which captures non-local\nself-similarity and long-range dependencies. To produce more visually pleasant\nresults, a Transformer-based discriminator is introduced. Extensive experiments\non our clinical benchmark show that the proposed RFormer significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In addition, experiments of\ndownstream tasks such as vessel segmentation and optic disc/cup detection\ndemonstrate that our proposed RFormer benefits clinical fundus image analysis\nand applications.

    "abstract": "The direction-of-arrival (DOA) of sound sources is an essential acoustic\nparameter used, e.g., for multi-channel speech enhancement or source tracking.\nComplex acoustic scenarios consisting of sources-of-interest, interfering\nsources, reverberation, and noise make the estimation of the DOAs corresponding\nto the sources-of-interest a challenging task. Recently proposed attention\nmechanisms allow DOA estimators to focus on the sources-of-interest and\ndisregard interference and noise, i.e., they are signal-aware. The attention is\ntypically obtained by a deep neural network (DNN) from a short-time Fourier\ntransform (STFT) based representation of a single microphone signal.\nSubsequently, attention has been applied as binary or ratio weighting to\nSTFT-based microphone signal representations to reduce the impact of frequency\nbins dominated by noise, interference, or reverberation. The impact of\nattention on DOA estimators and different training strategies for attention and\nDOA DNNs are not yet studied in depth. In this paper, we evaluate systems\nconsisting of different DNNs and signal processing-based methods for DOA\nestimation when attention is applied. Additionally, we propose training\nstrategies for attention-based DOA estimation optimized via a DOA objective,\ni.e., end-to-end. The evaluation of the proposed and the baseline systems is\nperformed using data generated with simulated and measured room impulse\nresponses under various acoustic conditions, like reverberation times, noise,\nand source array distances. Overall, DOA estimation using attention in\ncombination with signal-processing methods exhibits a far lower computational\ncomplexity than a fully DNN-based system; however, it yields comparable\nresults.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a notoriously noisy\nmeasurement of brain activity because of the large variations between\nindividuals, signals marred by environmental differences during collection, and\nspatiotemporal averaging required by the measurement resolution. In addition,\nthe data is extremely high dimensional, with the space of the activity\ntypically having much lower intrinsic dimension. In order to understand the\nconnection between stimuli of interest and brain activity, and analyze\ndifferences and commonalities between subjects, it becomes important to learn a\nmeaningful embedding of the data that denoises, and reveals its intrinsic\nstructure. Specifically, we assume that while noise varies significantly\nbetween individuals, true responses to stimuli will share common,\nlow-dimensional features between subjects which are jointly discoverable.\nSimilar approaches have been exploited previously but they have mainly used\nlinear methods such as PCA and shared response modeling (SRM). In contrast, we\npropose a neural network called MRMD-AE (manifold-regularized multiple decoder,\nautoencoder), that learns a common embedding from multiple subjects in an\nexperiment while retaining the ability to decode to individual raw fMRI\nsignals. We show that our learned common space represents an extensible\nmanifold (where new points not seen during training can be mapped), improves\nthe classification accuracy of stimulus features of unseen timepoints, as well\nas improves cross-subject translation of fMRI signals.

    "abstract": "To meet the growing mobility needs in intra-city transportation, the concept\nof urban air mobility (UAM) has been proposed in which vertical takeoff and\nlanding (VTOL) aircraft are used to provide a ride-hailing service. In UAM,\naircraft can operate in designated air spaces known as corridors, that link the\naerodromes. A reliable communication network between GBSs and aircraft enables\nUAM to adequately utilize the airspace and create a fast, efficient, and safe\ntransportation system. In this paper, to characterize the wireless connectivity\nperformance for UAM, a spatial model is proposed. For this setup, the\ndistribution of the distance between an arbitrarily selected GBS and its\nassociated aircraft and the Laplace transform of the interference experienced\nby the GBS are derived. Using these results, the signal-to-interference ratio\n(SIR)-based connectivity probability is determined to capture the connectivity\nperformance of the UAM aircraft-to-ground communication network. Then,\nleveraging these connectivity results, a wireless-enabled asynchronous\nfederated learning (AFL) framework that uses a Fourier neural network is\nproposed to tackle the challenging problem of turbulence prediction during UAM\noperations. For this AFL scheme, a staleness-aware global aggregation scheme is\nintroduced to expedite the convergence to the optimal turbulence prediction\nmodel used by UAM aircraft. Simulation results validate the theoretical\nderivations for the UAM wireless connectivity. The results also demonstrate\nthat the proposed AFL framework converges to the optimal turbulence prediction\nmodel faster than the synchronous federated learning baselines and a\nstaleness-free AFL approach. Furthermore, the results characterize the\nperformance of wireless connectivity and convergence of the aircraft's\nturbulence model under different parameter settings, offering useful UAM design\nguidelines.",

    "title": "Feature matching as improved transfer learning technique for wearable  EEG",
    "abstract": "Objective: With the rapid rise of wearable sleep monitoring devices with\nnon-conventional electrode configurations, there is a need for automated\nalgorithms that can perform sleep staging on configurations with small amounts\nof labeled data. Transfer learning has the ability to adapt neural network\nweights from a source modality (e.g. standard electrode configuration) to a new\ntarget modality (e.g. non-conventional electrode configuration). Methods: We\npropose feature matching, a new transfer learning strategy as an alternative to\nthe commonly used finetuning approach. This method consists of training a model\nwith larger amounts of data from the source modality and few paired samples of\nsource and target modality. For those paired samples, the model extracts\nfeatures of the target modality, matching these to the features from the\ncorresponding samples of the source modality. Results: We compare feature\nmatching to finetuning for three different target domains, with two different\nneural network architectures, and with varying amounts of training data.\nParticularly on small cohorts (i.e. 2 - 5 labeled recordings in the\nnon-conventional recording setting), feature matching systematically\noutperforms finetuning with mean relative differences in accuracy ranging from\n0.4% to 4.7% for the different scenarios and datasets. Conclusion: Our findings\nsuggest that feature matching outperforms finetuning as a transfer learning\napproach, especially in very low data regimes. Significance: As such, we\nconclude that feature matching is a promising new method for wearable sleep\nstaging with novel devices.",

    "title": "PowerGraph: Using neural networks and principal components to  multivariate statistical power trade-offs",
    "abstract": "It is increasingly acknowledged that a priori statistical power estimation\nfor planned studies with multiple model parameters is inherently a multivariate\nproblem. Power for individual parameters of interest cannot be reliably\nestimated univariately because sampling variably in, correlation with, and\nvariance explained relative to one parameter will impact the power for another\nparameter, all usual univariate considerations being equal. Explicit solutions\nin such cases, especially for models with many parameters, are either\nimpractical or impossible to solve, leaving researchers with the prevailing\nmethod of simulating power. However, point estimates for a vector of model\nparameters are uncertain, and the impact of inaccuracy is unknown. In such\ncases, sensitivity analysis is recommended such that multiple combinations of\npossible observable parameter vectors are simulated to understand power\ntrade-offs. A limitation to this approach is that it is computationally\nexpensive to generate sufficient sensitivity combinations to accurately map the\npower trade-off function in increasingly high dimensional spaces for the models\nthat social scientists estimate. This paper explores the efficient estimation\nand graphing of statistical power for a study over varying model parameter\ncombinations. Optimally powering a study is crucial to ensure a minimum\nprobability of finding the hypothesized effect. We first demonstrate the impact\nof varying parameter values on power for specific hypotheses of interest and\nquantify the computational intensity of computing such a graph for a given\nlevel of precision. Finally, we propose a simple and generalizable machine\nlearning inspired solution to cut the computational cost to less than 7\\% of\nwhat could be called a brute force approach. [abridged]",

    "title": "Faster Unbalanced Optimal Transport: Translation invariant Sinkhorn and  1-D Frank-Wolfe",
    "abstract": "Unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) extends optimal transport (OT) to take\ninto account mass variations to compare distributions. This is crucial to make\nOT successful in ML applications, making it robust to data normalization and\noutliers. The baseline algorithm is Sinkhorn, but its convergence speed might\nbe significantly slower for UOT than for OT. In this work, we identify the\ncause for this deficiency, namely the lack of a global normalization of the\niterates, which equivalently corresponds to a translation of the dual OT\npotentials. Our first contribution leverages this idea to develop a provably\naccelerated Sinkhorn algorithm (coined 'translation invariant Sinkhorn') for\nUOT, bridging the computational gap with OT. Our second contribution focusses\non 1-D UOT and proposes a Frank-Wolfe solver applied to this translation\ninvariant formulation. The linear oracle of each steps amounts to solving a 1-D\nOT problems, resulting in a linear time complexity per iteration. Our last\ncontribution extends this method to the computation of UOT barycenter of 1-D\nmeasures. Numerical simulations showcase the convergence speed improvement\nbrought by these three approaches.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common fatal cancer in the world.\nPolypectomy can effectively interrupt the progression of adenoma to\nadenocarcinoma, thus reducing the risk of CRC development. Colonoscopy is the\nprimary method to find colonic polyps. However, due to the different sizes of\npolyps and the unclear boundary between polyps and their surrounding mucosa, it\nis challenging to segment polyps accurately. To address this problem, we design\na Boundary Distribution Guided Network (BDG-Net) for accurate polyp\nsegmentation. Specifically, under the supervision of the ideal Boundary\nDistribution Map (BDM), we use Boundary Distribution Generate Module (BDGM) to\naggregate high-level features and generate BDM. Then, BDM is sent to the\nBoundary Distribution Guided Decoder (BDGD) as complementary spatial\ninformation to guide the polyp segmentation. Moreover, a multi-scale feature\ninteraction strategy is adopted in BDGD to improve the segmentation accuracy of\npolyps with different sizes. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels remarkably on five public polyp datasets while maintaining low\ncomputational complexity.",

    "abstract": "Mobility management is the key feature of cellular networks. When integrating\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into cellular networks, their cell association\nneeds to be carefully managed for coexistence with other cellular users. UAVs\nmove in three dimensions and may traverse several cells on their flight path,\nand so may be subject to several handovers. In order to enable research on\nmobility management with UAV users, this paper describes the design,\nimplementation, and testing methodology for handover experiments with aerial\nusers. We leverage software-defined radios (SDRs) and implement a series of\ntools for preparing the experiment in the laboratory and for taking it outdoors\nfor field testing. We use solely commercial off-the-shelf hardware, open-source\nsoftware, and an experimental license to enable reproducible and scalable\nexperiments.

    "abstract": "We outline the general framework of machine learning (ML) methods for\nmulti-scale dynamical modeling of condensed matter systems, and in particular\nof strongly correlated electron models. Complex spatial temporal behaviors in\nthese systems often arise from the interplay between quasi-particles and the\nemergent dynamical classical degrees of freedom, such as local lattice\ndistortions, spins, and order-parameters. Central to the proposed framework is\nthe ML energy model that, by successfully emulating the time-consuming\nelectronic structure calculation, can accurately predict a local energy based\non the classical field in the intermediate neighborhood. In order to properly\ninclude the symmetry of the electron Hamiltonian, a crucial component of the ML\nenergy model is the descriptor that transforms the neighborhood configuration\ninto invariant feature variables, which are input to the learning model. A\ngeneral theory of the descriptor for the classical fields is formulated, and\ntwo types of models are distinguished depending on the presence or absence of\nan internal symmetry for the classical field. Several specific approaches to\nthe descriptor of the classical fields are presented. Our focus is on the\ngroup-theoretical method that offers a systematic and rigorous approach to\ncompute invariants based on the bispectrum coefficients. We propose an\nefficient implementation of the bispectrum method based on the concept of\nreference irreducible representations. Finally, the implementations of the\nvarious descriptors are demonstrated on well-known electronic lattice models.",

    "abstract": "Many existing region-of-attraction (ROA) analysis tools find difficulty in\naddressing feedback systems with large-scale neural network (NN) policies\nand/or high-dimensional sensing modalities such as cameras. In this paper, we\ntailor the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack method developed in the\nadversarial learning community as a general-purpose ROA analysis tool for\nlarge-scale nonlinear systems and end-to-end perception-based control. We show\nthat the ROA analysis can be approximated as a constrained maximization problem\nwhose goal is to find the worst-case initial condition which shifts the\nterminal state the most. Then we present two PGD-based iterative methods which\ncan be used to solve the resultant constrained maximization problem. Our\nanalysis is not based on Lyapunov theory, and hence requires minimum\ninformation of the problem structures. In the model-based setting, we show that\nthe PGD updates can be efficiently performed using back-propagation. In the\nmodel-free setting (which is more relevant to ROA analysis of perception-based\ncontrol), we propose a finite-difference PGD estimate which is general and only\nrequires a black-box simulator for generating the trajectories of the\nclosed-loop system given any initial state. We demonstrate the scalability and\ngenerality of our analysis tool on several numerical examples with large-scale\nNN policies and high-dimensional image observations. We believe that our\nproposed analysis serves as a meaningful initial step toward further\nunderstanding of closed-loop stability of large-scale nonlinear systems and\nperception-based control.",
