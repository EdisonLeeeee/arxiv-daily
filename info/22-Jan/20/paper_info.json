    "abstract": "Despite the rapid progress of neuromorphic computing, the inadequate depth\nand the resulting insufficient representation power of spiking neural networks\n(SNNs) severely restrict their application scope in practice. Residual learning\nand shortcuts have been evidenced as an important approach for training deep\nneural networks, but rarely did previous work assess their applicability to the\ncharacteristics of spike-based communication and spatiotemporal dynamics. This\nnegligence leads to impeded information flow and the accompanying degradation\nproblem. In this paper, we identify the crux and then propose a novel residual\nblock for SNNs, which is able to significantly extend the depth of directly\ntrained SNNs, e.g., up to 482 layers on CIFAR-10 and 104 layers on ImageNet,\nwithout observing any slight degradation problem. We validate the effectiveness\nof our methods on both frame-based and neuromorphic datasets, and our\nSRM-ResNet104 achieves a superior result of 76.02% accuracy on ImageNet, the\nfirst time in the domain of directly trained SNNs. The great energy efficiency\nis estimated and the resulting networks need on average only one spike per\nneuron for classifying an input sample. We believe our powerful and scalable\nmodeling will provide a strong support for further exploration of SNNs.",

    "abstract": "Directly training spiking neural networks (SNNs) has remained challenging due\nto complex neural dynamics and intrinsic non-differentiability in firing\nfunctions. The well-known backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm\nproposed to train SNNs suffers from large memory footprint and prohibits\nbackward and update unlocking, making it impossible to exploit the potential of\nlocally-supervised training methods. This work proposes an efficient and direct\ntraining algorithm for SNNs that integrates a locally-supervised training\nmethod with a temporally-truncated BPTT algorithm. The proposed algorithm\nexplores both temporal and spatial locality in BPTT and contributes to\nsignificant reduction in computational cost including GPU memory utilization,\nmain memory access and arithmetic operations. We thoroughly explore the design\nspace concerning temporal truncation length and local training block size and\nbenchmark their impact on classification accuracy of different networks running\ndifferent types of tasks. The results reveal that temporal truncation has a\nnegative effect on the accuracy of classifying frame-based datasets, but leads\nto improvement in accuracy on dynamic-vision-sensor (DVS) recorded datasets. In\nspite of resulting information loss, local training is capable of alleviating\noverfitting. The combined effect of temporal truncation and local training can\nlead to the slowdown of accuracy drop and even improvement in accuracy. In\naddition, training deep SNNs models such as AlexNet classifying CIFAR10-DVS\ndataset leads to 7.26% increase in accuracy, 89.94% reduction in GPU memory,\n10.79% reduction in memory access, and 99.64% reduction in MAC operations\ncompared to the standard end-to-end BPTT.",

    "abstract": "Uniswap, like other DEXs, has gained much attention this year because it is a\nnon-custodial and publicly verifiable exchange that allows users to trade\ndigital assets without trusted third parties. However, its simplicity and lack\nof regulation also makes it easy to execute initial coin offering scams by\nlisting non-valuable tokens. This method of performing scams is known as rug\npull, a phenomenon that already existed in traditional finance but has become\nmore relevant in DeFi. Various projects such as [34,37] have contributed to\ndetecting rug pulls in EVM compatible chains. However, the first longitudinal\nand academic step to detecting and characterizing scam tokens on Uniswap was\nmade in [44]. The authors collected all the transactions related to the Uniswap\nV2 exchange and proposed a machine learning algorithm to label tokens as scams.\nHowever, the algorithm is only valuable for detecting scams accurately after\nthey have been executed. This paper increases their data set by 20K tokens and\nproposes a new methodology to label tokens as scams. After manually analyzing\nthe data, we devised a theoretical classification of different malicious\nmaneuvers in Uniswap protocol. We propose various machine-learning-based\nalgorithms with new relevant features related to the token propagation and\nsmart contract heuristics to detect potential rug pulls before they occur. In\ngeneral, the models proposed achieved similar results. The best model obtained\nan accuracy of 0.9936, recall of 0.9540, and precision of 0.9838 in\ndistinguishing non-malicious tokens from scams prior to the malicious maneuver.",

However, there are advantages in having a rich domain model, where\ndomain entities are tightly connected, because it fosters an initial quick\ndevelopment. On the other hand, the split of the business logic into modules\nand/or services, its encapsulation through well-defined interfaces and the\nintroduction of inter-service communication introduces a cost in terms of\nperformance.

The impact on the\nmigration effort and on performance is measured for both steps. Current state\nof the art analyses the migration of monolith systems to a microservices\narchitecture, but we observed that migration effort and performance issues are\nalready significant in the migration to a modular monolith.

We\ncan easily represent multi-attribute data more compactly on a classical\ncomputer by replacing one-hot encoding with label encoding. However, replacing\nthese encoding schemes on a QC is not straightforward as PQM and P-PQM operate\nat the quantum bit level.\nWe present an enhanced P-PQM, called EP-PQM, that allows label encoding of\ndata stored in a PQM data structure and reduces the circuit depth of the data\nstorage and retrieval procedures. We show implementations for an ideal QC and a\nnoisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device.\nOur complexity analysis shows that the EP-PQM approach requires $O\\left(z\n\\log_2(a)\\right)$ qubits as opposed to $O(za)$ qubits for P-PQM. EP-PQM also\nrequires fewer gates, reducing gate count from $O\\left(rza\\right)$ to\n$O\\left(rz\\log_2(a)\\right)$.\nFor five datasets, we demonstrate that training an ML classification model\nusing EP-PQM requires 48% to 77% fewer qubits than P-PQM for datasets with\n$a>2$. EP-PQM reduces circuit depth in the range of 60% to 96%, depending on\nthe dataset. The depth decreases further with a decomposed circuit, ranging\nbetween 94% and 99%.\nEP-PQM requires less space; thus, it can train on and classify larger\ndatasets than previous PQM implementations on NISQ devices. Furthermore,\nreducing the number of gates speeds up the classification and reduces the noise\nassociated with deep quantum circuits. Thus, EP-PQM brings us closer to\nscalable ML on a NISQ device.",

However, functional languages\nhave been slow to adopt SSA and prefer to use intermediate representations\nbased on minimal lambda calculi due to SSA's inability to express higher order\nconstructs. We exploit a new SSA construct -- regions -- in order to express\nfunctional optimizations via classical SSA based reasoning. Region optimization\ncurrently relies on ad-hoc analyses and transformations on imperative programs.\nThese ad-hoc transformations are sufficient for imperative languages as regions\nare used in a limited fashion. In contrast, we use regions pervasively to model\nsub-expressions in our functional IR. This motivates us to systematize region\noptimizations. We extend classical SSA reasoning to regions for\nfunctional-style analyses and transformations.

    "abstract": "Social media data such as Twitter messages (\"tweets\") pose a particular\nchallenge to NLP systems because of their short, noisy, and colloquial nature.\nTasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and syntactic parsing require\nhighly domain-matched training data for good performance. While there are some\npublicly available annotated datasets of tweets, they are all purpose-built for\nsolving one task at a time. As yet there is no complete training corpus for\nboth syntactic analysis (e.g., part of speech tagging, dependency parsing) and\nNER of tweets. In this study, we aim to create Tweebank-NER, an NER corpus\nbased on Tweebank V2 (TB2), and we use these datasets to train state-of-the-art\nNLP models. We first annotate named entities in TB2 using Amazon Mechanical\nTurk and measure the quality of our annotations. We train a Stanza NER model on\nthe new benchmark, achieving competitive performance against other\nnon-transformer NER systems. Finally, we train other Twitter NLP models (a\ntokenizer, lemmatizer, part of speech tagger, and dependency parser) on TB2\nbased on Stanza, and achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on\nthese tasks. We release the dataset and make the models available to use in an\n\"off-the-shelf\" manner for future Tweet NLP research.

    "abstract": "Efficient anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time-series data is\nof great importance for modern industrial applications. However, building a\nsystem that is able to quickly and accurately pinpoint anomalous observations\nis a challenging problem. This is due to the lack of anomaly labels, high data\nvolatility and the demands of ultra-low inference times in modern applications.\nDespite the recent developments of deep learning approaches for anomaly\ndetection, only a few of them can address all of these challenges. In this\npaper, we propose TranAD, a deep transformer network based anomaly detection\nand diagnosis model which uses attention-based sequence encoders to swiftly\nperform inference with the knowledge of the broader temporal trends in the\ndata. TranAD uses focus score-based self-conditioning to enable robust\nmulti-modal feature extraction and adversarial training to gain stability.\nAdditionally, model-agnostic meta learning (MAML) allows us to train the model\nusing limited data. Extensive empirical studies on six publicly available\ndatasets demonstrate that TranAD can outperform state-of-the-art baseline\nmethods in detection and diagnosis performance with data and time-efficient\ntraining. Specifically, TranAD increases F1 scores by up to 17%, reducing\ntraining times by up to 99% compared to the baselines.",

In this paper, we compare different\nalgorithmic methods for holding primaries (i.e., different aggregation methods\nfor voters' ballots), by evaluating the degree of proportional ranking that is\nachieved by each of them using real-world data. In particular, we compare six\ndifferent algorithms by analyzing real-world data from a recent primary\nelection conducted by the Israeli Democratit party.

Unfortunately, embedded devices often lack processing power\nand energy required to train the ANN. The energy aspect is particularly\nchallenging when the edge device is powered only by a means of Energy\nHarvesting (EH). To overcome this problem, we propose a two-part algorithm in\nwhich the DRL process is trained at the sink.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) generally aligns the unlabeled target\ndomain data to the distribution of the source domain to mitigate the\ndistribution shift problem. The standard UDA requires sharing the source data\nwith the target, having potential data privacy leaking risks. To protect the\nsource data's privacy, we first propose to share the source feature\ndistribution instead of the source data. However, sharing only the source\nfeature distribution may still suffer from the membership inference attack who\ncan infer an individual's membership by the black-box access to the source\nmodel. To resolve this privacy issue, we further study the under-explored\nproblem of privacy-preserving domain adaptation and propose a method with a\nnovel differential privacy training strategy to protect the source data\nprivacy. We model the source feature distribution by Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMMs) under the differential privacy setting and send it to the target client\nfor adaptation. The target client resamples differentially private source\nfeatures from GMMs and adapts on target data with several state-of-art UDA\nbackbones. With our proposed method, the source data provider could avoid\nleaking source data privacy during domain adaptation as well as reserve the\nutility. To evaluate our proposed method's utility and privacy loss, we apply\nour model on a medical report disease label classification task using two noisy\nchallenging clinical text datasets.

Each profiled biological sample is thus represented by a set of\nhundreds of thousands of multidimensional cell feature vectors, which incurs a\nhigh computational cost to predict each biological sample's associated\nphenotype with machine learning models. Such a large set cardinality also\nlimits the interpretability of machine learning models due to the difficulty in\ntracking how each individual cell influences the ultimate prediction. Using\nKernel Mean Embedding to encode the cellular landscape of each profiled\nbiological sample, we can train a simple linear classifier and achieve\nstate-of-the-art classification accuracy on 3 flow and mass cytometry datasets.\nOur model contains few parameters but still performs similarly to deep learning\nmodels with millions of parameters. In contrast with deep learning approaches,\nthe linearity and sub-selection step of our model make it easy to interpret\nclassification results. Clustering analysis further shows that our method\nadmits rich biological interpretability for linking cellular heterogeneity to\nclinical phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Existing authentication solutions proposed for Internet of Things (IoT)\nprovide a single Level of Assurance (LoA) regardless of the sensitivity levels\nof the resources or interactions between IoT devices being protected. For\neffective (with adequate level of protection) and efficient (with as low\noverhead costs as possible) protections, it may be desirable to tailor the\nprotection level in response to the sensitivity level of the resources, as a\nstronger protection level typically imposes a higher level of overheads costs.\nIn this paper, we investigate how to facilitate multi-LoA authentication for\nIoT by proposing a multi-factor multi-level and interaction based (M2I)\nauthentication framework. The framework implements LoA linked and interaction\nbased authentication. Two interaction modes are investigated, P2P\n(Peer-to-Peer) and O2M (One-to-Many) via the design of two corresponding\nprotocols. Evaluation results show that adopting the O2M interaction mode in\nauthentication can cut communication cost significantly; compared with that of\nthe Kerberos protocol, the O2M protocol reduces the communication cost by 42% ~\n45%. The protocols also introduce less computational cost. The P2P and O2M\nprotocol, respectively, reduce the computational cost by 70% ~ 72% and 81% ~\n82% in comparison with that of Kerberos. Evaluation results also show that the\ntwo factor authentication option costs twice as much as that of the one-factor\noption.",

    "abstract": "The bamboo trimming problem considers $n$ bamboo with growth rates $h_1, h_2,\n\\ldots, h_n$ satisfying $\\sum_i h_i = 1$. During a given unit of time, each\nbamboo grows by $h_i$, and then the bamboo-trimming algorithm gets to trim one\nof the bamboo back down to height 0. The goal is to minimize the height of the\ntallest bamboo, also known as the backlog. The bamboo trimming problem is\nclosely related to many scheduling problems, and can be viewed as a variation\nof the widely-studied fixed-rate cup game, but with constant-factor resource\naugmentation.\nPast work has given sophisticated pinwheel algorithms that achieve the\noptimal backlog of 2 in the bamboo trimming problem. It remains an open\nquestion, however, whether there exists a \\emph{simple} algorithm with the same\nguarantee -- recent work has devoted considerable theoretical and experimental\neffort to answering this question. Two algorithms, in particular, have appeared\nas natural candidates: the \\textbf{Reduce-Max} algorithm (which always cuts the\ntallest bamboo) and the \\textbf{Reduce-Fastest}$(x)$ algorithm (which cuts the\nfastest-growing bamboo of those that have height at least $x$). Both algorithms\nare conjectured to achieve backlog 2.\nThis paper improves the bounds for both \\textbf{Reduce-Fastest} and\n\\textbf{Reduce-Max}. Among other results, we show that the \\emph{exact optimal}\nbacklog for \\textbf{Reduce-Fastest}$(x)$ is $x + 1$ for all $x \\geq 2$ and that\n\\textbf{Reduce-Fastest}$(1)$ \\emph{does not} achieve backlog 2, resolving two\nconjectures of D'Emidio, Di Stefano, and Navarra.\nFinally, we show that there is a different algorithm, which we call the\n\\textbf{Deadline-Driven} Strategy, that is both very simple and achieves the\noptimal backlog of 2. This resolves the question as to whether there exists a\nsimple worst-case optimal algorithm for the bamboo trimming problem.",

    "abstract": "The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical service that enables domain names\nto be converted to IP addresses (or vice versa); consequently, it is generally\npermitted through enterprise security systems (e.g., firewalls) with little\nrestriction.

Large organizations with loosely federated IT departments (e.g.,\nUniversities and Research Institutes) often do not even fully aware of all\ntheir DNS assets and vulnerabilities, let alone the attack surface they expose\nto the outside world. In this paper, we address the \"DNS blind spot\" by\ndeveloping methods to passively analyze live DNS traffic, identify\norganizational DNS assets, and monitor their health on a continuous basis. Our\ncontributions are threefold. First, we perform a comprehensive analysis of all\nDNS traffic in two large organizations (a University Campus and a Government\nResearch Institute) for over a month, and identify key behavioral profiles for\nvarious asset types such as recursive resolvers, authoritative name servers,\nand mixed DNS servers. Second, we develop an unsupervised clustering method\nthat classifies enterprise DNS assets using the behavioral attributes\nidentified, and demonstrate that our method successfully classifies over 100\nDNS assets across the two organizations. Third, our method continuously tracks\nvarious health metrics across the organizational DNS assets and identifies\nseveral instances of improper configuration, data exfiltration, DDoS, and\nreflection attacks. We believe the passive analysis methods in this paper can\nhelp enterprises monitor organizational DNS health in an automated and\nrisk-free manner.",

The results show that\nthe proposed model has high accuracy in identifying activities (accuracy of\n0.679) and is also effective in predicting the identity of running users.\nFurthermore, the accuracy of the human activity recognition model has\nsignificant improved by combing RunnerDNA and two motion feature indicators,\nvelocity, and acceleration. Results demonstrate that RunnerDNA is an effective\nway to describe an individual's physical activity and helps us understand\nindividual differences in sports style, and the significant differences in\nbalance and amplitude between men and women were found.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the generalized multiscale finite element method\n(GMsFEM) for single phase compressible flow in highly heterogeneous porous\nmedia. We follow the major steps of the GMsFEM to construct permeability\ndependent offline basis for fast coarse-grid simulation. The offline coarse\nspace is efficiently constructed only once based on the initial permeability\nfield with parallel computing. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed for\ntwo types of snapshot spaces. The analysis indicates that the convergence rates\nof the proposed multiscale method depend on the coarse meshsize and the\neigenvalue decay of the local spectral problem. To further increase the\naccuracy of multiscale method, residual driven online multiscale basis is added\nto the offline space. The construction of online multiscale basis is based on a\ncarefully design error indicator motivated by the analysis. We find that online\nbasis is particularly important for the singular source. Rich numerical tests\non typical 3D highly heterogeneous medias are presented to demonstrate the\nimpressive computational advantages of the proposed multiscale method.",

    "abstract": "Research on both natural intelligence (NI) and artificial intelligence (AI)\ngenerally assumes that the future resembles the past: intelligent agents or\nsystems (what we call 'intelligence') observe and act on the world, then use\nthis experience to act on future experiences of the same kind. We call this\n'retrospective learning'. For example, an intelligence may see a set of\npictures of objects, along with their names, and learn to name them. A\nretrospective learning intelligence would merely be able to name more pictures\nof the same objects. We argue that this is not what true intelligence is about.\nIn many real world problems, both NIs and AIs will have to learn for an\nuncertain future. Both must update their internal models to be useful for\nfuture tasks, such as naming fundamentally new objects and using these objects\neffectively in a new context or to achieve previously unencountered goals. This\nability to learn for the future we call 'prospective learning'. We articulate\nfour relevant factors that jointly define prospective learning. Continual\nlearning enables intelligences to remember those aspects of the past which it\nbelieves will be most useful in the future. Prospective constraints (including\nbiases and priors) facilitate the intelligence finding general solutions that\nwill be applicable to future problems. Curiosity motivates taking actions that\ninform future decision making, including in previously unmet situations. Causal\nestimation enables learning the structure of relations that guide choosing\nactions for specific outcomes, even when the specific action-outcome\ncontingencies have never been observed before. We argue that a paradigm shift\nfrom retrospective to prospective learning will enable the communities that\nstudy intelligence to unite and overcome existing bottlenecks to more\neffectively explain, augment, and engineer intelligences.",

    "abstract": "A large volume of content generated by online users is geo-tagged and this\nprovides a rich source for querying in various location-based services. An\nimportant class of queries within such services involves the association\nbetween content and locations. In this paper, we study two types of queries on\nstreaming geo-tagged data: 1) \"Top-k reverse frequent spatial queries\", where\ngiven a term, the goal is to find top K locations where the term is frequent,\nand 2) \"Term frequency spatial queries\", which is finding the expected\nfrequency of a term in a given location. To efficiently support these queries\nin a streaming setting, we model terms as events and explore a probabilistic\nmodel of geographical distribution that allows us to estimate the frequency of\nterms in locations that are not kept in a stream sketch or summary. We study\nthe back-and-forth relationship between the efficiency of queries, the\nefficiency of updates and the accuracy of the results and identify some sweet\nspots where both efficient and effective algorithms can be developed. We\ndemonstrate that our method can be extended to support multi-term queries. To\nevaluate the efficiency of our algorithms, we conduct experiments on a\nrelatively large collection of both geo-tagged tweets and geo-tagged Flickr\nphotos. The evaluation reveals that our proposed method achieves a high\naccuracy when only a limited amount of memory is given. Also the query time is\nimproved, compared to a recent baseline, by 2-3 orders of magnitude without\nmuch loss in accuracy and that the update time can further be improved by at\nleast an order of magnitude under some term distributions or update strategies.",

Since the cell-free scheme\nrequires enormous bandwidth for backhauling, we propose to use the\nsub-terahertz (sub-THz) band for the backhaul links between UAV-BSs and central\nprocessing unit (CPU). Also, because the sub-THz band requires a reliable\nline-of-sight link, we propose to use a high altitude platform station (HAPS)\nas a CPU. At the first time-slot of the proposed scheme, users send their\nmessages to UAVs at the sub-6 GHz band. The UAVs then apply match-filtering and\npower allocation. At the second time-slot, at each UAV, orthogonal resource\nblocks are allocated for each user at the sub-THz band, and the signals are\nsent to the HAPS after analog beamforming. In the HAPS receiver, after analog\nbeamforming, the message of each user is decoded. We formulate an optimization\nproblem that maximizes the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of\nusers by finding the optimum allocated power as well as the optimum locations\nof UAVs.

    "abstract": "Neural code models have introduced significant improvements over many\nsoftware analysis tasks like type inference, vulnerability detection, etc.\nDespite the good performance of such models under the common intra-project\nindependent and identically distributed (IID) training and validation setting,\nwe observe that they usually fail to generalize to real-world inter-project\nout-of-distribution (OOD) setting. In this work, we show that such phenomenon\nis caused by model heavily relying on project-specific, ungeneralizable tokens\nlike self-defined variable and function names for downstream prediction, and we\nformulate it as the project-specific bias learning behavior. We propose a\nmeasurement to interpret such behavior, termed as Cond-Idf, which combines\nco-occurrence probability and inverse document frequency to measure the level\nof relatedness of token with label and its project-specificness. The\napproximation indicates that without proper regularization with prior\nknowledge, model tends to leverage spurious statistical cues for prediction.\nEquipped with these observations, we propose a bias mitigation mechanism Batch\nPartition Regularization (BPR) that regularizes model to infer based on proper\nbehavior by leveraging latent logic relations among samples. Experimental\nresults on two deep code benchmarks indicate that BPR can improve both\ninter-project OOD generalization and adversarial robustness while not\nsacrificing accuracy on IID data.",

This challenge is referred as model flexibility. And so, with\nthis in minds, the online deep learning model we need to design should have a\nvariable underlying structure; (3) moreover, it is of utmost importance to\nfusion these abstract hierarchical latent representations to achieve better\nclassification performance, and we should give different weights to different\nlevels of implicit representation information when dealing with the data\nstreaming where the data distribution changes. To address these issues, we\npropose a two-phase Online Deep Learning based on Auto-Encoder (ODLAE). Based\non auto-encoder, considering reconstruction loss, we extract abstract\nhierarchical latent representations of instances; Based on predictive loss, we\ndevise two fusion strategies: the output-level fusion strategy, which is\nobtained by fusing the classification results of encoder each hidden layer; and\nfeature-level fusion strategy, which is leveraged self-attention mechanism to\nfusion every hidden layer output. Finally, in order to improve the robustness\nof the algorithm, we also try to utilize the denoising auto-encoder to yield\nhierarchical latent representations.

Its wireless streaming is an instance of general\nmulticast, extending conventional unicast and multicast, whose effective design\nis still open. This paper investigates general rate splitting for general\nmulticast. Specifically, we consider a multi-carrier single-cell wireless\nnetwork where a multi-antenna base station (BS) communicates to multiple\nsingle-antenna users via general multicast. We consider linear beamforming at\nthe BS and joint decoding at each user in the slow fading and fast fading\nscenarios. In the slow fading scenario, we consider the maximization of the\nweighted sum average rate, which is a challenging nonconvex stochastic problem\nwith numerous variables. To reduce computational complexity, we decouple the\noriginal nonconvex stochastic problem into multiple nonconvex deterministic\nproblems, one for each system channel state. Then, we propose an iterative\nalgorithm for each deterministic problem to obtain a KKT point using the\nconcave-convex procedure (CCCP). In the fast fading scenario, we consider the\nmaximization of the weighted sum ergodic rate. This problem is more challenging\nthan the one for the slow fading scenario, as it is not separable. First, we\npropose a stochastic iterative algorithm to obtain a KKT point using stochastic\nsuccessive convex approximation (SSCA) and the exact penalty method. Then, we\npropose two low-complexity iterative algorithms to obtain feasible points with\npromising performance for two cases of channel distributions using\napproximation and CCCP.

    "abstract": "Feature learning is a widely used method employed for large-scale face\nrecognition. Recently, large-margin softmax loss methods have demonstrated\nsignificant enhancements on deep face recognition. These methods propose fixed\npositive margins in order to enforce intra-class compactness and inter-class\ndiversity. However, the majority of the proposed methods do not consider the\nclass imbalance issue, which is a major challenge in practice for developing\ndeep face recognition models. We hypothesize that it significantly affects the\ngeneralization ability of the deep face models. Inspired by this observation,\nwe introduce a novel adaptive strategy, called KappaFace, to modulate the\nrelative importance based on class difficultness and imbalance. With the\nsupport of the von Mises-Fisher distribution, our proposed KappaFace loss can\nintensify the margin's magnitude for hard learning or low concentration classes\nwhile relaxing it for counter classes. Experiments conducted on popular facial\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance\nto the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Understanding deep learning is increasingly emergent as it penetrates more\nand more into industry and science. In recent years, a research line from\nFourier analysis sheds lights into this magical \"black box\" by showing a\nFrequency Principle (F-Principle or spectral bias) of the training behavior of\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) -- DNNs often fit functions from low to high\nfrequency during the training. The F-Principle is first demonstrated by\none-dimensional synthetic data followed by the verification in high-dimensional\nreal datasets. A series of works subsequently enhance the validity of the\nF-Principle. This low-frequency implicit bias reveals the strength of neural\nnetwork in learning low-frequency functions as well as its deficiency in\nlearning high-frequency functions. Such understanding inspires the design of\nDNN-based algorithms in practical problems, explains experimental phenomena\nemerging in various scenarios, and further advances the study of deep learning\nfrom the frequency perspective. Although incomplete, we provide an overview of\nF-Principle and propose some open problems for future research.",

However, the\nmutual interference in the communication radar coexistence system cannot be\nignored. Inspired by the studies of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS),\nwe propose a double-RIS-assisted coexistence system where two RISs are deployed\nfor enhancing communication signals and suppressing mutual interference. We aim\nto jointly optimize the beamforming of RISs and radar to maximize communication\nperformance while maintaining radar detection performance. The investigated\nproblem is challenging, and thus we transform it into an equivalent but more\ntractable form by introducing auxiliary variables. Then, we propose a penalty\ndual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm to solve the resultant problem.\nMoreover, we consider two special cases: the large radar transmit power\nscenario and the low radar transmit power scenario. For the former, we prove\nthat the beamforming design is only determined by the communication channel and\nthe corresponding optimal joint beamforming strategy can be obtained in\nclosed-form. For the latter, we minimize the mutual interference via the block\ncoordinate descent (BCD) method. By combining the solutions of these two cases,\na low-complexity algorithm is also developed.

Graph contrastive learning is one of the unsupervised graph\nrepresentation learning methods, which recently attracts attention from\nresearchers and has achieved state-of-the-art performances on various tasks.\nThe key to the success of graph contrastive learning is to construct proper\ncontrasting pairs to acquire the underlying structural semantics of the graph.\nHowever, this key part is not fully explored currently, most of the ways\ngenerating contrasting pairs focus on augmenting or perturbating graph\nstructures to obtain different views of the input graph. But such strategies\ncould degrade the performances via adding noise into the graph, which may\nnarrow down the field of the applications of graph contrastive learning. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning method, namely\n\\textbf{D}ual \\textbf{S}pace \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{C}ontrastive (DSGC)\nLearning, to conduct graph contrastive learning among views generated in\ndifferent spaces including the hyperbolic space and the Euclidean space. Since\nboth spaces have their own advantages to represent graph data in the embedding\nspaces, we hope to utilize graph contrastive learning to bridge the spaces and\nleverage advantages from both sides. The comparison experiment results show\nthat DSGC achieves competitive or better performances among all the datasets.\nIn addition, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impact of\ndifferent graph encoders on DSGC, giving insights about how to better leverage\nthe advantages of contrastive learning between different spaces.",

While envy-free allocations of indivisible goods are not guaranteed to\nexist, envy-freeness can be achieved by additionally providing some subsidy to\nthe agents.

In this setup, we bound the subsidy required to attain envy-freeness\namong agents with dichotomous valuations, i.e., among agents whose marginal\nvalue for any good is either zero or one.\nWe prove that, under dichotomous valuations, there exists an allocation that\nachieves envy-freeness with a per-agent subsidy of either $0$ or $1$.\nFurthermore, such an envy-free solution can be computed efficiently in the\nstandard value-oracle model.

Currently, several approaches have\nbeen proposed for binary-source code matching by jointly learning the\nembeddings of binary code and source code in a common vector space. Despite\nmuch effort, existing approaches target on matching the binary code and source\ncode written in a single programming language.

Matching binary and source code\nacross programming languages introduces additional challenges when maintaining\nmulti-language and multi-platform applications.

    "abstract": "A large number of coils are able to provide enhanced signal-to-noise ratio\nand improve imaging performance in parallel imaging. As the increasingly grow\nof coil number, however, it simultaneously aggravates the drawbacks of data\nstorage and reconstruction speed, especially in some iterative reconstructions.\nCoil compression addresses these issues by generating fewer virtual coils. In\nthis work, a novel variable augmented network for invertible coil compression\n(VAN-ICC) is presented, which utilizes inherent reversibility of\nnormalizing-flow-based models, for better compression and invertible recovery.\nVAN-ICC trains invertible network by finding an invertible and bijective\nfunction, which can map the original image to the compression image. In the\nexperiments, both fully-sampled images and under-sampled images were used to\nverify the effectiveness of the model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations demonstrated that, in comparison with SCC and GCC, VAN-ICC can\ncarry through better compression effect with equal number of virtual coils.\nAdditionally, its performance is not susceptible to different num-ber of\nvirtual coils.",

    "abstract": "The importance of workflows is highlighted by the fact that they have\nunderpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past decades. Many\nof these workflows have significant computational, storage, and communication\ndemands, and thus must execute on a range of large-scale computer systems, from\nlocal clusters to public clouds and upcoming exascale HPC platforms.\nHistorically, infrastructures for workflow execution consisted of complex,\nintegrated systems, developed in-house by workflow practitioners with strong\ndependencies on a range of legacy technologies. Due to the increasing need to\nsupport workflows, dedicated workflow systems were developed to provide\nabstractions for creating, executing, and adapting workflows conveniently and\nefficiently while ensuring portability. While these efforts are all worthwhile\nindividually, there are now hundreds of independent workflow systems. The\nresulting workflow system technology landscape is fragmented, which may present\nsignificant barriers for future workflow users due to many seemingly\ncomparable, yet usually mutually incompatible, systems that exist. In order to\ntackle some of these challenges, the DOE-funded ExaWorks and NSF-funded\nWorkflowsRI projects have organized in 2021 a series of events entitled the\n\"Workflows Community Summit\". The third edition of the ``Workflows Community\nSummit\" explored workflows challenges and opportunities from the perspective of\ncomputing centers and facilities. The third summit brought together a small\ngroup of facilities representatives with the aim to understand how workflows\nare currently being used at each facility, how facilities would like to\ninteract with workflow developers and users, how workflows fit with facility\nroadmaps, and what opportunities there are for tighter integration between\nfacilities and workflows.

Furthermore, we improve the depth-specific\naugmentation method by utilizing an important observation in depth estimation\nto enhance the model. Our network achieves state-of-the-art performance over\nthe challenging depth dataset NYU Depth V2.

    "abstract": "Deep image steganography is a data hiding technology that conceal data in\ndigital images via deep neural networks. However, existing deep image\nsteganography methods only consider the visual similarity of container images\nto host images, and neglect the statistical security (stealthiness) of\ncontainer images. Besides, they usually hides data limited to image type and\nthus relax the constraint of lossless extraction. In this paper, we address the\nabove issues in a unified manner, and propose deep image steganography that can\nembed data with arbitrary types into images for secure data hiding and lossless\ndata revealing. First, we formulate the data hiding as an image colorization\nproblem, in which the data is binarized and further mapped into the color\ninformation for a gray-scale host image. Second, we design a conditional\ninvertible neural network which uses gray-scale image as prior to guide the\ncolor generation and perform data hiding in a secure way. Finally, to achieve\nlossless data revealing, we present a multi-stage training scheme to manage the\ndata loss due to rounding errors between hiding and revealing processes.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can perform secure\ndata hiding by generating realism color images and successfully resisting the\ndetection of steganalysis. Moreover, we can achieve 100% revealing accuracy in\ndifferent scenarios, indicating the practical utility of our steganography in\nthe real-world.",

Due to insufficient task-specific training data and corresponding ground\ntruth, most existing end-to-end image fusion methods easily fall into\noverfitting or tedious parameter optimization processes. Two-stage methods\navoid the need of large amount of task-specific training data by training\nencoder-decoder network on large natural image datasets and utilizing the\nextracted features for fusion, but the domain gap between natural images and\ndifferent fusion tasks results in limited performance.

In order to encourage different fusion tasks to\npromote each other and increase the generalizability of the trained network, we\nintegrate the three self-supervised auxiliary tasks by randomly choosing one of\nthem to destroy a natural image in model training.

Learning\nwhen to communicate, i.e. sparse communication, is particularly important where\nbandwidth is limited, in situations where agents interact with humans, in\npartially observable scenarios where agents must convey information unavailable\nto others, and in non-cooperative scenarios where agents may hide information\nto gain a competitive advantage. Recent work in learning sparse communication,\nhowever, suffers from high variance training where, the price of decreasing\ncommunication is a decrease in reward, particularly in cooperative tasks.\nSparse communications are necessary to match agent communication to limited\nhuman bandwidth. Humans additionally communicate via discrete linguistic\ntokens, previously shown to decrease task performance when compared to\ncontinuous communication vectors. This research addresses the above issues by\nlimiting the loss in reward of decreasing communication and eliminating the\npenalty for discretization. In this work, we successfully constrain training\nusing a learned gate to regulate when to communicate while using discrete\nprototypes that reflect what to communicate for cooperative tasks with partial\nobservability.

    "title": "Detecting Stance in Tweets : A Signed Network based Approach",
    "abstract": "Identifying user stance related to a political event has several\napplications, like determination of individual stance, shaping of public\nopinion, identifying popularity of government measures and many others. The\nhuge volume of political discussions on social media platforms, like, Twitter,\nprovide opportunities in developing automated mechanisms to identify individual\nstance and subsequently, scale to a large volume of users. However, issues like\nshort text and huge variance in the vocabulary of the tweets make such exercise\nenormously difficult. Existing stance detection algorithms require either event\nspecific training data or annotated twitter handles and therefore, are\ndifficult to adapt to new events. In this paper, we propose a sign network\nbased framework that use external information sources, like news articles to\ncreate a signed network of relevant entities with respect to a news event and\nsubsequently use the same to detect stance of any tweet towards the event.\nValidation on 5,000 tweets related to 10 events indicates that the proposed\napproach can ensure over 6.5% increase in average F1 score compared to the\nexisting stance detection approaches.",

    "title": "Tensor Ranks for the Pedestrian for Dimension Reduction and  Disentangling Interactions",
    "abstract": "A tensor is a multi-way array that can represent, in addition to a data set,\nthe expression of a joint law or a multivariate function. As such it contains\nthe description of the interactions between the variables corresponding to each\nof the entries. The rank of a tensor extends to arrays with more than two\nentries the notion of rank of a matrix, bearing in mind that there are several\napproaches to build such an extension. When the rank is one, the variables are\nseparated, and when it is low, the variables are weakly coupled. Many\ncalculations are simpler on tensors of low rank. Furthermore, approximating a\ngiven tensor by a low-rank tensor makes it possible to compute some\ncharacteristics of a table, such as the partition function when it is a joint\nlaw. In this note, we present in detail an integrated and progressive approach\nto approximate a given tensor by a tensor of lower rank, through a systematic\nuse of tensor algebra. The notion of tensor is rigorously defined, then\nelementary but useful operations on tensors are presented. After recalling\nseveral different notions for extending the rank to tensors, we show how these\nelementary operations can be combined to build best low rank approximation\nalgorithms. The last chapter is devoted to applying this approach to tensors\nconstructed as the discretisation of a multivariate function, to show that on a\nCartesian grid, the rank of such tensors is expected to be low.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, neural signed distance function (SDF) has become one of the\nmost effectiverepresentation methods for 3D models. By learning continuous SDFs\nin 3D space, neuralnetworks can predict the distance from a given query space\npoint to its closest object surface,whose positive and negative signs denote\ninside and outside of the object, respectively.Training a specific network for\neach 3D model, which individually embeds its shape, canrealize compressed\nrepresentation of objects by storing fewer network (and possibly\nlatent)parameters. Consequently, reconstruction through network inference and\nsurface recoverycan be achieved. In this paper, we propose an SDF prediction\nnetwork using explicit keyspheres as input. Key spheres are extracted from the\ninternal space of objects, whosecenters either have relatively larger SDF\nvalues (sphere radii), or are located at essentialpositions. By inputting the\nspatial information of multiple spheres which imply differentlocal shapes, the\nproposed method can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracywith a\nnegligible storage cost. Compared to previous works, our method achieves the\nhigh-fidelity and high-compression 3D object coding and reconstruction.\nExperiments conductedon three datasets verify the superior performance of our\nmethod.",

    "abstract": "High-dimensional signal recovery of standard linear regression is a key\nchallenge in many engineering fields, such as, communications, compressed\nsensing, and image processing. The approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm\nproposed by Donoho \\textit{et al} is a computational efficient method to such\nproblems, which can attain Bayes-optimal performance in independent identical\ndistributed (IID) sub-Gaussian random matrices region. A significant feature of\nAMP is that the dynamical behavior of AMP can be fully predicted by a scalar\nequation termed station evolution (SE). Although AMP is optimal in IID\nsub-Gaussian random matrices, AMP may fail to converge when measurement matrix\nis beyond IID sub-Gaussian. To extend the region of random measurement matrix,\nan expectation propagation (EP)-related algorithm orthogonal AMP (OAMP) was\nproposed, which shares the same algorithm with EP, expectation consistent (EC),\nand vector AMP (VAMP). This paper aims at giving a review for those algorithms.\nWe begin with the worst case, i.e. least absolute shrinkage and selection\noperator (LASSO) inference problem, and then give the detailed derivation of\nAMP derived from message passing. Also, in the Bayes-optimal setting, we give\nthe Bayes-optimal AMP which has a slight difference from AMP for LASSO.

The focus is on the case where the agents have possibly repeated\nunstable eigenvalues since those with stable eigenvalues are well-known. It\nproposes the use of a generalized gain matrix and shows that under reasonable\nconditions, synchronization/consensus is achieved when the gain is sufficiently\nlarge. When the communication network is non time-varying and the dynamics of\nthe agent have eigenvalues in the closed left-half complex plane, the proposed\napproach includes the standard consensus result. Several connections to\nstandard results are also highlighted. The existences of such gain matrices for\nconsensus are shown under three communication settings: fixed graph, switching\namong undirected and connected graphs and switching among directed and\nconnected graphs. An adaptive scheme to realize the gain matrix for the case of\nundirected and fixed network is also shown and illustrated via an example.",

    "abstract": "In the process of Systematic Literature Review, citation screening is\nestimated to be one of the most time-consuming steps. Multiple approaches to\nautomate it using various machine learning techniques have been proposed. The\nfirst research papers that apply deep neural networks to this problem were\npublished in the last two years. In this work, we conduct a replicability study\nof the first two deep learning papers for citation screening and evaluate their\nperformance on 23 publicly available datasets. While we succeeded in\nreplicating the results of one of the papers, we were unable to replicate the\nresults of the other. We summarise the challenges involved in the replication,\nincluding difficulties in obtaining the datasets to match the experimental\nsetup of the original papers and problems with executing the original source\ncode. Motivated by this experience, we subsequently present a simpler model\nbased on averaging word embeddings that outperforms one of the models on 18 out\nof 23 datasets and is, on average, 72 times faster than the second replicated\napproach. Finally, we measure the training time and the invariance of the\nmodels when exposed to a variety of input features and random initialisations,\ndemonstrating differences in the robustness of these approaches.",

    "abstract": "Since their announcement in November 2020, COVID-19 vaccines were largely\ndebated by the press and social media. With most studies focusing on COVID-19\ndisinformation in social media, little attention has been paid to how\nmainstream news outlets framed COVID-19 narratives compared to alternative\nsources. To fill this gap, we use cognitive network science and natural\nlanguage processing to reconstruct time-evolving semantic and emotional frames\nof 5745 Italian news, that were massively re-shared on Facebook and Twitter,\nabout COVID-19 vaccines. We found consistently high levels of\ntrust/anticipation and less disgust in the way mainstream sources framed the\ngeneral idea of \"vaccine/vaccino\". These emotions were crucially missing in the\nways alternative sources framed COVID-19 vaccines. More differences were found\nwithin specific instances of vaccines. Alternative news included titles framing\nthe AstraZeneca vaccine with strong levels of sadness, absent in mainstream\ntitles. Mainstream news initially framed \"Pfizer\" along more negative\nassociations with side effects than \"AstraZeneca\". With the temporary\nsuspension of the latter, on March 15th 2021, we identified a\nsemantic/emotional shift: Even mainstream article titles framed \"AstraZeneca\"\nas semantically richer in negative associations with side effects, while\n\"Pfizer\" underwent a positive shift in valence, mostly related to its higher\nefficacy. \"Thrombosis\" entered the frame of vaccines together with fearful\nconceptual associations, while \"death\" underwent an emotional shift, steering\ntowards fear in alternative titles and losing its hopeful connotation in\nmainstream titles. Our findings expose crucial aspects of the emotional\nnarratives around COVID-19 vaccines adopted by the press, highlighting the need\nto understand how alternative and mainstream media report vaccination news.",

In this article,\nwe propose a method of using artificial intelligence to expand the channel to\nachieve the effect of increasing the virtual coil. The main feature of our work\nis utilizing dummy variable technology to expand the channel in both the image\nand k-space domains. The high-dimensional information formed by channel\nexpansion is used as the prior information of parallel imaging to improve the\nreconstruction effect of parallel imaging. Two features are introduced, namely\nvariable enhancement and sum of squares (SOS) objective function. Variable\nargumentation provides the network with more high-dimensional prior\ninformation, which is helpful for the network to extract the deep feature\nin-formation of the image. The SOS objective function is employed to solve the\nproblem that k-space data is difficult to train while speeding up the\nconvergence speed.

    "abstract": "Participatory budgeting (PB) is a democratic process for allocating funds to\nprojects based on the votes of members of the community. Different rules have\nbeen used to aggregate participants' votes. Past research has studied the\ntrade-off between notions of social welfare and fairness in the multi-winner\nsetting (a special case of participatory budgeting with identical project\ncosts) by Lackner and Skowron (2020). But there is little understanding of this\ntrade-off in the more general PB setting. This paper provides a theoretical and\nempirical study of the worst-case guarantees of several common rules to better\nunderstand the trade-off between social welfare, representation. We show that\nmany of the guarantees from the multi-winner setting do not generalize to the\nPB setting, and that the introduction of costs leads to substantially worse\nguarantees, thereby exacerbating the welfare-representation trade-off. We\nextend our theoretical analysis to studying how the requirement of\nproportionality over voting rules affects this trade-off. We further study how\nthe requirement of proportionality over voting rules effects the guarantees on\nsocial welfare and representation. We study the latter point also empirically,\nboth on real and synthetic datasets. We show that variants of the recently\nsuggested voting rule Rule-X (which satisfies proportionality) do very well in\npractice both with respect to social welfare and representation.",

However, available data\nabout new users is often insufficient, leading to inaccurate recommendations;\nan issue that is known as the cold-start problem. A solution can be active\nlearning. Active learning strategies proactively select items and ask users to\nrate these. This way, detailed user preferences can be acquired and as a\nresult, more accurate recommendations can be offered to the user. In this\nstudy, we compare five active learning algorithms, combined with three\ndifferent predictor algorithms, which are used to estimate to what extent the\nuser would like the item that is asked to rate. In addition, two modes are\ntested for selecting the items: batch mode (all items at once), and sequential\nmode (the items one by one). Evaluation of the recommender in terms of rating\nprediction, decision support, and the ranking of items, showed that sequential\nmode produces the most accurate recommendations for dense data sets.\nDifferences between the active learning algorithms are small. For most active\nlearners, the best predictor turned out to be FunkSVD in combination with\nsequential mode.",

In a first class, propagation is modeled as a wave\nwhich emanates from a set of known nodes at an initial time, to all other\nunknown nodes at later times with an ordering determined by the time at which\nthe information wave front reaches nodes. A second class of models is based on\nthe notion of a travel time along paths between nodes. The time of information\npropagation from an initial known set of nodes to a node is defined as the\nminimum of a generalized travel time over subsets of all admissible paths. A\nfinal class is given by imposing a local equation of an eikonal form at each\nunknown node, with boundary conditions at the known nodes. The solution value\nof the local equation at a node is coupled the neighbouring nodes with smaller\nsolution values. We provide precise formulations of the model classes in this\ngraph setting, and prove equivalences between them. Motivated by the connection\nbetween first arrival time model and the eikonal equation in the continuum\nsetting, we demonstrate that for graphs in the particular form of grids in\nEuclidean space mean field limits under grid refinement of certain graph models\nlead to Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, yoga has become a part of life for many people. Exercises and\nsports technological assistance is implemented in yoga pose identification. In\nthis work, a self-assistance based yoga posture identification technique is\ndeveloped, which helps users to perform Yoga with the correction feature in\nReal-time. The work also presents Yoga-hand mudra (hand gestures)\nidentification. The YOGI dataset has been developed which include 10 Yoga\npostures with around 400-900 images of each pose and also contain 5 mudras for\nidentification of mudras postures. It contains around 500 images of each mudra.\nThe feature has been extracted by making a skeleton on the body for yoga poses\nand hand for mudra poses. Two different algorithms have been used for creating\na skeleton one for yoga poses and the second for hand mudras. Angles of the\njoints have been extracted as a features for different machine learning and\ndeep learning models. among all the models XGBoost with RandomSearch CV is most\naccurate and gives 99.2\\% accuracy.

    "abstract": "The core issue of cyberspace detecting and mapping is to accurately identify\nand dynamically track devices. However, with the development of anonymization\ntechnology, devices can have multiple IP addresses and MAC addresses, and it is\ndifficult to map multiple virtual attributes to the same physical device by\nexisting detecting and mapping technologies. In this paper, we propose a\ndetailed PUF-based detecting and mapping framework which can actively detect\nphysical resources in cyberspace, construct resource portraits based on\nphysical fingerprints, and dynamically track devices. We present a new method\nto implement a rowhammer DRAM PUF on a general PC equipped with DDR4 memory.\nThe PUF performance evaluation shows that the extracted rowhammer PUF response\nis unique and reliable on PC, which can be treated as the device's unique\nphysical fingerprint. The results of detecting and mapping experiments show\nthat the framework we proposed can accurately identify the target devices. Even\nif the device modifies its MAC address, IP address, and operating system, by\nconstructing a physical fingerprint database for device matching, the\nidentification accuracy is close to the ideal value of 100%.",

    "abstract": "Communication overhead is one of the major obstacles to train large deep\nlearning models at scale. Gradient sparsification is a promising technique to\nreduce the communication volume. However, it is very challenging to obtain real\nperformance improvement because of (1) the difficulty of achieving an scalable\nand efficient sparse allreduce algorithm and (2) the sparsification overhead.\nThis paper proposes O$k$-Top$k$, a scheme for distributed training with sparse\ngradients. O$k$-Top$k$ integrates a novel sparse allreduce algorithm (less than\n6$k$ communication volume which is asymptotically optimal) with the\ndecentralized parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer, and its\nconvergence is proved. To reduce the sparsification overhead, O$k$-Top$k$\nefficiently selects the top-$k$ gradient values according to an estimated\nthreshold. Evaluations are conducted on the Piz Daint supercomputer with neural\nnetwork models from different deep learning domains. Empirical results show\nthat O$k$-Top$k$ achieves similar model accuracy to dense allreduce. Compared\nwith the optimized dense and the state-of-the-art sparse allreduces,\nO$k$-Top$k$ is more scalable and significantly improves training throughput\n(e.g., 3.29x-12.95x improvement for BERT on 256 GPUs).",

    "abstract": "In order to improve the vessel's capacity and ensure maritime traffic safety,\nvessel intelligent trajectory prediction plays an essential role in the\nvessel's smart navigation and intelligent collision avoidance system. However,\ncurrent researchers only focus on short-term or long-term vessel trajectory\nprediction, which leads to insufficient accuracy of trajectory prediction and\nlack of in-depth mining of comprehensive historical trajectory data. This paper\nproposes an Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) method based on the fusion of the forward sub-network and the\nreverse sub-network (termed as FRA-LSTM) to predict the vessel trajectory. The\nforward sub-network in our method combines LSTM and attention mechanism to mine\nfeatures of forward historical trajectory data. Simultaneously, the reverse\nsub-network combines bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) and attention mechanism to\nmine features of backward historical trajectory data. Finally, the final\npredicted trajectory is generated by fusing output features of the forward and\nreverse sub-network. Based on plenty of experiments, we prove that the accuracy\nof our proposed method in predicting short-term and mid-term trajectories has\nincreased by 96.8% and 86.5% on average compared with the BiLSTM and Seq2seq.\nFurthermore, the average accuracy of our method is 90.1% higher than that of\ncompared the BiLSTM and Seq2seq in predicting long-term trajectories.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a deep multi-view stereo (MVS) system that\njointly predicts depths, surface normals and per-view confidence maps. The key\nto our approach is a novel solver that iteratively solves for per-view depth\nmap and normal map by optimizing an energy potential based on the locally\nplanar assumption. Specifically, the algorithm updates depth map by propagating\nfrom neighboring pixels with slanted planes, and updates normal map with local\nprobabilistic plane fitting. Both two steps are monitored by a customized\nconfidence map. This solver is not only effective as a post-processing tool for\nplane-based depth refinement and completion, but also differentiable such that\nit can be efficiently integrated into deep learning pipelines. Our multi-view\nstereo system employs multiple optimization steps of the solver over the\ninitial prediction of depths and surface normals. The whole system can be\ntrained end-to-end, decoupling the challenging problem of matching pixels\nwithin poorly textured regions from the cost-volume based neural network.\nExperimental results on ScanNet and RGB-D Scenes V2 demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance of the proposed deep MVS system on multi-view\ndepth estimation, with our proposed solver consistently improving the depth\nquality over both conventional and deep learning based MVS pipelines.

    "abstract": "Policy makers often make decisions based on parameters such as GDP,\nunemployment rate, industrial output, etc. The primary methods to obtain or\neven estimate such information are resource intensive and time consuming. In\norder to make timely and well-informed decisions, it is imperative to be able\nto come up with proxies for these parameters which can be sampled quickly and\nefficiently, especially during disruptive events, like the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRecently, there has been a lot of focus on using remote sensing data for this\npurpose. The data has become cheaper to collect compared to surveys, and can be\navailable in real time. In this work, we present Regional GDP NightLight\n(ReGNL), a neural network based model which is trained on a custom dataset of\nhistorical nightlights and GDP data along with the geographical coordinates of\na place, and estimates the GDP of the place, given the other parameters. Taking\nthe case of 50 US states, we find that ReGNL is disruption-agnostic and is able\nto predict the GDP for both normal years (2019) and for years with a disruptive\nevent (2020). ReGNL outperforms timeseries ARIMA methods for prediction, even\nduring the pandemic.

Among the quantization methods,\nBinary and Ternary Weight Networks (BWNs and TWNs) have a unique advantage over\n8-bit and 4-bit quantization. They replace the multiplication operations in\nCNNs with additions, which are favoured on In-Memory-Computing (IMC) devices.\nIMC acceleration for BWNs has been widely studied. However, though TWNs have\nhigher accuracy and better sparsity, IMC acceleration for TWNs has limited\nresearch. TWNs on existing IMC devices are inefficient because the sparsity is\nnot well utilized, and the addition operation is not efficient.\nIn this paper, we propose FAT as a novel IMC accelerator for TWNs. First, we\npropose a Sparse Addition Control Unit, which utilizes the sparsity of TWNs to\nskip the null operations on zero weights. Second, we propose a fast addition\nscheme based on the memory Sense Amplifier to avoid the time overhead of both\ncarry propagation and writing back the carry to the memory cells. Third, we\nfurther propose a Combined-Stationary data mapping to reduce the data movement\nof both activations and weights and increase the parallelism of memory columns.\nSimulation results show that for addition operations at the Sense Amplifier\nlevel, FAT achieves 2.00X speedup, 1.22X power efficiency and 1.22X area\nefficiency compared with State-Of-The-Art IMC accelerator ParaPIM.

As a solution,\nthis paper first clarifies important terms and concepts for the\ninterdisciplinary domain of AI methods in product design. A key contribution of\nthis paper is a new classification of design problems using the four\ncharacteristics decomposability, inter-dependencies, innovation and creativity.\nDefinitions of these concepts are given where they are lacking. Early mappings\nof these concepts to AI solutions are sketched and verified using design\nexamples. The importance of creativity in product design and a corresponding\ngap in AI is pointed out for future research.",

    "abstract": "In biomedical image analysis, the applicability of deep learning methods is\ndirectly impacted by the quantity of image data available. This is due to deep\nlearning models requiring large image datasets to provide high-level\nperformance. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely utilized\nto address data limitations through the generation of synthetic biomedical\nimages. GANs consist of two models. The generator, a model that learns how to\nproduce synthetic images based on the feedback it receives. The discriminator,\na model that classifies an image as synthetic or real and provides feedback to\nthe generator. Throughout the training process, a GAN can experience several\ntechnical challenges that impede the generation of suitable synthetic imagery.\nFirst, the mode collapse problem whereby the generator either produces an\nidentical image or produces a uniform image from distinct input features.\nSecond, the non-convergence problem whereby the gradient descent optimizer\nfails to reach a Nash equilibrium. Thirdly, the vanishing gradient problem\nwhereby unstable training behavior occurs due to the discriminator achieving\noptimal classification performance resulting in no meaningful feedback being\nprovided to the generator. These problems result in the production of synthetic\nimagery that is blurry, unrealistic, and less diverse. To date, there has been\nno survey article outlining the impact of these technical challenges in the\ncontext of the biomedical imagery domain. This work presents a review and\ntaxonomy based on solutions to the training problems of GANs in the biomedical\nimaging domain. This survey highlights important challenges and outlines future\nresearch directions about the training of GANs in the domain of biomedical\nimagery.",

    "abstract": "Network and system security are incredibly critical issues now. Due to the\nrapid proliferation of malware, traditional analysis methods struggle with\nenormous samples.\nIn this paper, we propose four easy-to-extract and small-scale features,\nincluding sizes and permissions of Windows PE sections, content complexity, and\nimport libraries, to classify malware families, and use automatic machine\nlearning to search for the best model and hyper-parameters for each feature and\ntheir combinations. Compared with detailed behavior-related features like API\nsequences, proposed features provide macroscopic information about malware. The\nanalysis is based on static disassembly scripts and hexadecimal machine code.\nUnlike dynamic behavior analysis, static analysis is resource-efficient and\noffers complete code coverage, but is vulnerable to code obfuscation and\nencryption.\nThe results demonstrate that features which work well in dynamic analysis are\nnot necessarily effective when applied to static analysis. For instance, API\n4-grams only achieve 57.96% accuracy and involve a relatively high dimensional\nfeature set (5000 dimensions). In contrast, the novel proposed features\ntogether with a classical machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) presents\nvery good accuracy at 99.40% and the feature vector is of much smaller\ndimension (40 dimensions). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach\nthrough integration in IDA Pro, which also facilitates the collection of new\ntraining samples and subsequent model retraining.",

Dated detection techniques such as Anti-Virus Software (AVS) based\non signature-based methods could no longer keep up with the demand that\ncomputer systems required of them. The complexity of modern malware has led to\nthe development of contemporary detection techniques that use the machine\nlearning field and hardware to boost the detection rates of malicious software.\nThese new techniques use Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) that form a\ndigital signature of sorts. After the models are fed training data, they can\nreference these HPCs to classify zero-day malware samples. A problem emerges\nwhen malware with no comparable HPC values comes into contact with these new\ntechniques. We provide an analysis of several machine learning and deep\nlearning models that run zero-day samples and evaluate the results from the\nconversion of C++ algorithms to a hardware description language (HDL) used to\nbegin a hardware implementation. Our results present a lack of accuracy from\nthe models when running zero-day malware data as our highest detector, decision\ntree, was only able to reach 91.2% accuracy and had an F1-Score of 91.5% in the\nform of a decision tree. Next, through the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) and\narea-under-the-curve (AUC), we can also determine that the algorithms did not\npresent significant robustness as the largest AUC was only 0.819. In addition,\nwe viewed relatively high overhead for our ensemble learning algorithm while\nalso only having an 86.3% accuracy and 86% F1-Score. Finally, as an additional\ntask, we adapted the one rule algorithm to fit many rules to make malware\nclassification understandable to everyday users by allowing them to view the\nregulations while maintaining relatively high accuracy.",

We report on our efforts to\nconstruct mixed recognition models which can be applied out-of-the-box without\nany further document-specific training but also serve as a starting point for\nfinetuning by training a new model on a few pages of transcribed text (ground\ntruth). To train the mixed models we collected a corpus of 35 manuscripts and\nca. 12.5k text lines for two widely used handwriting styles, Gothic and\nBastarda cursives. Evaluating the mixed models out-of-the-box on four unseen\nmanuscripts resulted in an average Character Error Rate (CER) of 6.22%. After\ntraining on 2, 4 and eventually 32 pages the CER dropped to 3.27%, 2.58%, and\n1.65%, respectively. While the in-domain recognition and training of models\n(Bastarda model to Bastarda material, Gothic to Gothic) unsurprisingly yielded\nthe best results, finetuning out-of-domain models to unseen scripts was still\nshown to be superior to training from scratch.\nOur new mixed models have been made openly available to the community.",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty-aware semantic segmentation of the point clouds includes the\npredictive uncertainty estimation and the uncertainty-guided model\noptimization. One key challenge in the task is the efficiency of point-wise\npredictive distribution establishment. The widely-used MC dropout establishes\nthe distribution by computing the standard deviation of samples using multiple\nstochastic forward propagations, which is time-consuming for tasks based on\npoint clouds containing massive points. Hence, a framework embedded with NSA-MC\ndropout, a variant of MC dropout, is proposed to establish distributions in\njust one forward pass. Specifically, the NSA-MC dropout samples the model many\ntimes through a space-dependent way, outputting point-wise distribution by\naggregating stochastic inference results of neighbors. Based on this, aleatoric\nand predictive uncertainties acquire from the predictive distribution. The\naleatoric uncertainty is integrated into the loss function to penalize noisy\npoints, avoiding the over-fitting of the model to some degree. Besides, the\npredictive uncertainty quantifies the confidence degree of predictions.\nExperimental results show that our framework obtains better segmentation\nresults of real-world point clouds and efficiently quantifies the credibility\nof results. Our NSA-MC dropout is several times faster than MC dropout, and the\ninference time does not establish a coupling relation with the sampling times.\nThe code will be available if the paper is accepted.",

The second is based on the\nReed-Solomon codes and Guruswami-Sudan list decoding algorithm. The first\nscheme provides an energy efficiency very close to the random coding bound when\nthe decoding complexity is unbounded. But for the practical parameters, the\nsecond scheme is better and improves the performance of a tree code-based\nscheme when the number of active users is less than 200.",

Specifically, based on our\nobservation that heads in ViT display different quantization robustness, we\nleverage head-wise bit-width to squeeze the size of Q-ViT while preserving\nperformance. In addition, we propose a novel technique named switchable scale\nto resolve the convergence problem in the joint training of quantization scales\nand bit-widths. In this way, Q-ViT pushes the limits of ViT quantization to\n3-bit without heavy performance drop. Moreover, we analyze the quantization\nrobustness of every architecture component of ViT and show that the Multi-head\nSelf-Attention (MSA) and the Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELU) are the key\naspects for ViT quantization. This study provides some insights for further\nresearch about ViT quantization.

Most notably, edge-box GPUs lack the memory\nneeded to concurrently house the growing number of (increasingly complex)\nmodels for real-time inference. Unfortunately, existing solutions that rely on\ntime/space sharing of GPU resources are insufficient as the required swapping\ndelays result in unacceptable frame drops and accuracy violations. We present\nmodel merging, a new memory management technique that exploits architectural\nsimilarities between edge vision models by judiciously sharing their layers\n(including weights) to reduce workload memory costs and swapping delays. Our\nsystem, GEMEL, efficiently integrates merging into existing pipelines by (1)\nleveraging several guiding observations about per-model memory usage and\ninter-layer dependencies to quickly identify fruitful and accuracy-preserving\nmerging configurations, and (2) altering edge inference schedules to maximize\nmerging benefits. Experiments across diverse workloads reveal that GEMEL\nreduces memory usage by up to 60.7%, and improves overall accuracy by 8-39%\nrelative to time/space sharing alone.",

In reality, the test data is not even available\nduring the training process, making selection bias agnostic. Training GNNs with\nbiased selected nodes leads to significant parameter estimation bias and\ngreatly impacts the generalization ability on test nodes. In this paper, we\nfirst present an experimental investigation, which clearly shows that the\nselection bias drastically hinders the generalization ability of GNNs, and\ntheoretically prove that the selection bias will cause the biased estimation on\nGNN parameters. Then to remove the bias in GNN estimation, we propose a novel\nDebiased Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with a differentiated decorrelation\nregularizer. The differentiated decorrelation regularizer estimates a sample\nweight for each labeled node such that the spurious correlation of learned\nembeddings could be eliminated. We analyze the regularizer in causal view and\nit motivates us to differentiate the weights of the variables based on their\ncontribution on the confounding bias. Then, these sample weights are used for\nreweighting GNNs to eliminate the estimation bias, thus help to improve the\nstability of prediction on unknown test nodes. Comprehensive experiments are\nconducted on several challenging graph datasets with two kinds of label\nselection biases.

Typically, classification rules or decision trees are\nused due to the intelligibility of their logic-based expressions. However,\ndecision trees can grow too deep and rule sets can become too large to\napproximate a complex model. Unlike paths on a decision tree that must share\nancestor nodes (conditions), rules are more flexible. However, the unstructured\nvisual representation of rules makes it hard to make inferences across rules.\nTo address these issues, we present a workflow that includes novel algorithmic\nand interactive solutions. First, we present Hierarchical Surrogate Rules\n(HSR), an algorithm that generates hierarchical rules based on user-defined\nparameters. We also contribute SuRE, a visual analytics (VA) system that\nintegrates HSR and interactive surrogate rule visualizations. Particularly, we\npresent a novel feature-aligned tree to overcome the shortcomings of existing\nrule visualizations. We evaluate the algorithm in terms of parameter\nsensitivity, time performance, and comparison with surrogate decision trees and\nfind that it scales reasonably well and outperforms decision trees in many\nrespects. We also evaluate the visualization and the VA system by a usability\nstudy with 24 volunteers and an observational study with 7 domain experts. Our\ninvestigation shows that the participants can use feature-aligned trees to\nperform non-trivial tasks with very high accuracy.

    "title": "\"Learn the Facts About COVID-19\": Analyzing the Use of Warning Labels on  TikTok Videos",
    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, health-related misinformation and harmful\ncontent shared online had a significant adverse effect on society. To mitigate\nthis adverse effect, mainstream social media platforms employed soft moderation\ninterventions (i.e., warning labels) on potentially harmful posts. Despite the\nrecent popularity of these moderation interventions, we lack empirical analyses\naiming to uncover how these warning labels are used in the wild, particularly\nduring challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we analyze\nthe use of warning labels on TikTok, focusing on COVID-19 videos. First, we\nconstruct a set of 26 COVID-19 related hashtags, then we collect 41K videos\nthat include those hashtags in their description. Second, we perform a\nquantitative analysis on the entire dataset to understand the use of warning\nlabels on TikTok. Then, we perform an in-depth qualitative study, using\nthematic analysis, on 222 COVID-19 related videos to assess the content and the\nconnection between the content and the warning labels. Our analysis shows that\nTikTok broadly applies warning labels on TikTok videos, likely based on\nhashtags included in the description. More worrying is the addition of COVID-19\nwarning labels on videos where their actual content is not related to COVID-19\n(23% of the cases in a sample of 143 English videos that are not related to\nCOVID-19). Finally, our qualitative analysis on a sample of 222 videos shows\nthat 7.7% of the videos share misinformation/harmful content and do not include\nwarning labels, 37.3% share benign information and include warning labels, and\nthat 35% of the videos that share misinformation/harmful content (and need a\nwarning label) are made for fun. Our study demonstrates the need to develop\nmore accurate and precise soft moderation systems, especially on a platform\nlike TikTok that is extremely popular among people of younger age.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation addresses visual scene understanding and enhances\nsegmentation performance and generalization, training efficiency of networks,\nand holistic understanding. First, we investigate semantic segmentation in the\ncontext of street scenes and train semantic segmentation networks on\ncombinations of various datasets. In Chapter 2 we design a framework of\nhierarchical classifiers over a single convolutional backbone, and train it\nend-to-end on a combination of pixel-labeled datasets, improving\ngeneralizability and the number of recognizable semantic concepts. Chapter 3\nfocuses on enriching semantic segmentation with weak supervision and proposes a\nweakly-supervised algorithm for training with bounding box-level and\nimage-level supervision instead of only with per-pixel supervision. The memory\nand computational load challenges that arise from simultaneous training on\nmultiple datasets are addressed in Chapter 4. We propose two methodologies for\nselecting informative and diverse samples from datasets with weak supervision\nto reduce our networks' ecological footprint without sacrificing performance.\nMotivated by memory and computation efficiency requirements, in Chapter 5, we\nrethink simultaneous training on heterogeneous datasets and propose a universal\nsemantic segmentation framework. This framework achieves consistent increases\nin performance metrics and semantic knowledgeability by exploiting various\nscene understanding datasets. Chapter 6 introduces the novel task of part-aware\npanoptic segmentation, which extends our reasoning towards holistic scene\nunderstanding. This task combines scene and parts-level semantics with\ninstance-level object detection. In conclusion, our contributions span over\nconvolutional network architectures, weakly-supervised learning, part and\npanoptic segmentation, paving the way towards a holistic, rich, and sustainable\nvisual scene understanding.",

    "abstract": "For distributed protocols involving many servers, assuming that they do not\ncollude with each other makes some secrecy problems solvable and reduces\noverheads and computational hardness assumptions in others. While the\nnon-collusion assumption is pervasive among privacy-preserving systems, it\nremains highly susceptible to covert, undetectable collusion among computing\nparties. This work stems from an observation that if the number of available\ncomputing parties is much higher than the number of parties required to perform\na secure computation, collusion attempts could be deterred.\nWe focus on the standard problem of multi-server private information\nretrieval (PIR) that inherently assumes that servers do not collude. For PIR\napplication scenarios, such as those for blockchain light clients, where the\navailable servers are plentiful, a single server's deviating action is not\ntremendously beneficial to itself. We can make deviations undesired through\nsmall amounts of rewards and penalties, thus raising the bar for collusion\nsignificantly. For any given multi-server 1-private PIR (i.e. the base PIR\nscheme is constructed assuming no pairwise collusion), we provide a collusion\nmitigation mechanism. We first define a two-stage sequential game that captures\nhow rational servers interact with each other during collusion, then determine\nthe payment rules such that the game realizes the unique sequential\nequilibrium: a non-collusion outcome. We also offer privacy protection for an\nextended period beyond the time the query executions happen, and guarantee user\ncompensation in case of a reported privacy breach. Overall, we conjecture that\nthe incentive structure for collusion mitigation to be functional towards\nrelaxing the strong non-collusion assumptions across a variety of multi-party\ncomputation tasks.",

To model the\nimaging geometry and the scanning motion of the panoramic KH-4 cameras, a\nrigorous camera model consisting of modified collinearity equations with time\ndependent exterior orientation parameters is employed.

The distortion pattern of image residuals of GCPs and y-parallax\nin epipolar resampled images suggest that film distortions due to long term\nstorage as likely cause of systematic deviations.

This leads to poor spectrum\nutilization, the fundamental objective of shared spectrum systems.\nTo allocate spectrum near-optimally to secondary users in general scenarios,\nwe fundamentally need to have knowledge of the signal path-loss function. In\npractice, however, even the best known path-loss models have unsatisfactory\naccuracy, and conducting extensive surveys to gather path-loss values is\ninfeasible. To circumvent this challenge, we propose to learn the spectrum\nallocation function directly using supervised learning techniques. We\nparticularly address the scenarios when the primary users' information may not\nbe available; for such settings, we make use of a crowdsourced sensing\narchitecture and use the spectrum sensor readings as features. We develop an\nefficient CNN-based approach (called DeepAlloc) and address various challenges\nthat arise in its application to the learning the spectrum allocation function.\nVia extensive large-scale simulation and a small testbed, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our developed techniques; in particular, we observe that our\napproach improves the accuracy of standard learning techniques and prior work\nby up to 60%.",

    "abstract": "One of the most remarkable things about the human moral mind is its\nflexibility. We can make moral judgments about cases we have never seen before.\nWe can decide that pre-established rules should be broken. We can invent novel\nrules on the fly. Capturing this flexibility is one of the central challenges\nin developing AI systems that can interpret and produce human-like moral\njudgment. This paper details the results of a study of real-world decision\nmakers who judge whether it is acceptable to break a well-established norm:\n``no cutting in line.'' We gather data on how human participants judge the\nacceptability of line-cutting in a range of scenarios. Then, in order to\neffectively embed these reasoning capabilities into a machine, we propose a\nmethod for modeling them using a preference-based structure, which captures a\nnovel modification to standard ``dual process'' theories of moral judgment.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of cyberattacks in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) calls for a\nmechanism that can evaluate critical infrastructures' operational behaviour and\nsecurity without affecting the operation of live systems. In this regard,\nDigital Twins (DTs) provide actionable insights through monitoring, simulating,\npredicting, and optimizing the state of CPSs. Through the use cases, including\nsystem testing and training, detecting system misconfigurations, and security\ntesting, DTs strengthen the security of CPSs throughout the product lifecycle.\nHowever, such benefits of DTs depend on an assumption about data integrity and\nsecurity. Data trustworthiness becomes more critical while integrating multiple\ncomponents among different DTs owned by various stakeholders to provide an\naggregated view of the complex physical system. This article envisions a\nblockchain-based DT framework as Trusted Twins for Securing Cyber-Physical\nSystems (TTS-CPS). With the automotive industry as a CPS use case, we\ndemonstrate the viability of the TTS-CPS framework in a proof of concept. To\nutilize reliable system specification data for building the process knowledge\nof DTs, we ensure the trustworthiness of data-generating sources through\nintegrity checking mechanisms. Additionally, the safety and security rules\nevaluated during simulation are stored and retrieved from the blockchain,\nthereby establishing more understanding and confidence in the decisions made by\nthe underlying systems.

    "abstract": "Learning to solve precision-based manipulation tasks from visual feedback\nusing Reinforcement Learning (RL) could drastically reduce the engineering\nefforts required by traditional robot systems. However, performing fine-grained\nmotor control from visual inputs alone is challenging, especially with a static\nthird-person camera as often used in previous work. We propose a setting for\nrobotic manipulation in which the agent receives visual feedback from both a\nthird-person camera and an egocentric camera mounted on the robot's wrist.\nWhile the third-person camera is static, the egocentric camera enables the\nrobot to actively control its vision to aid in precise manipulation. To fuse\nvisual information from both cameras effectively, we additionally propose to\nuse Transformers with a cross-view attention mechanism that models spatial\nattention from one view to another (and vice-versa), and use the learned\nfeatures as input to an RL policy. Our method improves learning over strong\nsingle-view and multi-view baselines, and successfully transfers to a set of\nchallenging manipulation tasks on a real robot with uncalibrated cameras, no\naccess to state information, and a high degree of task variability. In a hammer\nmanipulation task, our method succeeds in 75% of trials versus 38% and 13% for\nmulti-view and single-view baselines, respectively.",

While most previous studies rely on\naccurate explicit structural information, recent works explore the implicit\nscene representation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for realistic generation.\nIn order to capture the inconsistent motions as well as the semantic difference\nbetween human head and torso, some work models them via two individual sets of\nNeRF, leading to unnatural results. In this work, we propose Semantic-aware\nSpeaking Portrait NeRF (SSP-NeRF), which creates delicate audio-driven\nportraits using one unified set of NeRF. The proposed model can handle the\ndetailed local facial semantics and the global head-torso relationship through\ntwo semantic-aware modules. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Aware\nDynamic Ray Sampling module with an additional parsing branch that facilitates\naudio-driven volume rendering. Moreover, to enable portrait rendering in one\nunified neural radiance field, a Torso Deformation module is designed to\nstabilize the large-scale non-rigid torso motions.

These\nsignals contain information about the nature of the remnant and the\nhigh-density and out-of-equilibrium physics of the postmerger processes, which\nwould complement any electromagnetic signal. However, the construction of\nbinary neutron star postmerger waveforms is much more complicated than for\nbinary black holes: (i) there are theoretical uncertainties in the neutron-star\nequation of state and other aspects of the high-density physics, (ii) numerical\nsimulations are expensive and available ones only cover a small fraction of the\nparameter space with limited numerical accuracy, and (iii) it is unclear how to\nparametrize the theoretical uncertainties and interpolate across parameter\nspace. In this work, we describe the use of a machine-learning method called a\nconditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to construct postmerger models for\nhyper/massive neutron star remnant signals based on numerical-relativity\nsimulations.

To this end, by modeling the key\ntransmission modules as an end-to-end (E2E) neural network, this paper proposes\na data-driven deep learning (DL)-based unified hybrid beamforming framework for\nboth the time division duplex (TDD) and frequency division duplex (FDD) systems\nwith implicit channel state information (CSI). For TDD systems, the proposed\nDL-based approach jointly models the uplink pilot combining and downlink hybrid\nbeamforming modules as an E2E neural network. While for FDD systems, we jointly\nmodel the downlink pilot transmission, uplink CSI feedback, and downlink hybrid\nbeamforming modules as an E2E neural network. Different from conventional\napproaches separately processing different modules, the proposed solution\nsimultaneously optimizes all modules with the sum rate as the optimization\nobject. Therefore, by perceiving the inherent property of air-to-ground massive\nMIMO-OFDM channel samples, the DL-based E2E neural network can establish the\nmapping function from the channel to the beamformer, so that the explicit\nchannel reconstruction can be avoided with reduced pilot and feedback overhead.\nBesides, practical low-resolution phase shifters (PSs) introduce the\nquantization constraint, leading to the intractable gradient backpropagation\nwhen training the neural network. To mitigate the performance loss caused by\nthe phase quantization error, we adopt the transfer learning strategy to\nfurther fine-tune the E2E neural network based on a pre-trained network that\nassumes the ideal infinite-resolution PSs. Numerical results show that our\nDL-based schemes have considerable advantages over state-of-the-art schemes.",

    "abstract": "We study the global convergence of policy gradient for infinite-horizon,\ncontinuous state and action space, entropy-regularized Markov decision\nprocesses (MDPs). We consider a softmax policy with (one-hidden layer) neural\nnetwork approximation in a mean-field regime. Additional entropic\nregularization in the associated mean-field probability measure is added, and\nthe corresponding gradient flow is studied in the 2-Wasserstein metric. We show\nthat the objective function is increasing along the gradient flow. Further, we\nprove that if the regularization in terms of the mean-field measure is\nsufficient, the gradient flow converges exponentially fast to the unique\nstationary solution, which is the unique maximizer of the regularized MDP\nobjective. Lastly, we study the sensitivity of the value function along the\ngradient flow with respect to regularization parameters and the initial\ncondition. Our results rely on the careful analysis of non-linear\nFokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equation and extend the pioneering work of Mei et\nal. 2020 and Agarwal et al. 2020, which quantify the global convergence rate of\npolicy gradient for entropy-regularized MDPs in the tabular setting.",

To\ntackle this problem, we apply a deep learning-based approach for the\nmulti-class semantic segmentation of a $\\gamma$-Alumina/Pt catalytic material\nin a class imbalance situation.

    "title": "Lung Swapping Autoencoder: Learning a Disentangled Structure-texture  Representation of Chest Radiographs",
    "abstract": "Well-labeled datasets of chest radiographs (CXRs) are difficult to acquire\ndue to the high cost of annotation. Thus, it is desirable to learn a robust and\ntransferable representation in an unsupervised manner to benefit tasks that\nlack labeled data. Unlike natural images, medical images have their own domain\nprior; e.g., we observe that many pulmonary diseases, such as the COVID-19,\nmanifest as changes in the lung tissue texture rather than the anatomical\nstructure. Therefore, we hypothesize that studying only the texture without the\ninfluence of structure variations would be advantageous for downstream\nprognostic and predictive modeling tasks. In this paper, we propose a\ngenerative framework, the Lung Swapping Autoencoder (LSAE), that learns\nfactorized representations of a CXR to disentangle the texture factor from the\nstructure factor. Specifically, by adversarial training, the LSAE is optimized\nto generate a hybrid image that preserves the lung shape in one image but\ninherits the lung texture of another. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the\ndisentangled texture representation, we evaluate the texture encoder $Enc^t$ in\nLSAE on ChestX-ray14 (N=112,120), and our own multi-institutional COVID-19\noutcome prediction dataset, COVOC (N=340 (Subset-1) + 53 (Subset-2)). On both\ndatasets, we reach or surpass the state-of-the-art by finetuning $Enc^t$ in\nLSAE that is 77% smaller than a baseline Inception v3. Additionally, in\nsemi-and-self supervised settings with a similar model budget, $Enc^t$ in LSAE\nis also competitive with the state-of-the-art MoCo. By \"re-mixing\" the texture\nand shape factors, we generate meaningful hybrid images that can augment the\ntraining set. This data augmentation method can further improve COVOC\nprediction performance. The improvement is consistent even when we directly\nevaluate the Subset-1 trained model on Subset-2 without any fine-tuning.",

The resolution and acquisition rate of such systems\nis increasing significantly in recent years under the fast development of image\nsensing technology. This enables the detection of tiny defects in real-time.\nHowever, such a high resolution and acquisition rate of image data not only\nslows down the speed of image processing algorithms but also increases data\nstorage and transmission cost. To tackle this problem, we propose a fast and\ndata-efficient method with theoretical performance guarantee that is suitable\nfor sparse anomaly detection in images with a smooth background (smooth plus\nsparse signal). The proposed method, named Compressed Smooth Sparse\nDecomposition (CSSD), is a one-step method that unifies the compressive image\nacquisition and decomposition-based image processing techniques. To further\nenhance its performance in a high-dimensional scenario, a Kronecker Compressed\nSmooth Sparse Decomposition (KronCSSD) method is proposed. Compared to\ntraditional smooth and sparse decomposition algorithms, significant\ntransmission cost reduction and computational speed boost can be achieved with\nnegligible performance loss. Simulation examples and several case studies in\nvarious applications illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

Our method lifts the objective into an extended form\nthat allows both the smooth terms and the bilinear term to be handled optimally\nand seamlessly with the same primal-dual framework. Besides optimality, our\nmethod yields a desirably simple single-loop algorithm that uses only one\ngradient oracle call per iteration.

A first solution of this problem was presented in the second part of\nthe book: \"Observability: A New Theory Based on the Group of Invariance\" [45].\nThe solution presented by this paper completes the previous solution in [45].\nIn particular, the new solution exhaustively accounts for the systems that do\nnot belong to the category of the systems that are canonic with respect to\ntheir unknown inputs. The new solution is also provided in the form of a new\nalgorithm. A further novelty with respect to the algorithm provided in [45]\nconsists of a new convergence criterion that holds in all the cases (the\nconvergence criterion of the algorithm provided in [45] can fail in some\ncases). Finally, we also provide the answer to the problem of unknown input\nreconstruction which is intimately related to the problem of state\nobservability. We illustrate the implementation of the new algorithm by\nstudying a nonlinear system in the framework of visual-inertial sensor fusion.",

    "abstract": "In this work, a kind of distributed constraint-coupled optimization problem\nis studied. We first propose an augmented primal-dual dynamics and study its\nconvergence, but the need for knowing the violation of the coupled constraint\nprevents it from being implemented distributedly. By comprehending a classical\ncontinuous-time distributed optimization algorithm from a new perspective, the\nnovel implicit tracking approach is proposed to track the violation\ndistributedly, which leads to the \\underline{i}mplicit tracking-based\n\\underline{d}istribut\\underline{e}d \\underline{a}ugmented primal-dual dynamics\n(IDEA). To deal with the cases where local constrained sets exist, we further\ndevelop a projected variant of IDEA, i.e., Proj-IDEA. Under the undirected and\nconnected communication topology, the convergence of IDEA can be guaranteed\nwhen local objective functions are only convex, and if local objective\nfunctions are strongly convex and smooth, IDEA can converge exponentially with\na quite weak condition about the constraint matrix. In line with IDEA,\nProj-IDEA can also guarantee convergence when local objective functions are\nonly convex. Furthermore, we also explore the convergences of IDEA and\nProj-IDEA under the directed, strongly connected, and weight-balanced\ncommunication topology. Finally, numerical experiments are taken to corroborate\nour theoretical results.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal data arise in various applications where information about the\nsame phenomenon is acquired from multiple sensors and across different imaging\nmodalities. Learning from multimodal data is of great interest in machine\nlearning and statistics research as this offers the possibility of capturing\ncomplementary information among modalities. Multimodal modeling helps to\nexplain the interdependence between heterogeneous data sources, discovers new\ninsights that may not be available from a single modality, and improves\ndecision-making. Recently, coupled matrix-tensor factorization has been\nintroduced for multimodal data fusion to jointly estimate latent factors and\nidentify complex interdependence among the latent factors. However, most of the\nprior work on coupled matrix-tensor factors focuses on unsupervised learning\nand there is little work on supervised learning using the jointly estimated\nlatent factors. This paper considers the multimodal tensor data classification\nproblem. A Coupled Support Tensor Machine (C-STM) built upon the latent factors\njointly estimated from the Advanced Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization (ACMTF)\nis proposed. C-STM combines individual and shared latent factors with multiple\nkernels and estimates a maximal-margin classifier for coupled matrix tensor\ndata. The classification risk of C-STM is shown to converge to the optimal\nBayes risk, making it a statistically consistent rule. C-STM is validated\nthrough simulation studies as well as a simultaneous EEG-fMRI analysis. The\nempirical evidence shows that C-STM can utilize information from multiple\nsources and provide a better classification performance than traditional\nsingle-mode classifiers.",
