    "abstract": "Machine learning can be enhanced through the integration of external\nknowledge. This method, called knowledge informed machine learning, is also\napplicable within the field of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). In this\npaper, the various methods of knowledge informed machine learning, from a PHM\ncontext, are reviewed with the goal of helping the reader understand the\ndomain. In addition, a knowledge informed machine learning technique is\ndemonstrated, using the common IMS and PRONOSTIA bearing data sets, for\nremaining useful life (RUL) prediction. Specifically, knowledge is garnered\nfrom the field of reliability engineering which is represented through the\nWeibull distribution. The knowledge is then integrated into a neural network\nthrough a novel Weibull-based loss function. A thorough statistical analysis of\nthe Weibull-based loss function is conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness\nof the method on the PRONOSTIA data set. However, the Weibull-based loss\nfunction is less effective on the IMS data set. The results, shortcomings, and\nbenefits of the approach are discussed in length. Finally, all the code is\npublicly available for the benefit of other researchers.",

    "abstract": "Financial forecasting has been an important and active area of machine\nlearning research because of the challenges it presents and the potential\nrewards that even minor improvements in prediction accuracy or forecasting may\nentail. Traditionally, financial forecasting has heavily relied on quantitative\nindicators and metrics derived from structured financial statements. Earnings\nconference call data, including text and audio, is an important source of\nunstructured data that has been used for various prediction tasks using deep\nearning and related approaches. However, current deep learning-based methods\nare limited in the way that they deal with numeric data; numbers are typically\ntreated as plain-text tokens without taking advantage of their underlying\nnumeric structure. This paper describes a numeric-oriented hierarchical\ntransformer model to predict stock returns, and financial risk using\nmulti-modal aligned earnings calls data by taking advantage of the different\ncategories of numbers (monetary, temporal, percentages etc.) and their\nmagnitude. We present the results of a comprehensive evaluation of NumHTML\nagainst several state-of-the-art baselines using a real-world publicly\navailable dataset. The results indicate that NumHTML significantly outperforms\nthe current state-of-the-art across a variety of evaluation metrics and that it\nhas the potential to offer significant financial gains in a practical trading\ncontext.",

    "abstract": "Annotating musical beats is a very long in tedious process. In order to\ncombat this problem, we present a new self-supervised learning pretext task for\nbeat tracking and downbeat estimation. This task makes use of Spleeter, an\naudio source separation model, to separate a song's drums from the rest of its\nsignal. The first set of signals are used as positives, and by extension\nnegatives, for contrastive learning pre-training. The drum-less signals, on the\nother hand, are used as anchors. When pre-training a fully-convolutional and\nrecurrent model using this pretext task, an onset function is learned. In some\ncases, this function was found to be mapped to periodic elements in a song. We\nfound that pre-trained models outperformed randomly initialized models when a\nbeat tracking training set was extremely small (less than 10 examples). When\nthat was not the case, pre-training led to a learning speed-up that caused the\nmodel to overfit to the training set. More generally, this work defines new\nperspectives in the realm of musical self-supervised learning. It is notably\none of the first works to use audio source separation as a fundamental\ncomponent of self-supervision.",

In this study, we\npropose artificial neural networks to classify these types of graphical\nresponses from a computer based international mathematics and science\nassessment.

Our results show that convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) outperform feedforward neural networks in both loss and accuracy. The\nCNN models classified up to 97.71% of the image responses into the appropriate\nscoring category, which is comparable to, if not more accurate, than typical\nhuman raters. These findings were further strengthened by the observation that\nthe most accurate CNN models correctly classified some image responses that had\nbeen incorrectly scored by the human raters. As an additional innovation, we\noutline a method to select human rated responses for the training sample based\non an application of the expected response function derived from item response\ntheory.

    "title": "Does entity abstraction help generative Transformers reason?",
    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (LMs) often struggle to reason logically or\ngeneralize in a compositional fashion. Recent work suggests that incorporating\nexternal entity knowledge can improve LMs' abilities to reason and generalize.\nHowever, the effect of explicitly providing entity abstraction remains unclear,\nespecially with recent studies suggesting that pre-trained LMs already encode\nsome of that knowledge in their parameters. We study the utility of\nincorporating entity type abstractions into pre-trained Transformers and test\nthese methods on four NLP tasks requiring different forms of logical reasoning:\n(1) compositional language understanding with text-based relational reasoning\n(CLUTRR), (2) abductive reasoning (ProofWriter), (3) multi-hop question\nanswering (HotpotQA), and (4) conversational question answering (CoQA). We\npropose and empirically explore three ways to add such abstraction: (i) as\nadditional input embeddings, (ii) as a separate sequence to encode, and (iii)\nas an auxiliary prediction task for the model. Overall, our analysis\ndemonstrates that models with abstract entity knowledge performs better than\nwithout it. However, our experiments also show that the benefits strongly\ndepend on the technique used and the task at hand. The best abstraction aware\nmodels achieved an overall accuracy of 88.8% and 91.8% compared to the baseline\nmodel achieving 62.3% and 89.8% on CLUTRR and ProofWriter respectively. In\naddition, abstraction-aware models showed improved compositional generalization\nin both interpolation and extrapolation settings. However, for HotpotQA and\nCoQA, we find that F1 scores improve by only 0.5% on average. Our results\nsuggest that the benefit of explicit abstraction is significant in formally\ndefined logical reasoning settings requiring many reasoning hops, but point to\nthe notion that it is less beneficial for NLP tasks having less formal logical\nstructure.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer and adapt knowledge\nfrom a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Traditionally,\nsubspace-based methods form an important class of solutions to this problem.\nDespite their mathematical elegance and tractability, these methods are often\nfound to be ineffective at producing domain-invariant features with complex,\nreal-world datasets. Motivated by the recent advances in representation\nlearning with deep networks, this paper revisits the use of subspace alignment\nfor UDA and proposes a novel adaptation algorithm that consistently leads to\nimproved generalization. In contrast to existing adversarial training-based DA\nmethods, our approach isolates feature learning and distribution alignment\nsteps, and utilizes a primary-auxiliary optimization strategy to effectively\nbalance the objectives of domain invariance and model fidelity. While providing\na significant reduction in target data and computational requirements, our\nsubspace-based DA performs competitively and sometimes even outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches on several standard UDA benchmarks. Furthermore,\nsubspace alignment leads to intrinsically well-regularized models that\ndemonstrate strong generalization even in the challenging partial DA setting.\nFinally, the design of our UDA framework inherently supports progressive\nadaptation to new target domains at test-time, without requiring retraining of\nthe model from scratch. In summary, powered by powerful feature learners and an\neffective optimization strategy, we establish subspace-based DA as a highly\neffective approach for visual recognition.",

Key to\nCausalSim is the novel use of adversarial neural network training that exploits\ndistributional invariances that are present due to the training data coming\nfrom an RCT. Our extensive evaluation of CausalSim on both real and synthetic\ndatasets and two use cases, including more than nine months of real data from\nthe Puffer video streaming system, shows that it provides accurate\ncounterfactual predictions, reducing prediction error by 44% and 53% on average\ncompared to expert-designed and standard supervised learning baselines.",

However, the\nuse of a general economic objective such as maximizing the absorption\nefficiency of the column can cause EMPC to drive the state of the system close\nto the constraints.

In\nrecent years, variational quantum circuits have emerged as one of the most\nsuccessful approaches to quantum deep learning on noisy intermediate scale\nquantum devices. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical neural network\narchitecture where each neuron is a variational quantum circuit. We empirically\nanalyze the performance of this hybrid neural network on a series of binary\nclassification data sets using a simulated universal quantum computer and a\nstate of the art universal quantum computer. On simulated hardware, we observe\nthat the hybrid neural network achieves roughly 10% higher classification\naccuracy and 20% better minimization of cost than an individual variational\nquantum circuit. On quantum hardware, we observe that each model only performs\nwell when the qubit and gate count is sufficiently small.",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims at recognizing classes for which no visual\nsample is available at training time. To address this issue, one can rely on a\nsemantic description of each class. A typical ZSL model learns a mapping\nbetween the visual samples of seen classes and the corresponding semantic\ndescriptions, in order to do the same on unseen classes at test time. State of\nthe art approaches rely on generative models that synthesize visual features\nfrom the prototype of a class, such that a classifier can then be learned in a\nsupervised manner. However, these approaches are usually biased towards seen\nclasses whose visual instances are the only one that can be matched to a given\nclass prototype. We propose a regularization method that can be applied to any\nconditional generative-based ZSL method, by leveraging only the semantic class\nprototypes. It learns to synthesize discriminative features for possible\nsemantic description that are not available at training time, that is the\nunseen ones. The approach is evaluated for ZSL and GZSL on four datasets\ncommonly used in the literature, either in inductive and transductive settings,\nwith results on-par or above state of the art approaches.",

To overcome this limitation, a few approaches infer latent\nvectors on a coarse regular 3D grid or on 3D patches, and interpolate them to\nanswer occupancy queries. In doing so, they loose the direct connection with\nthe input points sampled on the surface of objects, and they attach information\nuniformly in space rather than where it matters the most, i.e., near the\nsurface. Besides, relying on fixed patch sizes may require discretization\ntuning. To address these issues, we propose to use point cloud convolutions and\ncompute latent vectors at each input point. We then perform a learning-based\ninterpolation on nearest neighbors using inferred weights.

Secure processors with hardware-enforced isolation can\nbe a solid foundation of cloud computation in the future. However, due to\nrecent side-channel attacks, the commercial secure processors failed to deliver\nthe promises of a secure isolated execution environment. Sensitive information\ninside the secure execution environment always gets leaked via side channels.\nThis work considers the most powerful software-based side-channel attackers,\ni.e., an All Digital State Observing (ADSO) adversary who can observe all\ndigital states, including all digital states in secure enclaves. Traditional\nsignature schemes are not secure in ADSO adversarial model. We introduce a new\ncryptographic primitive called One-Time Signature with Secret Key Exposure\n(OTS-SKE), which ensures no one can forge a valid signature of a new message or\nnonce even if all secret session keys are leaked. OTS-SKE enables us to sign\nattestation reports securely under the ADSO adversary. We also minimize the\ntrusted computing base by introducing a secure co-processor into the system,\nand the interaction between the secure co-processor and the attestation\nprocessor is unidirectional. That is, the co-processor takes no inputs from the\nprocessor and only generates secret keys for the processor to fetch.

    "abstract": "Continual learning in environments with shifting data distributions is a\nchallenging problem with several real-world applications. In this paper we\nconsider settings in which the data distribution(task) shifts abruptly and the\ntiming of these shifts are not known. Furthermore, we consider a\nsemi-supervised task-agnostic setting in which the learning algorithm has\naccess to both task-segmented and unsegmented data for offline training. We\npropose a novel approach called mixture of Basismodels (MoB) for addressing\nthis problem setting. The core idea is to learn a small set of basis models and\nto construct a dynamic, task-dependent mixture of the models to predict for the\ncurrent task. We also propose a new methodology to detect observations that are\nout-of-distribution with respect to the existing basis models and to\ninstantiate new models as needed. We test our approach in multiple domains and\nshow that it attains better prediction error than existing methods in most\ncases while using fewer models than other multiple model approaches. Moreover,\nwe analyze the latent task representations learned by MoB and show that similar\ntasks tend to cluster in the latent space and that the latent representation\nshifts at the task boundaries when tasks are dissimilar.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing numerous or long time series is difficult in practice due to the\nhigh storage costs and computational requirements. Therefore, techniques have\nbeen proposed to generate compact similarity-preserving representations of time\nseries, enabling real-time similarity search on large in-memory data\ncollections. However, the existing techniques are not ideally suited for\nassessing similarity when sequences are locally out of phase. In this paper, we\npropose the use of product quantization for efficient similarity-based\ncomparison of time series under time warping. The idea is to first compress the\ndata by partitioning the time series into equal length sub-sequences which are\nrepresented by a short code. The distance between two time series can then be\nefficiently approximated by pre-computed elastic distances between their codes.\nThe partitioning into sub-sequences forces unwanted alignments, which we\naddress with a pre-alignment step using the maximal overlap discrete wavelet\ntransform (MODWT). To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our method, we\nperform an extensive experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets in nearest\nneighbors classification and clustering applications. Overall, the proposed\nsolution emerges as a highly efficient (both in terms of memory usage and\ncomputation time) replacement for elastic measures in time series applications.",

Considering the mobility of EVs\nfrom building to building and their uncertain charging demand, it is of great\npractical interest to control the EV charging process in a microgrid of\nbuildings to optimize the total operation cost while ensuring the transmission\nsafety between the microgrid and the main grid. We consider this important\nproblem in this paper and make the following contributions.

Besides reducing the total\noperation cost of buildings, the model also considers the power exchange\nlimitation to ensure transmission safety. Second, this model is reformulated\nunder event-based optimization framework to alleviate the impact of large state\nand action space. By appropriately defining the event and event-based action,\nthe EV charging process can be optimized by searching a randomized parametric\nevent-based control policy in the microgrid controller and implementing a\nselecting-to-charging rule in each building controller. Third, a constrained\ngradient-based policy optimzation method with adjusting mechanism is proposed\nto iteratively find the optimal event-based control policy for EV charging\ndemand in each building.

To recover the substrate\nnetworks from anomaly within a short time, rapid and accurate identification of\nwhether or not the anomaly exists in PNs and PLs is vital. Online anomaly\ndetection methods that can analyze system data in real-time are preferred.\nBesides, as virtual nodes and links mapped to PNs and PLs are scattered in\nmultiple slices, the distributed detection modes are required to adapt to the\nvirtualized environment.

Specifically, to decouple the OCSVM objective function, we\ntransform the original problem to a group of decentralized quadratic\nprogramming problems by introducing the consensus constraints. The alternating\ndirection method of multipliers is adopted to achieve the solution for the\ndistributed online PN anomaly detection. Next, by utilizing the correlation of\nmeasurements between neighbor virtual nodes, another distributed online PL\nanomaly detection algorithm based on the canonical correlation analysis is\nproposed.

We numerically examine the effectiveness of our method using a\nmanufactured solution and observe our method yields optimal convergence rates\nin the $L_2$ norm for the velocity field, pressure field, magnetic field, and\nmagnetic pressure field.

    "abstract": "Control certificates based on barrier functions have been a powerful tool to\ngenerate probably safe control policies for dynamical systems. However,\nexisting methods based on barrier certificates are normally for white-box\nsystems with differentiable dynamics, which makes them inapplicable to many\npractical applications where the system is a black-box and cannot be accurately\nmodeled. On the other side, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods for\nblack-box systems suffer from lack of safety guarantees and low sampling\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can learn safe\ncontrol policies and barrier certificates for black-box dynamical systems,\nwithout requiring for an accurate system model. Our method re-designs the loss\nfunction to back-propagate gradient to the control policy even when the\nblack-box dynamical system is non-differentiable, and we show that the safety\ncertificates hold on the black-box system. Empirical results in simulation show\nthat our method can significantly improve the performance of the learned\npolicies by achieving nearly 100% safety and goal reaching rates using much\nfewer training samples, compared to state-of-the-art black-box safe control\nmethods. Our learned agents can also generalize to unseen scenarios while\nkeeping the original performance. The source code can be found at\nhttps://github.com/Zengyi-Qin/bcbf.",

In particular, we develop a dynamic\nmethod that provisions durable or ephemeral containers depending on the\nspatiotemporal and data-dependency characteristics of the functions. Evaluating\nthe prototype implementation of SMSE under real-world settings demonstrates its\ncapability to reduce both the containerization overhead, and the makespan time\nof serving multimedia processing functions (by up to 30%) in compare to the\nfunction provision methods that are being used in the general-purpose\nserverless cloud systems.",

    "abstract": "Given an aerial image, aerial scene parsing (ASP) targets to interpret the\nsemantic structure of the image content, e.g., by assigning a semantic label to\nevery pixel of the image. With the popularization of data-driven methods, the\npast decades have witnessed promising progress on ASP by approaching the\nproblem with the schemes of tile-level scene classification or\nsegmentation-based image analysis, when using high-resolution aerial images.\nHowever, the former scheme often produces results with tile-wise boundaries,\nwhile the latter one needs to handle the complex modeling process from pixels\nto semantics, which often requires large-scale and well-annotated image samples\nwith pixel-wise semantic labels. In this paper, we address these issues in ASP,\nwith perspectives from tile-level scene classification to pixel-wise semantic\nlabeling. Specifically, we first revisit aerial image interpretation by a\nliterature review. We then present a large-scale scene classification dataset\nthat contains one million aerial images termed Million-AID. With the presented\ndataset, we also report benchmarking experiments using classical convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs). Finally, we perform ASP by unifying the tile-level\nscene classification and object-based image analysis to achieve pixel-wise\nsemantic labeling. Intensive experiments show that Million-AID is a challenging\nyet useful dataset, which can serve as a benchmark for evaluating newly\ndeveloped algorithms. When transferring knowledge from Million-AID, fine-tuning\nCNN models pretrained on Million-AID perform consistently better than those\npretrained ImageNet for aerial scene classification. Moreover, our designed\nhierarchical multi-task learning method achieves the state-of-the-art\npixel-wise classification on the challenging GID, bridging the tile-level scene\nclassification toward pixel-wise semantic labeling for aerial image\ninterpretation.",

    "title": "Federated Optimization of Smooth Loss Functions",
    "abstract": "In this work, we study empirical risk minimization (ERM) within a federated\nlearning framework, where a central server minimizes an ERM objective function\nusing training data that is stored across $m$ clients. In this setting, the\nFederated Averaging (FedAve) algorithm is the staple for determining\n$\\epsilon$-approximate solutions to the ERM problem. Similar to standard\noptimization algorithms, the convergence analysis of FedAve only relies on\nsmoothness of the loss function in the optimization parameter. However, loss\nfunctions are often very smooth in the training data too. To exploit this\nadditional smoothness, we propose the Federated Low Rank Gradient Descent\n(FedLRGD) algorithm. Since smoothness in data induces an approximate low rank\nstructure on the loss function, our method first performs a few rounds of\ncommunication between the server and clients to learn weights that the server\ncan use to approximate clients' gradients. Then, our method solves the ERM\nproblem at the server using inexact gradient descent. To show that FedLRGD can\nhave superior performance to FedAve, we present a notion of federated oracle\ncomplexity as a counterpart to canonical oracle complexity. Under some\nassumptions on the loss function, e.g., strong convexity in parameter,\n$\\eta$-H\\\"older smoothness in data, etc., we prove that the federated oracle\ncomplexity of FedLRGD scales like $\\phi m(p/\\epsilon)^{\\Theta(d/\\eta)}$ and\nthat of FedAve scales like $\\phi m(p/\\epsilon)^{3/4}$ (neglecting sub-dominant\nfactors), where $\\phi\\gg 1$ is a \"communication-to-computation ratio,\" $p$ is\nthe parameter dimension, and $d$ is the data dimension. Then, we show that when\n$d$ is small and the loss function is sufficiently smooth in the data, FedLRGD\nbeats FedAve in federated oracle complexity. Finally, in the course of\nanalyzing FedLRGD, we also establish a result on low rank approximation of\nlatent variable models.",

    "abstract": "Stream monitoring is fundamental in many data stream applications, such as\nfinancial data trackers, security, anomaly detection, and load balancing. In\nthat respect, quantiles are of particular interest, as they often capture the\nuser's utility. For example, if a video connection has high tail latency, the\nperceived quality will suffer, even if the average and median latencies are\nlow.\nIn this work, we consider the problem of approximating the per-item\nquantiles. Elements in our stream are (ID, latency) tuples, and we wish to\ntrack the latency quantiles for each ID.\nExisting quantile sketches are designed for a single number stream (e.g.,\ncontaining just the latency). While one could allocate a separate sketch\ninstance for each ID, this may require an infeasible amount of memory. Instead,\nwe consider tracking the quantiles for the heavy hitters (most frequent items),\nwhich are often considered particularly important, without knowing them\nbeforehand.\nWe first present a simple sampling algorithm that serves as a benchmark.\nThen, we design an algorithm that augments a quantile sketch within each entry\nof a heavy hitter algorithm, resulting in similar space complexity but with a\ndeterministic error guarantee. Finally, we present SQUAD, a method that\ncombines sampling and sketching while improving the asymptotic space\ncomplexity. Intuitively, SQUAD uses a background sampling process to capture\nthe behaviour of the latencies of an item before it is allocated with a sketch,\nthereby allowing us to use fewer samples and sketches. Our solutions are\nrigorously analyzed, and we demonstrate the superiority of our approach using\nextensive simulations.",

Recent methods have proved that generalization and\nspecialization are two essential abilities to achieve good performance in ZSL.\nHowever, they all focus on only one of the abilities, resulting in models that\nare either too general with the degraded classifying ability or too specialized\nto generalize to unseen classes. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end\nnetwork with balanced generalization and specialization abilities, termed as\nBGSNet, to take advantage of both abilities, and balance them at instance- and\ndataset-level. Specifically, BGSNet consists of two branches: the\nGeneralization Network (GNet), which applies episodic meta-learning to learn\ngeneralized knowledge, and the Balanced Specialization Network (BSNet), which\nadopts multiple attentive extractors to extract discriminative features and\nfulfill the instance-level balance. A novel self-adjusting diversity loss is\ndesigned to optimize BSNet with less redundancy and more diversity. We further\npropose a differentiable dataset-level balance and update the weights in a\nlinear annealing schedule to simulate network pruning and thus obtain the\noptimal structure for BSNet at a low cost with dataset-level balance achieved.\nExperiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate our model's effectiveness.\nSufficient component ablations prove the necessity of integrating\ngeneralization and specialization abilities.",

While the traditional\nback-propagation stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and its variants\nare effective in certain cases, they can become stuck at spurious local minima\nand are sensitive to initializations and hyperparameters. Recent work has shown\nthat the training of an ANN with ReLU activations can be reformulated as a\nconvex program, bringing hope to globally optimizing interpretable ANNs.\nHowever, naively solving the convex training formulation has an exponential\ncomplexity, and even an approximation heuristic requires cubic time. In this\nwork, we characterize the quality of this approximation and develop two\nefficient algorithms that train ANNs with global convergence guarantees. The\nfirst algorithm is based on the alternating direction method of multiplier\n(ADMM). It solves both the exact convex formulation and the approximate\ncounterpart. Linear global convergence is achieved, and the initial several\niterations often yield a solution with high prediction accuracy. When solving\nthe approximate formulation, the per-iteration time complexity is quadratic.\nThe second algorithm, based on the \"sampled convex programs\" theory, is simpler\nto implement. It solves unconstrained convex formulations and converges to an\napproximately globally optimal classifier. The non-convexity of the ANN\ntraining landscape exacerbates when adversarial training is considered. We\napply the robust convex optimization theory to convex training and develop\nconvex formulations that train ANNs robust to adversarial inputs.

    "abstract": "Distributed data processing platforms (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, and Flink) are\nwidely used to distribute the storage and processing of data among computing\nnodes of a cloud. The centralization of cloud resources has given birth to edge\ncomputing, which enables the processing of data closer to the data source\ninstead of sending it to the cloud. However, due to resource constraints such\nas energy limitations, edge computing cannot be used for deploying all kinds of\napplications. Therefore, tasks are offloaded from an edge device to the more\nresourceful cloud. Previous research has evaluated the energy consumption of\nthe distributed data processing platforms in the isolated cloud and edge\nenvironments. However, there is a paucity of research on evaluating the energy\nconsumption of these platforms in an integrated edge-cloud environment, where\ntasks are offloaded from a resource-constraint device to a resource-rich\ndevice. Therefore, in this paper, we first present a framework for the\nenergy-aware evaluation of the distributed data processing platforms. We then\nleverage the proposed framework to evaluate the energy consumption of the three\nmost widely used platforms (i.e., Hadoop, Spark, and Flink) in an integrated\nedge-cloud environment consisting of Raspberry Pi, edge node, edge server node,\nprivate cloud, and public cloud. Our evaluation reveals that (i) Flink is most\nenergy-efficient followed by Spark and Hadoop is found least energy-efficient\n(ii) offloading tasks from resource-constraint to resource-rich devices reduces\nenergy consumption by 55.2%, and (iii) bandwidth and distance between client\nand server are found key factors impacting the energy consumption.",

Though recent refinement-based models can exploit both\npast and future context by generating a new caption in the second stage based\non pre-retrieved or pre-generated captions in the first stage, the decoder of\nthese models generally consists of two networks~(i.e. a retriever or captioner\nin the first stage and a refiner in the second stage), which can only be\nexecuted sequentially. In this paper, we introduce a Compact Bidirectional\nTransformer model for image captioning that can leverage bidirectional context\nimplicitly and explicitly while the decoder can be executed parallelly.\nSpecifically, it is implemented by tightly coupling left-to-right(L2R) and\nright-to-left(R2L) flows into a single compact model~(i.e. implicitly) and\noptionally allowing interaction of the two flows(i.e. explicitly), while the\nfinal caption is chosen from either L2R or R2L flow in a sentence-level\nensemble manner.

    "title": "User-Centric Cooperative Transmissions-enabled Handover for Ultra-Dense  Networks",
    "abstract": "The user-centric cooperative transmission provides a compelling way to\nalleviate frequent handovers caused by an ever-increasing number of randomly\ndeployed base stations (BSs) in ultra-dense networks (UDNs). This paper\nproposes a new user-centric cooperative transmissions-based handover scheme,\ni.e., the group-cell handover (GCHO) scheme, with the aim of reducing the\nhandover rate in UDNs. In the proposed scheme, the boundary of the cooperating\ncluster depends on the distance among the user equipment (UE) and cooperating\nBSs. The new scheme captures the dynamicity and irregularity of the cooperating\ncluster topology resulting from randomly distributed BSs. Based on\nstochastic-geometry tools where BSs locations are modeled as the Poison point\nprocess (PPP), we derive an analytical expression of the handover rate for the\nUE with an arbitrary movement trajectory. Furthermore, a GCHO skipping (GCHO-S)\nscheme is proposed to minimize the handover cost, i.e., the percentage of time\nwasted in handover signaling in user-centric cooperative transmissions\nscenarios. The numerical results show that the GCHO scheme decreases the\nhandover rate by 42.3% and 72.7% compared with the traditional single BS\nassociation and fixed-region cooperative network topology handover approaches,\nrespectively. Moreover, under the same group-cell size and constant velocity,\nthe GCHO-S scheme diminishes the handover cost by 50% against the GCHO scheme.",

    "title": "Improving Mandarin End-to-End Speech Recognition with Word N-gram  Language Model",
    "abstract": "Despite the rapid progress of end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition\n(ASR), it has been shown that incorporating external language models (LMs) into\nthe decoding can further improve the recognition performance of E2E ASR\nsystems. To align with the modeling units adopted in E2E ASR systems,\nsubword-level (e.g., characters, BPE) LMs are usually used to cooperate with\ncurrent E2E ASR systems. However, the use of subword-level LMs will ignore the\nword-level information, which may limit the strength of the external LMs in E2E\nASR. Although several methods have been proposed to incorporate word-level\nexternal LMs in E2E ASR, these methods are mainly designed for languages with\nclear word boundaries such as English and cannot be directly applied to\nlanguages like Mandarin, in which each character sequence can have multiple\ncorresponding word sequences. To this end, we propose a novel decoding\nalgorithm where a word-level lattice is constructed on-the-fly to consider all\npossible word sequences for each partial hypothesis. Then, the LM score of the\nhypothesis is obtained by intersecting the generated lattice with an external\nword N-gram LM. The proposed method is examined on both Attention-based\nEncoder-Decoder (AED) and Neural Transducer (NT) frameworks. Experiments\nsuggest that our method consistently outperforms subword-level LMs, including\nN-gram LM and neural network LM. We achieve state-of-the-art results on both\nAishell-1 (CER 4.18%) and Aishell-2 (CER 5.06%) datasets and reduce CER by\n14.8% relatively on a 21K-hour Mandarin dataset.",

    "abstract": "The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for describing\nmetadata, such as attributes and relationships of resources on the Web. Machine\nlearning tasks for RDF graphs adopt three methods: (i) support vector machines\n(SVMs) with RDF graph kernels, (ii) RDF graph embeddings, and (iii) relational\ngraph convolutional networks.

In\norder to make the Skip vector low-dimensional, we select important features for\nclassification tasks based on the information gain ratio of each feature. The\nclassification tasks can be performed by applying the low-dimensional Skip\nvector of each resource to conventional machine learning algorithms, such as\nSVMs, the k-nearest neighbors method, neural networks, random forests, and\nAdaBoost. In our evaluation experiments with RDF data, such as Wikidata,\nDBpedia, and YAGO, we compare our method with RDF graph kernels in an SVM.

The mechanism reduction is\nmodeled as an optimization problem on Boolean space, where a Boolean vector,\neach entry corresponding to a species, represents a reduced mechanism. The\noptimization goal is to minimize the reduced mechanism size given the error\ntolerance of a group of pre-selected benchmark quantities. The key idea of the\nDeePMR is to employ a deep neural network (DNN) to formulate the objective\nfunction in the optimization problem. In order to explore high dimensional\nBoolean space efficiently, an iterative DNN-assisted data sampling and DNN\ntraining procedure are implemented. The results show that DNN-assistance\nimproves sampling efficiency significantly, selecting only $10^5$ samples out\nof $10^{34}$ possible samples for DNN to achieve sufficient accuracy. The\nresults demonstrate the capability of the DNN to recognize key species and\nreasonably predict reduced mechanism performance. The well-trained DNN\nguarantees the optimal reduced mechanism by solving an inverse optimization\nproblem. By comparing ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, temperatures\nin PSRs, the resulting skeletal mechanism has fewer species (45 species) but\nthe same level of accuracy as the skeletal mechanism (56 species) obtained by\nthe Path Flux Analysis (PFA) method. In addition, the skeletal mechanism can be\nfurther reduced to 28 species if only considering atmospheric,\nnear-stoichiometric conditions (equivalence ratio between 0.6 and 1.2).

Extensive\nexperimental results show the value of our approach on various benchmark\ndatasets, including the finance domain.

    "abstract": "In recent years, large pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) have\nrevolutionized the field of computer vision (CV). Although these DNNs have been\nshown to be very well suited for general image recognition tasks, application\nin industry is often precluded for three reasons: 1) large pre-trained DNNs are\nbuilt on hundreds of millions of parameters, making deployment on many devices\nimpossible, 2) the underlying dataset for pre-training consists of general\nobjects, while industrial cases often consist of very specific objects, such as\nstructures on solar wafers, 3) potentially biased pre-trained DNNs raise legal\nissues for companies. As a remedy, we study neural networks for CV that we\ntrain from scratch. For this purpose, we use a real-world case from a solar\nwafer manufacturer. We find that our neural networks achieve similar\nperformances as pre-trained DNNs, even though they consist of far fewer\nparameters and do not rely on third-party datasets.",

A practical\nand efficient channel estimator is developed for CPSC-RIS and the mean square\nerror of the channel estimation is expressed in closed-form. We analyze the bit\nerror rate (BER) performance of CPSC-RIS over frequency-selective Nakagami-$m$\nfading channels. An upper bound on the BER is derived by assuming the\nmaximum-likelihood detection. Furthermore, by resorting to the concept of index\nmodulation (IM), we propose an extension of CPSC-RIS, termed CPSC-RIS-IM, which\nenhances the spectral efficiency. In addition to conventional constellation\ninformation of PSK symbols, CPSC-RIS-IM uses the full permutations of cyclic\ndelays caused by the RIS to carry information. A sub-optimal receiver is\ndesigned for CPSC-RIS-IM to aim at low computational complexity. Our simulation\nresults in terms of BER corroborate the performance analysis and the\nsuperiority of CPSC-RIS(-IM) over the conventional CPSC without an RIS and\northogonal frequency division multiplexing with an RIS.",

First, we propose a novel SFC framework with an abstraction layer\nthat can dynamically create partial or full symmetric SFCs across multiple\nadministrative and technological cloud/edge domains. According to the Key\nPerformance Indicators (KPIs) and desired objectives specified at the network\nslice intent request, the abstraction layer would automatise different SFC\noperations, but specifically generating partial or full symmetric SFCs. Second,\nwe propose an algorithm to dynamically calculate the reverse path for an SFC by\nincluding only SFs requiring symmetry.

In\nthis work, we propose two techniques to develop nonlinear ML models to predict\nthermospheric density while providing calibrated uncertainty estimates: Monte\nCarlo (MC) dropout and direct prediction of the probability distribution, both\nusing the negative logarithm of predictive density (NLPD) loss function. We\nshow the performance for models trained on local and global datasets. This\nshows that NLPD provides similar results for both techniques but the direct\nprobability method has a much lower computational cost. For the global model\nregressed on the SET HASDM density database, we achieve errors of 11% on\nindependent test data with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Using an\nin-situ CHAMP density dataset, both techniques provide test error on the order\nof 13%. The CHAMP models (on independent data) are within 2% of perfect\ncalibration for all prediction intervals tested. This model can also be used to\nobtain global predictions with uncertainties at a given epoch.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a CNN-based fully unsupervised method for motion\nsegmentation from optical flow. We assume that the input optical flow can be\nrepresented as a piecewise set of parametric motion models, typically, affine\nor quadratic motion models.The core idea of this work is to leverage the\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) framework. It enables us to design in a\nwell-founded manner the loss function and the training procedure of our motion\nsegmentation neural network. However, in contrast to the classical iterative\nEM, once the network is trained, we can provide a segmentation for any unseen\noptical flow field in a single inference step, with no dependence on the\ninitialization of the motion model parameters since they are not estimated in\nthe inference stage. Different loss functions have been investigated including\nrobust ones. We also propose a novel data augmentation technique on the optical\nflow field with a noticeable impact on the performance. We tested our motion\nsegmentation network on the DAVIS2016 dataset. Our method outperforms\ncomparable unsupervised methods and is very efficient. Indeed, it can run at\n125fps making it usable for real-time applications.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the massive connectivity of low Earth orbit (LEO)\nsatellite-based Internet-of-Things (IoT) for seamless global coverage. We\npropose to integrate the grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA)\nparadigm with the emerging orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation to\naccommodate the massive IoT access, and mitigate the long round-trip latency\nand severe Doppler effect of terrestrial-satellite links (TSLs). On this basis,\nwe put forward a two-stage successive active terminal identification (ATI) and\nchannel estimation (CE) scheme as well as a low-complexity multi-user signal\ndetection (SD) method. Specifically, at the first stage, the proposed training\nsequence aided OTFS (TS-OTFS) data frame structure facilitates the joint ATI\nand coarse CE, whereby both the traffic sparsity of terrestrial IoT terminals\nand the sparse channel impulse response are leveraged for enhanced performance.\nMoreover, based on the single Doppler shift property for each TSL and sparsity\nof delay-Doppler domain channel, we develop a parametric approach to further\nrefine the CE performance. Finally, a least square based parallel time domain\nSD method is developed to detect the OTFS signals with relatively low\ncomplexity.

    "title": "Deep Causal Reasoning for Recommendations",
    "abstract": "Traditional recommender systems aim to estimate a user's rating to an item\nbased on observed ratings from the population. As with all observational\nstudies, hidden confounders, which are factors that affect both item exposures\nand user ratings, lead to a systematic bias in the estimation. Consequently, a\nnew trend in recommender system research is to negate the influence of\nconfounders from a causal perspective. Observing that confounders in\nrecommendations are usually shared among items and are therefore multi-cause\nconfounders, we model the recommendation as a multi-cause multi-outcome (MCMO)\ninference problem. Specifically, to remedy confounding bias, we estimate\nuser-specific latent variables that render the item exposures independent\nBernoulli trials. The generative distribution is parameterized by a DNN with\nfactorized logistic likelihood and the intractable posteriors are estimated by\nvariational inference. Controlling these factors as substitute confounders,\nunder mild assumptions, can eliminate the bias incurred by multi-cause\nconfounders. Furthermore, we show that MCMO modeling may lead to high variance\ndue to scarce observations associated with the high-dimensional causal space.\nFortunately, we theoretically demonstrate that introducing user features as\npre-treatment variables can substantially improve sample efficiency and\nalleviate overfitting. Empirical studies on simulated and real-world datasets\nshow that the proposed deep causal recommender shows more robustness to\nunobserved confounders than state-of-the-art causal recommenders.

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the analysis of evolution of inter-event times in\nlinear systems under event-triggered control and region-based self-triggered\ncontrol. First, we consider planar systems under control with a class of\nscale-invariant event triggering rules. In this setting, the inter-event time\nis a function of the \"angle\" of the state at an event. We analyze the\nproperties of this inter-event time function such as periodicity and\ncontinuity. Then, we analyze the evolution of the inter-event times by studying\nthe fixed points of the \"angle\" map which represents the evolution of the\n\"angle\" of the state between two successive events. For a specific triggering\nrule, we provide necessary conditions for the convergence of inter-event times\nto a steady state value. We also analyze stability and region of convergence of\na fixed point of the \"angle\" map. Next, we consider n-dimensional systems under\nregion-based self triggered control, in which the state space is partitioned\ninto a finite number of conic regions and each region is associated with a\nfixed inter-event time. We analyze the evolution of inter-event times under the\nproposed self-triggered control method. In this framework, studying steady\nstate behavior of the inter-event times is equivalent to studying the existence\nof a conic subregion, which is a positively invariant set under the map that\ngives the evolution of the state from one event to the next. We provide a\nsufficient condition for the existence of a special kind of positively\ninvariant subregion called positively invariant ray. We also provide necessary\nand sufficient conditions for a positively invariant ray to be asymptotically\nstable. We also explore the existence of positively invariant subregions that\ndo not include a positively invariant ray. We illustrate the proposed method of\nanalysis and analytical results through numerical simulations.",

This imperfection in\nphase control can have a significant impact on the system performance.\nMotivated by this, in this paper, we consider an RIS-assisted uplink NOMA\nsystem in the presence of imperfect phase compensation. We formulate the\ncriterion for pairing the users that achieves minimum required data rates. We\npropose adaptive user pairing algorithms that maximize spectral or energy\nefficiency. We then derive various bounds on power allocation factors for the\npaired users. Through extensive simulation results, we show that the proposed\nalgorithms significantly outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of\nspectral and energy efficiency.",

    "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has gathered much attention recently. Impressive\nresults were achieved in activities as diverse as autonomous driving, game\nplaying, molecular recombination, and robotics. In all these fields, computer\nprograms have taught themselves to solve difficult problems. They have learned\nto fly model helicopters and perform aerobatic manoeuvers such as loops and\nrolls. In some applications they have even become better than the best humans,\nsuch as in Atari, Go, poker and StarCraft. The way in which deep reinforcement\nlearning explores complex environments reminds us of how children learn, by\nplayfully trying out things, getting feedback, and trying again. The computer\nseems to truly possess aspects of human learning; this goes to the heart of the\ndream of artificial intelligence. The successes in research have not gone\nunnoticed by educators, and universities have started to offer courses on the\nsubject. The aim of this book is to provide a comprehensive overview of the\nfield of deep reinforcement learning. The book is written for graduate students\nof artificial intelligence, and for researchers and practitioners who wish to\nbetter understand deep reinforcement learning methods and their challenges. We\nassume an undergraduate-level of understanding of computer science and\nartificial intelligence; the programming language of this book is Python. We\ndescribe the foundations, the algorithms and the applications of deep\nreinforcement learning. We cover the established model-free and model-based\nmethods that form the basis of the field. Developments go quickly, and we also\ncover advanced topics: deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, deep\nhierarchical reinforcement learning, and deep meta learning.",

    "abstract": "Classification of long sequential data is an important Machine Learning task\nand appears in many application scenarios. Recurrent Neural Networks,\nTransformers, and Convolutional Neural Networks are three major techniques for\nlearning from sequential data. Among these methods, Temporal Convolutional\nNetworks (TCNs) which are scalable to very long sequences have achieved\nremarkable progress in time series regression. However, the performance of TCNs\nfor sequence classification is not satisfactory because they use a skewed\nconnection protocol and output classes at the last position. Such asymmetry\nrestricts their performance for classification which depends on the whole\nsequence. In this work, we propose a symmetric multi-scale architecture called\nCircular Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (CDIL-CNN), where every position\nhas an equal chance to receive information from other positions at the previous\nlayers. Our model gives classification logits in all positions, and we can\napply a simple ensemble learning to achieve a better decision. We have tested\nCDIL-CNN on various long sequential datasets.

Soft continuum manipulators do not currently\nconsider dynamic parameters when operating in task space. This shortcoming\nmakes existing soft robots slow and limits their ability to deal with external\nforces, especially during object manipulation. We address this issue by using\ndynamic operational space control. Our control approach takes into account the\ndynamic parameters of the 3D continuum arm and introduces new models that\nenable multi-segment soft manipulators to operate smoothly in task space.\nAdvanced control methods, previously afforded only to rigid robots, are now\nadapted to soft robots; for example, potential field avoidance was previously\nonly shown for rigid robots and is now extended to soft robots. Using our\napproach, a soft manipulator can now achieve a variety of tasks that were\npreviously not possible: we evaluate the manipulator's performance in\nclosed-loop controlled experiments such as pick-and-place, obstacle avoidance,\nthrowing objects using an attached soft gripper, and deliberately applying\nforces to a surface by drawing with a grasped piece of chalk. Besides the newly\nenabled skills, our approach improves tracking accuracy by 59% and increases\nspeed by a factor of 19.3 compared to state of the art for task space control.\nWith these newfound abilities, soft robots can start to challenge rigid robots\nin the field of manipulation.

    "abstract": "Local explainability methods -- those which seek to generate an explanation\nfor each prediction -- are becoming increasingly prevalent due to the need for\npractitioners to rationalize their model outputs. However, comparing local\nexplainability methods is difficult since they each generate outputs in various\nscales and dimensions. Furthermore, due to the stochastic nature of some\nexplainability methods, it is possible for different runs of a method to\nproduce contradictory explanations for a given observation. In this paper, we\npropose a topology-based framework to extract a simplified representation from\na set of local explanations. We do so by first modeling the relationship\nbetween the explanation space and the model predictions as a scalar function.\nThen, we compute the topological skeleton of this function. This topological\nskeleton acts as a signature for such functions, which we use to compare\ndifferent explanation methods. We demonstrate that our framework can not only\nreliably identify differences between explainability techniques but also\nprovides stable representations. Then, we show how our framework can be used to\nidentify appropriate parameters for local explainability methods. Our framework\nis simple, does not require complex optimizations, and can be broadly applied\nto most local explanation methods. We believe the practicality and versatility\nof our approach will help promote topology-based approaches as a tool for\nunderstanding and comparing explanation methods.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) have emerged as an interpretable signed weighted\ndigraph method consisting of nodes (concepts) and weights which represent the\ndependencies among the concepts. Although FCMs have attained considerable\nachievements in various time series prediction applications, designing an FCM\nmodel with time-efficient training method is still an open challenge. Thus,\nthis paper introduces a novel univariate time series forecasting technique,\nwhich is composed of a group of randomized high order FCM models labeled\nR-HFCM. The novelty of the proposed R-HFCM model is relevant to merging the\nconcepts of FCM and Echo State Network (ESN) as an efficient and particular\nfamily of Reservoir Computing (RC) models, where the least squares algorithm is\napplied to train the model. From another perspective, the structure of R-HFCM\nconsists of the input layer, reservoir layer, and output layer in which only\nthe output layer is trainable while the weights of each sub-reservoir\ncomponents are selected randomly and keep constant during the training process.\nAs case studies, this model considers solar energy forecasting with public data\nfor Brazilian solar stations as well as Malaysia dataset, which includes hourly\nelectric load and temperature data of the power supply company of the city of\nJohor in Malaysia. The experiment also includes the effect of the map size,\nactivation function, the presence of bias and the size of the reservoir on the\naccuracy of R-HFCM method. The obtained results confirm the outperformance of\nthe proposed R-HFCM model in comparison to the other methods.

An arm represents an antenna tilt update; the\ncontext captures current network conditions; the reward corresponds to an\nimprovement of performance, mixing coverage and capacity; and the objective is\nto identify, with a given level of confidence, an approximately optimal policy\n(a function mapping the context to an arm with maximal reward). For CL-MAB in\nboth active and passive learning settings, we derive information-theoretical\nlower bounds on the number of samples required by any algorithm returning an\napproximately optimal policy with a given level of certainty, and devise\nalgorithms achieving these fundamental limits. We apply our algorithms to the\nRemote Electrical Tilt (RET) optimization problem in cellular networks, and\nshow that they can produce optimal tilt update policy using much fewer data\nsamples than naive or existing rule-based learning algorithms.",

In\ndata-intensive systems, where data manipulation is a critical functionality,\nthe presence of SATD in the data access logic could seriously harm performance\nand maintainability.

The goal of the\nreward designer is to modify the underlying reward function cost-efficiently\nwhile ensuring that any approximately optimal deterministic policy under the\nnew reward function is admissible and performs well under the original reward\nfunction. This problem can be viewed as a dual to the problem of optimal reward\npoisoning attacks: instead of forcing an agent to adopt a specific policy, the\nreward designer incentivizes an agent to avoid taking actions that are\ninadmissible in certain states. Perhaps surprisingly, and in contrast to the\nproblem of optimal reward poisoning attacks, we first show that the reward\ndesign problem for admissible policy teaching is computationally challenging,\nand it is NP-hard to find an approximately optimal reward modification. We then\nproceed by formulating a surrogate problem whose optimal solution approximates\nthe optimal solution to the reward design problem in our setting, but is more\namenable to optimization techniques and analysis. For this surrogate problem,\nwe present characterization results that provide bounds on the value of the\noptimal solution.

The\ncapsule, as the building block of capsule networks, is a group of neurons\nrepresented by a vector to encode different features of an entity.

Here, we introduce a quantum capsule network (dubbed QCapsNet)\ntogether with a quantum dynamic routing algorithm. Our model enjoys an\nexponential speedup in the dynamic routing process and exhibits an enhanced\nrepresentation power. To benchmark the performance of the QCapsNet, we carry\nout extensive numerical simulations on the classification of handwritten digits\nand symmetry-protected topological phases, and show that the QCapsNet can\nachieve the state-of-the-art accuracy and outperforms conventional quantum\nclassifiers evidently. We further unpack the output capsule state and find that\na particular subspace may correspond to a human-understandable feature of the\ninput data, which indicates the potential explainability of such networks.

    "abstract": "Devising schemes for testing the amount of entanglement in quantum systems\nhas played a crucial role in quantum computing and information theory. Here, we\nstudy the problem of testing whether an unknown state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is a\nmatrix product state (MPS) in the property testing model. MPS are a class of\nphysically-relevant quantum states which arise in the study of quantum\nmany-body systems. A quantum state $|\\psi_{1,...,n}\\rangle$ comprised of $n$\nqudits is said to be an MPS of bond dimension $r$ if the reduced density matrix\n$\\psi_{1,...,k}$ has rank $r$ for each $k \\in \\{1,...,n\\}$. When $r=1$, this\ncorresponds to the set of product states. For larger values of $r$, this yields\na more expressive class of quantum states, which are allowed to possess limited\namounts of entanglement. In the property testing model, one is given $m$\nidentical copies of $|\\psi\\rangle$, and the goal is to determine whether\n$|\\psi\\rangle$ is an MPS of bond dimension $r$ or whether $|\\psi\\rangle$ is far\nfrom all such states. For the case of product states, we study the product\ntest, a simple two-copy test previously analyzed by Harrow and Montanaro (FOCS\n2010), and a key ingredient in their proof that\n$\\mathsf{QMA(2)}=\\mathsf{QMA}(k)$ for $k \\geq 2$. We give a new and simpler\nanalysis of the product test which achieves an optimal bound for a wide range\nof parameters, answering open problems of Harrow and Montanaro (FOCS 2010) and\nMontanaro and de Wolf (2016). For the case of $r\\geq 2$, we give an efficient\nalgorithm for testing whether $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an MPS of bond dimension $r$\nusing $m = O(n r^2)$ copies, independent of the dimensions of the qudits, and\nwe show that $\\Omega(n^{1/2})$ copies are necessary for this task. This lower\nbound shows that a dependence on the number of qudits $n$ is necessary, in\nsharp contrast to the case of product states where a constant number of copies\nsuffices.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, and demyelinating\ndisease that leads to lesions in the central nervous system. This disease can\nbe tracked and diagnosed using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Up to now a\nmultitude of multimodality automatic biomedical approaches is used to segment\nlesions which are not beneficial for patients in terms of cost, time, and\nusability. The authors of the present paper propose a method employing just one\nmodality (FLAIR image) to segment MS lesions accurately. Methods: A patch-based\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed, inspired by 3D-ResNet and\nspatial-channel attention module, to segment MS lesions. The proposed method\nconsists of three stages: (1) the contrast-limited adaptive histogram\nequalization (CLAHE) is applied to the original images and concatenated to the\nextracted edges in order to create 4D images; (2) the patches of size 80 * 80 *\n80 * 2 are randomly selected from the 4D images; and (3) the extracted patches\nare passed into an attention-based CNN which is used to segment the lesions.\nFinally, the proposed method was compared to previous studies of the same\ndataset. Results: The current study evaluates the model, with a test set of\nISIB challenge data. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach\nsignificantly surpasses existing methods in terms of Dice similarity and\nAbsolute Volume Difference while the proposed method use just one modality\n(FLAIR) to segment the lesions. Conclusions: The authors have introduced an\nautomated approach to segment the lesions which is based on, at most, two\nmodalities as an input. The proposed architecture is composed of convolution,\ndeconvolution, and an SCA-VoxRes module as an attention module. The results\nshow, the proposed method outperforms well compare to other methods.",

When applied\nfor osteoporosis screening, it achieves a high classification performance (AUC\n0.963 on lumbar 1).

    "abstract": "An important theoretical problem in the study of quantum computation, that is\nalso practically relevant in the context of near-term quantum devices, is to\nunderstand the computational power of hybrid models, that combine poly-time\nclassical computation with short-depth quantum computation. Here, we consider\ntwo such models: CQ_d which captures the scenario of a polynomial-time\nclassical algorithm that queries a d-depth quantum computer many times; and\nQC_d which is more analogous to measurement-based quantum computation and\ncaptures the scenario of a d-depth quantum computer with the ability to change\nthe sequence of gates being applied depending on measurement outcomes processed\nby a classical computation. Chia, Chung & Lai (STOC 2020) and Coudron & Menda\n(STOC 2020) showed that these models (with d=log^O(1) (n)) are strictly weaker\nthan BQP (the class of problems solvable by poly-time quantum computation),\nrelative to an oracle, disproving a conjecture of Jozsa in the relativised\nworld. We show that, despite the similarities between CQ_d and QC_d, the two\nmodels are incomparable, i.e. CQ_d $\\nsubseteq$ QC_d and QC_d $\\nsubseteq$ CQ_d\nrelative to an oracle. In other words, there exist problems that one model can\nsolve but not the other and vice versa. We do this by considering new oracle\nproblems that capture the distinctions between the two models and by\nintroducing the notion of an intrinsically stochastic oracle, an oracle whose\nresponses are inherently randomised, which is used for our second result. While\nwe leave showing the second separation relative to a standard oracle as an open\nproblem, we believe the notion of stochastic oracles could be of independent\ninterest for studying complexity classes which have resisted separation in the\nstandard oracle model. Our constructions also yield simpler oracle separations\nbetween the hybrid models and BQP, compared to earlier works.",

Combining these approaches\nin a piecemeal way might lead to ad-hoc procedures, and the restricted\ntheoretical conclusions that underpin each individual contribution may no\nlonger be valid. To meet these challenges coherently, in this study, we offer a\nunified robust framework that includes a broad variety of linear prediction\nproblems on a Hilbert space, coupled with a generic class of loss functions.\nNotably, we do not require any assumptions on the distribution of the outlying\ndata points ($\\mathcal{O}$) nor the compactness of the support of the inlying\nones ($\\mathcal{I}$).

A hierarchical model for time\nseries using Bayesian regression has been considered. In this approach, one set\nof parameters is the same for all data samples, other parameters can be\ndifferent for different groups of data samples. Such an approach allows using\nthis model in the case of short historical data for specified time series, e.g.\nin the case of new stores or new products in the sales prediction problem. In\nthe study of predictive models stacking, the models ARIMA, Neural Network,\nRandom Forest, Extra Tree were used for the prediction on the first level of\nmodel ensemble. On the second level, time series predictions of these models on\nthe validation set were used for stacking by Bayesian regression. This approach\ngives distributions for regression coefficients of these models. It makes it\npossible to estimate the uncertainty contributed by each model to stacking\nresult. The information about these distributions allows us to select an\noptimal set of stacking models, taking into account the domain knowledge. The\nprobabilistic approach for stacking predictive models allows us to make risk\nassessment for the predictions that are important in a decision-making process.",

We assume a non-parametric causal\ngraphical model with, possibly, hidden variables and at least one adjustment\nset comprised of observable variables. Moreover, we assume that observable\nvariables have positive costs associated with them. We define the cost of an\nobservable adjustment set as the sum of the costs of the variables that\ncomprise it. We show that in this setting there exist adjustment sets that are\nminimum cost optimal, in the sense that they yield non-parametric estimators of\nthe interventional mean with the smallest asymptotic variance among those that\ncontrol for observable adjustment sets that have minimum cost. Our results are\nbased on the construction of a special flow network associated with the\noriginal causal graph. We show that a minimum cost optimal adjustment set can\nbe found by computing a maximum flow on the network, and then finding the set\nof vertices that are reachable from the source by augmenting paths.

    "abstract": "Wavefront propagation and the appearance of spatially distant clusters of\nactivity generically arise in many contexts including neuron firing, social\ncontagions, epidemics, and critical infrastructure failures. These phenomena\nare in direct competition and represent a frustration between the network's\ngeometry and topology. Here, we extend their study to systems with higher-order\ninteractions by analyzing cascades over noisy geometric complexes, which\ncontain short- and long-range `simplices' that encode dyadic, triadic, and\nhigh-order dependencies. We present a simplicial threshold model (STM) for\ncascades in which a vertex $v_i$ becomes active only when the activity across\nits simplicial neighbors -- including adjacent 1-simplices, 2-simplices, etc.\n-- surpasses a threshold $T_i$. We show that higher-order interactions and\nthresholding can coordinate to robustly guide cascades along a geometric\nsubstrate comprised of lower-adjacent simplices despite the presence of\nlong-range simplices. We explore this phenomenon for a simplicial-complex-based\nmodel of a neuronal network, i.e., a neuronal complex, revealing that\nhigher-order interactions also promote the expressiveness and efficiency of\ndiverse spatio-temporal patterns. We support these findings with bifurcation\ntheory to predict wavefront and clustering dynamics as well as introduce\nsimplicial cascade maps that embed simplicial complexes with a latent geometry\nin which pairwise distances reflect the time required for STM cascades to\ntravel between vertices. Our findings and proposed mathematical tools reveal\nthe dynamical/structural interplay of higher-order nonlinearity and the\nmultidimensional geometry of simplicial complexes to be a fruitful direction\nfor uncovering the multiscale mechanisms that orchestrate higher-order\nprocessing within complex systems.",

While a detailed\nunderstanding of the dynamics of linear autoencoders has recently been\nobtained, the study of non-linear autoencoders has been hindered by the\ntechnical difficulty of handling training data with non-trivial correlations -\na fundamental prerequisite for feature extraction. Here, we study the dynamics\nof feature learning in non-linear, shallow autoencoders. We derive a set of\nasymptotically exact equations that describe the generalisation dynamics of\nautoencoders trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the limit of\nhigh-dimensional inputs. These equations reveal that autoencoders learn the\nleading principal components of their inputs sequentially. An analysis of the\nlong-time dynamics explains the failure of sigmoidal autoencoders to learn with\ntied weights, and highlights the importance of training the bias in ReLU\nautoencoders. Building on previous results for linear networks, we analyse a\nmodification of the vanilla SGD algorithm which allows learning of the exact\nprincipal components. Finally, we show that our equations accurately describe\nthe generalisation dynamics of non-linear autoencoders on realistic datasets\nsuch as CIFAR10.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we study syntactic branching programs of bounded repetition\nrepresenting CNFs of bounded treewidth. For this purpose we introduce two new\nstructural graph parameters $d$-pathwidth and clique preserving $d$-pathwidth\ndenoted by $d-pw(G)$ and $d-cpw(G)$ where $G$ is a graph. We show that\n$2-cpw(G) \\leq O(tw(G) \\Delta(G))$ where $tw(G)$ and $\\Delta(G)$ are,\nrespectively the treewidth and maximal degree of $G$. Using this upper bound,\nwe demonstrate that each CNF $\\psi$ can be represented as a conjunction of two\nOBDDs of size $2^{O(\\Delta(\\psi)*tw(\\psi)^2)}$ where $tw(\\psi)$ is the\ntreewidth of the primal graph of $\\psi$ and each variable occurs in $\\psi$ at\nmost $\\Delta(\\psi)$ times.\nNext we use $d$-pathwdith to obtain lower bounds for monotone branching\nprograms. In particular, we consider the monotone version of syntactic\nnondeterministic read $d$ times branching programs (just forbidding negative\nliterals as edge labels) and introduce a further restriction that each\ncomputational path can be partitioned into at most $d$ read-once subpaths. We\ncall the resulting model separable monotone read $d$ times branching programs\nand abbreviate them $d$-SMNBPs. For each graph $G$ without isolated vertices,\nwe introduce a CNF $\\psi(G)$ whsose clauses are $(u \\vee e \\vee v)$ for each\nedge $e=\\{u,v\\}$ of $G$. We prove that a $d$-SMNBP representing $\\psi(G)$ is of\nsize at least $\\Omega(c^{d-pw(G)})$ where $c=(8/7)^{1/12}$. We use this\n'generic' lower bound to obtain an exponential lower bound for a 'concrete'\nclass of CNFs $\\psi(K_n)$. In particular, we demonstrate that for each $0<a<1$,\nthe size of $n^{a}$-SMNBP representing $\\psi(K_n)$ is at least $c^{n^b}$ where\n$b$ is an arbitrary constant such that $a+b<1$. This lower bound is tight in\nthe sense $\\psi(K_n)$ can be represented by a poly-sized $n$-SMNBP.",
