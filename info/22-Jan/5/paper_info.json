    "abstract": "Machine learning, with its advances in Deep Learning has shown great\npotential in analysing time series in the past. However, in many scenarios,\nadditional information is available that can potentially improve predictions,\nby incorporating it into the learning methods. This is crucial for data that\narises from e.g., sensor networks that contain information about sensor\nlocations. Then, such spatial information can be exploited by modeling it via\ngraph structures, along with the sequential (time) information. Recent advances\nin adapting Deep Learning to graphs have shown promising potential in various\ngraph-related tasks. However, these methods have not been adapted for time\nseries related tasks to a great extent. Specifically, most attempts have\nessentially consolidated around Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for time\nseries forecasting with small sequence lengths. Generally, these architectures\nare not suited for regression or classification tasks that contain large\nsequences of data. Therefore, in this work, we propose an architecture capable\nof processing these long sequences in a multivariate time series regression\ntask, using the benefits of Graph Neural Networks to improve predictions. Our\nmodel is tested on two seismic datasets that contain earthquake waveforms,\nwhere the goal is to predict intensity measurements of ground shaking at a set\nof stations. Our findings demonstrate promising results of our approach, which\nare discussed in depth with an additional ablation study.",

    "abstract": "Corrupted labels and class imbalance are commonly encountered in practically\ncollected training data, which easily leads to over-fitting of deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs). Existing approaches alleviate these issues by adopting a\nsample re-weighting strategy, which is to re-weight sample by designing\nweighting function. However, it is only applicable for training data containing\nonly either one type of data biases. In practice, however, biased samples with\ncorrupted labels and of tailed classes commonly co-exist in training data. How\nto handle them simultaneously is a key but under-explored problem. In this\npaper, we find that these two types of biased samples, though have similar\ntransient loss, have distinguishable trend and characteristics in loss curves,\nwhich could provide valuable priors for sample weight assignment. Motivated by\nthis, we delve into the loss curves and propose a novel probe-and-allocate\ntraining strategy: In the probing stage, we train the network on the whole\nbiased training data without intervention, and record the loss curve of each\nsample as an additional attribute; In the allocating stage, we feed the\nresulting attribute to a newly designed curve-perception network, named\nCurveNet, to learn to identify the bias type of each sample and assign proper\nweights through meta-learning adaptively. The training speed of meta learning\nalso blocks its application. To solve it, we propose a method named skip layer\nmeta optimization (SLMO) to accelerate training speed by skipping the bottom\nlayers.

Existing work has explored the usage of machine learning on\nchannel state information (CSI) computed from Wi-Fi packets to classify events\nof interest. However, most of these algorithms require a significant amount of\ndata collection, as well as extensive computational power for additional CSI\nfeature extraction. Moreover, the majority of these models suffer from poor\naccuracy when tested in a new/untrained environment. In this paper, we propose\nReWiS, a novel framework for robust and environment-independent Wi-Fi sensing.\nThe key innovation of ReWiS is to leverage few-shot learning (FSL) as the\ninference engine, which (i) reduces the need for extensive data collection and\napplication-specific feature extraction; (ii) can rapidly generalize to new\ntasks by leveraging only a few new samples. We prototype ReWiS using\noff-the-shelf Wi-Fi equipment and showcase its performance by considering a\ncompelling use case of human activity recognition. Thus, we perform an\nextensive data collection campaign in three different propagation environments\nwith two human subjects. We evaluate the impact of each diversity component on\nthe performance and compare ReWiS with a traditional convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) approach. Experimental results show that ReWiS improves the\nperformance by about 40% with respect to existing single-antenna low-resolution\napproaches. Moreover, when compared to a CNN-based approach, ReWiS shows a 35%\nmore accuracy and less than 10% drop in accuracy when tested in different\nenvironments, while the CNN drops by more than 45%.",

One of the eventual goals of this approach is to derive results in\ncomputational complexity theory by studying appropriate topological objects\nwhich characterize them. The link which relates these two seemingly separated\nfields is logic, more precisely a subdomain of finite model theory known as\nlogic on words. It allows for a description of complexity classes as certain\nfamilies of languages, possibly non-regular, on a finite alphabet. Very few is\nknown about the duality theory relative to fragments of first-order logic on\nwords which lie outside of the scope of regular languages. The contribution of\nour work is a detailed study of such a fragment. Fixing an integer $k \\geq 1$,\nwe consider the Boolean algebra $\\mathcal{B}\\Sigma_1[\\mathcal{N}^{u}_k]$. It\ncorresponds to the fragment of logic on words consisting in Boolean\ncombinations of sentences defined by using a block of at most $k$ existential\nquantifiers, letter predicates and uniform numerical predicates of arity $l \\in\n\\{1,...,k\\}$. We give a detailed study of the dual space of this Boolean\nalgebra, for any $k \\geq 1$, and provide several characterizations of its\npoints. In the particular case where $k=1$, we are able to construct a family\nof ultrafilter equations which characterize the Boolean algebra $\\mathcal{B}\n\\Sigma_1[\\mathcal{N}^{u}_1]$.

For example, given atomic\ntrajectories from molecular dynamics simulation, the machine's task is to\nquantify dynamical mechanisms that promote function by comparing protein\nmutants, some known to function while others are nonfunctional. Utilizing\nsynthetic two-dimensional molecules that mimic the dynamics of functional and\nnonfunctional proteins, biases are identified and controlled in both the\nmachine learning model and selected training data under different contexts. The\nrefinement of a working hypothesis converges to a statistically robust\nmultivariate perception of the data based on a context-dependent perspective.\nIncluding diverse perspectives during data exploration enhances\ninterpretability of the multivariate characterization of similarities and\ndifferences.",

    "abstract": "In this research, an attention-based depthwise separable neural network with\nBayesian optimization (ADSNN-BO) is proposed to detect and classify rice\ndisease from rice leaf images. Rice diseases frequently result in 20 to 40 \\%\ncorp production loss in yield and is highly related to the global economy.\nRapid disease identification is critical to plan treatment promptly and reduce\nthe corp losses. Rice disease diagnosis is still mainly performed manually. To\nachieve AI assisted rapid and accurate disease detection, we proposed the\nADSNN-BO model based on MobileNet structure and augmented attention mechanism.\nMoreover, Bayesian optimization method is applied to tune hyper-parameters of\nthe model. Cross-validated classification experiments are conducted based on a\npublic rice disease dataset with four categories in total. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that our mobile compatible ADSNN-BO model achieves a test\naccuracy of 94.65\\%, which outperforms all of the state-of-the-art models\ntested. To check the interpretability of our proposed model, feature analysis\nincluding activation map and filters visualization approach are also conducted.\nResults show that our proposed attention-based mechanism can more effectively\nguide the ADSNN-BO model to learn informative features. The outcome of this\nresearch will promote the implementation of artificial intelligence for fast\nplant disease diagnosis and control in the agricultural field.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the following important research question.\nTraditionally, the neural network employs non-linear activation functions\nconcatenated with linear operators to approximate a given physical phenomenon.\nThey \"fill the space\" with the concatenations of the activation functions and\nlinear operators and adjust their coefficients to approximate the physical\nphenomena. We claim that it is better to \"fill the space\" with linear\ncombinations of smooth higher-order B-splines base functions as employed by\nisogeometric analysis and utilize the neural networks to adjust the\ncoefficients of linear combinations. In other words, the possibilities of using\nneural networks for approximating the B-spline base functions' coefficients and\nby approximating the solution directly are evaluated. Solving differential\nequations with neural networks has been proposed by Maziar Raissi et al. in\n2017 by introducing Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINN), which naturally\nencode underlying physical laws as prior information. Approximation of\ncoefficients using a function as an input leverages the well-known capability\nof neural networks being universal function approximators. In essence, in the\nPINN approach the network approximates the value of the given field at a given\npoint. We present an alternative approach, where the physcial quantity is\napproximated as a linear combination of smooth B-spline basis functions, and\nthe neural network approximates the coefficients of B-splines. This research\ncompares results from the DNN approximating the coefficients of the linear\ncombination of B-spline basis functions, with the DNN approximating the\nsolution directly. We show that our approach is cheaper and more accurate when\napproximating smooth physical fields.",

    "abstract": "By executing offloaded tasks from mobile users, edge computing augments\nmobile user equipments (UEs) with computing/communications resources from edge\nnodes (ENs), enabling new services (e.g., real-time gaming). However, despite\nbeing more resourceful than UEs, allocating ENs' resources to a given favorable\nset of users (e.g., closer to ENs) may block other UEs from their services.\nThis is often the case for most existing approaches that only aim to maximize\nthe network social welfare or minimize the total energy consumption but do not\nconsider the computing/battery status of each UE. This work develops an\nenergy-based proportional-fair framework to serve all users with multiple tasks\nwhile considering both their service requirements and energy/battery levels in\na multi-layer edge network. The resulting problem for offloading tasks and\nallocating resources toward the tasks is a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming,\nwhich is NP-hard. To tackle it, we leverage the fact that the relaxed problem\nis convex and propose a distributed algorithm, namely the dynamic\nbranch-and-bound Benders decomposition (DBBD). DBBD decomposes the original\nproblem into a master problem (MP) for the offloading decisions and multiple\nsubproblems (SPs) for resource allocation. To quickly eliminate inefficient\noffloading solutions, MP is integrated with powerful Benders cuts exploiting\nthe ENs' resource constraints. We then develop a dynamic branch-and-bound\nalgorithm (DBB) to efficiently solve MP considering the load balance among ENs.\nSPs can either be solved for their closed-form solutions or be solved in\nparallel at ENs, thus reducing the complexity. The numerical results show that\nDBBD returns the optimal solution in maximizing the proportional fairness among\nUEs. DBBD has higher fairness indexes, i.e., Jain's index and min-max ratio, in\ncomparison with the existing ones that minimize the total consumed energy.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder which results\nin altered behavior, social development, and communication patterns. In past\nyears, autism prevalence has tripled, with 1 in 54 children now affected. Given\nthat traditional diagnosis is a lengthy, labor-intensive process, significant\nattention has been given to developing systems that automatically screen for\nautism. Prosody abnormalities are among the clearest signs of autism, with\naffected children displaying speech idiosyncrasies including echolalia,\nmonotonous intonation, atypical pitch, and irregular linguistic stress\npatterns. In this work, we present a suite of machine learning approaches to\ndetect autism in self-recorded speech audio captured from autistic and\nneurotypical (NT) children in home environments. We consider three methods to\ndetect autism in child speech: first, Random Forests trained on extracted audio\nfeatures (including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients); second, convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) trained on spectrograms; and third, fine-tuned wav2vec\n2.0--a state-of-the-art Transformer-based ASR model. We train our classifiers\non our novel dataset of cellphone-recorded child speech audio curated from\nStanford's Guess What? mobile game, an app designed to crowdsource videos of\nautistic and neurotypical children in a natural home environment. The Random\nForest classifier achieves 70% accuracy, the fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 model\nachieves 77% accuracy, and the CNN achieves 79% accuracy when classifying\nchildren's audio as either ASD or NT. Our models were able to predict autism\nstatus when training on a varied selection of home audio clips with\ninconsistent recording quality, which may be more generalizable to real world\nconditions. These results demonstrate that machine learning methods offer\npromise in detecting autism automatically from speech without specialized\nequipment.",

    "abstract": "Food packing industries typically use seasonal ingredients with immense\nvariety that factory workers manually pack. For small pieces of food picked by\nvolume or weight that tend to get entangled, stick or clump together, it is\ndifficult to predict how intertwined they are from a visual examination, making\nit a challenge to grasp the requisite target mass accurately. Workers rely on a\ncombination of weighing scales and a sequence of complex maneuvers to separate\nout the food and reach the target mass. This makes automation of the process a\nnon-trivial affair. In this study, we propose methods that combines 1)\npre-grasping to reduce the degree of the entanglement, 2) post-grasping to\nadjust the grasped mass using a novel gripper mechanism to carefully discard\nexcess food when the grasped amount is larger than the target mass, and 3)\nselecting the grasping point to grasp an amount likely to be reasonably higher\nthan target grasping mass with confidence. We evaluate the methods on a variety\nof foods that entangle, stick and clump, each of which has a different size,\nshape, and material properties such as volumetric mass density.

    "title": "Semantics-Preserved Distortion for Personal Privacy Protection",
    "abstract": "Privacy protection is an important and concerning topic in Federated\nLearning, especially for Natural Language Processing. In client devices, a\nlarge number of texts containing personal information are produced by users\nevery day. As the direct application of information from users is likely to\ninvade personal privacy, many methods have been proposed in Federated Learning\nto block the center model from the raw information in client devices. In this\npaper, we try to do this more linguistically via distorting the text while\npreserving the semantics. In practice, we leverage a recently proposed metric,\nNeighboring Distribution Divergence, to evaluate the semantic preservation\nduring the distortion. Based on the metric, we propose two frameworks for\nsemantics-preserved distortion, a generative one and a substitutive one. Due to\nthe lack of privacy-related tasks in the current Natural Language Processing\nfield, we conduct experiments on named entity recognition and constituency\nparsing. Results from our experiments show the plausibility and efficiency of\nour distortion as a method for personal privacy protection.",

Such group interactions are ubiquitous in many domains: the sender and\nreceivers of an email, the co-authors of a publication, and the items\nco-purchased by a customer, to name a few. A higher-order interaction (HOI) in\na hypergraph is defined as the co-appearance of a set of nodes in any\nhyperedge. Our focus is the persistence of HOIs repeated over time, which is\nnaturally interpreted as the strength of group relationships, aiming at\nanswering three questions: (a) How do HOIs in real-world hypergraphs persist\nover time? (b) What are the key factors governing the persistence? (c) How\naccurately can we predict the persistence?\nIn order to answer the questions above, we investigate the persistence of\nHOIs in 13 real-world hypergraphs from 6 domains. First, we define how to\nmeasure the persistence of HOIs. Then, we examine global patterns and anomalies\nin the persistence, revealing a power-law relationship. After that, we study\nthe relations between the persistence and 16 structural features of HOIs, some\nof which are closely related to the persistence. Lastly, based on the 16\nstructural features, we assess the predictability of the persistence under\nvarious settings and find strong predictors of the persistence.

Recent\nprogress on the encoder-decoder model attends encoder features mainly in linear\ninteraction with the decoder. However, growing model complexity for visual data\nencourages more explicit feature interaction for fine-grained information,\nwhich is currently absent in the video captioning domain. Moreover, feature\naggregations methods have been used to unveil richer visual representation,\neither by the concatenation or using a linear layer. Though feature sets for a\nvideo semantically overlap to some extent, these approaches result in objective\nmismatch and feature redundancy. In addition, diversity in captions is a\nfundamental component of expressing one event from several meaningful\nperspectives, currently missing in the temporal, i.e., video captioning domain.\nTo this end, we propose Variational Stacked Local Attention Network (VSLAN),\nwhich exploits low-rank bilinear pooling for self-attentive feature interaction\nand stacking multiple video feature streams in a discount fashion. Each feature\nstack's learned attributes contribute to our proposed diversity encoding\nmodule, followed by the decoding query stage to facilitate end-to-end diverse\nand natural captions without any explicit supervision on attributes.

    "abstract": "While information-theoretic methods have been introduced to investigate the\nfundamental control and filtering limitations for a few decades, currently,\nthere is no direct method or trade-off metric to analyze the limitations of\ncontinuous- and discrete-time problems within a unified framework. To answer\nthis challenge, we lift the traditional information-theoretic methods to\ninfinite-dimensional spaces and formulate various control and filtering systems\nuniformly as noisy communication channels. Channel capacity and total\ninformation rate are studied from the perspective of general control and\nfiltering trade-off, and computed from the estimation errors of channel inputs.\nFundamental constraints on the trade-off metrics are derived and used to\ncapture the limitations of continuous-time control and filtering systems. For\nthe control and filtering systems in the linear case, the general trade-offs\nserve as the performance limits related to the characteristics of plant models.\nFor the systems with nonlinear plants, we compute the general trade-offs and\ntheir lower bounds by resorting to the Stratonovich-Kushner equation.",

The\nconvolution of different kernel size networks may overcome this problem by\ncapturing more discriminating and relevant information.

To solve this problem, domain adaptation often provides an\nattractive option given a large amount of labeled data from a similar nature\nbut different domain. Existing approaches mainly align the distributions of\nrepresentations extracted by a single structure and the representations may\nonly contain partial information, e.g., only contain part of the saturation,\nbrightness, and hue information. Along this line, we propose\nMulti-Representation Adaptation which can dramatically improve the\nclassification accuracy for cross-domain image classification and specially\naims to align the distributions of multiple representations extracted by a\nhybrid structure named Inception Adaptation Module (IAM). Based on this, we\npresent Multi-Representation Adaptation Network (MRAN) to accomplish the\ncross-domain image classification task via multi-representation alignment which\ncan capture the information from different aspects. In addition, we extend\nMaximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to compute the adaptation loss.

However, in the practical scenario, labeled data can\nbe typically collected from multiple diverse sources, and they might be\ndifferent not only from the target domain but also from each other. Thus,\ndomain adapters from multiple sources should not be modeled in the same way.\nRecent deep learning based Multi-source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (MUDA)\nalgorithms focus on extracting common domain-invariant representations for all\ndomains by aligning distribution of all pairs of source and target domains in a\ncommon feature space. However, it is often very hard to extract the same\ndomain-invariant representations for all domains in MUDA. In addition, these\nmethods match distributions without considering domain-specific decision\nboundaries between classes. To solve these problems, we propose a new framework\nwith two alignment stages for MUDA which not only respectively aligns the\ndistributions of each pair of source and target domains in multiple specific\nfeature spaces, but also aligns the outputs of classifiers by utilizing the\ndomain-specific decision boundaries.

    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of the e-commerce industry, detecting online\ntransaction fraud in real-world applications has become increasingly important\nto the development of e-commerce platforms. The sequential behavior history of\nusers provides useful information in differentiating fraudulent payments from\nregular ones. Recently, some approaches have been proposed to solve this\nsequence-based fraud detection problem. However, these methods usually suffer\nfrom two problems: the prediction results are difficult to explain and the\nexploitation of the internal information of behaviors is insufficient. To\ntackle the above two problems, we propose a Hierarchical Explainable Network\n(HEN) to model users' behavior sequences, which could not only improve the\nperformance of fraud detection but also make the inference process\ninterpretable. Meanwhile, as e-commerce business expands to new domains, e.g.,\nnew countries or new markets, one major problem for modeling user behavior in\nfraud detection systems is the limitation of data collection, e.g., very few\ndata/labels available. Thus, in this paper, we further propose a transfer\nframework to tackle the cross-domain fraud detection problem, which aims to\ntransfer knowledge from existing domains (source domains) with enough and\nmature data to improve the performance in the new domain (target domain). Our\nproposed method is a general transfer framework that could not only be applied\nupon HEN but also various existing models in the Embedding & MLP paradigm.\nBased on 90 transfer task experiments, we also demonstrate that our transfer\nframework could not only contribute to the cross-domain fraud detection task\nwith HEN, but also be universal and expandable for various existing models.",

Power exchanges can be calculated via a tie-line security\nregion that provides the feasible region of the coupling parameters among\nregional power systems. However, a tie-line security region is a high-dimension\npolytope due to multiple time periods and border buses inherently in power\nsystem operations, leading to the considerable computational burden. A fast\ncalculation method for tie-line security regions in high dimension is studied\nin this paper. The high-dimension polytope across all the time periods is\ndecomposed as a Cartesian production of lower-dimension polytopes at each time\nperiod by leveraging dispatch levels of generations. For each lower-dimension\npolytope, the computational burden brought by multiple border buses is\nalleviated by aggregating tie-line power. Also, minimum renewable curtailments\nare preserved by incorporating an additional dimension in the tie-line security\nregion. For the coupling parameters located within our tie-line security\nregion, a feasible decision of the regional power system exists. Finally, the\ntie-line security region is used to reduce renewable curtailments in an\ninterconnected power system under a decentralized and non-iterative framework.\nThe performance of the presented methods is corroborated in the IEEE 9-bus\nsystem, a 661-bus utility system and a five-region system.",

An\ninterval-valued generalized orthogonal fuzzy group decision-making method is\nproposed based on the Yager operator and CRITIC-WASPAS method with unknown\nweights. The method integrates Yager operator, CRITIC, WASPAS, and interval\nvalue generalized orthogonal fuzzy group. Its merits lie in allowing\ndecision-makers greater freedom, avoiding bias due to decision-makers' weight,\nand yielding accurate evaluation. The research includes: expanding the interval\nvalue generalized distance measurement method for comparison and application of\nsimilarity measurement and decision-making methods; developing a new scoring\nfunction for comparing the size of interval value generalized orthogonal fuzzy\nnumbers,and further existing researches. The proposed interval-valued Yager\nweighted average operator (IVq-ROFYWA) and Yager weighted geometric average\noperator (IVq-ROFYWG) are used for information aggregation. The CRITIC-WASPAS\ncombines the advantages of CRITIC and WASPAS, which not only work in the single\ndecision but also serve as the basis of the group decision. The in-depth study\nof the decision-maker's weight matrix overcomes the shortcomings of taking the\ndecision as a whole, and weighs the decision-maker's information aggregation.\nFinally, the group decision algorithm is used for hypertension risk management.\nThe results are consistent with decision-makers' opinions.

    "abstract": "To this day, a variety of approaches for providing local interpretability of\nblack-box machine learning models have been introduced. Unfortunately, all of\nthese methods suffer from one or more of the following deficiencies: They are\neither difficult to understand themselves, they work on a per-feature basis and\nignore the dependencies between features and/or they only focus on those\nfeatures asserting the decision made by the model. To address these points,\nthis work introduces a reinforcement learning-based approach called Monte Carlo\ntree search for eXplainable Artificial Intelligent (McXai) to explain the\ndecisions of any black-box classification model (classifier). Our method\nleverages Monte Carlo tree search and models the process of generating\nexplanations as two games. In one game, the reward is maximized by finding\nfeature sets that support the decision of the classifier, while in the second\ngame, finding feature sets leading to alternative decisions maximizes the\nreward. The result is a human friendly representation as a tree structure, in\nwhich each node represents a set of features to be studied with smaller\nexplanations at the top of the tree. Our experiments show, that the features\nfound by our method are more informative with respect to classifications than\nthose found by classical approaches like LIME and SHAP. Furthermore, by also\nidentifying misleading features, our approach is able to guide towards improved\nrobustness of the black-box model in many situations.",

    "abstract": "Different self-supervised tasks (SSL) reveal different features from the\ndata. The learned feature representations can exhibit different performance for\neach downstream task. In this light, this work aims to combine Multiple SSL\ntasks (Multi-SSL) that generalizes well for all downstream tasks. Specifically,\nfor this study, we investigate binaural sounds and image data in isolation. For\nbinaural sounds, we propose three SSL tasks namely, spatial alignment, temporal\nsynchronization of foreground objects and binaural audio and temporal gap\nprediction. We investigate several approaches of Multi-SSL and give insights\ninto the downstream task performance on video retrieval, spatial sound super\nresolution, and semantic prediction on the OmniAudio dataset. Our experiments\non binaural sound representations demonstrate that Multi-SSL via incremental\nlearning (IL) of SSL tasks outperforms single SSL task models and fully\nsupervised models in the downstream task performance. As a check of\napplicability on other modality, we also formulate our Multi-SSL models for\nimage representation learning and we use the recently proposed SSL tasks,\nMoCov2 and DenseCL. Here, Multi-SSL surpasses recent methods such as MoCov2,\nDenseCL and DetCo by 2.06%, 3.27% and 1.19% on VOC07 classification and +2.83,\n+1.56 and +1.61 AP on COCO detection.

    "abstract": "For the semantic segmentation of images, state-of-the-art deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) achieve high segmentation accuracy if that task is restricted\nto a closed set of classes. However, as of now DNNs have limited ability to\noperate in an open world, where they are tasked to identify pixels belonging to\nunknown objects and eventually to learn novel classes, incrementally. Humans\nhave the capability to say: I don't know what that is, but I've already seen\nsomething like that. Therefore, it is desirable to perform such an incremental\nlearning task in an unsupervised fashion. We introduce a method where unknown\nobjects are clustered based on visual similarity. Those clusters are utilized\nto define new classes and serve as training data for unsupervised incremental\nlearning. More precisely, the connected components of a predicted semantic\nsegmentation are assessed by a segmentation quality estimate. connected\ncomponents with a low estimated prediction quality are candidates for a\nsubsequent clustering. Additionally, the component-wise quality assessment\nallows for obtaining predicted segmentation masks for the image regions\npotentially containing unknown objects. The respective pixels of such masks are\npseudo-labeled and afterwards used for re-training the DNN, i.e., without the\nuse of ground truth generated by humans.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, named CEMENT, to\novercome the limitations.

    "abstract": "Despite the fact that architectural administration information in Korea has\nbeen providing high-quality information for a long period of time, the level of\nutility of the information is not high because it focuses on administrative\ninformation. While this is the case, a three-dimensional (3D) map with higher\nresolution has emerged along with the technological development. However, it\ncannot function better than visual transmission, as it includes only image\ninformation focusing on the exterior of the building. If information related to\nthe exterior of the building can be extracted or identified from a 3D map, it\nis expected that the utility of the information will be more valuable as the\nnational architectural administration information can then potentially be\nextended to include such information regarding the building exteriors to the\nlevel of BIM(Building Information Modeling). This study aims to present and\nassess a basic method of extracting information related to the appearance of\nthe exterior of a building for the purpose of 3D mapping using deep learning\nand digital image processing. After extracting and preprocessing images from\nthe map, information was identified using the Fast R-CNN(Regions with\nConvolutional Neuron Networks) model. The information was identified using the\nFaster R-CNN model after extracting and preprocessing images from the map. As a\nresult, it showed approximately 93% and 91% accuracy in terms of detecting the\nelevation and window parts of the building, respectively, as well as excellent\nperformance in an experiment aimed at extracting the elevation information of\nthe building.

We consider that\nthere are two gaps involved in existing paradigm:~1) The instance score is not\nwell interrelated with the pose regression quality.~2) The instance feature\nrepresentation, which is used for predicting the instance score, does not\nexplicitly encode the structural pose information to predict the reasonable\nscore that represents pose regression quality. To address the aforementioned\nissues, we propose to learn the pose regression quality-aware representation.\nConcretely, for the first gap, instead of using the previous instance\nconfidence label (e.g., discrete {1,0} or Gaussian representation) to denote\nthe position and confidence for person instance, we firstly introduce the\nConsistent Instance Representation (CIR) that unifies the pose regression\nquality score of instance and the confidence of background into a pixel-wise\nscore map to calibrates the inconsistency between instance score and pose\nregression quality. To fill the second gap, we further present the Query\nEncoding Module (QEM) including the Keypoint Query Encoding (KQE) to encode the\npositional and semantic information for each keypoint and the Pose Query\nEncoding (PQE) which explicitly encodes the predicted structural pose\ninformation to better fit the Consistent Instance Representation (CIR).

Convolutional neural network pays more attention to the\nextraction of local features, therefore it is difficult to extract features of\noccluded pedestrians and the effect is not so satisfied. Recently, vision\ntransformer is introduced into the field of re-identification and achieves the\nmost advanced results by constructing the relationship of global features\nbetween patch sequences. However, the performance of vision transformer in\nextracting local features is inferior to that of convolutional neural network.\nTherefore, we design a partial feature transformer-based person\nre-identification framework named PFT.

We design a learnable tensor with the same size as patch\nsequences, which is full-dimensional and deeply embedded in patch sequences to\nenrich the diversity of training samples. (2) Fusion and reconstruction module.\nWe extract the less important part of obtained patch sequences, and fuse them\nwith original patch sequence to reconstruct the original patch sequences.

    "abstract": "This work proposes a novel model and numerical formulation for lubricated\ncontact problems describing the mutual interaction between two deformable 3D\nsolid bodies and an interposed fluid film. The solid bodies are consistently\ndescribed based on nonlinear continuum mechanics allowing for finite\ndeformations and arbitrary constitutive laws. The fluid film is modelled as a\nquasi-2D flow problem on the interface between the solids governed by the\naveraged Reynolds equation. The averaged Reynolds equation accounts for surface\nroughness utilizing spatially homogenized, effective fluid parameters and for\ncavitation through a positivity constraint imposed on the pressure field. In\ncontrast to existing approaches, the proposed model accounts for the\nco-existence of frictional contact tractions and hydrodynamic fluid tractions\nat every local point on the contact surface of the interacting bodies and\ncovers the entire range from boundary lubrication to mixed, elastohydrodynamic,\nand eventually to full film hydrodynamic lubrication in one unified modelling\nframework with smooth transition between these different regimes. Critically,\nthe model relies on a recently proposed regularization scheme for the\nmechanical contact constraint combining the advantages of classical penalty and\nLagrange multiplier approaches by expressing the mechanical contact pressure as\na function of the effective gap between the solid bodies while at the same time\nlimiting the minimal gap value occurring at the (theoretical) limit of\ninfinitely high contact pressures. From a physical point of view, this approach\ncan be considered as a model for the elastic deformation of surface asperities,\nwith a bounded magnitude depending on the interacting solids' surface\nroughness. A consistent and accurate model behavior is demonstrated and\nvalidated by employing several challenging and practically relevant benchmark\ntest cases.",

    "abstract": "Capturing and simulating intelligent adaptive behaviours within spatially\nexplicit individual-based models remains an ongoing challenge for researchers.\nWhile an ever-increasing abundance of real-world behavioural data are\ncollected, few approaches exist that can quantify and formalise key individual\nbehaviours and how they change over space and time. Consequently, commonly used\nagent decision-making frameworks, such as event-condition-action rules, are\noften required to focus only on a narrow range of behaviours. We argue that\nthese behavioural frameworks often do not reflect real-world scenarios and fail\nto capture how behaviours can develop in response to stimuli. There has been an\nincreased interest in Machine Learning methods and their potential to simulate\nintelligent adaptive behaviours in recent years. One method that is beginning\nto gain traction in this area is Reinforcement Learning (RL). This paper\nexplores how RL can be applied to create emergent agent behaviours using a\nsimple predator-prey Agent-Based Model (ABM). Running a series of simulations,\nwe demonstrate that agents trained using the novel Proximal Policy Optimisation\n(PPO) algorithm behave in ways that exhibit properties of real-world\nintelligent adaptive behaviours, such as hiding, evading and foraging.",

    "abstract": "Transfer-based adversarial example is one of the most important classes of\nblack-box attacks. However, there is a trade-off between transferability and\nimperceptibility of the adversarial perturbation. Prior work in this direction\noften requires a fixed but large $\\ell_p$-norm perturbation budget to reach a\ngood transfer success rate, leading to perceptible adversarial perturbations.\nOn the other hand, most of the current unrestricted adversarial attacks that\naim to generate semantic-preserving perturbations suffer from weaker\ntransferability to the target model. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware\nframework to generate transferable adversarial examples with minimum changes.\nAnalogous to model selection in statistical machine learning, we leverage a\nvalidation model to select the optimal perturbation budget for each image under\nboth the $\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm and unrestricted threat models. Extensive\nexperiments verify the effectiveness of our framework on balancing\nimperceptibility and transferability of the crafted adversarial examples.

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the real structured controllability,\nstabilizability, and stability radii (RSCR, RSSZR, and RSSR, respectively) of\nlinear time invariant systems, i.e., the problems of determining the distance\n(in terms of matrix norms) between a system to its nearest uncontrollable,\nunstabilizable, and unstable systems with a prescribed {\\emph{affine}}\nstructure. The main contributions of this paper lie in two aspects. First,\nassuming that the involved real perturbations have a general affine\nparameterization, we prove that determining the RSCR and RSSZR are NP-hard by\nshowing that even checking their feasibilities are NP-hard. This means the\nhardness results are irrespective of what matrix norm is utilized. The\nNP-hardness of the $2$-norm based RSSR can be obtained from an existing result\nin robust stability analysis. Second, we develop {\\emph{unified}}\nrank-relaxation based algorithms towards these problems, which share two\nnotable features: they are valid both for the Frobenius norm and the $2$-norm\nbased problems, and they share the same framework for the RSCR, RSSZR, and RSSR\nproblems. These algorithms exploit the low-rank structure of the original\nproblems and relax the corresponding rank constraints with a regularized\ntruncated nuclear norm term. This leads to problems of difference of convex\nprograms (DC), which can be solved via the sequential convex relaxations with\nguaranteed convergence to stationary points of the relaxed problems. Moreover,\nunder suitable conditions, a modified version of those algorithms is given to\nfind local optima with performance specification on the corresponding\nperturbations. Finally, simulations suggest that, our proposed methods, though\nin a simple framework, may find local optima as good as several existing\nmethods.",

Gait analysis provides a\nnon-contact, low-cost, and efficient early screening method for depression.\nHowever, the early screening of depression based on gait analysis lacks\nsufficient effective sample data. In this paper, we propose a skeleton data\naugmentation method for assessing the risk of depression. First, we propose\nfive techniques to augment skeleton data and apply them to depression and\nemotion datasets. Then, we divide augmentation methods into two types\n(non-noise augmentation and noise augmentation) based on the mutual information\nand the classification accuracy. Finally, we explore which augmentation\nstrategies can capture the characteristics of human skeleton data more\neffectively. Experimental results show that the augmented training data set\nthat retains more of the raw skeleton data properties determines the\nperformance of the detection model. Specifically, rotation augmentation and\nchannel mask augmentation make the depression detection accuracy reach 92.15%\nand 91.34%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on inferring network structure and community structure\nfrom the dynamics of the nonlinear and complex dynamical systems, which is\nprominent in many fields. Many methods have been proposed to solely address\nthese two problems, but none of them consider explicit shareable knowledge\nacross these two tasks. Inspired by the fact that a more precise network\nstructure may promote the accuracy of community discovery and the better\ncommunities may promote the performance of network reconstruction (NR), this\npaper develops an evolutionary multitasking framework to make full use of\nexplicit shareable knowledge among these two tasks to improve their\nperformance; we refer to this framework as EMTNRCD. In EMTNRCD, we first\nestablish these two tasks as a multitasking NR and community detection (CD)\nproblem where one mission is to reconstruct network structure from dynamics and\nthe other is to discover communities from dynamics. In the process of EMTNRCD,\nthe NR task explicitly transfers several better network structures for the CD\ntask and the CD task explicitly transfers a better community structure to\nassist the NR task, which improves the reconstruction accuracy of the NR task\nand the community division quality of the CD task. Moreover, to transfer\nknowledge from the study of the NR task to the CD task, EMTNRCD models the\nstudy of CD from dynamics as the problem of finding communities in the dynamic\nnetwork and then decides whether to conduct knowledge transfer across tasks.\nThis paper also designs a test suite for multitasking NR and CD problems\n(MTNRCDPs) to verify the performance of EMTNRCD.

These data have important applications ranging\nfrom transportation planning to epidemic modeling. However, issues must be\novercome to best serve these use cases: The data often represent a limited\nsample of the population and use of the data jeopardizes privacy.\nTo address these issues, we present and evaluate a system for generating\nsynthetic mobility data using a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) which is\ntrained on real location data. The system takes a population distribution as\ninput and generates mobility traces for a corresponding synthetic population.\nRelated generative approaches have not solved the challenges of capturing\nboth the patterns and variability in individuals' mobility behaviors over\nlonger time periods, while also balancing the generation of realistic data with\nprivacy. Our system leverages RNNs' ability to generate complex and novel\nsequences while retaining patterns from training data. Also, the model\nintroduces randomness used to calibrate the variation between the synthetic and\nreal data at the individual level. This is to both capture variability in human\nmobility, and protect user privacy.\nLocation based services (LBS) data from more than 22,700 mobile devices were\nused in an experimental evaluation across utility and privacy metrics.

    "abstract": "Learning to optimize the area under the receiver operating characteristics\ncurve (AUC) performance for imbalanced data has attracted much attention in\nrecent years. Although there have been several methods of AUC optimization,\nscaling up AUC optimization is still an open issue due to its pairwise learning\nstyle. Maximizing AUC in the large-scale dataset can be considered as a\nnon-convex and expensive problem. Inspired by the characteristic of pairwise\nlearning, the cheap AUC optimization task with a small-scale dataset sampled\nfrom the large-scale dataset is constructed to promote the AUC accuracy of the\noriginal, large-scale, and expensive AUC optimization task. This paper develops\nan evolutionary multitasking framework (termed EMTAUC) to make full use of\ninformation among the constructed cheap and expensive tasks to obtain higher\nperformance. In EMTAUC, one mission is to optimize AUC from the sampled\ndataset, and the other is to maximize AUC from the original dataset. Moreover,\ndue to the cheap task containing limited knowledge, a strategy for dynamically\nadjusting the data structure of inexpensive tasks is proposed to introduce more\nknowledge into the multitasking AUC optimization environment. The performance\nof the proposed method is evaluated on a series of binary classification\ndatasets. The experimental results demonstrate that EMTAUC is highly\ncompetitive to single task methods and online methods.

One reason for this behavior is the encoded\nsocietal biases in the training data (e.g., females are underrepresented),\nwhich is aggravated in the presence of unbalanced class distributions (e.g.,\n\"granted\" is the minority class). State-of-the-art fairness-aware machine\nlearning approaches focus on preserving the \\emph{overall} classification\naccuracy while improving fairness. In the presence of class-imbalance, such\nmethods may further aggravate the problem of discrimination by denying an\nalready underrepresented group (e.g., \\textit{females}) the fundamental rights\nof equal social privileges (e.g., equal credit opportunity).\nTo this end, we propose AdaFair, a fairness-aware boosting ensemble that\nchanges the data distribution at each round, taking into account not only the\nclass errors but also the fairness-related performance of the model defined\ncumulatively based on the partial ensemble. Except for the in-training boosting\nof the group discriminated over each round, AdaFair directly tackles imbalance\nduring the post-training phase by optimizing the number of ensemble learners\nfor balanced error performance (BER). AdaFair can facilitate different\nparity-based fairness notions and mitigate effectively discriminatory outcomes.\nOur experiments show that our approach can achieve parity in terms of\nstatistical parity, equal opportunity, and disparate mistreatment while\nmaintaining good predictive performance for all classes.",

    "title": "Preventing Cheating in Hands-on Lab Assignments",
    "abstract": "Networking, operating systems, and cybersecurity skills are exercised best in\nan authentic environment. Students work with real systems and tools in a lab\nenvironment and complete assigned tasks. Since all students typically receive\nthe same assignment, they can consult their approach and progress with an\ninstructor, a tutoring system, or their peers. They may also search for\ninformation on the Internet. Having the same assignment for all students in\nclass is standard practice efficient for learning and developing skills.\nHowever, it is prone to cheating when used in a summative assessment such as\ngraded homework, a mid-term test, or a final exam. Students can easily share\nand submit correct answers without completing the assignment. In this paper, we\ndiscuss methods for automatic problem generation for hands-on tasks completed\nin a computer lab environment. Using this approach, each student receives\npersonalized tasks. We developed software for generating and submitting these\npersonalized tasks and conducted a case study. The software was used for\ncreating and grading a homework assignment in an introductory security course\nenrolled by 207 students. The software revealed seven cases of suspicious\nsubmissions, which may constitute cheating. In addition, students and\ninstructors welcomed the personalized assignments. Instructors commented that\nthis approach scales well for large classes. Students rarely encountered issues\nwhile running their personalized lab environment. Finally, we have released the\nopen-source software to enable other educators to use it in their courses and\nlearning environments.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the predictions of deep learning models are formed during\nthe training process is crucial to improve model performance and fix model\ndefects, especially when we need to investigate nontrivial training strategies\nsuch as active learning, and track the root cause of unexpected training\nresults such as performance degeneration.\nIn this work, we propose a time-travelling visual solution DeepVisualInsight\n(DVI), aiming to manifest the spatio-temporal causality while training a deep\nlearning image classifier. The spatio-temporal causality demonstrates how the\ngradient-descent algorithm and various training data sampling techniques can\ninfluence and reshape the layout of learnt input representation and the\nclassification boundaries in consecutive epochs. Such causality allows us to\nobserve and analyze the whole learning process in the visible low dimensional\nspace. Technically, we propose four spatial and temporal properties and design\nour visualization solution to satisfy them. These properties preserve the most\nimportant information when inverse-)projecting input samples between the\nvisible low-dimensional and the invisible high-dimensional space, for causal\nanalyses. Our extensive experiments show that, comparing to baseline\napproaches, we achieve the best visualization performance regarding the\nspatial/temporal properties and visualization efficiency. Moreover, our case\nstudy shows that our visual solution can well reflect the characteristics of\nvarious training scenarios, showing good potential of DVI as a debugging tool\nfor analyzing deep learning training processes.",

    "abstract": "Real economies can be seen as a sequential imperfect-information game with\nmany heterogeneous, interacting strategic agents of various agent types, such\nas consumers, firms, and governments. Dynamic general equilibrium models are\ncommon economic tools to model the economic activity, interactions, and\noutcomes in such systems. However, existing analytical and computational\nmethods struggle to find explicit equilibria when all agents are strategic and\ninteract, while joint learning is unstable and challenging. Amongst others, a\nkey reason is that the actions of one economic agent may change the reward\nfunction of another agent, e.g., a consumer's expendable income changes when\nfirms change prices or governments change taxes. We show that multi-agent deep\nreinforcement learning (RL) can discover stable solutions that are epsilon-Nash\nequilibria for a meta-game over agent types, in economic simulations with many\nagents, through the use of structured learning curricula and efficient GPU-only\nsimulation and training. Conceptually, our approach is more flexible and does\nnot need unrealistic assumptions, e.g., market clearing, that are commonly used\nfor analytical tractability. Our GPU implementation enables training and\nanalyzing economies with a large number of agents within reasonable time\nframes, e.g., training completes within a day. We demonstrate our approach in\nreal-business-cycle models, a representative family of DGE models, with 100\nworker-consumers, 10 firms, and a government who taxes and redistributes. We\nvalidate the learned meta-game epsilon-Nash equilibria through approximate\nbest-response analyses, show that RL policies align with economic intuitions,\nand that our approach is constructive, e.g., by explicitly learning a spectrum\nof meta-game epsilon-Nash equilibria in open RBC models.",

    "abstract": "Over the past several years, legal applications of deep learning have been on\nthe rise. However, as with other high-stakes decision making areas, the\nrequirement for interpretability is of crucial importance. Current models\nutilized by legal practitioners are more of the conventional machine learning\ntype, wherein they are inherently interpretable, yet unable to harness the\nperformance capabilities of data-driven deep learning models. In this work, we\nutilize deep learning models in the area of trademark law to shed light on the\nissue of likelihood of confusion between trademarks. Specifically, we introduce\na model-agnostic interpretable intermediate layer, a technique which proves to\nbe effective for legal documents. Furthermore, we utilize weakly supervised\nlearning by means of a curriculum learning strategy, effectively demonstrating\nthe improved performance of a deep learning model. This is in contrast to the\nconventional models which are only able to utilize the limited number of\nexpensive manually-annotated samples by legal experts. Although the methods\npresented in this work tackles the task of risk of confusion for trademarks, it\nis straightforward to extend them to other fields of law, or more generally, to\nother similar high-stakes application scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In a wide range of practical problems, such as forming operations and impact\ntests, assuming that one of the contacting bodies is rigid is an excellent\napproximation to the physical phenomenon. In this work, the well-established\ndual mortar method is adopted to enforce interface constraints in the finite\ndeformation frictionless contact of rigid and deformable bodies. The efficiency\nof the nonlinear contact algorithm proposed here is based on two main\ncontributions. Firstly, a variational formulation of the method using the\nso-called Petrov-Galerkin scheme is investigated, as it unlocks a significant\nsimplification by removing the need to explicitly evaluate the dual basis\nfunctions. The corresponding first-order dual mortar interpolation is presented\nin detail. Particular focus is, then, placed on the extension for second-order\ninterpolation by employing a piecewise linear interpolation scheme, which\ncritically retains the geometrical information of the finite element mesh.\nSecondly, a new definition for the nodal orthonormal moving frame attached to\neach contact node is suggested. It reduces the geometrical coupling between the\nnodes and consequently decreases the stiffness matrix bandwidth. The proposed\ncontributions decrease the computational complexity of dual mortar methods for\nrigid/deformable interaction, especially in the three-dimensional setting,\nwhile preserving accuracy and robustness.",

By taking advantage of deep neural networks (DNNs), the derived\nDNN-approximated policy is computationally efficient in online implementation.\nThe design procedure of the proposed scheme consists of two sequential\nprocesses: (1) the SL process, in which we first run a simulation with an MPC\nembedding a low-fidelity battery model to generate a training data set, and\nthen, based on the generated data set, we optimize a DNN-approximated policy\nusing SL algorithms; and (2) the RL process, in which we utilize RL algorithms\nto improve the performance of the DNN-approximated policy by balancing\nshort-term economic incentives and long-term battery degradation. The SL\nprocess speeds up the subsequent RL process by providing a good initialization.\nBy utilizing RL algorithms, one prominent property of the proposed scheme is\nthat it can learn from the data generated by simulating the FR policy on the\nhigh-fidelity battery simulator to adjust the DNN-approximated policy, which is\noriginally based on low-fidelity battery model. A case study using real-world\ndata of FR signals and prices is performed.

    "abstract": "Many online platforms today (such as Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, LinkedIn, and\nAirBnB) can be thought of as two-sided markets with producers and customers of\ngoods and services. Traditionally, recommendation services in these platforms\nhave focused on maximizing customer satisfaction by tailoring the results\naccording to the personalized preferences of individual customers. However, our\ninvestigation reinforces the fact that such customer-centric design of these\nservices may lead to unfair distribution of exposure to the producers, which\nmay adversely impact their well-being. On the other hand, a pure\nproducer-centric design might become unfair to the customers. As more and more\npeople are depending on such platforms to earn a living, it is important to\nensure fairness to both producers and customers. In this work, by mapping a\nfair personalized recommendation problem to a constrained version of the\nproblem of fairly allocating indivisible goods, we propose to provide fairness\nguarantees for both sides. Formally, our proposed {\\em FairRec} algorithm\nguarantees Maxi-Min Share ($\\alpha$-MMS) of exposure for the producers, and\nEnvy-Free up to One Item (EF1) fairness for the customers. Extensive\nevaluations over multiple real-world datasets show the effectiveness of {\\em\nFairRec} in ensuring two-sided fairness while incurring a marginal loss in\noverall recommendation quality.

While erosion is often considered rather late, its\nsymptoms can act as early warnings to software developers, if detected in time.\nIn addition to static source code analysis, code reviews can be a source of\ndetecting erosion symptoms and subsequently taking action. In this study, we\ninvestigate the erosion symptoms discussed in code reviews, as well as their\ntrends, and the actions taken by developers. Specifically, we conducted an\nempirical study with the two most active Open Source Software (OSS) projects in\nthe OpenStack community (i.e., Nova and Neutron). We manually checked 21,274\ncode review comments retrieved by keyword search and random selection, and\nidentified 502 code review comments (from 472 discussion threads) that discuss\nerosion. Our findings show that (1) the proportion of erosion symptoms is\nrather low, yet notable in code reviews and the most frequently identified\nerosion symptoms are architectural violation, duplicate functionality, and\ncyclic dependency; (2) the declining trend of the identified erosion symptoms\nin the two OSS projects indicates that the architecture tends to stabilize over\ntime; and (3) most code reviews that identify erosion symptoms have a positive\nimpact on removing erosion symptoms, but a few symptoms still remain and are\nignored by developers. The results suggest that (1) code review provides a\npractical way to reduce erosion symptoms; and (2) analyzing the trend of\nerosion symptoms can help get an insight about the erosion status of software\nsystems, and subsequently avoid the potential risk of architecture erosion.",

    "abstract": "Speech-based inputs have been gaining significant momentum with the\npopularity of smartphones and tablets in our daily lives, since voice is the\nmost easiest and efficient way for human-computer interaction. This paper works\ntowards designing more effective speech-based interfaces to query the\nstructured data in relational databases. We first identify a new task named\nSpeech-to-SQL, which aims to understand the information conveyed by human\nspeech and directly translate it into structured query language (SQL)\nstatements. A naive solution to this problem can work in a cascaded manner,\nthat is, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) component followed by a\ntext-to-SQL component. However, it requires a high-quality ASR system and also\nsuffers from the error compounding problem between the two components,\nresulting in limited performance. To handle these challenges, we further\npropose a novel end-to-end neural architecture named SpeechSQLNet to directly\ntranslate human speech into SQL queries without an external ASR step.\nSpeechSQLNet has the advantage of making full use of the rich linguistic\ninformation presented in speech. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst attempt to directly synthesize SQL based on arbitrary natural language\nquestions, rather than a natural language-based version of SQL or its variants\nwith a limited SQL grammar. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nproblem and model, we further construct a dataset named SpeechQL, by\npiggybacking the widely-used text-to-SQL datasets. Extensive experimental\nevaluations on this dataset show that SpeechSQLNet can directly synthesize\nhigh-quality SQL queries from human speech, outperforming various competitive\ncounterparts as well as the cascaded methods in terms of exact match\naccuracies.",

The\npresence of under-represented classes or groups with sensitive attributes\nresults in concerns about generalization and fairness. Such concerns are\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that large capacity deep nets can perfectly fit\nthe training data and appear to achieve perfect accuracy and fairness during\ntraining, but perform poorly during test. To address these challenges, we\npropose AutoBalance, a bi-level optimization framework that automatically\ndesigns a training loss function to optimize a blend of accuracy and\nfairness-seeking objectives. Specifically, a lower-level problem trains the\nmodel weights, and an upper-level problem tunes the loss function by monitoring\nand optimizing the desired objective over the validation data. Our loss design\nenables personalized treatment for classes/groups by employing a parametric\ncross-entropy loss and individualized data augmentation schemes. We evaluate\nthe benefits and performance of our approach for the application scenarios of\nimbalanced and group-sensitive classification. Extensive empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate the benefits of AutoBalance over state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "This study presents a generalized multiscale nonlocal elasticity theory that\nleverages distributed order fractional calculus to accurately capture\ncoexisting multiscale and nonlocal effects within a macroscopic continuum. The\nnonlocal multiscale behavior is captured via distributed order fractional\nconstitutive relations derived from a nonlocal thermodynamic formulation. The\ngoverning equations of the inhomogeneous continuum are obtained via the\nHamilton principle. As a generalization of the constant order fractional\ncontinuum theory, the distributed order theory can model complex media\ncharacterized by inhomogeneous nonlocality and multiscale effects. In order to\nunderstand the correspondence between microscopic effects and the properties of\nthe continuum, an equivalent mass-spring lattice model is also developed by\ndirect discretization of the distributed order elastic continuum. Detailed\ntheoretical arguments are provided to show the equivalence between the discrete\nand the continuum distributed order models in terms of internal nonlocal\nforces, potential energy distribution, and boundary conditions. These\ntheoretical arguments facilitate the physical interpretation of the role played\nby the distributed order framework within nonlocal elasticity theories. They\nalso highlight the outstanding potential and opportunities offered by this\nmethodology to account for multiscale nonlocal effects. The capabilities of the\nmethodology are also illustrated via a numerical study that highlights the\nexcellent agreement between the displacement profiles and the total potential\nenergy predicted by the two models under various order distributions.\nRemarkably, multiscale effects such as displacement distortion, material\nsoftening, and energy concentration are well captured at continuum level by the\ndistributed order theory.",

Many such methods take the form of\nactor-critic with state-based critics, since centralized training allows access\nto the true system state, which can be useful during training despite not being\navailable at execution time. State-based critics have become a common empirical\nchoice, albeit one which has had limited theoretical justification or analysis.\nIn this paper, we show that state-based critics can introduce bias in the\npolicy gradient estimates, potentially undermining the asymptotic guarantees of\nthe algorithm. We also show that, even if the state-based critics do not\nintroduce any bias, they can still result in a larger gradient variance,\ncontrary to the common intuition.

Tracking disease\nprogression characteristics and patterns of recovery could lead to tremendous\ninsights and more timely treatment or treatment adjustment, as well as better\nresources management in health care systems.\nThe primary objective of this study is to explore the potential of\nlongitudinal audio dynamics for COVID-19 monitoring using sequential deep\nlearning techniques, focusing on prediction of disease progression and,\nespecially, recovery trend prediction. We analysed crowdsourced respiratory\naudio data from 212 individuals over 5 days to 385 days, alongside their\nself-reported COVID-19 test results. We first explore the benefits of capturing\nlongitudinal dynamics of audio biomarkers for COVID-19 detection. The strong\nperformance, yielding an AUC-ROC of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.75 and specificity\nof 0.70, supports the effectiveness of the approach compared to methods that do\nnot leverage longitudinal dynamics. We further examine the predicted disease\nprogression trajectory, which displays high consistency with the longitudinal\ntest results with a correlation of 0.76 in the test cohort, and 0.86 in a\nsubset of the test cohort with 12 participants who report disease recovery.\nOur findings suggest that monitoring COVID-19 progression via longitudinal\naudio data has enormous potential in the tracking of individuals' disease\nprogression and recovery.",

Current neural network models compute\ncontinuous-valued data. Information is compressed into dense, distributed\nembeddings. By stark contrast, humans use discrete symbols in their\ncommunication with language. Such symbols represent a compressed version of the\nworld that derives its meaning from shared contextual information.\nAdditionally, human reasoning involves symbol manipulation at a cognitive\nlevel, which facilitates abstract reasoning, the composition of knowledge and\nunderstanding, generalization and efficient learning.

    "abstract": "Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown incredible performance in\nperceptive and control tasks, several trustworthy issues are still open. One of\nthe most discussed topics is the existence of adversarial perturbations, which\nhas opened an interesting research line on provable techniques capable of\nquantifying the robustness of a given input. In this regard, the Euclidean\ndistance of the input from the classification boundary denotes a well-proved\nrobustness assessment as the minimal affordable adversarial perturbation.\nUnfortunately, computing such a distance is highly complex due the non-convex\nnature of NNs. Despite several methods have been proposed to address this\nissue, to the best of our knowledge, no provable results have been presented to\nestimate and bound the error committed. This paper addresses this issue by\nproposing two lightweight strategies to find the minimal adversarial\nperturbation. Differently from the state-of-the-art, the proposed approach\nallows formulating an error estimation theory of the approximate distance with\nrespect to the theoretical one. Finally, a substantial set of experiments is\nreported to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and support the\ntheoretical findings. The obtained results show that the proposed strategies\napproximate the theoretical distance for samples close to the classification\nboundary, leading to provable robustness guarantees against any adversarial\nattacks.",

Students could also access human feedback\nfrom traditional labs. We gathered quantitative data on engagement and\nachievement which allowed us to split the cohort into 6 groups. We then ran\ninterviews with students after the end of the module to produce qualitative\ndata on perceptions of what feedback is, how useful it is, the uses made of it,\nand how it bears on engagement. A general finding was that human and automated\nfeedback are different but complementary. However there are different feedback\nneeds by group.

To this end, we present LSF-SAC,\na novel framework that features a variational inference-based\ninformation-sharing mechanism as extra state information to assist individual\nagents in the value function factorization. We demonstrate that such latent\nindividual state information sharing can significantly expand the power of\nvalue function factorization, while fully decentralized execution can still be\nmaintained in LSF-SAC through a soft-actor-critic design. We evaluate LSF-SAC\non the StarCraft II micromanagement challenge and demonstrate that it\noutperforms several state-of-the-art methods in challenging collaborative\ntasks. We further set extensive ablation studies for locating the key factors\naccounting for its performance improvements.

Although commonly used eXplainable AI methods\nprovide some insight into opaque algorithms, such explanations are usually\nconvoluted and not readily comprehensible except by highly trained experts. The\nexplanation of decisions regarding the malignancy of skin lesions from\ndermoscopic images demands particular clarity, as the underlying medical\nproblem definition is itself ambiguous. This work presents ExAID (Explainable\nAI for Dermatology), a novel framework for biomedical image analysis, providing\nmulti-modal concept-based explanations consisting of easy-to-understand textual\nexplanations supplemented by visual maps justifying the predictions. ExAID\nrelies on Concept Activation Vectors to map human concepts to those learnt by\narbitrary Deep Learning models in latent space, and Concept Localization Maps\nto highlight concepts in the input space. This identification of relevant\nconcepts is then used to construct fine-grained textual explanations\nsupplemented by concept-wise location information to provide comprehensive and\ncoherent multi-modal explanations. All information is comprehensively presented\nin a diagnostic interface for use in clinical routines. An educational mode\nprovides dataset-level explanation statistics and tools for data and model\nexploration to aid medical research and education. Through rigorous\nquantitative and qualitative evaluation of ExAID, we show the utility of\nmulti-modal explanations for CAD-assisted scenarios even in case of wrong\npredictions.

Recently, deep\nlearning techniques have been successfully applied for detection of diabetic\nretinopathy (DR). The main obstacle of applying deep learning techniques to\ndetect most other retinal vascular diseases is the limited amount of data\navailable. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning technique that aims to\nutilize the feature similarities for detecting retinal vascular diseases. We\nchoose the well-studied DR detection as a source task and identify the early\ndetection of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) as the target task. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that our DR-pretrained approach dominates in\nall metrics the conventional ImageNet-pretrained transfer learning approach,\ncurrently adopted in medical image analysis. Moreover, our approach is more\nrobust with respect to the stochasticity in the training process and with\nrespect to reduced training samples.

This work proposes to tackle the explore-vs-exploit dilemma\nusing a multi-stage approach that explicitly disentangles these two strategies\nwithin each episode. Our algorithm, called eXploit-Then-eXplore (XTX), begins\neach episode using an exploitation policy that imitates a set of promising\ntrajectories from the past, and then switches over to an exploration policy\naimed at discovering novel actions that lead to unseen state spaces. This\npolicy decomposition allows us to combine global decisions about which parts of\nthe game space to return to with curiosity-based local exploration in that\nspace, motivated by how a human may approach these games. Our method\nsignificantly outperforms prior approaches by 27% and 11% average normalized\nscore over 12 games from the Jericho benchmark (Hausknecht et al., 2020) in\nboth deterministic and stochastic settings, respectively.

First, we argue that separating\nbetween UAVs and UEs in terms of the assigned sub-carriers reduces the\ninterference impact on the users. This is materialized through a matching game.\nMoreover, in order to boost the partition, we propose a coalitional game that\nconsiders the outcome of the first one and enables users to change their\ncoalitions and enhance their QoS.

One of the biggest drawbacks of the\nsuffix array is that it is very difficult to maintain under text updates: even\na single character substitution can completely change the contents of the\nsuffix array. Thus, the suffix array of a dynamic text is modelled using suffix\narray queries, which return the value $SA[i]$ given any $i\\in[1..n]$.\nPrior to this work, the fastest dynamic suffix array implementations were by\nAmir and Boneh. At ISAAC 2020, they showed how to answer suffix array queries\nin $\\tilde{O}(k)$ time, where $k\\in[1..n]$ is a trade-off parameter, with\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{n}{k})$-time text updates. In a very recent preprint [2021],\nthey also provided a solution with $O(\\log^5 n)$-time queries and\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$-time updates.\nWe propose the first data structure that supports both suffix array queries\nand text updates in $O({\\rm polylog}\\,n)$ time (achieving $O(\\log^4 n)$ and\n$O(\\log^{3+o(1)} n)$ time, respectively). Our data structure is deterministic\nand the running times for all operations are worst-case. In addition to the\nstandard single-character edits (character insertions, deletions, and\nsubstitutions), we support (also in $O(\\log^{3+o(1)} n)$ time) the \"cut-paste\"\noperation that moves any (arbitrarily long) substring of $T$ to any place in\n$T$. We complement our structure by a hardness result: unless the Online\nMatrix-Vector Multiplication (OMv) Conjecture fails, no data structure with\n$O({\\rm polylog}\\,n)$-time suffix array queries can support the \"copy-paste\"\noperation in $O(n^{1-\\epsilon})$ time for any $\\epsilon>0$.",

    "abstract": "Conventional machine learning (ML) relies heavily on manual design from\nmachine learning experts to decide learning tasks, data, models, optimization\nalgorithms, and evaluation metrics, which is labor-intensive, time-consuming,\nand cannot learn autonomously like humans. In education science, self-directed\nlearning, where human learners select learning tasks and materials on their own\nwithout requiring hands-on guidance, has been shown to be more effective than\npassive teacher-guided learning. Inspired by the concept of self-directed human\nlearning, we introduce the principal concept of Self-directed Machine Learning\n(SDML) and propose a framework for SDML. Specifically, we design SDML as a\nself-directed learning process guided by self-awareness, including internal\nawareness and external awareness. Our proposed SDML process benefits from self\ntask selection, self data selection, self model selection, self optimization\nstrategy selection and self evaluation metric selection through self-awareness\nwithout human guidance. Meanwhile, the learning performance of the SDML process\nserves as feedback to further improve self-awareness. We propose a mathematical\nformulation for SDML based on multi-level optimization. Furthermore, we present\ncase studies together with potential applications of SDML, followed by\ndiscussing future research directions. We expect that SDML could enable\nmachines to conduct human-like self-directed learning and provide a new\nperspective towards artificial general intelligence.",

Although\nvarious techniques have been proposed for LF acquisition, achieving both\nangularly and spatially high-resolution LF remains a technology challenge. In\nthis paper, a learning-based approach applied to 3D epipolar image (EPI) is\nproposed to reconstruct high-resolution LF. Through a 2-stage super-resolution\nframework, the proposed approach effectively addresses various LF\nsuper-resolution (SR) problems, i.e., spatial SR, angular SR, and\nangular-spatial SR. While the first stage provides flexible options to\nup-sample EPI volume to the desired resolution, the second stage, which\nconsists of a novel EPI volume-based refinement network (EVRN), substantially\nenhances the quality of the high-resolution EPI volume. An extensive evaluation\non 90 challenging synthetic and real-world light field scenes from 7 published\ndatasets shows that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nto a large extend for both spatial and angular super-resolution problem, i.e.,\nan average peak signal to noise ratio improvement of more than 2.0 dB, 1.4 dB,\nand 3.14 dB in spatial SR $\\times 2$, spatial SR $\\times 4$, and angular SR\nrespectively.

    "abstract": "Occlusion between different objects is a typical challenge in Multi-Object\nTracking (MOT), which often leads to inferior tracking results due to the\nmissing detected objects. The common practice in multi-object tracking is\nre-identifying the missed objects after their reappearance. Though tracking\nperformance can be boosted by the re-identification, the annotation of identity\nis required to train the model. In addition, such practice of re-identification\nstill can not track those highly occluded objects when they are missed by the\ndetector. In this paper, we focus on online multi-object tracking and design\ntwo novel modules, the unsupervised re-identification learning module and the\nocclusion estimation module, to handle these problems. Specifically, the\nproposed unsupervised re-identification learning module does not require any\n(pseudo) identity information nor suffer from the scalability issue. The\nproposed occlusion estimation module tries to predict the locations where\nocclusions happen, which are used to estimate the positions of missed objects\nby the detector. Our study shows that, when applied to state-of-the-art MOT\nmethods, the proposed unsupervised re-identification learning is comparable to\nsupervised re-identification learning, and the tracking performance is further\nimproved by the proposed occlusion estimation module.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy has been a significant tool to observe long-term\nimaging of embryos (in vivo) growth over time. However, cumulative exposure is\nphototoxic to such sensitive live samples. While techniques like light-sheet\nfluorescence microscopy (LSFM) allow for reduced exposure, it is not well\nsuited for deep imaging models. Other computational techniques are\ncomputationally expensive and often lack restoration quality. To address this\nchallenge, one can use various low-dosage imaging techniques that are developed\nto achieve the 3D volume reconstruction using a few slices in the axial\ndirection (z-axis); however, they often lack restoration quality. Also,\nacquiring dense images (with small steps) in the axial direction is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this challenge, we present a compressive\nsensing (CS) based approach to fully reconstruct 3D volumes with the same\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with less than half of the excitation dosage. We\npresent the theory and experimentally validate the approach. To demonstrate our\ntechnique, we capture a 3D volume of the RFP labeled neurons in the zebrafish\nembryo spinal cord (30um thickness) with the axial sampling of 0.1um using a\nconfocal microscope. From the results, we observe the CS-based approach\nachieves accurate 3D volume reconstruction from less than 20% of the entire\nstack optical sections. The developed CS-based methodology in this work can be\neasily applied to other deep imaging modalities such as two-photon and\nlight-sheet microscopy, where reducing sample photo-toxicity is a critical\nchallenge.",

Given a\nmodel distribution $p(x, y)$, with the observation $y$ and the target $x$, one\ncomputes generative classifiers by firstly considering $p(x, y)$ and then using\nthe Bayes rule to calculate $p(x | y)$. A discriminative model is directly\ngiven by $p(x | y)$, which is used to compute discriminative classifiers.\nHowever, recent works showed that the Bayesian Maximum Posterior classifier\ndefined from the Naive Bayes (NB) or Hidden Markov Chain (HMC), both generative\nmodels, can also match the discriminative classifier definition. Thus, there\nare situations in which dividing classifiers into \"generative\" and\n\"discriminative\" is somewhat misleading. Indeed, such a distinction is rather\nrelated to the way of computing classifiers, not to the classifiers themselves.\nWe present a general theoretical result specifying how a generative classifier\ninduced from a generative model can also be computed in a discriminative way\nfrom the same model. Examples of NB and HMC are found again as particular\ncases, and we apply the general result to two original extensions of NB, and\ntwo extensions of HMC, one of which being original.

Extracapsular extension (ECE)\nis a strong predictor of patients' survival outcomes with HNSCC. It is\nessential to detect the occurrence of ECE as it changes staging and management\nfor the patients. Current clinical ECE detection relies on visual\nidentification and pathologic confirmation conducted by radiologists. Machine\nlearning (ML)-based ECE diagnosis has shown high potential in the recent years.\nHowever, manual annotation of lymph node region is a required data\npreprocessing step in most of the current ML-based ECE diagnosis studies. In\naddition, this manual annotation process is time-consuming, labor-intensive,\nand error-prone. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Gradient Mapping Guided\nExplainable Network (GMGENet) framework to perform ECE identification\nautomatically without requiring annotated lymph node region information. The\ngradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) technique is proposed to\nguide the deep learning algorithm to focus on the regions that are highly\nrelated to ECE. Informative volumes of interest (VOIs) are extracted without\nlabeled lymph node region information. In evaluation, the proposed method is\nwell-trained and tested using cross validation, achieving test accuracy and AUC\nof 90.2% and 91.1%, respectively.

    "abstract": "The spleen is one of the most commonly injured solid organs in blunt\nabdominal trauma. The development of automatic segmentation systems from\nmulti-phase CT for splenic vascular injury can augment severity grading for\nimproving clinical decision support and outcome prediction. However, accurate\nsegmentation of splenic vascular injury is challenging for the following\nreasons: 1) Splenic vascular injury can be highly variant in shape, texture,\nsize, and overall appearance; and 2) Data acquisition is a complex and\nexpensive procedure that requires intensive efforts from both data scientists\nand radiologists, which makes large-scale well-annotated datasets hard to\nacquire in general.\nIn light of these challenges, we hereby design a novel framework for\nmulti-phase splenic vascular injury segmentation, especially with limited data.\nOn the one hand, we propose to leverage external data to mine pseudo splenic\nmasks as the spatial attention, dubbed external attention, for guiding the\nsegmentation of splenic vascular injury. On the other hand, we develop a\nsynthetic phase augmentation module, which builds upon generative adversarial\nnetworks, for populating the internal data by fully leveraging the relation\nbetween different phases. By jointly enforcing external attention and\npopulating internal data representation during training, our proposed method\noutperforms other competing methods and substantially improves the popular\nDeepLab-v3+ baseline by more than 7% in terms of average DSC, which confirms\nits effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Computer assisted diagnosis in digital pathology is becoming ubiquitous as it\ncan provide more efficient and objective healthcare diagnostics. Recent\nadvances have shown that the convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures,\na well-established deep learning paradigm, can be used to design a Computer\nAided Diagnostic (CAD) System for breast cancer detection. However, the\nchallenges due to stain variability and the effect of stain normalization with\nsuch deep learning frameworks are yet to be well explored. Moreover,\nperformance analysis with arguably more efficient network models, which may be\nimportant for high throughput screening, is also not well explored.To address\nthis challenge, we consider some contemporary CNN models for binary\nclassification of breast histopathology images that involves (1) the data\npreprocessing with stain normalized images using an adaptive colour\ndeconvolution (ACD) based color normalization algorithm to handle the stain\nvariabilities; and (2) applying transfer learning based training of some\narguably more efficient CNN models, namely Visual Geometry Group Network\n(VGG16), MobileNet and EfficientNet. We have validated the trained CNN networks\non a publicly available BreaKHis dataset, for 200x and 400x magnified\nhistopathology images. The experimental analysis shows that pretrained networks\nin most cases yield better quality results on data augmented breast\nhistopathology images with stain normalization, than the case without stain\nnormalization. Further, we evaluated the performance and efficiency of popular\nlightweight networks using stain normalized images and found that EfficientNet\noutperforms VGG16 and MobileNet in terms of test accuracy and F1 Score.

    "abstract": "Infrared small target super-resolution (SR) aims to recover reliable and\ndetailed high-resolution image with highcontrast targets from its\nlow-resolution counterparts. Since the infrared small target lacks color and\nfine structure information, it is significant to exploit the supplementary\ninformation among sequence images to enhance the target. In this paper, we\npropose the first infrared small target SR method named local motion and\ncontrast prior driven deep network (MoCoPnet) to integrate the domain knowledge\nof infrared small target into deep network, which can mitigate the intrinsic\nfeature scarcity of infrared small targets. Specifically, motivated by the\nlocal motion prior in the spatio-temporal dimension, we propose a local\nspatiotemporal attention module to perform implicit frame alignment and\nincorporate the local spatio-temporal information to enhance the local features\n(especially for small targets). Motivated by the local contrast prior in the\nspatial dimension, we propose a central difference residual group to\nincorporate the central difference convolution into the feature extraction\nbackbone, which can achieve center-oriented gradient-aware feature extraction\nto further improve the target contrast. Extensive experiments have demonstrated\nthat our method can recover accurate spatial dependency and improve the target\ncontrast. Comparative results show that MoCoPnet can outperform the\nstate-of-the-art video SR and single image SR methods in terms of both SR\nperformance and target enhancement. Based on the SR results, we further\ninvestigate the influence of SR on infrared small target detection and the\nexperimental results demonstrate that MoCoPnet promotes the detection\nperformance.

Predicting the hosts of prokaryotic viruses helps\ndecipher the dynamic relationship between microbes.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we discover two factors that inhibit POMs from achieving high\nperceptual quality: 1) center-oriented optimization (COO) problem and 2)\nmodel's low-frequency tendency. First, POMs tend to generate an SR image whose\nposition in the feature space is closest to the distribution center of all\npotential high-resolution (HR) images, resulting in such POMs losing\nhigh-frequency details. Second, $90\\%$ area of an image consists of\nlow-frequency signals; in contrast, human perception relies on an image's\nhigh-frequency details. However, POMs apply the same calculation to process\ndifferent-frequency areas, so that POMs tend to restore the low-frequency\nregions. Based on these two factors, we propose a Detail Enhanced Contrastive\nLoss (DECLoss), by combining a high-frequency enhancement module and spatial\ncontrastive learning module, to reduce the influence of the COO problem and\nlow-Frequency tendency. Experimental results show the efficiency and\neffectiveness when applying DECLoss on several regular SR models. E.g, in EDSR,\nour proposed method achieves 3.60$\\times$ faster learning speed compared to a\nGAN-based method with a subtle degradation in visual quality. In addition, our\nfinal results show that an SR network equipped with our DECLoss generates more\nrealistic and visually pleasing textures compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n%The source code of the proposed method is included in the supplementary\nmaterial and will be made publicly available in the future.",

    "title": "Gaussian Process Regression in the Flat Limit",
    "abstract": "Gaussian process (GP) regression is a fundamental tool in Bayesian\nstatistics. It is also known as kriging and is the Bayesian counterpart to the\nfrequentist kernel ridge regression. Most of the theoretical work on GP\nregression has focused on a large-$n$ asymptotics, characterising the behaviour\nof GP regression as the amount of data increases. Fixed-sample analysis is much\nmore difficult outside of simple cases, such as locations on a regular grid. In\nthis work we perform a fixed-sample analysis that was first studied in the\ncontext of approximation theory by Driscoll & Fornberg (2002), called the \"flat\nlimit\". In flat-limit asymptotics, the goal is to characterise kernel methods\nas the length-scale of the kernel function tends to infinity, so that kernels\nappear flat over the range of the data. Surprisingly, this limit is\nwell-defined, and displays interesting behaviour: Driscoll & Fornberg showed\nthat radial basis interpolation converges in the flat limit to polynomial\ninterpolation, if the kernel is Gaussian. Leveraging recent results on the\nspectral behaviour of kernel matrices in the flat limit, we study the flat\nlimit of Gaussian process regression. Results show that Gaussian process\nregression tends in the flat limit to (multivariate) polynomial regression, or\n(polyharmonic) spline regression, depending on the kernel. Importantly, this\nholds for both the predictive mean and the predictive variance, so that the\nposterior predictive distributions become equivalent. Our results have\npractical consequences: for instance, they show that optimal GP predictions in\nthe sense of leave-one-out loss may occur at very large length-scales, which\nwould be invisible to current implementations because of numerical\ndifficulties.",

Our technique is based on a double-loop inexact accelerated\nproximal gradient (APG) method for minimizing the summation of a non-smooth but\nproximable convex function and two smooth convex functions with different\nsmoothness constants and computational costs. Compared to the standard APG\nmethod, the inexact APG method can reduce the total computation cost if one\nsmooth component has higher computational cost but a smaller smoothness\nconstant than the other. With this property, the inexact APG method can be\napplied to approximately solve the subproblems of a proximal augmented\nLagrangian method for affine-constrained composite convex optimization and the\nsmooth approximation for bilinear saddle-point structured non-smooth convex\noptimization, where the smooth function with a smaller smoothness constant has\nsignificantly higher computational cost.

We explore\nthe model performance and uncertainty calibration for a variety of different\nweight priors and suggest that a sparse prior produces more well-calibrated\nuncertainty estimates. Using the posterior distributions for individual\nweights, we show that we can prune 30% of the fully-connected layer weights\nwithout significant loss of performance by removing the weights with the lowest\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We demonstrate that a larger degree of pruning can\nbe achieved using a Fisher information based ranking, but we note that both\npruning methods affect the uncertainty calibration for Fanaroff-Riley type I\nand type II radio galaxies differently. Finally we show that, like other work\nin this field, we experience a cold posterior effect, whereby the posterior\nmust be down-weighted to achieve good predictive performance. We examine\nwhether adapting the cost function to accommodate model misspecification can\ncompensate for this effect, but find that it does not make a significant\ndifference.

    "abstract": "Recent work has begun to explore the potential of parametrized quantum\ncircuits (PQCs) as general function approximators. In this work, we propose a\nquantum-classical deep network structure to enhance classical CNN model\ndiscriminability. The convolutional layer uses linear filters to scan the input\ndata. Moreover, we build PQC, which is a more potent function approximator,\nwith more complex structures to capture the features within the receptive\nfield. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the PQCs over the input in a\nsimilar way as CNN. We also give a training algorithm for the proposed model.\nThe hybrid models used in our design are validated by numerical simulation. We\ndemonstrate the reasonable classification performances on MNIST and we compare\nthe performances with models in different settings. The results disclose that\nthe model with ansatz in high expressibility achieves lower cost and higher\naccuracy.",

    "title": "Swin UNETR: Swin Transformers for Semantic Segmentation of Brain Tumors  in MRI Images",
    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of brain tumors is a fundamental medical image analysis\ntask involving multiple MRI imaging modalities that can assist clinicians in\ndiagnosing the patient and successively studying the progression of the\nmalignant entity. In recent years, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs)\napproaches have become the de facto standard for 3D medical image segmentation.\nThe popular \"U-shaped\" network architecture has achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance benchmarks on different 2D and 3D semantic segmentation tasks and\nacross various imaging modalities. However, due to the limited kernel size of\nconvolution layers in FCNNs, their performance of modeling long-range\ninformation is sub-optimal, and this can lead to deficiencies in the\nsegmentation of tumors with variable sizes. On the other hand, transformer\nmodels have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such long-range\ninformation in multiple domains, including natural language processing and\ncomputer vision. Inspired by the success of vision transformers and their\nvariants, we propose a novel segmentation model termed Swin UNEt TRansformers\n(Swin UNETR). Specifically, the task of 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation is\nreformulated as a sequence to sequence prediction problem wherein multi-modal\ninput data is projected into a 1D sequence of embedding and used as an input to\na hierarchical Swin transformer as the encoder. The swin transformer encoder\nextracts features at five different resolutions by utilizing shifted windows\nfor computing self-attention and is connected to an FCNN-based decoder at each\nresolution via skip connections. We have participated in BraTS 2021\nsegmentation challenge, and our proposed model ranks among the top-performing\napproaches in the validation phase. Code: https://monai.io/research/swin-unetr",

    "abstract": "Organizational network analysis (ONA) is a method for studying interactions\nwithin formal organizations. The utility of ONA has grown substantially over\nthe years as means to analyze the relationships developed within and between\nteams, departments, and other organizational units. The mapping and quantifying\nof these relationships have been shown to provide insight into the exchange of\ninformation and resources, the building of social capital, and the spread of\nculture within and between organizations. However, the ethical concerns\nregarding personally identifiable information (PII) that exist for traditional\nsocial science research are made more pertinent in ONA, as the relational\nnature of the network may leave participants open to identification by\norganization management. To address this, we propose a method of generating a\nnetwork of organizational groups (e.g. units, departments, teams) through the\nprojection of ego-networks absent of PII. We validate this method through\nmodular analysis of the resulting networks and compare the identified structure\nto a known structure of the organization. The methodology lays a foundation for\nperforming ONA that needs only anonymous ego-centric data to identify\nlarge-scale aspects of organizational structures.",
