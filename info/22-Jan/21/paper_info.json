    "title": "On Using Blockchains for Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) Drones  Operation: An Architectural Study",
    "abstract": "Beyond Visual Line of Sight operation enables drones to surpass the limits\nimposed by the reach and constraints of their operator's eyes. It extends their\nrange and, as such, productivity, and profitability. Drones operating BVLOS\ninclude a variety of highly sensitive assets and information that could be\nsubject to unintentional or intentional security vulnerabilities. As a\nsolution, blockchain-based services could enable secure and trustworthy\nexchange and storage of related data. They also allow for traceability of\nexchanges and perform synchronization with other nodes in the network. However,\nmost of the blockchain-based approaches focus on the network and the protocol\naspects of drone systems. Few studies focus on the architectural level of\non-chip compute platforms of drones. Based on this observation, the\ncontribution of this paper is twofold: (1) a generic blockchain-based service\narchitecture for on-chip compute platforms of drones, and (2) a concrete\nexample realization of the proposed generic architecture.",

    "abstract": "Immersive video, such as virtual reality (VR) and multi-view videos, is\ngrowing in popularity. Its wireless streaming is an instance of general\nmulticast, extending conventional unicast and multicast, whose effective design\nis still open. This paper investigates the optimization of general rate\nsplitting with linear beamforming for general multicast. Specifically, we\nconsider a multi-carrier single-cell wireless network where a multi-antenna\nbase station (BS) communicates to multiple single-antenna users via general\nmulticast. Linear beamforming is adopted at the BS, and joint decoding is\nadopted at each user. We consider the maximization of the weighted sum rate,\nwhich is a challenging nonconvex problem. Then, we propose an iterative\nalgorithm for the problem to obtain a KKT point using the concave-convex\nprocedure (CCCP). The proposed optimization framework generalizes the existing\nones for rate splitting for various types of services. Finally, we numerically\nshow substantial gains of the proposed solutions over existing schemes and\nreveal the design insights of general rate splitting for general multicast.",

    "abstract": "We devise a performance model for GPU training of Deep Learning\nRecommendation Models (DLRM), whose GPU utilization is low compared to other\nwell-optimized CV and NLP models. We show that both the device active time (the\nsum of kernel runtimes) and the device idle time are important components of\nthe overall device time. We therefore tackle them separately by (1) flexibly\nadopting heuristic-based and ML-based kernel performance models for operators\nthat dominate the device active time, and (2) categorizing operator overheads\ninto five types to determine quantitatively their contribution to the device\nactive time. Combining these two parts, we propose a critical-path-based\nalgorithm to predict the per-batch training time of DLRM by traversing its\nexecution graph. We achieve less than 10% geometric mean average error (GMAE)\nin all kernel performance modeling, and 5.23% and 7.96% geomean errors for GPU\nactive time and overall end-to-end per-batch training time prediction,\nrespectively. We show that our general performance model not only achieves low\nprediction error on DLRM, which has highly customized configurations and is\ndominated by multiple factors, but also yields comparable accuracy on other\ncompute-bound ML models targeted by most previous methods.

    "abstract": "The latest video coding standard, Versatile Video Coding (VVC), achieves\nalmost twice coding efficiency compared to its predecessor, the High Efficiency\nVideo Coding (HEVC). However, achieving this efficiency (for intra coding)\nrequires 31x computational complexity compared to HEVC, making it challenging\nfor low power and real-time applications. This paper, proposes a novel machine\nlearning approach that jointly and separately employs two modalities of\nfeatures, to simplify the intra coding decision. First a set of features are\nextracted that use the existing DCT core of VVC, to assess the texture\ncharacteristics, and forms the first modality of data. This produces high\nquality features with almost no overhead. The distribution of intra modes at\nthe neighboring blocks is also used to form the second modality of data, which\nprovides statistical information about the frame. Second, a two-step feature\nreduction method is designed that reduces the size of feature set, such that a\nlightweight model with a limited number of parameters can be used to learn the\nintra mode decision task. Third, three separate training strategies are\nproposed (1) an offline training strategy using the first (single) modality of\ndata, (2) an online training strategy that uses the second (single) modality,\nand (3) a mixed online-offline strategy that uses bimodal learning. Finally, a\nlow-complexity encoding algorithms is proposed based on the proposed learning\nstrategies. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed methods can\nreduce up to 24% of encoding time, with a negligible loss of coding efficiency.\nMoreover, it is demonstrated how a bimodal learning strategy can boost the\nperformance of learning. Lastly, the proposed method has a very low\ncomputational overhead (0.2%), and uses existing components of a VVC encoder,\nwhich makes it much more practical compared to competing solutions.",

In this\nstudy, we proposed a hybrid reinforcement learning (HRL) framework which\ncombines the rule-based strategy and the deep reinforcement learning (deep RL)\nto support connected eco-driving at signalized intersections in mixed traffic.\nVision-perceptive methods are integrated with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)\ncommunications to achieve higher mobility and energy efficiency in mixed\nconnected traffic. The HRL framework has three components: a rule-based driving\nmanager that operates the collaboration between the rule-based policies and the\nRL policy; a multi-stream neural network that extracts the hidden features of\nvision and V2I information; and a deep RL-based policy network that generate\nboth longitudinal and lateral eco-driving actions. In order to evaluate our\napproach, we developed a Unity-based simulator and designed a mixed-traffic\nintersection scenario. Moreover, several baselines were implemented to compare\nwith our new design, and numerical experiments were conducted to test the\nperformance of the HRL model. The experiments show that our HRL method can\nreduce energy consumption by 12.70% and save 11.75% travel time when compared\nwith a state-of-the-art model-based Eco-Driving approach.",

However, current methods to predict the pressure drop have one of\ntwo problems: lack of accuracy or generalization to different situations. In\nthis work, we present the correlated-informed neural networks (CoINN), a new\nparadigm in applying the artificial neural network (ANN) technique combined\nwith a successful pressure drop correlation as a mapping tool to predict the\npressure drop of zeotropic mixtures in micro-channels. The proposed approach is\ninspired by Transfer Learning, highly used in deep learning problems with\nreduced datasets. Our method improves the ANN performance by transferring the\nknowledge of the Sun & Mishima correlation for the pressure drop to the ANN.\nThe correlation having physical and phenomenological implications for the\npressure drop in micro-channels considerably improves the performance and\ngeneralization capabilities of the ANN. The final architecture consists of\nthree inputs: the mixture vapor quality, the micro-channel inner diameter, and\nthe available pressure drop correlation. The results show the benefits gained\nusing the correlated-informed approach predicting experimental data used for\ntraining and a posterior test with a mean relative error (mre) of 6%, lower\nthan the Sun & Mishima correlation of 13%.

    "abstract": "This paper explores list decoding of convolutional and polar codes for short\nmessages such as those found in the 5G physical broadcast channel. A cyclic\nredundancy check (CRC) is used to select a codeword from a list of likely\ncodewords. One example in the 5G standard encodes a 32-bit message with a\n24-bit CRC and a 512-bit polar code with additional bits added by repetition to\nachieve a very low rate of 32/864. This paper shows that optimizing the CRC\nlength improves the $E_b/N_0$ performance of this polar code, where $E_b/N_0$\nis the ratio of the energy per data bit to the noise power spectral density.\nFurthermore, even better $E_b/N_0$ performance is achieved by replacing the\npolar code with a tail-biting convolutional code (TBCC) with a\ndistance-spectrum-optimal (DSO) CRC. This paper identifies the optimal CRC\nlength to minimize the frame error rate (FER) of a rate-1/5 TBCC at a specific\nvalue of $E_b/N_0$. We also show that this optimized TBCC/CRC can attain the\nsame excellent $E_b/N_0$ performance with the very low rate of 32/864 of the 5G\npolar code, where the low rate is achieved through repetition. We show that the\nproposed TBCC/CRC concatenated code outperforms the PBCH polar code described\nin the 5G standard both in terms of FER and decoding run time. We also explore\nthe tradeoff between undetected error rate and erasure rate as the CRC size\nvaries.",

    "abstract": "With the fast-growing number of classification models being produced every\nday, numerous model interpretation and comparison solutions have also been\nintroduced. For example, LIME and SHAP can interpret what input features\ncontribute more to a classifier's output predictions. Different numerical\nmetrics (e.g., accuracy) can be used to easily compare two classifiers.\nHowever, few works can interpret the contribution of a data feature to a\nclassifier in comparison with its contribution to another classifier. This\ncomparative interpretation can help to disclose the fundamental difference\nbetween two classifiers, select classifiers in different feature conditions,\nand better ensemble two classifiers. To accomplish it, we propose a\nlearning-from-disagreement (LFD) framework to visually compare two\nclassification models. Specifically, LFD identifies data instances with\ndisagreed predictions from two compared classifiers and trains a discriminator\nto learn from the disagreed instances. As the two classifiers' training\nfeatures may not be available, we train the discriminator through a set of\nmeta-features proposed based on certain hypotheses of the classifiers to probe\ntheir behaviors. Interpreting the trained discriminator with the SHAP values of\ndifferent meta-features, we provide actionable insights into the compared\nclassifiers. Also, we introduce multiple metrics to profile the importance of\nmeta-features from different perspectives. With these metrics, one can easily\nidentify meta-features with the most complementary behaviors in two\nclassifiers, and use them to better ensemble the classifiers. We focus on\nbinary classification models in the financial services and advertising industry\nto demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework and visualizations.",

On large graphs, increasing the model\ndepth often means exponential expansion of the scope (i.e., receptive field).\nBeyond just a few layers, two fundamental challenges emerge: 1. degraded\nexpressivity due to oversmoothing, and 2. expensive computation due to\nneighborhood explosion. We propose a design principle to decouple the depth and\nscope of GNNs -- to generate representation of a target entity (i.e., a node or\nan edge), we first extract a localized subgraph as the bounded-size scope, and\nthen apply a GNN of arbitrary depth on top of the subgraph. A properly\nextracted subgraph consists of a small number of critical neighbors, while\nexcluding irrelevant ones. The GNN, no matter how deep it is, smooths the local\nneighborhood into informative representation rather than oversmoothing the\nglobal graph into \"white noise\". Theoretically, decoupling improves the GNN\nexpressive power from the perspectives of graph signal processing (GCN),\nfunction approximation (GraphSAGE) and topological learning (GIN). Empirically,\non seven graphs (with up to 110M nodes) and six backbone GNN architectures, our\ndesign achieves significant accuracy improvement with orders of magnitude\nreduction in computation and hardware cost.",

The proposed differential\nunderstands the practical capacities of the customary two-yield differential,\nwhich is accomplished the initial time for a differential with three results.\nThe 3-OOD component precisely tweaks the track rates of the robot in light of\nthe powers applied on each track inside the line organization, by wiping out\nthe requirement for any dynamic control. The recreation of the robot crossing\nin the line network in various directions and in pipe-twists without slip shows\nthe proposed plan's adequacy",

    "abstract": "The prediction of valence from speech is an important, but challenging\nproblem. The externalization of valence in speech has speaker-dependent cues,\nwhich contribute to performances that are often significantly lower than the\nprediction of other emotional attributes such as arousal and dominance. A\npractical approach to improve valence prediction from speech is to adapt the\nmodels to the target speakers in the test set. Adapting a speech emotion\nrecognition (SER) system to a particular speaker is a hard problem, especially\nwith deep neural networks (DNNs), since it requires optimizing millions of\nparameters. This study proposes an unsupervised approach to address this\nproblem by searching for speakers in the train set with similar acoustic\npatterns as the speaker in the test set. Speech samples from the selected\nspeakers are used to create the adaptation set. This approach leverages\ntransfer learning using pre-trained models, which are adapted with these speech\nsamples. We propose three alternative adaptation strategies: unique speaker,\noversampling and weighting approaches. These methods differ on the use of the\nadaptation set in the personalization of the valence models. The results\ndemonstrate that a valence prediction model can be efficiently personalized\nwith these unsupervised approaches, leading to relative improvements as high as\n13.52%.",

    "abstract": "There exists a distribution discrepancy between training and testing, in the\nway images are fed to modern CNNs. Recent work tried to bridge this gap either\nby fine-tuning or re-training the network at different resolutions. However\nre-training a network is rarely cheap and not always viable. To this end, we\npropose a simple solution to address the train-test distributional shift and\nenhance the performance of pre-trained models -- which commonly ship as a\npackage with deep learning platforms \\eg, PyTorch. Specifically, we demonstrate\nthat running inference on the center crop of an image is not always the best as\nimportant discriminatory information may be cropped-off. Instead we propose to\ncombine results for multiple random crops for a test image. This not only\nmatches the train time augmentation but also provides the full coverage of the\ninput image. We explore combining representation of random crops through\naveraging at different levels \\ie, deep feature level, logit level, and softmax\nlevel. We demonstrate that, for various families of modern deep networks, such\naveraging results in better validation accuracy compared to using a single\ncentral crop per image. The softmax averaging results in the best performance\nfor various pre-trained networks without requiring any re-training or\nfine-tuning whatsoever. On modern GPUs with batch processing, the paper's\napproach to inference of pre-trained networks, is essentially free as all\nimages in a batch can all be processed at once.",

This practice requires strict resource allocation between workloads\nto reduce resource contention and maintain Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees.\nPrior resource allocation works have been shown to improve server utilization\nunder ideal circumstances, yet often compromise QoS guarantees or fail to find\nvalid resource allocations in more dynamic operating environments. Further,\nprior works are fundamentally reliant upon QoS measurements that can, in\npractice, exhibit significant transient fluctuations, thus stable control\nbehavior cannot be reliably achieved. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework for dynamic resource allocation based on proactive QoS prediction.\nThese predictions help guide a reinforcement-learning-based resource controller\ntowards optimal resource allocations while avoiding transient QoS violations\ndue to fluctuating workload demands.

The OED problem seeks to find sensor\nlocations that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) in the solution of\nthe underlying Bayesian inverse problem. Computation of the EIG is usually\nprohibitive for PDE-based OED problems. To make the evaluation of the EIG\ntractable, we approximate the (PDE-based) parameter-to-observable map with a\nderivative-informed projected neural network (DIPNet) surrogate, which exploits\nthe geometry, smoothness, and intrinsic low-dimensionality of the map using a\nsmall and dimension-independent number of PDE solves. The surrogate is then\ndeployed within a greedy algorithm-based solution of the OED problem such that\nno further PDE solves are required. We analyze the EIG approximation error in\nterms of the generalization error of the DIPNet, and demonstrate the efficiency\nand accuracy of the method via numerical experiments involving inverse\nscattering and inverse reactive transport.",

This work examines a\nnovel approach for synthesizing gaze estimation training data based on\nmonocular 3D face reconstruction. Unlike prior works using multi-view\nreconstruction, photo-realistic CG models, or generative neural networks, our\napproach can manipulate and extend the head pose range of existing training\ndata without any additional requirements. We introduce a projective matching\nprocedure to align the reconstructed 3D facial mesh to the camera coordinate\nsystem and synthesize face images with accurate gaze labels. We also propose a\nmask-guided gaze estimation model and data augmentation strategies to further\nimprove the estimation accuracy by taking advantage of the synthetic training\ndata.

    "title": "Complex In-Hand Manipulation via Compliance-Enabled Finger Gaiting and  Multi-Modal Planning",
    "abstract": "Constraining contacts to remain fixed on an object during manipulation limits\nthe potential workspace size, as motion is subject to the hand's kinematic\ntopology. Finger gaiting is one way to alleviate such restraints. It allows\ncontacts to be freely broken and remade so as to operate on different\nmanipulation manifolds. This capability, however, has traditionally been\ndifficult or impossible to practically realize. A finger gaiting system must\nsimultaneously plan for and control forces on the object while maintaining\nstability during contact switching. This work alleviates the traditional\nrequirement by taking advantage of system compliance, allowing the hand to more\neasily switch contacts while maintaining a stable grasp. Our method achieves\ncomplete SO(3) finger gaiting control of grasped objects against gravity by\ndeveloping a manipulation planner that operates via orthogonal safe modes of a\ncompliant, underactuated hand absent of tactile sensors or joint encoders.\nDuring manipulation, a low-latency 6D pose object tracker provides feedback via\nvision, allowing the planner to update its plan online so as to adaptively\nrecover from trajectory deviations. The efficacy of this method is showcased by\nmanipulating both convex and non-convex objects on a real robot. Its robustness\nis evaluated via perturbation rejection and long trajectory goals. To the best\nof the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that has autonomously\nachieved full SO(3) control of objects within-hand via finger gaiting and\nwithout a support surface, elucidating a valuable step towards realizing true\nrobot in-hand manipulation capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Egocentric 3D human pose estimation with a single fisheye camera has drawn a\nsignificant amount of attention recently. However, existing methods struggle\nwith pose estimation from in-the-wild images, because they can only be trained\non synthetic data due to the unavailability of large-scale in-the-wild\negocentric datasets. Furthermore, these methods easily fail when the body parts\nare occluded by or interacting with the surrounding scene. To address the\nshortage of in-the-wild data, we collect a large-scale in-the-wild egocentric\ndataset called Egocentric Poses in the Wild (EgoPW). This dataset is captured\nby a head-mounted fisheye camera and an auxiliary external camera, which\nprovides an additional observation of the human body from a third-person\nperspective during training. We present a new egocentric pose estimation\nmethod, which can be trained on the new dataset with weak external supervision.\nSpecifically, we first generate pseudo labels for the EgoPW dataset with a\nspatio-temporal optimization method by incorporating the external-view\nsupervision. The pseudo labels are then used to train an egocentric pose\nestimation network. To facilitate the network training, we propose a novel\nlearning strategy to supervise the egocentric features with the high-quality\nfeatures extracted by a pretrained external-view pose estimation model. The\nexperiments show that our method predicts accurate 3D poses from a single\nin-the-wild egocentric image and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both\nquantitatively and qualitatively.",

    "abstract": "Jet fires are relatively small and have the least severe effects among the\ndiverse fire accidents that can occur in industrial plants; however, they are\nusually involved in a process known as the domino effect, that leads to more\nsevere events, such as explosions or the initiation of another fire, making the\nanalysis of such fires an important part of risk analysis. This research work\nexplores the application of deep learning models in an alternative approach\nthat uses the semantic segmentation of jet fires flames to extract main\ngeometrical attributes, relevant for fire risk assessments. A comparison is\nmade between traditional image processing methods and some state-of-the-art\ndeep learning models. It is found that the best approach is a deep learning\narchitecture known as UNet, along with its two improvements, Attention UNet and\nUNet++. The models are then used to segment a group of vertical jet flames of\nvarying pipe outlet diameters to extract their main geometrical\ncharacteristics. Attention UNet obtained the best general performance in the\napproximation of both height and area of the flames, while also showing a\nstatistically significant difference between it and UNet++. UNet obtained the\nbest overall performance for the approximation of the lift-off distances;\nhowever, there is not enough data to prove a statistically significant\ndifference between Attention UNet and UNet++. The only instance where UNet++\noutperformed the other models, was while obtaining the lift-off distances of\nthe jet flames with 0.01275 m pipe outlet diameter. In general, the explored\nmodels show good agreement between the experimental and predicted values for\nrelatively large turbulent propane jet flames, released in sonic and subsonic\nregimes; thus, making these radiation zones segmentation models, a suitable\napproach for different jet flame risk management scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In many application domains such as medicine, information retrieval,\ncybersecurity, social media, etc., datasets used for inducing classification\nmodels often have an unequal distribution of the instances of each class. This\nsituation, known as imbalanced data classification, causes low predictive\nperformance for the minority class examples. Thus, the prediction model is\nunreliable although the overall model accuracy can be acceptable. Oversampling\nand undersampling techniques are well-known strategies to deal with this\nproblem by balancing the number of examples of each class. However, their\neffectiveness depends on several factors mainly related to data intrinsic\ncharacteristics, such as imbalance ratio, dataset size and dimensionality,\noverlapping between classes or borderline examples. In this work, the impact of\nthese factors is analyzed through a comprehensive comparative study involving\n40 datasets from different application areas. The objective is to obtain models\nfor automatic selection of the best resampling strategy for any dataset based\non its characteristics. These models allow us to check several factors\nsimultaneously considering a wide range of values since they are induced from\nvery varied datasets that cover a broad spectrum of conditions. This differs\nfrom most studies that focus on the individual analysis of the characteristics\nor cover a small range of values. In addition, the study encompasses both basic\nand advanced resampling strategies that are evaluated by means of eight\ndifferent performance metrics, including new measures specifically designed for\nimbalanced data classification. The general nature of the proposal allows the\nchoice of the most appropriate method regardless of the domain, avoiding the\nsearch for special purpose techniques that could be valid for the target data.",

It\ncharacterizes the invariance of variance, where a biotic system explores\ndifferent pathways of evolution with equal probability in absence of feedback\nsignals, and complex functional structure emerges from quantitative\naccumulation of adaptive-symmetries breaking in response to feedback signals.\nTheoretically and experimentally, we characterize the optimization process of a\nDNN system as an extended adaptive-symmetry-breaking process. One particular\nfinding is that a hierarchically large DNN would have a large reservoir of\nadaptive symmetries, and when the information capacity of the reservoir exceeds\nthe complexity of the dataset, the system could absorb all perturbations of the\nexamples and self-organize into a functional structure of zero training errors\nmeasured by a certain surrogate risk.

The model consists of\nthree constitutes that could be appreciated as the counterparts of Boltzmann\ndistribution, Ising model, and conservative symmetry, respectively: (1) a\nstochastic definition/interpretation of DNNs that is a multilayer probabilistic\ngraphical model, (2) a formalism of circuits that perform biological\ncomputation, (3) a circuit symmetry from which self-similarity between the\nmicroscopic and the macroscopic adaptability manifests.

Several\nreviews have been conducted regarding Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques\nto improve pregnancy outcomes. They are limited by focusing on specific data\nsuch as mother's care during pregnancy. This systematic survey aims to explore\nhow artificial intelligence (AI) can assist with fetal growth monitoring via\nUltrasound (US) image. We used eight medical and computer science bibliographic\ndatabases, including PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, IEEE explore, ACM\nLibrary, Google Scholar, and the Web of Science. We retrieved studies published\nbetween 2010 to 2021. Data extracted from studies were synthesized using a\nnarrative approach. Out of 1269 retrieved studies, we included 107 distinct\nstudies from queries that were relevant to the topic in the survey. We found\nthat 2D ultrasound images were more popular (n=88) than 3D and 4D ultrasound\nimages (n=19). Classification is the most used method (n=42), followed by\nsegmentation (n=31), classification integrated with segmentation (n=16) and\nother miscellaneous such as object-detection, regression and reinforcement\nlearning (n=18). The most common areas within the pregnancy domain were the\nfetus head (n=43), then fetus body (n=31), fetus heart (n=13), fetus abdomen\n(n=10), and lastly the fetus face (n=10). In the most recent studies, deep\nlearning techniques were primarily used (n=81), followed by machine learning\n(n=16), artificial neural network (n=7), and reinforcement learning (n=2). AI\ntechniques played a crucial role in predicting fetal diseases and identifying\nfetus anatomy structures during pregnancy. More research is required to\nvalidate this technology from a physician's perspective, such as pilot studies\nand randomized controlled trials on AI and its applications in a hospital\nsetting.",

    "abstract": "Digital privacy has become an essential component of information and\ncommunications technology (ICT) systems. There are many existing methods for\ndigital privacy protection, including network security, cryptography, and\naccess control. However, there is still a gap in the digital privacy protection\nlevels available for users. This paper studies the digital privacy divide (DPD)\nproblem in ICT systems. First, we introduce an online DPD study for\nunderstanding the DPD problem by collecting responses from 776 ICT users using\ncrowdsourcing task assignments. Second, we propose a factor analysis-based\nstatistical method for generating the DPD index from a set of observable DPD\nquestion variables. In particular, the DPD index provides one scaled measure\nfor the DPD gap by exploring the dimensionality of the eight questions in the\nDPD survey. Third, we introduce a DPD proportional odds model for analyzing the\nrelationship between the DPD status and the socio-demographic patterns of the\nusers. Our results show that the DPD survey meets the internal consistency\nreliability with rigorous statistical measures, e.g., Cronbach's $\\alpha=0.92$.\nFurthermore, the DPD index is shown to capture the underlying communality of\nall DPD variables. Finally, the DPD proportional odds model indicates a strong\nstatistical correlation between the DPD status and the age groups of the ICT\nusers. For example, we find that young users (15-32 years) are generally more\nconcerned about their digital privacy than senior ones (33 years and over).",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results for\nsemi-supervised node classification on graphs. Nevertheless, the challenge of\nhow to effectively learn GNNs with very few labels is still under-explored. As\none of the prevalent semi-supervised methods, pseudo-labeling has been proposed\nto explicitly address the label scarcity problem. It aims to augment the\ntraining set with pseudo-labeled unlabeled nodes with high confidence so as to\nre-train a supervised model in a self-training cycle. However, the existing\npseudo-labeling approaches often suffer from two major drawbacks. First, they\ntend to conservatively expand the label set by selecting only high-confidence\nunlabeled nodes without assessing their informativeness. Unfortunately, those\nhigh-confidence nodes often convey overlapping information with given labels,\nleading to minor improvements for model re-training. Second, these methods\nincorporate pseudo-labels to the same loss function with genuine labels,\nignoring their distinct contributions to the classification task. In this\npaper, we propose a novel informative pseudo-labeling framework, called\nInfoGNN, to facilitate learning of GNNs with extremely few labels. Our key idea\nis to pseudo label the most informative nodes that can maximally represent the\nlocal neighborhoods via mutual information maximization. To mitigate the\npotential label noise and class-imbalance problem arising from pseudo labeling,\nwe also carefully devise a generalized cross entropy loss with a class-balanced\nregularization to incorporate generated pseudo labels into model re-training.\nExtensive experiments on six real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and\nstrong self-supervised methods on graphs.",

    "abstract": "Smart home IoT systems and devices are susceptible to attacks and\nmalfunctions. As a result, users' concerns about their security and safety\nissues arise along with the prevalence of smart home deployments. In a smart\nhome, various anomalies (such as fire or flooding) could happen, due to cyber\nattacks, device malfunctions, or human mistakes. These concerns motivate\nresearchers to propose various anomaly detection approaches. Existing works on\nsmart home anomaly detection focus on checking the sequence of IoT devices'\nevents but leave out the temporal information of events. This limitation\nprevents them to detect anomalies that cause delay rather than\nmissing/injecting events. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel\nanomaly detection method that takes the inter-event intervals into\nconsideration. We propose an innovative metric to quantify the temporal\nsimilarity between two event sequences. We design a mechanism to learn the\ntemporal patterns of event sequences of common daily activities. Delay-caused\nanomalies are detected by comparing the sequence with the learned patterns. We\ncollect device events from a real-world testbed for training and testing. The\nexperiment results show that our proposed method achieves accuracies of 93%,\n88%, 89% for three daily activities.",

Therefore, sectors like governance,\nhealthcare, security, privacy, farming, information authentication,\ncryptocurrencies, internet architecture, data, and so on are unable to utilize\nthe full potential of this technology.

However, evaluating whether the graph contrastive\nlearning is robust to adversarial attacks is still an open problem because most\nexisting graph adversarial attacks are supervised models, which means they\nheavily rely on labels and can only be used to evaluate the graph contrastive\nlearning in a specific scenario. For unsupervised graph representation methods\nsuch as graph contrastive learning, it is difficult to acquire labels in\nreal-world scenarios, making traditional supervised graph attack methods\ndifficult to be applied to test their robustness. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel unsupervised gradient-based adversarial attack that does not rely on\nlabels for graph contrastive learning. We compute the gradients of the\nadjacency matrices of the two views and flip the edges with gradient ascent to\nmaximize the contrastive loss. In this way, we can fully use multiple views\ngenerated by the graph contrastive learning models and pick the most\ninformative edges without knowing their labels, and therefore can promisingly\nsupport our model adapted to more kinds of downstream tasks.

Our algorithm was integrated into two types of architecture as HTAP\nsystems called as unified (single-node) or decoupled (multinode) storage\narchitecture. We evaluate the performance and abort rate of the single-node\narchitecture where SSI is applicable. The multi-node architecture was\ninvestigated for examining the performance overhead applying our algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Co-change candidates are the group of code fragments that require a change if\nany of these fragments experience a modification in a commit operation during\nsoftware evolution. The cloned co-change candidates are a subset of the\nco-change candidates, and the members in this subset are clones of one another.\nThe cloned co-change candidates are usually created by reusing existing code\nfragments in a software system. Detecting cloned co-change candidates is\nessential for clone-tracking, and studies have shown that we can use clone\ndetection tools to find cloned co-change candidates. However, although several\nstudies evaluate clone detection tools for their accuracy in detecting cloned\nfragments, we found no study that evaluates clone detection tools for detecting\ncloned co-change candidates. In this study, we explore the dimension of code\nclone research for detecting cloned co-change candidates. We compare the\nperformance of 12 different configurations of nine promising clone detection\ntools in identifying cloned co-change candidates from eight open-source C and\nJava-based subject systems of various sizes and application domains. A ranked\nlist and analysis of the results provides valuable insights and guidelines into\nselecting and configuring a clone detection tool for identifying co-change\ncandidates and leads to a new dimension of code clone research into change\nimpact analysis.",

Minirhizotron (MR) technology is a widely-used approach for\nphenotyping RSA non-destructively by capturing root imagery over time.\nPrecisely segmenting roots from the soil in MR imagery is a critical step in\nstudying RSA features. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale dataset of\nplant root images captured by MR technology.

The images span a variety of\nconditions including varied root age, root structures, soil types, and depths\nunder the soil surface. All of the images have been annotated with weak\nimage-level labels indicating whether each image contains roots or not. The\nimage-level labels can be used to support weakly supervised learning in plant\nroot segmentation tasks. In addition, 63K images have been manually annotated\nto generate pixel-level binary masks indicating whether each pixel corresponds\nto root or not. These pixel-level binary masks can be used as ground truth for\nsupervised learning in semantic segmentation tasks.

    "abstract": "Recent artificial intelligence-based methods have shown great promise in the\nuse of neural networks for real-time sensing and detection of transmission line\nfaults and estimation of their locations. The expansion of power systems\nincluding transmission lines with various lengths have made a fault detection,\nclassification, and location estimation process more challenging. Transmission\nline datasets are stream data which are continuously collected by various\nsensors and hence, require generalized and fast fault diagnosis approaches.\nNewly collected datasets including voltages and currents might not have enough\nand accurate labels (fault and no fault) that are useful to train neural\nnetworks. In this paper, a novel transfer learning framework based on a\npre-trained LeNet-5 convolutional neural network is proposed. This method is\nable to diagnose faults for different transmission line lengths and impedances\nby transferring the knowledge from a source convolutional neural network to\npredict a dissimilar target dataset. By transferring this knowledge, faults\nfrom various transmission lines, without having enough labels, can be diagnosed\nfaster and more efficiently compared to the existing methods. To prove the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of this methodology, seven different datasets\nthat include various lengths of transmission lines are used. The robustness of\nthe proposed methodology against generator voltage fluctuation, variation in\nfault distance, fault inception angle, fault resistance, and phase difference\nbetween the two generators are well shown, thus proving its practical values in\nthe fault diagnosis of transmission lines.",

    "abstract": "Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) applications have agents that actuate in their\nlocal vicinity, while requiring measurements that capture the state of their\nlarger environment to make actuation choices. These measurements are made by\nsensors and communicated over a network as update packets. Network resource\nconstraints dictate that updates arrive at an agent intermittently and be aged\non their arrival. This can be alleviated by providing an agent with a fast\nenough rate of estimates of the measurements.\nOften works on estimation assume knowledge of the dynamic model of the system\nbeing measured. However, as CPS applications become pervasive, such information\nmay not be available in practice. In this work, we propose a novel deep neural\nnetwork architecture that leverages Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to\nlearn estimates in a model-free setting using only updates received over the\nnetwork. We detail an online algorithm that enables training of our\narchitecture.\nThe architecture is shown to provide good estimates of measurements of both a\nlinear and a non-linear dynamic system. It learns good estimates even when the\nlearning proceeds over a generic network setting in which the distributions\nthat govern the rate and age of received measurements may change significantly\nover time.

    "title": "Combining Machine Learning with Knowledge Engineering to detect Fake  News in Social Networks-a survey",
    "abstract": "Due to extensive spread of fake news on social and news media it became an\nemerging research topic now a days that gained attention. In the news media and\nsocial media the information is spread highspeed but without accuracy and hence\ndetection mechanism should be able to predict news fast enough to tackle the\ndissemination of fake news. It has the potential for negative impacts on\nindividuals and society. Therefore, detecting fake news on social media is\nimportant and also a technically challenging problem these days. We knew that\nMachine learning is helpful for building Artificial intelligence systems based\non tacit knowledge because it can help us to solve complex problems due to real\nword data. On the other side we knew that Knowledge engineering is helpful for\nrepresenting experts knowledge which people aware of that knowledge. Due to\nthis we proposed that integration of Machine learning and knowledge engineering\ncan be helpful in detection of fake news. In this paper we present what is fake\nnews, importance of fake news, overall impact of fake news on different areas,\ndifferent ways to detect fake news on social media, existing detections\nalgorithms that can help us to overcome the issue, similar application areas\nand at the end we proposed combination of data driven and engineered knowledge\nto combat fake news. We studied and compared three different modules text\nclassifiers, stance detection applications and fact checking existing\ntechniques that can help to detect fake news. Furthermore, we investigated the\nimpact of fake news on society. Experimental evaluation of publically available\ndatasets and our proposed fake news detection combination can serve better in\ndetection of fake news.",

We evaluate our model, GANMF,\nthrough well-known datasets in the RS community and show improvements over\ntraditional CF approaches and GAN-based models.

    "abstract": "Classical Visual Servoing (VS) rely on handcrafted visual features, which\nlimit their generalizability. Recently, a number of approaches, some based on\nDeep Neural Networks, have been proposed to overcome this limitation by\ncomparing directly the entire target and current camera images. However, by\ngetting rid of the visual features altogether, those approaches require the\ntarget and current images to be essentially similar, which precludes the\ngeneralization to unknown, cluttered, scenes. Here we propose to perform VS\nbased on visual features as in classical VS approaches but, contrary to the\nlatter, we leverage recent breakthroughs in Deep Learning to automatically\nextract and match the visual features. By doing so, our approach enjoys the\nadvantages from both worlds: (i) because our approach is based on visual\nfeatures, it is able to steer the robot towards the object of interest even in\npresence of significant distraction in the background; (ii) because the\nfeatures are automatically extracted and matched, our approach can easily and\nautomatically generalize to unseen objects and scenes. In addition, we propose\nto use a render engine to synthesize the target image, which offers a further\nlevel of generalization. We demonstrate these advantages in a robotic grasping\ntask, where the robot is able to steer, with high accuracy, towards the object\nto grasp, based simply on an image of the object rendered from the camera view\ncorresponding to the desired robot grasping pose.",

    "title": "Lightweight Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images  via Feature Correlation",
    "abstract": "Salient object detection in optical remote sensing images (ORSI-SOD) has been\nwidely explored for understanding ORSIs. However, previous methods focus mainly\non improving the detection accuracy while neglecting the cost in memory and\ncomputation, which may hinder their real-world applications. In this paper, we\npropose a novel lightweight ORSI-SOD solution, named CorrNet, to address these\nissues. In CorrNet, we first lighten the backbone (VGG-16) and build a\nlightweight subnet for feature extraction. Then, following the coarse-to-fine\nstrategy, we generate an initial coarse saliency map from high-level semantic\nfeatures in a Correlation Module (CorrM). The coarse saliency map serves as the\nlocation guidance for low-level features. In CorrM, we mine the object location\ninformation between high-level semantic features through the cross-layer\ncorrelation operation. Finally, based on low-level detailed features, we refine\nthe coarse saliency map in the refinement subnet equipped with Dense\nLightweight Refinement Blocks, and produce the final fine saliency map. By\nreducing the parameters and computations of each component, CorrNet ends up\nhaving only 4.09M parameters and running with 21.09G FLOPs. Experimental\nresults on two public datasets demonstrate that our lightweight CorrNet\nachieves competitive or even better performance compared with 26\nstate-of-the-art methods (including 16 large CNN-based methods and 2\nlightweight methods), and meanwhile enjoys the clear memory and run time\nefficiency.

Data from\nsemi-structured interviews reveals that leadership: (1) is dynamically shared\namong team members; (2) engenders a sense of belonging to the team; and (3)\ninvolves balancing competing organizational cultures (e.g. balancing the new\nagile culture with the old milestone-driven culture).

Then we propose an execution-guided pre-training strategy to\ninject prior knowledge of environments to the language model with a pure\nsynthetic pre-training corpus. Experimental results on tasks including Alchemy,\nScene, Tangrams and ProPara demonstrate the effectiveness of LEMON: it achieves\nnew state-of-the-art results on Alchemy, Scene and ProPara, and the\nexecution-guided pre-training strategy brings remarkable improvements on all\nexperimental tasks.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the patterns of misclassified ImageNet images is particularly\nimportant, as it could guide us to design deep neural networks (DNN) that\ngeneralize better. However, the richness of ImageNet imposes difficulties for\nresearchers to visually find any useful patterns of misclassification. Here, to\nhelp find these patterns, we propose \"Superclassing ImageNet dataset\". It is a\nsubset of ImageNet which consists of 10 superclasses, each containing 7-116\nrelated subclasses (e.g., 52 bird types, 116 dog types). By training neural\nnetworks on this dataset, we found that: (i) Misclassifications are rarely\nacross superclasses, but mainly among subclasses within a superclass. (ii)\nEnsemble networks trained each only on subclasses of a given superclass perform\nbetter than the same network trained on all subclasses of all superclasses.\nHence, we propose a two-stage Super-Sub framework, and demonstrate that: (i)\nThe framework improves overall classification performance by 3.3%, by first\ninferring a superclass using a generalist superclass-level network, and then\nusing a specialized network for final subclass-level classification. (ii)\nAlthough the total parameter storage cost increases to a factor N+1 for N\nsuperclasses compared to using a single network, with finetuning, delta and\nquantization aware training techniques this can be reduced to 0.2N+1. Another\nadvantage of this efficient implementation is that the memory cost on the GPU\nduring inference is equivalent to using only one network. The reason is we\ninitiate each subclass-level network through addition of small parameter\nvariations (deltas) to the superclass-level network. (iii) Finally, our\nframework promises to be more scalable and generalizable than the common\nalternative of simply scaling up a vanilla network in size, since very large\nnetworks often suffer from overfitting and gradient vanishing.",

Due to its recursive\ndefinition, JSON data are naturally represented as trees. Different from other\nhierarchical formats such as XML, JSON supports both ordered and unordered\nsibling collections within a single document. This feature poses a new\nchallenge to the tree model and distance computation. We propose JSON tree, a\nlossless tree representation of JSON documents, and define the JSON Edit\nDistance (JEDI), the first edit-based distance measure for JSON documents.

To boost the performance of JSON\nsimilarity queries, we introduce an index called JSIM and a highly effective\nupper bound based on tree sorting.

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving has been at the forefront of public interest, and a\npivotal debate to widespread concerns is safety in the transportation system.\nDeep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been applied to autonomous driving to\nprovide solutions for obstacle avoidance. However, in a road traffic junction\nscenario, the vehicle typically receives partial observations from the\ntransportation environment, while DRL needs to rely on long-term rewards to\ntrain a reliable model by maximising the cumulative rewards, which may take the\nrisk when exploring new actions and returning either a positive reward or a\npenalty in the case of collisions. Although safety concerns are usually\nconsidered in the design of a reward function, they are not fully considered as\nthe critical metric to directly evaluate the effectiveness of DRL algorithms in\nautonomous driving. In this study, we evaluated the safety performance of three\nbaseline DRL models (DQN, A2C, and PPO) and proposed a self-awareness module\nfrom an attention mechanism for DRL to improve the safety evaluation for an\nanomalous vehicle in a complex road traffic junction environment, such as\nintersection and roundabout scenarios, based on four metrics: collision rate,\nsuccess rate, freezing rate, and total reward. Our two experimental results in\nthe training and testing phases revealed the baseline DRL with poor safety\nperformance, while our proposed self-awareness attention-DQN can significantly\nimprove the safety performance in intersection and roundabout scenarios.",

Exteroceptive perception is crucial for fast and\nenergy-efficient locomotion: perceiving the terrain before making contact with\nit enables planning and adaptation of the gait ahead of time to maintain speed\nand stability. However, utilizing exteroceptive perception robustly for\nlocomotion has remained a grand challenge in robotics. Snow, vegetation, and\nwater visually appear as obstacles on which the robot cannot step~-- or are\nmissing altogether due to high reflectance. Additionally, depth perception can\ndegrade due to difficult lighting, dust, fog, reflective or transparent\nsurfaces, sensor occlusion, and more. For this reason, the most robust and\ngeneral solutions to legged locomotion to date rely solely on proprioception.\nThis severely limits locomotion speed, because the robot has to physically feel\nout the terrain before adapting its gait accordingly. Here we present a robust\nand general solution to integrating exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception\nfor legged locomotion. We leverage an attention-based recurrent encoder that\nintegrates proprioceptive and exteroceptive input. The encoder is trained\nend-to-end and learns to seamlessly combine the different perception modalities\nwithout resorting to heuristics.

In this paper, we propose a fast method for\nexactly enumerating a very large number of all lower cost solutions for various\ncombinatorial problems. Our method is based on backtracking for a given\ndecision diagram which represents the feasible solutions of a problem. The main\nidea is to memoize the intervals of cost bounds to avoid duplicate search in\nthe backtracking process. Although existing state-of-the-art methods with\ndynamic programming requires a pseudo-polynomial time with the total cost\nvalues, it may take an exponential time when the cost values become large. In\ncontrast, the computation time of the proposed method does not directly depend\non the total cost values, but is bounded by the input and output size of the\ndecision diagrams. Therefore, it can be much faster than the existing methods\nif the cost values are large but the output of the decision diagrams are\nwell-compressed. Our experimental results show that, for some practical\ninstances of the Hamiltonian path problem, we succeeded in exactly enumerating\nbillions of all lower cost solutions in a few seconds, which is hundred or more\ntimes faster than existing methods. Our method can be regarded as a novel\nsearch algorithm which integrates the two classical techniques,\nbranch-and-bound and dynamic programming.

Normally, only the data of monoglot\nspeakers are available for model training, thus the speaker similarity is\nrelatively low between the synthesized cross-lingual speech and the native\nlanguage recordings. Based on the multilingual transformer text-to-speech\nmodel, this paper studies a multi-task learning framework to improve the\ncross-lingual speaker similarity. To further improve the speaker similarity,\njoint training with a speaker classifier is proposed. Here, a scheme similar to\nparallel scheduled sampling is proposed to train the transformer model\nefficiently to avoid breaking the parallel training mechanism when introducing\njoint training. By using multi-task learning and speaker classifier joint\ntraining, in subjective and objective evaluations, the cross-lingual speaker\nsimilarity can be consistently improved for both the seen and unseen speakers\nin the training set.",

    "title": "Deep Unsupervised Contrastive Hashing for Large-Scale Cross-Modal  Text-Image Retrieval in Remote Sensing",
    "abstract": "Due to the availability of large-scale multi-modal data (e.g., satellite\nimages acquired by different sensors, text sentences, etc) archives, the\ndevelopment of cross-modal retrieval systems that can search and retrieve\nsemantically relevant data across different modalities based on a query in any\nmodality has attracted great attention in RS. In this paper, we focus our\nattention on cross-modal text-image retrieval, where queries from one modality\n(e.g., text) can be matched to archive entries from another (e.g., image). Most\nof the existing cross-modal text-image retrieval systems require a high number\nof labeled training samples and also do not allow fast and memory-efficient\nretrieval due to their intrinsic characteristics. These issues limit the\napplicability of the existing cross-modal retrieval systems for large-scale\napplications in RS. To address this problem, in this paper we introduce a novel\ndeep unsupervised cross-modal contrastive hashing (DUCH) method for RS\ntext-image retrieval. The proposed DUCH is made up of two main modules: 1)\nfeature extraction module (which extracts deep representations of the\ntext-image modalities); and 2) hashing module (which learns to generate\ncross-modal binary hash codes from the extracted representations). Within the\nhashing module, we introduce a novel multi-objective loss function including:\ni) contrastive objectives that enable similarity preservation in both intra-\nand inter-modal similarities; ii) an adversarial objective that is enforced\nacross two modalities for cross-modal representation consistency; iii)\nbinarization objectives for generating representative hash codes. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed DUCH outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised\ncross-modal hashing methods on two multi-modal (image and text) benchmark\narchives in RS.

However,\nthese algorithms cannot achieve strong embedding capacity. Thus, in this paper,\nwe propose an advanced RDHEI scheme based on lossless pixel conversion (LPC).\nDifferent from the previous RDHEI algorithms, LPC is inspired by the planar map\ncoloring question, and it performs a dynamic image division process to divide\nthe original image into irregular regions instead of regular blocks as in the\nprevious RDHEI algorithms. In the process of LPC, pixel conversion is performed\nby region; that is, pixels in the same regions are converted to the same\nconversion values, which will occupy a smaller size, and then the available\nroom can be reserved to accommodate additional data. LPC is a reversible\nprocess, so the original image can be losslessly recovered on the receiver\nside. Experimental results show that the embedding capacity of the proposed\nscheme outperforms the existing RDHEI algorithms.",

In addition, to enhance privacy protection, CoAvoid\napplies fuzzification and obfuscation measures to shelter sensitive data,\nmaking both servers and users agnostic to information of both low and high-risk\npopulations. The evaluation demonstrates good efficacy and security of CoAvoid.\nCompared with four state-of-art contact tracing applications, CoAvoid can\nreduce upload data by at least 90% and simultaneously resist wormhole and\nreplay attacks in various scenarios.",

Therefore, they are not\nimplementable for practical large-scale cell-free massive MIMO systems. To\ntackle this issue, we propose an iterative power control algorithm based on the\nframe work of an accelerated projected gradient (APG) method. In particular,\neach iteration of the proposed method is done by simple closed-form\nexpressions, where a penalty method is applied to bring constraints into the\nobjective in the form of penalty functions. Finally, the convergence of the\nproposed algorithm is analytically proved and numerically compared to the known\nsolution based on SOCP. Simulations results demonstrate that our proposed power\ncontrol algorithm can achieve the same EE as the existing SOCPs-based method,\nbut more importantly, its run time is much lower (one to two orders of\nmagnitude reduction in run time, compared to the SOCPs-based approaches).",

    "abstract": "Parametric 3D models have formed a fundamental role in modeling deformable\nobjects, such as human bodies, faces, and hands; however, the construction of\nsuch parametric models requires significant manual intervention and domain\nexpertise. Recently, neural implicit 3D representations have shown great\nexpressibility in capturing 3D shape geometry. We observe that deformable\nobject motion is often semantically structured, and thus propose to learn\nStructured-implicit PArametric Models (SPAMs) as a deformable object\nrepresentation that structurally decomposes non-rigid object motion into\npart-based disentangled representations of shape and pose, with each being\nrepresented by deep implicit functions. This enables a structured\ncharacterization of object movement, with part decomposition characterizing a\nlower-dimensional space in which we can establish coarse motion correspondence.\nIn particular, we can leverage the part decompositions at test time to fit to\nnew depth sequences of unobserved shapes, by establishing part correspondences\nbetween the input observation and our learned part spaces; this guides a robust\njoint optimization between the shape and pose of all parts, even under dramatic\nmotion sequences. Experiments demonstrate that our part-aware shape and pose\nunderstanding lead to state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction and\ntracking of depth sequences of complex deforming object motion.

POI recommendation is often performed by incorporating\ncontextual information into previously designed recommendation algorithms. Some\nof the major contextual information that has been considered in POI\nrecommendation are the location attributes (i.e., exact coordinates of a\nlocation, category, and check-in time), the user attributes (i.e., comments,\nreviews, tips, and check-in made to the locations), and other information, such\nas the distance of the POI from user's main activity location, and the social\ntie between users. The right selection of such factors can significantly impact\nthe performance of the POI recommendation. However, previous research does not\nconsider the impact of the combination of these different factors. In this\npaper, we propose different contextual models and analyze the fusion of\ndifferent major contextual information in POI recommendation. The major\ncontributions of this paper are: (i) providing an extensive survey of\ncontext-aware location recommendation (ii) quantifying and analyzing the impact\nof different contextual information (e.g., social, temporal, spatial, and\ncategorical) in the POI recommendation on available baselines and two new\nlinear and non-linear models, that can incorporate all the major contextual\ninformation into a single recommendation model, and (iii) evaluating the\nconsidered models using two well-known real-world datasets.

The natural learning process is extremely slow due to\nunfamiliar free-fall dynamics, stress induced blocking of kinesthetic feedback,\nand complexity of the required movements. The key idea is to augment the\nlearner with an automatic control system that would be able to perform the\ntrained activity if it had direct access to the learner's body as an actuator.\nThe aiding system will supply the following visual cues to the learner: 1.\nFeedback of the current body posture; 2. The body posture that would bring the\nbody to perform the desired maneuver; 3. Prediction of the future inertial\nposition and orientation if the body retains its present posture. The system\nwill enable novices to maintain stability in free-fall and perceive the\nunfamiliar environmental dynamics, thus accelerating the initial stages of\nskill acquisition.

    "abstract": "The last few years have seen the emergence of IoT processors: ultra-low power\nsystems-on-chips (SoCs) combining lightweight and flexible micro-controller\nunits (MCUs), often based on open-ISA RISC-V cores, with application-specific\naccelerators to maximize performance and energy efficiency. Overall, this\nheterogeneity level requires complex hardware and a full-fledged software stack\nto orchestrate the execution and exploit platform features. For this reason,\nenabling agile design space exploration becomes a crucial asset for this new\nclass of low-power SoCs. In this scenario, high-level simulators play an\nessential role in breaking the speed and design effort bottlenecks of\ncycle-accurate simulators and FPGA prototypes, respectively, while preserving\nfunctional and timing accuracy. We present GVSoC, a highly configurable and\ntiming-accurate event-driven simulator that combines the efficiency of C++\nmodels with the flexibility of Python configuration scripts. GVSoC is fully\nopen-sourced, with the intent to drive future research in the area of highly\nparallel and heterogeneous RISC-V based IoT processors, leveraging three\nfoundational features: Python-based modular configuration of the hardware\ndescription, easy calibration of platform parameters for accurate performance\nestimation, and high-speed simulation. Experimental results show that GVSoC\nenables practical functional and performance analysis and design exploration at\nthe full-platform level (processors, memory, peripherals and IOs) with a\nspeed-up of 2500x with respect to cycle-accurate simulation with errors\ntypically below 10% for performance analysis.",

    "abstract": "The presented study elaborates a multi-server catastrophic retrial queueing\nmodel considering preemptive repeat priority policy with phase-type (PH)\ndistributed retrial times. For the sake of comprehension, the scenario of model\noperation prior and later to the occurrence of the disaster is referred to as\nthe normal scenario and as the catastrophic scenario, respectively. In both\nscenarios, the arrival and service processes of all types of calls follow\nmarked Markovian arrival process (MMAP) and PH distribution with distinct\nparameters, respectively. In the normal scenario, the incoming heterogeneous\ncalls are categorized as handoff calls and new calls. An arriving new call will\nbe blocked when all the channels are occupied, and consequently, will join the\norbit (virtual space) of infinite capacity. From the orbit, the blocked new\ncall can either retry for the service or exit the system following PH\ndistribution. Whereas, an arriving handoff call is given preemptive repeat\npriority over a new call in service when all the channels are occupied and at\nleast one of the channel is occupied with a new call otherwise the handoff call\nis dropped, and consequently, this preempted new call will join the orbit. In\nthe catastrophic scenario, when a disaster causes the shut down of the entire\nsystem and failure of all functioning channels, a set of backup channels is\nquickly deployed to restore services. The Markov chain's ergodicity criteria\nare established by demonstrating that it belongs to the class of asymptotically\nquasi-Toeplitz Markov chains (AQTMC). For the approximate computation of the\nstationary distribution, a new approach is developed.\nAn optimization problem to obtain optimal value of total number of backup\nchannels has been formulated and dealt by employing non dominated sorting\ngenetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) approach.",

In this paper, we consider an\nenhancement-enabled video streaming network under a time-varying wireless\nnetwork and limited computation capacity. \"Enhancement\" means that the client\ncan improve the quality of the downloaded video segments via image processing\nmodules. We aim to design a joint bitrate adaptation and client-side\nenhancement algorithm toward maximizing the quality of experience (QoE). We\nformulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework, named ENAVS. As video streaming\nquality is mainly affected by video compression, we demonstrate that the video\nenhancement algorithm outperforms the super-resolution algorithm in terms of\nsignal-to-noise ratio and frames per second, suggesting a better solution for\nclient processing in video streaming. Ultimately, we implement ENAVS and\ndemonstrate extensive testbed results under real-world bandwidth traces and\nvideos.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has not been fully explored for point cloud\nanalysis. Current frameworks are mainly based on point cloud reconstruction.\nGiven only 3D coordinates, such approaches tend to learn local geometric\nstructures and contours, while failing in understanding high level semantic\ncontent. Consequently, they achieve unsatisfactory performance in downstream\ntasks such as classification, segmentation, etc. To fill this gap, we propose a\ngeneric Contour-Perturbed Reconstruction Network (CP-Net), which can\neffectively guide self-supervised reconstruction to learn semantic content in\nthe point cloud, and thus promote discriminative power of point cloud\nrepresentation. First, we introduce a concise contour-perturbed augmentation\nmodule for point cloud reconstruction. With guidance of geometry disentangling,\nwe divide point cloud into contour and content components. Subsequently, we\nperturb the contour components and preserve the content components on the point\ncloud. As a result, self supervisor can effectively focus on semantic content,\nby reconstructing the original point cloud from such perturbed one. Second, we\nuse this perturbed reconstruction as an assistant branch, to guide the learning\nof basic reconstruction branch via a distinct dual-branch consistency loss. In\nthis case, our CP-Net not only captures structural contour but also learn\nsemantic content for discriminative downstream tasks. Finally, we perform\nextensive experiments on a number of point cloud benchmarks. Part segmentation\nresults demonstrate that our CP-Net (81.5% of mIoU) outperforms the previous\nself-supervised models, and narrows the gap with the fully-supervised methods.\nFor classification, we get a competitive result with the fully-supervised\nmethods on ModelNet40 (92.5% accuracy) and ScanObjectNN (87.9% accuracy).

    "abstract": "In this paper, based on results of exact learning, test theory, and rough set\ntheory, we study arbitrary infinite families of concepts each of which consists\nof an infinite set of elements and an infinite set of subsets of this set\ncalled concepts. We consider the notion of a problem over a family of concepts\nthat is described by a finite number of elements: for a given concept, we\nshould recognize which of the elements under consideration belong to this\nconcept. As algorithms for problem solving, we consider decision trees of five\ntypes: (i) using membership queries, (ii) using equivalence queries, (iii)\nusing both membership and equivalence queries, (iv) using proper equivalence\nqueries, and (v) using both membership and proper equivalence queries. As time\ncomplexity, we study the depth of decision trees. In the worst case, with the\ngrowth of the number of elements in the problem description, the minimum depth\nof decision trees of the first type either grows as a logarithm or linearly,\nand the minimum depth of decision trees of each of the other types either is\nbounded from above by a constant or grows as a logarithm, or linearly. The\nobtained results allow us to distinguish seven complexity classes of infinite\nfamilies of concepts.",

    "title": "Multi-agent Covering Option Discovery based on Kronecker Product of  Factor Graphs",
    "abstract": "Covering option discovery has been developed to improve the exploration of\nreinforcement learning in single-agent scenarios with sparse reward signals,\nthrough connecting the most distant states in the embedding space provided by\nthe Fiedler vector of the state transition graph. However, these option\ndiscovery methods cannot be directly extended to multi-agent scenarios, since\nthe joint state space grows exponentially with the number of agents in the\nsystem. Thus, existing researches on adopting options in multi-agent scenarios\nstill rely on single-agent option discovery and fail to directly discover the\njoint options that can improve the connectivity of the joint state space of\nagents. In this paper, we show that it is indeed possible to directly compute\nmulti-agent options with collaborative exploratory behaviors among the agents,\nwhile still enjoying the ease of decomposition. Our key idea is to approximate\nthe joint state space as a Kronecker graph -- the Kronecker product of\nindividual agents' state transition graphs, based on which we can directly\nestimate the Fiedler vector of the joint state space using the Laplacian\nspectrum of individual agents' transition graphs. This decomposition enables us\nto efficiently construct multi-agent joint options by encouraging agents to\nconnect the sub-goal joint states which are corresponding to the minimum or\nmaximum values of the estimated joint Fiedler vector. The evaluation based on\nmulti-agent collaborative tasks shows that the proposed algorithm can\nsuccessfully identify multi-agent options, and significantly outperforms prior\nworks using single-agent options or no options, in terms of both faster\nexploration and higher cumulative rewards.",

In\nparticular, the popular High Performance Computing (HPC) application, the\nWeather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) is being currently being utilized\nfor high resolution forecasting and research which generate very large\ndatasets, especially when investigating transient weather phenomena. However,\nthe I/O options currently available in WRF have been found to be a bottleneck\nat scale.\nIn this work, we demonstrate the impact of integrating a next-generation\nparallel I/O framework - ADIOS2, as a new I/O backend option in WRF. First, we\ndetail the implementation considerations, setbacks, and solutions that were\nencountered during the integration. Next we examine the results of I/O write\ntimes and compare them with results of currently available WRF I/O options. The\nresulting I/O times show over an order of magnitude speedup when using ADIOS2\ncompared to classic MPI-I/O based solutions. Additionally, the node-local burst\nbuffer write capabilities as well as in-line lossless compression capabilities\nof ADIOS2 are showcased, further boosting performance. Finally, usage of the\nnovel ADIOS2 in-situ analysis capabilities for weather forecasting is\ndemonstrated using a WRF forecasting pipeline, showing a seamless end-to-end\nprocessing pipeline that occurs concurrently with the execution of the WRF\nmodel, leading to a dramatic improvement in total time to solution.",

LaMDA is a family\nof Transformer-based neural language models specialized for dialog, which have\nup to 137B parameters and are pre-trained on 1.56T words of public dialog data\nand web text. While model scaling alone can improve quality, it shows less\nimprovements on safety and factual grounding. We demonstrate that fine-tuning\nwith annotated data and enabling the model to consult external knowledge\nsources can lead to significant improvements towards the two key challenges of\nsafety and factual grounding. The first challenge, safety, involves ensuring\nthat the model's responses are consistent with a set of human values, such as\npreventing harmful suggestions and unfair bias. We quantify safety using a\nmetric based on an illustrative set of human values, and we find that filtering\ncandidate responses using a LaMDA classifier fine-tuned with a small amount of\ncrowdworker-annotated data offers a promising approach to improving model\nsafety. The second challenge, factual grounding, involves enabling the model to\nconsult external knowledge sources, such as an information retrieval system, a\nlanguage translator, and a calculator. We quantify factuality using a\ngroundedness metric, and we find that our approach enables the model to\ngenerate responses grounded in known sources, rather than responses that merely\nsound plausible.

Popular aggregation methods, such as the majority rule,\noften fail to produce the optimal result, especially in high-complexity tasks.\nMethods that rely on meta-cognitive information, such as confidence-based\nmethods and the Surprisingly Popular Option, had shown an improvement in\nvarious tasks. However, there is still a significant number of cases with no\noptimal solution. Our aim is to exploit meta-cognitive information and to learn\nfrom it, for the purpose of enhancing the ability of the group to produce a\ncorrect answer. Specifically, we propose two different feature-representation\napproaches: (1) Response-Centered feature Representation (RCR), which focuses\non the characteristics of the individual response instances, and (2)\nAnswer-Centered feature Representation (ACR), which focuses on the\ncharacteristics of each of the potential answers. Using these two\nfeature-representation approaches, we train Machine-Learning (ML) models, for\nthe purpose of predicting the correctness of a response and of an answer.

    "abstract": "Assessing the effects of a policy based on observational data from a\ndifferent policy is a common problem across several high-stake decision-making\ndomains, and several off-policy evaluation (OPE) techniques have been proposed.\nHowever, these methods largely formulate OPE as a problem disassociated from\nthe process used to generate the data (i.e. structural assumptions in the form\nof a causal graph). We argue that explicitly highlighting this association has\nimportant implications on our understanding of the fundamental limits of OPE.\nFirst, this implies that current formulation of OPE corresponds to a narrow set\nof tasks, i.e. a specific causal estimand which is focused on prospective\nevaluation of policies over populations or sub-populations. Second, we\ndemonstrate how this association motivates natural desiderata to consider a\ngeneral set of causal estimands, particularly extending the role of OPE for\ncounterfactual off-policy evaluation at the level of individuals of the\npopulation. A precise description of the causal estimand highlights which OPE\nestimands are identifiable from observational data under the stated generative\nassumptions. For those OPE estimands that are not identifiable, the causal\nperspective further highlights where more experimental data is necessary, and\nhighlights situations where human expertise can aid identification and\nestimation. Furthermore, many formalisms of OPE overlook the role of\nuncertainty entirely in the estimation process.We demonstrate how specifically\ncharacterising the causal estimand highlights the different sources of\nuncertainty and when human expertise can naturally manage this uncertainty. We\ndiscuss each of these aspects as actionable desiderata for future OPE research\nat scale and in-line with practical utility.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides an experimentally validated, probabilistic model of file\nbehavior when consumed by a set of pre-existing parsers. File behavior is\nmeasured by way of a standardized set of Boolean \"messages\" produced as the\nfiles are read. By thresholding the posterior probability that a file\nexhibiting a particular set of messages is from a particular dialect, our model\nyields a practical classification algorithm for two dialects. We demonstrate\nthat this thresholding algorithm for two dialects can be bootstrapped from a\ntraining set consisting primarily of one dialect. Both the (parametric)\ntheoretical and the (non-parametric) empirical distributions of file behaviors\nfor one dialect yield good classification performance, and outperform\nclassification based on simply counting messages.\nOur theoretical framework relies on statistical independence of messages\nwithin each dialect. Violations of this assumption are detectable and allow a\nformat analyst to identify \"boundaries\" between dialects. A format analyst can\ntherefore greatly reduce the number of files they need to consider when\ncrafting new criteria for dialect detection, since they need only consider the\nfiles that exhibit ambiguous message patterns.",

    "abstract": "The provision of communication services via portable and mobile devices, such\nas aerial base stations, is a crucial concept to be realized in 5G/6G networks.\nConventionally, IoT/edge devices need to transmit the data directly to the base\nstation for training the model using machine learning techniques. The data\ntransmission introduces privacy issues that might lead to security concerns and\nmonetary losses. Recently, Federated learning was proposed to partially solve\nprivacy issues via model-sharing with base station. However, the centralized\nnature of federated learning only allow the devices within the vicinity of base\nstations to share the trained models. Furthermore, the long-range communication\ncompels the devices to increase transmission power, which raises the energy\nefficiency concerns. In this work, we propose distributed federated learning\n(DBFL) framework that overcomes the connectivity and energy efficiency issues\nfor distant devices. The DBFL framework is compatible with mobile edge\ncomputing architecture that connects the devices in a distributed manner using\nclustering protocols. Experimental results show that the framework increases\nthe classification performance by 7.4\\% in comparison to conventional federated\nlearning while reducing the energy consumption.",

Usually\ninfinite session types are introduced as simple finite-state expressions\n$\\mathsf{rec}\\, X.T$ or by non-parametric equational definitions $X\\doteq T$.\nAlternatively, some systems of label- or value-dependent session types go\nbeyond simple recursive types. However, leaving dependent types aside, there is\na much richer world of infinite session types, ranging through various forms of\nparametric equational definitions, all the way to arbitrary infinite types in a\ncoinductively defined space. We study infinite session types across a spectrum\nof shades of grey on the way to the bright light of general infinite types. We\nidentify four points on the spectrum, characterised by different styles of\nequational definitions, and show that they form a strict hierarchy by\nestablishing bidirectional correspondences with classes of automata:\nfinite-state, 1-counter, pushdown and 2-counter. This allows us to establish\ndecidability and undecidability results for the problems of type formation,\ntype equivalence and duality in each class of types.

    "abstract": "With deep learning being gaining attention from the research community for\nprediction and control of real physical systems, learning important\nrepresentations is becoming now more than ever mandatory. It is of extremely\nimportance that deep learning representations are coherent with physics. When\nlearning from discrete data this can be guaranteed by including some sort of\nprior into the learning, however not all discretization priors preserve\nimportant structures from the physics. In this paper we introduce Symplectic\nMomentum Neural Networks (SyMo) as models from a discrete formulation of\nmechanics for non-separable mechanical systems. The combination of such\nformulation leads SyMos to be constrained towards preserving important\ngeometric structures such as momentum and a symplectic form and learn from\nlimited data. Furthermore, it allows to learn dynamics only from the poses as\ntraining data. We extend SyMos to include variational integrators within the\nlearning framework by developing an implicit root-find layer which leads to\nEnd-to-End Symplectic Momentum Neural Networks (E2E-SyMo). Through experimental\nresults, using the pendulum and cartpole we show that such combination not only\nallows these models tol earn from limited data but also provides the models\nwith the capability of preserving the symplectic form and show better long-term\nbehaviour.",

Since the inseparable\nsamples are often mixed with hard samples, current informative sample mining\nstrategies used to deal with inseparable problem may bring up some\nside-effects, such as instability of objective function, etc. To alleviate this\nproblem, we propose a novel distance metric learning algorithm, named adaptive\nneighborhood metric learning (ANML). In ANML, we design two thresholds to\nadaptively identify the inseparable similar and dissimilar samples in the\ntraining procedure, thus inseparable sample removing and metric parameter\nlearning are implemented in the same procedure. Due to the non-continuity of\nthe proposed ANML, we develop an ingenious function, named \\emph{log-exp mean\nfunction} to construct a continuous formulation to surrogate it, which can be\nefficiently solved by the gradient descent method. Similar to Triplet loss,\nANML can be used to learn both the linear and deep embeddings. By analyzing the\nproposed method, we find it has some interesting properties. For example, when\nANML is used to learn the linear embedding, current famous metric learning\nalgorithms such as the large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) and neighbourhood\ncomponents analysis (NCA) are the special cases of the proposed ANML by setting\nthe parameters different values. When it is used to learn deep features, the\nstate-of-the-art deep metric learning algorithms such as Triplet loss, Lifted\nstructure loss, and Multi-similarity loss become the special cases of ANML.\nFurthermore, the \\emph{log-exp mean function} proposed in our method gives a\nnew perspective to review the deep metric learning methods such as Prox-NCA and\nN-pairs loss.

Especially with the increasing\ndigitization of education and interest in large-scale standardized testing, the\npopularity of automatic grading has risen to the point where commercial\nsolutions are widely available and used. However, for short answer formats,\nautomatic grading is challenging due to natural language ambiguity and\nversatility. While automatic short answer grading models are beginning to\ncompare to human performance on some datasets, their robustness, especially to\nadversarially manipulated data, is questionable. Exploitable vulnerabilities in\ngrading models can have far-reaching consequences ranging from cheating\nstudents receiving undeserved credit to undermining automatic grading\naltogether - even when most predictions are valid. In this paper, we devise a\nblack-box adversarial attack tailored to the educational short answer grading\nscenario to investigate the grading models' robustness. In our attack, we\ninsert adjectives and adverbs into natural places of incorrect student answers,\nfooling the model into predicting them as correct. We observed a loss of\nprediction accuracy between 10 and 22 percentage points using the\nstate-of-the-art models BERT and T5. While our attack made answers appear less\nnatural to humans in our experiments, it did not significantly increase the\ngraders' suspicions of cheating.

    "abstract": "Neurocognitive models of higher-level somatosensory processing have\nemphasised the role of stored body representations in interpreting real-time\nsensory signals coming from the body (Longo, Azanon and Haggard, 2010; Tame,\nAzanon and Longo, 2019). The need for such stored representations arises from\nthe fact that immediate sensory signals coming from the body do not specify\nmetric details about body size and shape. Several aspects of somatoperception,\ntherefore, require that immediate sensory signals be combined with stored body\nrepresentations. This basic problem is equally true for humanoid robots and,\nintriguingly, neurocognitive models developed to explain human perception are\nstrikingly similar to those developed independently for localizing touch on\nhumanoid robots, such as the iCub, equipped with artificial electronic skin on\nthe majority of its body surface (Roncone et al., 2014; Hoffmann, 2021). In\nthis chapter, we will review the key features of these models, discuss their\nsimilarities and differences to each other, and to other models in the\nliterature. Using robots as embodied computational models is an example of\nsynthetic methodology or 'understanding by building' (e.g., Hoffmann and\nPfeifer, 2018), computational embodied neuroscience (Caligiore et al., 2010) or\n'synthetic psychology of the self' (Prescott and Camilleri, 2019). Such models\nhave the advantage that they need to be worked out into every detail, making\nany theory explicit and complete. There is also an additional way of\n(pre)validating such a theory other than comparing to the biological or\npsychological phenomenon studied by simply verifying that a particular\nimplementation really performs the task: can the robot localize where it is\nbeing touched (see https://youtu.be/pfse424t5mQ)?",

In this paper, we present a novel\ncontrol scheme that can design an optimal tracking controller using the neural\nnetwork dynamics of the MPC, making it possible to be applied as a\nplug-and-play extension for any existing model-based feedforward controller. We\nalso describe how our method handles a neural network containing historical\ninformation, which does not follow a general form of dynamics. The proposed\nmethod is evaluated by its performance in classical control benchmarks with\nexternal disturbances. We also extend our control framework to be applied in an\naggressive autonomous driving task with unknown friction.

    "abstract": "The decoding performance of product codes (PCs) and staircase codes (SCCs)\nbased on iterative bounded-distance decoding (iBDD) can be improved with the\naid of a moderate amount of soft information, maintaining a low decoding\ncomplexity. One promising approach is error-and-erasure (EaE) decoding, whose\nperformance can be reliably estimated with density evolution (DE). However, the\nextrinsic message passing (EMP) decoder required by the DE analysis entails a\nmuch higher complexity than the simple intrinsic message passing (IMP) decoder.\nIn this paper, we simplify the EMP decoding algorithm for the EaE channel for\ntwo commonly-used EaE decoders by deriving the EMP decoding results from the\nIMP decoder output and some additional logical operations based on the\nalgebraic structure of the component codes and the EaE decoding rule.\nSimulation results show that the number of BDD steps is reduced to being\ncomparable with IMP. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic modification of the\nEMP decoder that reduces the complexity further. In numerical simulations, the\ndecoding performance of the modified decoder yields up to 0.25 dB improvement\ncompared to standard EMP decoding.",

    "abstract": "Background: Vaccination programs are effective only when a significant\npercentage of people are vaccinated. However, vaccine acceptance varies among\ncommunities around the world. Social media usage is arguably one of the factors\naffecting public attitudes towards vaccines. Objective: This study aims to\nidentify if the social media usages factors can be used to predict attitudes\nand behavior towards the COVID-19 vaccines among the people in the Arab world.\nMethods: An online survey was conducted in the Arab countries and 217 Arab\npeople participated in this study. Logistic regression was applied to identify\nwhat demographics and social media usage factors predict public attitudes and\nbehavior towards the COVID-19 vaccines. Results: Of the 217 participants,\n56.22% of them were willing to accept the vaccine and 41.47% of them were\nhesitant. This study shows that none of the social media usages factors were\nsignificant enough to predict the actual vaccine acceptance behavior. Whereas\nthe analysis showed few of the social media usage factors can predict public\nattitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines. For example, frequent social media\nusers were 2.85 times more likely to agree that the risk of COVID-19 is being\nexaggerated (OR=2.85, 95% CI=0.86-9.45, p=0.046) than infrequent social media\nusers. Whereas participants having more trust in vaccine information shared by\ntheir contacts are less likely to agree that decision-makers have verified that\nvaccines are safe (OR=0.528, 95% CI= 0.276-1.012, p=0.05). Conclusion: The use\nof social media and information shared on it may affect public attitudes\ntowards COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, disseminating correct and validated\ninformation about COVID-19 and other vaccines on social media is important for\nincreasing public trust and countering the impact of incorrect and\nmisinformation.",

The recent\nAbduction, Belief Revision and Conceptual Change (ABC) repair system combines\nseveral methods from automated theory repair to expand, contract, or reform\nlogical structures representing conceptual knowledge in artificial agents.

Formally, signature entrenchment measures the inferential\ncontributions of every logical language element used to express conceptual\nknowledge, i.e., predicates and the arguments, ranking possible repairs to\nretain valuable logical concepts and reject redundant or implausible\nalternatives. This quantitative measurement of signature entrenchment offers a\nguide to the plausibility of conceptual changes, which we aim to contrast with\nhuman judgements of concept entrenchment in future work.",

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, a computationally intensive method that\nprovides invaluable insights into the behavior of biomolecules, typically\nrequires large-scale parallelization. Implementation of fast parallel MD\nsimulation demands both high bandwidth and low latency for inter-node\ncommunication, but in current semiconductor technology, neither of these\nproperties is scaling as quickly as intra-node computational capacity. This\ndisparity in scaling necessitates architectural innovations to maximize the\nutilization of computational units. For Anton 3, the latest in a family of\nhighly successful special-purpose supercomputers designed for MD simulations,\nwe thus designed and built a completely new specialized network as part of our\nASIC. Tightly integrating this network with specialized computation pipelines\nenables Anton 3 to perform simulations orders of magnitude faster than any\ngeneral-purpose supercomputer, and to outperform its predecessor, Anton 2 (the\nstate of the art prior to Anton 3), by an order of magnitude. In this paper, we\npresent the three key features of the network that contribute to the high\nperformance of Anton 3. First, through architectural optimizations, the network\nachieves very low end-to-end inter-node communication latency for fine-grained\nmessages, allowing for better overlap of computation and communication. Second,\nnovel application-specific compression techniques reduce the size of most\nmessages sent between nodes, thereby increasing effective inter-node bandwidth.\nLastly, a new hardware synchronization primitive, called a network fence,\nsupports fast fine-grained synchronization tailored to the data flow within a\nparallel MD application. These application-driven specializations to the\nnetwork are critical for Anton 3's MD simulation performance advantage over all\nother machines.",

    "title": "The Role of Gossiping for Information Dissemination over Networked  Agents",
    "abstract": "We consider information dissemination over a network of gossiping agents\n(nodes). In this model, a source keeps the most up-to-date information about a\ntime-varying binary state of the world, and $n$ receiver nodes want to follow\nthe information at the source as accurately as possible. When the information\nat the source changes, the source first sends updates to a subset of $m\\leq n$\nnodes. After that, the nodes share their local information during the gossiping\nperiod to disseminate the information further. The nodes then estimate the\ninformation at the source using the majority rule at the end of the gossiping\nperiod. To analyze information dissemination, we introduce a new error metric\nto find the average percentage of nodes that can accurately obtain the most\nup-to-date information at the source. We characterize the equations necessary\nto obtain the steady-state distribution for the average error and then analyze\nthe system behavior under both high and low gossip rates. In the high gossip\nrate, in which each node can access other nodes' information more frequently,\nwe show that the nodes update their information based on the majority of the\ninformation in the network. In the low gossip rate, we introduce and analyze\nthe gossip gain, which is the reduction at the average error due to gossiping.\nIn particular, we develop an adaptive policy that the source can use to\ndetermine its current transmission capacity $m$ based on its past transmission\nrates and the accuracy of the information at the nodes. In numerical results,\nwe show that when the source's transmission capacity $m$ is limited, gossiping\ncan be harmful as it causes incorrect information to disseminate. We then find\nthe optimal gossip rates to minimize the average error for a fixed $m$.\nFinally, we illustrate the outperformance of our adaptive policy compared to\nthe constant $m$-selection policy even for the high gossip rates.",

Furthermore, commodity OSs such as\nLinux restrict their KASLR range to 32 bits due to architectural constraints\n(e.g., x86-64 only supports 32-bit immediate operands for most instructions),\nwhich makes them vulnerable to even unsophisticated brute-force ROP attacks due\nto low entropy. Most in-kernel pointers remain static, exacerbating the problem\nwhen pointers are leaked.\nAdelie, our kernel defense mechanism, overcomes KASLR limitations, increases\nKASLR entropy, and makes successful ROP attacks on the Linux kernel much harder\nto achieve. First, Adelie enables the position-independent code (PIC) model so\nthat the kernel and its modules can be placed anywhere in the 64-bit virtual\naddress space, at any distance apart from each other. Second, Adelie implements\nstack re-randomization and address encryption on modules. Finally, Adelie\nenables efficient continuous KASLR for modules by using the PIC model to make\nit (almost) impossible to inject ROP gadgets through these modules regardless\nof gadget's origin.\nSince device drivers (typically compiled as modules) are often developed by\nthird parties and are typically less tested than core OS parts, they are also\noften more vulnerable. By fully re-randomizing device drivers, the last two\ncontributions together prevent most JIT ROP attacks since vulnerable modules\nare very likely to be a starting point of an attack. Furthermore, some OS\ninstances in virtualized environments are specifically designated to run device\ndrivers, where drivers are the primary target of JIT ROP attacks. Our\nevaluation shows high efficiency of Adelie's approach.\n[full abstract is in the paper]",

    "abstract": "A range of video modeling tasks, from optical flow to multiple object\ntracking, share the same fundamental challenge: establishing space-time\ncorrespondence. Yet, approaches that dominate each space differ. We take a step\ntowards bridging this gap by extending the recent contrastive random walk\nformulation to much denser, pixel-level space-time graphs. The main\ncontribution is introducing hierarchy into the search problem by computing the\ntransition matrix between two frames in a coarse-to-fine manner, forming a\nmultiscale contrastive random walk when extended in time. This establishes a\nunified technique for self-supervised learning of optical flow, keypoint\ntracking, and video object segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that, for each\nof these tasks, the unified model achieves performance competitive with strong\nself-supervised approaches specific to that task.

    "abstract": "While today's video recognition systems parse snapshots or short clips\naccurately, they cannot connect the dots and reason across a longer range of\ntime yet. Most existing video architectures can only process <5 seconds of a\nvideo without hitting the computation or memory bottlenecks.\nIn this paper, we propose a new strategy to overcome this challenge. Instead\nof trying to process more frames at once like most existing methods, we propose\nto process videos in an online fashion and cache \"memory\" at each iteration.\nThrough the memory, the model can reference prior context for long-term\nmodeling, with only a marginal cost. Based on this idea, we build MeMViT, a\nMemory-augmented Multiscale Vision Transformer, that has a temporal support 30x\nlonger than existing models with only 4.5% more compute; traditional methods\nneed >3,000% more compute to do the same. On a wide range of settings, the\nincreased temporal support enabled by MeMViT brings large gains in recognition\naccuracy consistently. MeMViT obtains state-of-the-art results on the AVA,\nEPIC-Kitchens-100 action classification, and action anticipation datasets. Code\nand models will be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Wearable devices that integrate multiple sensors, processors, and\ncommunication technologies have the potential to transform mobile health for\nremote monitoring of health parameters. However, the small form factor of the\nwearable devices limits the battery size and operating lifetime. As a result,\nthe devices require frequent recharging, which has limited their widespread\nadoption. Energy harvesting has emerged as an effective method towards\nsustainable operation of wearable devices. Unfortunately, energy harvesting\nalone is not sufficient to fulfill the energy requirements of wearable devices.\nThis paper studies the novel problem of adaptive energy management towards the\ngoal of self-sustainable wearables by using harvested energy to supplement the\nbattery energy and to reduce manual recharging by users. To solve this problem,\nwe propose a principled algorithm referred as AdaEM. There are two key ideas\nbehind AdaEM. First, it uses machine learning (ML) methods to learn predictive\nmodels of user activity and energy usage patterns. These models allow us to\nestimate the potential of energy harvesting in a day as a function of the user\nactivities. Second, it reasons about the uncertainty in predictions and\nestimations from the ML models to optimize the energy management decisions\nusing a dynamic robust optimization (DyRO) formulation. We propose a\nlight-weight solution for DyRO to meet the practical needs of deployment. We\nvalidate the AdaEM approach on a wearable device prototype consisting of solar\nand motion energy harvesting using real-world data of user activities.\nExperiments show that AdaEM achieves solutions that are within 5% of the\noptimal with less than 0.005% execution time and energy overhead.",

Deep learning techniques applied to\ninertial signals have proven to be effective, achieving significant\nclassification accuracy. Recently, research in human activity recognition (HAR)\nmodels has been almost totally model-centric. It has been proven that the\nnumber of training samples and their quality are critical for obtaining deep\nlearning models that both perform well independently of their architecture, and\nthat are more robust to intraclass variability and interclass similarity.\nUnfortunately, publicly available datasets do not always contain hight quality\ndata and a sufficiently large and diverse number of samples (e.g., number of\nsubjects, type of activity performed, and duration of trials). Furthermore,\ndatasets are heterogeneous among them and therefore cannot be trivially\ncombined to obtain a larger set. The final aim of our work is the definition\nand implementation of a platform that integrates datasets of inertial signals\nin order to make available to the scientific community large datasets of\nhomogeneous signals, enriched, when possible, with context information (e.g.,\ncharacteristics of the subjects and device position).

In general,\nthe computational error reduction comes at the cost of a sampling overhead due\nto the variance-boosting effect caused by the channel inversion operation,\nwhich ultimately limits the applicability of QEM. Existing sampling overhead\nanalysis of QEM typically assumes exact channel inversion, which is unrealistic\nin practical scenarios. In this treatise, we consider a practical channel\ninversion strategy based on Monte Carlo sampling, which introduces additional\ncomputational error that in turn may be eliminated at the cost of an extra\nsampling overhead. In particular, we show that when the computational error is\nsmall compared to the dynamic range of the error-free results, it scales with\nthe square root of the number of gates. By contrast, the error exhibits a\nlinear scaling with the number of gates in the absence of QEM under the same\nassumptions. Hence, the error scaling of QEM remains to be preferable even\nwithout the extra sampling overhead. Our analytical results are accompanied by\nnumerical examples.",

    "abstract": "The voter process is a classic stochastic process that models the invasion of\na mutant trait $A$ (e.g., a new opinion, belief, legend, genetic mutation,\nmagnetic spin) in a population of agents (e.g., people, genes, particles) who\nshare a resident trait $B$, spread over the nodes of a graph. An agent may\nadopt the trait of one of its neighbors at any time, while the invasion bias\n$r\\in(0,\\infty)$ quantifies the stochastic preference towards ($r>1$) or\nagainst ($r<1$) adopting $A$ over $B$. Success is measured in terms of the\nfixation probability, i.e., the probability that eventually all agents have\nadopted the mutant trait $A$. In this paper we study the problem of fixation\nprobability maximization under this model: given a budget $k$, find a set of\n$k$ agents to initiate the invasion that maximizes the fixation probability. We\nshow that the problem is NP-hard for both $r>1$ and $r<1$, while the latter\ncase is also inapproximable within any multiplicative factor. On the positive\nside, we show that when $r>1$, the optimization function is submodular and thus\ncan be greedily approximated within a factor $1-1/e$. An experimental\nevaluation of some proposed heuristics corroborates our results.",

In this paper, we present an ensemble of\nindependent and parallel long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks for the\nprediction of stock price movement. LSTMs have been shown to be especially\nsuited for time series data due to their ability to incorporate past\ninformation, while neural network ensembles have been found to reduce\nvariability in results and improve generalization. A binary classification\nproblem based on the median of returns is used, and the ensemble's forecast\ndepends on a threshold value, which is the minimum number of LSTMs required to\nagree upon the result. The model is applied to the constituents of the smaller,\nless efficient Stockholm OMX30 instead of other major market indices such as\nthe DJIA and S&P500 commonly found in literature. With a straightforward\ntrading strategy, comparisons with a randomly chosen portfolio and a portfolio\ncontaining all the stocks in the index show that the portfolio resulting from\nthe LSTM ensemble provides better average daily returns and higher cumulative\nreturns over time.

Despite the high accuracy,\nsemidefinite programs are often too slow in practice with poor scalability on\nlarge (or even moderate) datasets. In this paper, we introduce a linear time\ncomplexity algorithm for approximating an SDP relaxed $K$-means clustering. The\nproposed sketch-and-lift (SL) approach solves an SDP on a subsampled dataset\nand then propagates the solution to all data points by a nearest-centroid\nrounding procedure. It is shown that the SL approach enjoys a similar exact\nrecovery threshold as the $K$-means SDP on the full dataset, which is known to\nbe information-theoretically tight under the Gaussian mixture model. The SL\nmethod can be made adaptive with enhanced theoretic properties when the cluster\nsizes are unbalanced. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that the\nstatistical accuracy of the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art fast\nclustering algorithms without sacrificing too much computational efficiency,\nand is comparable to the original $K$-means SDP with substantially reduced\nruntime.",

    "abstract": "Group or cluster structure on explanatory variables in machine learning\nproblems is a very general phenomenon, which has attracted broad interest from\npractitioners and theoreticians alike. In this work we contribute an approach\nto learning under such group structure, that does not require prior information\non the group identities. Our paradigm is motivated by the Laplacian geometry of\nan underlying network with a related community structure, and proceeds by\ndirectly incorporating this into a penalty that is effectively computed via a\nheat flow-based local network dynamics. In fact, we demonstrate a procedure to\nconstruct such a network based on the available data. Notably, we dispense with\ncomputationally intensive pre-processing involving clustering of variables,\nspectral or otherwise. Our technique is underpinned by rigorous theorems that\nguarantee its effective performance and provide bounds on its sample\ncomplexity. In particular, in a wide range of settings, it provably suffices to\nrun the heat flow dynamics for time that is only logarithmic in the problem\ndimensions. We explore in detail the interfaces of our approach with key\nstatistical physics models in network science, such as the Gaussian Free Field\nand the Stochastic Block Model. We validate our approach by successful\napplications to real-world data from a wide array of application domains,\nincluding computer science, genetics, climatology and economics.
