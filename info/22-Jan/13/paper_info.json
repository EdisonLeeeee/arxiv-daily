    "abstract": "We introduce a call-by-name lambda-calculus $\\lambda J$ with generalized\napplications which integrates a notion of distant reduction that allows to\nunblock $\\beta$-redexes without resorting to the permutative conversions of\ngeneralized applications. We show strong normalization of simply typed terms,\nand we then fully characterize strong normalization by means of a quantitative\ntyping system. This characterization uses a non-trivial inductive definition of\nstrong normalization --that we relate to others in the literature--, which is\nbased on a weak-head normalizing strategy. Our calculus relates to explicit\nsubstitution calculi by means of a translation between the two formalisms which\nis faithful, in the sense that it preserves strong normalization. We show that\nour calculus $\\lambda J$ and the well-know calculus $\\Lambda J$ determine\nequivalent notions of strong normalization. As a consequence, $\\Lambda J$\ninherits a faithful translation into explicit substitutions, and its strong\nnormalization can be characterized by the quantitative typing system designed\nfor $\\lambda J$, despite the fact that quantitative subject reduction fails for\npermutative conversions.",

Our scheme makes use of exact and approximate\nalgorithms for the closely related Subset Sum problem, hence any progress over\nthose -- such as the recent improvement due to Bringmann and Nakos [SODA 2021]\n-- carries over to our FPTAS. Depending on the relationship between the size of\nthe input set $n$ and the error margin $\\varepsilon$, we improve upon the best\ncurrently known algorithm of Melissinos and Pagourtzis [COCOON 2018] of\ncomplexity $O(n^4 / \\varepsilon)$. In particular, the exponent of $n$ in our\nproposed scheme may decrease down to $2$, depending on the Subset Sum algorithm\nused. Furthermore, while the aforementioned state of the art complexity,\nexpressed in the form $O((n + 1 / \\varepsilon)^c)$, has constant $c = 5$, our\nresults establish that $c < 5$.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated the catastrophic effects of poor cardinality\nestimates on query processing time. In particular, underestimating query\ncardinality can result in overly optimistic query plans which take orders of\nmagnitude longer to complete than one generated with the true cardinality.\nCardinality bounding avoids this pitfall by computing a strict upper bound on\nthe query's output size using statistics about the database such as table sizes\nand degrees, i.e. value frequencies. In this paper, we extend this line of work\nby proving a novel bound called the Degree Sequence Bound which takes into\naccount the full degree sequences and the max tuple multiplicity. This bound\nimproves upon previous work incorporating degree constraints which focused on\nthe maximum degree rather than the degree sequence.

    "abstract": "Tether-net launched from a chaser spacecraft provides a promising method to\ncapture and dispose of large space debris in orbit. This tether-net system is\nsubject to several sources of uncertainty in sensing and actuation that affect\nthe performance of its net launch and closing control. Earlier\nreliability-based optimization approaches to design control actions however\nremain challenging and computationally prohibitive to generalize over varying\nlaunch scenarios and target (debris) state relative to the chaser. To search\nfor a general and reliable control policy, this paper presents a reinforcement\nlearning framework that integrates a proximal policy optimization (PPO2)\napproach with net dynamics simulations. The latter allows evaluating the\nepisodes of net-based target capture, and estimate the capture quality index\nthat serves as the reward feedback to PPO2. Here, the learned policy is\ndesigned to model the timing of the net closing action based on the state of\nthe moving net and the target, under any given launch scenario. A stochastic\nstate transition model is considered in order to incorporate synthetic\nuncertainties in state estimation and launch actuation. Along with notable\nreward improvement during training, the trained policy demonstrates capture\nperformance (over a wide range of launch/target scenarios) that is close to\nthat obtained with reliability-based optimization run over an individual\nscenario.",

    "abstract": "Whether a population of decision-making individuals will reach a state of\nsatisfactory decisions is a fundamental problem in studying collective\nbehaviors. In the framework of evolutionary game theory and by means of\npotential functions, researchers have established equilibrium convergence under\ndifferent update rules, including best-response and imitation, by imposing\ncertain conditions on agents' utility functions. Then by using the proposed\npotential functions, they have been able to control these populations towards\nsome desired equilibrium. Nevertheless, finding a potential function is often\ndaunting, if not near impossible. We introduce the so-called coordinating agent\nwho tends to switch to a decision only if at least another agent has done so.\nWe prove that any population of coordinating agents, a coordinating population,\nalmost surely equilibrates. Apparently, some binary network games that were\nproven to equilibrate using potential functions are coordinating, and some\ncoloring problems can be solved using this notion. We additionally show that\nany mixed network of agents following best-response, imitation, or rational\nimitation, and associated with coordination payoff matrices is coordinating,\nand hence, equilibrates. As a second contribution, we provide an\nincentive-based control algorithm that leads coordinating populations to a\ndesired equilibrium. The algorithm iteratively maximizes the ratio of the\nnumber of agents choosing the desired decision to the provided incentive. It\nperforms near optimal and as well as specialized algorithms proposed for\nbest-response and imitation; however, it does not require a potential function.\nTherefore, this control algorithm can be readily applied in general situations\nwhere no potential function is yet found for a given decision-making\npopulation.",

    "abstract": "In swimming microorganisms and the cell cytoskeleton, inextensible fibers\nresist bending and twisting, and interact with the surrounding fluid to cause\nor resist large-scale fluid motion. In this paper, we develop a novel numerical\nmethod for the simulation of cylindrical fibers by extending our previous work\non inextensible bending fibers [Maxian et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids 6 (1), 014102]\nto fibers with twist elasticity. In our \"Euler\" model, twist is a scalar\nfunction that measures the deviation of the fiber cross section relative to a\ntwist-free frame, the fiber exerts only torque parallel to the centerline on\nthe fluid, and the perpendicular components of the rotational fluid velocity\nare discarded in favor of the translational velocity. In the first part of this\npaper, we justify this model by comparing it to another commonly-used\n\"Kirchhoff\" formulation where the fiber exerts both perpendicular and parallel\ntorque on the fluid, and the perpendicular angular fluid velocity is required\nto be consistent with the translational fluid velocity. We then develop a\nspectral numerical method for the hydrodynamics of the Euler model. We define\nhydrodynamic mobility operators using integrals of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa\ntensor, and evaluate these integrals through a novel slender-body quadrature,\nwhich requires on the order of 10 points along the fiber to obtain several\ndigits of accuracy. We demonstrate that this choice of mobility removes the\nunphysical negative eigenvalues in the translation-translation mobility\nassociated with asymptotic slender body theories, and ensures strong\nconvergence of the fiber velocity and weak convergence of the fiber constraint\nforces. We pair the spatial discretization with a semi-implicit temporal\nintegrator to confirm the negligible contribution of twist elasticity to the\nrelaxation dynamics of a bent fiber and study the instability of a twirling\nfiber.",

Current practice requires expensive computational costs in model\ntraining for performance prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework for neural network selection by analyzing the governing dynamics over\nsynaptic connections (edges) during training. Our framework is built on the\nfact that back-propagation during neural network training is equivalent to the\ndynamical evolution of synaptic connections. Therefore, a converged neural\nnetwork is associated with an equilibrium state of a networked system composed\nof those edges. To this end, we construct a network mapping $\\phi$, converting\na neural network $G_A$ to a directed line graph $G_B$ that is defined on those\nedges in $G_A$. Next, we derive a neural capacitance metric $\\beta_{\\rm eff}$\nas a predictive measure universally capturing the generalization capability of\n$G_A$ on the downstream task using only a handful of early training results. We\ncarried out extensive experiments using 17 popular pre-trained ImageNet models\nand five benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, Fashion MNIST\nand Birds, to evaluate the fine-tuning performance of our framework.

Service providers can now virtualize the cloud beyond the data\ncenter to meet the latency, data sovereignty, reliability, and interoperability\nrequirements. Yet, many new applications (e.g., augmented reality, virtual\nreality, artificial intelligence) are computation-intensive and\ndelay-sensitivity. These applications are invoked heavily with similar inputs\nthat could lead to the same output. Compute-less networks aim to implement a\nnetwork with a minimum amount of computation and communication.

In this paper, we present matching-based\nservices offloading schemes for compute-less IoT networks. We adopt the\nmatching theory to match service offloading to the appropriate edge server(s).\nSpecifically, we design, WHISTLE, a vertical many-to-many offloading scheme\nthat aims to offload the most invoked and highly reusable services to the\nappropriate edge servers. We further extend WHISTLE to provide horizontal\none-to-many computation reuse sharing among edge servers which leads to\nbouncing less computation back to the cloud. We evaluate the efficiency and\neffectiveness of WHISTLE with a real-world dataset.

However, a key challenge is that IDS systems\nare not perfect, and in complex real-world scenarios may produce incorrect\noutput or fail to work altogether. The field of explainable AI planning (XAIP)\nhas sought to develop techniques that make the decision making of sequential\ndecision making AI systems more explainable to end-users. Critically, prior\nwork in applying XAIP techniques to IDS systems has assumed that the plan being\nproposed by the planner is always optimal, and therefore the action or plan\nbeing recommended as decision support to the user is always correct. In this\nwork, we examine novice user interactions with a non-robust IDS system -- one\nthat occasionally recommends the wrong action, and one that may become\nunavailable after users have become accustomed to its guidance. We introduce a\nnovel explanation type, subgoal-based explanations, for planning-based IDS\nsystems, that supplements traditional IDS output with information about the\nsubgoal toward which the recommended action would contribute. We demonstrate\nthat subgoal-based explanations lead to improved user task performance, improve\nuser ability to distinguish optimal and suboptimal IDS recommendations, are\npreferred by users, and enable more robust user performance in the case of IDS\nfailure",

    "title": "Achieving Differential Privacy with Matrix Masking in Big Data",
    "abstract": "Differential privacy schemes have been widely adopted in recent years to\naddress issues of data privacy protection. We propose a new Gaussian scheme\ncombining with another data protection technique, called random orthogonal\nmatrix masking, to achieve $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-differential privacy (DP)\nmore efficiently. We prove that the additional matrix masking significantly\nreduces the rate of noise variance required in the Gaussian scheme to achieve\n$(\\varepsilon, \\delta)-$DP in big data setting. Specifically, when $\\varepsilon\n\\to 0$, $\\delta \\to 0$, and the sample size $n$ exceeds the number $p$ of\nattributes by $\\frac{n}{p}=O(ln(1/\\delta))$, the required additive noise\nvariance to achieve $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP is reduced from\n$O(ln(1/\\delta)/\\varepsilon^2)$ to $O(1/\\varepsilon)$. With much less noise\nadded, the resulting differential privacy protected pseudo data sets allow much\nmore accurate inferences, thus can significantly improve the scope of\napplication for differential privacy.",

    "abstract": "Motion tracking systems based on optical sensors typically often suffer from\nissues, such as poor lighting conditions, occlusion, limited coverage, and may\nraise privacy concerns. More recently, radio frequency (RF)-based approaches\nusing commercial WiFi devices have emerged which offer low-cost ubiquitous\nsensing whilst preserving privacy. However, the output of an RF sensing system,\nsuch as Range-Doppler spectrograms, cannot represent human motion intuitively\nand usually requires further processing. In this study, MDPose, a novel\nframework for human skeletal motion reconstruction based on WiFi micro-Doppler\nsignatures, is proposed. It provides an effective solution to track human\nactivities by reconstructing a skeleton model with 17 key points, which can\nassist with the interpretation of conventional RF sensing outputs in a more\nunderstandable way. Specifically, MDPose has various incremental stages to\ngradually address a series of challenges: First, a denoising algorithm is\nimplemented to remove any unwanted noise that may affect the feature extraction\nand enhance weak Doppler signatures. Secondly, the convolutional neural network\n(CNN)-recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture is applied to learn\ntemporal-spatial dependency from clean micro-Doppler signatures and restore key\npoints' velocity information. Finally, a pose optimising mechanism is employed\nto estimate the initial state of the skeleton and to limit the increase of\nerror. We have conducted comprehensive tests in a variety of environments using\nnumerous subjects with a single receiver radar system to demonstrate the\nperformance of MDPose, and report 29.4mm mean absolute error over all key\npoints positions, which outperforms state-of-the-art RF-based pose estimation\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an online voltage control strategy of distributed energy\nresources (DERs), based on the projected Newton method (PNM), for unbalanced\ndistribution networks. The optimal Volt/VAr control (VVC) problem is formulated\nas an optimization program, with the goal of maintaining the voltage profile\nacross the network by coordinating the VAr outputs of DERs. To overcome the\nslow convergence rate of conventional gradient-based methods, a PNM-based\nsolution algorithm is developed to solve this VVC problem. It utilizes a\nnon-diagonal symmetric positive definite matrix, developed from the Hessian\nmatrix of the objective, to scale the gradient, and thus a fast convergence\nperformance can be expected in this Newton-like algorithm. Moreover, taking\nadvantage of the instantaneous feedback of voltage measurements, the online\nimplementation of the PNM-based VVC is further designed to deal with fast\nsystem variations. In this online PNM-based VVC scheme, each bus agent\ncommunicates the instantaneous voltage measurements to the central agent, and\nthe central agent communicates the VAr output commands of DERs back to each bus\nagent. The fast convergence performance of PNM results in a stronger capability\nto track the system variations in real time. Finally, numerical case studies\nare performed to validate the effectiveness, superiority, and scalability of\nthe proposed method.",

To validate if social media engagement signals correlate with actual web\nvisit counts, we collect all Facebook and Twitter posts with URLs from TGP\nduring the same time period.

In this work, we investigate methods for predicting the\ntarget domain accuracy using only labeled source data and unlabeled target\ndata.

ATC outperforms previous methods across several model architectures,\ntypes of distribution shifts (e.g., due to synthetic corruptions, dataset\nreproduction, or novel subpopulations), and datasets (Wilds, ImageNet, Breeds,\nCIFAR, and MNIST). In our experiments, ATC estimates target performance\n$2$-$4\\times$ more accurately than prior methods. We also explore the\ntheoretical foundations of the problem, proving that, in general, identifying\nthe accuracy is just as hard as identifying the optimal predictor and thus, the\nefficacy of any method rests upon (perhaps unstated) assumptions on the nature\nof the shift. Finally, analyzing our method on some toy distributions, we\nprovide insights concerning when it works.",

    "abstract": "Mobile devices increasingly rely on object detection (OD) through deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) to perform critical tasks. Due to their high complexity, the\nexecution of these DNNs requires excessive time and energy. Low-complexity\nobject tracking (OT) can be used with OD, where the latter is periodically\napplied to generate \"fresh\" references for tracking. However, the frames\nprocessed with OD incur large delays, which may make the reference outdated and\ndegrade tracking quality. Herein, we propose to use edge computing in this\ncontext, and establish parallel OT (at the mobile device) and OD (at the edge\nserver) processes that are resilient to large OD latency. We propose Katch-Up,\na novel tracking mechanism that improves the system resilience to excessive OD\ndelay. However, while Katch-Up significantly improves performance, it also\nincreases the computing load of the mobile device. Hence, we design SmartDet, a\nlow-complexity controller based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that\nlearns controlling the trade-off between resource utilization and OD\nperformance. SmartDet takes as input context-related information related to the\ncurrent video content and the current network conditions to optimize frequency\nand type of OD offloading, as well as Katch-Up utilization. We extensively\nevaluate SmartDet on a real-world testbed composed of a JetSon Nano as mobile\ndevice and a GTX 980 Ti as edge server, connected through a Wi-Fi link.\nExperimental results show that SmartDet achieves an optimal balance between\ntracking performance - mean Average Recall (mAR) and resource usage. With\nrespect to a baseline with full Katch-Upusage and maximum channel usage, we\nstill increase mAR by 4% while using 50% less of the channel and 30% power\nresources associated with Katch-Up.

In this regard, we have updated the\nChung-Lu algorithm to guarantee the communication network connectivity and to\nmatch the degree distribution of a real-world smart grid rather than following\nan expected degree distribution. In addition, key characteristics of\ncommunication systems such as diameter, average shortest paths, clustering\ncoefficients, assortativity, and spectral gap were taken into consideration to\ngenerate the most similar real-world communication network for smart grid\nstudies.

    "abstract": "The envisioned 6G networks are expected to support extremely high data rates,\nlow-latency, and radically new applications empowered by machine learning. The\nfuturistic 6G networks require a novel framework that can be used to operate,\nmanage, and optimize its underlying services such as ultra-reliable and\nlow-latency communication, and Internet of everything. In recent years,\nartificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant success in optimizing\nand designing networks. The AI-enabled traffic orchestration can dynamically\norganize different network architectures and slices to provide quality of\nexperience considering the dynamic nature of the wireless communication\nnetwork.\nIn this paper, we propose a digital twin enabled network framework, empowered\nby AI to cater the variability and complexity of envisioned 6G networks, to\nprovide smart resource management and intelligent service provisioning. Digital\ntwin paves a way for achieving optimizing 6G services by creating a virtual\nrepresentation of the 6G network along with its associated communication\ntechnologies (e.g., intelligent reflecting surfaces, terahertz and millimeter\ncommunication), computing systems (e.g., cloud computing and fog computing)\nwith its associated algorithms (e.g., optimization and machine learning). We\nthen discuss and review the existing AI-enabled traffic management and\norchestration techniques and highlight future research directions and potential\nsolutions in 6G networks.",

We review existing contiguous cartogram software and compare two\nweb-based cartogram tools: fBlog and go-cart.io. We experimentally evaluated\ntheir usability with a user study comprising cartogram generation and analysis\ntasks. We adopted the System Usability Scale to quantify how participants\nperceived the usability of both tools.

While previous studies assert that a virtual\nroom's size affects relative translation gain thresholds on account of the\nvirtual horizon's location, additional research is needed to explore this\nassumption through a structured approach to visual perception in Virtual\nReality (VR). We estimate the relative translation gain thresholds in six\nspatial conditions configured by three room sizes and the presence of virtual\nobjects (3 X 2), which were set according to differing Angles of Declination\n(AoDs) between eye-gaze and the forward-gaze. Results show that both size and\nvirtual objects significantly affect the threshold range, it being greater in\nthe large-sized condition and furnished condition. This indicates that the\neffect of relative translation gains can be further increased by constructing a\nperceived virtual movable space that is even larger than the adjusted virtual\nmovable space and placing objects in it. Our study can be applied to adjust\nvirtual spaces in synchronizing heterogeneous spaces without coordinate\ndistortion where real and virtual objects can be leveraged to create realistic\nmutual spaces.",

Toward the end of better\nunderstanding and mitigating these attacks, we present a set of machine\nlearning models that learn from localized news data in order to predict whether\na terrorist attack will occur on a given calendar date and in a given state.\nThe best model--a Random Forest that learns from a novel variable-length moving\naverage representation of the feature space--achieves area under the receiver\noperating characteristic scores $> .667$ on four of the five states that were\nimpacted most by terrorism between 2015 and 2018. Our key findings include that\nmodeling terrorism as a set of independent events, rather than as a continuous\nprocess, is a fruitful approach--especially when the events are sparse and\ndissimilar. Additionally, our results highlight the need for localized models\nthat account for differences between locations. From a machine learning\nperspective, we found that the Random Forest model outperformed several deep\nmodels on our multimodal, noisy, and imbalanced data set, thus demonstrating\nthe efficacy of our novel feature representation method in such a context. We\nalso show that its predictions are relatively robust to time gaps between\nattacks and observed characteristics of the attacks. Finally, we analyze\nfactors that limit model performance, which include a noisy feature space and\nsmall amount of available data.

    "abstract": "Firms in inter-organizational networks such as supply chains or strategic\nalliances are exposed to interdependent risks. Interdependent risks are risks\nthat are transferable across partner firms, such as contamination in food\nsupply chains or data breaches in technology networks. They can be decomposed\ninto intrinsic risks a firm faces from its own operations and extrinsic risks\ntransferred from its partners. Firms broadly have access to two security\nstrategies: either they can independently eliminate both intrinsic and\nextrinsic risks by securing their links with partners, or alternatively, firms\ncan cooperate with partners to eliminate sources of intrinsic risk in the\nnetwork. First, we develop a graph-theoretic model of interdependent risk and\ndemonstrate that the network-optimal security strategy can be computed in\npolynomial time via a weighted min-cut network flow algorithm. Then, we use\ncooperative game-theoretic tools to examine whether and when firms can sustain\nthe network-optimal security strategy via cost-sharing mechanisms that are\nstable, fair, computable, and implementable via a series of bilateral\ncost-sharing arrangements. By analyzing commonly employed allocation\nmechanisms, we uncover a trilemma, that is, it is, in general, challenging to\nidentify cost-sharing mechanisms that are stable, fair, and implementable. We\nthen design a novel cost-sharing mechanism: a restricted variant of the\nwell-known Shapley value, the agreeable allocation, that is easy to compute,\nbilaterally implementable, belongs to the core, and is fair in a well-defined\nsense. However, the agreeable allocation need not always exist. Interestingly,\nwe find that in networks with homogeneous cost parameters, the presence of\nlocally dense clusters of connected firms precludes the existence of the\nagreeable allocation, while the absence of sufficiently dense clusters\nguarantees its existence.",

Coverage path planning (CPP) significantly influences the accuracy\nand efficiency of robotic quality inspection. Traditional CPP strategies focus\non minimizing the number of viewpoints or traveling distance of robots under\nthe condition of full coverage inspection. The measurement uncertainty when\ncollecting the scanning data is less considered in the free-form surface\ninspection. To address this problem, a novel CPP method with the optimal\nviewpoint sampling strategy is proposed to incorporate the measurement\nuncertainty of key measurement points (MPs) into free-form surface inspection.\nAt first, the feasible ranges of measurement uncertainty are calculated based\non the tolerance specifications of the MPs. The initial feasible viewpoint set\nis generated considering the measurement uncertainty and the visibility of MPs.\nThen, the inspection cost function is built to evaluate the number of selected\nviewpoints and the average measurement uncertainty in the field of views (FOVs)\nof all the selected viewpoints. Afterward, an enhanced rapidly-exploring random\ntree (RRT*) algorithm is proposed for viewpoint sampling using the inspection\ncost function and CPP optimization.

    "abstract": "Real-time robot motion planning in complex high-dimensional environments\nremains an open problem. Motion planning algorithms, and their underlying\ncollision checkers, are crucial to any robot control stack. Collision checking\ntakes up a large portion of computational time in robot motion planning.\nExisting collision checkers make trade-offs between speed and accuracy and\nscale poorly to high-dimensional, complex environments. We present a novel\nspace decomposition method using K-Means clustering in the Forward Kinematics\nspace to accelerate proxy collision checking. We train individual configuration\nspace models using Fastron, a kernel perceptron algorithm, on these decomposed\nsubspaces, yielding lightweight yet highly accurate models that can be queried\nrapidly and scale better to more complex environments. We demonstrate this new\nmethod, called Decomposed Fast Perceptron (D-Fastron), on the 7-DOF Baxter\nrobot producing on average 29x faster collision checks and up to 9.8x faster\nmotion planning compared to state-of-the-art geometric collision checkers.",

In this paper, we suggest a novel INR approach to representing and\ncompressing videos by explicitly removing data redundancy. Instead of storing\nraw RGB colors, we propose Neural Residual Flow Fields (NRFF), using motion\ninformation across video frames and residuals that are necessary to reconstruct\na video. Maintaining the motion information, which is usually smoother and less\ncomplex than the raw signals, requires far fewer parameters. Furthermore,\nreusing redundant pixel values further improves the network parameter\nefficiency.

We find that unsatisfactory\nperformance is mainly due to the static token embeddings biases and the\nineffective BERT layers, rather than the high cosine similarity of the sentence\nembeddings. To this end, we propose a prompt based sentence embeddings method\nwhich can reduce token embeddings biases and make the original BERT layers more\neffective. By reformulating the sentence embeddings task as the\nfillin-the-blanks problem, our method significantly improves the performance of\noriginal BERT. We discuss two prompt representing methods and three prompt\nsearching methods for prompt based sentence embeddings.

The data on two novel measures estimating a\ntext's literariness, intratextual variance and stepwise distance (van\nCranenburgh et al., 2019) revealed that plays are the most literary texts in\nGLEC, followed by poems and novels. Computation of a novel index of text\ncreativity (Gray et al., 2016) revealed poems and plays as the most creative\ncategories with the most creative authors all being poets (Milton, Pope, Keats,\nByron, or Wordsworth). We also computed a novel index of perceived beauty of\nverbal art (Kintsch, 2012) for the works in GLEC and predict that Emma is the\ntheoretically most beautiful of Austen's novels. Finally, we demonstrate that\nthese novel measures of semantic complexity are important features for text\nclassification and authorship recognition with overall predictive accuracies in\nthe range of .75 to .97.

One such characteristic is the\ninherent combinatorial nature of the graphs involved. The graphs consist of\nmany connected components, representing individual molecules. While the\nexisting methods for implementing graph transformations can be applied to such\ngraphs, the combinatorics of constructing graph matches quickly becomes a\ncomputational bottleneck as the size of the chemical reaction network grows.\nIn this contribution, we develop a new method of enumerating graph\ntransformation rule applications, designed to improve performance in these\nscenarios. The method is based on constructing graph matches component-wise, in\nan iterative fashion, allowing redundant applications to be detected early and\npruned.\nWe further extend the algorithm with an efficient heuristic, based on local\nsymmetries of the graphs, which allow us to detect and discard isomorphic\napplications early. Finally, we conduct chemical network generation experiments\non real-life as well as synthetic data and compare against state-of-the-art in\nthe field.",

    "abstract": "In the practical application of restoring low-resolution gray-scale images,\nwe generally need to run three separate processes of image colorization,\nsuper-resolution, and dows-sampling operation for the target device. However,\nthis pipeline is redundant and inefficient for the independent processes, and\nsome inner features could have been shared. Therefore, we present an efficient\nparadigm to perform {S}imultaneously Image {C}olorization and\n{S}uper-resolution (SCS) and propose an end-to-end SCSNet to achieve this goal.\nThe proposed method consists of two parts: colorization branch for learning\ncolor information that employs the proposed plug-and-play \\emph{Pyramid Valve\nCross Attention} (PVCAttn) module to aggregate feature maps between source and\nreference images; and super-resolution branch for integrating color and texture\ninformation to predict target images, which uses the designed \\emph{Continuous\nPixel Mapping} (CPM) module to predict high-resolution images at continuous\nmagnification. Furthermore, our SCSNet supports both automatic and referential\nmodes that is more flexible for practical application. Abundant experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method for generating authentic images over\nstate-of-the-art methods, e.g., averagely decreasing FID by 1.8$\\downarrow$ and\n5.1 $\\downarrow$ compared with current best scores for automatic and\nreferential modes, respectively, while owning fewer parameters (more than\n$\\times$2$\\downarrow$) and faster running speed (more than\n$\\times$3$\\uparrow$).",

    "abstract": "As technology process node scales down, on-chip SRAM caches lose their\nefficiency because of their low scalability, high leakage power, and increasing\nrate of soft errors. Among emerging memory technologies, Spin-Transfer Torque\nMagnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) is known as the most promising replacement for\nSRAM-based cache memories. The main advantages of STT-MRAM are its\nnon-volatility, near-zero leakage power, higher density, soft-error immunity,\nand higher scalability. Despite these advantages, the high error rate in\nSTT-MRAM cells due to retention failure, write failure, and read disturbance\nthreatens the reliability of cache memories built upon STT-MRAM technology. The\nerror rate is significantly increased in higher temperatures, which further\naffects the reliability of STT-MRAM-based cache memories. The major source of\nheat generation and temperature increase in STT-MRAM cache memories is write\noperations, which are managed by cache replacement policy. In this paper, we\nfirst analyze the cache behavior in the conventional LRU replacement policy and\ndemonstrate that the majority of consecutive write operations (more than 66%)\nare committed to adjacent cache blocks. These adjacent write operations cause\naccumulated heat and increased temperature, which significantly increases the\ncache error rate. To eliminate heat accumulation and the adjacency of\nconsecutive writes, we propose a cache replacement policy, named Thermal-Aware\nLeast-Recently Written (TA-LRW), to smoothly distribute the generated heat by\nconducting consecutive write operations in distant cache blocks. TA-LRW\nguarantees the distance of at least three blocks for each two consecutive write\noperations in an 8-way associative cache. This distant write scheme reduces the\ntemperature-induced error rate by 94.8%, on average, compared with the\nconventional LRU policy, which results in 6.9x reduction in cache error rate.",

Recent works prefer to formulate frame sampling as a sequential\ndecision task by selecting frames one by one according to their importance,\nwhile we present a new paradigm of learning instance-specific video\ncondensation policies to select informative frames for representing the entire\nvideo only in a single step. Our basic motivation is that the efficient video\nrecognition task lies in processing a whole sequence at once rather than\npicking up frames sequentially. Accordingly, these policies are derived from a\nlight-weighted skim network together with a simple yet effective policy network\nwithin one step. Moreover, we extend the proposed method with a frame number\nbudget, enabling the framework to produce correct predictions in high\nconfidence with as few frames as possible. Experiments on four benchmarks,\ni.e., ActivityNet, Mini-Kinetics, FCVID, Mini-Sports1M, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our OCSampler over previous methods in terms of accuracy,\ntheoretical computational expense, actual inference speed. We also evaluate its\ngeneralization power across different classifiers, sampled frames, and search\nspaces.

However, the utilization of these deep models is\nlimited in many aspects, such as lack of explainability and being incompatible\nwith the existing inverted index systems. Above all, the PLMs based\nrecommenders are inefficient, as the encoding of user-side information will\ntake huge computation costs. Although the computation can be accelerated with\nefficient transformers or distilled PLMs, it is still not enough to make timely\nrecommendations for the active users, who are associated with super long news\nbrowsing histories.\nIn this work, we tackle the efficient news recommendation problem from a\ndistinctive perspective. Instead of relying on the entire input (i.e., the\ncollection of news articles a user ever browsed), we argue that the user's\ninterest can be fully captured merely with those representative keywords.\nMotivated by this, we propose GateFormer, where the input data is gated before\nfeeding into transformers. The gating module is made personalized, lightweight\nand end-to-end learnable, such that it may perform accurate and efficient\nfiltering of informative user input. GateFormer achieves highly impressive\nperformances in experiments, where it notably outperforms the existing\nacceleration approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.

In such object-oblivious flash devices, concurrent writes\nfrom different objects are simply packed in their arrival order to flash memory\nblocks; hence objects with different lifetimes are multiplexed onto the same\nflash blocks. This multiplexing incurs write amplification, worsening the\nperformance. Tackling the multiplexing problem, we propose a novel interface\nfor flash storage, FlashAlloc. It is used to pass the logical address ranges of\nlogical objects to the flash storage and thus enlighten the storage to stream\nwrites by objects. The object-aware flash storage can de-multiplex writes from\ndifferent objects with distinct deathtimes into per-object dedicated flash\nblocks. Given that popular data stores separate writes using objects (e.g.,\nSSTables in RocksDB), we can achieve, unlike the existing solutions,\ntransparent write streaming just by calling FlashAlloc upon object creation.\nOur experimental results using an open-source SSD prototype demonstrate that\nFlashAlloc can reduce write amplification factor (WAF) in RocksDB, F2FS, and\nMySQL by 1.5, 2.5, and 0.3, respectively and thus improve throughput by 2x,\n1.8x, and 1.2x, respectively.

    "abstract": "There is a recent proliferation of research on the integration of machine\nlearning and optimization. One expansive area within this research stream is\npredictive-model embedded optimization, which uses pre-trained predictive\nmodels for the objective function of an optimization problem, so that features\nof the predictive models become decision variables in the optimization problem.\nDespite a recent surge in publications in this area, one aspect of this\ndecision-making pipeline that has been largely overlooked is training\nrelevance, i.e., ensuring that solutions to the optimization problem should be\nsimilar to the data used to train the predictive models. In this paper, we\npropose constraints designed to enforce training relevance, and show through a\ncollection of experimental results that adding the suggested constraints\nsignificantly improves the quality of solutions obtained.",

In addition, fifteen\ncombinations of multiple tasks are evaluated by a graph attention-based\nadversarial multi-task learning framework in two drug discovery scenarios. The\nresults suggest two important findings. (1) The combinations of multimodal\ntasks achieve the best performance compared to other multi-task joint\nstrategies. (2) The joint training of local and global SSL tasks yields higher\nperformance than random task combinations.

    "title": "Path Transitions Tell More:Optimizing Fuzzing Schedules via Runtime  Program States",
    "abstract": "Coverage-guided Greybox Fuzzing (CGF) is one of the most successful and\nwidely-used techniques for bug hunting. Two major approaches are adopted to\noptimize CGF: (i) to reduce search space of inputs by inferring relationships\nbetween input bytes and path constraints; (ii) to formulate fuzzing processes\n(e.g., path transitions) and build up probability distributions to optimize\npower schedules, i.e., the number of inputs generated per seed. However, the\nformer is subjective to the inference results which may include extra bytes for\na path constraint, thereby limiting the efficiency of path constraints\nresolution, code coverage discovery, and bugs exposure; the latter\nformalization, concentrating on power schedules for seeds alone, is inattentive\nto the schedule for bytes in a seed. In this paper, we propose a lightweight\nfuzzing approach, Truzz, to optimize existing Coverage-guided Greybox Fuzzers\n(CGFs). To address two aforementioned challenges, Truzz identifies the bytes\nrelated to the validation checks (i.e., the checks guarding error-handling\ncode), and protects those bytes from being frequently mutated, making most\ngenerated inputs examine the functionalities of programs, in lieu of being\nrejected by validation checks. The byte-wise relationship determination\nmitigates the problem of loading extra bytes when fuzzers infer the\nbyte-constraint relation. Furthermore, the proposed path transition within\nTruzz can efficiently prioritize the seed as the new path, harvesting many new\nedges, and the new path likely belongs to a code region with many undiscovered\ncode lines. The experimental results show that on average, Truzz can generate\n16.14% more inputs flowing into functional code, in addition to 24.75% more new\nedges than the vanilla fuzzers. Finally, our approach exposes 13 bugs in 8\ntarget programs, and 6 of them have not been identified by the vanilla fuzzers.",

This\nstudy aims to assess how transferable are the features between different\ndomains of time series data and under which conditions. The effects of transfer\nlearning are observed in terms of predictive performance of the models and\ntheir convergence rate during training. In our experiment, we use reduced data\nsets of 1,500 and 9,000 data instances to mimic real world conditions.

Four machine learning models were used for the experiment. Transfer of\nknowledge was performed within the same domain of application (seismology), as\nwell as between mutually different domains of application (seismology, speech,\nmedicine, finance). We observe the predictive performance of the models and the\nconvergence rate during the training. In order to confirm the validity of the\nobtained results, we repeated the experiments seven times and applied\nstatistical tests to confirm the significance of the results.

Recently, with the release\nof BERT, word embeddings have moved from the term-based embedding space to the\ncontextual embedding space -- each term is no longer represented by a single\nlow-dimensional vector but instead each term and \\emph{its context} determine\nthe vector weights. BERT's setup and architecture have been shown to be general\nenough to be applicable to many natural language tasks. Importantly for\nInformation Retrieval (IR), in contrast to prior deep learning solutions to IR\nproblems which required significant tuning of neural net architectures and\ntraining regimes, \"vanilla BERT\" has been shown to outperform existing\nretrieval algorithms by a wide margin, including on tasks and corpora that have\nlong resisted retrieval effectiveness gains over traditional IR baselines (such\nas Robust04). In this paper, we employ the recently proposed axiomatic dataset\nanalysis technique -- that is, we create diagnostic datasets that each fulfil a\nretrieval heuristic (both term matching and semantic-based) -- to explore what\nBERT is able to learn. In contrast to our expectations, we find BERT, when\napplied to a recently released large-scale web corpus with ad-hoc topics, to\n\\emph{not} adhere to any of the explored axioms.

    "abstract": "In this work, we present an approach for monocular hand-eye calibration from\nper-sensor ego-motion based on dual quaternions. Due to non-metrically scaled\ntranslations of monocular odometry, a scaling factor has to be estimated in\naddition to the rotation and translation calibration. For this, we derive a\nquadratically constrained quadratic program that allows a combined estimation\nof all extrinsic calibration parameters. Using dual quaternions leads to low\nrun-times due to their compact representation. Our problem formulation further\nallows to estimate multiple scalings simultaneously for different sequences of\nthe same sensor setup. Based on our problem formulation, we derive both, a fast\nlocal and a globally optimal solving approach. Finally, our algorithms are\nevaluated and compared to state-of-the-art approaches on simulated and\nreal-world data, e.g., the EuRoC MAV dataset.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of characterizing the first arrival position (FAP)\ndensity in molecular communication (MC) with a diffusion-advection channel that\npermits a constant drift velocity pointed to arbitrary direction. The advantage\nof FAP modulation lies in the fact that it could encode more information into\nhigher dimensional spatial variables, compared to other modulation techniques\nusing time or molecule numbers. However, effective methods to characterize the\nFAP density in a general framework do not exist. In this paper, we devise a\nmethodology that fully resolves the FAP density with planar absorbing receivers\nin arbitrary dimensions.

    "abstract": "Several solutions for specifying normative artefacts (norms, contracts,\npolicies) in a computational processable way have been presented in the\nliterature. Legal core ontologies have been proposed to systematize concepts\nand relationships relevant to normative reasoning. However, no solution amongst\nthose has achieved general acceptance, and no common ground (representational,\ncomputational) has been identified enabling us to easily compare them. Yet, all\nthese efforts share the same motivation of representing normative directives,\ntherefore it is plausible that there may be a representational model\nencompassing all of them. This presentation will introduce DPCL, a\ndomain-specific language (DSL) for specifying higher-level policies (including\nnorms, contracts, etc.), centred on Hohfeld's framework of fundamental legal\nconcepts. DPCL has to be seen primarily as a \"template\", i.e. as an\ninformational model for architectural reference, rather than a fully-fledged\nformal language; it aims to make explicit the general requirements that should\nbe expected in a language for norm specification. In this respect, it goes\nrather in the direction of legal core ontologies, but differently from those,\nour proposal aims to keep the character of a DSL, rather than a set of axioms\nin a logical framework: it is meant to be cross-compiled to underlying\nlanguages/tools adequate to the type of target application.

The study of P2G plants\nconnected to a transmission network used to offer flexibility to the\nTransmission System Operator (TSO) has been extensively analyzed in the\nliterature. Instead, the analysis of these systems used within the distribution\nnetworks has only been dealt with in a few studies.

    "abstract": "Understanding the scene is key for autonomously navigating vehicles and the\nability to segment the surroundings online into moving and non-moving objects\nis a central ingredient for this task. Often, deep learning-based methods are\nused to perform moving object segmentation (MOS). The performance of these\nnetworks, however, strongly depends on the diversity and amount of labeled\ntraining data, information that may be costly to obtain. In this paper, we\npropose an automatic data labeling pipeline for 3D LiDAR data to save the\nextensive manual labeling effort and to improve the performance of existing\nlearning-based MOS systems by automatically generating labeled training data.\nOur proposed approach achieves this by processing the data offline in batches.\nIt first exploits an occupancy-based dynamic object removal to detect possible\ndynamic objects coarsely. Second, it extracts segments among the proposals and\ntracks them using a Kalman filter. Based on the tracked trajectories, it labels\nthe actually moving objects such as driving cars and pedestrians as moving. In\ncontrast, the non-moving objects, e.g., parked cars, lamps, roads, or\nbuildings, are labeled as static. We show that this approach allows us to label\nLiDAR data highly effectively and compare our results to those of other label\ngeneration methods. We also train a deep neural network with our auto-generated\nlabels and achieve similar performance compared to the one trained with manual\nlabels on the same data, and an even better performance when using additional\ndatasets with labels generated by our approach. Furthermore, we evaluate our\nmethod on multiple datasets using different sensors and our experiments\nindicate that our method can generate labels in diverse environments.",

In reinforcement learning (RL) a planning agent has its own\nrepresentation of the environment as a model. To discover an optimal policy to\ninteract with the environment, the agent collects experience in a trial and\nerror fashion. Experience can be used for learning a better model or improve\ndirectly the value function and policy. Typically separated, Dyna-Q is an\nhybrid approach which, at each iteration, exploits the real experience to\nupdate the model as well as the value function, while planning its action using\nsimulated data from its model. However, the planning process is computationally\nexpensive and strongly depends on the dimensionality of the state-action space.\nWe propose to build a Upper Confidence Tree (UCT) on the simulated experience\nand search for the best action to be selected during the on-line learning\nprocess. We prove the effectiveness of our proposed method on a set of\npreliminary tests on three testbed environments from Open AI.

Then,\neach communication user receives multiple multicast streams and one desired\nunicast stream, which are detected via successive interference cancellation\n(SIC). Based on the proposed framework, a multiple-objective optimization\nproblem (MOOP) is formulated for designing the transmit beamforming, which\ncharacterizes the communication-sensing trade-off. For general the\nmultiple-user scenario, the formulated MOOP is converted to a single-objective\noptimization problem (SOOP) via the e-constraint method. Then, a block\ncoordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is proposed by employing fractional\nprogramming (FP) and successive convex approximation (SCA) to find a suboptimal\nsolution. For the special single-user scenario, the globally optimal solution\ncan be obtained by transforming the MOOP to a quadratic semidefinite program\n(QSDP). Moreover, it is rigorously proved that 1) in the multiple-user\nscenario, the proposed framework always outperform the\nsensing-interference-cancellation (SenIC) ISAC frameworks by further exploiting\nsensing signal for delivering information; 2) in the single-user scenario, the\nproposed framework achieves the same performance as the existing SenIC ISAC\nframeworks, which reveals that the sensing interference coordination is not\nrequired in this case. Numerical results verify the theoretical results and\nshow that exploiting one beam of the sensing signal for delivering multicast\ninformation is sufficient for the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "A key issue in federated learning over wireless channels is how to exchange a\nlarge number of the model parameters via time-varying channels. Two types of\nsolutions based on digital and analog schemes are used typically. The\ndigital-based solution takes quantization and entropy coding for compression,\nwhereas transmissions via wireless channels may cause catastrophic errors owing\nto the all-or-nothing behavior in entropy coding. The analog-based solutions\nsuch as AirNet and AirComp use analog modulation for the parameter\ntransmissions. However, such an analog scheme often causes significant\ndistortion due to the source signal's large power without compression gain.\nThis paper proposes a novel hybrid digital-analog transmission-Federated\nAirNet--for the model parameter transmissions in federated learning. The\nFederated AirNet integrates low-rate digital coding and energy-compact analog\nmodulation. The digital coding offers the baseline of the model parameters and\ncompacts the source signal power. In addition, the residual parameters, which\nare obtained from the original and encoded model parameters, are\nanalog-modulated to enhance the baseline according to the instantaneous\nwireless channel quality. We show that the proposed Federated AirNet yields\nbetter image classification accuracy compared with the digital-based and\nanalog-based solutions over a wide range of wireless channel signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs).",

One question that several\nrecent works have addressed is how a software project's size and structure\ninfluence team productivity, a question famously considered in Brooks' law.\nRecent studies using massive repository data suggest that developers in larger\nteams tend to be less productive than smaller teams. Despite using similar\nmethods and data, other studies argue for a positive linear or even\nsuper-linear relationship between team size and productivity, thus contesting\nthe view of software economics that software projects are diseconomies of\nscale.

Furthermore, these catalogs constitute a reference\nguide for communication between practitioners since they standardize a common\nrefactoring vocabulary. Fowler's seminal book on refactoring describes the most\npopular catalog of refactorings, which documents single and well-known\nrefactoring operations. However, sometimes refactorings are composite\ntransformations, i.e., a sequence of refactorings performed over a given\nprogram element. For example, a sequence of Extract Method operations (a single\nrefactoring) can be performed over the same method, in one or in multiple\ncommits, to simplify its implementation, therefore, leading to a Method\nDecomposition operation (a composite refactoring). In this paper, we propose\nand document a catalog with six composite refactorings. We also extend a\nrefactoring detection tool to identify such composite refactoring in commits\nhistories. We rely on our tool extension to mine composite refactorings in ten\nwell-known open source projects and characterize the detected composite\nrefactorings, under dimensions such as size and location. Finally, we\nqualitatively study the descriptions of commits including composite\nrefactorings to shed preliminary light on the motivations behind such\noperations.

In this work, we perform the first systematic\nstudy of semantic security vulnerabilities specific to overly-conservative AD\nbehavioral planning behaviors, i.e., those that can cause failed or\nsignificantly-degraded mission performance, which can be critical for AD\nservices such as robo-taxi/delivery. We call them semantic Denial-of-Service\n(DoS) vulnerabilities, which we envision to be most generally exposed in\npractical AD systems due to the tendency for conservativeness to avoid safety\nincidents. To achieve high practicality and realism, we assume that the\nattacker can only introduce seemingly-benign external physical objects to the\ndriving environment, e.g., off-road dumped cardboard boxes.\nTo systematically discover such vulnerabilities, we design PlanFuzz, a novel\ndynamic testing approach that addresses various problem-specific design\nchallenges. Specifically, we propose and identify planning invariants as novel\ntesting oracles, and design new input generation to systematically enforce\nproblemspecific constraints for attacker-introduced physical objects. We also\ndesign a novel behavioral planning vulnerability distance metric to effectively\nguide the discovery. We evaluate PlanFuzz on 3 planning implementations from\npractical open-source AD systems, and find that it can effectively discover 9\npreviouslyunknown semantic DoS vulnerabilities without false positives.

    "title": "Agent-Temporal Attention for Reward Redistribution in Episodic  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "This paper considers multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks where\nagents receive a shared global reward at the end of an episode. The delayed\nnature of this reward affects the ability of the agents to assess the quality\nof their actions at intermediate time-steps. This paper focuses on developing\nmethods to learn a temporal redistribution of the episodic reward to obtain a\ndense reward signal. Solving such MARL problems requires addressing two\nchallenges: identifying (1) relative importance of states along the length of\nan episode (along time), and (2) relative importance of individual agents'\nstates at any single time-step (among agents). In this paper, we introduce\nAgent-Temporal Attention for Reward Redistribution in Episodic Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (AREL) to address these two challenges. AREL uses\nattention mechanisms to characterize the influence of actions on state\ntransitions along trajectories (temporal attention), and how each agent is\naffected by other agents at each time-step (agent attention). The redistributed\nrewards predicted by AREL are dense, and can be integrated with any given MARL\nalgorithm. We evaluate AREL on challenging tasks from the Particle World\nenvironment and the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge. AREL results in higher\nrewards in Particle World, and improved win rates in StarCraft compared to\nthree state-of-the-art reward redistribution methods.

    "title": "SIMD Lossy Compression for Scientific Data",
    "abstract": "Modern HPC applications produce increasingly large amounts of data, which\nlimits the performance of current extreme-scale systems. Data reduction\ntechniques, such as lossy compression, help to mitigate this issue by\ndecreasing the size of data generated by these applications. SZ, a current\nstate-of-the-art lossy compressor, is able to achieve high compression ratios,\nbut the prediction/quantization methods used introduce dependencies which\nprevent parallelizing this step of the compression. Recent work proposes a\nparallel dual prediction/quantization algorithm for GPUs which removes these\ndependencies. However, some HPC systems and applications do not use GPUs, and\ncould still benefit from the fine-grained parallelism of this method. Using the\ndual-quantization technique, we implement and optimize a SIMD vectorized CPU\nversion of SZ, and create a heuristic for selecting the optimal block size and\nvector length. We also investigate the effect of non-zero block padding values\nto decrease the number of unpredictable values along compression block borders.\nWe measure performance of vecSZ against an O3 optimized CPU version of SZ using\ndual-quantization, pSZ, as well as SZ-1.4. We evaluate our vectorized version,\nvecSZ, on the Intel Skylake and AMD Rome architectures using real-world\nscientific datasets. We find that applying alternative padding reduces the\nnumber of outliers by 100\\% for some configurations. Our implementation also\nresults in up to 32\\% improvement in rate-distortion and up to 15$\\times$\nspeedup over SZ-1.4, achieving a prediction and quantization bandwidth in\nexcess of 3.4 GB/s.",

Biased CSPs are versatile and express several well\nstudied problems such as Densest-$k$-Sub(Hyper)graph and SmallSetExpansion.\nIn this work, we explore the role played by the bias parameter $\\mu$ on the\napproximability of biased CSPs. We show that the approximability of such CSPs\ncan be characterized (up to loss of factors of arity $r$) using the\nbias-approximation curve of Densest-$k$-SubHypergraph (DkSH). In particular,\nthis gives a tight characterization of predicates which admit approximation\nguarantees that are independent of the bias parameter $\\mu$.\nMotivated by the above, we give new approximation and hardness results for\nDkSH. In particular, assuming the Small Set Expansion Hypothesis (SSEH), we\nshow that DkSH with arity $r$ and $k = \\mu n$ is NP-hard to approximate to a\nfactor of $\\Omega(r^3\\mu^{r-1}\\log(1/\\mu))$ for every $r \\geq 2$ and $\\mu <\n2^{-r}$. We also give a $O(\\mu^{r-1}\\log(1/\\mu))$-approximation algorithm for\nthe same setting. Our upper and lower bounds are tight up to constant factors,\nwhen the arity $r$ is a constant, and in particular, imply the first tight\napproximation bounds for the Densest-$k$-Subgraph problem in the linear bias\nregime. Furthermore, using the above characterization, our results also imply\nmatching algorithms and hardness for every biased CSP of constant arity.",

To create VEOs, we built a multi-view capture system that\ncaptures objects under the influence of a compressed air stream.

The challenge is composed of three tasks related to\nthe automatic analysis of PET/CT images for patients with Head and Neck cancer\n(H&N), focusing on the oropharynx region. Task 1 is the automatic segmentation\nof H&N primary Gross Tumor Volume (GTVt) in FDG-PET/CT images. Task 2 is the\nautomatic prediction of Progression Free Survival (PFS) from the same\nFDG-PET/CT. Finally, Task 3 is the same as Task 2 with ground truth GTVt\nannotations provided to the participants. The data were collected from six\ncenters for a total of 325 images, split into 224 training and 101 testing\ncases. The interest in the challenge was highlighted by the important\nparticipation with 103 registered teams and 448 result submissions. The best\nmethods obtained a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.7591 in the first\ntask, and a Concordance index (C-index) of 0.7196 and 0.6978 in Tasks 2 and 3,\nrespectively. In all tasks, simplicity of the approach was found to be key to\nensure generalization performance. The comparison of the PFS prediction\nperformance in Tasks 2 and 3 suggests that providing the GTVt contour was not\ncrucial to achieve best results, which indicates that fully automatic methods\ncan be used.

In contrast,\nwhen AI is focused on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, then humans\nretain the power to insist on a share of the value created. Furthermore,\naugmentation creates new capabilities and new products and services, ultimately\ngenerating far more value than merely human-like AI.

    "abstract": "As a hybrid imaging technology, photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) imaging\nsuffers from noise due to the maximum permissible exposure of laser intensity,\nattenuation of ultrasound in the tissue, and the inherent noise of the\ntransducer. De-noising is a post-processing method to reduce noise, and PAM\nimage quality can be recovered. However, previous de-noising techniques usually\nheavily rely on mathematical priors as well as manually selected parameters,\nresulting in unsatisfactory and slow de-noising performance for different noisy\nimages, which greatly hinders practical and clinical applications. In this\nwork, we propose a deep learning-based method to remove complex noise from PAM\nimages without mathematical priors and manual selection of settings for\ndifferent input images. An attention enhanced generative adversarial network is\nused to extract image features and remove various noises. The proposed method\nis demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets, including phantom (leaf\nveins) and in vivo (mouse ear blood vessels and zebrafish pigment) experiments.\nThe results show that compared with previous PAM de-noising methods, our method\nexhibits good performance in recovering images qualitatively and\nquantitatively.

    "abstract": "Given $n$ i.i.d. samples drawn from an unknown distribution $P$, when is it\npossible to produce a larger set of $n+m$ samples which cannot be distinguished\nfrom $n+m$ i.i.d. samples drawn from $P$? (Axelrod et al. 2019) formalized this\nquestion as the sample amplification problem, and gave optimal amplification\nprocedures for discrete distributions and Gaussian location models. However,\nthese procedures and associated lower bounds are tailored to the specific\ndistribution classes, and a general statistical understanding of sample\namplification is still largely missing. In this work, we place the sample\namplification problem on a firm statistical foundation by deriving generally\napplicable amplification procedures, lower bound techniques and connections to\nexisting statistical notions. Our techniques apply to a large class of\ndistributions including the exponential family, and establish a rigorous\nconnection between sample amplification and distribution learning.",

    "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common osteoarthritis and a leading\ncause of disability. Cartilage defects are regarded as major manifestations of\nknee OA, which are visible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thus early\ndetection and assessment for knee cartilage defects are important for\nprotecting patients from knee OA. In this way, many attempts have been made on\nknee cartilage defect assessment by applying convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) to knee MRI. However, the physiologic characteristics of the cartilage\nmay hinder such efforts: the cartilage is a thin curved layer, implying that\nonly a small portion of voxels in knee MRI can contribute to the cartilage\ndefect assessment; heterogeneous scanning protocols further challenge the\nfeasibility of the CNNs in clinical practice; the CNN-based knee cartilage\nevaluation results lack interpretability. To address these challenges, we model\nthe cartilages structure and appearance from knee MRI into a graph\nrepresentation, which is capable of handling highly diverse clinical data.\nThen, guided by the cartilage graph representation, we design a non-Euclidean\ndeep learning network with the self-attention mechanism, to extract cartilage\nfeatures in the local and global, and to derive the final assessment with a\nvisualized result. Our comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method\nyields superior performance in knee cartilage defect assessment, plus its\nconvenient 3D visualization for interpretability.",

    "abstract": "This work systematically investigates the adversarial robustness of deep\nimage denoisers (DIDs), i.e, how well DIDs can recover the ground truth from\nnoisy observations degraded by adversarial perturbations. Firstly, to evaluate\nDIDs' robustness, we propose a novel adversarial attack, namely\nObservation-based Zero-mean Attack ({\\sc ObsAtk}), to craft adversarial\nzero-mean perturbations on given noisy images. We find that existing DIDs are\nvulnerable to the adversarial noise generated by {\\sc ObsAtk}. Secondly, to\nrobustify DIDs, we propose an adversarial training strategy, hybrid adversarial\ntraining ({\\sc HAT}), that jointly trains DIDs with adversarial and\nnon-adversarial noisy data to ensure that the reconstruction quality is high\nand the denoisers around non-adversarial data are locally smooth. The resultant\nDIDs can effectively remove various types of synthetic and adversarial noise.\nWe also uncover that the robustness of DIDs benefits their generalization\ncapability on unseen real-world noise. Indeed, {\\sc HAT}-trained DIDs can\nrecover high-quality clean images from real-world noise even without training\non real noisy data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including\nSet68, PolyU, and SIDD, corroborate the effectiveness of {\\sc ObsAtk} and {\\sc\nHAT}.",

It is estimated that\nannually over 13,000 deaths occur in the US due to GBM, making it crucial to\nhave early diagnosis systems that can lead to predictable and effective\ntreatment. The most common treatment after GBM diagnosis is chemotherapy, which\nworks by sending rapidly dividing cells to apoptosis. However, this form of\ntreatment is not effective when the MGMT promoter sequence is methylated, and\ninstead leads to severe side effects decreasing patient survivability.\nTherefore, it is important to be able to identify the MGMT promoter methylation\nstatus through non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based machine\nlearning (ML) models. This is accomplished using the Brain Tumor Segmentation\n(BraTS) 2021 dataset, which was recently used for an international Kaggle\ncompetition.

The tightest lower bound on the\ncomplexity and an algorithm whose performance guarantee matches the lower bound\nhave long been open problems when the variances are unknown and when the\nalgorithm is agnostic to the optimal proportion of the arm draws. In this\npaper, we propose a strategy comprising a sampling rule with randomized\nsampling (RS) following the estimated target allocation probabilities of arm\ndraws and a recommendation rule using the augmented inverse probability\nweighting (AIPW) estimator, which is often used in the causal inference\nliterature.

That modern deep neural\nnetworks generalize well despite a large number of parameters contradicts this\nfinding and constitutes a major unsolved problem towards explaining the success\nof deep learning. The implicit regularization induced by stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) has been regarded to be important, but its specific principle is\nstill unknown. In this work, we study how the local geometry of the energy\nlandscape around local minima affects the statistical properties of SGD with\nGaussian gradient noise. We argue that under reasonable assumptions, the local\ngeometry forces SGD to stay close to a low dimensional subspace and that this\ninduces implicit regularization and results in tighter bounds on the\ngeneralization error for deep neural networks. To derive generalization error\nbounds for neural networks, we first introduce a notion of stagnation sets\naround the local minima and impose a local essential convexity property of the\npopulation risk. Under these conditions, lower bounds for SGD to remain in\nthese stagnation sets are derived. If stagnation occurs, we derive a bound on\nthe generalization error of deep neural networks involving the spectral norms\nof the weight matrices but not the number of network parameters.

    "title": "GraphVAMPNet, using graph neural networks and variational approach to  markov processes for dynamical modeling of biomolecules",
    "abstract": "Finding low dimensional representation of data from long-timescale\ntrajectories of biomolecular processes such as protein-folding or\nligand-receptor binding is of fundamental importance and kinetic models such as\nMarkov modeling have proven useful in describing the kinetics of these systems.\nRecently, an unsupervised machine learning technique called VAMPNet was\nintroduced to learn the low dimensional representation and linear dynamical\nmodel in an end-to-end manner. VAMPNet is based on variational approach to\nMarkov processes (VAMP) and relies on neural networks to learn the\ncoarse-grained dynamics. In this contribution, we combine VAMPNet and graph\nneural networks to generate an end-to-end framework to efficiently learn\nhigh-level dynamics and metastable states from the long-timescale molecular\ndynamics trajectories. This method bears the advantages of graph representation\nlearning and uses graph message passing operations to generate an embedding for\neach datapoint which is used in the VAMPNet to generate a coarse-grained\nrepresentation. This type of molecular representation results in a higher\nresolution and more interpretable Markov model than the standard VAMPNet\nenabling a more detailed kinetic study of the biomolecular processes. Our\nGraphVAMPNet approach is also enhanced with an attention mechanism to find the\nimportant residues for classification into different metastable states.",
