    "abstract": "Modern online services continuously generate data at very fast rates. This\ncontinuous flow of data encompasses content -- e.g., posts, news, products,\ncomments --, but also user feedback -- e.g., ratings, views, reads, clicks --,\ntogether with context data -- user device, spatial or temporal data, user task\nor activity, weather. This can be overwhelming for systems and algorithms\ndesigned to train in batches, given the continuous and potentially fast change\nof content, context and user preferences or intents. Therefore, it is important\nto investigate online methods able to transparently adapt to the inherent\ndynamics of online services. Incremental models that learn from data streams\nare gaining attention in the recommender systems community, given their natural\nability to deal with the continuous flows of data generated in dynamic, complex\nenvironments. User modeling and personalization can particularly benefit from\nalgorithms capable of maintaining models incrementally and online.\nThe objective of this workshop is to foster contributions and bring together\na growing community of researchers and practitioners interested in online,\nadaptive approaches to user modeling, recommendation and personalization, and\ntheir implications regarding multiple dimensions, such as evaluation,\nreproducibility, privacy and explainability.",

    "abstract": "Structured capability access (\"SCA\") is an emerging paradigm for the safe\ndeployment of artificial intelligence (AI). Instead of openly disseminating AI\nsystems, developers facilitate controlled, arm's length interactions with their\nAI systems. The aim is to prevent dangerous AI capabilities from being widely\naccessible, whilst preserving access to AI capabilities that can be used\nsafely. The developer must both restrict how the AI system can be used, and\nprevent the user from circumventing these restrictions through modification or\nreverse engineering of the AI system. SCA is most effective when implemented\nthrough cloud-based AI services, rather than disseminating AI software that\nruns locally on users' hardware. Cloud-based interfaces provide the AI\ndeveloper greater scope for controlling how the AI system is used, and for\nprotecting against unauthorized modifications to the system's design. This\nchapter expands the discussion of \"publication norms\" in the AI community,\nwhich to date has focused on the question of how the informational content of\nAI research projects should be disseminated (e.g., code and models). Although\nthis is an important question, there are limits to what can be achieved through\nthe control of information flows. SCA views AI software not only as information\nthat can be shared but also as a tool with which users can have arm's length\ninteractions. There are early examples of SCA being practiced by AI developers,\nbut there is much room for further development, both in the functionality of\ncloud-based interfaces and in the wider institutional framework.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) offers a decentralized learning environment so that a\ngroup of clients can collaborate to train a global model at the server, while\nkeeping their training data confidential. This paper studies how to launch\nover-the-air jamming attacks to disrupt the FL process when it is executed over\na wireless network. As a wireless example, FL is applied to learn how to\nclassify wireless signals collected by clients (spectrum sensors) at different\nlocations (such as in cooperative sensing). An adversary can jam the\ntransmissions for the local model updates from clients to the server (uplink\nattack), or the transmissions for the global model updates the server to\nclients (downlink attack), or both. Given a budget imposed on the number of\nclients that can be attacked per FL round, clients for the (uplink/downlink)\nattack are selected according to their local model accuracies that would be\nexpected without an attack or ranked via spectrum observations. This novel\nattack is extended to general settings by accounting different processing\nspeeds and attack success probabilities for clients. Compared to benchmark\nattack schemes, this attack approach degrades the FL performance significantly,\nthereby revealing new vulnerabilities of FL to jamming attacks in wireless\nnetworks.",

    "abstract": "Rationales, snippets of extracted text that explain an inference, have\nemerged as a popular framework for interpretable natural language processing\n(NLP). Rationale models typically consist of two cooperating modules: a\nselector and a classifier with the goal of maximizing the mutual information\n(MMI) between the \"selected\" text and the document label. Despite their\npromises, MMI-based methods often pick up on spurious text patterns and result\nin models with nonsensical behaviors. In this work, we investigate whether\ncounterfactual data augmentation (CDA), without human assistance, can improve\nthe performance of the selector by lowering the mutual information between\nspurious signals and the document label. Our counterfactuals are produced in an\nunsupervised fashion using class-dependent generative models. From an\ninformation theoretic lens, we derive properties of the unaugmented dataset for\nwhich our CDA approach would succeed. The effectiveness of CDA is empirically\nevaluated by comparing against several baselines including an improved\nMMI-based rationale schema on two multi aspect datasets. Our results show that\nCDA produces rationales that better capture the signal of interest.",

    "title": "CurvingLoRa to Boost LoRa Network Capacity via Concurrent Transmission",
    "abstract": "LoRaWAN has emerged as an appealing technology to connect IoT devices but it\nfunctions without explicit coordination among transmitters, which can lead to\nmany packet collisions as the network scales. State-of-the-art work proposes\nvarious approaches to deal with these collisions, but most functions only in\nhigh signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) conditions and thus does not scale to\nmany scenarios where weak receptions are easily buried by stronger receptions\nfrom nearby transmitters. In this paper, we take a fresh look at LoRa's\nphysical layer, revealing that its underlying linear chirp modulation\nfundamentally limits the capacity and scalability of concurrentLoRa\ntransmissions. We show that by replacing linear chirps with their non-linear\ncounterparts, we can boost the capacity of concurrent LoRa transmissions and\nempower the LoRa receiver to successfully receive weak transmissions in the\npresence of strong colliding signals. Such a non-linear chirp design further\nenables the receiver to demodulate fully aligned collision symbols - a case\nwhere none of the existing approaches can deal with. We implement these ideas\nin a holistic LoRaWAN stack based on the USRP N210 software-defined radio\nplatform. Our head-to-head comparison with two state-of-the-art research\nsystems and a standard LoRaWAN baseline demonstrates that CurvingLoRa improves\nthe network throughput by 1.6-7.6x while simultaneously sacrificing neither\npower efficiency nor noise resilience.

    "abstract": "Emerging applications such as Augmented Reality, the Internet of Vehicles and\nRemote Surgery require both computing and networking functions working in\nharmony. The End-to-end (E2E) quality of experience (QoE) for these\napplications depends on the synchronous allocation of networking and computing\nresources. However, the relationship between the resources and the E2E QoE\noutcomes is typically stochastic and non-linear. In order to make efficient\nresource allocation decisions, it is essential to model these relationships.\nThis article presents a novel machine-learning based approach to learn these\nrelationships and concurrently orchestrate both resources for this purpose. The\nmachine learning models further help make robust allocation decisions regarding\nstochastic variations and simplify robust optimization to a conventional\nconstrained optimization. When resources are insufficient to accommodate all\napplication requirements, our framework supports executing some of the\napplications with minimal degradation (graceful degradation) of E2E QoE. We\nalso show how we can implement the learning and optimization methods in a\ndistributed fashion by the Software-Defined Network (SDN) and Kubernetes\ntechnologies. Our results show that deep learning-based modelling achieves E2E\nQoE with approximately 99.8\\% accuracy, and our robust joint-optimization\ntechnique allocates resources efficiently when compared to existing\ndifferential services alternatives.",

Existing solutions to isolate microcontroller (MCU) resources in\norder to increase their security face significant challenges such as specific\nhardware unavailability, Memory Protection Unit (MPU) limitations and a\nsignificant lack of Direct Memory Access (DMA) support. Nevertheless, DMA is\nfundamental for the power and performance requirements of embedded\napplications. In this paper, we present D-Box, a systematic approach to enable\nsecure DMA operations for compartmentalization solutions of embedded\napplications using real-time operating systems (RTOS). D-Box defines a\nreference architecture and a workflow to protect DMA operations holistically.\nIt provides practical methods to harden the kernel and define capability-based\nsecurity policies for easy definition of DMA operations with strong security\nproperties. We implemented a D-Box prototype for the Cortex-M3/M4 on top of the\npopular FreeRTOS-MPU (F-MPU). The D-Box procedures and a stricter security\nmodel enabled DMA operations, yet it exposed 41 times less ROP\n(return-orienting-programming) gadgets when compared with the standard F-MPU.\nD-Box adds only a 2% processor overhead while reducing the power consumption of\nperipheral operation benchmarks by 18.2%.

    "abstract": "Variational autoencoders are among the most popular methods for distilling\nlow-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data, making them increasingly\nvaluable as tools for data exploration and scientific discovery. However,\nunlike typical machine learning problems in which a single model is trained\nonce on a single large dataset, scientific workflows privilege learned features\nthat are reproducible, portable across labs, and capable of incrementally\nadding new data. Ideally, methods used by different research groups should\nproduce comparable results, even without sharing fully trained models or entire\ndata sets. Here, we address this challenge by introducing the Rosetta VAE\n(R-VAE), a method of distilling previously learned representations and\nretraining new models to reproduce and build on prior results. The R-VAE uses\npost hoc clustering over the latent space of a fully-trained model to identify\na small number of Rosetta Points (input, latent pairs) to serve as anchors for\ntraining future models. An adjustable hyperparameter, $\\rho$, balances fidelity\nto the previously learned latent space against accommodation of new data. We\ndemonstrate that the R-VAE reconstructs data as well as the VAE and\n$\\beta$-VAE, outperforms both methods in recovery of a target latent space in a\nsequential training setting, and dramatically increases consistency of the\nlearned representation across training runs.",

We hope to remedy this\nissue by accumulating and expounding upon the thoughts and discussions of fair\nmachine learning produced by both social and formal (specifically machine\nlearning and statistics) sciences in this field guide. Specifically, in\naddition to giving the mathematical and algorithmic backgrounds of several\npopular statistical and causal-based fair machine learning methods, we explain\nthe underlying philosophical and legal thoughts that support them. Further, we\nexplore several criticisms of the current approaches to fair machine learning\nfrom sociological and philosophical viewpoints. It is our hope that this field\nguide will help fair machine learning practitioners better understand how their\nalgorithms align with important humanistic values (such as fairness) and how we\ncan, as a field, design methods and metrics to better serve oppressed and\nmarginalized populaces.",

    "abstract": "Given polynomials $f_0,\\dots, f_k$ the Ideal Membership Problem, IMP for\nshort, asks if $f_0$ belongs to the ideal generated by $f_1,\\dots, f_k$. In the\nsearch version of this problem the task is to find a proof of this fact. The\nIMP is a well-known fundamental problem with numerous applications, for\ninstance, it underlies many proof systems based on polynomials such as\nNullstellensatz, Polynomial Calculus, and Sum-of-Squares. Although the IMP is\nin general intractable, in many important cases it can be efficiently solved.\nMastrolilli [SODA'19] initiated a systematic study of IMPs for ideals arising\nfrom Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), parameterized by constraint\nlanguages, denoted IMP($\\Gamma$). The ultimate goal of this line of research is\nto classify all such IMPs accordingly to their complexity. Mastrolilli achieved\nthis goal for IMPs arising from CSP($\\Gamma$) where $\\Gamma$ is a Boolean\nconstraint language, while Bulatov and Rafiey [ArXiv'21] advanced these results\nto several cases of CSPs over finite domains. In this paper we consider IMPs\narising from CSPs over `affine' constraint languages, in which constraints are\nsubgroups (or their cosets) of direct products of Abelian groups. This kind of\nCSPs include systems of linear equations and are considered one of the most\nimportant types of tractable CSPs. Some special cases of the problem have been\nconsidered before by Bharathi and Mastrolilli [MFCS'21] for linear equation\nmodulo 2, and by Bulatov and Rafiey [ArXiv'21] to systems of linear equations\nover $GF(p)$, $p$ prime. Here we prove that if $\\Gamma$ is an affine constraint\nlanguage then IMP($\\Gamma$) is solvable in polynomial time assuming the input\npolynomial has bounded degree.",

    "abstract": "Wireless links using massive MIMO transceivers are vital for next generation\nwireless communications networks networks. Precoding in Massive MIMO\ntransmission requires accurate downlink channel state information (CSI). Many\nrecent works have effectively applied deep learning (DL) to jointly train\nUE-side compression networks for delay domain CSI and a BS-side decoding\nscheme. Vitally, these works assume that the full delay domain CSI is available\nat the UE, but in reality, the UE must estimate the delay domain based on a\nlimited number of frequency domain pilots. In this work, we propose a linear\npilot-to-delay (P2D) estimator that transforms sparse frequency pilots to the\ntruncated delay CSI. We show that the P2D estimator is accurate under frequency\ndownsampling, and we demonstrate that the P2D estimate can be effectively\nutilized with existing autoencoder-based CSI estimation networks. In addition\nto accounting for pilot-based estimates of downlink CSI, we apply unrolled\noptimization networks to emulate iterative solutions to compressed sensing\n(CS), and we demonstrate better estimation performance than prior\nautoencoder-based DL networks. Finally, we investigate the efficacy of\ntrainable CS networks for in a differential encoding network for time-varying\nCSI estimation, and we propose a new network, MarkovNet-ISTA-ENet, comprised of\nboth a CS network for initial CSI estimation and multiple autoencoders to\nestimate the error terms.

    "abstract": "Machine learning is increasingly used in the most diverse applications and\ndomains, whether in healthcare, to predict pathologies, or in the financial\nsector to detect fraud. One of the linchpins for efficiency and accuracy in\nmachine learning is data utility. However, when it contains personal\ninformation, full access may be restricted due to laws and regulations aiming\nto protect individuals' privacy. Therefore, data owners must ensure that any\ndata shared guarantees such privacy. Removal or transformation of private\ninformation (de-identification) are among the most common techniques.\nIntuitively, one can anticipate that reducing detail or distorting information\nwould result in losses for model predictive performance. However, previous work\nconcerning classification tasks using de-identified data generally demonstrates\nthat predictive performance can be preserved in specific applications. In this\npaper, we aim to evaluate the existence of a trade-off between data privacy and\npredictive performance in classification tasks. We leverage a large set of\nprivacy-preserving techniques and learning algorithms to provide an assessment\nof re-identification ability and the impact of transformed variants on\npredictive performance.

    "abstract": "Motivated by scenarios of information diffusion and advertising in social\nmedia, we study an influence maximization problem in which little is assumed to\nbe known about the diffusion network or about the model that determines how\ninformation may propagate. In such a highly uncertain environment, one can\nfocus on multi-round diffusion campaigns, with the objective to maximize the\nnumber of distinct users that are influenced or activated, starting from a\nknown base of few influential nodes. During a campaign, spread seeds are\nselected sequentially at consecutive rounds, and feedback is collected in the\nform of the activated nodes at each round. A round's impact (reward) is then\nquantified as the number of newly activated nodes. Overall, one must maximize\nthe campaign's total spread, as the sum of rounds' rewards. In this setting, an\nexplore-exploit approach could be used to learn the key underlying diffusion\nparameters, while running the campaign. We describe and compare two methods of\ncontextual multi-armed bandits, with upper-confidence bounds on the remaining\npotential of influencers, one using a generalized linear model and the\nGood-Turing estimator for remaining potential (GLM-GT-UCB), and another one\nthat directly adapts the LinUCB algorithm to our setting (LogNorm-LinUCB).

    "abstract": "Domain-specific SoCs (DSSoCs) are attractive solutions for domains with\nstringent power/performance/area constraints; however, they suffer from two\nfundamental complexities. On the one hand, their many specialized hardware\nblocks result in complex systems and thus high development effort. On the\nother, their many system knobs expand the complexity of design space, making\nthe search for the optimal design difficult. Thus to reach prevalence, taming\nsuch complexities is necessary. This work identifies necessary features of an\nearly-stage design space exploration (DSE) framework that targets the complex\ndesign space of DSSoCs and further provides an instance of one called FARSI,\n(F)acebook (AR) (S)ystem (I)nvestigator. Concretely, FARSI provides an agile\nsystem-level simulator with speed up and accuracy of 8,400X and 98.5% comparing\nto Synopsys Platform Architect. FARSI also provides an efficient exploration\nheuristic and achieves up to 16X improvementin convergence time comparing to\nnaive simulated annealing (SA). This is done by augmenting SA with\narchitectural reasoning such as locality exploitation and bottleneck\nrelaxation. Furthermore, we embed various co-design capabilities and show that\non average, they have a 32% impact on the convergence rate. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that using simple development-cost-aware policies can lower the\nsystem complexity, both in terms of the component count and variation by as\nmuch as 150% and 118% (e,g., for Network-on-a-Chip subsystem)",

Additionally, we reformulate this task as a ranking problem and\npropose new deep learning models to solve it. The models are based on a\nbidirectional recurrent neural network with attention and on a convolutional\nneural network, with the weights of the models optimized using a ranking loss\nfunction. To improve the quality of ranking, we propose using additional\ninformation from version control system annotations. Two approaches are\nproposed for extracting features from annotations: manual and using an\nadditional neural network. To evaluate our models, we collected two datasets of\nreal-world stack traces. Our experiments show that the proposed models\noutperform existing models adapted to handle stack traces. To facilitate\nfurther research in this area, we publish the source code of our models and one\nof the collected datasets.",

    "title": "Adaptive Transfer Learning for Plant Phenotyping",
    "abstract": "Plant phenotyping (Guo et al. 2021; Pieruschka et al. 2019) focuses on\nstudying the diverse traits of plants related to the plants' growth. To be more\nspecific, by accurately measuring the plant's anatomical, ontogenetical,\nphysiological and biochemical properties, it allows identifying the crucial\nfactors of plants' growth in different environments. One commonly used approach\nis to predict the plant's traits using hyperspectral reflectance (Yendrek et\nal. 2017; Wang et al. 2021). However, the data distributions of the\nhyperspectral reflectance data in plant phenotyping might vary in different\nenvironments for different plants. That is, it would be computationally\nexpansive to learn the machine learning models separately for one plant in\ndifferent environments. To solve this problem, we focus on studying the\nknowledge transferability of modern machine learning models in plant\nphenotyping. More specifically, this work aims to answer the following\nquestions. (1) How is the performance of conventional machine learning models,\ne.g., partial least squares regression (PLSR), Gaussian process regression\n(GPR) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), affected by the number of annotated\nsamples for plant phenotyping? (2) Whether could the neural network based\ntransfer learning models improve the performance of plant phenotyping? (3)\nCould the neural network based transfer learning be improved by using\ninfinite-width hidden layers for plant phenotyping?",

    "abstract": "Optimal Volt/VAR control (VVC) in distribution networks relies on an\neffective coordination between the conventional utility-owned mechanical\ndevices and the smart residential photovoltaic (PV) inverters. Typically, a\ncentral controller carries out a periodic optimization and sends setpoints to\nthe local controller of each device. However, instead of tracking centrally\ndispatched setpoints, smart PV inverters can cooperate on a much faster\ntimescale to reach optimality within a PV inverter group. To accommodate such\nPV inverter groups in the VVC architecture, this paper proposes a bi-level\noptimization framework. The upper-level determines the setpoints of the\nmechanical devices to minimize the network active power losses, while the\nlower-level represents the coordinated actions that the inverters take for\ntheir own objectives. The interactions between these two levels are captured in\nthe bi-level optimization, which is solved using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)\nconditions. This framework fully exploits the capabilities of the different\ntypes of voltage regulation devices and enables them to cooperatively optimize\ntheir goals. Case studies on typical distribution networks with field-recorded\ndata demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.",

In this paper, we consider\nthe problem of designing shared backup path protection (SBPP) based EON that\nfacilitates the minimum quality-of-transmission (QoT) assured allocation\nagainst physical layer impairments (PLIs) under any single link/shared risk\nlink group (SRLG) failure for static and dynamic traffic scenarios. In general,\nthe effect of PLIs on lightpath varies based on the location of failure of a\nlink as it introduces different active working and backup paths. To address\nthese issues in the design of SBPP EON, we formulate a mixed integer linear\nprogramming (MILP) based robust optimization framework for static traffic with\nthe objective of minimizing overall fragmentation. In this process, we use the\nefficient bitloading technique for spectrum allocation for the first time in\nsurvivable EONs. In addition, we propose a novel SBPP-impairment aware\n(SBPP-IA) algorithm considering the limitations of MILP for larger networks.\nFor this purpose, we introduce a novel sorting technique named most congested\nworking-least congested backup first (MCW-LCBF) to sort the given set of static\nrequests. Next, we employ our SBPP-IA algorithm for dynamic traffic scenario\nand compare it with existing algorithms in terms of different QoT parameters.\nWe demonstrated through simulations that our study provides around 40% more QoT\nguaranteed requests compared to existing ones.",

Inspired from this, we tackle video scene\nsegmentation, which is a task of temporally localizing scene boundaries in a\nvideo, with a self-supervised learning framework where we mainly focus on\ndesigning effective pretext tasks. In our framework, we discover a\npseudo-boundary from a sequence of shots by splitting it into two continuous,\nnon-overlapping sub-sequences and leverage the pseudo-boundary to facilitate\nthe pre-training. Based on this, we introduce three novel boundary-aware\npretext tasks: 1) Shot-Scene Matching (SSM), 2) Contextual Group Matching (CGM)\nand 3) Pseudo-boundary Prediction (PP); SSM and CGM guide the model to maximize\nintra-scene similarity and inter-scene discrimination while PP encourages the\nmodel to identify transitional moments.

    "abstract": "Outside-knowledge visual question answering (OK-VQA) requires the agent to\ncomprehend the image, make use of relevant knowledge from the entire web, and\ndigest all the information to answer the question. Most previous works address\nthe problem by first fusing the image and question in the multi-modal space,\nwhich is inflexible for further fusion with a vast amount of external\nknowledge. In this paper, we call for a paradigm shift for the OK-VQA task,\nwhich transforms the image into plain text, so that we can enable knowledge\npassage retrieval, and generative question-answering in the natural language\nspace. This paradigm takes advantage of the sheer volume of gigantic knowledge\nbases and the richness of pre-trained language models. A\nTransform-Retrieve-Generate framework (TRiG) framework is proposed, which can\nbe plug-and-played with alternative image-to-text models and textual knowledge\nbases. Experimental results show that our TRiG framework outperforms all\nstate-of-the-art supervised methods by at least 11.1% absolute margin.",

Though respectable works have made decent\nachievements in this task, they severely rely on abundant video-query paired\ndata, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect in real-world scenarios.\nIn this paper, we explore whether a video grounding model can be learned\nwithout any paired annotations.

Specifically, we\nfirst develop a language semantic mining module, which extracts implicit\nsemantic features from the whole query set. Then, these language semantic\nfeatures serve as the guidance to compose the activity in video via a\nvideo-based semantic aggregation module. Finally, we utilize a foreground\nattention branch to filter out the redundant background activities and refine\nthe grounding results. To validate the effectiveness of our DSCNet, we conduct\nexperiments on both ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA datasets.

    "title": "A Novel Skeleton-Based Human Activity Discovery Technique Using Particle  Swarm Optimization with Gaussian Mutation",
    "abstract": "Human activity discovery aims to distinguish the activities performed by\nhumans, without any prior information of what defines each activity. Most\nmethods presented in human activity recognition are supervised, where there are\nlabeled inputs to train the system. In reality, it is difficult to label data\nbecause of its huge volume and the variety of activities performed by humans.\nIn this paper, a novel unsupervised approach is proposed to perform human\nactivity discovery in 3D skeleton sequences. First, important frames are\nselected based on kinetic energy. Next, the displacement of joints, set of\nstatistical, angles, and orientation features are extracted to represent the\nactivities information. Since not all extracted features have useful\ninformation, the dimension of features is reduced using PCA. Most human\nactivity discovery proposed are not fully unsupervised. They use pre-segmented\nvideos before categorizing activities. To deal with this, we used the\nfragmented sliding time window method to segment the time series of activities\nwith some overlapping. Then, activities are discovered by a novel hybrid\nparticle swarm optimization with a Gaussian mutation algorithm to avoid getting\nstuck in the local optimum. Finally, k-means is applied to the outcome\ncentroids to overcome the slow rate of PSO. Experiments on three datasets have\nbeen presented and the results show the proposed method has superior\nperformance in discovering activities in all evaluation parameters compared to\nthe other state-of-the-art methods and has increased accuracy of at least 4 %\non average.

    "abstract": "In three laboratory experiments, we examine the impact of personally relevant\nfailures (PeRFs) on perceptions of a collaborative robot. PeR is determined by\nhow much a specific issue applies to a particular person, i.e., it affects\none's own goals and values. We hypothesized that PeRFs would reduce trust in\nthe robot and the robot's Likeability and Willingness to Use (LWtU) more than\nfailures that are not personal to participants. To achieve PeR in human-robot\ninteraction, we utilized three different manipulation mechanisms: A) damage to\nproperty, B) financial loss, and C) first-person versus third-person failure\nscenarios. In total, 132 participants engaged with a robot in person during a\ncollaborative task of laundry sorting. All three experiments took place in the\nsame experimental environment, carefully designed to simulate a realistic\nlaundry sorting scenario. Results indicate that the impact of PeRFs on\nperceptions of the robot varied across the studies. In experiments A and B, the\nencounters with PeRFs reduced trust significantly relative to a no failure\nsession. But not entirely for LWtU. In experiment C, the PeR manipulation had\nno impact. The work highlights challenges and adjustments needed for studying\nrobotic failures in laboratory settings. We show that PeR manipulations affect\nhow users perceive a failing robot. The results bring about new questions\nregarding failure types and their perceived severity on users' perception of\nthe robot. Putting PeR aside, we observed differences in the way users perceive\ninteraction failures compared (experiment C) to how they perceive technical\nones (A and B).",

Since the\ncyber landscape is an ever-evolving scenario, one must keep upgrading its\nsecurity systems to enhance the security of the infrastructure. Tools like\nSecurity Information and Event Management (SIEM), Endpoint Detection and\nResponse (EDR), Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), Information Technology\nService Management (ITSM), along with other defensive techniques like Intrusion\nDetection System (IDS), Intrusion Protection System (IPS), and many others\nenhance the cyber security posture of the infrastructure. However, the proposed\nprotection mechanisms have their limitations, they are insufficient to ensure\nsecurity, and the attacker penetrates the network. Deception technology, along\nwith Honeypots, provides a false sense of vulnerability in the target systems\nto the attackers. The attacker deceived reveals threat intel about their modus\noperandi. We have developed a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response\n(SOAR) Engine that dynamically deploys custom honeypots inside the internal\nnetwork infrastructure based on the attacker's behavior. The architecture is\nrobust enough to support multiple VLANs connected to the system and used for\norchestration. The presence of botnet traffic and DDOS attacks on the honeypots\nin the network is detected, along with a malware collection system. After being\nexposed to live traffic for four days, our engine dynamically orchestrated the\nhoneypots 40 times, detected 7823 attacks, 965 DDOS attack packets, and three\nmalicious samples. While our experiments with static honeypots show an average\nattacker engagement time of 102 seconds per instance, our SOAR Engine-based\ndynamic honeypots engage attackers on average 3148 seconds.",

However, most existing\nre-ranking solutions refine recommendation list based on the implicit feedback\nwith a shared re-ranking model, which regrettably ignore the intra-item\nrelationships under diverse user intentions. In this paper, we propose a novel\nIntention-aware Re-ranking Model with Dynamic Transformer Encoder (RAISE),\naiming to perform user-specific prediction for each target user based on her\nintentions. Specifically, we first propose to mine latent user intentions from\ntext reviews with an intention discovering module (IDM). By differentiating the\nimportance of review information with a co-attention network, the latent user\nintention can be explicitly modeled for each user-item pair. We then introduce\na dynamic transformer encoder (DTE) to capture user-specific intra-item\nrelationships among item candidates by seamlessly accommodating the learnt\nlatent user intentions via IDM. As such, RAISE is able to perform user-specific\nprediction without increasing the depth (number of blocks) and width (number of\nheads) of the prediction model.

When common neural style transfer\nmethods are used, the textures and colors in the style image are usually\ntransferred imperfectly to the content image, or some visible errors are\ngenerated. This paper proposes a novel saliency constrained method to reduce or\navoid such effects. It first evaluates some existing saliency detection methods\nto select the most suitable one for use in our method. The selected saliency\ndetection method is used to detect the object in the style image, corresponding\nto the object of the content image with the same saliency. In addition, aim to\nsolve the problem that the size or resolution is different in the style image\nand content, the scale-invariant feature transform is used to generate a series\nof style images and content images which can be used to generate more feature\nmaps for patches matching. It then proposes a new loss function combining the\nsaliency loss, style loss and content loss, adding gradient of saliency\nconstraint into style transfer in iterations. Finally the source images and\nsaliency detection results are utilized as multichannel input to an improved\ndeep CNN framework for style transfer. The experiments show that the saliency\nmaps of source images can help find the correct matching and avoid artifacts.\nExperimental results on different kind of images demonstrate that our method\noutperforms nine representative methods from recent publications and has good\nrobustness.",

    "abstract": "Online participant recruitment platforms such as Prolific have been gaining\npopularity in research, as they enable researchers to easily access large pools\nof participants. However, participant quality can be an issue; participants may\ngive incorrect information to gain access to more studies, adding unwanted\nnoise to results. This paper details our experience recruiting participants\nfrom Prolific for a user study requiring programming skills in Node.js, with\nthe aim of helping other researchers conduct similar studies. We explore a\nmethod of recruiting programmer participants using prescreening validation,\nattention checks and a series of programming knowledge questions. We received\n680 responses, and determined that 55 met the criteria to be invited to our\nuser study. We ultimately conducted user study sessions via video calls with 10\nparticipants. We conclude this paper with a series of recommendations for\nresearchers.",

    "abstract": "We present TFGM (Training Free Graph Matching), a framework to boost the\nperformance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based graph matching without\ntraining. TFGM sidesteps two crucial problems when training GNNs: 1) the\nlimited supervision due to expensive annotation, and 2) training's\ncomputational cost. A basic framework, BasicTFGM, is first proposed by adopting\nthe inference stage of graph matching methods. Our analysis shows that the\nBasicTFGM is a linear relaxation to the quadratic assignment formulation of\ngraph matching. This guarantees the preservation of structure compatibility and\nan efficient polynomial complexity. Empirically, we further improve the\nBasicTFGM by handcrafting two types of matching priors into the architecture of\nGNNs: comparing node neighborhoods of different localities and utilizing\nannotation data if available. For evaluation, we conduct extensive experiments\non a broad set of settings, including supervised keypoint matching between\nimages, semi-supervised entity alignment between knowledge graphs, and\nunsupervised alignment between protein interaction networks. Applying TFGM on\nvarious GNNs shows promising improvements over baselines. Further ablation\nstudies demonstrate the effective and efficient training-free property of TFGM.\nOur code is available at\nhttps://github.com/acharkq/Training-Free-Graph-Matching.",

    "abstract": "Lattice Boltzmann schemes rely on the enlargement of the size of the target\nproblem in order to solve PDEs in a highly parallelizable and efficient\nkinetic-like fashion, split into a collision and a stream phase. This\nstructure, despite the well-known advantages from a computational standpoint,\nis not suitable to construct a rigorous notion of consistency with respect to\nthe target equations and to provide a precise notion of stability. In order to\nalleviate these shortages and introduce a rigorous framework, we demonstrate\nthat any lattice Boltzmann scheme can be rewritten as a corresponding\nmulti-step Finite Difference scheme on the conserved variables. This is\nachieved by devising a suitable formalism based on operators, commutative\nalgebra and polynomials. Therefore, the notion of consistency of the\ncorresponding Finite Difference scheme allows to invoke the Lax-Richtmyer\ntheorem in the case of linear lattice Boltzmann schemes. Moreover, we show that\nthe frequently-used von Neumann-like stability analysis for lattice Boltzmann\nschemes entirely corresponds to the von Neumann stability analysis of their\nFinite Difference counterpart. More generally, the usual tools for the analysis\nof Finite Difference schemes are now readily available to study lattice\nBoltzmann schemes.

    "abstract": "In this contribution, a novel framework for simulating mixed-mode failure in\nrock is presented. Based on a hybrid phase-field model for mixed-mode fracture,\nseparate phase-field variables are introduced for tensile (mode I) and shear\n(mode II) fracture. The resulting three-field problem features separate length\nscale parameters for mode I and mode II cracks. In contrast to the classic\ntwo-field mixed-mode approaches it can thus account for different tensile and\nshear strength of rock. The two phase-field equations are implicitly coupled\nthrough the degradation of the material in the elastic equation, and the three\nfields are solved using a staggered iteration scheme. For its validation, the\nthree-field model is calibrated for two types of rock, Solnhofen Limestone and\nPfraundorfer Dolostone. To this end, double-edge notched Brazilian disk (DNBD)\ntests are performed to determine the mode II fracture toughness. The numerical\nresults demonstrate that the proposed phase-field model is able to reproduce\nthe different crack patterns observed in the DNBD tests. A final example of a\nuniaxial compression test on a rare drill core demonstrates, that the proposed\nmodel is able to capture complex, 3D mixed-mode crack patterns when calibrated\nwith the correct mode I and mode II fracture toughness.",

Nowadays, the leading\nresearch is on robust localization using economic sensors, such as cameras and\nIMUs. The geometric methods based on these sensors are pretty good in normal\nconditions withstable lighting and no dynamic objects. These methods suffer\nfrom significant loss and divergence in such challenging environments. The\nscientists came to use deep neural networks (DNNs) as the savior to mitigate\nthis problem.

However, no general and robust framework for all\nof these scenarios is available.

In this paper\nwe perform a close replication and extension of a seminal work proposing the\nuse of Deep Learning for agile effort estimation (namely Deep-SE), which has\nset the state-of-the-art since. Specifically, we replicate three of the\noriginal research questions aiming at investigating the effectiveness of\nDeep-SE for both within-project and cross-project effort estimation. We\nbenchmark Deep-SE against three baseline techniques (i.e., Random, Mean and\nMedian effort prediction) and a previously proposed method to estimate agile\nsoftware project development effort (dubbed TF/IDF-SE), as done in the original\nstudy. To this end, we use both the data from the original study and a new\nlarger dataset of 31,960 issues, which we mined from 29 open-source projects.\nUsing more data allows us to strengthen our confidence in the results and\nfurther mitigate the threat to the external validity of the study. We also\nextend the original study by investigating two additional research questions.\nOne evaluates the accuracy of Deep-SE when the training set is augmented with\nissues from all other projects available in the repository at the time of\nestimation, and the other examines whether an expensive pre-training step used\nby the original Deep-SE, has any beneficial effect on its accuracy and\nconvergence speed. The results of our replication show that Deep-SE outperforms\nthe Median baseline estimator and TF/IDF-SE in only very few cases with\nstatistical significance (8/42 and 9/32 cases, respectively), thus confounding\nprevious findings on the efficacy of Deep-SE.

Over\nthe years, different variations were proposed to improve the Stern scheme such\nas the Veron scheme (with public key a noisy codeword rather than a syndrome),\nthe AGS scheme which is a 5-pass protocol with cheating probability\nasymptotically equal to 1/2 and more recently the FJR approach which permits to\ndecrease the cheating probability to 1/N but induces a performance overhead.\nOverall the length of the signature depends on a trade-off between: the scheme\nin itself, the possible optimizations and the cost of the implementation. The\nrecent approaches which increase the cost of the implementation opens the door\nto many different type of trade-offs. In this paper we propose three new\nschemes and different trade-offs, which are all interesting in themselves,\nsince depending on potential future optimizations a scheme may eventually\nbecome more efficient than another. All the schemes we propose use a trusted\nhelper: a first scheme permits to get a 1/2 cheating probability, a second\nscheme permits to decrease the cheating probability in 1/N but with a different\napproach than the recent FJR scheme and at last a third scheme propose a\nVeron-like adaptation of the FJR scheme in which the public key is a noisy\ncodeword rather than a syndrome. We provide an extensive comparison table which\nlists various trade-offs between our schemes and previous ones.",

Nowadays, the embedding-based retrieval (EBR) becomes a\npromising solution, where deep learning based document representation and ANN\nsearch techniques are allied to handle this task. However, a major challenge is\nthat the ANN index can be too large to fit into memory, given the considerable\nsize of answer corpus. In this work, we tackle this problem with Bi-Granular\nDocument Representation, where the lightweight sparse embeddings are indexed\nand standby in memory for coarse-grained candidate search, and the heavyweight\ndense embeddings are hosted in disk for fine-grained post verification. For the\nbest of retrieval accuracy, a Progressive Optimization framework is designed.\nThe sparse embeddings are learned ahead for high-quality search of candidates.\nConditioned on the candidate distribution induced by the sparse embeddings, the\ndense embeddings are continuously learned to optimize the discrimination of\nground-truth from the shortlisted candidates. Besides, two techniques: the\ncontrastive quantization and the locality-centric sampling are introduced for\nthe learning of sparse and dense embeddings, which substantially contribute to\ntheir performances. Thanks to the above features, our method effectively\nhandles massive-scale EBR with strong advantages in accuracy: with up to +4.3%\nrecall gain on million-scale corpus, and up to +17.5% recall gain on\nbillion-scale corpus. Besides, Our method is applied to a major sponsored\nsearch platform with substantial gains on revenue (+1.95%), Recall (+1.01%) and\nCTR (+0.49%).",

    "abstract": "Recent advances on prompt-tuning cast few-shot classification tasks as a\nmasked language modeling problem. By wrapping input into a template and using a\nverbalizer which constructs a mapping between label space and label word space,\nprompt-tuning can achieve excellent results in zero-shot and few-shot\nscenarios. However, typical prompt-tuning needs a manually designed verbalizer\nwhich requires domain expertise and human efforts. And the insufficient label\nspace may introduce considerable bias into the results. In this paper, we focus\non eliciting knowledge from pretrained language models and propose a\nprototypical prompt verbalizer for prompt-tuning. Labels are represented by\nprototypical embeddings in the feature space rather than by discrete words. The\ndistances between the embedding at the masked position of input and\nprototypical embeddings are used as classification criterion. For zero-shot\nsettings, knowledge is elicited from pretrained language models by a manually\ndesigned template to form initial prototypical embeddings. For few-shot\nsettings, models are tuned to learn meaningful and interpretable prototypical\nembeddings. Our method optimizes models by contrastive learning. Extensive\nexperimental results on several many-class text classification datasets with\nlow-resource settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared\nwith other verbalizer construction methods.

    "abstract": "Industry 4.0 uses a subset of the IoT, named Industrial IoT (IIoT), to\nachieve connectivity, interoperability, and decentralization. The deployment of\nindustrial networks rarely considers security by design, but this becomes\nimperative in smart manufacturing as connectivity increases. The combination of\nOT and IT infrastructures in Industry 4.0 adds new security threats beyond\nthose of traditional industrial networks. Defence-in-Depth (DiD) strategies\ntackle the complexity of this problem by providing multiple defense layers,\neach of these focusing on a particular set of threats. Additionally, the strict\nrequirements of IIoT networks demand lightweight encryption algorithms.\nNevertheless, these ciphers must provide E2E (End-to-End) security, as data\npasses through intermediate entities or middleboxes before reaching their\ndestination. If compromised, middleboxes could expose vulnerable information to\npotential attackers if it is not encrypted throughout this path. This paper\npresents an analysis of the most relevant security strategies in Industry 4.0,\nfocusing primarily on DiD. With these in mind, it proposes a combination of\nDiD, an encryption algorithm called Attribute-Based-Encryption (ABE), and\nobject security (i.e., OSCORE) to get an E2E security approach. This analysis\nis a critical first step to developing more complex and lightweight security\nframeworks suitable for Industry 4.0.",

This study systematically investigates how\ndevelopers perceive code review conflicts and addresses interpersonal conflicts\nduring code reviews as a theoretical construct. Through the thematic analysis\nof interviews conducted with 22 developers, we confirm that conflicts during\ncode reviews are commonplace, anticipated and seen as normal by developers.\nEven though conflicts do happen and carry a negative impact for the review,\nconflicts-if resolved constructively-can also create value and bring\nimprovement. Moreover, the analysis provided insights on how strongly conflicts\nduring code review and its context (i.e., code, developer, team, organization)\nare intertwined.

In wind instruments, they can appear at low blowing\npressure when complex fingerings are used. Such multiphonics can be modeled by\nthe Impulse Pattern Formulation (IPF). This top-down method regards musical\ninstruments as systems working with impulses originating from a generating\nentity, travel through the instrument, are reflected at various positions, and\nare exponentially damped. Eventually, impulses return to the generating entity\nand retrigger or interact with subsequent impulses. Due to this straightforward\napproach, the IPF can explain fundamental principles of complex dynamic\nsystems. While modeling wind instruments played with blowing pressures at the\nthreshold of tone onset, the IPF captures transitions between regular\nperiodicity at nominal pitch, bifurcations, and noise. This corresponds to\nbehavior found in wind instruments where multiphonics appear at the transition\nbetween noise and regular musical note regimes. Using the IPF, complex\nfingerings correspond to multiple reflection points at open finger holes with\ndifferent reflection strengths. Multiphonics can be modeled if reflection\npoints farther away show higher reflection strength and thus, disrupt periodic\nmotion. The IPF can also synthesize multiphonic sounds by concatenating typical\nwind instrument waveforms at adjacent impulse time points.",

    "abstract": "Service Function Chaining (SFC) is a trending paradigm, which has helped to\nintroduce unseen flexibility in telecom networks. Network service providers, as\nwell as big network infrastructure providers, are competing to offer\npersonalized services for their customers. Hence, added value services require\nthe invocation of various elementary functions called Service Functions (SFs).\nThe SFC concept composes and imposes the order in which SFs are invoked for a\nparticular service. Emerging technologies such as Software Defined Networking\nand Network Function Virtualization support the dynamic creation and management\nof SFC. Even though SFC is an active technical area where several aspects were\nalready standardized and many SFC architecture flavors are currently deployed,\nyet some challenges and open issues are still to be solved. In this paper, we\npresent different research problems related to SFC and investigate several key\nchallenges that should be addressed to realize more reliable SFC operations.",

    "abstract": "Financial time-series forecasting is one of the most challenging domains in\nthe field of time-series analysis. This is mostly due to the highly\nnon-stationary and noisy nature of financial time-series data. With progressive\nefforts of the community to design specialized neural networks incorporating\nprior domain knowledge, many financial analysis and forecasting problems have\nbeen successfully tackled. The temporal attention mechanism is a neural layer\ndesign that recently gained popularity due to its ability to focus on important\ntemporal events. In this paper, we propose a neural layer based on the ideas of\ntemporal attention and multi-head attention to extend the capability of the\nunderlying neural network in focusing simultaneously on multiple temporal\ninstances. The effectiveness of our approach is validated using large-scale\nlimit-order book market data to forecast the direction of mid-price movements.\nOur experiments show that the use of multi-head temporal attention modules\nleads to enhanced prediction performances compared to baseline models.",

    "abstract": "Active learning is an increasingly important branch of machine learning and a\npowerful technique for natural language processing. The main advantage of\nactive learning is its potential to reduce the amount of labeled data needed to\nlearn high-performing models. A vital aspect of an effective active learning\nalgorithm is the determination of when to stop obtaining additional labeled\ndata. Several leading state-of-the-art stopping methods use a stop set to help\nmake this decision. However, there has been relatively less attention given to\nthe choice of stop set than to the stopping algorithms that are applied on the\nstop set. Different choices of stop sets can lead to significant differences in\nstopping method performance. We investigate the impact of different stop set\nchoices on different stopping methods. This paper shows the choice of the stop\nset can have a significant impact on the performance of stopping methods and\nthe impact is different for stability-based methods from that on\nconfidence-based methods. Furthermore, the unbiased representative stop sets\nsuggested by original authors of methods work better than the systematically\nbiased stop sets used in recently published work, and stopping methods based on\nstabilizing predictions have stronger performance than confidence-based\nstopping methods when unbiased representative stop sets are used. We provide\nthe largest quantity of experimental results on the impact of stop sets to\ndate. The findings are important for helping to illuminate the impact of this\nimportant aspect of stopping methods that has been under-considered in recently\npublished work and that can have a large practical impact on the performance of\nstopping methods for important semantic computing applications such as\ntechnology assisted review and text classification more broadly.",

This paper aims to develop a medicine\nrecommender system called RecoMed to aid the physician in the prescription\nprocess of hypertension by providing information about what medications have\nbeen prescribed by other doctors and figuring out what other medicines can be\nrecommended in addition to the one in question. Methods There are two steps to\nthe developed method: First, association rule mining algorithms are employed to\nfind medicine association rules. The second step entails graph mining and\nclustering to present an enriched recommendation via ATC code, which itself\ncomprises several steps. First, the initial graph is constructed from\nhistorical prescription data. Then, data pruning is performed in the second\nstep, after which the medicines with a high repetition rate are removed at the\ndiscretion of a general medical practitioner. Next, the medicines are matched\nto a well-known medicine classification system called the ATC code to provide\nan enriched recommendation. And finally, the DBSCAN and Louvain algorithms\ncluster medicines in the final step. Results A list of recommended medicines is\nprovided as the system's output, and physicians can choose one or more of the\nmedicines based on the patient's clinical symptoms. Only the medicines of class\n2, related to high blood pressure medications, are used to assess the system's\nperformance.

The task is to find a vertex subset $S$ of exactly $k$ vertices\nthat has value at least (resp. at most for minimization) $t$.

    "abstract": "Representation is a core issue in artificial intelligence. Humans use\ndiscrete language to communicate and learn from each other, while machines use\ncontinuous features (like vector, matrix, or tensor in deep neural networks) to\nrepresent cognitive patterns. Discrete symbols are low-dimensional, decoupled,\nand have strong reasoning ability, while continuous features are\nhigh-dimensional, coupled, and have incredible abstracting capabilities. In\nrecent years, deep learning has developed the idea of continuous representation\nto the extreme, using millions of parameters to achieve high accuracies.\nAlthough this is reasonable from the statistical perspective, it has other\nmajor problems like lacking interpretability, poor generalization, and is easy\nto be attacked. Since both paradigms have strengths and weaknesses, a better\nchoice is to seek reconciliation. In this paper, we make an initial attempt\ntowards this direction. Specifically, we propose to combine symbolism and\nconnectionism principles by using neural networks to derive a discrete\nrepresentation. This process is highly similar to human language, which is a\nnatural combination of discrete symbols and neural systems, where the brain\nprocesses continuous signals and represents intelligence via discrete language.\nTo mimic this functionality, we denote our approach as machine language. By\ndesigning an interactive environment and task, we demonstrated that machines\ncould generate a spontaneous, flexible, and semantic language through\ncooperation. Moreover, through experiments we show that discrete language\nrepresentation has several advantages compared with continuous feature\nrepresentation, from the aspects of interpretability, generalization, and\nrobustness.",

As a result, the model requires\nTerabyte scale parameters to embed the high-dimensional input. Hierarchical\ndistributed GPU parameter server has been proposed to enable GPU with limited\nmemory to train the massive network by leveraging CPU main memory and SSDs as\nsecondary storage. We identify two major challenges in the existing GPU\ntraining framework for massive-scale ad models and propose a collection of\noptimizations to tackle these challenges: (a) the GPU, CPU, SSD rapidly\ncommunicate with each other during the training. The connections between GPUs\nand CPUs are non-uniform due to the hardware topology. The data communication\nroute should be optimized according to the hardware topology; (b) GPUs in\ndifferent computing nodes frequently communicates to synchronize parameters.

Our object characterisation builds\non the generalised polarizability tensor (GPT) object characterisation concept\nand provides an alternative to the compacted GPT (CGPT). We call the new\ncharacterisations harmonic GPTs (HGPTs) as their coefficients correspond to\nproducts of harmonic polynomials. Then, we show that the number of independent\ncoefficients of HGPTs needed to characterise objects can be significantly\nreduced by considering the symmetry group of the object and propose a\nsystematic approach for determining the subspace of symmetric harmonic\npolynomials that is fixed by the group and its dimension. This enable us to\ndetermine the independent HGPT coefficients for different symmetry groups.",

    "title": "Determination of building flood risk maps from LiDAR mobile mapping data",
    "abstract": "With increasing urbanization, flooding is a major challenge for many cities\ntoday. Based on forecast precipitation, topography, and pipe networks, flood\nsimulations can provide early warnings for areas and buildings at risk of\nflooding. Basement windows, doors, and underground garage entrances are common\nplaces where floodwater can flow into a building. Some buildings have been\nprepared or designed considering the threat of flooding, but others have not.\nTherefore, knowing the heights of these facade openings helps to identify\nplaces that are more susceptible to water ingress. However, such data is not\nyet readily available in most cities. Traditional surveying of the desired\ntargets may be used, but this is a very time-consuming and laborious process.\nThis research presents a new process for the extraction of windows and doors\nfrom LiDAR mobile mapping data. Deep learning object detection models are\ntrained to identify these objects. Usually, this requires to provide large\namounts of manual annotations. In this paper, we mitigate this problem by\nleveraging a rule-based method. In a first step, the rule-based method is used\nto generate pseudo-labels. A semi-supervised learning strategy is then applied\nwith three different levels of supervision. The results show that using only\nautomatically generated pseudo-labels, the learning-based model outperforms the\nrule-based approach by 14.6% in terms of F1-score. After five hours of human\nsupervision, it is possible to improve the model by another 6.2%. By comparing\nthe detected facade openings' heights with the predicted water levels from a\nflood simulation model, a map can be produced which assigns per-building flood\nrisk levels. This information can be combined with flood forecasting to provide\na more targeted disaster prevention guide for the city's infrastructure and\nresidential buildings.",

Much research has focused on algorithmic improvements\non individual components, such as navigation, motion planning, and perception.\nIn this paper, we present a UGV-UAV object detection and geolocation system,\nwhich performs perception, navigation, and planning autonomously in real scale\nin unstructured environment.

Our novel hardware-software architecture\nis a solid foundation for system-level and component-level research. Our system\nis validated through data-driven offline tests as well as a series of field\ntests in unstructured environments.

    "abstract": "In this paper a new aggregated model for electric vehicle (EV) fleets is\npresented that considers their daily and weekly usage patterns. A\nfrequency-constrained stochastic unit commitment model is employed to optimally\nschedule EV charging and discharging as well as the provision of frequency\nresponse (FR) in an electricity system, while respecting the vehicles' energy\nrequirements and driving schedules. Through case studies we demonstrate that an\nEV with vehicle to grid (V2G) capability can reduce system costs in a future GB\nelectricity grid by up to {\\pounds}12,000 per year, and reduce CO2 emissions by\n60 tonnes per year, mainly due to reduced curtailment of wind power. The paper\nalso quantifies the changes in the benefits of fleet V2G resulting from\nvariations in FR delivery time, the penetration of wind or uptake of\nalternative flexibility providers. Finally , a battery degradation model\ndependent on an EV's state of charge is proposed and implemented in the\nstochastic scheduling problem. It enables significant degradation cost\nreductions of 16% with only a 0.4% reduction of an EV's system value.",

Current GSL methods\nmainly learn an optimal graph structure (final view) from single or multiple\ninformation sources (basic views), however the theoretical guidance on what is\nthe optimal graph structure is still unexplored. In essence, an optimal graph\nstructure should only contain the information about tasks while compress\nredundant noise as much as possible, which is defined as \"minimal sufficient\nstructure\", so as to maintain the accurancy and robustness.

In the literature survey, we systematically collected and\nanalysed 311 scientific papers spanning five decades and classified them using\nthe cognitive concepts from the taxonomy. Our analysis shows that the most\ndeveloped areas of research correspond to the four life-cycle stages, software\nrequirements, design, construction, and maintenance. Most research is\nquantitative and focuses on knowledge, cognitive load, memory, and reasoning.\nOverall, the state of the art appears fragmented when viewed from the\nperspective of cognition. There is a lack of use of cognitive concepts that\nwould represent a coherent picture of the cognitive processes active in\nspecific tasks. Accordingly, we discuss the research gap in each cognitive\nconcept and provide recommendations for future research.",

    "abstract": "Recent improvements in Extended Reality (XR) technology created an increase\nin XR products and solutions in the industry, while raising new requirements\nfor new or improved architectural concepts. This need can be particularly\ncomplex as XR applications often relate both to 3D geometric rendering and\nmultimedia paradigms. This paper outlines the main concepts relevant to XR,\nboth from a game engineering and multimedia streaming system perspective. XR\nrequires new metadata and media/game orchestration to allow complex interaction\nbetween users, objects, and (volumetric) multimedia content, which also results\nin new requirements on synchronisation (i.e., for global object state and\npositioning). Furthermore, the paper presents the functional blocks needed in\nnew XR system architectures and how they will glue both (game and media) spaces\ntogether. The discussion of functional components and architecture relates to\nthe ongoing activities in relevant standardisation bodies like Khronos, MPEG,\nand 3GPP. To make XR successful on the long term, the industry needs to agree\non interoperable solutions and how to merge both game and media paradigms to\nallow complex multi-user XR applications.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution simulations of particle-based kinetic plasma models typically\nrequire a high number of particles and thus often become computationally\nintractable. This is exacerbated in multi-query simulations, where the problem\ndepends on a set of parameters. In this work, we derive reduced order models\nfor the semi-discrete Hamiltonian system resulting from a geometric\nparticle-in-cell approximation of the parametric Vlasov-Poisson equations.\nSince the problem's non-dissipative and highly nonlinear nature makes it\nreducible only locally in time, we adopt a nonlinear reduced basis approach\nwhere the reduced phase space evolves in time. This strategy allows a\nsignificant reduction in the number of simulated particles, but the evaluation\nof the nonlinear operators associated with the Vlasov-Poisson coupling remains\ncomputationally expensive. We propose a novel reduction of the nonlinear terms\nthat combines adaptive parameter sampling and hyper-reduction techniques to\naddress this. The proposed approach allows decoupling the operations having a\ncost dependent on the number of particles from those that depend on the\ninstances of the required parameters. In particular, in each time step, the\nelectric potential is approximated via dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and the\nparticle-to-grid map via a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM).\nThese approximations are constructed from data obtained from a past temporal\nwindow at a few selected values of the parameters to guarantee a\ncomputationally efficient adaptation. The resulting DMD-DEIM reduced dynamical\nsystem retains the Hamiltonian structure of the full model, provides good\napproximations of the solution, and can be solved at a reduced computational\ncost.",

    "abstract": "Join query evaluation with ordering is a fundamental data processing task in\nrelational database management systems. SQL and custom graph query languages\nsuch as Cypher offer this functionality by allowing users to specify the order\nvia the ORDER BY clause. In many scenarios, the users also want to see the\nfirst $k$ results quickly (expressed by the LIMIT clause), but the value of $k$\nis not predetermined as user queries are arriving in an online fashion. Recent\nwork has made considerable progress in identifying optimal algorithms for\nranked enumeration of join queries that do not contain any projections. In this\npaper, we initiate the study of the problem of enumerating results in ranked\norder for queries with projections. Our main result shows that for any acyclic\nquery, it is possible to obtain a near-linear (in the size of the database)\ndelay algorithm after only a linear time preprocessing step for two important\nranking functions: sum and lexicographic ordering. For a practical subset of\nacyclic queries known as star queries, we show an even stronger result that\nallows a user to obtain a smooth tradeoff between faster answering time\nguarantees using more preprocessing time. Our results are also extensible to\nqueries containing cycles and unions. We also perform a comprehensive\nexperimental evaluation to demonstrate that our algorithms, which are simple to\nimplement, improve up to three orders of magnitude in the running time over\nstate-of-the-art algorithms implemented within open-source RDBMS and\nspecialized graph databases.",

However, due to the much larger model size and unique\narchitecture, how to provide fast MoE model inference remains challenging and\nunsolved, limiting its practical usage. To tackle this, we present\nDeepSpeed-MoE, an end-to-end MoE training and inference solution as part of the\nDeepSpeed library, including novel MoE architecture designs and model\ncompression techniques that reduce MoE model size by up to 3.7x, and a highly\noptimized inference system that provides 7.3x better latency and cost compared\nto existing MoE inference solutions.

    "abstract": "How do neural network image classifiers respond to simpler and simpler\ninputs? And what do such responses reveal about the learning process? To answer\nthese questions, we need a clear measure of input simplicity (or inversely,\ncomplexity), an optimization objective that correlates with simplification, and\na framework to incorporate such objective into training and inference. Lastly\nwe need a variety of testbeds to experiment and evaluate the impact of such\nsimplification on learning. In this work, we measure simplicity with the\nencoding bit size given by a pretrained generative model, and minimize the bit\nsize to simplify inputs in training and inference. We investigate the effect of\nsuch simplification in several scenarios: conventional training, dataset\ncondensation and post-hoc explanations. In all settings, inputs are simplified\nalong with the original classification task, and we investigate the trade-off\nbetween input simplicity and task performance. For images with injected\ndistractors, such simplification naturally removes superfluous information. For\ndataset condensation, we find that inputs can be simplified with almost no\naccuracy degradation. When used in post-hoc explanation, our learning-based\nsimplification approach offers a valuable new tool to explore the basis of\nnetwork decisions.",

    "abstract": "Quantum machine learning is a fast emerging field that aims to tackle machine\nlearning using quantum algorithms and quantum computing. Due to the lack of\nphysical qubits and an effective means to map real-world data from Euclidean\nspace to Hilbert space, most of these methods focus on quantum analogies or\nprocess simulations rather than devising concrete architectures based on\nqubits. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm\nfor graph-structured data, which we refer to as the Decompositional Quantum\nGraph Neural Network (DQGNN). DQGNN implements the GNN theoretical framework\nusing the tensor product and unity matrices representation, which greatly\nreduces the number of model parameters required. When controlled by a classical\ncomputer, DQGNN can accommodate arbitrarily sized graphs by processing\nsubstructures from the input graph using a modestly-sized quantum device. The\narchitecture is based on a novel mapping from real-world data to Hilbert space.\nThis mapping maintains the distance relations present in the data and reduces\ninformation loss. Experimental results show that the proposed method\noutperforms competitive state-of-the-art models with only 1.68\\% parameters\ncompared to those models.",

    "abstract": "Pattern detection and string matching are fundamental problems in computer\nscience and the accelerated expansion of bioinformatics and computational\nbiology have made them a core topic for both disciplines. The SARS-CoV-2\npandemic has made such problems more demanding with hundreds or thousands of\nnew genome variants discovered every week, because of constant mutations, and\nthere is a desperate need for fast and accurate analyses. The requirement for\ncomputational tools for genomic analyses, such as sequence alignment, is very\nimportant, although, in most cases the resources and computational power\nrequired are enormous. The presented Multiple Genome Analytics Framework\ncombines data structures and algorithms, specifically built for text mining and\npattern detection, that can help to efficiently address several computational\nbiology and bioinformatics problems concurrently with minimal resources. A\nsingle execution of advanced algorithms, with space and time complexity\nO(nlogn), is enough to acquire knowledge on all repeated patterns that exist in\nmultiple genome sequences and this information can be used from other\nmeta-algorithms for further meta-analyses. The potential of the proposed\nframework is demonstrated with the analysis of more than 300,000 SARS-CoV-2\ngenome sequences and the detection of all repeated patterns with length up to\n60 nucleotides in these sequences. These results have been used to provide\nanswers to questions such as common patterns among all variants, sequence\nalignment, palindromes and tandem repeats detection, different organism genome\ncomparisons, polymerase chain reaction primers detection, etc.",

For example, it often gets trapped into a local minimum in training,\nand its prediction uncertainty is hard to be assessed. To address these issues,\nwe propose the so-called kernel-expanded stochastic neural network (K-StoNet)\nmodel, which incorporates support vector regression (SVR) as the first hidden\nlayer and reformulates the neural network as a latent variable model. The\nformer maps the input vector into an infinite dimensional feature space via a\nradial basis function (RBF) kernel, ensuring absence of local minima on its\ntraining loss surface.

Compared to traditional deep neural networks, K-StoNet possesses a\ntheoretical guarantee to asymptotically converge to the global optimum and\nenables the prediction uncertainty easily assessed.

In case of multiple outputs the question arises whether\nwe separately fit univariate models or directly follow a multivariate approach.\nFor the latter, several possibilities exist that are, e.g. based on modified\nsplitting or stopping rules for multi-output regression.

However,\nautomatic pathology segmentation can be challenging due to the difficulty of\neffectively exploring the underlying information from the multi-sequence CMR\ndata. This paper aims to tackle the scar and edema segmentation from\nmulti-sequence CMR with a novel auto-weighted supervision framework, where the\ninteractions among different supervised layers are explored under a\ntask-specific objective using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we design a\ncoarse-to-fine framework to boost the small myocardial pathology region\nsegmentation with shape prior knowledge. The coarse segmentation model\nidentifies the left ventricle myocardial structure as a shape prior, while the\nfine segmentation model integrates a pixel-wise attention strategy with an\nauto-weighted supervision model to learn and extract salient pathological\nstructures from the multi-sequence CMR data. Extensive experimental results on\na publicly available dataset from Myocardial pathology segmentation combining\nmulti-sequence CMR (MyoPS 2020) demonstrate our method can achieve promising\nperformance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

Tumor analysis is challenging because of tumor\nmorphology like size, location, texture, and heteromorphic appearance in the\nmedical images. In this regard, a novel two-phase deep learning-based framework\nis proposed to detect and categorize brain tumors in magnetic resonance images\n(MRIs). In the first phase, a novel deep boosted features and ensemble\nclassifiers (DBF-EC) scheme is proposed to detect tumor MRI images from healthy\nindividuals effectively. The deep boosted feature space is achieved through the\ncustomized and well-performing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and\nconsequently, fed into the ensemble of machine learning (ML) classifiers. While\nin the second phase, a new hybrid features fusion-based brain tumor\nclassification approach is proposed, comprised of dynamic-static feature and ML\nclassifier to categorize different tumor types. The dynamic features are\nextracted from the proposed BRAIN-RENet CNN, which carefully learns\nheteromorphic and inconsistent behavior of various tumors, while the static\nfeatures are extracted using HOG. The effectiveness of the proposed two-phase\nbrain tumor analysis framework is validated on two standard benchmark datasets;\ncollected from Kaggle and Figshare containing different types of tumor,\nincluding glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and normal images. Experimental\nresults proved that the proposed DBF-EC detection scheme outperforms and\nachieved accuracy (99.56%), precision (0.9991), recall (0.9899), F1-Score\n(0.9945), MCC (0.9892), and AUC-PR (0.9990).

Large variations in biophysical\nproperties and flow conditions exist in this system necessitating the use of\ndifferent flow models for different geometries and flow regimes. Large\nvariations in biophysical properties and flow conditions exist in this system\nnecessitating the use of different flow models for different geometries and\nflow regimes. In total, we consider four different model types. First, a system\nof 1D nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs is considered to simulate blood flow in larger\narteries with highly elastic vessel walls. Second, we assign 1D linearized\nhyperbolic PDEs to model the smaller arteries with stiffer vessel walls. The\nthird model type consists of ODE systems (0D models). It is used to model the\narterioles and peripheral circulation. Finally, homogenized 3D porous media\nmodels are considered to simulate flow and transport in capillaries and tissue\nwithin the breast volume. Sink terms are used to account for the influence of\nthe venous and lymphatic systems. Combining the four model types, we obtain two\ndifferent 1D-0D-3D coupled models for simulating blood flow and transport\nprocesses: The first 1D-0D-3D model covers the whole path from the aorta to the\nbreast, while the second model is a sub-model obtained by restriction to breast\nvasculature and tissue making possible a significant reduction in computational\ncost.

    "abstract": "In synaptic molecular communication (MC), the activation of postsynaptic\nreceptors by neurotransmitters (NTs) is governed by a stochastic\nreaction-diffusion process. This randomness of synaptic MC contributes to the\nrandomness of the electrochemical downstream signal in the postsynaptic cell,\ncalled postsynaptic membrane potential (PSP). Since the randomness of the PSP\nis relevant for neural computation and learning, characterizing the statistics\nof the PSP is critical. However, the statistical characterization of the\nsynaptic reaction-diffusion process is difficult because the reversible\nbi-molecular reaction of NTs with receptors renders the system nonlinear.\nConsequently, there is currently no model available which characterizes the\nimpact of the statistics of postsynaptic receptor activation on the PSP. In\nthis work, we propose a novel statistical model for the synaptic\nreaction-diffusion process in terms of the chemical master equation (CME). We\nfurther propose a novel numerical method which allows to compute the CME\nefficiently and we use this method to characterize the statistics of the PSP.\nFinally, we present results from stochastic particle-based computer simulations\nwhich validate the proposed models. We show that the biophysical parameters\ngoverning synaptic transmission shape the autocovariance of the receptor\nactivation and, ultimately, the statistics of the PSP. Our results suggest that\nthe processing of the synaptic signal by the postsynaptic cell effectively\nmitigates synaptic noise while the statistical characteristics of the synaptic\nsignal are preserved. The results presented in this paper contribute to a\nbetter understanding of the impact of the randomness of synaptic signal\ntransmission on neuronal information processing.",

Traditional\nmodeling of fiber channels using the split-step Fourier method (SSFM) has long\nbeen regarded as challenging in long-haul wavelength division multiplexing\n(WDM) optical fiber communication systems because it is extremely\ntime-consuming. Here we propose a linear-nonlinear feature decoupling\ndistributed (FDD) waveform modeling scheme to model long-haul WDM fiber\nchannel, where the channel linear effects are modelled by the NLSE-derived\nmodel-driven methods and the nonlinear effects are modelled by the data-driven\ndeep learning methods.

The proposed modeling scheme is demonstrated to\nhave high accuracy, high computing speeds, and robust generalization abilities\nfor different optical launch powers, modulation formats, channel numbers and\ntransmission distances. The total running time of FDD waveform modeling scheme\nfor 41-channel 1040-km fiber transmission is only 3 minutes versus more than 2\nhours using SSFM for each input condition, which achieves a 98% reduction in\ncomputing time.

    "title": "Waveform Learning for Reduced Out-of-Band Emissions Under a Nonlinear  Power Amplifier",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has shown great promise in optimizing various aspects\nof the physical layer processing in wireless communication systems. In this\npaper, we use ML to learn jointly the transmit waveform and the\nfrequency-domain receiver. In particular, we consider a scenario where the\ntransmitter power amplifier is operating in a nonlinear manner, and ML is used\nto optimize the waveform to minimize the out-of-band emissions. The system also\nlearns a constellation shape that facilitates pilotless detection by the\nsimultaneously learned receiver. The simulation results show that such an\nend-to-end optimized system can communicate data more accurately and with less\nout-of-band emissions than conventional systems, thereby demonstrating the\npotential of ML in optimizing the air interface. To the best of our knowledge,\nthere are no prior works considering the power amplifier induced emissions in\nan end-to-end learned system. These findings pave the way towards an ML-native\nair interface, which could be one of the building blocks of 6G.",

    "title": "Probabilistic Mass Mapping with Neural Score Estimation",
    "abstract": "Weak lensing mass-mapping is a useful tool to access the full distribution of\ndark matter on the sky, but because of intrinsic galaxy ellipticies and finite\nfields/missing data, the recovery of dark matter maps constitutes a challenging\nill-posed inverse problem. We introduce a novel methodology allowing for\nefficient sampling of the high-dimensional Bayesian posterior of the weak\nlensing mass-mapping problem, and relying on simulations for defining a fully\nnon-Gaussian prior. We aim to demonstrate the accuracy of the method on\nsimulations, and then proceed to applying it to the mass reconstruction of the\nHST/ACS COSMOS field. The proposed methodology combines elements of Bayesian\nstatistics, analytic theory, and a recent class of Deep Generative Models based\non Neural Score Matching. This approach allows us to do the following: 1) Make\nfull use of analytic cosmological theory to constrain the 2pt statistics of the\nsolution. 2) Learn from cosmological simulations any differences between this\nanalytic prior and full simulations. 3) Obtain samples from the full Bayesian\nposterior of the problem for robust Uncertainty Quantification. We demonstrate\nthe method on the $\\kappa$TNG simulations and find that the posterior mean\nsignificantly outperfoms previous methods (Kaiser-Squires, Wiener filter,\nSparsity priors) both on root-mean-square error and in terms of the Pearson\ncorrelation. We further illustrate the interpretability of the recovered\nposterior by establishing a close correlation between posterior convergence\nvalues and SNR of clusters artificially introduced into a field. Finally, we\napply the method to the reconstruction of the HST/ACS COSMOS field and yield\nthe highest quality convergence map of this field to date.",

Portfolio construction is a process of choosing\na group of stocks and investing in them optimally to maximize the return while\nminimizing the risk. Since the time when Markowitz proposed the Modern\nPortfolio Theory, several advancements have happened in the area of building\nefficient portfolios. An investor can get the best benefit out of the stock\nmarket if the investor invests in an efficient portfolio and could take the buy\nor sell decision in advance, by estimating the future asset value of the\nportfolio with a high level of precision. In this project, we have built an\nefficient portfolio and to predict the future asset value by means of\nindividual stock price prediction of the stocks in the portfolio. As part of\nbuilding an efficient portfolio we have studied multiple portfolio optimization\nmethods beginning with the Modern Portfolio theory. We have built the minimum\nvariance portfolio and optimal risk portfolio for all the five chosen sectors\nby using past daily stock prices over the past five years as the training data,\nand have also conducted back testing to check the performance of the portfolio.\nA comparative study of minimum variance portfolio and optimal risk portfolio\nwith equal weight portfolio is done by backtesting.",

Using rich data from the Ethereum blockchain, mempool, and\nexchanges, we study the effect of EIP-1559, one of the first deployed TFMs that\ndepart from the traditional first-price auction paradigm. We conduct a rigorous\nand comprehensive empirical study to examine its causal effect on blockchain\ntransaction fee dynamics, transaction waiting time and security. Our results\nshow that EIP-1559 improves the user experience by making fee estimation\neasier, mitigating intra-block difference of gas price paid, and reducing\nusers' waiting times. However, EIP-1559 has only a small effect on gas fee\nlevels and consensus security. In addition, we found that when Ether's price is\nmore volatile, the waiting time is significantly higher. We also verify that a\nlarger block size increases the presence of siblings. These findings suggest\nnew directions for improving TFM.",
