    "abstract": "Self-adjoint operators on infinite-dimensional spaces with continuous spectra\nare abundant but do not possess a basis of eigenfunctions. Rather,\ndiagonalization is achieved through spectral measures. The SpecSolve package\n[SIAM Rev., 63(3) (2021), pp. 489--524] computes spectral measures of general\n(self-adjoint) differential and integral operators by combining\nstate-of-the-art adaptive spectral methods with an efficient resolvent-based\nstrategy. The algorithm achieves arbitrarily high orders of convergence in\nterms of a smoothing parameter, allowing computation of both discrete and\ncontinuous spectral components. This article extends SpecSolve to two important\nclasses of operators: singular integro-differential operators and general\noperator pencils. Essential computational steps are performed with\noff-the-shelf spectral methods, including spectral methods on the real line,\nthe ultraspherical spectral method, Chebyshev and Fourier spectral methods, and\nthe ($hp$-adaptive and sparse) ultraspherical spectral element method. This\ncollection illustrates the power and flexibility of SpecSolve's\n\"discretization-oblivious\" paradigm.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we discuss a reduced basis method for linear evolution PDEs,\nwhich is based on the application of the Laplace transform. The main advantage\nof this approach consists in the fact that, differently from time stepping\nmethods, like Runge-Kutta integrators, the Laplace transform allows to compute\nthe solution directly at a given instant, which can be done by approximating\nthe contour integral associated to the inverse Laplace transform by a suitable\nquadrature formula. In terms of the reduced basis methodology, this determines\na significant improvement in the reduction phase - like the one based on the\nclassical proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) - since the number of vectors\nto which the decomposition applies is drastically reduced as it does not\ncontain all intermediate solutions generated along an integration grid by a\ntime stepping method. We show the effectiveness of the method by some\nillustrative parabolic PDEs arising from finance and also provide some evidence\nthat the method we propose, when applied to a simple advection equation, does\nnot suffer the problem of slow decay of singular values which instead affects\nmethods based on time integration of the Cauchy problem arising from space\ndiscretization.",

The results are extended to\ndecoding of lifted interleaved linearized Reed-Solomon (LILRS) codes in the\nsum-subspace metric and interleaved skew Reed-Solomon (ISRS) codes in the skew\nmetric. We generalize fast minimal approximant basis interpolation techniques\nto obtain efficient decoding schemes for ILRS codes (and variants) with\nsubquadratic complexity in the code length.

    "abstract": "When assessing the performance of wireless communication systems operating\nover fading channels, one often encounters the problem of computing\nexpectations of some functional of sums of independent random variables (RVs).\nThe outage probability (OP) at the output of Equal Gain Combining (EGC) and\nMaximum Ratio Combining (MRC) receivers is among the most important performance\nmetrics that falls within this framework. In general, closed form expressions\nof expectations of functionals applied to sums of RVs are out of reach. A naive\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulation is of course an alternative approach. However, this\nmethod requires a large number of samples for rare event problems (small OP\nvalues for instance). Therefore, it is of paramount importance to use variance\nreduction techniques to develop fast and efficient estimation methods. In this\nwork, we use importance sampling (IS), being known for its efficiency in\nrequiring less computations for achieving the same accuracy requirement. In\nthis line, we propose a state-dependent IS scheme based on a stochastic optimal\ncontrol (SOC) formulation to calculate rare events quantities that could be\nwritten in a form of an expectation of some functional of sums of independent\nRVs. Our proposed algorithm is generic and can be applicable without any\nrestriction on the univariate distributions of the different fading\nenvelops/gains or on the functional that is applied to the sum. We apply our\napproach to the Log-Normal distribution to compute the OP at the output of\ndiversity receivers with and without co-channel interference. For each case, we\nshow numerically that the proposed state-dependent IS algorithm compares\nfavorably to most of the well-known estimators dealing with similar problems.",

    "abstract": "Given a polyline on $n$ vertices, the polyline simplification problem asks\nfor a minimum size subsequence of these vertices defining a new polyline whose\ndistance to the original polyline is at most a given threshold under some\ndistance measure. In this paper, we improve the long-standing running time\nbound for the simplification of polylines under the local Fr\\'echet distance.\nThe best algorithm known so far is by Imai and Iri and has a cubic running time\nin $n$. We present an algorithm with a running time of $O(n^2)$ under the $L_1$\nand $L_\\infty$ norm, and $O(n^2 \\log n)$ under $L_{p \\in (1,\\infty)}$\n(including the Euclidean norm $L_2$). Our approach is based on the ideas of\nChan and Chin, who showed that under the local Hausdorff distance, the Imai-Iri\nalgorithm can be improved to run in quadratic time for $L_1$, $L_2$, and\n$L_\\infty$. However, the Hausdorff distance does not take the order of the\npoints along the polyline into account. The Fr\\'echet distance, which is\nsensitive to the course of the polylines, is hence often deemed the superior\ndistance measure for polyline similarity but it also more intricate to compute.\nSo far, the significantly faster simplification algorithms for the Hausdorff\ndistance made them preferable for practical application.

    "abstract": "It has been argued by Thom and Palm that sparsely-connected neural networks\n(SCNs) show improved performance over fully-connected networks (FCNs).\nSuper-regular networks (SRNs) are neural networks composed of a set of stacked\nsparse layers of (epsilon, delta)-super-regular pairs, and randomly permuted\nnode order. Using the Blow-up Lemma, we prove that as a result of the\nindividual super-regularity of each pair of layers, SRNs guarantee a number of\nproperties that make them suitable replacements for FCNs for many tasks. These\nguarantees include edge uniformity across all large-enough subsets, minimum\nnode in- and out-degree, input-output sensitivity, and the ability to embed\npre-trained constructs. Indeed, SRNs have the capacity to act like FCNs, and\neliminate the need for costly regularization schemes like Dropout. We show that\nSRNs perform similarly to X-Nets via readily reproducible experiments, and\noffer far greater guarantees and control over network structure.",

    "abstract": "Spoken language recognition (SLR) refers to the automatic process used to\ndetermine the language present in a speech sample. SLR is an important task in\nits own right, for example, as a tool to analyze or categorize large amounts of\nmulti-lingual data. Further, it is also an essential tool for selecting\ndownstream applications in a work flow, for example, to chose appropriate\nspeech recognition or machine translation models. SLR systems are usually\ncomposed of two stages, one where an embedding representing the audio sample is\nextracted and a second one which computes the final scores for each language.\nIn this work, we approach the SLR task as a detection problem and implement the\nsecond stage as a probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) model. We\nshow that discriminative training of the PLDA parameters gives large gains with\nrespect to the usual generative training. Further, we propose a novel\nhierarchical approach were two PLDA models are trained, one to generate scores\nfor clusters of highly related languages and a second one to generate scores\nconditional to each cluster. The final language detection scores are computed\nas a combination of these two sets of scores. The complete model is trained\ndiscriminatively to optimize a cross-entropy objective. We show that this\nhierarchical approach consistently outperforms the non-hierarchical one for\ndetection of highly related languages, in many cases by large margins.

The success of graph neural\nnetworks is linked to the message-passing mechanism on the graph, however, the\nmessage-aggregating behavior is still not entirely clear in most algorithms. To\nimprove functionality, we propose a new transparent network called Graph\nDecipher to investigate the message-passing mechanism by prioritizing in two\nmain components: the graph structure and node attributes, at the graph,\nfeature, and global levels on a graph under the node classification task.\nHowever, the computation burden now becomes the most significant issue because\nthe relevance of both graph structure and node attributes are computed on a\ngraph. In order to solve this issue, only relevant representative node\nattributes are extracted by graph feature filters, allowing calculations to be\nperformed in a category-oriented manner. Experiments on seven datasets show\nthat Graph Decipher achieves state-of-the-art performance while imposing a\nsubstantially lower computation burden under the node classification task.\nAdditionally, since our algorithm has the ability to explore the representative\nnode attributes by category, it is utilized to alleviate the imbalanced node\nclassification problem on multi-class graph datasets.",

However, many real-world\nproblems, such as social networks, financial transactions, recommendation\nsystems, etc., are dynamic, that is, nodes and edges are added or deleted over\ntime. Therefore, in recent years, dynamic graph neural networks have received\nmore and more attention from researchers. In this work, we propose a novel\ndynamic graph neural network, Efficient-Dyn.

    "abstract": "Random number generation is an important task in a wide variety of critical\napplications including cryptographic algorithms, scientific simulations, and\nindustrial testing tools. True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) produce truly\nrandom data by sampling a physical entropy source that typically requires\ncustom hardware and suffers from long latency. To enable high-bandwidth and\nlow-latency TRNGs on commodity devices, recent works propose TRNGs that use\nDRAM as an entropy source. Although prior works demonstrate promising\nDRAM-based TRNGs, integration of such mechanisms into real systems poses\nchallenges. We identify three challenges for using DRAM-based TRNGs in current\nsystems: (1) generating random numbers can degrade system performance by\nslowing down concurrently-running applications due to the interference between\nRNG and regular memory operations in the memory controller (i.e., RNG\ninterference), (2) this RNG interference can degrade system fairness by\nunfairly prioritizing applications that intensively use random numbers (i.e.,\nRNG applications), and (3) RNG applications can experience significant\nslowdowns due to the high RNG latency. We propose DR-STRaNGe, an end-to-end\nsystem design for DRAM-based TRNGs that (1) reduces the RNG interference by\nseparating RNG requests from regular requests in the memory controller, (2)\nimproves the system fairness with an RNG-aware memory request scheduler, and\n(3) hides the large TRNG latencies using a random number buffering mechanism\nwith a new DRAM idleness predictor that accurately identifies idle DRAM\nperiods. We evaluate DR-STRaNGe using a set of 186 multiprogrammed workloads.\nCompared to an RNG-oblivious baseline system, DR-STRaNGe improves the average\nperformance of non-RNG and RNG applications by 17.9% and 25.1%, respectively.\nDR-STRaNGe improves average system fairness by 32.1% and reduces average energy\nconsumption by 21%.",

While most ADR's are not reported via formal\nchannels, they are often documented in a variety of unstructured conversations\nsuch as social media posts by patients, customer support call transcripts, or\nCRM notes of meetings between healthcare providers and pharma sales reps. In\nthis paper, we propose a natural language processing (NLP) solution that\ndetects ADR's in such unstructured free-text conversations, which improves on\nprevious work in three ways. First, a new Named Entity Recognition (NER) model\nobtains new state-of-the-art accuracy for ADR and Drug entity extraction on the\nADE, CADEC, and SMM4H benchmark datasets (91.75%, 78.76%, and 83.41% F1 scores\nrespectively). Second, two new Relation Extraction (RE) models are introduced -\none based on BioBERT while the other utilizing crafted features over a Fully\nConnected Neural Network (FCNN) - are shown to perform on par with existing\nstate-of-the-art models, and outperform them when trained with a supplementary\nclinician-annotated RE dataset. Third, a new text classification model, for\ndeciding if a conversation includes an ADR, obtains new state-of-the-art\naccuracy on the CADEC dataset (86.69% F1 score). The complete solution is\nimplemented as a unified NLP pipeline in a production-grade library built on\ntop of Apache Spark, making it natively scalable and able to process millions\nof batch or streaming records on commodity clusters.",

Software Defined Network (SDN) is a key technology that can address\nthese requirements, as it decouples the control plane from the data plane of\nthe network devices and logically centralizes the control plane in the SDN\ncontroller. SDN network operating system (ONOS) is a state-of-art SDN\ncontroller that aims to address this important scalability limitation from its\ndesign. An important feature of ONOS is that it allows network administrators\nto configure and manage networks with a high-level of abstraction by using\nIntent specifications. An Intent is a policy expression describing what is the\ndesired outcome rather than how the outcome should be reached. The concept of\nIntents coupled with the distributed storage space are the key components for\nthe theoretical scalability of ONOS. In this paper, we present our evaluation\nof the ONOS Intent northbound interface using a methodology that takes into\nconsideration the interface access method, type of Intent and number of\ninstalled Intents. Our preliminary analysis indicates a linear increase in the\ncomputational cost with regards to the number of submitted Intents, with the\naccess method being a major factor in the overall computational cost.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted distributed learning paradigm in\npractice, which intends to preserve users' data privacy while leveraging the\nentire dataset of all participants for training. In FL, multiple models are\ntrained independently on the users and aggregated centrally to update a global\nmodel in an iterative process. Although this approach is excellent at\npreserving privacy by design, FL still tends to suffer from quality issues such\nas attacks or byzantine faults. Some recent attempts have been made to address\nsuch quality challenges on the robust aggregation techniques for FL. However,\nthe effectiveness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust FL techniques is still\nunclear and lacks a comprehensive study. Therefore, to better understand the\ncurrent quality status and challenges of these SOTA FL techniques in the\npresence of attacks and faults, in this paper, we perform a large-scale\nempirical study to investigate the SOTA FL's quality from multiple angles of\nattacks, simulated faults (via mutation operators), and aggregation (defense)\nmethods. In particular, we perform our study on two generic image datasets and\none real-world federated medical image dataset. We also systematically\ninvestigate the effect of the distribution of attacks/faults over users and the\nindependent and identically distributed (IID) factors, per dataset, on the\nrobustness results. After a large-scale analysis with 496 configurations, we\nfind that most mutators on each individual user have a negligible effect on the\nfinal model. Moreover, choosing the most robust FL aggregator depends on the\nattacks and datasets. Finally, we illustrate that it is possible to achieve a\ngeneric solution that works almost as well or even better than any single\naggregator on all attacks and configurations with a simple ensemble model of\naggregators.",

However, the self-attention module highly\nrelies on the dot product multiplication and dimension alignment among\nquery-key-value features, which cause two problems: (1) The dot product\nmultiplication results in exhaustive and redundant computation. (2) Due to the\nvisual feature map often appearing as a multi-dimensional tensor, reshaping the\nscale of the tensor feature to adapt to the dimension alignment might destroy\nthe internal structure of the tensor feature map. To address these problems,\nthis paper proposes a self-attention plug-in module with its variants, namely,\nSynthesizing Tensor Transformations (STT), for directly processing image tensor\nfeatures. Without computing the dot-product multiplication among\nquery-key-value, the basic STT is composed of the tensor transformation to\nlearn the synthetic attention weight from visual information.

    "abstract": "We study time-series classification (TSC), a fundamental task of time-series\ndata mining. Prior work has approached TSC from two major directions: (1)\nsimilarity-based methods that classify time-series based on the nearest\nneighbors, and (2) deep learning models that directly learn the representations\nfor classification in a data-driven manner. Motivated by the different working\nmechanisms within these two research lines, we aim to connect them in such a\nway as to jointly model time-series similarities and learn the representations.\nThis is a challenging task because it is unclear how we should efficiently\nleverage similarity information. To tackle the challenge, we propose\nSimilarity-Aware Time-Series Classification (SimTSC), a conceptually simple and\ngeneral framework that models similarity information with graph neural networks\n(GNNs). Specifically, we formulate TSC as a node classification problem in\ngraphs, where the nodes correspond to time-series, and the links correspond to\npair-wise similarities. We further design a graph construction strategy and a\nbatch training algorithm with negative sampling to improve training efficiency.\nWe instantiate SimTSC with ResNet as the backbone and Dynamic Time Warping\n(DTW) as the similarity measure. Extensive experiments on the full UCR datasets\nand several multivariate datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nincorporating similarity information into deep learning models in both\nsupervised and semi-supervised settings.

    "abstract": "Several solutions have been proposed in the literature to address the\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) collision avoidance problem. Most of these\nsolutions consider that the ground controller system (GCS) determines the path\nof a UAV before starting a particular mission at hand. Furthermore, these\nsolutions expect the occurrence of collisions based only on the GPS\nlocalization of UAVs as well as via object-detecting sensors placed on board\nUAVs. The sensors' sensitivity to environmental disturbances and the UAVs'\ninfluence on their accuracy impact negatively the efficiency of these\nsolutions. In this vein, this paper proposes a new energy and delay-aware\nphysical collision avoidance solution for UAVs. The solution is dubbed EDC-UAV.\nThe primary goal of EDC-UAV is to build inflight safe UAVs trajectories while\nminimizing the energy consumption and response time. We assume that each UAV is\nequipped with a global positioning system (GPS) sensor to identify its\nposition. Moreover, we take into account the margin error of the GPS to provide\nthe position of a given UAV. The location of each UAV is gathered by a cluster\nhead, which is the UAV that has either the highest autonomy or the greatest\ncomputational capacity. The cluster head runs the EDC-UAV algorithm to control\nthe rest of the UAVs, thus guaranteeing a collision-free mission and minimizing\nthe energy consumption to achieve different purposes. The proper operation of\nour solution is validated through simulations. The obtained results demonstrate\nthe efficiency of EDC-UAV in achieving its design goals.",

The proposed approach leverages alternate models' internal\nlevels of confidence in their own projections.

This\nuse of successively more complex models -- together with the models' internal\npropensity scores to evaluate their likelihood of being correct -- makes it\npossible to substantially reduce resource use while maintaining high standards\nfor classification accuracy. The approach is applied to the digit recognition\nproblem from Google's Street View House Numbers dataset, using Multilayer\nPerceptron (MLP) neural networks trained on high- and low-resolution versions\nof the digit images. The algorithm examines the low-resolution images first,\nonly moving to higher resolution images if the classification from the initial\nlow-resolution pass does not have a high degree of confidence.

To evaluate the safety risk of surrounding vehicles\nand reduce the complexity of the decision-making algorithm, the driving risk\nassessment algorithm is designed with a Gaussian potential field approach. The\ndecision-making cost function is constructed by considering the driving safety\nand passing efficiency of CAVs. Additionally, decision-making constraints are\ndesigned and include safety, comfort, efficiency, control and stability. Based\non the cost function and constraints, the fuzzy coalitional game approach is\napplied to the decision-making issue of CAVs at unsignalized intersections. Two\ntypes of fuzzy coalitions are constructed that reflect both individual and\nsocial benefits. The benefit allocation in the two types of fuzzy coalitions is\nassociated with the driving aggressiveness of CAVs.

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) devices generate massive data that contain a lot\nof valuable information. To enable efficient on-device data analysis, the\nmobile ad hoc computing (MAHC) is a promising solution. It allows IoT or other\nedge devices to share resources among each other via device-to-device\ncommunication links and carry out computation-intensive tasks in a\ncollaborative manner. This paper investigates the vector convolution problem\nusing computing nodes in a MAHC system. A novel dynamic coded convolution\nstrategy with privacy awareness is developed to address the unique features of\nMAHC systems, including node heterogeneity, frequently changing network\ntypologies, time-varying communication and computation resources. Simulation\nresults show its high efficiency and resilience to uncertain stragglers.",

    "abstract": "While advances in multi-agent learning have enabled the training of\nincreasingly complex agents, most existing techniques produce a final policy\nthat is not designed to adapt to a new partner's strategy. However, we would\nlike our AI agents to adjust their strategy based on the strategies of those\naround them. In this work, we study the problem of conditional multi-agent\nimitation learning, where we have access to joint trajectory demonstrations at\ntraining time, and we must interact with and adapt to new partners at test\ntime. This setting is challenging because we must infer a new partner's\nstrategy and adapt our policy to that strategy, all without knowledge of the\nenvironment reward or dynamics. We formalize this problem of conditional\nmulti-agent imitation learning, and propose a novel approach to address the\ndifficulties of scalability and data scarcity. Our key insight is that\nvariations across partners in multi-agent games are often highly structured,\nand can be represented via a low-rank subspace. Leveraging tools from tensor\ndecomposition, our model learns a low-rank subspace over ego and partner agent\nstrategies, then infers and adapts to a new partner strategy by interpolating\nin the subspace. We experiments with a mix of collaborative tasks, including\nbandits, particle, and Hanabi environments. Additionally, we test our\nconditional policies against real human partners in a user study on the\nOvercooked game. Our model adapts better to new partners compared to baselines,\nand robustly handles diverse settings ranging from discrete/continuous actions\nand static/online evaluation with AI/human partners.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the dynamics of competition among organizations with\nunequal expertise. Multi-agent reinforcement learning has been used to simulate\nand understand the impact of various incentive schemes designed to offset such\ninequality. We design Touch-Mark, a game based on well-known\nmulti-agent-particle-environment, where two teams (weak, strong) with unequal\nbut changing skill levels compete against each other. For training such a game,\nwe propose a novel controller assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning\nalgorithm \\our\\, which empowers each agent with an ensemble of policies along\nwith a supervised controller that by selectively partitioning the sample space,\ntriggers intelligent role division among the teammates. Using C-MADDPG as an\nunderlying framework, we propose an incentive scheme for the weak team such\nthat the final rewards of both teams become the same. We find that in spite of\nthe incentive, the final reward of the weak team falls short of the strong\nteam. On inspecting, we realize that an overall incentive scheme for the weak\nteam does not incentivize the weaker agents within that team to learn and\nimprove. To offset this, we now specially incentivize the weaker player to\nlearn and as a result, observe that the weak team beyond an initial phase\nperforms at par with the stronger team. The final goal of the paper has been to\nformulate a dynamic incentive scheme that continuously balances the reward of\nthe two teams. This is achieved by devising an incentive scheme enriched with\nan RL agent which takes minimum information from the environment.",

    "abstract": "Online technical forums (e.g., StackOverflow) are popular platforms for\ndevelopers to discuss technical problems such as how to use specific\nApplication Programming Interface (API), how to solve the programming tasks, or\nhow to fix bugs in their codes. These discussions can often provide auxiliary\nknowledge of how to use the software that is not covered by the official\ndocuments. The automatic extraction of such knowledge will support a set of\ndownstream tasks like API searching or indexing. However, unlike official\ndocumentation written by experts, discussions in open forums are made by\nregular developers who write in short and informal texts, including spelling\nerrors or abbreviations. There are three major challenges for the accurate APIs\nrecognition and linking mentioned APIs from unstructured natural language\ndocuments to an entry in the API repository: (1) distinguishing API mentions\nfrom common words; (2) identifying API mentions without a fully qualified name;\nand (3) disambiguating API mentions with similar method names but in a\ndifferent library. In this paper, to tackle these challenges, we propose an\nARCLIN tool, which can effectively distinguish and link APIs without using\nhuman annotations. Specifically, we first design an API recognizer to\nautomatically extract API mentions from natural language sentences by a\nCondition Random Field (CRF) on the top of a Bi-directional Long Short-Term\nMemory (Bi-LSTM) module, then we apply a context-aware scoring mechanism to\ncompute the mention-entry similarity for each entry in an API repository.\nCompared to previous approaches with heuristic rules, our proposed tool without\nmanual inspection outperforms by 8% in a high-quality dataset Py-mention, which\ncontains 558 mentions and 2,830 sentences from five popular Python libraries.",

AI is heavily invested in both industry and academy. However, there is\nalso a lot of hype in the current AI debate. AI based on so-called deep\nlearning has achieved impressive results in many problems, but its limits are\nalready visible. AI has been under research since the 1940s, and the industry\nhas seen many ups and downs due to over-expectations and related\ndisappointments that have followed.\nThe purpose of this book is to give a realistic picture of AI, its history,\nits potential and limitations. We believe that AI is a helper, not a ruler of\nhumans. We begin by describing what AI is and how it has evolved over the\ndecades. After fundamentals, we explain the importance of massive data for the\ncurrent mainstream of artificial intelligence. The most common representations\nfor AI, methods, and machine learning are covered. In addition, the main\napplication areas are introduced. Computer vision has been central to the\ndevelopment of AI. The book provides a general introduction to computer vision,\nand includes an exposure to the results and applications of our own research.\nEmotions are central to human intelligence, but little use has been made in AI.\nWe present the basics of emotional intelligence and our own research on the\ntopic. We discuss super-intelligence that transcends human understanding,\nexplaining why such achievement seems impossible on the basis of present\nknowledge,and how AI could be improved. Finally, a summary is made of the\ncurrent state of AI and what to do in the future. In the appendix, we look at\nthe development of AI education, especially from the perspective of contents at\nour own university.",

We apply a series of different complexity measures to three\ndifferent evolutionary art datasets and look at the correlations between\ncomplexity and individual aesthetic judgement by the artist (in the case of two\ndatasets) or the physically measured complexity of generative 3D forms. Our\nresults show that the degree of correlation is different for each set and\nmeasure, indicating that there is no overall \"better\" measure. However,\nspecific measures do perform well on individual datasets, indicating that\ncareful choice can increase the value of using such measures. We then assess\nthe value of complexity measures for the audience by undertaking a large-scale\nsurvey on the perception of complexity and aesthetics. We conclude by\ndiscussing the value of direct measures in generative and evolutionary art,\nreinforcing recent findings from neuroimaging and psychology which suggest\nhuman aesthetic judgement is informed by many extrinsic factors beyond the\nmeasurable properties of the object being judged.",

    "abstract": "Binary memristive crossbars have gained huge attention as an energy-efficient\ndeep learning hardware accelerator. Nonetheless, they suffer from various\nnoises due to the analog nature of the crossbars. To overcome such limitations,\nmost previous works train weight parameters with noise data obtained from a\ncrossbar. These methods are, however, ineffective because it is difficult to\ncollect noise data in large-volume manufacturing environment where each\ncrossbar has a large device/circuit level variation. Moreover, we argue that\nthere is still room for improvement even though these methods somewhat improve\naccuracy. This paper explores a new perspective on mitigating crossbar noise in\na more generalized way by manipulating input binary bit encoding rather than\ntraining the weight of networks with respect to noise data. We first\nmathematically show that the noise decreases as the number of binary bit\nencoding pulses increases when representing the same amount of information. In\naddition, we propose Gradient-based Bit Encoding Optimization (GBO) which\noptimizes a different number of pulses at each layer, based on our in-depth\nanalysis that each layer has a different level of noise sensitivity. The\nproposed heterogeneous layer-wise bit encoding scheme achieves high noise\nrobustness with low computational cost. Our experimental results on public\nbenchmark datasets show that GBO improves the classification accuracy by ~5-40%\nin severe noise scenarios.",

DisCOIL follows the\nbasic principle of POC, but it adopts variational auto-encoders (VAE) instead\nof other well-established one-class classifiers (e.g. deep SVDD), because a\ntrained VAE can not only identify the probability of an input sample belonging\nto a class but also generate pseudo samples of the class to assist in learning\nnew tasks. With this advantage, DisCOIL trains a new-class VAE in contrast with\nthe old-class VAEs, which forces the new-class VAE to reconstruct better for\nnew-class samples but worse for the old-class pseudo samples, thus enhancing\nthe comparability. Furthermore, DisCOIL introduces a hinge reconstruction loss\nto ensure the discriminability. We evaluate our method extensively on MNIST,\nCIFAR10, and Tiny-ImageNet. The experimental results show that DisCOIL achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "This work studies the bias issue of pseudo-labeling, a natural phenomenon\nthat widely occurs but often overlooked by prior research. Pseudo-labels are\ngenerated when a classifier trained on source data is transferred to unlabeled\ntarget data. We observe heavy long-tailed pseudo-labels when a semi-supervised\nlearning model FixMatch predicts labels on the unlabeled set even though the\nunlabeled data is curated to be balanced. Without intervention, the training\nmodel inherits the bias from the pseudo-labels and end up being sub-optimal. To\neliminate the model bias, we propose a simple yet effective method DebiasMatch,\ncomprising of an adaptive debiasing module and an adaptive marginal loss. The\nstrength of debiasing and the size of margins can be automatically adjusted by\nmaking use of an online updated queue. Benchmarked on ImageNet-1K, DebiasMatch\nsignificantly outperforms previous state-of-the-arts by more than 26% and 8.7%\non semi-supervised learning (0.2% annotated data) and zero-shot learning tasks\nrespectively.",

Numerical solutions on the other hand\nrequire fine discretization and are computationally very demanding.\nConsequently, the models are normally not suitable for real-time monitoring and\ncontrol purposes. In this contribution, a reduced-order modeling method for a\ngeneral ADR system with time-varying coefficients is proposed. Optimality of\nthe reduced-order model regarding the reduction induced error is achieved by\nusing a $\\mathcal{H}_2$-norm reduction method. The efficacy of the method is\ndemonstrated using two test cases.

Second, many\nexisting pre-trained models, including state-of-the-art models such as\nT5-learning, simply reuse the pre-training tasks designed for natural\nlanguages. Moreover, to learn the natural language description of source code\nneeded eventually for code-related tasks such as code summarization, existing\npre-training tasks require a bilingual corpus composed of source code and the\nassociated natural language description, which severely limits the amount of\ndata for pre-training. To this end, we propose SPT-Code, a sequence-to-sequence\npre-trained model for source code. In order to pre-train SPT-Code in a\nsequence-to-sequence manner and address the aforementioned weaknesses\nassociated with existing pre-training tasks, we introduce three pre-training\ntasks that are specifically designed to enable SPT-Code to learn knowledge of\nsource code, the corresponding code structure, as well as a natural language\ndescription of the code without relying on any bilingual corpus, and eventually\nexploit these three sources of information when it is applied to downstream\ntasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SPT-Code achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on five code-related downstream tasks after fine-tuning.",

    "abstract": "The Searching on Sorted Data ({\\bf SOSD}, in short) is a highly engineered\nsoftware platform for benchmarking Learned Indexes, those latter being a novel\nand quite effective proposal of how to search in a sorted table by combining\nMachine Learning techniques with classic Algorithms. In such a platform and in\nthe related benchmarking experiments, following a natural and intuitive choice,\nthe final search stage is performed via the Standard (textbook) Binary Search\nprocedure. However, recent studies, that do not use Machine Learning\npredictions, indicate that Uniform Binary Search, streamlined to avoid\n\\vir{branching} in the main loop, is superior in performance to its Standard\ncounterpart when the table to be searched into is relatively small, e.g.,\nfitting in L1 or L2 cache. Analogous results hold for k-ary Search, even on\nlarge tables. One would expect an analogous behaviour within Learned Indexes.\nVia a set of extensive experiments, coherent with the State of the Art, we show\nthat for Learned Indexes, and as far as the {\\bf SOSD} software is concerned,\nthe use of the Standard routine (either Binary or k-ary Search) is superior to\nthe Uniform one, across all the internal memory levels. This fact provides a\nquantitative justification of the natural choice made so far. Our experiments\nalso indicate that Uniform Binary and k-ary Search can be advantageous to use\nin order to save space in Learned Indexes, while granting a good performance in\ntime. Our findings are of methodological relevance for this novel and\nfast-growing area and informative to practitioners interested in using Learned\nIndexes in application domains, e.g., Data Bases and Search Engines.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the goal of achieving long-term drift-free camera pose\nestimation in complex scenarios, we propose a global positioning framework\nfusing visual, inertial and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\nmeasurements in multiple layers. Different from previous loosely- and tightly-\ncoupled methods, the proposed multi-layer fusion allows us to delicately\ncorrect the drift of visual odometry and keep reliable positioning while GNSS\ndegrades. In particular, local motion estimation is conducted in the\ninner-layer, solving the problem of scale drift and inaccurate bias estimation\nin visual odometry by fusing the velocity of GNSS, pre-integration of Inertial\nMeasurement Unit (IMU) and camera measurement in a tightly-coupled way. The\nglobal localization is achieved in the outer-layer, where the local motion is\nfurther fused with GNSS position and course in a long-term period in a\nloosely-coupled way. Furthermore, a dedicated initialization method is proposed\nto guarantee fast and accurate estimation for all state variables and\nparameters. We give exhaustive tests of the proposed framework on indoor and\noutdoor public datasets. The mean localization error is reduced up to 63%, with\na promotion of 69% in initialization accuracy compared with state-of-the-art\nworks.

    "abstract": "This paper presents how learning experience influences students' capability\nto learn and their motivation for learning. Although each student is different,\nstandard instruction methods do not adapt to individuals. Adaptive learning\nreverses this practice and attempts to improve the student experience. While\nadaptive learning is well-established in programming, it is rarely used in\ncybersecurity education. This paper is one of the first works investigating\nadaptive learning in security training. First, we analyze the performance of 95\nstudents in 12 training sessions to understand the limitations of the current\ntraining practice. Less than half of the students completed the training\nwithout displaying a solution, and only in two sessions, all students completed\nall phases. Then, we simulate how students would proceed in one of the past\ntraining sessions if it would offer more paths of various difficulty. Based on\nthis simulation, we propose a novel tutor model for adaptive training, which\nconsiders students' proficiency before and during an ongoing training session.\nThe proficiency is assessed using a pre-training questionnaire and various\nin-training metrics. Finally, we conduct a study with 24 students and new\ntraining using the proposed tutor model and adaptive training format. The\nresults show that the adaptive training does not overwhelm students as the\noriginal static training. Adaptive training enables students to enter several\nalternative training phases with lower difficulty than the original training.\nThe proposed format is not restricted to a particular training. Therefore, it\ncan be applied to practicing any security topic or even in related fields, such\nas networking or operating systems. Our study indicates that adaptive learning\nis a promising approach for improving the student experience in security\neducation. We also highlight implications for educational practice.",

Moreover,\nthe design synthesis approaches in the literature predominantly utilize\nheuristic optimizers leading to suboptimal local minima.\nThis research introduces a convenient optimization workflow allowing wide\nindustrial adoption, while guaranteeing to reveal the global optimum. To\nguarantee that we find the global optimum, a mathematical expression of the\nconstraints describing the feasible region of possible designs is of great\nimportance. Therefore, kinematic analysis of the point-to-point (PTP) planar\nfour-bar mechanism is discussed to obtain the static and dynamic constraints.\nWithin the feasible region, objective value samples are generated through CAD\nmulti-body software. These motion simulations determine the required torque to\nfulfill the movement for a certain combination of design parameters.

Unlike centralized training that is\nusually based on carefully-organized data, FL deals with on-device data that\nare often unfiltered and imbalanced. As a result, conventional FL training\nprotocol that treats all data equally leads to a waste of local computational\nresources and slows down the global learning process. To this end, we propose\nFedBalancer, a systematic FL framework that actively selects clients' training\nsamples. Our sample selection strategy prioritizes more \"informative\" data\nwhile respecting privacy and computational capabilities of clients. To better\nutilize the sample selection to speed up global training, we further introduce\nan adaptive deadline control scheme that predicts the optimal deadline for each\nround with varying client train data. Compared with existing FL algorithms with\ndeadline configuration methods, our evaluation on five datasets from three\ndifferent domains shows that FedBalancer improves the time-to-accuracy\nperformance by 1.22~4.62x while improving the model accuracy by 1.0~3.3%. We\nalso show that FedBalancer is readily applicable to other FL approaches by\ndemonstrating that FedBalancer improves the convergence speed and accuracy when\noperating jointly with three different FL algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Most previous learning-based graph matching algorithms solve the\n\\textit{quadratic assignment problem} (QAP) by dropping one or more of the\nmatching constraints and adopting a relaxed assignment solver to obtain\nsub-optimal correspondences. Such relaxation may actually weaken the original\ngraph matching problem, and in turn hurt the matching performance. In this\npaper we propose a deep learning-based graph matching framework that works for\nthe original QAP without compromising on the matching constraints. In\nparticular, we design an affinity-assignment prediction network to jointly\nlearn the pairwise affinity and estimate the node assignments, and we then\ndevelop a differentiable solver inspired by the probabilistic perspective of\nthe pairwise affinities. Aiming to obtain better matching results, the\nprobabilistic solver refines the estimated assignments in an iterative manner\nto impose both discrete and one-to-one matching constraints.

However in the web domain we are in a\nsetting with large amounts of training data and a query-to-passage or a\nquery-to-document retrieval task. We investigate in this paper dense\ndocument-to-document retrieval with limited labelled target data for training,\nin particular legal case retrieval. In order to use DPR models for\ndocument-to-document retrieval, we propose a Paragraph Aggregation Retrieval\nModel (PARM) which liberates DPR models from their limited input length. PARM\nretrieves documents on the paragraph-level: for each query paragraph, relevant\ndocuments are retrieved based on their paragraphs. Then the relevant results\nper query paragraph are aggregated into one ranked list for the whole query\ndocument. For the aggregation we propose vector-based aggregation with\nreciprocal rank fusion (VRRF) weighting, which combines the advantages of\nrank-based aggregation and topical aggregation based on the dense embeddings.\nExperimental results show that VRRF outperforms rank-based aggregation\nstrategies for dense document-to-document retrieval with PARM.

    "abstract": "Multi-scale representations are crucial for semantic segmentation. The\ncommunity has witnessed the flourish of semantic segmentation convolutional\nneural networks (CNN) exploiting multi-scale contextual information. Motivated\nby that the vision transformer (ViT) is powerful in image classification, some\nsemantic segmentation ViTs are recently proposed, most of them attaining\nimpressive results but at a cost of computational economy. In this paper, we\nsucceed in introducing multi-scale representations into semantic segmentation\nViT via window attention mechanism and further improves the performance and\nefficiency. To this end, we introduce large window attention which allows the\nlocal window to query a larger area of context window at only a little\ncomputation overhead. By regulating the ratio of the context area to the query\narea, we enable the large window attention to capture the contextual\ninformation at multiple scales. Moreover, the framework of spatial pyramid\npooling is adopted to collaborate with the large window attention, which\npresents a novel decoder named large window attention spatial pyramid pooling\n(LawinASPP) for semantic segmentation ViT. Our resulting ViT, Lawin\nTransformer, is composed of an efficient hierachical vision transformer (HVT)\nas encoder and a LawinASPP as decoder. The empirical results demonstrate that\nLawin Transformer offers an improved efficiency compared to the existing\nmethod. Lawin Transformer further sets new state-of-the-art performance on\nCityscapes (84.4\\% mIoU), ADE20K (56.2\\% mIoU) and COCO-Stuff datasets.

    "abstract": "Advances in deep learning have enabled a wide range of promising\napplications. However, these systems are vulnerable to Adversarial Machine\nLearning (AML) attacks; adversarially crafted perturbations to their inputs\ncould cause them to misclassify. Several state-of-the-art adversarial attacks\nhave demonstrated that they can reliably fool classifiers making these attacks\na significant threat. Adversarial attack generation algorithms focus primarily\non creating successful examples while controlling the noise magnitude and\ndistribution to make detection more difficult. The underlying assumption of\nthese attacks is that the adversarial noise is generated offline, making their\nexecution time a secondary consideration. However, recently, just-in-time\nadversarial attacks where an attacker opportunistically generates adversarial\nexamples on the fly have been shown to be possible. This paper introduces a new\nproblem: how do we generate adversarial noise under real-time constraints to\nsupport such real-time adversarial attacks? Understanding this problem improves\nour understanding of the threat these attacks pose to real-time systems and\nprovides security evaluation benchmarks for future defenses. Therefore, we\nfirst conduct a run-time analysis of adversarial generation algorithms.\nUniversal attacks produce a general attack offline, with no online overhead,\nand can be applied to any input; however, their success rate is limited because\nof their generality. In contrast, online algorithms, which work on a specific\ninput, are computationally expensive, making them inappropriate for operation\nunder time constraints. Thus, we propose ROOM, a novel Real-time Online-Offline\nattack construction Model where an offline component serves to warm up the\nonline algorithm, making it possible to generate highly successful attacks\nunder time constraints.",

However, the sensitivity of conventional vision\nsensors to lighting conditions and high-speed motion sets a limitation on the\nreliability and work-rate of production lines. Neuromorphic vision is a recent\ntechnology with the potential to address the challenges of conventional vision\nwith its high temporal resolution, low latency, and wide dynamic range. In this\npaper and for the first time, we propose a novel neuromorphic vision based\ncontroller for faster and more reliable machining operations, and present a\ncomplete robotic system capable of performing drilling tasks with\nsub-millimeter accuracy. Our proposed system localizes the target workpiece in\n3D using two perception stages that we developed specifically for the\nasynchronous output of neuromorphic cameras. The first stage performs\nmulti-view reconstruction for an initial estimate of the workpiece's pose, and\nthe second stage refines this estimate for a local region of the workpiece\nusing circular hole detection. The robot then precisely positions the drilling\nend-effector and drills the target holes on the workpiece using a combined\nposition-based and image-based visual servoing approach. The proposed solution\nis validated experimentally for drilling nutplate holes on workpieces placed\narbitrarily in an unstructured environment with uncontrolled lighting.\nExperimental results prove the effectiveness of our solution with an average\npositional errors of less than 0.1 mm, and demonstrate that the use of\nneuromorphic vision overcomes the lighting and speed limitations of\nconventional cameras.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed growing interests in online incremental learning.\nHowever, there are three major challenges in this area. The first major\ndifficulty is concept drift, that is, the probability distribution in the\nstreaming data would change as the data arrives. The second major difficulty is\ncatastrophic forgetting, that is, forgetting what we have learned before when\nlearning new knowledge. The last one we often ignore is the learning of the\nlatent representation. Only good latent representation can improve the\nprediction accuracy of the model. Our research builds on this observation and\nattempts to overcome these difficulties. To this end, we propose an Adaptive\nOnline Incremental Learning for evolving data streams (AOIL). We use\nauto-encoder with the memory module, on the one hand, we obtained the latent\nfeatures of the input, on the other hand, according to the reconstruction loss\nof the auto-encoder with memory module, we could successfully detect the\nexistence of concept drift and trigger the update mechanism, adjust the model\nparameters in time. In addition, we divide features, which are derived from the\nactivation of the hidden layers, into two parts, which are used to extract the\ncommon and private features respectively. By means of this approach, the model\ncould learn the private features of the new coming instances, but do not forget\nwhat we have learned in the past (shared features), which reduces the\noccurrence of catastrophic forgetting. At the same time, to get the fusion\nfeature vector we use the self-attention mechanism to effectively fuse the\nextracted features, which further improved the latent representation learning.",

The knowledge presented in the literature\nneeds to be systematized in such a ways that claims and hypothesis can be\neasily found, accessed and validated. Knowledge graphs can provide such\nframework for semantic knowledge representation from literature. However, in\norder to build knowledge graph, it is necessary to extract knowledge in form of\nrelationships between biomedical entities and normalize both entities and\nrelationship types. In this paper, we present and compare few rule-based and\nmachine learning-based (Naive Bayes, Random Forests as examples of traditional\nmachine learning methods and T5-based model as an example of modern deep\nlearning) methods for scalable relationship extraction from biomedical\nliterature for the integration into the knowledge graphs. We examine how\nresilient are these various methods to unbalanced and fairly small datasets,\nshowing that T5 model handles well both small datasets, due to its pre-training\non large C4 dataset as well as unbalanced data. The best performing model was\nT5 model fine-tuned on balanced data, with reported F1-score of 0.88.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of browsers has steadily increased over the years, driven by\nthe continuous introduction and update of Web platform components, such as\nnovel Web APIs and security mechanisms. Their specifications are manually\nreviewed by experts to identify potential security issues. However, this\nprocess has proved to be error-prone due to the extensiveness of modern browser\nspecifications and the interplay between new and existing Web platform\ncomponents. To tackle this problem, we developed WebSpec, the first formal\nsecurity framework for the analysis of browser security mechanisms, which\nenables both the automatic discovery of logical flaws and the development of\nmachine-checked security proofs. WebSpec, in particular, includes a\ncomprehensive semantic model of the browser in the Coq proof assistant, a\nformalization in this model of ten Web security invariants, and a compiler\nturning the Coq model and the Web invariants into SMT-lib formulas.\nWe showcase the effectiveness of WebSpec by discovering two new logical flaws\ncaused by the interaction of different browser mechanisms and by identifying\nthree previously discovered logical flaws in the current Web platform, as well\nas five in old versions. Finally, we show how WebSpec can aid the verification\nof our proposed changes to amend the reported inconsistencies affecting the\ncurrent Web platform.",

    "abstract": "The present work proposes a versatile computational modeling framework for\nsimulating coupled microfluid-powder dynamics problems involving\nthermo-capillary flow and reversible phase transitions. A liquid and a gas\nphase are interacting with a solid phase that is assumed to consist of a\nsubstrate and several arbitrarily-shaped mobile rigid bodies while\nsimultaneously considering surface tension and wetting effects. All phases are\nspatially discretized using smoothed particle hydrodynamics because its\nLagrangian nature is beneficial in the context of dynamically changing\ninterface topologies. The proposed modeling framework is especially suitable\nfor meso- and microscale modeling of complex physical phenomena in additive\nmanufacturing processes such as binder jetting, material jetting, directed\nenergy deposition, and powder bed fusion. To this end, the generality and\nrobustness of the computational modeling framework is demonstrated by several\napplication-motivated examples in three dimensions. In summary, the proposed\nmodeling framework can serve as a valuable tool for detailed studies of\ndifferent additive manufacturing processes and thus help to increase the\nfundamental understanding of relevant process physics.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents local minimax regret lower bounds for adaptively\ncontrolling linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) systems. We consider smoothly\nparametrized instances and provide an understanding of when logarithmic regret\nis impossible which is both instance specific and flexible enough to take\nproblem structure into account. This understanding relies on two key notions:\nThat of local-uninformativeness; when the optimal policy does not provide\nsufficient excitation for identification of the optimal policy, and yields a\ndegenerate Fisher information matrix; and that of\ninformation-regret-boundedness, when the small eigenvalues of a\npolicy-dependent information matrix are boundable in terms of the regret of\nthat policy. Combined with a reduction to Bayesian estimation and application\nof Van Trees' inequality, these two conditions are sufficient for proving\nregret bounds on order of magnitude $\\sqrt{T}$ in the time horizon, $T$. This\nmethod yields lower bounds that exhibit tight dimensional dependencies and\nscale naturally with control-theoretic problem constants. For instance, we are\nable to prove that systems operating near marginal stability are fundamentally\nhard to learn to control. We further show that large classes of systems satisfy\nthese conditions, among them any state-feedback system with both $A$- and\n$B$-matrices unknown. Most importantly, we also establish that a nontrivial\nclass of partially observable systems, essentially those that are\nover-actuated, satisfy these conditions, thus providing a $\\sqrt{T}$ lower\nbound also valid for partially observable systems. Finally, we turn to two\nsimple examples which demonstrate that our lower bound captures classical\ncontrol-theoretic intuition: our lower bounds diverge for systems operating\nnear marginal stability or with large filter gain -- these can be arbitrarily\nhard to (learn to) control.",

As modern machine learning models become increasingly larger, they\nrequire a longer time to train, leading to higher GPU energy consumption.

GPOEO employs multi-objective models\nbased on gradient boosting and a local search algorithm to find a trade-off\nbetween execution time and energy consumption. We evaluate the GPOEO by\napplying it to 71 machine learning workloads from two AI benchmark suites\nrunning on an NVIDIA RTX3080Ti GPU.

    "abstract": "Self-supervision is recently surging at its new frontier of graph learning.\nIt facilitates graph representations beneficial to downstream tasks; but its\nsuccess could hinge on domain knowledge for handcraft or the often expensive\ntrials and errors. Even its state-of-the-art representative, graph contrastive\nlearning (GraphCL), is not completely free of those needs as GraphCL uses a\nprefabricated prior reflected by the ad-hoc manual selection of graph data\naugmentations. Our work aims at advancing GraphCL by answering the following\nquestions: How to represent the space of graph augmented views? What principle\ncan be relied upon to learn a prior in that space? And what framework can be\nconstructed to learn the prior in tandem with contrastive learning?\nAccordingly, we have extended the prefabricated discrete prior in the\naugmentation set, to a learnable continuous prior in the parameter space of\ngraph generators, assuming that graph priors per se, similar to the concept of\nimage manifolds, can be learned by data generation. Furthermore, to form\ncontrastive views without collapsing to trivial solutions due to the prior\nlearnability, we have leveraged both principles of information minimization\n(InfoMin) and information bottleneck (InfoBN) to regularize the learned priors.\nEventually, contrastive learning, InfoMin, and InfoBN are incorporated\norganically into one framework of bi-level optimization. Our principled and\nautomated approach has proven to be competitive against the state-of-the-art\ngraph self-supervision methods, including GraphCL, on benchmarks of small\ngraphs; and shown even better generalizability on large-scale graphs, without\nresorting to human expertise or downstream validation.

    "title": "Multi Document Reading Comprehension",
    "abstract": "Reading Comprehension (RC) is a task of answering a question from a given\npassage or a set of passages. In the case of multiple passages, the task is to\nfind the best possible answer to the question. Recent trials and experiments in\nthe field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have proved that machines can be\nprovided with the ability to not only process the text in the passage and\nunderstand its meaning to answer the question from the passage, but also can\nsurpass the Human Performance on many datasets such as Standford's Question\nAnswering Dataset (SQuAD). This paper presents a study on Reading Comprehension\nand its evolution in Natural Language Processing over the past few decades. We\nshall also study how the task of Single Document Reading Comprehension acts as\na building block for our Multi-Document Reading Comprehension System. In the\nlatter half of the paper, we'll be studying about a recently proposed model for\nMulti-Document Reading Comprehension - RE3QA that is comprised of a Reader,\nRetriever, and a Re-ranker based network to fetch the best possible answer from\na given set of passages.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have proved hugely successful, achieving human-like\nperformance on a variety of tasks. However, they are also computationally\nexpensive, which has motivated the development of model compression techniques\nwhich reduce the resource consumption associated with deep learning models.\nNevertheless, recent studies have suggested that model compression can have an\nadverse effect on algorithmic fairness, amplifying existing biases in machine\nlearning models. With this project we aim to extend those studies to the\ncontext of facial expression recognition. To do that, we set up a neural\nnetwork classifier to perform facial expression recognition and implement\nseveral model compression techniques on top of it. We then run experiments on\ntwo facial expression datasets, namely the Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+DB)\nand the Real-World Affective Faces Database (RAF-DB), to examine the individual\nand combined effect that compression techniques have on the model size,\naccuracy and fairness. Our experimental results show that: (i) Compression and\nquantisation achieve significant reduction in model size with minimal impact on\noverall accuracy for both CK+DB and RAF-DB; (ii) in terms of model accuracy,\nthe classifier trained and tested on RAF-DB seems more robust to compression\ncompared to the CK+ DB; (iii) for RAF-DB, the different compression strategies\ndo not seem to increase the gap in predictive performance across the sensitive\nattributes of gender, race and age which is in contrast with the results on the\nCK+DB, where compression seems to amplify existing biases for gender.

Thus, effective SCA methods that do not depend on the key\nprocessed in the cryptographic operations are beneficially and can be a part of\nthe efficient design methodology for implementing cryptographic approaches. In\nthis work we compare two different methods that are used to analyse power\ntraces of elliptic curve point multiplications.

    "abstract": "Modern and future high precision pointing space missions face increasingly\nhigh challenges related to the widespread use of large flexible structures. The\ndevelopment of new modeling tools which are able to account for the\nmultidisciplinary nature of this problem becomes extremely relevant in order to\nmeet both structure and control performance criteria. This paper proposes a\nnovel methodology to analytically model large truss structures in a\nsub-structuring framework. A three dimensional unit cube element has been\ndesigned and validated with a Finite Element commercial software. This model is\ncomposed by multiple two-dimensional sub-mechanisms assembled using\nblock-diagram models. This constitutes the building block for constructing\ncomplex truss structures by repetitions of the element. The accurate vibration\ndescription of the system and its minimal representation, as well as the\npossibility of accounting for parametric uncertainties in its mechanical\nparameters, make it an appropriate tool to perform robust Structure/Control\nco-design. In order to demonstrate the strengths of the proposed approach, a\nco-design study case is proposed by combining a multidisciplinary optimization\napproach based on particle swarm algorithm and multiple structured robust\nHinf-synthesis. This has been used to optimize the pointing performances of an\nhigh pointing antenna, minimizing the perturbations coming from the Solar Array\nMechanisms (SADM) of two solar panels, performing active control by means of\nmultiple proof mass actuators, and simultaneously reduce the mass of the\ntruss-structure which connects the antenna to the main spacecraft body.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit the question of how the dynamic optimality of\nsearch trees should be defined in external memory. A defining characteristic of\nexternal-memory data structures is that there is a stark asymmetry between\nqueries and inserts/updates/deletes: by making the former slightly\nasymptotically slower, one can make the latter significantly asymptotically\nfaster (even allowing for operations with sub-constant amortized I/Os). This\nasymmetry makes it so that rotation-based search trees are not optimal (or even\nclose to optimal) in insert/update/delete-heavy external-memory workloads. To\nstudy dynamic optimality for such workloads, one must consider a different\nclass of data structures.\nThe natural class of data structures to consider are what we call\nbuffered-propagation trees. Such trees can adapt dynamically to the locality\nproperties of an input sequence in order to optimize the interactions between\ndifferent inserts/updates/deletes and queries. We also present a new form of\nbeyond-worst-case analysis that allows for us to formally study a continuum\nbetween static and dynamic optimality. Finally, we give a novel data structure,\ncalled the \\jellotree, that is statically optimal and that achieves dynamic\noptimality for a large natural class of inputs defined by our beyond-worst-case\nanalysis.",

However, as a non-contact proximity sensing scheme\nis easily affected by the disturbance of peripheral objects or surroundings, it\nrequires considerable sensitive data processing than contact sensing, limiting\nthe use of its further utilization. In this paper, we propose a real-time\ninterface control framework based on non-contact hand motion gesture\nrecognition through processing the raw signals, detecting the electric field\ndisturbance triggered by the hand gesture movements near the capacitive sensor\nusing adaptive threshold, and extracting the significant signal frame, covering\nthe authentic signal intervals with 98.8% detection rate and 98.4% frame\ncorrection rate.

    "title": "Augmenting astrophysical scaling relations with machine learning :  application to reducing the SZ flux-mass scatter",
    "abstract": "Complex systems (stars, supernovae, galaxies, and clusters) often exhibit low\nscatter relations between observable properties (e.g., luminosity, velocity\ndispersion, oscillation period, temperature). These scaling relations can\nilluminate the underlying physics and can provide observational tools for\nestimating masses and distances. Machine learning can provide a systematic way\nto search for new scaling relations (or for simple extensions to existing\nrelations) in abstract high-dimensional parameter spaces. We use a machine\nlearning tool called symbolic regression (SR), which models the patterns in a\ngiven dataset in the form of analytic equations. We focus on the\nSunyaev-Zeldovich flux$-$cluster mass relation ($Y_\\mathrm{SZ}-M$), the scatter\nin which affects inference of cosmological parameters from cluster abundance\ndata. Using SR on the data from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, we\nfind a new proxy for cluster mass which combines $Y_\\mathrm{SZ}$ and\nconcentration of ionized gas ($c_\\mathrm{gas}$): $M \\propto\nY_\\mathrm{conc}^{3/5} \\equiv Y_\\mathrm{SZ}^{3/5} (1-A\\, c_\\mathrm{gas})$.\n$Y_\\mathrm{conc}$ reduces the scatter in the predicted $M$ by $\\sim 20-30$% for\nlarge clusters ($M\\gtrsim 10^{14}\\, h^{-1} \\, M_\\odot$) at both high and low\nredshifts, as compared to using just $Y_\\mathrm{SZ}$. We show that the\ndependence on $c_\\mathrm{gas}$ is linked to cores of clusters exhibiting larger\nscatter than their outskirts. Finally, we test $Y_\\mathrm{conc}$ on clusters\nfrom simulations of the CAMELS project and show that $Y_\\mathrm{conc}$ is\nrobust against variations in cosmology, astrophysics, subgrid physics, and\ncosmic variance. Our results and methodology can be useful for accurate\nmultiwavelength cluster mass estimation from current and upcoming CMB and X-ray\nsurveys like ACT, SO, SPT, eROSITA and CMB-S4.",

The approach consists of selecting the physical\nmodels based on their agreement with coronal holes extracted from the images.\nUltimately, the goal is to use physical models to predict geomagnetic storms.\nWe decompose the problem into three subproblems: (i) coronal hole segmentation\nbased on physical constraints, (ii) matching clusters of coronal holes between\ndifferent maps, and (iii) physical map classification. For segmenting coronal\nholes, we develop a multi-modal method that uses segmentation maps from three\ndifferent methods to initialize a level-set method that evolves the initial\ncoronal hole segmentation to the magnetic boundary. Then, we introduce a new\nmethod based on Linear Programming for matching clusters of coronal holes. The\nfinal matching is then performed using Random Forests. The methods were\ncarefully validated using consensus maps derived from multiple readers, manual\nclustering, manual map classification, and method validation for 50 maps. The\nproposed multi-modal segmentation method significantly outperformed SegNet,\nU-net, Henney-Harvey, and FCN by providing accurate boundary detection.\nOverall, the method gave a 95.5% map classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The difficulties in both data acquisition and annotation substantially\nrestrict the sample sizes of training datasets for 3D medical imaging\napplications. As a result, constructing high-performance 3D convolutional\nneural networks from scratch remains a difficult task in the absence of a\nsufficient pre-training parameter. Previous efforts on 3D pre-training have\nfrequently relied on self-supervised approaches, which use either predictive or\ncontrastive learning on unlabeled data to build invariant 3D representations.\nHowever, because of the unavailability of large-scale supervision information,\nobtaining semantically invariant and discriminative representations from these\nlearning frameworks remains problematic. In this paper, we revisit an\ninnovative yet simple fully-supervised 3D network pre-training framework to\ntake advantage of semantic supervisions from large-scale 2D natural image\ndatasets. With a redesigned 3D network architecture, reformulated natural\nimages are used to address the problem of data scarcity and develop powerful 3D\nrepresentations. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed pre-trained models can effectively accelerate\nconvergence while also improving accuracy for a variety of 3D medical imaging\ntasks such as classification, segmentation and detection. In addition, as\ncompared to training from scratch, it can save up to 60% of annotation efforts.\nOn the NIH DeepLesion dataset, it likewise achieves state-of-the-art detection\nperformance, outperforming earlier self-supervised and fully-supervised\npre-training approaches, as well as methods that do training from scratch.

    "abstract": "When there are significant service disruptions in public transit systems,\npassengers usually need guidance to find alternative paths. This paper proposes\na path recommendation model to mitigate the congestion during public transit\ndisruptions. Passengers with different origin-destination and departure times\nare recommended with different paths such that the system travel time is\nminimized. We model the path recommendation as an optimal flow problem with\nuncertain demand information. To tackle the non-analytical formulation of\ntravel times due to left behind, we propose a simulation-based first-order\napproximation to transform the original problem into linear programming.\nUncertainties in demand are modeled with robust optimization to protect the\npath recommendation strategies against inaccurate estimates. A real-world rail\ndisruption scenario in the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) system is used as a\ncase study. Results show that even without considering uncertainty, the nominal\nmodel can reduce the system travel time by 9.1% (compared to the status quo),\nand outperforms the benchmark capacity-based path recommendation. The average\ntravel time of passengers in the incident line (i.e., passengers receiving\nrecommendations) is reduced more (-20.6% compared to the status quo). After\nincorporating the demand uncertainty, the robust model can further reduce the\nsystem travel time. The best robust model can decrease the average travel time\nof incident-line passengers by 2.91% compared to the nominal model.",

Kernel methods address the challenge by incorporating image prior\ninformation in the forward model of iterative PET image reconstruction. The\nkernelized expectation-maximization (KEM) algorithm has been developed and\ndemonstrated to be effective and easy to implement. A common approach for a\nfurther improvement of the kernel method would be adding an explicit\nregularization, which however leads to a complex optimization problem. In this\npaper, we propose an implicit regularization for the kernel method by using a\ndeep coefficient prior, which represents the kernel coefficient image in the\nPET forward model using a convolutional neural-network. To solve the\nmaximum-likelihood neural network-based reconstruction problem, we apply the\nprinciple of optimization transfer to derive a neural KEM algorithm. Each\niteration of the algorithm consists of two separate steps: a KEM step for image\nupdate from the projection data and a deep-learning step in the image domain\nfor updating the kernel coefficient image using the neural network. This\noptimization algorithm is guaranteed to monotonically increase the data\nlikelihood.

However, fast and reliable\nlocalization of small-scale regions-of-interest (ROI) has remained a key\nchallenge, as discriminative morphologic features often occupy only a small\nfraction of a gigapixel-scale whole-slide image (WSI). In this paper, we\npropose a sparse WSI analysis method for the rapid identification of high-power\nROI for WSI-level classification. We develop an evaluation framework inspired\nby the early classification literature, in order to quantify the tradeoff\nbetween diagnostic performance and inference time for sparse analytic\napproaches. We test our method on a common but time-consuming task in pathology\n- that of diagnosing gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) on hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E)-stained slides from endoscopic biopsy specimens. GIM is a\nwell-known precursor lesion along the pathway to development of gastric cancer.\nWe performed a thorough evaluation of the performance and inference time of our\napproach on a test set of GIM-positive and GIM-negative WSI, finding that our\nmethod successfully detects GIM in all positive WSI, with a WSI-level\nclassification area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of\n0.98 and an average precision (AP) of 0.95. Furthermore, we show that our\nmethod can attain these metrics in under one minute on a standard CPU.

In\nparticular, we propose to leverage the temporal correlation in device activity,\ne.g., a device active in the previous coherence block is more likely to be\nstill active in the current coherence block, to improve the detection and\nestimation performance. However, it is challenging to utilize this temporal\ncorrelation as side information (SI), which relies on the knowledge about the\nexact statistical relation between the estimated activity pattern for the\nprevious coherence block (which may be imperfect with unknown error) and the\ntrue activity pattern in the current coherence block. To tackle this challenge,\nwe establish a novel SI-aided multiple measurement vector approximate message\npassing (MMV-AMP) framework. Specifically, thanks to the state evolution of the\nMMV-AMP algorithm, the correlation between the activity pattern estimated by\nthe MMV-AMP algorithm in the previous coherence block and the real activity\npattern in the current coherence block is quantified explicitly. Based on the\nwell-defined temporal correlation, we further manage to embed this useful SI\ninto the denoiser design under the MMV-AMP framework.

    "abstract": "Video quality assessment (VQA) remains an important and challenging problem\nthat affects many applications at the widest scales. Recent advances in mobile\ndevices and cloud computing techniques have made it possible to capture,\nprocess, and share high resolution, high frame rate (HFR) videos across the\nInternet nearly instantaneously. Being able to monitor and control the quality\nof these streamed videos can enable the delivery of more enjoyable content and\nperceptually optimized rate control. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to\ndevelop VQA models that can be deployed at enormous scales. While some recent\neffects have been applied to full-reference (FR) analysis of variable frame\nrate and HFR video quality, the development of no-reference (NR) VQA algorithms\ntargeting frame rate variations has been little studied. Here, we propose a\nfirst-of-a-kind blind VQA model for evaluating HFR videos, which we dub the\nFramerate-Aware Video Evaluator w/o Reference (FAVER). FAVER uses extended\nmodels of spatial natural scene statistics that encompass space-time\nwavelet-decomposed video signals, to conduct efficient frame rate sensitive\nquality prediction. Our extensive experiments on several HFR video quality\ndatasets show that FAVER outperforms other blind VQA algorithms at a reasonable\ncomputational cost.

    "title": "Interference Aware Cooperative Routing for Edge Computing-enabled 5G  Networks",
    "abstract": "Recently, there has been growing research on developing interference-aware\nrouting (IAR) protocols for supporting multiple concurrent transmission in\nnext-generation wireless communication systems. The existing IAR protocols do\nnot consider node cooperation while establishing the routes because motivating\nthe nodes to cooperate and modeling that cooperation is not a trivial task. In\naddition, the information about the cooperative behavior of a node is not\ndirectly visible to neighboring nodes. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a\nnew routing method in which the nodes' cooperation information is utilized to\nimprove the performance of edge computing-enabled 5G networks. The proposed\nmetric is a function of created and received interference in the network. The\nreceived interference term ensures that the Signal to Interference plus Noise\nRatio (SINR) at the route remains above the threshold value, while the created\ninterference term ensures that those nodes are selected to forward the packet\nthat creates low interference for other nodes. The results show that the\nproposed solution improves ad hoc networks' performance compared to\nconventional routing protocols in terms of high network throughput and low\noutage probability.",

Using the DP approach,\nsix formant estimation methods were first compared.

QCP-FB gave the\nbest performance in the comparison. Therefore, a novel formant tracking\napproach, which combines benefits of deep learning and signal processing based\non QCP-FB, was proposed. In this approach, the formants predicted by a\nDNN-based tracker from a speech frame are refined using the peaks of the\nall-pole spectrum computed by QCP-FB from the same frame. Results show that the\nproposed DNN-based tracker performed better both in detection rate and\nestimation error for the lowest three formants compared to reference formant\ntrackers.

We derive I-EKF with and without an unknown input by considering\nnonlinearity in both forward and inverse state-space models. In the process,\nI-KF-with-unknown-input is also obtained. We then provide theoretical stability\nguarantees using both bounded nonlinearity and unknown matrix approaches.

    "abstract": "Compact stellar systems such as Ultra-compact dwarfs (UCDs) and Globular\nClusters (GCs) around galaxies are known to be the tracers of the merger events\nthat have been forming these galaxies. Therefore, identifying such systems\nallows to study galaxies mass assembly, formation and evolution. However, in\nthe lack of spectroscopic information detecting UCDs/GCs using imaging data is\nvery uncertain. Here, we aim to train a machine learning model to separate\nthese objects from the foreground stars and background galaxies using the\nmulti-wavelength imaging data of the Fornax galaxy cluster in 6 filters, namely\nu, g, r, i, J and Ks. The classes of objects are highly imbalanced which is\nproblematic for many automatic classification techniques. Hence, we employ\nSynthetic Minority Over-sampling to handle the imbalance of the training data.\nThen, we compare two classifiers, namely Localized Generalized Matrix Learning\nVector Quantization (LGMLVQ) and Random Forest (RF). Both methods are able to\nidentify UCDs/GCs with a precision and a recall of >93 percent and provide\nrelevances that reflect the importance of each feature dimension %(colors and\nangular sizes) for the classification. Both methods detect angular sizes as\nimportant markers for this classification problem. While it is astronomical\nexpectation that color indices of u-i and i-Ks are the most important colors,\nour analysis shows that colors such as g-r are more informative, potentially\nbecause of higher signal-to-noise ratio. Besides the excellent performance the\nLGMLVQ method allows further interpretability by providing the feature\nimportance for each individual class, class-wise representative samples and the\npossibility for non-linear visualization of the data as demonstrated in this\ncontribution. We conclude that employing machine learning techniques to\nidentify UCDs/GCs can lead to promising results.",

In this paper, we\nintroduce stochastic block majorization-minimization, where the surrogates can\nnow be only block multi-convex and a single block is optimized at a time within\na diminishing radius. Relaxing the standard strong convexity requirements for\nsurrogates in SMM, our framework gives wider applicability including online\nCANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) dictionary learning and yields greater computational\nefficiency especially when the problem dimension is large. We provide an\nextensive convergence analysis on the proposed algorithm, which we derive under\npossibly dependent data streams, relaxing the standard i.i.d. assumption on\ndata samples.

    "abstract": "A common approach to solving tasks, such as node classification or link\nprediction, on a large network begins by learning a Euclidean embedding of the\nnodes of the network, from which regular machine learning methods can be\napplied. For unsupervised random walk methods such as DeepWalk and node2vec,\nadding a $\\ell_2$ penalty on the embedding vectors to the loss leads to\nimproved downstream task performance. In this paper we study the effects of\nthis regularization and prove that, under exchangeability assumptions on the\ngraph, it asymptotically leads to learning a nuclear-norm-type penalized\ngraphon. In particular, the exact form of the penalty depends on the choice of\nsubsampling method used within stochastic gradient descent to learn the\nembeddings. We also illustrate empirically that concatenating node covariates\nto $\\ell_2$ regularized node2vec embeddings leads to comparable, if not\nsuperior, performance to methods which incorporate node covariates and the\nnetwork structure in a non-linear manner.",

    "title": "Limits on Parameter Estimation of Quantum Channels",
    "abstract": "The aim of this thesis is to develop a theoretical framework to study\nparameter estimation of quantum channels. We study the task of estimating\nunknown parameters encoded in a channel in the sequential setting. A sequential\nstrategy is the most general way to use a channel multiple times. Our goal is\nto establish lower bounds (called Cramer-Rao bounds) on the estimation error.\nThe bounds we develop are universally applicable; i.e., they apply to all\npermissible quantum dynamics. We consider the use of catalysts to enhance the\npower of a channel estimation strategy. This is termed amortization. The power\nof a channel for a parameter estimation is determined by its Fisher\ninformation. Thus, we study how much a catalyst quantum state can enhance the\nFisher information of a channel by defining the amortized Fisher information.\nWe establish our bounds by proving that for certain Fisher information\nquantities, catalyst states do not improve the performance of a sequential\nestimation protocol compared to a parallel one. The technical term for this is\nan amortization collapse. We use this to establish bounds when estimating one\nparameter, or multiple parameters simultaneously. Our bounds apply universally\nand we also cast them as optimization problems. For the single parameter case,\nwe establish bounds for general quantum channels using both the symmetric\nlogarithmic derivative (SLD) Fisher information and the right logarithmic\nderivative (RLD) Fisher information. The task of estimating multiple parameters\nsimultaneously is more involved than the single parameter case, because the\nCramer-Rao bounds take the form of matrix inequalities. We establish a scalar\nCramer-Rao bound for multiparameter channel estimation using the RLD Fisher\ninformation. For both single and multiparameter estimation, we provide a no-go\ncondition for the so-called Heisenberg scaling using our RLD-based bound.",
