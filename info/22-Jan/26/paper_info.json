    "title": "A System for Image Understanding using Sensemaking and Narrative",
    "abstract": "Sensemaking and narrative are two inherently interconnected concepts about\nhow people understand the world around them. Sensemaking is the process by\nwhich people structure and interconnect the information they encounter in the\nworld with the knowledge and inferences they have made in the past. Narratives\nare important constructs that people use sensemaking to create; ones that\nreflect provide a more holistic account of the world than the information\nwithin any given narrative is able to alone. Both are important to how human\nbeings parse the world, and both would be valuable for a computational system\nattempting to do the same. In this paper, we discuss theories of sensemaking\nand narrative with respect to how people build an understanding of the world\nbased on the information they encounter, as well as the links between the\nfields of sensemaking and narrative research. We highlight a specific\ncomputational task, visual storytelling, whose solutions we believe can be\nenhanced by employing a sensemaking and narrative component. We then describe\nour system for visual storytelling using sensemaking and narrative and discuss\nexamples from its current implementation.",

    "abstract": "Deploying complex deep learning models on edge devices is challenging because\nthey have substantial compute and memory resource requirements, whereas edge\ndevices' resource budget is limited. To solve this problem, extensive pruning\ntechniques have been proposed for compressing networks. Recent advances based\non the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) show that iterative model pruning tends\nto produce smaller and more accurate models. However, LTH research focuses on\nunstructured pruning, which is hardware-inefficient and difficult to accelerate\non hardware platforms.\nIn this paper, we investigate iterative pruning in the context of structured\npruning because structurally pruned models map well on commodity hardware. We\nfind that directly applying a structured weight-based pruning technique\niteratively, called iterative L1-norm based pruning (ILP), does not produce\naccurate pruned models. To solve this problem, we propose two activation-based\npruning methods, Iterative Activation-based Pruning (IAP) and Adaptive\nIterative Activation-based Pruning (AIAP). We observe that, with only 1%\naccuracy loss, IAP and AIAP achieve 7.75X and 15.88$X compression on LeNet-5,\nand 1.25X and 1.71X compression on ResNet-50, whereas ILP achieves 4.77X and\n1.13X, respectively.",

Although issues, such as privacy, have gained significant\nattention in this domain, not much attention has been given to satisfying\nstatistical fairness measures in the FL setting. With this goal in mind, we\nconduct studies to show that FL is able to satisfy different fairness metrics\nunder different data regimes consisting of different types of clients. More\nspecifically, uncooperative or adversarial clients might contaminate the global\nFL model by injecting biased or poisoned models due to existing biases in their\ntraining datasets. Those biases might be a result of imbalanced training set\n(Zhang and Zhou 2019), historical biases (Mehrabi et al. 2021a), or poisoned\ndata-points from data poisoning attacks against fairness (Mehrabi et al. 2021b;\nSolans, Biggio, and Castillo 2020).

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition in smart eyewear devices is highly valuable but\nchallenging. One key limitation of previous works is that the\nexpression-related information like facial or eye images is considered as the\nonly emotional evidence. However, emotional status is not isolated; it is\ntightly associated with people's visual perceptions, especially those\nsentimental ones. However, little work has examined such associations to better\nillustrate the cause of different emotions. In this paper, we study the\nemotionship analysis problem in eyewear systems, an ambitious task that\nrequires not only classifying the user's emotions but also semantically\nunderstanding the potential cause of such emotions. To this end, we devise\nEMOShip, a deep-learning-based eyewear system that can automatically detect the\nwearer's emotional status and simultaneously analyze its associations with\nsemantic-level visual perceptions. Experimental studies with 20 participants\ndemonstrate that, thanks to the emotionship awareness, EMOShip not only\nachieves superior emotion recognition accuracy over existing methods (80.2% vs.\n69.4%), but also provides a valuable understanding of the cause of emotions.\nPilot studies with 20 participants further motivate the potential use of\nEMOShip to empower emotion-aware applications, such as emotionship\nself-reflection and emotionship life-logging.",

Recent attacks on processors have shown the fatal\nconsequences of uncovering and exploiting hardware vulnerabilities.\nFuzzing has emerged as a promising technique for detecting software\nvulnerabilities. Recently, a few hardware fuzzing techniques have been\nproposed. However, they suffer from several limitations, including\nnon-applicability to commonly used Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) like\nVerilog and VHDL, the need for significant human intervention, and inability to\ncapture many intrinsic hardware behaviors, such as signal transitions and\nfloating wires.\nIn this paper, we present the design and implementation of a novel hardware\nfuzzer, TheHuzz, that overcomes the aforementioned limitations and\nsignificantly improves the state of the art. We analyze the intrinsic behaviors\nof hardware designs in HDLs and then measure the coverage metrics that model\nsuch behaviors. TheHuzz generates assembly-level instructions to increase the\ndesired coverage values, thereby finding many hardware bugs that are\nexploitable from software. We evaluate TheHuzz on four popular open-source\nprocessors and achieve 1.98x and 3.33x the speed compared to the\nindustry-standard random regression approach and the state-of-the-art hardware\nfuzzer, DiffuzRTL, respectively.

    "abstract": "Architectural Education faces limitations due to its tactile approach to\nlearning in classrooms with only 2-D and 3-D tools. At a higher level, virtual\nreality provides a potential for delivering more information to individuals\nundergoing design learning. This paper investigates a hypothesis establishing\ngrounds towards a new research in Building Information Modeling (BIM) and\nVirtual Reality (VR). The hypothesis is projected to determine best practices\nfor content creation and tactile object virtual interaction, which potentially\ncan improve learning in architectural & construction education with a less\ncostly approach and ease of access to well-known buildings. We explored this\nhypothesis in a step-by-step game design demonstration in VR, by showcasing the\nexploration of the Farnsworth House and reproducing assemblage of the same with\ndifferent game levels of difficulty which correspond with varying BIM levels of\ndevelopment (LODs). The game design prototype equally provides an entry way and\nlearning style for users with or without a formal architectural or construction\neducation seeking to understand design tectonics within diverse or\ncross-disciplinary study cases. This paper shows that developing geometric\nabstract concepts of design pedagogy, using varying LODs for game content and\nlevels, while utilizing newly developed features such as snap-to-grid,\nsnap-to-position and snap-to-angle to improve user engagement during assemblage\nmay provide deeper learning objectives for architectural precedent study.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of binary string reconstruction from the multiset of\nits substring compositions, i.e., referred to as the substring composition\nmultiset, first introduced and studied by Acharya et al. We introduce a new\nalgorithm for the problem of string reconstruction from its substring\ncomposition multiset which relies on the algebraic properties of the equivalent\nbivariate polynomial formulation of the problem. We then characterize specific\nalgebraic conditions for the binary string to be reconstructed that guarantee\nthe algorithm does not require any backtracking through the reconstruction,\nand, consequently, the time complexity is bounded polynomially. More\nspecifically, in the case of no backtracking, our algorithm has a time\ncomplexity of $O(n^2)$ compared to the algorithm by Acharya et al., which has a\ntime complexity of $O(n^2\\log(n))$, where $n$ is the length of the binary\nstring. Furthermore, it is shown that larger sets of binary strings are\nuniquely reconstructable by the new algorithm and without the need for\nbacktracking leading to codebooks of reconstruction codes that are larger, by a\nlinear factor in size, compared to the previously known construction by\nPattabiraman et al., while having $O(n^2)$ reconstruction complexity.",

It is used to track users or as an additional\nmeans of identification to improve security. In this paper, we report on a new\ntechnique that can significantly extend the tracking time of fingerprint-based\ntracking methods. Our technique, which we call DrawnApart, is a new GPU\nfingerprinting technique that identifies a device based on the unique\nproperties of its GPU stack. Specifically, we show that variations in speed\namong the multiple execution units that comprise a GPU can serve as a reliable\nand robust device signature, which can be collected using unprivileged\nJavaScript. We investigate the accuracy of DrawnApart under two scenarios. In\nthe first scenario, our controlled experiments confirm that the technique is\neffective in distinguishing devices with similar hardware and software\nconfigurations, even when they are considered identical by current\nstate-of-the-art fingerprinting algorithms. In the second scenario, we\nintegrate a one-shot learning version of our technique into a state-of-the-art\nbrowser fingerprint tracking algorithm. We verify our technique through a\nlarge-scale experiment involving data collected from over 2,500 crowd-sourced\ndevices over a period of several months and show it provides a boost of up to\n67% to the median tracking duration, compared to the state-of-the-art method.\nDrawnApart makes two contributions to the state of the art in browser\nfingerprinting. On the conceptual front, it is the first work that explores the\nmanufacturing differences between identical GPUs and the first to exploit these\ndifferences in a privacy context.

Prior work dealt with\ndata distributed by examples, horizontal partitioning, but we lack a\ncounterpart for data scattered by features, an increasingly common scheme (e.g.\nuser profiling with data from multiple entities). To fill this gap, we provide\nan EM-based algorithm to fit Gaussian mixtures to Vertically Partitioned data\n(VP-EM). In federated learning setups, our algorithm matches the centralized EM\nfitting of Gaussian mixtures constrained to a subspace. In arbitrary\ncommunication graphs, consensus averaging allows VP-EM to run on large\npeer-to-peer networks as an EM approximation. This mismatch comes from\nconsensus error only, which vanishes exponentially fast with the number of\nconsensus rounds. We demonstrate VP-EM on various topologies for both synthetic\nand real data, evaluating its approximation of centralized EM and seeing that\nit outperforms the available benchmark.",

    "title": "Attacks and Defenses for Free-Riders in Multi-Discriminator GAN",
    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are increasingly adopted by the\nindustry to synthesize realistic images. Due to data not being centrally\navailable, Multi-Discriminator (MD)-GANs training framework employs multiple\ndiscriminators that have direct access to the real data. Distributedly training\na joint GAN model entails the risk of free-riders, i.e., participants that aim\nto benefit from the common model while only pretending to participate in the\ntraining process. In this paper, we conduct the first characterization study of\nthe impact of free-riders on MD-GAN. Based on two production prototypes of\nMD-GAN, we find that free-riders drastically reduce the ability of MD-GANs to\nproduce images that are indistinguishable from real data, i.e., they increase\nthe FID score -- the standard measure to assess the quality of generated\nimages. To mitigate the model degradation, we propose a defense strategy\nagainst free-riders in MD-GAN, termed DFG. DFG distinguishes free-riders and\nbenign participants through periodic probing and clustering of discriminators'\nresponses based on a reference response of free-riders, which then allows the\ngenerator to exclude the detected free-riders from the training. Furthermore,\nwe extend our defense, termed DFG+, to enable discriminators to filter out\nfree-riders at the variant of MD-GAN that allows peer exchanges of\ndiscriminators networks. Extensive evaluation on various scenarios of\nfree-riders, MD-GAN architecture, and three datasets show that our defenses\neffectively detect free-riders. With 1 to 5 free-riders, DFG and DFG+ averagely\ndecreases FID by 5.22% to 11.53% for CIFAR10 and 5.79% to 13.22% for CIFAR100\nin comparison to an attack without defense. In a shell, the proposed DFG(+) can\neffectively defend against free-riders without affecting benign clients at a\nnegligible computation overhead.",

To this end, we invoke the replica\nmethod to derive the asymptotic normalized cross entropy in an inverse\nprobability problem whose generative model is described by a Gaussian random\nfield with a generic covariance function. Our derivations further demonstrate\nthe asymptotic statistical decoupling of Bayesian inference algorithms and\nspecify the decoupled setting for a given nonlinear model.\nThe replica solution depicts that strictly nonlinear models establish an\nall-or-nothing phase transition: There exists a critical load at which the\noptimal Bayesian inference changes from being perfect to an uncorrelated\nlearning. This finding leads to design of a new secure coding scheme which\nachieves the secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel.

The agent can service a task with a normal or high fidelity\nlevel, where fidelity refers to the degree of exactness and precision while\nservicing the task. Therefore, high fidelity servicing results in\nhigher-quality service but leads to larger service times and increased operator\ntiredness. We treat the cognitive state of the human operator as a lumped\nparameter that captures psychological factors such as workload and fatigue. The\nservice time distribution of the human operator depends on her cognitive\ndynamics and the fidelity level selected for servicing the task. Her cognitive\ndynamics evolve as a Markov chain in which the cognitive state increases with\nhigh probability whenever she is busy and decreases while resting.

    "abstract": "Given a union of non-linear manifolds, non-linear subspace clustering or\nmanifold clustering aims to cluster data points based on manifold structures\nand also learn to parameterize each manifold as a linear subspace in a feature\nspace. Deep neural networks have the potential to achieve this goal under\nhighly non-linear settings given their large capacity and flexibility. We argue\nthat achieving manifold clustering with neural networks requires two essential\ningredients: a domain-specific constraint that ensures the identification of\nthe manifolds, and a learning algorithm for embedding each manifold to a linear\nsubspace in the feature space. This work shows that many constraints can be\nimplemented by data augmentation. For subspace feature learning, Maximum Coding\nRate Reduction (MCR$^2$) objective can be used. Putting them together yields\n{\\em Neural Manifold Clustering and Embedding} (NMCE), a novel method for\ngeneral purpose manifold clustering, which significantly outperforms\nautoencoder-based deep subspace clustering. Further, on more challenging\nnatural image datasets, NMCE can also outperform other algorithms specifically\ndesigned for clustering. Qualitatively, we demonstrate that NMCE learns a\nmeaningful and interpretable feature space.

While this\napproach attempts to address the problem that the source and the target data\nare from different distributions, it fails to recognize the possibility that,\nwithin the target domain, some samples are closer to the distribution of the\nsource domain than the distribution of the target domain. In this paper, we\ndevelop a novel DA algorithm, the Enforced Transfer, that deals with this\nsituation. A straightforward but effective idea to deal with this dilemma is to\nuse an out-of-distribution detection algorithm to decide if, during the testing\nphase, a given sample is closer to the distribution of the source domain, the\ntarget domain, or neither. In the first case, this sample is given to a machine\nlearning classifier trained on source samples.

When the optimization\nalgorithm iteratively evaluates different loading cases, the traditional\nnumerical simulation methods used usually lead to a substantial computational\ncost.

Choosing\nthe steady heat conduction problems as examples, this paper proposes a\nPhysics-driven Convolutional Neural Networks (PD-CNN) method to infer the\nphysical field solutions for random varied loading cases. After that, the\nParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize the sizes and\nthe positions of the hole masks in the prescribed design domain, and the\naverage temperature value of the entire heat conduction field is minimized, and\nthe goal of minimizing heat transfer is achieved.

    "abstract": "Simulating stiff materials in applications where deformations are either not\nsignificant or can safely be ignored is a pivotal task across fields. Rigid\nbody modeling has thus long remained a fundamental tool and is, by far, the\nmost popular simulation strategy currently employed for modeling stiff solids.\nAt the same time, numerical models of a rigid body continue to pose a number of\nknown challenges and trade-offs including intersections, instabilities,\ninaccuracies, and/or slow performances that grow with contact-problem\ncomplexity. In this paper we revisit this problem and present ABD, a simple and\nhighly effective affine body dynamics framework, which significantly improves\nstate-of-the-art stiff simulations. We trace the challenges in the rigid-body\nIPC (incremental potential contact) method to the necessity of linearizing\npiecewise-rigid (SE(3)) trajectories and subsequent constraints. ABD instead\nrelaxes the unnecessary (and unrealistic) constraint that each body's motion be\nexactly rigid with a stiff orthogonality potential, while preserving the rigid\nbody model's key feature of a small coordinate representation. In doing so ABD\nreplaces piecewise linearization with piecewise linear trajectories. This, in\nturn, combines the best from both parties: compact coordinates ensure small,\nsparse system solves, while piecewise-linear trajectories enable efficient and\naccurate constraint (contact and joint) evaluations. Beginning with this simple\nfoundation, ABD preserves all guarantees of the underlying IPC model e.g.,\nsolution convergence, guaranteed non-intersection, and accurate frictional\ncontact. Over a wide range and scale of simulation problems we demonstrate that\nABD brings orders of magnitude performance gains (two- to three-order on the\nCPU and an order more utilizing the GPU, which is 10,000x speedups) over prior\nIPC-based methods with a similar or higher simulation quality.",

However, guaranteeing ultra-reliable and\nlow-latency MEC (URLL MEC) is very challenging due to uncertainties of wireless\nlinks, limited communications and computing resources, as well as dynamic\nnetwork traffic. Enabling URLL MEC mandates taking into account the statistics\nof the end-to-end (E2E) latency and reliability across the wireless and edge\ncomputing systems. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to optimize the\nreliability of MEC networks by considering the distribution of E2E service\ndelay, encompassing over-the-air transmission and edge computing latency. The\nproposed framework builds on correlated variational autoencoders (VAEs) to\nestimate the full distribution of the E2E service delay. Using this result, a\nnew optimization problem based on risk theory is formulated to maximize the\nnetwork reliability by minimizing the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as a\nrisk measure of the E2E service delay. To solve this problem, a new algorithm\nis developed to efficiently allocate users' processing tasks to edge computing\nservers across the MEC network, while considering the statistics of the E2E\nservice delay learned by VAEs. The simulation results show that the proposed\nscheme outperforms several baselines that do not account for the risk analyses\nor statistics of the E2E service delay.",

In addition to helping build new solar and wind\nfarms, companies make power purchase agreements or purchase carbon offsets,\nrather than relying on renewable energy every hour of the day, every day of the\nweek (24/7). Relying on renewable energy 24/7 is challenging due to the\nintermittent nature of wind and solar energy.

    "abstract": "Targeted training-set attacks inject malicious instances into the training\nset to cause a trained model to mislabel one or more specific test instances.\nThis work proposes the task of target identification, which determines whether\na specific test instance is the target of a training-set attack. This can then\nbe combined with adversarial-instance identification to find (and remove) the\nattack instances, mitigating the attack with minimal impact on other\npredictions. Rather than focusing on a single attack method or data modality,\nwe build on influence estimation, which quantifies each training instance's\ncontribution to a model's prediction. We show that existing influence\nestimators' poor practical performance often derives from their over-reliance\non instances and iterations with large losses. Our renormalized influence\nestimators fix this weakness; they far outperform the original ones at\nidentifying influential groups of training examples in both adversarial and\nnon-adversarial settings, even finding up to 100% of adversarial training\ninstances with no clean-data false positives. Target identification then\nsimplifies to detecting test instances with anomalous influence values.

    "abstract": "It has been known that the insufficiency of linear coding in achieving the\noptimal rate of the general index coding problem is rooted in its rate's\ndependency on the field size. However, this dependency has been described only\nthrough the two well-known matroid instances, namely the Fano and non-Fano\nmatroids, which, in turn, limits its scope only to the fields with\ncharacteristic two. In this paper, we extend this scope to demonstrate the\nreliance of linear coding rate on fields with characteristic three. By\nconstructing two index coding instances of size 29, we prove that for the first\ninstance, linear coding is optimal only over the fields with characteristic\nthree, and for the second instance, linear coding over any field with\ncharacteristic three can never be optimal. Then, a variation of the second\ninstance is designed as the third index coding instance of size 58, for which,\nit is proved that while linear coding over any fields with characteristic three\ncannot be optimal, there exists a nonlinear code over the fields with\ncharacteristic three, which achieves its optimal rate. Connecting the first and\nthird index coding instances in two specific ways, called no-way and two-way\nconnections, will lead to two new index coding instances of size 87 and 91 for\nwhich linear coding is outperformed by nonlinear codes. Another main\ncontribution of this paper is to reduce the key constraints on the space of the\nlinear coding for the the first and second index coding instances, each of size\n29, into a matroid instance with the ground set of size 9, whose linear\nrepresentability is dependent on the fields with characteristic three. The\nproofs and discussions provided in this paper through using these two\nrelatively small matroid instances will shed light on the underlying reason\ncausing the linear coding to become insufficient for the general index coding\nproblem.",

DL models are, however, mainly\ndesigned to be applied on sparse sEMG signals. Furthermore, due to their\ncomplex structure, typically, we are faced with memory constraints; require\nlarge training times and a large number of training samples, and; there is the\nneed to resort to data augmentation and/or transfer learning. In this paper,\nfor the first time (to the best of our knowledge), we investigate and design a\nVision Transformer (ViT) based architecture to perform hand gesture recognition\nfrom High Density (HD-sEMG) signals. Intuitively speaking, we capitalize on the\nrecent breakthrough role of the transformer architecture in tackling different\ncomplex problems together with its potential for employing more input\nparallelization via its attention mechanism. The proposed Vision\nTransformer-based Hand Gesture Recognition (ViT-HGR) framework can overcome the\naforementioned training time problems and can accurately classify a large\nnumber of hand gestures from scratch without any need for data augmentation\nand/or transfer learning. The efficiency of the proposed ViT-HGR framework is\nevaluated using a recently-released HD-sEMG dataset consisting of 65 isometric\nhand gestures. Our experiments with 64-sample (31.25 ms) window size yield\naverage test accuracy of 84.62 +/- 3.07%, where only 78, 210 number of\nparameters is utilized.

Then, we show that the\neigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix sequences are clustered around $\\pm\n1$, which entails rapid convergence, when the minimal residual method is\ndevised. Alternatively, when the conjugate gradient method on normal equations\nis used, we show that our preconditioner is effective in the sense that the\neigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix sequence are clustered around the\nunity. An extension of our proposed preconditioned method is given for\nhigh-order backward difference time discretization schemes, which applies on a\nwide range of time-dependent equations.

Despite their wide application, the success of traditional link\nprediction algorithms is hindered by three major challenges -- link sparsity,\nnode attribute noise and network dynamics -- that are faced by real-world\nnetworks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Contextualized\nSelf-Supervised Learning (CSSL) framework that fully exploits structural\ncontext prediction for link prediction. The proposed CSSL framework forms edge\nembeddings through aggregating pairs of node embeddings constructed via a\ntransformation on node attributes, which are used to predict the link existence\nprobability. To generate node embeddings tailored for link prediction,\nstructural context prediction is leveraged as a self-supervised learning task\nto boost link prediction. Two types of structural contexts are investigated,\ni.e., context nodes collected from random walks vs. context subgraphs. The CSSL\nframework can be trained in an end-to-end manner, with the learning of node and\nedge embeddings supervised by link prediction and the self-supervised learning\ntask. The proposed CSSL is a generic and flexible framework in the sense that\nit can handle both transductive and inductive link prediction settings, and\nboth attributed and non-attributed networks. Extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies on seven real-world benchmark graph datasets demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the proposed self-supervision based link prediction algorithm\nover state-of-the-art baselines on different types of networks under both\ntransductive and inductive settings.

A synthesis network, also\nsometimes referred to as refinement network, can then be used to generate the\noutput frame from the warped images. In doing so, it is common to not only warp\nthe images but also various feature representations which provide rich\ncontextual cues to the synthesis network.

The\nstate-of-the-art methods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nHowever, they may fail due to lack of training data, resulting in high rates of\nmissed detection and false positives (FPs). In order to solve these problems,\nour method combines the two-dimensional (2-D) CNN-based real-time object\ndetector network with spatiotemporal information. Firstly, we use a 2-D\ndetector network to detect static images and frames, and based on the detector\nnetwork, we propose two feature enhancement modules-the FP Relearning Module\n(FPRM) to make the detector network learning more about the features of FPs for\nhigher precision, and the Image Style Transfer Module (ISTM) to enhance the\nfeatures of polyps for sensitivity improvement. In video detection, we\nintegrate spatiotemporal information, which uses Structural Similarity (SSIM)\nto measure the similarity between video frames. Finally, we propose the\nInter-frame Similarity Correlation Unit (ISCU) to combine the results obtained\nby the detector network and frame similarity to make the final decision. We\nverify our method on both private databases and publicly available databases.\nExperimental results show that these modules and units provide a performance\nimprovement compared with the baseline method.

    "title": "Dynamics-Aware Comparison of Learned Reward Functions",
    "abstract": "The ability to learn reward functions plays an important role in enabling the\ndeployment of intelligent agents in the real world. However, comparing reward\nfunctions, for example as a means of evaluating reward learning methods,\npresents a challenge. Reward functions are typically compared by considering\nthe behavior of optimized policies, but this approach conflates deficiencies in\nthe reward function with those of the policy search algorithm used to optimize\nit. To address this challenge, Gleave et al. (2020) propose the\nEquivalent-Policy Invariant Comparison (EPIC) distance. EPIC avoids policy\noptimization, but in doing so requires computing reward values at transitions\nthat may be impossible under the system dynamics. This is problematic for\nlearned reward functions because it entails evaluating them outside of their\ntraining distribution, resulting in inaccurate reward values that we show can\nrender EPIC ineffective at comparing rewards. To address this problem, we\npropose the Dynamics-Aware Reward Distance (DARD), a new reward pseudometric.\nDARD uses an approximate transition model of the environment to transform\nreward functions into a form that allows for comparisons that are invariant to\nreward shaping while only evaluating reward functions on transitions close to\ntheir training distribution. Experiments in simulated physical domains\ndemonstrate that DARD enables reliable reward comparisons without policy\noptimization and is significantly more predictive than baseline methods of\ndownstream policy performance when dealing with learned reward functions.",

The\naverage execution time of a coded computing system is related to the error\nprobability for transmission over the binary erasure channel in recent work by\nSoleymani, Jamali and Mahdavifar, where the performance of binary linear codes\nis investigated. In this paper, we focus on polar codes and unveil a connection\nbetween the average execution time and the scaling exponent $\\mu$ of the family\nof codes. The scaling exponent has emerged as a central object in the\nfinite-length characterization of polar codes, and it captures the speed of\nconvergence to capacity. In particular, we show that (i) the gap between the\nnormalized average execution time of polar codes and that of optimal MDS codes\nis $O(n^{-1/\\mu})$, and (ii) this upper bound can be improved to roughly\n$O(n^{-1/2})$ by considering polar codes with large kernels.

    "abstract": "It is interesting but difficult and challenging to study Ethereum with\nmultiple mining pools. One of the main difficulties comes from not only how to\nrepresent such a general tree with multiple block branches (or sub-chains)\nrelated to the multiple mining pools, but also how to analyze a\nmulti-dimensional stochastic system due to the mining competition among the\nmultiple mining pools. In this paper, we first set up a mathematical\nrepresentation for the tree with multiple block branches. Then we provide a\nblock classification of Ethereum: Regular blocks (in the main chain), orphan\nblocks, uncle blocks, stale blocks, and nephew blocks, and give some key\nprobabilities of generating the different types of blocks by applying the law\nof large numbers. Based on this, we further discuss the growth rate of\nblockchain, and the reward allocation among the multiple mining pools through\napplying the renewal reward theorem. Finally, we use some simulation\nexperiments to verify our theoretical results, and show that the approximate\ncomputation approaches developed, such as the key probabilities, the long-term\ngrowth rate of blockchain, and the long-term reward allocation (rate) among the\nmultiple mining pools, can have a faster convergence. Therefore, we provide a\npowerful tool for observing and understanding the influence of the selfish\nmining attacks on the performance of Ethereum with multiple mining pools.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has attracted much attention as a privacy-preserving\ndistributed machine learning framework, where many clients collaboratively\ntrain a machine learning model by exchanging model updates with a parameter\nserver instead of sharing their raw data. Nevertheless, FL training suffers\nfrom slow convergence and unstable performance due to stragglers caused by the\nheterogeneous computational resources of clients and fluctuating communication\nrates. This paper proposes a coded FL framework, namely stochastic coded\nfederated learning (SCFL) to mitigate the straggler issue. In the proposed\nframework, each client generates a privacy-preserving coded dataset by adding\nadditive noise to the random linear combination of its local data. The server\ncollects the coded datasets from all the clients to construct a composite\ndataset, which helps to compensate for the straggling effect. In the training\nprocess, the server as well as clients perform mini-batch stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD), and the server adds a make-up term in model aggregation to\nobtain unbiased gradient estimates. We characterize the privacy guarantee by\nthe mutual information differential privacy (MI-DP) and analyze the convergence\nperformance in federated learning. Besides, we demonstrate a\nprivacy-performance tradeoff of the proposed SCFL method by analyzing the\ninfluence of the privacy constraint on the convergence rate.

FDIP can assign the time-sensitive flows with different groups, hence\ndelivering diverse QoS requirements, simultaneously. The ultra-low latency\ncommunication can be achieved by specific groups with short cycle lengths.\nMoreover, the flexible scheduling with diverse cycle lengths improves resource\nutilization, hence increasing the throughput (i.e., the number of acceptable\ntime-sensitive flows). We formulate a throughput maximization problem that\njointly considers the admission control, transmission path selection, and cycle\nlength assignment.

Many computer vision systems rely on random sampling heuristics to\nsolve robust fitting, which do not provide optimality guarantees and error\nbounds. It is therefore critical to develop novel approaches that can bridge\nthe gap between exact solutions that are costly, and fast heuristics that offer\nno quality assurances. In this paper, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical\nalgorithm for robust fitting. Our core contribution is a novel robust fitting\nformulation that solves a sequence of integer programs and terminates with a\nglobal solution or an error bound. The combinatorial subproblems are amenable\nto a quantum annealer, which helps to tighten the bound efficiently. While our\nusage of quantum computing does not surmount the fundamental intractability of\nrobust fitting, by providing error bounds our algorithm is a practical\nimprovement over randomised heuristics.

    "abstract": "IEEE 802.1Qbv (TAS) is the most widely used technique in Time-Sensitive\nNetworking (TSN) which aims to provide bounded transmission delays and\nultra-low jitters in industrial local area networks. With the development of\nemerging technologies (e.g., cloud computing), many wide-range time-sensitive\nnetwork services emerge, such as factory automation, connected vehicles, and\nsmart grids. Nevertheless, TAS is a Layer 2 technique for local networks, and\ncannot provide large-scale deterministic transmission. To tackle this problem,\nthis paper proposes a hierarchical network containing access networks and a\ncore network. Access networks perform TAS to aggregate time-sensitive traffic.\nIn the core network, we exploit DIP (a well-known deterministic networking\nmechanism for backbone networks) to achieve long-distance deterministic\ntransmission. Due to the differences between TAS and DIP, we design\ncross-domain transmission mechanisms at the edge of access networks and the\ncore network to achieve seamless deterministic transmission. We also formulate\nthe end-to-end scheduling to maximize the amount of accepted time-sensitive\ntraffic. Experimental simulations show that the proposed network can achieve\nend-to-end deterministic transmission even in high-loaded scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The massive context of electronic health records (EHRs) has created enormous\npotentials for improving healthcare, among which structured (coded) data and\nunstructured (text) data are two important textual modalities. They do not\nexist in isolation and can complement each other in most real-life clinical\nscenarios. Most existing researches in medical informatics, however, either\nonly focus on a particular modality or straightforwardly concatenate the\ninformation from different modalities, which ignore the interaction and\ninformation sharing between them. To address these issues, we proposed a\nunified deep learning-based medical pre-trained language model, named UMM-PLM,\nto automatically learn representative features from multimodal EHRs that\nconsist of both structured data and unstructured data. Specifically, we first\ndeveloped parallel unimodal information representation modules to capture the\nunimodal-specific characteristic, where unimodal representations were learned\nfrom each data source separately. A cross-modal module was further introduced\nto model the interactions between different modalities. We pre-trained the\nmodel on a large EHRs dataset containing both structured data and unstructured\ndata and verified the effectiveness of the model on three downstream clinical\ntasks, i.e., medication recommendation, 30-day readmission and ICD coding\nthrough extensive experiments. The results demonstrate the power of UMM-PLM\ncompared with benchmark methods and state-of-the-art baselines. Analyses show\nthat UMM-PLM can effectively concern with multimodal textual information and\nhas the potential to provide more comprehensive interpretations for clinical\ndecision making.",

    "abstract": "Power estimation is the basis of many hardware optimization strategies.\nHowever, it is still challenging to offer accurate power estimation at an early\nstage such as high-level synthesis (HLS). In this paper, we propose PowerGear,\na graph-learning-assisted power estimation approach for FPGA HLS, which\nfeatures high accuracy, efficiency and transferability. PowerGear comprises two\nmain components: a graph construction flow and a customized graph neural\nnetwork (GNN) model. Specifically, in the graph construction flow, we introduce\nbuffer insertion, datapath merging, graph trimming and feature annotation\ntechniques to transform HLS designs into graph-structured data, which encode\nboth intra-operation micro-architectures and inter-operation interconnects\nannotated with switching activities. Furthermore, we propose a novel\npower-aware heterogeneous edge-centric GNN model which effectively learns\nheterogeneous edge semantics and structural properties of the constructed\ngraphs via edge-centric neighborhood aggregation, and fits the formulation of\ndynamic power. Compared with on-board measurement, PowerGear estimates total\nand dynamic power for new HLS designs with errors of 3.60% and 8.81%,\nrespectively, which outperforms the prior arts in research and the commercial\nproduct Vivado. In addition, PowerGear demonstrates a speedup of 4x over Vivado\npower estimator. Finally, we present a case study in which PowerGear is\nexploited to facilitate design space exploration for FPGA HLS, leading to a\nperformance gain of up to 11.2%, compared with methods using state-of-the-art\npredictive models.",

    "abstract": "This work studies a fundamental trade-off between privacy and welfare in\naggregation of privatized preferences of individuals. It presents the precise\nrate at which welfare decreases with increasing levels of privacy. Trade-offs\nin achieving privacy while maintaining accuracy or more recently in maintaining\nfairness have been studied so far in prior works. Social choice functions help\naggregate individual preferences while differentially private mechanisms\nprovide formal privacy guarantees to release answers of queries operating on\ndata. However, once differential privacy inducing noise is introduced into a\nvoting system, the deterministic social choice function used to release an\naggregated choice may not be ideal anymore. It might change the power balances\nbetween the voters. It could be the case that an alternate social choice\nfunction becomes more ideal to aggregate the preferences. There could be a\nconstraint to operate the voting system at a specific level of either privacy\nor influence or welfare, and one would like to know the effects on rest of the\nunconstrained choices. In this paper, we introduce notions of welfare and\nprobabilistic influence of privatization mechanisms to help precisely answer\nsuch questions through the proposed results. Throughout the paper, we restrict\nour work to social choice functions where several voters vote for either of two\ncandidates. We present two different ways of proving each of our results that\nconnects privacy with welfare & probabilistic influence: i.) by using first\nprinciples from combinatorics/probability, ii.) by using Fourier analysis of\nBoolean functions. Finally, we analyze the accuracy of the private mechanism on\nvarious social choice functions. The results in this paper thereby help bridge\ntwo prominent fields of social choice theory and differential privacy.",

In order to significantly reduce\nthe requirements on data (especially time-dependent data), as well as decrease\ngeneralization error, our approach utilizes a data-driven neural network only\nto capture quasistatic information (instead of dynamic or time-dependent\ninformation). Subsequently, we augment our quasistatic neural network (QNN)\ninference with a (real-time) dynamic simulation layer. Our key insight is that\nthe dynamic modes lost when using a QNN approximation can be captured with a\nquite simple (and decoupled) zero-restlength spring model, which can be\nintegrated analytically (as opposed to numerically) and thus has no time-step\nstability restrictions. Additionally, we demonstrate that the spring\nconstitutive parameters can be robustly learned from a surprisingly small\namount of dynamic simulation data.

    "abstract": "Periodic double auctions (PDA) have applications in many areas such as in\ne-commerce, intra-day equity markets, and day-ahead energy markets in\nsmart-grids. While the trades accomplished using PDAs are worth trillions of\ndollars, finding a reliable bidding strategy in such auctions is still a\nchallenge as it requires the consideration of future auctions. A participating\nbuyer in a PDA has to design its bidding strategy by planning for current and\nfuture auctions. Many equilibrium-based bidding strategies proposed are complex\nto use in real-time. In the current exposition, we propose a scale-based\nbidding strategy for buyers participating in PDA. We first present an\nequilibrium analysis for single-buyer single-seller multi-unit single-shot\nk-Double auctions. Specifically, we analyze the situation when a seller and a\nbuyer trade two identical units of quantity in a double auction where both the\nbuyer and the seller deploy a simple, scale-based bidding strategy. The\nequilibrium analysis becomes intractable as the number of participants\nincreases. To be useful in more complex settings such as wholesale markets in\nsmart-grids, we model equilibrium bidding strategy as a learning problem. We\ndevelop a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based learning strategy,\nDDPGBBS, for a participating agent in PDAs to suggest an action at any auction\ninstance. DDPGBBS, which empirically follows the obtained theoretical\nequilibrium, is easily extendable when the number of buyers/sellers increases.\nWe take Power Trading Agent Competition's (PowerTAC) wholesale market PDA as a\ntestbed to evaluate our novel bidding strategy. We benchmark our DDPG based\nstrategy against several baselines and state-of-the-art bidding strategies of\nthe PowerTAC wholesale market PDA and demonstrate the efficacy of DDPGBBS\nagainst several benchmarked strategies.",

The underlying task at\nhand is to carefully model fine-grained features of the signatures to\ndistinguish between genuine and forged ones, which differ only in minute\ndeformities. This makes OSV more challenging compared to other verification\nproblems. In this work, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that\nleverages self-supervised representation learning as well as metric learning\nfor writer-independent OSV. First, we train an image reconstruction network\nusing an encoder-decoder architecture that is augmented by a 2D spatial\nattention mechanism using signature image patches. Next, the trained encoder\nbackbone is fine-tuned with a projector head using a supervised metric learning\nframework, whose objective is to optimize a novel dual triplet loss by sampling\nnegative samples from both within the same writer class as well as from other\nwriters. The intuition behind this is to ensure that a signature sample lies\ncloser to its positive counterpart compared to negative samples from both\nintra-writer and cross-writer sets. This results in robust discriminative\nlearning of the embedding space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work of using self-supervised learning frameworks for OSV.

    "abstract": "For scenes such as floods and earthquakes, the disaster area is large, and\nrescue time is tight. Multi-UAV exploration is more efficient than a single\nUAV. Existing UAV exploration work is modeled as a Coverage Path Planning (CPP)\ntask to achieve full coverage of the area in the presence of obstacles.\nHowever, the endurance capability of UAV is limited, and the rescue time is\nurgent. Thus, even using multiple UAVs cannot achieve complete disaster area\ncoverage in time. Therefore, in this paper we propose a multi-Agent\nEndurance-limited CPP (MAEl-CPP) problem based on a priori heatmap of the\ndisaster area, which requires the exploration of more valuable areas under\nlimited energy. Furthermore, we propose a path planning algorithm for the\nMAEl-CPP problem, by ranking the possible disaster areas according to their\nimportance through satellite or remote aerial images and completing path\nplanning according to the importance level. Experimental results show that our\nproposed algorithm is at least twice as effective as the existing method in\nterms of search efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based image fusion approaches have obtained wide attention in\nrecent years, achieving promising performance in terms of visual perception.\nHowever, the fusion module in the current deep learning-based methods suffers\nfrom two limitations, \\textit{i.e.}, manually designed fusion function, and\ninput-independent network learning. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised\nadaptive image fusion method to address the above issues. We propose a feature\nmutual mapping fusion module and dual-branch multi-scale autoencoder. More\nspecifically, we construct a global map to measure the connections of pixels\nbetween the input source images. % The found mapping relationship guides the\nimage fusion. Besides, we design a dual-branch multi-scale network through\nsampling transformation to extract discriminative image features. We further\nenrich feature representations of different scales through feature aggregation\nin the decoding process. Finally, we propose a modified loss function to train\nthe network with efficient convergence property. Through sufficient training on\ninfrared and visible image data sets, our method also shows excellent\ngeneralized performance in multi-focus and medical image fusion. Our method\nachieves superior performance in both visual perception and objective\nevaluation.

By decomposing a coarse-graining operation\ninto two processes: information conversion and information dropping out, we can\nnot only exactly control the width of the information channel, but also can\nderive some important properties analytically including the exact expression of\nthe effective information of a macro-dynamics.

To this end, we describe a data-driven mutation analysis technique\n(DaMAT) that automatically alters the data exchanged through data buffers.

    "abstract": "Traditional media coding schemes typically encode image/video into a\nsemantic-unknown binary stream, which fails to directly support downstream\nintelligent tasks at the bitstream level. Semantically Structured Image Coding\n(SSIC) framework makes the first attempt to enable decoding-free or\npartial-decoding image intelligent task analysis via a Semantically Structured\nBitstream (SSB). However, the SSIC only considers image coding and its\ngenerated SSB only contains the static object information. In this paper, we\nextend the idea of semantically structured coding from video coding perspective\nand propose an advanced Semantically Structured Video Coding (SSVC) framework\nto support heterogeneous intelligent applications. Video signals contain more\nrich dynamic motion information and exist more redundancy due to the similarity\nbetween adjacent frames. Thus, we present a reformulation of semantically\nstructured bitstream (SSB) in SSVC which contains both static object\ncharacteristics and dynamic motion clues. Specifically, we introduce optical\nflow to encode continuous motion information and reduce cross-frame redundancy\nvia a predictive coding architecture, then the optical flow and residual\ninformation are reorganized into SSB, which enables the proposed SSVC could\nbetter adaptively support video-based downstream intelligent applications.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SSVC framework could\ndirectly support multiple intelligent tasks just depending on a partially\ndecoded bitstream. This avoids the full bitstream decompression and thus\nsignificantly saves bitrate/bandwidth consumption for intelligent analytics. We\nverify this point on the tasks of image object detection, pose estimation,\nvideo action recognition, video object segmentation, etc.",

The overall\ntraining is balanced by two key losses that play different roles, namely span\nlocalization loss and set guidance loss.

Throughout the\ntraining, VidGTR first explores the search space to diversify the initial\nproposals and then matches the proposals to the corresponding targets to fit\nthem in a fine-grained manner. The explore-and-match scheme successfully\ncombines the strengths of two complementary methods, without encoding prior\nknowledge into the pipeline.

To overcome such limitations, in\nthis paper, we propose to utilize the radio signals, which can traverse\nobstacles and are unaffected by the lighting conditions to achieve silhouette\nsegmentation. The proposed RFMask framework is composed of three modules. It\nfirst transforms RF signals captured by millimeter wave radar on two planes\ninto spatial domain and suppress interference with the signal processing\nmodule. Then, it locates human reflections on RF frames and extract features\nfrom surrounding signals with human detection module. Finally, the extracted\nfeatures from RF frames are aggregated with an attention based mask generation\nmodule. To verify our proposed framework, we collect a dataset containing\n804,760 radio frames and 402,380 camera frames with human activities under\nvarious scenes. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can\nachieve impressive human silhouette segmentation even under the challenging\nscenarios(such as low light and occlusion scenarios) where traditional\noptical-camera-based methods fail. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst investigation towards segmenting human silhouette based on millimeter\nwave signals.

    "abstract": "This report proposes state-of-the-art research in the field of Computer\nAssisted Language Learning (CALL). Mispronunciation detection is one of the\ncore components of Computer Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems\nwhich is a subset of CALL. Studies on automated pronunciation error detection\nbegan in the 1990s, but the development of fullfledged CAPTs has only\naccelerated in the last decade due to an increase in computing power and\navailability of mobile devices for recording speech required for pronunciation\nanalysis. Detecting Pronunciation errors is a hard problem to solve as there is\nno formal definition of correct and incorrect pronunciation. As a result,\ntypically prosodic and phoneme errors such as phoneme substitution, insertion,\nand deletion are detected. Also, it has been agreed upon that learning\npronunciation should focus on speaker intelligibility rather than sounding like\nan L1 English speaker. Initially, methods were developed on posterior\nlikelihood called Good of Pronunciation using Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden\nMarkov Model and Deep Neural Network-Hidden Markov Model approaches. These are\ncomplex systems to implement when compared with the recently proposed ASR based\nEnd-to-End mispronunciations detection systems. The purpose of this research is\nto create End-to-End (E2E) models using Connectionist Temporal Classification\n(CTC) and Attention-based sequence decoder. Recently, E2E models have shown\nconsiderable improvement in mispronunciation detection accuracy.

In particular, POD-DL-ROMs can\nachieve extreme efficiency in the training stage and faster than real-time\nperformances at testing, thanks to a prior dimensionality reduction through POD\nand a DL-based prediction framework. Nonetheless, they share with conventional\nROMs poor performances regarding time extrapolation tasks. This work aims at\ntaking a further step towards the use of DL algorithms for the efficient\nnumerical approximation of parametrized PDEs by introducing the $\\mu\nt$-POD-LSTM-ROM framework. This novel technique extends the POD-DL-ROM\nframework by adding a two-fold architecture taking advantage of long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) cells, ultimately allowing long-term prediction of complex\nsystems' evolution, with respect to the training window, for unseen input\nparameter values. Numerical results show that this recurrent architecture\nenables the extrapolation for time windows up to 15 times larger than the\ntraining time domain, and achieves better testing time performances with\nrespect to the already lightning-fast POD-DL-ROMs.",

However, a\nmajor challenge on the road to artificial agents is concept drift, that is, the\ndata probability distribution would change where the data instance arrives\nsequentially in a stream fashion, which would lead to catastrophic forgetting\nand degrade the performance of the model. In this paper, we proposed a new\nBilevel Online Deep Learning (BODL) framework, which combine bilevel\noptimization strategy and online ensemble classifier. In BODL algorithm, we use\nan ensemble classifier, which use the output of different hidden layers in deep\nneural network to build multiple base classifiers, the important weights of the\nbase classifiers are updated according to exponential gradient descent method\nin an online manner. Besides, we apply the similar constraint to overcome the\nconvergence problem of online ensemble framework.

Here, the system vulnerability refers to\nthe existence of key observation sequences that could be exploited by a\nspecific smart sensor attack to cause damage infliction. We consider a\nnondeterministic smart attack, i.e., there might exist more than one attack\nchoice over each received observation, and adopt our previously proposed\nmodeling framework, where such an attack is captured by a standard finite-state\nautomaton. For a given supervisor S and a smart sensor attack model A, another\nsmart attack model A' is called attack equivalent to A with respect to S, if\nthe resulting compromised supervisor, defined as the composition of the\nsupervisor S and attack model A', is control equivalent to the original\ncompromised supervisor, defined as the composition of S and A. Following the\nspirit of supervisor reduction that relies on the concept of control\ncongruence, we will show that, this problem of synthesizing a reduced smart\nattack model A' that is attack equivalent to A with respect to S, can be\ntransformed to a classical supervisor reduction problem, making all existing\nsynthesis tools available for supervisor reduction directly applicable to our\nproblem. A simplified and ideally minimum-state attack model can reveal all\nnecessary observation sequences for the attacker to be successful, thus,\nreminds system designers to take necessary precautions in advance, which may\nimprove system resilience significantly.

    "abstract": "This work elevates coded caching networks from their purely\ninformation-theoretic framework to a stochastic setting, by exploring the\neffect of random user activity and by exploiting correlations in the activity\npatterns of different users. In particular, the work studies the $K$-user\ncache-aided broadcast channel with a limited number of cache states, and\nexplores the effect of cache state association strategies in the presence of\narbitrary user activity levels; a combination that strikes at the very core of\nthe coded caching problem and its crippling subpacketization bottleneck. We\nfirst present a statistical analysis of the average worst-case delay\nperformance of such subpacketization-constrained (state-constrained) coded\ncaching networks, and provide computationally efficient performance bounds as\nwell as scaling laws for any arbitrary probability distribution of the\nuser-activity levels. The achieved performance is a result of a novel\nuser-to-cache state association algorithm that leverages the knowledge of\nprobabilistic user-activity levels.\nWe then follow a data-driven approach that exploits the prior history on\nuser-activity levels and correlations, in order to predict interference\npatterns, and thus better design the caching algorithm. This optimized strategy\nis based on the principle that users that overlap more, interfere more, and\nthus have higher priority to secure complementary cache states. This strategy\nis proven here to be within a small constant factor from the optimal. Finally,\nthe above analysis is validated numerically using synthetic data following the\nPareto principle. To the best of our understanding, this is the first work that\nseeks to exploit user-activity levels and correlations, in order to map future\ninterference and design optimized coded caching algorithms that better handle\nthis interference.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the information freshness of two-hop networks. Age of\ninformation (AoI) is used as the metric to characterize the information\nfreshness, defined as the time elapsed since the latest received status update\nwas generated. In error-prone wireless networks, prior studies indicated that\nAutomatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) does not help improve the average AoI\nperformance of single-hop networks, because sending a new packet always carries\nthe most up-to-date information (i.e., discarding the old packet). We believe\nthat this observation does not apply to two-hop networks. For example, when a\npacket transmission fails in the second hop, although a new packet has more\nrecent information, it may require more time to be delivered (i.e., the\ncommunication has to restart from the first hop), thus leading to a high AoI.\nThis paper analyzes the theoretical average AoI of two-hop networks with and\nwithout ARQ. Specifically, we model the two schemes using Markov chains, from\nwhich we derive the average AoI. Our theoretical and simulation results confirm\nthat, unlike single-hop networks, ARQ should be used in two-hop networks to\nachieve lower average AoI. In particular, when ARQ is used, the successful\ndecoding probability of the second hop has a greater impact on the average AoI\nthan that of the first hop. Overall, our findings provide insight into the ARQ\ndesign for two-hop timely status update systems.",

    "abstract": "Algorithms based on deep network models are being used for many pattern\nrecognition and decision-making tasks in robotics and AI. Training these models\nrequires a large labeled dataset and considerable computational resources,\nwhich are not readily available in many domains. Also, it is difficult to\nexplore the internal representations and reasoning mechanisms of these models.\nAs a step towards addressing the underlying knowledge representation,\nreasoning, and learning challenges, the architecture described in this paper\ndraws inspiration from research in cognitive systems. As a motivating example,\nwe consider an assistive robot trying to reduce clutter in any given scene by\nreasoning about the occlusion of objects and stability of object configurations\nin an image of the scene. In this context, our architecture incrementally\nlearns and revises a grounding of the spatial relations between objects and\nuses this grounding to extract spatial information from input images.\nNon-monotonic logical reasoning with this information and incomplete\ncommonsense domain knowledge is used to make decisions about stability and\nocclusion. For images that cannot be processed by such reasoning, regions\nrelevant to the tasks at hand are automatically identified and used to train\ndeep network models to make the desired decisions. Image regions used to train\nthe deep networks are also used to incrementally acquire previously unknown\nstate constraints that are merged with the existing knowledge for subsequent\nreasoning. Experimental evaluation performed using simulated and real-world\nimages indicates that in comparison with baselines based just on deep networks,\nour architecture improves reliability of decision making and reduces the effort\ninvolved in training data-driven deep network models.",

In particular, there is no known\nelementary bound on the complexity of translating deterministic\n$\\omega$-regular automata to LTL.\nOur first contribution consists of tight bounds for LTL over a unary\nalphabet: alternating, nondeterministic and deterministic automata can be\nexactly exponentially, quadratically and linearly more succinct, respectively,\nthan any equivalent LTL formula. Our main contribution consists of a\ntranslation of general counter-free deterministic $\\omega$-regular automata\ninto LTL formulas of double exponential temporal-nesting depth and triple\nexponential length, using an intermediate Krohn-Rhodes cascade decomposition of\nthe automaton. To our knowledge, this is the first elementary bound on this\ntranslation.

    "abstract": "Defects during production may lead to material waste, which is a significant\nchallenge for many companies as it reduces revenue and negatively impacts\nsustainability and the environment. An essential reason for material waste is a\nlow degree of automation, especially in industries that currently have a low\ndegree of digitalization, such as steel forging. Those industries typically\nrely on heavy and old machinery such as large induction ovens that are mostly\ncontrolled manually or using well-known recipes created by experts. However,\nstandard recipes may fail when unforeseen events happen, such as an unplanned\nstop in production, which may lead to overheating and thus material degradation\nduring the forging process. In this paper, we develop a digital twin-based\noptimization strategy for the heating process for a forging line to automate\nthe development of an optimal control policy that adjusts the power for the\nheating coils in an induction oven based on temperature data observed from\npyrometers. We design a digital twin-based deep reinforcement learning (DTRL)\nframework and train two different deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models for\nthe heating phase using a digital twin of the forging line. The twin is based\non a simulator that contains a heating transfer and movement model, which is\nused as an environment for the DRL training. Our evaluation shows that both\nmodels significantly reduce the temperature unevenness and can help to automate\nthe traditional heating process.",

Given a data set containing historical\ndecisions and delivery locations, the goal is to capture the implicit\npreferences of the decision-makers. We consider two ways to use the historical\ndata: one is through a probability estimation method that learns transition\nprobabilities between stops (or zones). This is a fast and accurate method,\nrecently studied in a VRP setting. Furthermore, we explore the use of machine\nlearning to infer how to best balance multiple objectives such as distance,\nprobability and penalties. Specifically, we cast the learning problem as a\nstructured output prediction problem, where training is done by repeatedly\ncalling the TSP solver. Another important aspect we consider is that for\nlast-mile delivery, every address is a potential client and hence the data is\nvery sparse. Hence, we propose a two-stage approach that first learns\npreferences at the zone level in order to compute a zone routing; after which a\npenalty-based TSP computes the stop routing. Results show that the zone\ntransition probability estimation performs well, and that the structured output\nprediction learning can improve the results further. We hence showcase a\nsuccessful combination of both probability estimation and machine learning, all\nthe while using standard TSP solvers, both during learning and to compute the\nfinal solution; this means the methodology is applicable to other, real-life,\nTSP variants, or proprietary solvers.",

We ended up with the concept of\ninteractive cockpits, not because pilots interacted with mechanical things, but\nbecause they interacted using pointing devices on computer displays. Since the\nearly 2000s, complexity and organizational issues gained prominence to the\npoint that complex systems design and management found itself center stage,\nwith the spotlight on the role of the human element and organizational setups.\nToday, Human Systems Integration (HSI) is no longer only a single-agent\nproblem, but a multi-agent research field.

    "abstract": "Several studies have shown the ability of natural gradient descent to\nminimize the objective function more efficiently than ordinary gradient descent\nbased methods. However, the bottleneck of this approach for training deep\nneural networks lies in the prohibitive cost of solving a large dense linear\nsystem corresponding to the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) at each iteration.\nThis has motivated various approximations of either the exact FIM or the\nempirical one. The most sophisticated of these is KFAC, which involves a\nKronecker-factored block diagonal approximation of the FIM. With only a slight\nadditional cost, a few improvements of KFAC from the standpoint of accuracy are\nproposed. The common feature of the four novel methods is that they rely on a\ndirect minimization problem, the solution of which can be computed via the\nKronecker product singular value decomposition technique. Experimental results\non the three standard deep auto-encoder benchmarks showed that they provide\nmore accurate approximations to the FIM. Furthermore, they outperform KFAC and\nstate-of-the-art first-order methods in terms of optimization speed.",

    "abstract": "Algebraic effects offer a versatile framework that covers a wide variety of\neffects. However, the family of operations that delimit scopes are not\nalgebraic and are usually modelled as handlers, thus preventing them from being\nused freely in conjunction with algebraic operations. Although proposals for\nscoped operations exist, they are either ad-hoc and unprincipled, or too\ninconvenient for practical programming. This paper provides the best of both\nworlds: a theoretically-founded model of scoped effects that is convenient for\nimplementation and reasoning. Our new model is based on an adjunction between a\nlocally finitely presentable category and a category of functorial algebras.\nUsing comparison functors between adjunctions, we show that our new model, an\nexisting indexed model, and a third approach that simulates scoped operations\nin terms of algebraic ones have equal expressivity for handling scoped\noperations. We consider our new model to be the sweet spot between ease of\nimplementation and structuredness. Additionally, our approach automatically\ninduces fusion laws of handlers of scoped effects, which are useful for\nreasoning and optimisation.",

Many researchers suggest using\npost-hoc explanation algorithms for this purpose. In this paper, we combine\nlegal, philosophical and technical arguments to show that post-hoc explanation\nalgorithms are unsuitable to achieve the law's objectives. Indeed, most\nsituations where explanations are requested are adversarial, meaning that the\nexplanation provider and receiver have opposing interests and incentives, so\nthat the provider might manipulate the explanation for her own ends. We show\nthat this fundamental conflict cannot be resolved because of the high degree of\nambiguity of post-hoc explanations in realistic application scenarios. As a\nconsequence, post-hoc explanation algorithms are unsuitable to achieve the\ntransparency objectives inherent to the legal norms. Instead, there is a need\nto more explicitly discuss the objectives underlying \"explainability\"\nobligations as these can often be better achieved through other mechanisms.\nThere is an urgent need for a more open and honest discussion regarding the\npotential and limitations of post-hoc explanations in adversarial contexts, in\nparticular in light of the current negotiations about the European Union's\ndraft Artificial Intelligence Act.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of distributed energy sources, the advantages of\nsmart buildings over traditional buildings are becoming increasingly obvious.\nSubsequently, its energy optimal scheduling and multi-objective optimization\nhave become more and more complex and need to be solved urgently. This paper\npresents a novel method to optimize energy utilization in smart buildings.\nFirstly, multiple transfer-retention ratio (TRR) parameters are added to the\nevaluation of distributed renewable energy. Secondly, the normal-boundary\nintersection (NBI) algorithm is improved by the adaptive weight sum, the adjust\nuniform axes method, and Mahalanobis distance to form the improved\nnormal-boundary intersection (INBI) algorithm. The multi-objective optimization\nproblem in smart buildings is solved by the parameter TRR and INBI algorithm to\nimprove the regulation efficiency. In response to the needs of decision-makers\nwith evaluation indicators, the average deviation is reduced by 60% compared\nwith the previous case. Numerical examples show that the proposed method is\nsuperior to the existing technologies in terms of three optimization\nobjectives.

    "abstract": "Predicting the supply and demand of transport systems is vital for efficient\ntraffic management, control, optimization, and planning. For example,\npredicting where from/to and when people intend to travel by taxi can support\nfleet managers to distribute resources; better predicting traffic\nspeeds/congestion allows for pro-active control measures or for users to better\nchoose their paths. Making spatio-temporal predictions is known to be a hard\ntask, but recently Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied on\nnon-euclidean spatial data. However, most GNN models require a predefined\ngraph, and so far, researchers rely on heuristics to generate this graph for\nthe model to use. In this paper, we use Neural Relational Inference to learn\nthe optimal graph for the model. Our approach has several advantages: 1) a\nVariational Auto Encoder structure allows for the graph to be dynamically\ndetermined by the data, potentially changing through time; 2) the encoder\nstructure allows the use of external data in the generation of the graph; 3) it\nis possible to place Bayesian priors on the generated graphs to encode domain\nknowledge. We conduct experiments on two datasets, namely the NYC Yellow Taxi\nand the PEMS road traffic datasets. In both datasets, we outperform benchmarks\nand show performance comparable to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we do an\nin-depth analysis of the learned graphs, providing insights on what kinds of\nconnections GNNs use for spatio-temporal predictions in the transport domain.",

    "abstract": "In spite of extended recent interest in System Reliability-Based Design\nOptimization (System RBDO) and life-cycle cost or Risk Optimization (RO), there\nis a lack of published studies on optimal design of redundant hyperstatic\nsystems with objective consideration of (a) progressive collapse and (b) the\nimpact of epistemic uncertainties. This paper investigates the fundamental\naspects of the problem, by addressing the optimal design of simple two-bar\nactive and passive redundant systems. Progressive collapse is objectively\naddressed, differentiating consequences of direct collapse of statically\ndeterminate structures, and progressive collapse of redundant, statically\nindeterminate structures. It is well known that reliability of a structural\nsystem also depends on nonstructural factors, or factors beyond structural\ndesign, such as unanticipated loading, manufacturing quality, quality of\nworkmanship and human errors. These factors can be taken into account in an\nencompassing risk analysis, which accounts for physical and epistemic\nuncertainties, and which contributes a fixed latent failure probability to the\nstructural optimization problem. Results presented herein show that the latent\nfailure probability is the single most important parameter in determining\noptimal solutions, in System RBDO and in RO solutions. When the latent failure\nprobability is smaller than target (System RBDO) or optimal (RO) failure\nprobabilities, there is an equivalence between redundant and non-redundant\n(hyperstatic and isostatic) designs. However, when the latent reliability is\nsmaller than target or optimal reliabilities, optimal designs become\nnecessarily redundant (hyperstatic); as the only way to make system reliability\nlarger than the latent reliability is by making structural systems redundant.",

    "abstract": "Key Performance Indicators (KPI), which are essentially time series data,\nhave been widely used to indicate the performance of telecom networks. Based on\nthe given KPIs, a large set of anomaly detection algorithms have been deployed\nfor detecting the unexpected network incidents. Generally, unsupervised anomaly\ndetection algorithms gain more popularity than the supervised ones, due to the\nfact that labeling KPIs is extremely time- and resource-consuming, and\nerror-prone. However, those unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often\nsuffer from excessive false alarms, especially in the presence of concept\ndrifts resulting from network re-configurations or maintenance. To tackle this\nchallenge and improve the overall performance of unsupervised anomaly detection\nalgorithms, we propose to use active learning to introduce and benefit from the\nfeedback of operators, who can verify the alarms (both false and true ones) and\nlabel the corresponding KPIs with reasonable effort. Specifically, we develop\nthree query strategies to select the most informative and representative\nsamples to label. We also develop an efficient method to update the weights of\nIsolation Forest and optimally adjust the decision threshold, so as to\neventually improve the performance of detection model. The experiments with one\npublic dataset and one proprietary dataset demonstrate that our active learning\nempowered anomaly detection pipeline could achieve performance gain, in terms\nof F1-score, more than 50% over the baseline algorithm.

However, evaluating procedurally generated video game levels is often\ndifficult, due to the lack of standardised, game-independent metrics. In this\npaper, we introduce two simulation-based evaluation metrics that involve\nanalysing the behaviour of an A* agent to measure the diversity and difficulty\nof generated levels in a general, game-independent manner. Diversity is\ncalculated by comparing action trajectories from different levels using the\nedit distance, and difficulty is measured as how much exploration and expansion\nof the A* search tree is necessary before the agent can solve the level. We\ndemonstrate that our diversity metric is more robust to changes in level size\nand representation than current methods and additionally measures factors that\ndirectly affect playability, instead of focusing on visual information. The\ndifficulty metric shows promise, as it correlates with existing estimates of\ndifficulty in one of the tested domains, but it does face some challenges in\nthe other domain.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of deep joint source-channel coding (D-JSCC) for\ncorrelated image sources, where each source is transmitted through a noisy\nindependent channel to the common receiver. In particular, we consider a pair\nof images captured by two cameras with probably overlapping fields of view\ntransmitted over wireless channels and reconstructed in the center node. The\nchallenging problem involves designing a practical code to utilize both source\nand channel correlations to improve transmission efficiency without additional\ntransmission overhead. To tackle this, we need to consider the common\ninformation across two stereo images as well as the differences between two\ntransmission channels. In this case, we propose a deep neural networks solution\nthat includes lightweight edge encoders and a powerful center decoder. Besides,\nin the decoder, we propose a novel channel state information aware cross\nattention module to highlight the overlapping fields and leverage the relevance\nbetween two noisy feature maps.Our results show the impressive improvement of\nreconstruction quality in both links by exploiting the noisy representations of\nthe other link. Moreover, the proposed scheme shows competitive results\ncompared to the separated schemes with capacity-achieving channel codes.",

    "abstract": "Morphological attributes from histopathological images and molecular profiles\nfrom genomic data are important information to drive diagnosis, prognosis, and\ntherapy of cancers. By integrating these heterogeneous but complementary data,\nmany multi-modal methods are proposed to study the complex mechanisms of\ncancers, and most of them achieve comparable or better results from previous\nsingle-modal methods. However, these multi-modal methods are restricted to a\nsingle task (e.g., survival analysis or grade classification), and thus neglect\nthe correlation between different tasks. In this study, we present a\nmulti-modal fusion framework based on multi-task correlation learning\n(MultiCoFusion) for survival analysis and cancer grade classification, which\ncombines the power of multiple modalities and multiple tasks. Specifically, a\npre-trained ResNet-152 and a sparse graph convolutional network (SGCN) are used\nto learn the representations of histopathological images and mRNA expression\ndata respectively. Then these representations are fused by a fully connected\nneural network (FCNN), which is also a multi-task shared network. Finally, the\nresults of survival analysis and cancer grade classification output\nsimultaneously. The framework is trained by an alternate scheme. We\nsystematically evaluate our framework using glioma datasets from The Cancer\nGenome Atlas (TCGA). Results demonstrate that MultiCoFusion learns better\nrepresentations than traditional feature extraction methods. With the help of\nmulti-task alternating learning, even simple multi-modal concatenation can\nachieve better performance than other deep learning and traditional methods.\nMulti-task learning can improve the performance of multiple tasks not just one\nof them, and it is effective in both single-modal and multi-modal data.",

Data acquired from regions with high rates of\nvaccination, such as Israel, were blended with the current data of other\nregions in Japan to factor in the potential effects of vaccination.

However, adoption by\nresource-constrained groups, such as local municipalities, regulatory agencies,\nand researchers, has been hampered by the lack of a cost-effective,\nreadily-accessible baseline platform that can be adapted to their unique\nmissions.

In this work, we propose a novel approach\nto point selection using points of the form {-1/c , -c, c, 1/c } using the full\nrange of real-valued numbers for c. We show that groups of this form cause\ncancellations in the Winograd transform matrices that reduce numeric error. We\nfind empirically that the error for different values of c forms a rough curve\nacross the range of real-value numbers helping to localize the values of c that\nreduce error and that lower errors can be achieved with non-obvious real-valued\nevaluation points instead of integers or simple fractions. We study a range of\nsizes for small convolutions and achieve reduction in error ranging from 2% to\naround 59% for both 1D and 2D convolution.

Many bioinformatic\napplications require a specific decomposition where the paths correspond to\nsome underlying data that generated the flow. For real inputs, no optimization\ncriteria guarantees to uniquely identify the correct decomposition. Therefore,\nwe propose to report safe paths, i.e., subpaths of at least one path in every\nflow decomposition.\nMa, Zheng, and Kingsford [WABI 2020] addressed the existence of multiple\noptimal solutions in a probabilistic framework, i.e., non-identifiability.\nLater [RECOMB 2021], they gave a quadratic-time algorithm based on a global\ncriterion for solving a problem called AND-Quant, which generalizes the problem\nof reporting whether a given path is safe.\nWe give the first local characterization of safe paths for flow\ndecompositions in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), leading to a practical\nalgorithm for finding the complete set of safe paths.

In this paper, a\nmethodology for fine scale modeling of large scale structures is proposed,\nwhich combines the variational multiscale method, domain decomposition and\nmodel order reduction. Addressing applications where the assumption of scale\nseparation does not hold, the influence of the fine scale on the coarse scale\nis modelled directly by the use of an additive split of the displacement field.\nPossible coarse and fine scale solutions are exploited for a representative\nvolume element (RVE) to construct local approximation spaces. The local spaces\nare designed such that local contributions of RVE subdomains can be coupled in\na conforming way. Therefore, the resulting global system of equations takes the\neffect of the fine scale on the coarse scale into account, is sparse and\nreduced in size compared to the full order model. Several numerical experiments\nshow the accuracy and efficiency of the method.",

    "abstract": "Informational bias is widely present in news articles. It refers to providing\none-sided, selective or suggestive information of specific aspects of certain\nentity to guide a specific interpretation, thereby biasing the reader's\nopinion. Sentence-level informational bias detection is a very challenging task\nin a way that such bias can only be revealed together with the context,\nexamples include collecting information from various sources or analyzing the\nentire article in combination with the background. In this paper, we integrate\nthree levels of context to detect the sentence-level informational bias in\nEnglish news articles: adjacent sentences, whole article, and articles from\nother news outlets describing the same event. Our model, MultiCTX (Multi-level\nConTeXt), uses contrastive learning and sentence graphs together with Graph\nAttention Network (GAT) to encode these three degrees of context at different\nstages by tactically composing contrastive triplets and constructing sentence\ngraphs within events. Our experiments proved that contrastive learning together\nwith sentence graphs effectively incorporates context in varying degrees and\nsignificantly outperforms the current SOTA model sentence-wise in informational\nbias detection.",

    "abstract": "The peculiarity of adversarial team games resides in the asymmetric\ninformation available to the team members during the play, which makes the\nequilibrium computation problem hard even with zero-sum payoffs. The algorithms\navailable in the literature work with implicit representations of the strategy\nspace and mainly resort to Linear Programming and column generation techniques\nto enlarge incrementally the strategy space. Such representations prevent the\nadoption of standard tools such as abstraction generation, game solving, and\nsubgame solving, which demonstrated to be crucial when solving huge, real-world\ntwo-player zero-sum games. Differently from these works, we answer the question\nof whether there is any suitable game representation enabling the adoption of\nthose tools. In particular, our algorithms convert a sequential team game with\nadversaries to a classical two-player zero-sum game. In this converted game,\nthe team is transformed into a single coordinator player who only knows\ninformation common to the whole team and prescribes to the players an action\nfor any possible private state. Interestingly, we show that our game is more\nexpressive than the original extensive-form game as any state/action\nabstraction of the extensive-form game can be captured by our representation,\nwhile the reverse does not hold. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, the\nresulting Public Team game may be exponentially larger than the original one.\nTo limit this explosion, we provide three algorithms, each returning an\ninformation-lossless abstraction that dramatically reduces the size of the\ntree. These abstractions can be produced without generating the original game\ntree. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach by presenting\nexperimental results on Kuhn and Leduc Poker games, obtained by applying\nstate-of-art algorithms for two-player zero-sum games on the converted games",

    "abstract": "Data heterogeneity is an intrinsic property of recommender systems, making\nmodels trained over the global data on the cloud, which is the mainstream in\nindustry, non-optimal to each individual user's local data distribution. To\ndeal with data heterogeneity, model personalization with on-device learning is\na potential solution. However, on-device training using a user's small size of\nlocal samples will incur severe overfitting and undermine the model's\ngeneralization ability. In this work, we propose a new device-cloud\ncollaborative learning framework, called CoDA, to break the dilemmas of purely\ncloud-based learning and on-device learning. The key principle of CoDA is to\nretrieve similar samples from the cloud's global pool to augment each user's\nlocal dataset to train the recommendation model. Specifically, after a\ncoarse-grained sample matching on the cloud, a personalized sample classifier\nis further trained on each device for a fine-grained sample filtering, which\ncan learn the boundary between the local data distribution and the outside data\ndistribution. We also build an end-to-end pipeline to support the flows of\ndata, model, computation, and control between the cloud and each device. We\nhave deployed CoDA in a recommendation scenario of Mobile Taobao. Online A/B\ntesting results show the remarkable performance improvement of CoDA over both\ncloud-based learning without model personalization and on-device training\nwithout data augmentation. Overhead testing on a real device demonstrates the\ncomputation, storage, and communication efficiency of the on-device tasks in\nCoDA.",

This article aims to\nsubstantiate the concept of interspecies collaboration - that of natural and\nartificial intelligence - in the active co-creation of a visual identity,\ndescribing a case study of the Regional Center of Excellence for Robotic\nTechnology (CRTA) which opened on 750 m2 in June 2021 within the University of\nZagreb. The visual identity of the Center comprises three separately devised\nelements, each representative of the human-AI relationship and embedded in the\ninstitution's logo. Firstly, the letter \"C\" (from the CRTA acronym) was created\nusing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) applied to (x, y) coordinates that the\nneurosurgical robot RONNA, CRTA's flagship innovation, generated when\nhand-guided by a human operator. The second shape of the letter \"C\" was created\nby using the same (x, y) coordinates as inputs fed to a neural network whose\ngoal was to output letters in a novel, AI-generated typography. A basic\nfeedforward back-propagating neural network with two hidden layers was chosen\nfor the task. The final and third design element was a trajectory the robot\nRONNA makes when performing a brain biopsy. As CRTA embodies a state-of-the-art\nvenue for robotics research, the 'interspecies' approach was used to accentuate\nthe importance of human-robot collaboration which is at the core of the newly\nopened Center, illustrating the potential of reciprocal and amicable\nrelationship that humans could have with technology.",

It takes advantage of the fact that the\ndifferential operators in the Vlasov equation are tensor friendly, based on\nwhich we propose to dynamically and adaptively build up low rank solution basis\nby adding new basis functions from discretization of the differential equation,\nand removing basis from a singular value decomposition (SVD)-type truncation\nprocedure. For the discretization, we adopt a high order finite difference\nspatial discretization together with a second order strong stability preserving\nmulti-step time discretization.\nWhile the SVD truncation will remove the redundancy in representing the high\ndimensional Vlasov solution, it will destroy the conservation properties of the\nassociated full conservative scheme. In this paper, we develop a conservative\ntruncation procedure with conservation of mass, momentum and kinetic energy\ndensities. The conservative truncation is achieved by an orthogonal projection\nonto a subspace spanned by $1$, $v$ and $v^2$ in the velocity space associated\nwith a weighted inner product. Then the algorithm performs a weighted SVD\ntruncation of the remainder, which involves a scaling, followed by the standard\nSVD truncation and rescaling back. The algorithm is further developed in high\ndimensions with hierarchical Tucker tensor decomposition of high dimensional\nVlasov solutions, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. An extensive set of\nnonlinear Vlasov examples are performed to show the effectiveness and\nconservation property of proposed conservative low rank approach.

Protected groups don't need to be pre-specified: At any point,\nif it is discovered that there is some group on which our current model\nperforms substantially worse than optimally, then there is a simple update\noperation that improves the error on that group without increasing either\noverall error or the error on previously identified groups. We do not restrict\nthe complexity of the groups that can be identified, and they can intersect in\narbitrary ways. The key insight that allows us to break through the tradeoff\nbarrier is to dynamically expand the model class as new groups are identified.\nThe result is provably fast convergence to a model that can't be distinguished\nfrom the Bayes optimal predictor, at least by those tasked with finding high\nerror groups.\nWe explore two instantiations of this framework: as a \"bias bug bounty\"\ndesign in which external auditors are invited to discover groups on which our\ncurrent model's error is suboptimal, and as an algorithmic paradigm in which\nthe discovery of groups on which the error is suboptimal is posed as an\noptimization problem. In the bias bounty case, when we say that a model cannot\nbe distinguished from Bayes optimal, we mean by any participant in the bounty\nprogram. We provide both theoretical analysis and experimental validation.",

On-chip online learning provides such systems the ability\nto learn the statistics of the incoming data and to adapt to their changes.\nImplementing online learning on event driven-neuromorphic systems requires (i)\na spike-based learning algorithm that calculates the weight updates using only\nlocal information from streaming data, (ii) mapping these weight updates onto\nlimited bit precision memory and (iii) doing so in a robust manner that does\nnot lead to unnecessary updates as the system is reaching its optimal output.\nRecent neuroscience studies have shown how dendritic compartments of cortical\nneurons can solve these problems in biological neural networks.

The circuits are embedded in a prototype spiking\nneural network fabricated using a 180nm process. Following an\nalgorithm-circuits co-design approach we present circuits and behavioral\nsimulation results that demonstrate the learning rule features.

Extracting specific landmarks like the right\nventricular insertion points is of importance for spatial alignment and 3D\nmodeling. The automatic detection of such landmarks has been tackled by\nmultiple groups using Deep Learning, but relatively little attention has been\npaid to the failure cases of evaluation metrics in this field. In this work, we\nextended the public ACDC dataset with additional labels of the right\nventricular insertion points and compare different variants of a heatmap-based\nlandmark detection pipeline. In this comparison, we demonstrate very likely\npitfalls of apparently simple detection and localisation metrics which\nhighlights the importance of a clear detection strategy and the definition of\nan upper limit for localisation-based metrics. Our preliminary results indicate\nthat a combination of different metrics is necessary, as they yield different\nwinners for method comparison.

    "abstract": "Retrieving an object from cluttered spaces suchas cupboards, refrigerators,\nor bins requires tracking objects with limited or no visual sensing. In these\nscenarios, contact feedback is necessary to estimate the pose of the objects,\nyet the objects are movable while their shapes and number may be unknown,\nmaking the association of contacts with objects extremely difficult. While\nprevious work has focused on multi-target tracking, the assumptions therein\nprohibit using prior methods given only the contact-sensing modality. Instead,\nthis paper proposes the method Soft Tracking Using Contacts for Cluttered\nObjects (STUCCO) that tracks the belief over contact point locations and\nimplicit object associations using a particle filter. This method allows\nambiguous object associations of past contacts to be revised as new information\nbecomes available. We apply STUCCO to the Blind Object Retrieval problem, where\na target object of known shape but unknown pose must be retrieved from clutter.\nOur results suggest that our method outperforms baselines in four simulation\nenvironments, and on a real robot, where contact sensing is noisy.

Traditional serial time-marching schemes\nare a significant bottleneck, as many types of simulations require large\nnumbers of time-steps which must be computed sequentially. Parallel in Time\nschemes, such as the Multigrid Reduction in Time (MGRIT) method, remedy this by\nparallelizing across time-steps, and have shown promising results for parabolic\nproblems. However, chaotic problems have proved more difficult, since chaotic\ninitial value problems are inherently ill-conditioned.

While many TD learning methods have been\ndeveloped in recent years, little attention has been paid to preserving privacy\nand most of the existing approaches might face the concerns of data privacy\nfrom users. To enable complex representative abilities of policies, in this\npaper, we consider preserving privacy in TD learning with nonlinear value\nfunction approximation. This is challenging because such a nonlinear problem is\nusually studied in the formulation of stochastic nonconvex-strongly-concave\noptimization to gain finite-sample analysis, which would require simultaneously\npreserving the privacy on primal and dual sides. To this end, we employ a\nmomentum-based stochastic gradient descent ascent to achieve a single-timescale\nalgorithm, and achieve a good trade-off between meaningful privacy and utility\nguarantees of both the primal and dual sides by perturbing the gradients on\nboth sides using well-calibrated Gaussian noises.

    "abstract": "How many labeled pixels are needed to segment an image, without any prior\nknowledge? We conduct an experiment to answer this question.\nIn our experiment, an Oracle is using Active Learning to train a network from\nscratch. The Oracle has access to the entire label map of the image, but the\ngoal is to reveal as little pixel labels to the network as possible. We find\nthat, on average, the Oracle needs to reveal (i.e., annotate) less than $0.1\\%$\nof the pixels in order to train a network. The network can then label all\npixels in the image at an accuracy of more than $98\\%$.\nBased on this single-image-annotation experiment, we design an experiment to\nquickly annotate an entire data set. In the data set level experiment the\nOracle trains a new network for each image from scratch. The network can then\nbe used to create pseudo-labels, which are the network predicted labels of the\nunlabeled pixels, for the entire image. Only then, a data set level network is\ntrained from scratch on all the pseudo-labeled images at once.\nWe repeat both image level and data set level experiments on two, very\ndifferent, real-world data sets, and find that it is possible to reach the\nperformance of a fully annotated data set using a fraction of the annotation\ncost.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports on the first international competition on AI for the\ntraveling salesman problem (TSP) at the International Joint Conference on\nArtificial Intelligence 2021 (IJCAI-21). The TSP is one of the classical\ncombinatorial optimization problems, with many variants inspired by real-world\napplications. This first competition asked the participants to develop\nalgorithms to solve a time-dependent orienteering problem with stochastic\nweights and time windows (TD-OPSWTW). It focused on two types of learning\napproaches: surrogate-based optimization and deep reinforcement learning. In\nthis paper, we describe the problem, the setup of the competition, the winning\nmethods, and give an overview of the results. The winning methods described in\nthis work have advanced the state-of-the-art in using AI for stochastic routing\nproblems. Overall, by organizing this competition we have introduced routing\nproblems as an interesting problem setting for AI researchers. The simulator of\nthe problem has been made open-source and can be used by other researchers as a\nbenchmark for new AI methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper refines the existing axiomatic semantics of digital circuits with\ndelay and feedback, in which circuits are constructed as morphisms in a freely\ngenerated cartesian traced (dataflow) category. First, we give a cleaner\npresentation, making a clearer distinction between syntax and semantics,\nincluding a full formalisation of the semantics as stream functions. As part of\nthis effort, we refocus the categorical framework through the lens of string\ndiagrams, which not only makes reading equations more intuitive but removes\nbureaucracy such as associativity from proofs. We also extend the existing\nframework with a new axiom, inspired by the Kleene fixed-point theorem, which\nallows circuits with non-delay-guarded feedback, typically handled poorly by\ntraditional methodologies, to be replaced with a series of finitely iterated\ncircuits. This eliminates the possibility of infinitely unfolding a circuit;\ninstead, one can always reduce a circuit to some (possibly undefined) value. To\nfully characterise the stream functions that correspond to digital circuits, we\nexamine how the behaviour of the latter can be modelled using Mealy machines.\nBy establishing that the translation between sequential circuits and Mealy\nmachines preserves their behaviour, one can observe that circuits always\nimplement monotone stream functions with finite stream derivatives.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, image\ngeneration based on deep learning has dramatically advanced. Image generation\nbased on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a promising study. However,\nsince convolutions are limited by spatial-agnostic and channel-specific,\nfeatures extracted by traditional GANs based on convolution are constrained.\nTherefore, GANs are unable to capture any more details per image. On the other\nhand, straightforwardly stacking of convolutions causes too many parameters and\nlayers in GANs, which will lead to a high risk of overfitting. To overcome the\naforementioned limitations, in this paper, we propose a new GANs called\nInvolution Generative Adversarial Networks (GIU-GANs). GIU-GANs leverages a\nbrand new module called the Global Information Utilization (GIU) module, which\nintegrates Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) and involution to focus on\nglobal information by channel attention mechanism, leading to a higher quality\nof generated images. Meanwhile, Batch Normalization(BN) inevitably ignores the\nrepresentation differences among noise sampled by the generator, and thus\ndegrade the generated image quality. Thus we introduce Representative Batch\nNormalization(RBN) to the GANs architecture for this issue. The CIFAR-10 and\nCelebA datasets are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmodel. A large number of experiments prove that our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art competitive performance.",

    "abstract": "Code-based cryptography is one of the main propositions for the post-quantum\ncryptographic context, and several protocols of this kind have been submitted\non the NIST platform. Among them, BIKE and HQC are part of the five alternate\ncandidates selected in the third round of the NIST standardization process in\nthe KEM category. These two schemes make use of multiplication of large\npolynomials over binary rings, and due to the polynomial size (from 10,000 to\n60,000 bits), this operation is one of the costliest during key generation,\nencapsulation, or decapsulation mechanisms. In this work, we revisit the\ndifferent existing constant-time algorithms for arbitrary polynomial\nmultiplication. We explore the different Karatsuba and Toom-Cook constructions\nin order to determine the best combinations for each polynomial degree range,\nin the context of AVX2 and AVX512 instruction sets. This leads to different\nkernels and constructions in each case. In particular, in the context of\nAVX512, we use the VPCLMULQDQ instruction, which is a vectorized binary\npolynomial multiplication instruction. This instruction deals with up to four\npolynomial (of degree up to 63) multiplications, the four results being stored\nin one single 512-bit word. This allows to divide by roughly 3 the retired\ninstruction number of the operation in comparison with the AVX2 instruction set\nimplementations, while the speedup is up to 39% in terms of processor clock\ncycles. These results are different than the ones estimated in Drucker (Fast\nmultiplication of binary polynomials with the forthcoming vectorized vpclmulqdq\ninstruction, 2018). To illustrate the benefit of the new VPCLMULQDQ\ninstruction, we used the HQC code to evaluate our approaches. When implemented\nin the HQC protocol, for the security levels 128, 192, and 256, our approaches\nprovide up to 12% speedup, for key pair generation.",

    "abstract": "In many scenarios, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aka drones, need to have\nthe capability of autonomous flying to carry out their mission successfully. In\norder to allow these autonomous flights, drones need to know their location\nconstantly. Then, based on the current position and the final destination,\nnavigation commands will be generated and drones will be guided to their\ndestination. Localization can be easily carried out in outdoor environments\nusing GPS signals and drone inertial measurement units (IMUs). However, such an\napproach is not feasible in indoor environments or GPS-denied areas. In this\npaper, we propose a localization scheme for drones called PILOT (High-Precision\nIndoor Localization for Autonomous Drones) that is specifically designed for\nindoor environments. PILOT relies on ultrasonic acoustic signals to estimate\nthe target drone's location. In order to have a precise final estimation of the\ndrone's location, PILOT deploys a three-stage localization scheme. The first\ntwo stages provide robustness against the multi-path fading effect of indoor\nenvironments and mitigate the ranging error. Then, in the third stage, PILOT\ndeploys a simple yet effective technique to reduce the localization error\ninduced by the relative geometry between transmitters and receivers and\nsignificantly reduces the height estimation error. The performance of PILOT was\nassessed under different scenarios and the results indicate that PILOT achieves\ncentimeter-level accuracy for three-dimensional localization of drones.",

    "abstract": "Generating learning-friendly representations for points in a 2D space is a\nfundamental and long-standing problem in machine learning. Recently,\nmulti-scale encoding schemes (such as Space2Vec) were proposed to directly\nencode any point in 2D space as a high-dimensional vector, and has been\nsuccessfully applied to various (geo)spatial prediction tasks. However, a map\nprojection distortion problem rises when applying location encoding models to\nlarge-scale real-world GPS coordinate datasets (e.g., species images taken all\nover the world) - all current location encoding models are designed for\nencoding points in a 2D (Euclidean) space but not on a spherical surface, e.g.,\nearth surface. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-scale location\nencoding model called Sphere2V ec which directly encodes point coordinates on a\nspherical surface while avoiding the mapprojection distortion problem. We\nprovide theoretical proof that the Sphere2Vec encoding preserves the spherical\nsurface distance between any two points. We also developed a unified view of\ndistance-reserving encoding on spheres based on the Double Fourier Sphere\n(DFS). We apply Sphere2V ec to the geo-aware image classification task. Our\nanalysis shows that Sphere2V ec outperforms other 2D space location encoder\nmodels especially on the polar regions and data-sparse areas for image\nclassification tasks because of its nature for spherical surface distance\npreservation.",

    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization lies at the core of many real-world problems.\nEspecially since the rise of graph neural networks (GNNs), the deep learning\ncommunity has been developing solvers that derive solutions to NP-hard problems\nby learning the problem-specific solution structure. However, reproducing the\nresults of these publications proves to be difficult. We make three\ncontributions. First, we present an open-source benchmark suite for the NP-hard\nMaximum Independent Set problem, in both its weighted and unweighted variants.\nThe suite offers a unified interface to various state-of-the-art traditional\nand machine learning-based solvers. Second, using our benchmark suite, we\nconduct an in-depth analysis of the popular guided tree search algorithm by Li\net al. [NeurIPS 2018], testing various configurations on small and large\nsynthetic and real-world graphs. By re-implementing their algorithm with a\nfocus on code quality and extensibility, we show that the graph convolution\nnetwork used in the tree search does not learn a meaningful representation of\nthe solution structure, and can in fact be replaced by random values. Instead,\nthe tree search relies on algorithmic techniques like graph kernelization to\nfind good solutions. Thus, the results from the original publication are not\nreproducible. Third, we extend the analysis to compare the tree search\nimplementations to other solvers, showing that the classical algorithmic\nsolvers often are faster, while providing solutions of similar quality.\nAdditionally, we analyze a recent solver based on reinforcement learning and\nobserve that for this solver, the GNN is responsible for the competitive\nsolution quality.",

Yet, analyzing\nthese systems is a research gap, and developing effective ML-based MDSs is\nstill an open issue.

However, many\nexisting pruning solutions are based on unstructured pruning, which yield\nmodels that cannot efficiently run on commodity hardware, and require users to\nmanually explore and tune the pruning process, which is time consuming and\noften leads to sub-optimal results. To address these limitations, this paper\npresents an adaptive, activation-based, structured pruning approach to\nautomatically and efficiently generate small, accurate, and hardware-efficient\nmodels that meet user requirements. First, it proposes iterative structured\npruning using activation-based attention feature maps to effectively identify\nand prune unimportant filters.

A comprehensive evaluation\nshows that the proposed method can substantially outperform the\nstate-of-the-art structured pruning works on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.\nFor example, on ResNet-56 with CIFAR-10, without any accuracy drop, our method\nachieves the largest parameter reduction (79.11%), outperforming the related\nworks by 22.81% to 66.07%, and the largest FLOPs reduction (70.13%),\noutperforming the related works by 14.13% to 26.53%.",

    "abstract": "It is nowadays widely acknowledged that optimal structural design should be\nrobust with respect to the uncertainties in loads and material parameters.\nHowever, there are several alternatives to consider such uncertainties in\nstructural optimization problems. This paper presents a comprehensive\ncomparison between the results of three different approaches to topology\noptimization under uncertain loading, considering stress constraints: 1) the\nrobust formulation, which requires only the mean and standard deviation of\nstresses at each element; 2) the reliability-based formulation, which imposes a\nreliability constraint on computed stresses; 3) the non-probabilistic\nformulation, which considers a worst-case scenario for the stresses caused by\nuncertain loads. The information required by each method, regarding the\nuncertain loads, and the uncertainty propagation approach used in each case is\nquite different. The robust formulation requires only mean and standard\ndeviation of uncertain loads; stresses are computed via a first-order\nperturbation approach. The reliability-based formulation requires full\nprobability distributions of random loads, reliability constraints are computed\nvia a first-order performance measure approach. The non-probabilistic\nformulation is applicable for bounded uncertain loads; only lower and upper\nbounds are used, and worst-case stresses are computed via a nested optimization\nwith anti-optimization. The three approaches are quite different in the\nhandling of uncertainties; however, the basic topology optimization framework\nis the same: the traditional density approach is employed for material\nparameterization, while the augmented Lagrangian method is employed to solve\nthe resulting problem, in order to handle the large number of stress\nconstraints.",

While pure\nrecommendation performance often correlates with user satisfaction,\nexplainability has a positive impact on other factors such as trust and\nforgiveness, which are ultimately essential to maintain user loyalty.\nIn this article, we discuss how explainability can be addressed in the\ncontext of MRSs. We provide perspectives on how explainability could improve\nmusic recommendation algorithms and enhance user experience. First, we review\ncommon dimensions and goals of recommenders' explainability and in general of\neXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and elaborate on the extent to which\nthese apply -- or need to be adapted -- to the specific characteristics of\nmusic consumption and recommendation. Then, we show how explainability\ncomponents can be integrated within a MRS and in what form explanations can be\nprovided. Since the evaluation of explanation quality is decoupled from pure\naccuracy-based evaluation criteria, we also discuss requirements and strategies\nfor evaluating explanations of music recommendations. Finally, we describe the\ncurrent challenges for introducing explainability within a large-scale\nindustrial music recommender system and provide research perspectives.",

    "title": "HOLL: Program Synthesis for Higher OrderLogic Locking",
    "abstract": "Logic locking \"hides\" the functionality of a digital circuit to protect it\nfrom counterfeiting, piracy, and malicious design modifications. The original\ndesign is transformed into a \"locked\" design such that the circuit reveals its\ncorrect functionality only when it is \"unlocked\" with a secret sequence of\nbits--the key bit-string. However, strong attacks, especially the SAT attack\nthat uses a SAT solver to recover the key bitstring, have been profoundly\neffective at breaking the locked circuit and recovering the circuit\nfunctionality.\nWe lift logic locking to Higher Order Logic Locking (HOLL) by hiding a\nhigher-order relation, instead of a key of independent values, challenging the\nattacker to discover this key relation to recreate the circuit functionality.\nOur technique uses program synthesis to construct the locked design and\nsynthesize a corresponding key relation. HOLL has low overhead and existing\nattacks for logic locking do not apply as the entity to be recovered is no more\na value. To evaluate our proposal, we propose a new attack (SynthAttack) that\nuses an inductive synthesis algorithm guided by an operational circuit as an\ninput-output oracle to recover the hidden functionality. SynthAttack is\ninspired by the SAT attack, and similar to the SAT attack, it is verifiably\ncorrect, i.e., if the correct functionality is revealed, a verification check\nguarantees the same. Our empirical analysis shows that SynthAttack can break\nHOLL for small circuits and small key relations, but it is ineffective for\nreal-life designs.",

    "abstract": "In mutualistic cooperative ambient backscatter communications (AmBC),\nInternet-of-Things (IoT) device sends its information to a desired receiver by\nmodulating and backscattering the primary signal, while providing beneficial\nmultipath diversity to the primary receiver in return, thus forming a mutualism\nrelationship between the AmBC and primary links. We note that the hardware\nimpairments (HIs), which are unavoidable in practical systems and may\nsignificantly affect the transmission rates of the primary and AmBC links and\ntheir mutualism relationships, have been largely ignored in the study of\nmutualistic cooperative AmBC networks. In this paper, we consider a mutualistic\ncooperative AmBC network under HIs, and study the impacts of HIs on the\nachievable rates of the primary link and the AmBC link. In particular, we\ntheoretically prove that although HIs degrades the rate of each link, the\nmutualism relationship between the AmBC and primary links is maintained, i.e.,\nthe rate of the primary link in the mutualistic cooperative AmBC network is\nstill higher than that without the AmBC link. The closed-form rate expressions\nof both the AmBC and primary links are derived. Computer simulations are\nprovided to validate our theoretical analysis.",

    "abstract": "In acoustic signal processing, the target signals usually carry semantic\ninformation, which is encoded in a hierarchal structure of short and long-term\ncontexts. However, the background noise distorts these structures in a\nnonuniform way. The existing deep acoustic signal enhancement (ASE)\narchitectures ignore this kind of local and global effect. To address this\nproblem, we propose to integrate a novel temporal attentive-pooling (TAP)\nmechanism into a conventional convolutional recurrent neural network, termed as\nTAP-CRNN. The proposed approach considers both global and local attention for\nASE tasks. Specifically, we first utilize a convolutional layer to extract\nlocal information of the acoustic signals and then a recurrent neural network\n(RNN) architecture is used to characterize temporal contextual information.\nSecond, we exploit a novelattention mechanism to contextually process salient\nregions of the noisy signals. The proposed ASE system is evaluated using a\nbenchmark infant cry dataset and compared with several well-known methods. It\nis shown that the TAPCRNN can more effectively reduce noise components from\ninfant cry signals in unseen background noises at challenging signal-to-noise\nlevels.",

Information encoding and learning in neural\ncircuits depend on how well time-varying stimuli can control spontaneous\nnetwork activity. We show that in firing-rate networks in the balanced state,\nexternal control of recurrent dynamics, i.e., the suppression of\ninternally-generated chaotic variability, strongly depends on correlations in\nthe input. A unique feature of balanced networks is that, because common\nexternal input is dynamically canceled by recurrent feedback, it is far easier\nto suppress chaos with independent inputs into each neuron than through common\ninput. To study this phenomenon we develop a non-stationary dynamic mean-field\ntheory that determines how the activity statistics and largest Lyapunov\nexponent depend on frequency and amplitude of the input, recurrent coupling\nstrength, and network size, for both common and independent input.

In the acoustic domain, signal cross-correlation is a natural\nchoice to quantify the usefulness of microphone signals, i. e., microphone\nutility, for array processing, but its estimation requires that the uncoded\nsignals are synchronized and transmitted between nodes. In resource-constrained\nenvironments like acoustic sensor networks, low data transmission rates often\nmake transmission of all observed signals to the centralized location\ninfeasible, thus discouraging direct estimation of signal cross-correlation.\nInstead, we employ characteristic features of the recorded signals to estimate\nthe usefulness of individual microphone signals. In this contribution, we\nprovide a comprehensive analysis of model-based microphone utility estimation\napproaches that use signal features and, as an alternative, also propose\nmachine learning-based estimation methods that identify optimal sensor signal\nutility features.

    "title": "Improving non-autoregressive end-to-end speech recognition with  pre-trained acoustic and language models",
    "abstract": "While Transformers have achieved promising results in end-to-end (E2E)\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR), their autoregressive (AR) structure becomes\na bottleneck for speeding up the decoding process. For real-world deployment,\nASR systems are desired to be highly accurate while achieving fast inference.\nNon-autoregressive (NAR) models have become a popular alternative due to their\nfast inference speed, but they still fall behind AR systems in recognition\naccuracy. To fulfill the two demands, in this paper, we propose a NAR\nCTC/attention model utilizing both pre-trained acoustic and language models:\nwav2vec2.0 and BERT. To bridge the modality gap between speech and text\nrepresentations obtained from the pre-trained models, we design a novel\nmodality conversion mechanism, which is more suitable for logographic\nlanguages. During inference, we employ a CTC branch to generate a target\nlength, which enables the BERT to predict tokens in parallel. We also design a\ncache-based CTC/attention joint decoding method to improve the recognition\naccuracy while keeping the decoding speed fast. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed NAR model greatly outperforms our strong wav2vec2.0 CTC baseline\n(15.1% relative CER reduction on AISHELL-1). The proposed NAR model\nsignificantly surpasses previous NAR systems on the AISHELL-1 benchmark and\nshows a potential for English tasks.",

    "abstract": "A streaming style inference of encoder-decoder automatic speech recognition\n(ASR) system is important for reducing latency, which is essential for\ninteractive use cases. To this end, we propose a novel blockwise synchronous\ndecoding algorithm with a hybrid approach that combines endpoint prediction and\nendpoint post-determination. In the endpoint prediction, we compute the\nexpectation of the number of tokens that are yet to be emitted in the encoder\nfeatures of the current blocks using the CTC posterior. Based on the\nexpectation value, the decoder predicts the endpoint to realize continuous\nblock synchronization, as a running stitch. Meanwhile, endpoint\npost-determination probabilistically detects backward jump of the source-target\nattention, which is caused by the misprediction of endpoints. Then it resumes\ndecoding by discarding those hypotheses, as back stitch. We combine these\nmethods into a hybrid approach, namely run-and-back stitch search, which\nreduces the computational cost and latency. Evaluations of various ASR tasks\nshow the efficiency of our proposed decoding algorithm, which achieves a\nlatency reduction, for instance in the Librispeech test set from 1487 ms to 821\nms at the 90th percentile, while maintaining a high recognition accuracy.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new approach for speech pre-training named SPIRAL which works\nby learning denoising representation of perturbed data in a teacher-student\nframework. Specifically, given a speech utterance, we first feed the utterance\nto a teacher network to obtain corresponding representation. Then the same\nutterance is perturbed and fed to a student network. The student network is\ntrained to output representation resembling that of the teacher. At the same\ntime, the teacher network is updated as moving average of student's weights\nover training steps. In order to prevent representation collapse, we apply an\nin-utterance contrastive loss as pre-training objective and impose position\nrandomization on the input to the teacher. SPIRAL achieves competitive or\nbetter results compared to state-of-the-art speech pre-training method wav2vec\n2.0, with significant reduction of training cost (80% for Base model, 65% for\nLarge model). Furthermore, we address the problem of noise-robustness that is\ncritical to real-world speech applications. We propose multi-condition\npre-training by perturbing the student's input with various types of additive\nnoise. We demonstrate that multi-condition pre-trained SPIRAL models are more\nrobust to noisy speech (9.0% - 13.3% relative word error rate reduction on real\nnoisy test data), compared to applying multi-condition training solely in the\nfine-tuning stage. The code will be released after publication.",

    "title": "Addressing the Intra-class Mode Collapse Problem using Adaptive Input  Image Normalization in GAN-based X-ray Images",
    "abstract": "Biomedical image datasets can be imbalanced due to the rarity of targeted\ndiseases. Generative Adversarial Networks play a key role in addressing this\nimbalance by enabling the generation of synthetic images to augment and balance\ndatasets. It is important to generate synthetic images that incorporate a\ndiverse range of features such that they accurately represent the distribution\nof features present in the training imagery. Furthermore, the absence of\ndiverse features in synthetic images can degrade the performance of machine\nlearning classifiers. The mode collapse problem can impact a Generative\nAdversarial Network's capacity to generate diversified images. The mode\ncollapse comes in two varieties; intra-class and inter-class. In this paper,\nthe intra-class mode collapse problem is investigated, and its subsequent\nimpact on the diversity of synthetic X-ray images is evaluated. This work\ncontributes an empirical demonstration of the benefits of integrating the\nadaptive input-image normalization for the Deep Convolutional GAN to alleviate\nthe intra-class mode collapse problem. Results demonstrate that the DCGAN with\nadaptive input-image normalization outperforms DCGAN with un-normalized X-ray\nimages as evident by the superior diversity scores.",

    "abstract": "Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are ideal\ndemand-side flexible resources to provide regulation services. However, finding\nthe best hourly regulation capacity offers for HVAC systems in a power market\nahead of time is challenging because they are affected by non-Gaussian\nuncertainties from regulation signals. Moreover, since HVAC systems need to\nfrequently regulate their power according to regulation signals, numerous\nthermodynamic constraints are introduced, leading to a huge computational\nburden. This paper proposes a tractable chance-constrained model to address\nthese challenges. It first develops a temporal compression approach, in which\nthe extreme indoor temperatures in the operating hour are estimated and\nrestricted in the comfortable range so that the numerous thermodynamic\nconstraints can be compressed into only a few ones. Then, a novel\nconvexification method is proposed to handle the non-Gaussian uncertainties.\nThis method leverages the Gaussian mixture model to reformulate the chance\nconstraints with non-Gaussian uncertainties on the left-hand side into\ndeterministic non-convex forms. We further prove that these non-convex forms\ncan be approximately convexified by second-order cone constraints with marginal\noptimality loss. Therefore, the proposed model can be efficiently solved with\nguaranteed optimality. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Chance-constrained programming (CCP) is a promising approach to handle\nuncertainties in optimal power flow (OPF). However, conventional CCP usually\nassumes that uncertainties follow Gaussian distributions, which may not match\nreality. A few papers employed the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to extend CCP\nto cases with non-Gaussian uncertainties, but they are only appropriate for\ncases with uncertainties on the right-hand side but not applicable to DC OPF\nthat containing left-hand side uncertainties. To address this, we develop a\ntractable GMM-based chance-constrained DC OPF model. In this model, we not only\nleverage GMM to capture the probability characteristics of non-Gaussian\ndistributed uncertainties, but also develop a linearization technique to\nreformulate the chance constraints with non-Gaussian distributed uncertainties\non the left-hand side into tractable forms. A mathematical proof is further\nprovided to demonstrate that the corresponding reformulation is a safe\napproximation of the original problem, which guarantees the feasibility of\nsolutions.",

    "abstract": "Computed tomography is widely used as an imaging tool to visualize\nthree-dimensional structures with expressive bone-soft tissue contrast.\nHowever, CT resolution and radiation dose are tightly entangled, highlighting\nthe importance of low-dose CT combined with sophisticated denoising algorithms.\nMost data-driven denoising techniques are based on deep neural networks and,\ntherefore, contain hundreds of thousands of trainable parameters, making them\nincomprehensible and prone to prediction failures. Developing understandable\nand robust denoising algorithms achieving state-of-the-art performance helps to\nminimize radiation dose while maintaining data integrity. This work presents an\nopen-source CT denoising framework based on the idea of bilateral filtering. We\npropose a bilateral filter that can be incorporated into a deep learning\npipeline and optimized in a purely data-driven way by calculating the gradient\nflow toward its hyperparameters and its input. Denoising in pure image-to-image\npipelines and across different domains such as raw detector data and\nreconstructed volume, using a differentiable backprojection layer, is\ndemonstrated. Although only using three spatial parameters and one range\nparameter per filter layer, the proposed denoising pipelines can compete with\ndeep state-of-the-art denoising architectures with several hundred thousand\nparameters. Competitive denoising performance is achieved on x-ray microscope\nbone data (0.7053 and 33.10) and the 2016 Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset\n(0.9674 and 43.07) in terms of SSIM and PSNR.

    "abstract": "Synthetic biology and bioengineering provide the opportunity to create novel\nembodied cognitive systems (otherwise known as minds) in a very wide variety of\nchimeric architectures combining evolved and designed material and software.\nThese advances are disrupting familiar concepts in the philosophy of mind, and\nrequire new ways of thinking about and comparing truly diverse intelligences,\nwhose composition and origin are not like any of the available natural model\nspecies. In this Perspective, I introduce TAME - Technological Approach to Mind\nEverywhere - a framework for understanding and manipulating cognition in\nunconventional substrates. TAME formalizes a non-binary (continuous),\nempirically-based approach to strongly embodied agency. When applied to\nregenerating/developmental systems, TAME suggests a perspective on\nmorphogenesis as an example of basal cognition. The deep symmetry between\nproblem-solving in anatomical, physiological, transcriptional, and 3D\n(traditional behavioral) spaces drives specific hypotheses by which cognitive\ncapacities can scale during evolution. An important medium exploited by\nevolution for joining active subunits into greater agents is developmental\nbioelectricity, implemented by pre-neural use of ion channels and gap junctions\nto scale cell-level feedback loops into anatomical homeostasis. This\narchitecture of multi-scale competency of biological systems has important\nimplications for plasticity of bodies and minds, greatly potentiating\nevolvability. Considering classical and recent data from the perspectives of\ncomputational science, evolutionary biology, and basal cognition, reveals a\nrich research program with many implications for cognitive science,\nevolutionary biology, regenerative medicine, and artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Radar sensors are crucial for environment perception of driver assistance\nsystems as well as autonomous vehicles. With a rising number of radar sensors\nand the so far unregulated automotive radar frequency band, mutual interference\nis inevitable and must be dealt with. Algorithms and models operating on radar\ndata are required to run the early processing steps on specialized radar sensor\nhardware. This specialized hardware typically has strict resource-constraints,\ni.e. a low memory capacity and low computational power. Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN)-based approaches for denoising and interference mitigation yield\npromising results for radar processing in terms of performance. Regarding\nresource-constraints, however, CNNs typically exceed the hardware's capacities\nby far.\nIn this paper we investigate quantization techniques for CNN-based denoising\nand interference mitigation of radar signals. We analyze the quantization of\n(i) weights and (ii) activations of different CNN-based model architectures.\nThis quantization results in reduced memory requirements for model storage and\nduring inference. We compare models with fixed and learned bit-widths and\ncontrast two different methodologies for training quantized CNNs, i.e. the\nstraight-through gradient estimator and training distributions over discrete\nweights. We illustrate the importance of structurally small real-valued base\nmodels for quantization and show that learned bit-widths yield the smallest\nmodels. We achieve a memory reduction of around 80\\% compared to the\nreal-valued baseline.

    "abstract": "With recent advancements in voice cloning, the performance of speech\nsynthesis for a target speaker has been rendered similar to the human level.\nHowever, autoregressive voice cloning systems still suffer from text alignment\nfailures, resulting in an inability to synthesize long sentences. In this work,\nwe propose a variant of attention-based text-to-speech system that can\nreproduce a target voice from a few seconds of reference speech and generalize\nto very long utterances as well. The proposed system is based on three\nindependently trained components: a speaker encoder, synthesizer and universal\nvocoder. Generalization to long utterances is realized using an energy-based\nattention mechanism known as Dynamic Convolution Attention, in combination with\na set of modifications proposed for the synthesizer based on Tacotron 2.\nMoreover, effective zero-shot speaker adaptation is achieved by conditioning\nboth the synthesizer and vocoder on a speaker encoder that has been pretrained\non a large corpus of diverse data. We compare several implementations of voice\ncloning systems in terms of speech naturalness, speaker similarity, alignment\nconsistency and ability to synthesize long utterances, and conclude that the\nproposed model can produce intelligible synthetic speech for extremely long\nutterances, while preserving a high extent of naturalness and similarity for\nshort texts.",

In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for segmenting\ncalcified and non-calcified plaques in CCTA-CPR scans of coronary arteries.

To this end, here we\npresent a Bayesian deep learning approach for spatio-temporal modelling of\nenvironmental variables with automatic outlier detection. Our approach\nimplements a Gaussian-uniform mixture density network whose dual purposes -\nmodelling the phenomenon of interest, and learning to classify and ignore\noutliers - are achieved simultaneously, each by specifically designed branches\nof our neural network. For our example application, we use the Met Office's\nWeather Observation Website data, an archive of observations from around 1900\nprivately run and unofficial weather stations across the British Isles. Using\ndata on surface air temperature, we demonstrate how our deep mixture model\napproach enables the modelling of a highly skilled spatio-temporal temperature\ndistribution without contamination from spurious observations. We hope that\nadoption of our approach will help unlock the potential of incorporating a\nwider range of observation sources, including from crowd sourcing, into future\nenvironmental models.",

    "abstract": "We study the optimal sample complexity of learning a Gaussian directed\nacyclic graph (DAG) from observational data. Our main result establishes the\nminimax optimal sample complexity for learning the structure of a linear\nGaussian DAG model with equal variances to be $n\\asymp q\\log(d/q)$, where $q$\nis the maximum number of parents and $d$ is the number of nodes. We further\nmake comparisons with the classical problem of learning (undirected) Gaussian\ngraphical models, showing that under the equal variance assumption, these two\nproblems share the same optimal sample complexity. In other words, at least for\nGaussian models with equal error variances, learning a directed graphical model\nis not more difficult than learning an undirected graphical model. Our results\nalso extend to more general identification assumptions as well as subgaussian\nerrors.",
