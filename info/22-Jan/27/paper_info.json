    "abstract": "To interact with humans, artificial intelligence (AI) systems must understand\nour social world. Within this world norms play an important role in motivating\nand guiding agents. However, very few computational theories for learning\nsocial norms have been proposed. There also exists a long history of debate on\nthe distinction between what is normal (is) and what is normative (ought). Many\nhave argued that being capable of learning both concepts and recognizing the\ndifference is necessary for all social agents. This paper introduces and\ndemonstrates a computational approach to learning norms from natural language\ntext that accounts for both what is normal and what is normative. It provides a\nfoundation for everyday people to train AI systems about social norms.",

    "title": "Automating Safety and Security Co-Design through Semantically-Rich  Architectural Patterns",
    "abstract": "During the design of safety-critical systems, safety and security engineers\nmake use of architectural patterns, such as Watchdog and Firewall, to address\nidentified failures and threats. Often, however, the deployment of safety\npatterns has consequences on security, e.g., the deployment of a safety pattern\nmay lead to new threats. The other way around may also be possible, i.e., the\ndeployment of a security pattern may lead to new failures. Safety and security\nco-design is, therefore, required to understand such consequences and\ntrade-offs, in order to reach appropriate system designs. Currently, pattern\ndescriptions, including their consequences, are described using natural\nlanguage. Therefore, their deployment in system design is carried out manually,\nthus time-consuming and prone to human-error, especially given the high system\ncomplexity. We propose the use of semantically-rich architectural patterns to\nenable automated support for safety and security co-design by using Knowledge\nRepresentation and Reasoning (KRR) methods. Based on our domain-specific\nlanguage, we specify reasoning principles as logic specifications written as\nanswer-set programs. KRR engines enable the automation of safety and security\nco-engineering activities, including the automated recommendation of which\narchitectural patterns can address failures or threats and consequences of\ndeploying such patterns. We demonstrate our approach on an example taken from\nthe ISO 21434 standard.",

    "abstract": "This work considers the coded caching problem with shared caches, where users\nshare the caches, and each user gets access only to one cache. The\nuser-to-cache association is assumed to be known at the server during the\nplacement phase. We focus on the schemes derived using placement delivery\narrays (PDAs). The PDAs were originally designed to address the\nsub-packetization bottleneck of coded caching in a dedicated cache setup. We\nobserve that in the setup of this paper permuting the columns of the PDA\nresults in schemes with different performance for the same problem, but the\nsub-packetization level remains the same. This is contrary to what was observed\nfor dedicated cache networks. We propose a procedure to identify the ordering\nof columns that gives the best performance possible for the PDA employed for\nthe given problem. Further, some specific classes of PDAs are chosen and the\nperformance gain achieved by reordering the columns of the PDA is illustrated.",

    "abstract": "The pre-trained language model (eg, BERT) based deep retrieval models\nachieved superior performance over lexical retrieval models (eg, BM25) in many\npassage retrieval tasks. However, limited work has been done to generalize a\ndeep retrieval model to other tasks and domains. In this work, we carefully\nselect five datasets, including two in-domain datasets and three out-of-domain\ndatasets with different levels of domain shift, and study the generalization of\na deep model in a zero-shot setting. Our findings show that the performance of\na deep retrieval model is significantly deteriorated when the target domain is\nvery different from the source domain that the model was trained on. On the\ncontrary, lexical models are more robust across domains. We thus propose a\nsimple yet effective framework to integrate lexical and deep retrieval models.\nOur experiments demonstrate that these two models are complementary, even when\nthe deep model is weaker in the out-of-domain setting. The hybrid model obtains\nan average of 20.4% relative gain over the deep retrieval model, and an average\nof 9.54% over the lexical model in three out-of-domain datasets.",

In the problem setting, the server has a library of $N$ files, and\neach user is equipped with a dedicated cache of capacity $M$. The idea of\nextended placement delivery array (EPDA), an array which consists of a special\nsymbol $\\star$ and integers in a set $\\{1,2,\\dots,S\\}$, is proposed to obtain a\nnovel solution for the aforementioned multi-antenna coded caching problem.

The\nplacement delivery array (for single-antenna coded caching scheme) is a special\nclass of EPDAs with $L=1$. For the multi-antenna coded caching schemes\nconstructed from EPDAs, it is shown that the maximum possible Degree of Freedom\n(DoF) that can be achieved is $t+L$, where $t=\\frac{KM}{N}$ is an integer.\nFurthermore, two constructions of EPDAs are proposed: a) $ K=t+L$, and b)\n$K=nt+(n-1)L, \\hspace{0.1cm}L\\geq t$, where $n\\geq 2$ is an integer.

    "abstract": "Keeping track of and managing Self-Admitted Technical Debts (SATDs) is\nimportant for maintaining a healthy software project. Current active-learning\nSATD recognition tool involves manual inspection of 24% of the test comments on\naverage to reach 90% of the recall. Among all the test comments, about 5% are\nSATDs. The human experts are then required to read almost a quintuple of the\nSATD comments which indicates the inefficiency of the tool. Plus, human experts\nare still prone to error: 95% of the false-positive labels from previous work\nwere actually true positives.\nTo solve the above problems, we propose DebtFree, a two-mode framework based\non unsupervised learning for identifying SATDs. In mode1, when the existing\ntraining data is unlabeled, DebtFree starts with an unsupervised learner to\nautomatically pseudo-label the programming comments in the training data. In\ncontrast, in mode2 where labels are available with the corresponding training\ndata, DebtFree starts with a pre-processor that identifies the highly prone\nSATDs from the test dataset. Then, our machine learning model is employed to\nassist human experts in manually identifying the remaining SATDs. Our\nexperiments on 10 software projects show that both models yield a statistically\nsignificant improvement in effectiveness over the state-of-the-art automated\nand semi-automated models. Specifically, DebtFree can reduce the labeling\neffort by 99% in mode1 (unlabeled training data), and up to 63% in mode2\n(labeled training data) while improving the current active learner's F1\nrelatively to almost 100%.",

    "abstract": "HTML documents are an important medium for disseminating information on the\nWeb for human consumption. An HTML document presents information in multiple\ntext formats including unstructured text, structured key-value pairs, and\ntables. Effective representation of these documents is essential for machine\nunderstanding to enable a wide range of applications, such as Question\nAnswering, Web Search, and Personalization. Existing work has either\nrepresented these documents using visual features extracted by rendering them\nin a browser, which is typically computationally expensive, or has simply\ntreated them as plain text documents, thereby failing to capture useful\ninformation presented in their HTML structure. We argue that the text and HTML\nstructure together convey important semantics of the content and therefore\nwarrant a special treatment for their representation learning. In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel representation learning approach for web pages, dubbed\nDOM-LM, which addresses the limitations of existing approaches by encoding both\ntext and DOM tree structure with a transformer-based encoder and learning\ngeneralizable representations for HTML documents via self-supervised\npre-training. We evaluate DOM-LM on a variety of webpage understanding tasks,\nincluding Attribute Extraction, Open Information Extraction, and Question\nAnswering.

At their heart, such analyses rely on\nfinite-state machines (FSMs) to specify important properties of an object.\nUnfortunately, many useful contracts are impractical to encode as FSMs and/or\ntheir associated FSMs have a prohibitively large number of states, which leads\nto sub-par performance for low-latency environments.\nTo address this bottleneck, we present a lightweight typestate analyzer,\nbased on a specification language that can succinctly specify code contracts\nwith significant expressivity. A central idea in our analysis is that using a\nclass of FSMs that can be expressed and analyzed as bit-vectors can unlock\nsubstantial performance improvements.\nWe validate this idea by implementing our lightweight typestate analyzer in\nthe industrial-strength static analyzer Infer. We show how our lightweight\napproach exhibits considerable performance and usability benefits when compared\nto existing techniques, including industrial-scale static analyzers.",

    "abstract": "Strategic behavior is a fundamental problem in a variety of real-world\napplications that require some form of peer assessment, such as peer grading of\nassignments, grant proposal review, conference peer review, and peer assessment\nof employees. Since an individual's own work is in competition with the\nsubmissions they are evaluating, they may provide dishonest evaluations to\nincrease the relative standing of their own submission. This issue is typically\naddressed by partitioning the individuals and assigning them to evaluate the\nwork of only those from different subsets. Although this method ensures\nstrategyproofness, each submission may require a different type of expertise\nfor effective evaluation. In this paper, we focus on finding an assignment of\nevaluators to submissions that maximizes assigned expertise subject to the\nconstraint of strategyproofness. We analyze the price of strategyproofness:\nthat is, the amount of compromise on the assignment quality required in order\nto get strategyproofness. We establish several polynomial-time algorithms for\nstrategyproof assignment along with assignment-quality guarantees. Finally, we\nevaluate the methods on a dataset from conference peer review.",

In the proposed\ncentralized multi-robot planner, a simultaneous matching and routing problem\n(SMRP) is formulated to match the humans with robot guides according to their\nselected places of interest (POIs) and generate the routes and schedules for\nthe robots according to uncertain spatial and time estimation. A large\nneighborhood search algorithm is developed to efficiently find sub-optimal\nlow-cost solutions for the SMRP. The scalability and optimality of the\nmulti-robot planner are evaluated computationally under different numbers of\nhumans, robots, and POIs. The largest case tested involves 50 robots, 250\nhumans, and 50 POIs. Then, a photo-realistic multi-robot simulation platform\nwas developed based on Habitat-AI to verify the tour guiding performance in an\nuncertain indoor environment. Results demonstrate that the proposed centralized\ntour planner is scalable, makes a smooth trade-off in the plans under different\nenvironmental constraints, and can lead to robust performance with inaccurate\nuncertainty estimations (within a certain margin).",

This paper introduces an invariant\nextended Kalman filter that estimates the robot's pose and velocity during DRS\nlocomotion by using common sensors of legged robots (e.g., inertial measurement\nunits (IMU), joint encoders, and RDB-D camera). A key feature of the filter\nlies in that it explicitly addresses the nonstationary surface-foot contact\npoint and the hybrid robot behaviors. Another key feature is that, in the\nabsence of IMU biases, the filter satisfies the attractive group affine and\ninvariant observation conditions, and is thus provably convergent for the\ndeterministic continuous phases. The observability analysis is performed to\nreveal the effects of DRS movement on the state observability, and the\nconvergence property of the hybrid, deterministic filter system is examined for\nthe observable state variables. Experiments of a Digit humanoid robot walking\non a pitching treadmill validate the effectiveness of the proposed filter under\nsensor noise and biases as well as large estimation errors and DRS movement.",

    "title": "SA-VQA: Structured Alignment of Visual and Semantic Representations for  Visual Question Answering",
    "abstract": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) attracts much attention from both industry\nand academia. As a multi-modality task, it is challenging since it requires not\nonly visual and textual understanding, but also the ability to align\ncross-modality representations. Previous approaches extensively employ\nentity-level alignments, such as the correlations between the visual regions\nand their semantic labels, or the interactions across question words and object\nfeatures. These attempts aim to improve the cross-modality representations,\nwhile ignoring their internal relations. Instead, we propose to apply\nstructured alignments, which work with graph representation of visual and\ntextual content, aiming to capture the deep connections between the visual and\ntextual modalities. Nevertheless, it is nontrivial to represent and integrate\ngraphs for structured alignments. In this work, we attempt to solve this issue\nby first converting different modality entities into sequential nodes and the\nadjacency graph, then incorporating them for structured alignments. As\ndemonstrated in our experimental results, such a structured alignment improves\nreasoning performance. In addition, our model also exhibits better\ninterpretability for each generated answer. The proposed model, without any\npretraining, outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on GQA dataset, and beats\nthe non-pretrained state-of-the-art methods on VQA-v2 dataset.",

    "abstract": "Date of birth (DOB) has historically been considered as private information\nand safe to use for authentication, but recent years have seen a shift towards\nwide public sharing. In this work we characterize how modern social media users\nare approaching the sharing of birthday wishes publicly online. Over 45 days,\nwe collected over 2.8M tweets wishing happy birthday to 724K Twitter accounts.\nFor 50K accounts, their age was likely mentioned revealing their DOB, and 10%\nwere protected accounts. Our findings show that the majority of both public and\nprotected accounts seem to be accepting of their birthdays and DOB being\nrevealed online by their friends even when they do not have it listed on their\nprofiles. We further complemented our findings through a survey to measure\nawareness of DOB disclosure issues and how people think about sharing different\ntypes of birthday-related information. Our analysis shows that giving birthday\nwishes to others online is considered a celebration and many users are quite\ncomfortable with it. This view matches the trend also seen in security where\nthe use of DOB in authentication process is no longer considered best practice.",

    "abstract": "Learning to answer visual questions is a challenging task since the\nmulti-modal inputs are within two feature spaces. Moreover, reasoning in visual\nquestion answering requires the model to understand both image and question,\nand align them in the same space, rather than simply memorize statistics about\nthe question-answer pairs. Thus, it is essential to find component connections\nbetween different modalities and within each modality to achieve better\nattention. Previous works learned attention weights directly on the features.\nHowever, the improvement is limited since these two modality features are in\ntwo domains: image features are highly diverse, lacking structure and\ngrammatical rules as language, and natural language features have a higher\nprobability of missing detailed information. To better learn the attention\nbetween visual and text, we focus on how to construct input stratification and\nembed structural information to improve the alignment between different level\ncomponents. We propose Multi-Granularity Alignment architecture for Visual\nQuestion Answering task (MGA-VQA), which learns intra- and inter-modality\ncorrelations by multi-granularity alignment, and outputs the final result by\nthe decision fusion module. In contrast to previous works, our model splits\nalignment into different levels to achieve learning better correlations without\nneeding additional data and annotations. The experiments on the VQA-v2 and GQA\ndatasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms non-pretrained\nstate-of-the-art methods on both datasets without extra pretraining data and\nannotations. Moreover, it even achieves better results over the pre-trained\nmethods on GQA.",

To\novercome this limitation, we propose employing a semi-supervised method, i.e.,\nvirtual adversarial training (VAT), to leverage and learn useful information\nunderlying in unlabeled data for better classification of breast masses.\nAccordingly, our VAT-based models have two types of losses, namely supervised\nand virtual adversarial losses. The former loss acts as in supervised\nclassification, while the latter loss aims at enhancing model robustness\nagainst virtual adversarial perturbation, thus improving model\ngeneralizability. To evaluate the performance of our VAT-based CAD scheme, we\nretrospectively assembled a total of 1024 breast mass images, with equal number\nof benign and malignant masses. A large CNN and a small CNN were used in this\ninvestigation, and both were trained with and without the adversarial loss.\nWhen the labeled ratios were 40% and 80%, VAT-based CNNs delivered the highest\nclassification accuracy of 0.740 and 0.760, respectively.

The recent\nattention to causal fairness, however, has been accompanied with great\nskepticism due to practical and epistemological challenges with applying\ncurrent causal fairness approaches in the literature. Motivated by the\nlong-standing empirical work on causality in econometrics, social sciences, and\nbiomedical sciences, in this paper we lay out the conditions for appropriate\napplication of causal fairness under the \"potential outcomes framework.\" We\nhighlight key aspects of causal inference that are often ignored in the causal\nfairness literature. In particular, we discuss the importance of specifying the\nnature and timing of interventions on social categories such as race or gender.\nPrecisely, instead of postulating an intervention on immutable attributes, we\npropose a shift in focus to their perceptions and discuss the implications for\nfairness evaluation. We argue that such conceptualization of the intervention\nis key in evaluating the validity of causal assumptions and conducting sound\ncausal analysis including avoiding post-treatment bias. Subsequently, we\nillustrate how causality can address the limitations of existing fairness\nmetrics, including those that depend upon statistical correlations.\nSpecifically, we introduce causal variants of common statistical notions of\nfairness, and we make a novel observation that under the causal framework there\nis no fundamental disagreement between different notions of fairness. Finally,\nwe conduct extensive experiments where we demonstrate our approach for\nevaluating and mitigating unfairness, specially when post-treatment variables\nare present.",

We\nextend this analysis to the 2-norm of the difference between the estimate and\nthe diagonal of $A$.

To fly completely or partially on their own, drones need access\nto location services to get navigation commands. While using the Global\nPositioning System (GPS) is an obvious choice, GPS is not always available, can\nbe spoofed or jammed, and is highly error-prone for indoor and underground\nenvironments. The ranging method using beacons is one of the popular methods\nfor localization, specially for indoor environments. In general, localization\nerror in this class is due to two factors: the ranging error and the error\ninduced by the relative geometry between the beacons and the target object to\nlocalize. This paper proposes OPTILOD (Optimal Beacon Placement for\nHigh-Accuracy Indoor Localization of Drones), an optimization algorithm for the\noptimal placement of beacons deployed in three-dimensional indoor environments.\nOPTILOD leverages advances in Evolutionary Algorithms to compute the minimum\nnumber of beacons and their optimal placement to minimize the localization\nerror. These problems belong to the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) class and\nare both considered NP-Hard. Despite that, OPTILOD can provide multiple optimal\nbeacon configurations that minimize the localization error and the number of\ndeployed beacons concurrently and time efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Voice conversion has made great progress in the past few years under the\nstudio-quality test scenario in terms of speech quality and speaker similarity.\nHowever, in real applications, test speech from source speaker or target\nspeaker can be corrupted by various environment noises, which seriously degrade\nthe speech quality and speaker similarity. In this paper, we propose a novel\nencoder-decoder based noise-robust voice conversion framework, which consists\nof a speaker encoder, a content encoder, a decoder, and two domain adversarial\nneural networks. Specifically, we integrate disentangling speaker and content\nrepresentation technique with domain adversarial training technique. Domain\nadversarial training makes speaker representations and content representations\nextracted by speaker encoder and content encoder from clean speech and noisy\nspeech in the same space, respectively. In this way, the learned speaker and\ncontent representations are noise-invariant. Therefore, the two noise-invariant\nrepresentations can be taken as input by the decoder to predict the clean\nconverted spectrum.

To this end, we leverage Monte\nCarlo light simulation over an accurate biophysical human skin layering model\nparameterized by its most important components, thereby covering a plausible\nrange of colors. The practical complexity of the model allows us to learn the\ninverse mapping from any albedo to its most probable associated skin\nproperties.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) achieves promising results on the challenging\nproblem of unsupervised anomaly detection (AD).The representation discrepancy\nof anomalies in the teacher-student (T-S) model provides essential evidence for\nAD. However, using similar or identical architectures to build the teacher and\nstudent models in previous studies hinders the diversity of anomalous\nrepresentations. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel T-S model\nconsisting of a teacher encoder and a student decoder and introduce a simple\nyet effective \"reverse distillation\" paradigm accordingly. Instead of receiving\nraw images directly, the student network takes teacher model's one-class\nembedding as input and targets to restore the teacher's multiscale\nrepresentations. Inherently, knowledge distillation in this study starts from\nabstract, high-level presentations to low-level features. In addition, we\nintroduce a trainable one-class bottleneck embedding (OCBE) module in our T-S\nmodel. The obtained compact embedding effectively preserves essential\ninformation on normal patterns, but abandons anomaly perturbations.

    "abstract": "Using an amalgamation of techniques from classical radar, computer vision,\nand deep learning, we characterize our ongoing data-driven approach to\nspace-time adaptive processing (STAP) radar. We generate a rich example dataset\nof received radar signals by randomly placing targets of variable strengths in\na predetermined region using RFView, a site-specific radio frequency modeling\nand simulation tool developed by ISL Inc. For each data sample within this\nregion, we generate heatmap tensors in range, azimuth, and elevation of the\noutput power of a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer,\nwhich can be replaced with a desired test statistic. These heatmap tensors can\nbe thought of as stacked images, and in an airborne scenario, the moving radar\ncreates a sequence of these time-indexed image stacks, resembling a video. Our\ngoal is to use these images and videos to detect targets and estimate their\nlocations, a procedure reminiscent of computer vision algorithms for object\ndetection$-$namely, the Faster Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network\n(Faster R-CNN). The Faster R-CNN consists of a proposal generating network for\ndetermining regions of interest (ROI), a regression network for positioning\nanchor boxes around targets, and an object classification algorithm; it is\ndeveloped and optimized for natural images. Our ongoing research will develop\nanalogous tools for heatmap images of radar data. In this regard, we will\ngenerate a large, representative adaptive radar signal processing database for\ntraining and testing, analogous in spirit to the COCO dataset for natural\nimages.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) has achieved substantial progress in\nrecent years. However, it is observed that the performances of self-labeling\nSSOD methods remain limited. Based on our experimental analysis, we reveal that\nthe reason behind such phenomenon lies in the mutual error amplification\nbetween the pseudo labels and the trained detector. In this study, we propose a\nCross Teaching (CT) method, aiming to mitigate the mutual error amplification\nby introducing a rectification mechanism of pseudo labels. CT simultaneously\ntrains multiple detectors with an identical structure but different parameter\ninitialization. In contrast to existing mutual teaching methods that directly\ntreat predictions from other detectors as pseudo labels, we propose the Label\nRectification Module (LRM), where the bounding boxes predicted by one detector\nare rectified by using the corresponding boxes predicted by all other detectors\nwith higher confidence scores. In this way, CT can enhance the pseudo label\nquality compared with self-labeling and existing mutual teaching methods, and\nreasonably mitigate the mutual error amplification. Over two popular detector\nstructures, i.e., SSD300 and Faster-RCNN-FPN, the proposed CT method obtains\nconsistent improvements and outperforms the state-of-the-art SSOD methods by\n2.2% absolute mAP improvements on the Pascal VOC and MS-COCO benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Transformers have made remarkable progress towards modeling long-range\ndependencies within the medical image analysis domain. However, current\ntransformer-based models suffer from several disadvantages: 1) existing methods\nfail to capture the important features of the images due to the naive\ntokenization scheme; 2) the models suffer from information loss because they\nonly consider single-scale feature representations; and 3) the segmentation\nlabel maps generated by the models are not accurate enough without considering\nrich semantic contexts and anatomical textures. In this work, we present\nCA-GANformer, a novel type of generative adversarial transformers, for medical\nimage segmentation. First, we take advantage of the pyramid structure to\nconstruct multi-scale representations and handle multi-scale variations. We\nthen design a novel class-aware transformer module to better learn the\ndiscriminative regions of objects with semantic structures. Lastly, we utilize\nan adversarial training strategy that boosts segmentation accuracy and\ncorrespondingly allows a transformer-based discriminator to capture high-level\nsemantically correlated contents and low-level anatomical features. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that CA-GANformer dramatically outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art transformer-based approaches on three benchmarks, obtaining\nabsolute 2.54%-5.88% improvements in Dice over previous models. Further\nqualitative experiments provide a more detailed picture of the model's inner\nworkings, shed light on the challenges in improved transparency, and\ndemonstrate that transfer learning can greatly improve performance and reduce\nthe size of medical image datasets in training, making CA-GANformer a strong\nstarting point for downstream medical image analysis tasks.

    "abstract": "The traditional two-state hidden Markov model divides the high frequency\ncoefficients only into two states (large and small states). Such scheme is\nprone to produce an inaccurate statistical model for the high frequency subband\nand reduces the quality of fusion result. In this paper, a fine-grained\nmulti-state contextual hidden Markov model (MCHMM) is proposed for infrared and\nvisible image fusion in the non-subsampled Shearlet domain, which takes full\nconsideration of the strong correlations and level of details of NSST\ncoefficients. To this end, an accurate soft context variable is designed\ncorrespondingly from the perspective of context correlation. Then, the\nstatistical features provided by MCHMM are utilized for the fusion of high\nfrequency subbands. To ensure the visual quality, a fusion strategy based on\nthe difference in regional energy is proposed as well for lowfrequency\nsubbands. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve\na superior performance compared with other fusion methods in both subjective\nand objective aspects.",

    "abstract": "Lane change for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is an important but challenging\ntask in complex dynamic traffic environments. Due to difficulties in guarantee\nsafety as well as a high efficiency, AVs are inclined to choose relatively\nconservative strategies for lane change. To avoid the conservatism, this paper\npresents a cooperation-aware lane change method utilizing interactions between\nvehicles. We first propose an interactive trajectory prediction method to\nexplore possible cooperations between an AV and the others. Further, an\nevaluation is designed to make a decision on lane change, in which safety,\nefficiency and comfort are taken into consideration. Thereafter, we propose a\nmotion planning algorithm based on model predictive control (MPC), which\nincorporates AV's decision and surrounding vehicles' interactive behaviors into\nconstraints so as to avoid collisions during lane change. Quantitative testing\nresults show that compared with the methods without an interactive prediction,\nour method enhances driving efficiencies of the AV and other vehicles by\n14.8$\\%$ and 2.6$\\%$ respectively, which indicates that a proper utilization of\nvehicle interactions can effectively reduce the conservatism of the AV and\npromote the cooperation between the AV and others.",

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes graph neural networks\nwith dynamic and static representations for social recommendation (GNN-DSR),\nwhich considers both dynamic and static representations of users and items and\nincorporates their relational influence. GNN-DSR models the short-term dynamic\nand long-term static interactional representations of the user's interest and\nthe item's attraction, respectively. Furthermore, the attention mechanism is\nused to aggregate the social influence of users on the target user and the\ncorrelative items' influence on a given item. The final latent factors of user\nand item are combined to make a prediction. Experiments on three real-world\nrecommender system datasets validate the effectiveness of GNN-DSR.",

This paper develops a novel image\ninpainting approach that enables users to customize the inpainting result by\ntheir own preference or memory. Specifically, our approach is composed of two\nstages that utilize the prior of neural network and user's guidance to jointly\ninpaint corrupted images. In the first stage, an autoencoder based on a novel\nexternal spatial attention mechanism is deployed to produce reconstructed\nfeatures of the corrupted image and a coarse inpainting result that provides\nsemantic mask as the medium for user interaction. In the second stage, a\nsemantic decoder that takes the reconstructed features as prior is adopted to\nsynthesize a fine inpainting result guided by user's customized semantic mask,\nso that the final inpainting result will share the same content with user's\nguidance while the textures and colors reconstructed in the first stage are\npreserved.

A colonel wins a battle if they\nassign more troops to that particular battle, and each colonel seeks to\nmaximize their total number of victories.\nDespite the problem's formulation in 1921, the first polynomial-time\nalgorithm to compute Nash equilibrium (NE) strategies for this game was\ndiscovered only quite recently. In 2016,\n\\cite{ahmadinejad_dehghani_hajiaghayi_lucier_mahini_seddighin_2019} formulated\na breakthrough algorithm to compute NE strategies for the Colonel Blotto game\nin computational complexity $O(k^{14}\\max\\{a,b\\}^{13})$, receiving substantial\nmedia coverage (e.g. \\cite{Insider}, \\cite{NSF}, \\cite{ScienceDaily}). As of\nthis work, this is the only known algorithm (to our knowledge) for the Colonel\nBlotto game with general parameters.\nIn this work, we present the first known algorithm to compute\n$\\eps$-approximate NE strategies in the two-player Colonel Blotto game in\nruntime $\\widetilde{O}(\\eps^{-4} k^8 \\max\\{a,b\\})$ for arbitrary settings of\nthese parameters.

Prior to this work, no polynomial-time algorithm was known\nto compute exact or approximate equilibrium (in any sense) strategies for\nmultiplayer Colonel Blotto with arbitrary parameters.

Neuromorphic hardware implementing\nSpiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are particularly attractive in this regard, as\ntheir real-time, event-based, local computing paradigm makes them suitable for\nedge implementations and fast learning. However, the long and iterative\nlearning that characterizes state-of-the-art SNN training is incompatible with\nthe physical nature and real-time operation of neuromorphic hardware.

Because surrogate\ngradients can be made twice differentiable, well-established, and effective\nsecond-order gradient meta-learning methods such as Model Agnostic Meta\nLearning (MAML) can be used.

    "abstract": "Given the ubiquity of deep neural networks, it is important that these models\ndo not reveal information about sensitive data that they have been trained on.\nIn model inversion attacks, a malicious user attempts to recover the private\ndataset used to train a supervised neural network. A successful model inversion\nattack should generate realistic and diverse samples that accurately describe\neach of the classes in the private dataset. In this work, we provide a\nprobabilistic interpretation of model inversion attacks, and formulate a\nvariational objective that accounts for both diversity and accuracy. In order\nto optimize this variational objective, we choose a variational family defined\nin the code space of a deep generative model, trained on a public auxiliary\ndataset that shares some structural similarity with the target dataset.\nEmpirically, our method substantially improves performance in terms of target\nattack accuracy, sample realism, and diversity on datasets of faces and chest\nX-ray images.",

    "abstract": "In the Vision-and-Language Navigation task, the embodied agent follows\nlinguistic instructions and navigates to a specific goal. It is important in\nmany practical scenarios and has attracted extensive attention from both\ncomputer vision and robotics communities.

To this end,\nwe develop a novel self-supervised training framework to encode the voxel-level\n3D semantic reconstruction into a 3D semantic representation. Specifically, a\nregion query task is designed as the pretext task, which predicts the presence\nor absence of objects of a particular class in a specific 3D region. Then, we\nconstruct an LSTM-based navigation model and train it with the proposed 3D\nsemantic representations and BERT language features on vision-language pairs.\nExperiments show that the proposed approach achieves success rates of 68% and\n66% on the validation unseen and test unseen splits of the R2R dataset\nrespectively, which are superior to most of RGB-based methods utilizing\nvision-language transformers.",

It's even harder to find different excellent\nmodels for multiple datasets. Recent works show that the best model structure\nis related to the dataset used, and one single model cannot adapt to all tasks.\nIn this paper, we propose an automated Question-Answering framework, which\ncould automatically adjust network architecture for multiple datasets.

The performance estimator could\nquickly filter out models with bad performance in population as the number of\ntrials increases, to speed up the convergence.

    "abstract": "Attention mechanism has been widely believed as the key to success of vision\ntransformers (ViTs), since it provides a flexible and powerful way to model\nspatial relationships. However, is the attention mechanism truly an\nindispensable part of ViT? Can it be replaced by some other alternatives? To\ndemystify the role of attention mechanism, we simplify it into an extremely\nsimple case: ZERO FLOP and ZERO parameter. Concretely, we revisit the shift\noperation. It does not contain any parameter or arithmetic calculation. The\nonly operation is to exchange a small portion of the channels between\nneighboring features. Based on this simple operation, we construct a new\nbackbone network, namely ShiftViT, where the attention layers in ViT are\nsubstituted by shift operations. Surprisingly, ShiftViT works quite well in\nseveral mainstream tasks, e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation.\nThe performance is on par with or even better than the strong baseline Swin\nTransformer. These results suggest that the attention mechanism might not be\nthe vital factor that makes ViT successful. It can be even replaced by a\nzero-parameter operation.

    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can model many real world\napplications. However, many MARL approaches rely on epsilon greedy for\nexploration, which may discourage visiting advantageous states in hard\nscenarios. In this paper, we propose a new approach QMIX(SEG) for tackling\nMARL. It makes use of the value function factorization method QMIX to train\nper-agent policies and a novel Semantic Epsilon Greedy (SEG) exploration\nstrategy. SEG is a simple extension to the conventional epsilon greedy\nexploration strategy, yet it is experimentally shown to greatly improve the\nperformance of MARL. We first cluster actions into groups of actions with\nsimilar effects and then use the groups in a bi-level epsilon greedy\nexploration hierarchy for action selection. We argue that SEG facilitates\nsemantic exploration by exploring in the space of groups of actions, which have\nricher semantic meanings than atomic actions.

Such startups aim at developing new business models\nwhile at the same time relying on the resources from the companies where they\nemerged.

This paper seeks to address\nthis problem by asking the research question: how to make internal software\nstartups work? We examined a unique case of a venture builder, a company\nprimarily focusing on building internal software startups and launching them as\nindependent companies. Applying a Grounded Theory approach, we analyzed data on\nfour internal software startups at the case company. The results suggest that\nfour strategies drive the examined startups, cultural, financial, personnel,\nand venture arrangement. We interpret our results by drawing on earlier\nliterature on intrapreneurship and internal ventures and suggest four\nrecommendations to succeed with internal software startups 1 establish shared\narenas for the employees, 2 provide necessary resources for experimentation in\nthe initial phase and increase them incrementally, 3 build up in-house product\nmanagement competence through coaching, and 4 harness employees own motivation\nto develop their own ideas.",

Often, the features added by\ndifferent systems were motivated by the interdisciplinary needs of programmers\nand implementors, yielding systems that, while sharing the \"classic\" core\nlanguage, and, in particular, the main aspects of the ISO-Prolog standard, also\ndepart from each other in other aspects. This obviously poses challenges for\ncode portability. The field has also inspired many related, but quite different\nlanguages that have created their own communities.\nThis article aims at integrating and applying the main lessons learned in the\nprocess of evolution of Prolog. It is structured into three major parts.\nFirstly, we overview the evolution of Prolog systems and the community\napproximately up to the ISO standard, considering both the main historic\ndevelopments and the motivations behind several Prolog implementations, as well\nas other logic programming languages influenced by Prolog. Then, we discuss the\nProlog implementations that are most active after the appearance of the\nstandard: their visions, goals, commonalities, and incompatibilities. Finally,\nwe perform a SWOT analysis in order to better identify the potential of Prolog,\nand propose future directions along which Prolog might continue to add useful\nfeatures, interfaces, libraries, and tools, while at the same time improving\ncompatibility between implementations.",

    "abstract": "Ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) is a technique for the numerical solution of\ninverse problems. A great advantage of the EKI's ensemble approach is that\nderivatives are not required in its implementation. But theoretically speaking,\nEKI's ensemble size needs to surpass the dimension of the problem. This is\nbecause of EKI's \"subspace property\", i.e., that the EKI solution is a linear\ncombination of the initial ensemble it starts off with. We show that the\nensemble can break out of this initial subspace when ``localization'' is\napplied. In essence, localization enforces an assumed correlation structure\nonto the problem, and is heavily used in ensemble Kalman filtering and data\nassimilation. We describe and analyze how to apply localization to the EKI, and\nhow localization helps the EKI ensemble break out of the initial subspace.\nSpecifically, we show that the localized EKI (LEKI) ensemble will collapse to a\nsingle point (as intended) and that the LEKI ensemble mean will converge to the\nglobal optimum at a sublinear rate. Under strict assumptions on the\nlocalization procedure and observation process, we further show that the data\nmisfit decays uniformly. We illustrate our ideas and theoretical developments\nwith numerical examples with simplified toy problems, a Lorenz model, and an\ninversion of electromagnetic data, where some of our mathematical assumptions\nmay only be approximately valid.",

    "abstract": "One of the core envisions of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks is\nto accumulate artificial intelligence (AI) for autonomous controlling of the\nInternet of Everything (IoE). Particularly, the quality of IoE services\ndelivery must be maintained by analyzing contextual metrics of IoE such as\npeople, data, process, and things. However, the challenges incorporate when the\nAI model conceives a lake of interpretation and intuition to the network\nservice provider. Therefore, this paper provides an explainable artificial\nintelligence (XAI) framework for quality-aware IoE service delivery that\nenables both intelligence and interpretation. First, a problem of quality-aware\nIoE service delivery is formulated by taking into account network dynamics and\ncontextual metrics of IoE, where the objective is to maximize the channel\nquality index (CQI) of each IoE service user. Second, a regression problem is\ndevised to solve the formulated problem, where explainable coefficients of the\ncontextual matrices are estimated by Shapley value interpretation. Third, the\nXAI-enabled quality-aware IoE service delivery algorithm is implemented by\nemploying ensemble-based regression models for ensuring the interpretation of\ncontextual relationships among the matrices to reconfigure network parameters.\nFinally, the experiment results show that the uplink improvement rate becomes\n42.43% and 16.32% for the AdaBoost and Extra Trees, respectively, while the\ndownlink improvement rate reaches up to 28.57% and 14.29%. However, the\nAdaBoost-based approach cannot maintain the CQI of IoE service users.\nTherefore, the proposed Extra Trees-based regression model shows significant\nperformance gain for mitigating the trade-off between accuracy and\ninterpretability than other baselines.",

    "abstract": "3D object detection is a fundamental and challenging task for 3D scene\nunderstanding, and the monocular-based methods can serve as an economical\nalternative to the stereo-based or LiDAR-based methods. However, accurately\ndetecting objects in the 3D space from a single image is extremely difficult\ndue to the lack of spatial cues. To mitigate this issue, we propose a simple\nand effective scheme to introduce the spatial information from LiDAR signals to\nthe monocular 3D detectors, without introducing any extra cost in the inference\nphase. In particular, we first project the LiDAR signals into the image plane\nand align them with the RGB images. After that, we use the resulting data to\ntrain a 3D detector (LiDAR Net) with the same architecture as the baseline\nmodel. Finally, this LiDAR Net can serve as the teacher to transfer the learned\nknowledge to the baseline model. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod can significantly boost the performance of the baseline model and ranks\nthe $1^{st}$ place among all monocular-based methods on the KITTI benchmark.\nBesides, extensive ablation studies are conducted, which further prove the\neffectiveness of each part of our designs and illustrate what the baseline\nmodel has learned from the LiDAR Net.

    "abstract": "`Tracking' is the collection of data about an individual's activity across\nmultiple distinct contexts and the retention, use, or sharing of data derived\nfrom that activity outside the context in which it occurred. This paper aims to\nintroduce tracking on the web, smartphones, and the Internet of Things, to an\naudience with little or no previous knowledge. It covers these topics primarily\nfrom the perspective of computer science and human-computer interaction, but\nalso includes relevant law and policy aspects. Rather than a systematic\nliterature review, it aims to provide an over-arching narrative spanning this\nlarge research space.\nSection 1 introduces the concept of tracking. Section 2 provides a short\nhistory of the major developments of tracking on the web. Section 3 presents\nresearch covering the detection, measurement and analysis of web tracking\ntechnologies. Section 4 delves into the countermeasures against web tracking\nand mechanisms that have been proposed to allow users to control and limit\ntracking, as well as studies into end-user perspectives on tracking. Section 5\nfocuses on tracking on `smart' devices including smartphones and the internet\nof things. Section 6 covers emerging issues affecting the future of tracking\nacross these different platforms.",

    "abstract": "Objective. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) or Broken Object Level\nAuthorization (BOLA) are one of the critical type of access control\nvulnerabilities for modern applications. As a result, an attacker can bypass\nauthorization checks leading to information leakage, account takeover. Our main\nresearch goal was to help an application security architect to optimize\nsecurity design and testing process by giving an algorithm and tool that allows\nto automatically analyze system API specifications and generate list of\npossible vulnerabilities and attack vector ready to be used as security\nnon-functional requirements. Method. We conducted a multivocal review of\nresearch and conference papers, bug bounty program reports and other grey\nsources of literature to outline patterns of attacks against IDOR\nvulnerability. These attacks are collected in groups proceeding with further\nanalysis common attributes between these groups and what features compose the\ngroup. Endpoint properties and attack techniques comprise a group of attacks.\nMapping between group features and existing OpenAPI specifications is performed\nto implement a tool for automatic discovery of potentially vulnerable\nendpoints. Results and practical relevance. In this work, we provide\nsystematization of IDOR/BOLA attack techniques based on literature review, real\ncases analysis and derive IDOR/BOLA attack groups. We proposed an approach to\ndescribe IDOR/BOLA attacks based on OpenAPI specifications properties. We\ndevelop an algorithm of potential IDOR/BOLA vulnerabilities detection based on\nOpenAPI specification processing. We implemented our novel algorithm using\nPython and evaluated it. The results show that algorithm is resilient and can\nbe used in practice to detect potential IDOR/BOLA vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "Acquiring accurate labels on large-scale datasets is both time consuming and\nexpensive. To reduce the dependency of deep learning models on learning from\nclean labeled data, several recent research efforts are focused on learning\nwith noisy labels. These methods typically fall into three design categories to\nlearn a noise robust model: sample selection approaches, noise robust loss\nfunctions, or label correction methods. In this paper, we propose PARS:\nPseudo-Label Aware Robust Sample Selection, a hybrid approach that combines the\nbest from all three worlds in a joint-training framework to achieve robustness\nto noisy labels. Specifically, PARS exploits all training samples using both\nthe raw/noisy labels and estimated/refurbished pseudo-labels via self-training,\ndivides samples into an ambiguous and a noisy subset via loss analysis, and\ndesigns label-dependent noise-aware loss functions for both sets of filtered\nlabels. Results show that PARS significantly outperforms the state of the art\non extensive studies on the noisy CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, particularly\non challenging high-noise and low-resource settings. In particular, PARS\nachieved an absolute 12% improvement in test accuracy on the CIFAR-100 dataset\nwith 90% symmetric label noise, and an absolute 27% improvement in test\naccuracy when only 1/5 of the noisy labels are available during training as an\nadditional restriction.

In this paper, we propose a faster\ngradient variant called Quadratic Gradient for logistic regression and\nimplement it via a special homomorphic encryption scheme. The core of this\ngradient variant can be seen as an extension of the simplified fixed Hessian\nfrom Newton's method, which extracts information from the Hessian matrix into\nthe naive gradient, and thus can be used to enhance Nesterov's accelerated\ngradient (NAG), Adagrad, etc. We evaluate various gradient $ascent$ methods\nwith this gradient variant on the gene dataset provided by the 2017 iDASH\ncompetition and the image dataset from the MNIST database. Experimental results\nshow that the enhanced methods converge faster and sometimes even to a better\nconvergence result.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of sharing sensitive or valuable files across users\nwhile partially relying on a common, untrusted third-party, e.g., a Cloud\nStorage Provider (CSP). Although users can rely on a secure peer-to-peer (P2P)\nchannel for file sharing, this introduces potential delay on the data transfer\nand requires the sender to remain active and connected while the transfer\nprocess occurs. Instead of using the P2P channel for the entire file, users can\nupload information about the file on a common CSP and share only the essential\ninformation that enables the receiver to download and recover the original\nfile. This paper introduces Bifrost, an innovative file sharing system inspired\nby recent results on dual deduplication. Bifrost achieves the desired\nfunctionality and simultaneously guarantees that (1) the CSP can efficiently\ncompress outsourced data; (2) the secure P2P channel is used only to transmit\nshort, but crucial information; (3) users can check for data integrity, i.e.,\ndetect if the CSP alters the outsourced data; and (4) only the sender (data\nowner) and the intended receiver can access the file after sharing, i.e., the\ncloud or no malicious adversary can infer useful information about the shared\nfile. We analyze compression and bandwidth performance using a proof-of-concept\nimplementation. Our experiments show that secure file sharing can be achieved\nby sending only 650 bits on the P2P channel, irrespective of file size, while\nthe CSP that aids the sharing can enjoy a compression rate of 86.9 %.",

It is desirable to view such manually measured points together\nwith the endoscopic image for further assistance. Therefore, hand-eye\ncalibration is required that links both coordinate systems and is a\nprerequisite to project the points onto the image plane. A complementary\napproach to this is to use a vision-based endoscopic stereo-setup to detect and\ntriangulate points of interest, to obtain the 3D coordinates. In this paper, we\naim to compare both approaches on a rigid phantom and two patient-individual\nsilicone replica which resemble the intraoperative scenario.

    "title": "Feminist Perspective on Robot Learning Processes",
    "abstract": "As different research works report and daily life experiences confirm,\nlearning models can result in biased outcomes. The biased learned models\nusually replicate historical discrimination in society and typically negatively\naffect the less represented identities. Robots are equipped with these models\nthat allow them to operate, performing tasks more complex every day. The\nlearning process consists of different stages depending on human judgments.\nMoreover, the resulting learned models for robot decisions rely on recorded\nlabeled data or demonstrations. Therefore, the robot learning process is\nsusceptible to bias linked to human behavior in society. This imposes a\npotential danger, especially when robots operate around humans and the learning\nprocess can reflect the social unfairness present today. Different feminist\nproposals study social inequality and provide essential perspectives towards\nremoving bias in various fields. What is more, feminism allowed and still\nallows to reconfigure numerous social dynamics and stereotypes advocating for\nequality across people through their diversity. Consequently, we provide a\nfeminist perspective on the robot learning process in this work. We base our\ndiscussion on intersectional feminism, community feminism, decolonial feminism,\nand pedagogy perspectives, and we frame our work in a feminist robotics\napproach. In this paper, we present an initial discussion to emphasize the\nrelevance of feminist perspectives to explore, foresee, en eventually correct\nthe biased robot decisions.",

Our work provides new insights into the posterior distribution in\nterms of human-understandable feature information with regard to the underlying\ndecision-making strategies. Our main findings are the following: 1) global XAI\nmethods can be applied to explain the diversity of decision-making strategies\nof BNN instances, 2) Monte Carlo dropout exhibits increased diversity in\nfeature representations compared to the multimodal posterior approximation of\nMultiSWAG, 3) the diversity of learned feature representations highly\ncorrelates with the uncertainty estimates, and 4) the inter-mode diversity of\nthe multimodal posterior decreases as the network width increases, while the\nintra-mode diversity increases.

    "abstract": "Physical field reconstruction is highly desirable for the measurement and\ncontrol of engineering systems. The reconstruction of the temperature field\nfrom limited observation plays a crucial role in thermal management for\nelectronic equipment. Deep learning has been employed in physical field\nreconstruction, whereas the accurate estimation for the regions with large\ngradients is still diffcult. To solve the problem, this work proposes a novel\ndeep learning method based on patchwise training to reconstruct the temperature\nfield of electronic equipment accurately from limited observation. Firstly, the\ntemperature field reconstruction (TFR) problem of the electronic equipment is\nmodeled mathematically and transformed as an image-to-image regression task.\nThen a patchwise training and inference framework consisting of an adaptive\nUNet and a shallow multilayer perceptron (MLP) is developed to establish the\nmapping from the observation to the temperature field. The adaptive UNet is\nutilized to reconstruct the whole temperature field while the MLP is designed\nto predict the patches with large temperature gradients. Experiments employing\nfinite element simulation data are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the\nproposed method. Furthermore, the generalization is evaluated by investigating\ncases under different heat source layouts, different power intensities, and\ndifferent observation point locations. The maximum absolute errors of the\nreconstructed temperature field are less than 1K under the patchwise training\napproach.",

    "abstract": "Non-contact facial video-based heart rate estimation using remote\nphotoplethysmography (rPPG) has shown great potential in many applications\n(e.g., remote health care) and achieved creditable results in constrained\nscenarios. However, practical applications require results to be accurate even\nunder complex environment with head movement and unstable illumination.\nTherefore, improving the performance of rPPG in complex environment has become\na key challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel video embedding method that\nembeds each facial video sequence into a feature map referred to as Multi-scale\nAdaptive Spatial and Temporal Map with Overlap (MAST_Mop), which contains not\nonly vital information but also surrounding information as reference, which\nacts as the mirror to figure out the homogeneous perturbations imposed on\nforeground and background simultaneously, such as illumination instability.\nCorrespondingly, we propose a two-stream Transformer model to map the MAST_Mop\ninto heart rate (HR), where one stream follows the pulse signal in the facial\narea while the other figures out the perturbation signal from the surrounding\nregion such that the difference of the two channels leads to adaptive noise\ncancellation. Our approach significantly outperforms all current\nstate-of-the-art methods on two public datasets MAHNOB-HCI and VIPL-HR. As far\nas we know, it is the first work with Transformer as backbone to capture the\ntemporal dependencies in rPPGs and apply the two stream scheme to figure out\nthe interference from backgrounds as mirror of the corresponding perturbation\non foreground signals for noise tolerating.",

    "abstract": "Expressing class specifications via executable constraints is important for\nvarious software engineering tasks such as test generation, bug finding and\nautomated debugging, but developers rarely write them. Techniques that infer\nspecifications from code exist to fill this gap, but they are designed to\nsupport specific kinds of assertions and are difficult to adapt to support\ndifferent assertion languages, e.g., to add support for quantification, or\nadditional comparison operators, such as membership or containment.\nTo address the above issue, we present SpecFuzzer, a novel technique that\ncombines grammar-based fuzzing, dynamic invariant detection, and mutation\nanalysis, to automatically produce class specifications. SpecFuzzer uses: (i) a\nfuzzer as a generator of candidate assertions derived from a grammar that is\nautomatically obtained from the class definition; (ii) a dynamic invariant\ndetector -- Daikon -- to filter out assertions invalidated by a test suite; and\n(iii) a mutation-based mechanism to cluster and rank assertions, so that\nsimilar constraints are grouped and then the stronger prioritized.\nGrammar-based fuzzing enables SpecFuzzer to be straightforwardly adapted to\nsupport different specification languages, by manipulating the fuzzing grammar,\ne.g., to include additional operators.\nWe evaluate our technique on a benchmark of 43 Java methods employed in the\nevaluation of the state-of-the-art techniques GAssert and EvoSpex.

Thus, the proposed S$^2$NN has a\nlower computational cost than SNNs that require time-series processing.\nHowever, S$^2$NN cannot adopt na\\\"{i}ve backpropagation algorithms due to the\nnon-differentiability nature of spikes. We deduce a suitable neuron model by\nreducing the surrogate gradient for multi-time step SNNs to a single-time step.\nWe experimentally demonstrated that the obtained neuron model enables S$^2$NN\nto train more accurately and energy-efficiently than existing neuron models for\nSNNs and BNNs. We also showed that the proposed S$^2$NN could achieve\ncomparable accuracy to full-precision networks while being highly\nenergy-efficient.",

The RBO Hand 3 is designed to enable\ndexterous manipulation, to facilitate transfer of insights about human\ndexterity, and to serve as a robust research platform for extensive real-world\nexperiments. It achieves these design goals by combining many degrees of\nactuation with intrinsic compliance, replicating relevant functioning of the\nhuman hand, and by combining robust components in a modular design. The RBO\nHand 3 possesses 16 independent degrees of actuation, implemented in a\ndexterous opposable thumb, two-chambered fingers, an actuated palm, and the\nability to spread the fingers. In this work, we derive the design objectives\nthat are based on experimentation with the hand's predecessors, observations\nabout human grasping, and insights about principles of dexterity. We explain in\ndetail how the design features of the RBO Hand 3 achieve these goals and\nevaluate the hand by demonstrating its ability to achieve the highest possible\nscore in the Kapandji test for thumb opposition, to realize all 33 grasp types\nof the comprehensive GRASP taxonomy, to replicate common human grasping\nstrategies, and to perform dexterous in-hand manipulation.",

The\nperformance of ray casting depends strongly on the used interpolant and its\nefficient evaluation. Unfortunately, analytical solutions for ray-surface\nintersections are only given in the literature for very few simple, piece-wise\npolynomial surfaces. In our use case, we approximate the heightfield with\nradial basis functions defined on an adaptive grid, for which we propose a\ntwo-step solution: First, we reconstruct and discretize the currently visible\nportion of the surface with smooth approximation into a set of off-screen\nbuffers. In a second step, we interpret these off-screen buffers as regular\nheightfields that can be rendered efficiently with ray casting using a simple\nbilinear interpolant. While our approach works, our quantitative evaluation\nshows that the performance depends strongly on the complexity and size of the\nheightfield. Real-time performance cannot be achieved for arbitrary\nheightfields, which is why we report our findings as a failed attempt to use\nray casting for practical geospatial visualization in real time.",

This approach raises several challenges\ndue to the different statistical distribution of the local datasets and the\nclients' computational heterogeneity.

BTs communicate with a data distribution\nservice (DDS) to send and receive data. Since the standard BT derived from one\nroot node with a single tick is unsuitable for multiple robots, a novel type of\nBT action and improved nodes are proposed to control multiple robots through a\nDDS asynchronously. To plan tasks for robots efficiently, a single task\nplanning unit is implemented with the proposed task types. The task planning\nunit assigns tasks to each robot simultaneously through a single coalesced BT.\nIf any robot falls into a fault while performing its assigned task, another BT\nembedded in the robot is executed; the robot enters the recovery mode in order\nto overcome the fault. To perform this function, the action in the BT\ncorresponding to the task is defined as a variable, which is shared with the\nDDS so that any action can be exchanged between the task planning unit and\nrobots. To show the feasibility of our framework in a real-world application,\nthree mobile robots were experimentally coordinated for them to travel\nalternately to four goal positions by the proposed single task planning unit\nvia a DDS.",

Such geometry is intricate and realistic, however the\ngeneration of photo-realistic textures for such large scenes remains a problem.\nWe propose to generate textures for input target 3D meshes driven by the\ntextural style present in readily available datasets of panoramic photos\ncapturing urban environments. Re-targeting such 2D datasets to 3D geometry is\nchallenging because the underlying shape, size, and layout of the urban\nstructures in the photos do not correspond to the ones in the target meshes.\nPhotos also often have objects (e.g., trees, vehicles) that may not even be\npresent in the target geometry.To address these issues we present a method,\ncalled Projective Urban Texturing (PUT), which re-targets textural style from\nreal-world panoramic images to unseen urban meshes. PUT relies on contrastive\nand adversarial training of a neural architecture designed for unpaired\nimage-to-texture translation. The generated textures are stored in a texture\natlas applied to the target 3D mesh geometry.

Our\nstudy is motivated by the fact that, since most of existing NA methods have\nattempted to discover all node pairs at once, they do not harness information\nenriched through interim discovery of node correspondences to more accurately\nfind the next correspondences during the node matching. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose Grad-Align, a new NA method that gradually discovers node\npairs by making full use of node pairs exhibiting strong consistency, which are\neasy to be discovered in the early stage of gradual matching. Specifically,\nGrad-Align first generates node embeddings of the two networks based on graph\nneural networks along with our layer-wise reconstruction loss, a loss built\nupon capturing the first-order and higher-order neighborhood structures. Then,\nnodes are gradually aligned by computing dual-perception similarity measures\nincluding the multi-layer embedding similarity as well as the Tversky\nsimilarity, an asymmetric set similarity using the Tversky index applicable to\nnetworks with different scales. Additionally, we incorporate an edge\naugmentation module into Grad-Align to reinforce the structural consistency.\nThrough comprehensive experiments using real-world and synthetic datasets, we\nempirically demonstrate that Grad-Align consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art NA methods.",

To address\nthis need, this paper presents a new solution for deploying and training\nstate-of-the-art models on the resource-constrained devices. First, the paper\nproposes a novel filter-pruning-based model compression method to create\nlightweight trainable models from large models trained in the cloud, without\nmuch loss of accuracy.

The results show that 1) our model compression method can\nremove up to 99.36% parameters of WRN-28-10, while preserving a Top-1 accuracy\nof over 90% on CIFAR-10; 2) our knowledge transfer method enables the\ncompressed models to achieve more than 90% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and retain good\naccuracy on old categories; 3) it allows the compressed models to converge\nwithin real time (three to six minutes) on the edge for incremental learning\ntasks; 4) it enables the model to classify unseen categories of data (78.92%\nTop-1 accuracy) that it is never trained with.",

Considering the frontier\nadvances of Transformer architecture in the computer vision field, in this\npaper, we present the first attempt at designing a Transformer-based damage\nassessment architecture (DamFormer). In DamFormer, a siamese Transformer\nencoder is first constructed to extract non-local and representative deep\nfeatures from input multitemporal image-pairs.

In this paper, we\npresent a novel analysis on the robustness of discriminative ZSL to image\ncorruptions.

Accurately categorizing these activities\nrequires not only recognizing the individual steps that compose the task but\nalso capturing their temporal dependencies. This problem is dramatically\ndifferent from traditional action classification, where models are typically\noptimized on videos that span only a few seconds and that are manually trimmed\nto contain simple atomic actions. While step annotations could enable the\ntraining of models to recognize the individual steps of procedural activities,\nexisting large-scale datasets in this area do not include such segment labels\ndue to the prohibitive cost of manually annotating temporal boundaries in long\nvideos. To address this issue, we propose to automatically identify steps in\ninstructional videos by leveraging the distant supervision of a textual\nknowledge base (wikiHow) that includes detailed descriptions of the steps\nneeded for the execution of a wide variety of complex activities. Our method\nuses a language model to match noisy, automatically-transcribed speech from the\nvideo to step descriptions in the knowledge base.

Furthermore, we derive the MGFs of the AoI and peak AoI for the\nsource-agnostic preemptive and non-preemptive policy, for which only the\naverage AoI and peak AoI have been derived earlier. Finally, we use the MGFs to\nderive the average AoI and peak AoI in a two-source M/G/1/1 queueing model\nunder each policy. Numerical results show the effect of the service time\ndistribution parameters on the average AoI: for a given service rate, when the\ntail of the service time distribution is sufficiently heavy, the\nsource-agnostic preemptive policy is the best policy, whereas for a\nsufficiently light tailed distribution, the non-preemptive policy is the best\npolicy. The results also highlight the importance of higher moments of the AoI.",

    "abstract": "We study the dynamics of simple congestion games with two resources where a\ncontinuum of agents behaves according to a version of Experience-Weighted\nAttraction (EWA) algorithm. The dynamics is characterized by two parameters:\nthe (population) intensity of choice $a>0$ capturing the economic rationality\nof the total population of agents and a discount factor $\\sigma\\in [0,1]$\ncapturing a type of memory loss where past outcomes matter exponentially less\nthan the recent ones. Finally, our system adds a third parameter $b \\in (0,1)$,\nwhich captures the asymmetry of the cost functions of the two resources. It is\nthe proportion of the agents using the first resource at Nash equilibrium, with\n$b=1/2$ capturing a symmetric network.\nWithin this simple framework, we show a plethora of bifurcation phenomena\nwhere behavioral dynamics destabilize from global convergence to equilibrium,\nto limit cycles or even (formally proven) chaos as a function of the parameters\n$a$, $b$ and $\\sigma$. Specifically, we show that for any discount factor\n$\\sigma$ the system will be destabilized for a sufficiently large intensity of\nchoice $a$. Although for discount factor $\\sigma=0$ almost always (i.e., $b\n\\neq 1/2$) the system will become chaotic, as $\\sigma$ increases the chaotic\nregime will give place to the attracting periodic orbit of period 2. Therefore,\nmemory loss can simplify game dynamics and make the system predictable. We\ncomplement our theoretical analysis with simulations and several bifurcation\ndiagrams that showcase the unyielding complexity of the population dynamics\n(e.g., attracting periodic orbits of different lengths) even in the simplest\npossible potential games.",

We consider two restrictions of this model, which we\ncall weakly and strongly read-once, both generalizing standard read-once\nbranching programs and parity decision trees. Our main results are as follows.\n- Average-case complexity. We define a pseudo-random class of functions which\nwe call directional affine extractors, and show that these functions are hard\non average for the strongly read-once model. We then present an explicit\nconstruction of such function with good parameters. This strengthens the result\nof Cohen and Shinkar (ITCS'16) who gave such average-case hardness for parity\ndecision trees. Directional affine extractors are stronger than the more\nfamiliar class of affine extractors. Given the significance of these functions,\nwe expect that our new class of functions might be of independent interest.\n- Proof complexity. We also consider the proof system $\\text{Res}[\\oplus]$\nwhich is an extension of resolution with linear queries. A refutation of a CNF\nin this proof system naturally defines a linear branching program solving the\ncorresponding search problem.

    "abstract": "Humans show language-biased image recognition for a word-embedded image,\nknown as picture-word interference. Such interference depends on hierarchical\nsemantic categories and reflects that human language processing highly\ninteracts with visual processing. Similar to humans, recent artificial models\njointly trained on texts and images, e.g., OpenAI CLIP, show language-biased\nimage classification. Exploring whether the bias leads to interferences similar\nto those observed in humans can contribute to understanding how much the model\nacquires hierarchical semantic representations from joint learning of language\nand vision. The present study introduces methodological tools from the\ncognitive science literature to assess the biases of artificial models.\nSpecifically, we introduce a benchmark task to test whether words superimposed\non images can distort the image classification across different category levels\nand, if it can, whether the perturbation is due to the shared semantic\nrepresentation between language and vision. Our dataset is a set of\nword-embedded images and consists of a mixture of natural image datasets and\nhierarchical word labels with superordinate/basic category levels. Using this\nbenchmark test, we evaluate the CLIP model. We show that presenting words\ndistorts the image classification by the model across different category\nlevels, but the effect does not depend on the semantic relationship between\nimages and embedded words. This suggests that the semantic word representation\nin the CLIP visual processing is not shared with the image representation,\nalthough the word representation strongly dominates for word-embedded images.",

    "abstract": "To face pandemics like the one caused by COVID-19, resources such as personal\nprotection equipment (PPE) are needed to reduce the infection rate and protect\nthose in close contact with patients (Heymann and Shindo, 2020; Klompas et al.,\n2021). The demand for those products increases exponentially as the number of\ninfected grows, outpacing any growth that local production facilities can\nachieve (Ranney et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020). Disruptions in the global\nsupply chain by closing factories or scaled-down transport routes can further\nincrease resource scarcity (McMahon et al., 2020). During the first phase of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed a reflex of `our people first' in many\nregions, countries, and continents (Baldwin and Evenett, 2020). In this paper,\nhowever, we show that a cooperative sharing mechanism can substantially improve\nthe ability to face epidemics. We present a stylized model in which communities\nshare their resources such that each can receive resources whenever a local\nepidemic flares up. This can potentially prevent local resource exhaustion and\nreduce the total number of infected cases. We also show that the success of\nsharing resources heavily depends on having a sufficiently long delay between\nthe onset of epidemics in different communities. This means that a global\nsharing mechanism should be paired with measures to slow down the spread of\ninfections from one community to the other. Our work is a first step towards\ndesigning a resilient global supply chain mechanism that can deal with future\npandemics by design, rather than being subjected to the coincidental and\nunequal distribution of opportunities per community at present.",

Our results are the first to show that the widely popular heuristic\nof scaling the client updates with an extra parameter is very useful in the\ncontext of Federated Averaging (FedAvg) with local passes over the client data.\nEach local pass is performed without replacement using Random Reshuffling,\nwhich is a key reason we can show improved complexities. In particular, we\nprove that whenever the local stepsizes are small, and the update direction is\ngiven by FedAvg in conjunction with Random Reshuffling over all clients, one\ncan take a big leap in the obtained direction and improve rates for convex,\nstrongly convex, and non-convex objectives. In particular, in non-convex regime\nwe get an enhancement of the rate of convergence from\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\varepsilon^{-3}\\right)$ to\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\varepsilon^{-2}\\right)$. This result is new even for Random\nReshuffling performed on a single node. In contrast, if the local stepsizes are\nlarge, we prove that the noise of client sampling can be controlled by using a\nsmall server-side stepsize. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ntime that local steps provably help to overcome the communication bottleneck.\nTogether, our results on the advantage of large and small server-side stepsizes\ngive a formal justification for the practice of adaptive server-side\noptimization in federated learning.

There are multiple tiers of computing (IoT devices, near\nedge, far edge, cloud, etc.) that are connected with different types of\nnetworking technologies (LAN, LTE, 5G, MAN, WAN, etc.). Deployment and\nmanagement of applications in such an environment is quite challenging. In this\npaper, we propose ROMA, which performs resource orchestration for\nmicroservices-based 5G applications in a dynamic, heterogeneous, multi-tiered\ncompute and network fabric. We assume that only application-level requirements\nare known, and the detailed requirements of the individual microservices in the\napplication are not specified. As part of our solution, ROMA identifies and\nleverages the coupling relationship between compute and network usage for\nvarious microservices and solves an optimization problem in order to\nappropriately identify how each microservice should be deployed in the complex,\nmulti-tiered compute and network fabric, so that the end-to-end application\nrequirements are optimally met. We implemented two real-world 5G applications\nin video surveillance and intelligent transportation system (ITS) domains.\nThrough extensive experiments, we show that ROMA is able to save up to 90%, 55%\nand 44% compute and up to 80%, 95% and 75% network bandwidth for the\nsurveillance (watchlist) and transportation application (person and car\ndetection), respectively.

    "abstract": "Capturing high-frequency data concerning the condition of complex systems,\ne.g. by acoustic monitoring, has become increasingly prevalent. Such\nhigh-frequency signals typically contain time dependencies ranging over\ndifferent time scales and different types of cyclic behaviors. Processing such\nsignals requires careful feature engineering, particularly the extraction of\nmeaningful time-frequency features. This can be time-consuming and the\nperformance is often dependent on the choice of parameters. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a deep learning framework for learnable wavelet packet\ntransforms, enabling to learn features automatically from data and optimise\nthem with respect to the defined objective function. The learned features can\nbe represented as a spectrogram, containing the important time-frequency\ninformation of the dataset. We evaluate the properties and performance of the\nproposed approach by evaluating its improved spectral leakage and by applying\nit to an anomaly detection task for acoustic monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Neural retrieval models are generally regarded as fundamentally different\nfrom the retrieval techniques used in the late 1990's when the TREC ad hoc test\ncollections were constructed. They thus provide the opportunity to empirically\ntest the claim that pooling-built test collections can reliably evaluate\nretrieval systems that did not contribute to the construction of the collection\n(in other words, that such collections can be reusable). To test the\nreusability claim, we asked TREC assessors to judge new pools created from new\nsearch results for the TREC-8 ad hoc collection. These new search results\nconsisted of five new runs (one each from three transformer-based models and\ntwo baseline runs that use BM25) plus the set of TREC-8 submissions that did\nnot previously contribute to pools. The new runs did retrieve previously unseen\ndocuments, but the vast majority of those documents were not relevant. The\nranking of all runs by mean evaluation score when evaluated using the official\nTREC-8 relevance judgment set and the newly expanded relevance set are almost\nidentical, with Kendall's tau correlations greater than 0.99. Correlations for\nindividual topics are also high. The TREC-8 ad hoc collection was originally\nconstructed using deep pools over a diverse set of runs, including several\neffective manual runs. Its judgment budget, and hence construction cost, was\nrelatively large. However, it does appear that the expense was well-spent: even\nwith the advent of neural techniques, the collection has stood the test of time\nand remains a reliable evaluation instrument as retrieval techniques have\nadvanced.",

Through imitating a large teacher\nmodel, a lightweight student model can achieve comparable performance with more\nefficiency. However, most existing knowledge distillation methods are focused\non classification tasks. Only a limited number of studies have applied\nknowledge distillation to object detection, especially in time-sensitive\nautonomous driving scenarios. We propose the Adaptive Instance Distillation\n(AID) method to selectively impart knowledge from the teacher to the student\nfor improving the performance of knowledge distillation. Unlike previous KD\nmethods that treat all instances equally, our AID can attentively adjust the\ndistillation weights of instances based on the teacher model's prediction loss.\nWe verified the effectiveness of our AID method through experiments on the\nKITTI and the COCO traffic datasets. The results show that our method improves\nthe performance of existing state-of-the-art attention-guided and non-local\ndistillation methods and achieves better distillation results on both\nsingle-stage and two-stage detectors.

We modify a post-training\nneural-network quantization method, GPFQ, that is based on a greedy\npath-following mechanism, and rigorously analyze its error. We prove that for\nquantizing a single-layer network, the relative square error essentially decays\nlinearly in the number of weights -- i.e., level of over-parametrization. Our\nresult holds across a range of input distributions and for both fully-connected\nand convolutional architectures. To empirically evaluate the method, we\nquantize several common architectures with few bits per weight, and test them\non ImageNet, showing only minor loss of accuracy. We also demonstrate that\nstandard modifications, such as bias correction and mixed precision\nquantization, further improve accuracy.",

    "title": "Natural Language Descriptions of Deep Visual Features",
    "abstract": "Some neurons in deep networks specialize in recognizing highly specific\nperceptual, structural, or semantic features of inputs. In computer vision,\ntechniques exist for identifying neurons that respond to individual concept\ncategories like colors, textures, and object classes. But these techniques are\nlimited in scope, labeling only a small subset of neurons and behaviors in any\nnetwork. Is a richer characterization of neuron-level computation possible? We\nintroduce a procedure (called MILAN, for mutual-information-guided linguistic\nannotation of neurons) that automatically labels neurons with open-ended,\ncompositional, natural language descriptions. Given a neuron, MILAN generates a\ndescription by searching for a natural language string that maximizes pointwise\nmutual information with the image regions in which the neuron is active. MILAN\nproduces fine-grained descriptions that capture categorical, relational, and\nlogical structure in learned features. These descriptions obtain high agreement\nwith human-generated feature descriptions across a diverse set of model\narchitectures and tasks, and can aid in understanding and controlling learned\nmodels. We highlight three applications of natural language neuron\ndescriptions. First, we use MILAN for analysis, characterizing the distribution\nand importance of neurons selective for attribute, category, and relational\ninformation in vision models. Second, we use MILAN for auditing, surfacing\nneurons sensitive to protected categories like race and gender in models\ntrained on datasets intended to obscure these features. Finally, we use MILAN\nfor editing, improving robustness in an image classifier by deleting neurons\nsensitive to text features spuriously correlated with class labels.",

Natural questions\narise concerning how to characterize these arrangements - are they ordered or\ndisordered? If they are ordered, how are they ordered and what kinds of defects\ndo they possess? Originally introduced to study problems in pure mathematics,\nVoronoi tessellations have become a powerful and versatile tool for analyzing\ncountless problems in pure and applied physics.

    "abstract": "Spatial road networks have been widely employed to model the structure and\nconnectivity of cities. In such representation, the question of spatial scale\nof the entities in the network, i.e. what its nodes and edges actually embody\nin reality, is of particular importance so that redundant information can be\nidentified and eliminated to provide an improved understanding of city\nstructure. To address this, we investigate in this work the relationship\nbetween the spatial scale of the modelled network entities against the amount\nof useful information contained within it. We employ an entropy measure from\ncomplexity science and information theory to quantify the amount of information\nresiding in each presentation of the network subject to the spatial scale and\nshow that it peaks at some intermediate scale. The resulting network\npresentation would allow us to have direct intuition over the hierarchical\nstructure of the urban organisation, which is otherwise not immediately\navailable from the traditional simple road network presentation. We demonstrate\nour methodology on the Singapore road network and find the critical spatial\nscale to be 85 m, at which the network obtained corresponds very well to the\nplanning boundaries used by the local urban planners, revealing the essential\nurban connectivity structure of the city. Furthermore, the complexity measure\nis also capable of informing the secondary transitions that correspond well to\nhigher-level hierarchical structures associated with larger-scale urban\nplanning boundaries in Singapore.",

    "abstract": "This study assesses a Continuous Data Assimilation (CDA)\ndynamical-downscaling algorithm for enhancing the simulation of the Indian\nsummer monsoon (ISM) system. CDA is a mathematically rigorous technique that\nhas been recently introduced to constrain the large-scale features of\nhigh-resolution atmospheric models with coarse spatial scale data. It is\nsimilar to spectral nudging but does not require any spectral decomposition for\nscales separation. This is expected to be particularly relevant for ISM, which\ninvolves various interactions between large-scale circulations and regional\nphysical processes. Along with a control simulation, several downscaling\nsimulations were conducted with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)\nmodel using CDA, spectral (retaining different wavenumbers) and grid nudging\nfor three ISM seasons: normal (2016), excess (2013), and drought (2009). The\nsimulations are nested within the NCEP Final Analysis and the model outputs are\nevaluated against the observations. Compared to grid and spectral nudging, the\nsimulations using CDA produce enhanced ISM features over the Indian\nsubcontinent including the low-level jet, tropical easterly jet, easterly wind\nshear, and rainfall distributions for all investigated ISM seasons. The major\nISM processes, in particular the monsoon inversion over the Arabian Sea,\ntropospheric temperature gradients and moist static energy over central India,\nand zonal wind shear over the monsoon region, are all better simulated with\nCDA. Spectral nudging outputs are found to be sensitive to the choice of the\nwavenumber, requiring careful tuning to provide robust simulations of the ISM\nsystem. In contrast, control and grid nudging generally fail to well reproduce\nsome of the main ISM features.",

Whereas various network variants with overall\npromising results in the field of medical image segmentation have been\ndeveloped over the last years, almost all of them struggle with the challenge\nof accurately segmenting hepatic lesions. This lead to the idea of combining\nelements of convolutional and transformerbased architectures to overcome the\nexisting limitations. This work presents a hybrid network called SWTR-Unet,\nconsisting of a pretrained ResNet, transformer blocks as well as a common\nUnet-style decoder path. This network was applied to clinical liver MRI, as\nwell as to the publicly available CT data of the liver tumor segmentation\n(LiTS) challenge. Additionally, multiple state-of-the-art networks were\nimplemented and applied to both datasets, ensuring a direct comparability.\nFurthermore, correlation analysis and an ablation study were carried out, to\ninvestigate various influencing factors on the segmentation accuracy of our\npresented method. With Dice similarity scores of averaged 98 +- 2 % for liver\nand 81 +- 28 % lesion segmentation on the MRI dataset and 97 +- 2 % and 79 +-\n25 %, respectively on the CT dataset, the proposed SWTR-Unet outperforms each\nof the additionally implemented state-of-the-art networks. The achieved\nsegmentation accuracy was found to be on par with manually performed expert\nsegmentations as indicated by interobserver variabilities for liver lesion\nsegmentation.

    "abstract": "We revisit the theory of importance weighted variational inference (IWVI), a\npromising strategy for learning latent variable models. IWVI uses new\nvariational bounds, known as Monte Carlo objectives (MCOs), obtained by\nreplacing intractable integrals by Monte Carlo estimates -- usually simply\nobtained via importance sampling. Burda, Grosse and Salakhutdinov (2016) showed\nthat increasing the number of importance samples provably tightens the gap\nbetween the bound and the likelihood. Inspired by this simple monotonicity\ntheorem, we present a series of nonasymptotic results that link properties of\nMonte Carlo estimates to tightness of MCOs. We challenge the rationale that\nsmaller Monte Carlo variance leads to better bounds. We confirm theoretically\nthe empirical findings of several recent papers by showing that, in a precise\nsense, negative correlation reduces the variational gap. We also generalise the\noriginal monotonicity theorem by considering non-uniform weights. We discuss\nseveral practical consequences of our theoretical results.

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel, probabilistic binary latent variable model to detect\nnoisy or approximate repeats of patterns in sparse binary data. The model is\nbased on the \"Noisy-OR model\" (Heckerman, 1990), used previously for disease\nand topic modelling. The model's capability is demonstrated by extracting\nstructure in recordings from retinal neurons, but it can be widely applied to\ndiscover and model latent structure in noisy binary data. In the context of\nspiking neural data, the task is to \"explain\" spikes of individual neurons in\nterms of groups of neurons, \"Cell Assemblies\" (CAs), that often fire together,\ndue to mutual interactions or other causes. The model infers sparse activity in\na set of binary latent variables, each describing the activity of a cell\nassembly. When the latent variable of a cell assembly is active, it reduces the\nprobabilities of neurons belonging to this assembly to be inactive. The\nconditional probability kernels of the latent components are learned from the\ndata in an expectation maximization scheme, involving inference of latent\nstates and parameter adjustments to the model. We thoroughly validate the model\non synthesized spike trains constructed to statistically resemble recorded\nretinal responses to white noise stimulus and natural movie stimulus in data.\nWe also apply our model to spiking responses recorded in retinal ganglion cells\n(RGCs) during stimulation with a movie and discuss the found structure.",
