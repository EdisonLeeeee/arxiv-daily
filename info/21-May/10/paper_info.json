    "title": "Reentrancy Vulnerability Identification in Ethereum Smart Contracts",
    "abstract": "Ethereum Smart contracts use blockchain to transfer values among peers on\nnetworks without central agency. These programs are deployed on decentralized\napplications running on top of the blockchain consensus protocol to enable\npeople to make agreements in a transparent and conflict-free environment. The\nsecurity vulnerabilities within those smart contracts are a potential threat to\nthe applications and have caused huge financial losses to their users. In this\npaper, we present a framework that combines static and dynamic analysis to\ndetect Reentrancy vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts. This framework\ngenerates an attacker contract based on the ABI specifications of smart\ncontracts under test and analyzes the contract interaction to precisely report\nReentrancy vulnerability. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of our proposed\nframework on 5 modified smart contracts from Etherscan and our framework was\nable to detect the Reentrancy vulnerability in all our modified contracts. Our\nframework analyzes smart contracts statically to identify potentially\nvulnerable functions and then uses dynamic analysis to precisely confirm\nReentrancy vulnerability, thus achieving increased performance and reduced\nfalse positives.",

    "abstract": "Search engines could consistently favor certain values over the others, which\nis considered as biased due to the built-in infrastructures. Many studies have\nbeen dedicated to detect, control, and mitigate the impacts of the biases from\nthe perspectives of search engines themselves. In our study, we take the\nperspective from end-users to analyze their perceptions of search engine biases\nand their satisfaction when the biases are regulated. In the study, we paired a\nreal search page from search engine Bing with a synthesized page that has more\ndiversities in the results (i.e. less biased). Both pages show the top-10\nsearch items given search queries and we asked participants which one do they\nprefer and why do they prefer the one selected. Statistical analyses revealed\nthat overall, participants prefer the original Bing pages and the locations\nwhere the diversities are introduced are also associated with users'\npreferences. We found out that users prefer results that are more consistent\nand relevant to the search queries. Introducing diversities undermines the\nrelevance of the search results and impairs users' satisfaction to some degree.\nAdditionally, we confirmed that users tend to pay more attention to the top\nportion of the results than the bottom ones.",

    "abstract": "Electric Vehicles (EVs) can help alleviate our reliance on fossil fuels for\ntransport and electricity systems. However, charging millions of EV batteries\nrequires management to prevent overloading the electricity grid and minimise\ncostly upgrades that are ultimately paid for by consumers.\nManaged chargers, such as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) chargers, allow control over\nthe time, speed and direction of charging. Such control assists in balancing\nelectricity supply and demand across a green electricity system and could\nreduce costs for consumers.\nSmart and V2G chargers connect EVs to the power grid using a charging device\nwhich includes a data connection to exchange information and control commands\nbetween various entities in the EV ecosystem. This introduces data privacy\nconcerns and is a potential target for cyber-security attacks. Therefore, the\nimplementation of a secure system is crucial to permit both consumers and\nelectricity system operators to trust smart charging and V2G.\nIn principle, we already have the technology needed for a connected EV\ncharging infrastructure to be securely enabled, borrowing best practices from\nthe Internet and industrial control systems. We must properly adapt the\nsecurity technology to take into account the challenges peculiar to the EV\ncharging infrastructure. Challenges go beyond technical considerations and\nother issues arise such as balancing trade-offs between security and other\ndesirable qualities such as interoperability, scalability, crypto-agility,\naffordability and energy efficiency.\nThis document reviews security and privacy topics relevant to the EV charging\necosystem with a focus on smart charging and V2G.",

As one application, we obtain a complete derandomization of\nNoether's normalization lemma for varieties of bounded degree in a projective\nor affine $n$-space. In another application, we obtain a simple polynomial-time\nblack-box PIT algorithm for depth-4 arithmetic circuits with bounded top fan-in\nand bottom fan-in that are not in the Sylvester-Gallai configuration, improving\nand simplifying a result of Gupta (ECCC TR 14-130).\nAs a complement of our explicit construction, we prove a lower bound for the\nsize of $k$-subspace families that are evasive for degree-$d$ varieties in a\nprojective $n$-space. When $n-k=\\Omega(n)$, the lower bound is superpolynomial\nunless $d$ is bounded. The proof uses a dimension-counting argument on Chow\nvarieties that parametrize projective subvarieties.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a model containing modifications to the\nSignal-passing Tile Assembly Model (STAM), a tile-based self-assembly model\nwhose tiles are capable of activating and deactivating glues based on the\nbinding of other glues. These modifications consist of an extension to 3D, the\nability of tiles to form \"flexible\" bonds that allow bound tiles to rotate\nrelative to each other, and allowing tiles of multiple shapes within the same\nsystem. We call this new model the STAM*, and we present a series of\nconstructions within it that are capable of self-replicating behavior. Namely,\nthe input seed assemblies to our STAM* systems can encode either \"genomes\"\nspecifying the instructions for building a target shape, or can be copies of\nthe target shape with instructions built in. A universal tile set exists for\nany target shape (at scale factor 2), and from a genome assembly creates\ninfinite copies of the genome as well as the target shape. An input target\nstructure, on the other hand, can be \"deconstructed\" by the universal tile set\nto form a genome encoding it, which will then replicate and also initiate the\ngrowth of copies of assemblies of the target shape. Since the lengths of the\ngenomes for these constructions are proportional to the number of points in the\ntarget shape, we also present a replicator which utilizes hierarchical\nself-assembly to greatly reduce the size of the genomes required. The main\ngoals of this work are to examine minimal requirements of self-assembling\nsystems capable of self-replicating behavior, with the aim of better\nunderstanding self-replication in nature as well as understanding the\ncomplexity of mimicking it.",

    "abstract": "Industry is moving towards large-scale system-on-chip (SoC) designs where\nheterogeneous components such as processor cores, DSPs, memory controllers, and\naccelerator units are bundled via 2.5D integration. That is, these components\nare fabricated separately onto chiplets and then integrated using an\ninterconnect carrier, a so-called interposer. Independently, however,\ngeneral-purpose SoC architectures have raised significant security concerns.\nTherefore, with many IP modules and hardware components coming from various\nthird-party vendors and manufacturers, ensuring security and integrity of\nchiplets-based system is a grand challenge. Further, malicious software running\nwithin a chiplet can pose significant risks as well. In this work, we propose\nto leverage an active interposer as secure-by-construction, generic root of\ntrust platform for such modern systems. Our work presents a new architectural\nframework where untrusted processing elements, running untrusted code, are\nintegrated on top of such an interposer-based root of trust, allowing us to\ndetect and prevent any form of malicious messages exchanged between the\nheterogeneous components. Our technique has limited design overhead that is\nfurthermore restricted to the active interposer, allowing the heterogeneous\ncomponents within chiplets to remain untouched.

    "abstract": "The increasing amount of data generated at the edge/client nodes and the\nprivacy concerns have resulted in learning at the edge, in which the\ncomputations are performed at edge devices and are communicated to a central\nnode for updating the model. The edge nodes have low bandwidth and may be\navailable only intermittently. There are helper nodes present in the network\nthat aid the edge nodes in the communication to the server. The edge nodes\ncommunicate the local gradient to helper nodes which relay these messages to\nthe central node after possible aggregation. Recently, schemes using repetition\ncodes and maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes, respectively known as Aligned\nMDS Coding (AMC) scheme and Aligend Repetition Coding (ARC) scheme, were\nproposed. It was observed that in AMC scheme the communication between edge\nnodes and helper nodes is optimal but with an increased cost of communication\nbetween helper and master. An upper bound on the communication cost between\nhelpers and master was obtained. In this paper, a tradeoff between\ncommunication costs at edge nodes and helper nodes is established with the help\nof pyramid codes, a well-known class of locally repairable codes. The\ncommunication costs at both the helper nodes and edge nodes are exactly\ncharacterized. Using the developed technique, the exact communication cost at\nhelper nodes can be computed for the scheme using MDS codes. In the end, we\nprovide two improved aggregation strategies for the existing AMC and ARC\nschemes, yielding significant reduction in communication cost at helpers,\nwithout changing any of the code parameters.",

    "abstract": "Several emerging PoW blockchain protocols rely on a \"parallel-chain\"\narchitecture for scaling, where instead of a single chain, multiple chains are\nrun in parallel and aggregated. A key requirement of practical PoW blockchains\nis to adapt to mining power variations over time. In this paper, we consider\nthe design of provably secure parallel-chain protocols which can adapt to such\nmining power variations.\nThe Bitcoin difficulty adjustment rule adjusts the difficulty target of block\nmining periodically to get a constant mean inter-block time. While\nsuperficially simple, the rule has proved itself to be sophisticated and\nsuccessfully secure, both in practice and in theory. We show that natural\nadaptations of the Bitcoin adjustment rule to the parallel-chain case open the\ndoor to subtle, but catastrophic safety and liveness breaches. We uncover a\nmeta-design principle that allow us to design variable mining difficulty\nprotocols for three popular PoW blockchain proposals (Prism, OHIE, and\nFruitchains) inside a common rubric.\nThe principle has three components:(M1) a pivot chain, based on which blocks\nin all chains choose difficulty, (M2) a monotonicity condition for referencing\npivot chain blocks and (M3) translating additional protocol aspects from using\nlevels (depth) to using \"difficulty levels\". We show that protocols employing a\nsubset of these principles may have catastrophic failures. The security of the\ndesigns is also proved using a common rubric - the key technical challenge\ninvolves analyzing the interaction between the pivot chain and the other\nchains, as well as bounding the sudden changes in difficulty target experienced\nin non-pivot chains. We empirically investigate the responsivity of the new\nmining difficulty rule via simulations based on historical Bitcoin data, and\nfind that the protocol very effectively controls the forking rate across all\nthe chains.",

    "abstract": "Climate models project an uncertainty range of possible warming scenarios\nfrom 1.5 to 5 degree Celsius global temperature increase until 2100, according\nto the CMIP6 model ensemble. Climate risk management and infrastructure\nadaptation requires the accurate quantification of the uncertainties at the\nlocal level. Ensembles of high-resolution climate models could accurately\nquantify the uncertainties, but most physics-based climate models are\ncomputationally too expensive to run as ensemble. Recent works in\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have combined deep learning and the\nphysical sciences to learn up to 15k faster copies of climate submodels.\nHowever, the application of PINNs in climate modeling has so far been mostly\nlimited to deterministic models. We leverage a novel method that combines\npolynomial chaos expansion (PCE), a classic technique for uncertainty\npropagation, with PINNs. The PCE-PINNs learn a fast surrogate model that is\ndemonstrated for uncertainty propagation of known parameter uncertainties. We\nshowcase the effectiveness in ocean modeling by using the local\nadvection-diffusion equation.",

    "title": "Understanding Catastrophic Overfitting in Adversarial Training",
    "abstract": "Recently, FGSM adversarial training is found to be able to train a robust\nmodel which is comparable to the one trained by PGD but an order of magnitude\nfaster. However, there is a failure mode called catastrophic overfitting (CO)\nthat the classifier loses its robustness suddenly during the training and\nhardly recovers by itself. In this paper, we find CO is not only limited to\nFGSM, but also happens in $\\mbox{DF}^{\\infty}$-1 adversarial training. Then, we\nanalyze the geometric properties for both FGSM and $\\mbox{DF}^{\\infty}$-1 and\nfind they have totally different decision boundaries after CO. For FGSM, a new\ndecision boundary is generated along the direction of perturbation and makes\nthe small perturbation more effective than the large one. While for\n$\\mbox{DF}^{\\infty}$-1, there is no new decision boundary generated along the\ndirection of perturbation, instead the perturbation generated by\n$\\mbox{DF}^{\\infty}$-1 becomes smaller after CO and thus loses its\neffectiveness. We also experimentally analyze three hypotheses on potential\nfactors causing CO. And then based on the empirical analysis, we modify the\nRS-FGSM by not projecting perturbation back to the $l_\\infty$ ball. By this\nsmall modification, we could achieve $47.56 \\pm 0.37\\% $ PGD-50-10 accuracy on\nCIFAR10 with $\\epsilon=8/255$ in contrast to $43.57 \\pm 0.30\\% $ by RS-FGSM and\nalso further extend the working range of $\\epsilon$ from 8/255 to 11/255 on\nCIFAR10 without CO occurring.",

    "abstract": "Semantics has become a key topic of research in Genetic Programming (GP).\nSemantics refers to the outputs (behaviour) of a GP individual when this is run\non a data set. The majority of works that focus on semantic diversity in\nsingle-objective GP indicates that it is highly beneficial in evolutionary\nsearch. Surprisingly, there is minuscule research conducted in semantics in\nMulti-objective GP (MOGP). In this work we make a leap beyond our understanding\nof semantics in MOGP and propose SDO: Semantic-based Distance as an additional\ncriteriOn. This naturally encourages semantic diversity in MOGP. To do so, we\nfind a pivot in the less dense region of the first Pareto front (most promising\nfront). This is then used to compute a distance between the pivot and every\nindividual in the population. The resulting distance is then used as an\nadditional criterion to be optimised to favour semantic diversity. We also use\ntwo other semantic-based methods as baselines, called Semantic Similarity-based\nCrossover and Semantic-based Crowding Distance. Furthermore, we also use the\nNSGA-II and the SPEA2 for comparison too. We use highly unbalanced binary\nclassification problems and consistently show how our proposed SDO approach\nproduces more non-dominated solutions and better diversity, leading to better\nstatistically significant results, using the hypervolume results as evaluation\nmeasure, compared to the rest of the other four methods.",

    "abstract": "Two-sided marketplaces are an important component of many existing Internet\nservices like Airbnb and Amazon, which have both consumers (e.g. users) and\nproducers (e.g. retailers). Traditionally, the recommendation system in these\nplatforms mainly focuses on maximizing customer satisfaction by recommending\nthe most relevant items based on the learned user preference. However, it has\nbeen shown in previous works that solely optimizing the satisfaction of\ncustomers may lead to unfair exposure of items, which jeopardizes the benefits\nof producers. To tackle this problem, we propose a fairness-aware\nrecommendation framework by using multi-objective optimization, Multi-FR, to\nadaptively balance the objectives between consumers and producers. In\nparticular, Multi-FR adopts the multi-gradient descent to generate a Pareto set\nof solutions, where the most appropriate one is selected from the Pareto set.\nIn addition, four fairness metrics/constraints are applied to make the\nrecommendation results on both the consumer and producer side fair. We\nextensively evaluate our model on three real-world datasets, comparing with\ngrid-search methods and using a variety of performance metrics. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that Multi-FR can improve the recommendation\nfairness on both the consumer and producer side with little drop in\nrecommendation quality, also outperforming several state-of-the-art fair\nranking approaches.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are computationally and memory intensive, which\nmakes their hardware implementation a challenging task especially for resource\nconstrained devices such as IoT nodes. To address this challenge, this paper\nintroduces a new method to improve DNNs performance by fusing approximate\ncomputing with data reuse techniques to be used for image recognition\napplications. DNNs weights are approximated based on the linear and quadratic\napproximation methods during the training phase, then, all of the weights are\nreplaced with the linear/quadratic coefficients to execute the inference in a\nway where different weights could be computed using the same coefficients. This\nleads to a repetition of the weights across the processing element (PE) array,\nwhich in turn enables the reuse of the DNN sub-computations (computational\nreuse) and leverage the same data (data reuse) to reduce DNNs computations,\nmemory accesses, and improve energy efficiency albeit at the cost of increased\ntraining time. Complete analysis for both MNIST and CIFAR 10 datasets is\npresented for image recognition , where LeNet 5 revealed a reduction in the\nnumber of parameters by a factor of 1211.3x with a drop of less than 0.9% in\naccuracy. When compared to the state of the art Row Stationary (RS) method, the\nproposed architecture saved 54% of the total number of adders and multipliers\nneeded.

    "abstract": "Efficient video processing is a critical component in many IoMT applications\nto detect events of interest. Presently, many window optimization techniques\nhave been proposed in event processing with an underlying assumption that the\nincoming stream has a structured data model. Videos are highly complex due to\nthe lack of any underlying structured data model. Video stream sources such as\nCCTV cameras and smartphones are resource-constrained edge nodes. At the same\ntime, video content extraction is expensive and requires computationally\nintensive Deep Neural Network (DNN) models that are primarily deployed at\nhigh-end (or cloud) nodes. This paper presents VID-WIN, an adaptive 2-stage\nallied windowing approach to accelerate video event analytics in an edge-cloud\nparadigm. VID-WIN runs parallelly across edge and cloud nodes and performs the\nquery and resource-aware optimization for state-based complex event matching.\nVID-WIN exploits the video content and DNN input knobs to accelerate the video\ninference process across nodes. The paper proposes a novel content-driven\nmicro-batch resizing, queryaware caching and micro-batch based utility\nfiltering strategy of video frames under resource-constrained edge nodes to\nimprove the overall system throughput, latency, and network usage. Extensive\nevaluations are performed over five real-world datasets. The experimental\nresults show that VID-WIN video event matching achieves ~2.3X higher throughput\nwith minimal latency and ~99% bandwidth reduction compared to other baselines\nwhile maintaining query-level accuracy and resource bounds.",

However, they have been ignored in\nthe 3D style research. Existing 3D style metrics typically operate on meshes or\npointclouds, and fail to account for end-user subjectivity by adopting fixed\ndefinitions of style, either through crowd-sourcing for style labels or\nhand-crafted features. We propose UVStyle-Net, a style similarity measure for\nB-Reps that leverages the style signals in the second order statistics of the\nactivations in a pre-trained (unsupervised) 3D encoder, and learns their\nrelative importance to a subjective end-user through few-shot learning.

More importantly, the few-shot\nlearning accounts for the inherent subjectivity associated with style. We show\nquantitatively that our proposed method with B-Reps is able to capture stronger\nstyle signals than alternative methods on meshes and pointclouds despite its\nsignificantly greater computational efficiency. We also show it is able to\ngenerate meaningful style gradients with respect to the input shape, and that\nfew-shot learning with as few as two positive examples selected by an end-user\nis sufficient to significantly improve the style measure.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks often suffer from overconfidence which can be partly\nremedied by improved out-of-distribution detection. For this purpose, we\npropose a novel approach that allows for the generation of out-of-distribution\ndatasets based on a given in-distribution dataset. This new dataset can then be\nused to improve out-of-distribution detection for the given dataset and machine\nlearning task at hand. The samples in this dataset are with respect to the\nfeature space close to the in-distribution dataset and therefore realistic and\nplausible. Hence, this dataset can also be used to safeguard neural networks,\ni.e., to validate the generalization performance. Our approach first generates\nsuitable representations of an in-distribution dataset using an autoencoder and\nthen transforms them using our novel proposed Soft Brownian Offset method.\nAfter transformation, the decoder part of the autoencoder allows for the\ngeneration of these implicit out-of-distribution samples. This newly generated\ndataset then allows for mixing with other datasets and thus improved training\nof an out-of-distribution classifier, increasing its performance.\nExperimentally, we show that our approach is promising for time series using\nsynthetic data. Using our new method, we also show in a quantitative case study\nthat we can improve the out-of-distribution detection for the MNIST dataset.\nFinally, we provide another case study on the synthetic generation of\nout-of-distribution trajectories, which can be used to validate trajectory\nprediction algorithms for automated driving.",

Among these networks,\nthe arguably most widespread approach is so-called prototype learning, where\nsimilarities to learned latent prototypes serve as the basis of classifying an\nunseen data point. In this work, we point to an important shortcoming of such\napproaches. Namely, there is a semantic gap between similarity in latent space\nand similarity in input space, which can corrupt interpretability. We design\ntwo experiments that exemplify this issue on the so-called ProtoPNet.\nSpecifically, we find that this network's interpretability mechanism can be led\nastray by intentionally crafted or even JPEG compression artefacts, which can\nproduce incomprehensible decisions.

    "abstract": "A growing body of literature has proposed formal approaches to audit\nalgorithmic systems for biased and harmful behaviors. While formal auditing\napproaches have been greatly impactful, they often suffer major blindspots,\nwith critical issues surfacing only in the context of everyday use once systems\nare deployed. Recent years have seen many cases in which everyday users of\nalgorithmic systems detect and raise awareness about harmful behaviors that\nthey encounter in the course of their everyday interactions with these systems.\nHowever, to date little academic attention has been granted to these bottom-up,\nuser-driven auditing processes. In this paper, we propose and explore the\nconcept of everyday algorithm auditing, a process in which users detect,\nunderstand, and interrogate problematic machine behaviors via their day-to-day\ninteractions with algorithmic systems. We argue that everyday users are\npowerful in surfacing problematic machine behaviors that may elude detection\nvia more centrally-organized forms of auditing, regardless of users' knowledge\nabout the underlying algorithms. We analyze several real-world cases of\neveryday algorithm auditing, drawing lessons from these cases for the design of\nfuture platforms and tools that facilitate such auditing behaviors. Finally, we\ndiscuss work that lies ahead, toward bridging the gaps between formal auditing\napproaches and the organic auditing behaviors that emerge in everyday use of\nalgorithmic systems.",

    "abstract": "Readers of academic research papers often read with the goal of answering\nspecific questions. Question Answering systems that can answer those questions\ncan make consumption of the content much more efficient. However, building such\ntools requires data that reflect the difficulty of the task arising from\ncomplex reasoning about claims made in multiple parts of a paper. In contrast,\nexisting information-seeking question answering datasets usually contain\nquestions about generic factoid-type information. We therefore present QASPER,\na dataset of 5,049 questions over 1,585 Natural Language Processing papers.\nEach question is written by an NLP practitioner who read only the title and\nabstract of the corresponding paper, and the question seeks information present\nin the full text. The questions are then answered by a separate set of NLP\npractitioners who also provide supporting evidence to answers. We find that\nexisting models that do well on other QA tasks do not perform well on answering\nthese questions, underperforming humans by at least 27 F1 points when answering\nthem from entire papers, motivating further research in document-grounded,\ninformation-seeking QA, which our dataset is designed to facilitate.",

Second, for the case of isotropic noise (i.e., noise with a\ndiagonal scalar covariance matrix), the rates of convergence of the probability\nof error are characterized in the high and low noise regimes. In the low noise\nregime, for every dimension n, the probability of error is shown to behave\nproportionally to {\\sigma}, where {\\sigma} is the noise standard deviation.\nMoreover, the slope is computed exactly for several distributions and it is\nshown to behave quadratically in n.

In order to reduce the spread\nof coronavirus, people often wear masks to protect themselves. This makes face\nrecognition a very difficult task since certain parts of the face are hidden. A\nprimary focus of researchers during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is to come\nup with suggestions to handle this problem through rapid and efficient\nsolutions. In this paper, we propose a reliable method based on occlusion\nremoval and deep learning-based features in order to address the problem of the\nmasked face recognition process. The first step is to remove the masked face\nregion. Next, we apply three pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN) namely, VGG-16, AlexNet, and ResNet-50, and use them to extract deep\nfeatures from the obtained regions (mostly eyes and forehead regions). The\nBag-of-features paradigm is then applied to the feature maps of the last\nconvolutional layer in order to quantize them and to get a slight\nrepresentation comparing to the fully connected layer of classical CNN.\nFinally, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is applied for the classification process.\nExperimental results on Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset show high recognition\nperformance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",

The fastest algorithm for solving the LCS problem exactly runs\nin essentially quadratic time in the length of the input, and it is known that\nunder the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis the quadratic running time cannot\nbe beaten. There are no such limitations for the approximate computation of the\nLCS however, except in some limited scenarios. There is also a scarcity of\napproximation algorithms. When the two given strings are over an alphabet of\nsize $k$, returning the subsequence formed by the most frequent symbol\noccurring in both strings achieves a $1/k$ approximation for the LCS. It is an\nopen problem whether a better than $1/k$ approximation can be achieved in truly\nsubquadratic time ($O(n^{2-\\delta})$ time for constant $\\delta>0$).\nA recent result [Rubinstein and Song SODA'2020] showed that a $1/2+\\epsilon$\napproximation for the LCS over a binary alphabet is possible in truly\nsubquadratic time, provided the input strings have the same length. In this\npaper we show that if a $1/2+\\epsilon$ approximation (for $\\epsilon>0$) is\nachievable for binary LCS in truly subquadratic time when the input strings can\nbe unequal, then for every constant $k$, there is a truly subquadratic time\nalgorithm that achieves a $1/k+\\delta$ approximation for $k$-ary alphabet LCS\nfor some $\\delta>0$. Thus the binary case is the hardest.

    "abstract": "With recent advancements in deep learning methods, automatically learning\ndeep features from the original data is becoming an effective and widespread\napproach. However, the hand-crafted expert knowledge-based features are still\ninsightful. These expert-curated features can increase the model's\ngeneralization and remind the model of some data characteristics, such as the\ntime interval between two patterns. It is particularly advantageous in tasks\nwith the clinically-relevant data, where the data are usually limited and\ncomplex. To keep both implicit deep features and expert-curated explicit\nfeatures together, an effective fusion strategy is becoming indispensable. In\nthis work, we focus on a specific clinical application, i.e., sleep apnea\ndetection. In this context, we propose a contrastive learning-based cross\nattention framework for sleep apnea detection (named ConCAD). The cross\nattention mechanism can fuse the deep and expert features by automatically\nassigning attention weights based on their importance. Contrastive learning can\nlearn better representations by keeping the instances of each class closer and\npushing away instances from different classes in the embedding space\nconcurrently. Furthermore, a new hybrid loss is designed to simultaneously\nconduct contrastive learning and classification by integrating a supervised\ncontrastive loss with a cross-entropy loss. Our proposed framework can be\neasily integrated into standard deep learning models to utilize expert\nknowledge and contrastive learning to boost performance.

This technique of action\nrepetition has several merits in training the agent, but the data between\naction-decision points (i.e., intermediate frames) are, in effect, discarded.\nSince the amount of training data is inversely proportional to the interval of\naction repeats, they can have a negative impact on the sample efficiency of\ntraining. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective approach to\nalleviate to this problem by introducing the concept of pseudo-actions. The key\nidea of our method is making the transition between action-decision points\nusable as training data by considering pseudo-actions.

Thus, generalizable person Re-ID has recently drawn\nincreasing attention, which trains a model on source domains that generalizes\nwell on unseen target domain without model updating. In this work, we propose a\nnovel adaptive domain-specific normalization approach (AdsNorm) for\ngeneralizable person Re-ID. It describes unseen target domain as a combination\nof the known source ones, and explicitly learns domain-specific representation\nwith target distribution to improve the model's generalization by a\nmeta-learning pipeline. Specifically, AdsNorm utilizes batch normalization\nlayers to collect individual source domains' characteristics, and maps source\ndomains into a shared latent space by using these characteristics, where the\ndomain relevance is measured by a distance function of different\ndomain-specific normalization statistics and features. At the testing stage,\nAdsNorm projects images from unseen target domain into the same latent space,\nand adaptively integrates the domain-specific features carrying the source\ndistributions by domain relevance for learning more generalizable aggregated\nrepresentation on unseen target domain. Considering that target domain is\nunavailable during training, a meta-learning algorithm combined with a\ncustomized relation loss is proposed to optimize an effective and efficient\nensemble model.

    "abstract": "A multivariate density forecast model based on deep learning is designed in\nthis paper to forecast the joint cumulative distribution functions (JCDFs) of\nmultiple security margins in power systems. Differing from existing\nmultivariate density forecast models, the proposed method requires no a priori\nhypotheses on the distribution of forecasting targets. In addition, based on\nthe universal approximation capability of neural networks, the value domain of\nthe proposed approach has been proven to include all continuous JCDFs. The\nforecasted JCDF is further employed to calculate the deterministic security\nassessment index evaluating the security level of future power system\noperations. Numerical tests verify the superiority of the proposed method over\ncurrent multivariate density forecast models. The deterministic security\nassessment index is demonstrated to be more informative for operators than\nsecurity margins as well.",

    "abstract": "Single object tracking (SOT) is currently one of the most important tasks in\ncomputer vision. With the development of the deep network and the release for a\nseries of large scale datasets for single object tracking, siamese networks\nhave been proposed and perform better than most of the traditional methods.\nHowever, recent siamese networks get deeper and slower to obtain better\nperformance. Most of these methods could only meet the needs of real-time\nobject tracking in ideal environments. In order to achieve a better balance\nbetween efficiency and accuracy, we propose a simpler siamese network for\nsingle object tracking, which runs fast in poor hardware configurations while\nremaining an excellent accuracy. We use a more efficient regression method to\ncompute the location of the tracked object in a shorter time without losing\nmuch precision. For improving the accuracy and speeding up the training\nprogress, we introduce the Squeeze-and-excitation (SE) network into the feature\nextractor. In this paper, we compare the proposed method with some\nstate-of-the-art trackers and analysis their performances. Using our method, a\nsiamese network could be trained with shorter time and less data. The fast\nprocessing speed enables combining object tracking with object detection or\nother tasks in real time.",

    "abstract": "This work considers a novel information design problem and studies how the\ncraft of payoff-relevant environmental signals solely can influence the\nbehaviors of intelligent agents. The agents' strategic interactions are\ncaptured by an incomplete-information Markov game, in which each agent first\nselects one environmental signal from multiple signal sources as additional\npayoff-relevant information and then takes an action. There is a rational\ninformation designer (principal) who possesses one signal source and aims to\ncontrol the equilibrium behaviors of the agents by designing the information\nstructure of her signals sent to the agents. An obedient principle is\nestablished which states that it is without loss of generality to focus on the\ndirect information design when the information design incentivizes each agent\nto select the signal sent by the principal, such that the design process avoids\nthe predictions of the agents' strategic selection behaviors. Based on the\nobedient principle, we introduce the design protocol given a goal of the\nprincipal referred to as obedient implementability (OIL) and study a Myersonian\ninformation design that characterizes the OIL in a class of obedient sequential\nMarkov perfect Bayesian equilibria (O-SMPBE). A framework is proposed based on\nan approach which we refer to as the fixed-point alignment that incentivizes\nthe agents to choose the signal sent by the principal, makes sure that the\nagents' policy profile of taking actions is the policy component of an O-SMPBE,\nand the principal's goal is achieved.

    "abstract": "This paper identifies and addresses a serious design bias of existing salient\nobject detection (SOD) datasets, which unrealistically assume that each image\nshould contain at least one clear and uncluttered salient object. This design\nbias has led to a saturation in performance for state-of-the-art SOD models\nwhen evaluated on existing datasets. However, these models are still far from\nsatisfactory when applied to real-world scenes. Based on our analyses, we\npropose a new high-quality dataset and update the previous saliency benchmark.\nSpecifically, our dataset, called Salient Objects in Clutter (SOC), includes\nimages with both salient and non-salient objects from several common object\ncategories. In addition to object category annotations, each salient image is\naccompanied by attributes that reflect common challenges in real-world scenes,\nwhich can help provide deeper insight into the SOD problem. Further, with a\ngiven saliency encoder, e.g., the backbone network, existing saliency models\nare designed to achieve mapping from the training image set to the training\nground-truth set. We, therefore, argue that improving the dataset can yield\nhigher performance gains than focusing only on the decoder design. With this in\nmind, we investigate several dataset-enhancement strategies, including label\nsmoothing to implicitly emphasize salient boundaries, random image augmentation\nto adapt saliency models to various scenarios, and self-supervised learning as\na regularization strategy to learn from small datasets. Our extensive results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of these tricks. We also provide a comprehensive\nbenchmark for SOD, which can be found in our repository:\nthis http URL",

A knowledge-based\nmodel originally developed for a HT-PEMFC was used to generate simulated data\n(887,735 points) and used to pretrain a neural network source model.\nFurthermore, the source model developed for HT-PEMFCs was successfully applied\nto HT-PEM ECHPs - a different electrochemical system that utilizes similar\nmaterials to the fuel cell. Experimental datasets from both HT-PEMFCs and\nHT-PEM ECHPs with different materials and operating conditions (~50 points\neach) were used to train 8 target models via FSL.

Since label information is often\nexpensive to acquire, multi-view clustering has gained growing interest, which\naims to obtain better clustering solution by exploiting complementary and\nconsistent information across all views rather than only using an individual\nview.

They might significantly deteriorate the performance of convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs), because CNNs are easily overfitted on corrupted labels.\nTo address this issue, inspired by an observation, deep neural networks might\nfirst memorize the probably correct-label data and then corrupt-label samples,\nwe propose a novel yet simple self-paced resistance framework to resist\ncorrupted labels, without using any clean validation data. The proposed\nframework first utilizes the memorization effect of CNNs to learn a curriculum,\nwhich contains confident samples and provides meaningful supervision for other\ntraining samples. Then it adopts selected confident samples and a proposed\nresistance loss to update model parameters; the resistance loss tends to smooth\nmodel parameters' update or attain equivalent prediction over each class,\nthereby resisting model overfitting on corrupted labels.

Since there is not any\nexplicit efficient construction of AG codes over prime fields, we consider\nconstructions over prime fields with the help of concatenation method and those\nover field extensions. Extending the Fourier analysis done by Benhamouda et\nal., concatenated algebraic geometric codes over prime fields do produce some\nnice leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes. One natural and curious question\nis whether AG codes over extension fields produce better leakage-resilient\nsecret sharing schemes than the construction based on concatenated AG codes.\nSuch construction provides several advantages compared to the construction over\nprime fields using concatenation method. First, AG codes over extension fields\ngive secret sharing schemes with smaller reconstruction for a fixed privacy\nparameter t. Second, concatenated AG codes do not enjoy strong multiplicity and\nhence they are not applicable to secure MPC schemes. It is also confirmed that\nindeed AG codes over extension fields have stronger leakage-resilience under\nsome reasonable assumptions. These three advantages strongly motivate the study\nof secret sharing schemes from AG codes over extension fields. The current\npaper has two main contributions: 1, we obtain leakage-resilient secret sharing\nschemes with constant share sizes and unbounded numbers of players. Like Shamir\nsecret scheme, our schemes enjoy multiplicity and hence can be applied to MPC.\n2, via a sophisticated Fourier Analysis, we analyze the leakage-resilience of\nsecret sharing schemes from codes over extension fields.

    "abstract": "Modulating image restoration level aims to generate a restored image by\naltering a factor that represents the restoration strength. Previous works\nmainly focused on optimizing the mean squared reconstruction error, which\nbrings high reconstruction accuracy but lacks finer texture details. This paper\npresents a Controllable Unet Generative Adversarial Network (CUGAN) to generate\nhigh-frequency textures in the modulation tasks. CUGAN consists of two modules\n-- base networks and condition networks. The base networks comprise a generator\nand a discriminator. In the generator, we realize the interactive control of\nrestoration levels by tuning the weights of different features from different\nscales in the Unet architecture. Moreover, we adaptively modulate the\nintermediate features in the discriminator according to the severity of\ndegradations.

During testing, users can control the\noutput effects by tweaking the condition vector. We also provide a smooth\ntransition between GAN and MSE effects by a simple transition method.

One significant problem of HOI detection\nis that non-interactive human-object pair can be easily mis-grouped and\nmisclassified as an action, especially when humans are close and performing\nsimilar actions in the scene. To address the mis-grouping problem, we propose a\nspatial enhancement approach to enforce fine-level spatial constraints in two\ndirections from human body parts to the object center, and from object parts to\nthe human center. At inference, we propose a human-object regrouping approach\nby considering the object-exclusive property of an action, where the target\nobject should not be shared by more than one human. By suppressing\nnon-interactive pairs, our approach can decrease the false positives.\nExperiments on V-COCO and HICO-DET datasets demonstrate our approach is more\nrobust compared to the existing methods under the presence of multiple humans\nand objects in the scene.",

When preference lists are strict, the number of residents\nassigned to each hospital is the same in any stable matching due to the famous\nrural hospitals theorem, so there is no room for algorithmic interventions.\nHowever, when ties are introduced in preference lists, this is not the case\nsince the number of residents may vary over stable matchings. The main focus of\nthis paper is to investigate how much we can utilize this flexibility to aid\nrural hospitals, in the presence of ties.

    "abstract": "In the classic longest common substring (LCS) problem, we are given two\nstrings $S$ and $T$, each of length at most $n$, over an alphabet of size\n$\\sigma$, and we are asked to find a longest string occurring as a fragment of\nboth $S$ and $T$. Weiner, in his seminal paper that introduced the suffix tree,\npresented an $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log \\sigma)$-time algorithm for this problem [SWAT\n1973]. For polynomially-bounded integer alphabets, the linear-time construction\nof suffix trees by Farach yielded an $\\mathcal{O}(n)$-time algorithm for the\nLCS problem [FOCS 1997]. However, for small alphabets, this is not necessarily\noptimal for the LCS problem in the word RAM model of computation, in which the\nstrings can be stored in $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log \\sigma/\\log n )$ space and read in\n$\\mathcal{O}(n \\log \\sigma/\\log n )$ time. We show that, in this model, we can\ncompute an LCS in time $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log \\sigma / \\sqrt{\\log n})$, which is\nsublinear in $n$ if $\\sigma=2^{o(\\sqrt{\\log n})}$ (in particular, if\n$\\sigma=\\mathcal{O}(1)$), using optimal space $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log \\sigma/\\log\nn)$.\nWe then lift our ideas to the problem of computing a $k$-mismatch LCS, which\nhas received considerable attention in recent years. In this problem, the aim\nis to compute a longest substring of $S$ that occurs in $T$ with at most $k$\nmismatches. Thankachan et al.~showed how to compute a $k$-mismatch LCS in\n$\\mathcal{O}(n \\log^k n)$ time for $k=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ [J. Comput.

    "abstract": "Recent high-profile attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) have brought to\nthe forefront the vulnerability of \"smart\" devices, and have resulted in\nnumerous IoT-focused security analyses. Many of the attacks had weak device\nconfiguration as the root cause. One potential source of rich and definitive\ninformation about the configuration of an IoT device is the device's firmware.\nHowever, firmware analysis is complex and automated firmware analyses have thus\nfar been confined to devices with more traditional operating systems such as\nLinux or VxWorks. Most IoT peripherals, due to lacking traditional operating\nsystems and implementing a wide variety of communication technologies, have\nonly been the subject of smaller-scale analyses. Peripheral firmware analysis\nis further complicated by the fact that such firmware files are predominantly\navailable as stripped binaries, without the ELF headers and symbol tables that\nwould simplify reverse engineering.\nIn this paper, we present argXtract, an open-source automated static analysis\ntool, which extracts security-relevant configuration information from stripped\nIoT peripheral firmware. Specifically, we focus on binaries that target the ARM\nCortex-M architecture, due to its growing popularity among IoT peripherals.\nargXtract overcomes the challenges associated with stripped Cortex-M analysis\nand is able to retrieve arguments to security-relevant supervisor and function\ncalls, enabling automated bulk analysis of firmware files. We demonstrate this\nvia three real-world case studies. The largest case study covers a dataset of\n243 Bluetooth Low Energy binaries targeting Nordic Semiconductor chipsets,\nwhile the other two focus on Nordic ANT and STMicroelectronics BlueNRG\nbinaries. The results reveal widespread lack of security and privacy controls\nin IoT, such as minimal or no protection for data, fixed passkeys and trackable\ndevice addresses.",

This leads to a new\nproblem of confidence discrepancy for the detector ensembles. The confidence\nhas little effect on single detectors but significantly affects detector\nensembles. To address this issue, we propose a novel ensemble called the\nProbabilistic Ranking Aware Ensemble (PRAE) that refines the confidence of\nbounding boxes from detectors.

We can then rank the detected bounding boxes\nfor assembly. We also introduce a bandit approach to address the confidence\nimbalance problem caused by the need to deal with different numbers of boxes at\ndifferent confidence levels.

In this paper, inspired by the\ndiffusive ODEs, we propose a novel diffusion residual network (Diff-ResNet) to\nstrengthen the interactions among data points. Under the structured data\nassumption, it is proved that the diffusion mechanism can decrease the\ndistance-diameter ratio that improves the separability of inter-class points\nand reduces the distance among local intra-class points. This property can be\neasily adopted by the residual networks for constructing the separable\nhyperplanes.

    "abstract": "With the wide application of deep neural networks, it is important to verify\na host's possession over a deep neural network model and protect the model. To\nmeet this goal, various mechanisms have been designed. By embedding extra\ninformation into a network and revealing it afterward, the watermark becomes a\ncompetitive candidate in proving integrity for deep learning systems. However,\nconcurrent watermarking schemes can hardly be adopted for emerging distributed\nlearning paradigms that raise extra requirements during the ownership\nverification. A spearheading distributed learning paradigm is federated\nlearning (FL) where many parties participate in training one single model. Each\nauthor participating in the FL should be able to verify its ownership\nindependently. Moreover, there are other potential threat and corresponding\nsecurity requirements under this scenario. To meet those requirements, in this\npaper, we demonstrate a watermarking protocol for protecting deep neural\nnetworks in the setting of FL. By incorporating the state-of-the-art\nwatermarking scheme and the cryptological primitive designed for distributed\nstorage, the protocol meets the need for ownership verification in the FL\nscenario without violating the privacy for each participant.

    "title": "The Shadowy Lives of Emojis: An Analysis of a Hacktivist Collective's  Use of Emojis on Twitter",
    "abstract": "Emojis have established themselves as a popular means of communication in\nonline messaging. Despite the apparent ubiquity in these image-based tokens,\nhowever, interpretation and ambiguity may allow for unique uses of emojis to\nappear. In this paper, we present the first examination of emoji usage by\nhacktivist groups via a study of the Anonymous collective on Twitter. This\nresearch aims to identify whether Anonymous affiliates have evolved their own\napproach to using emojis. To do this, we compare a large dataset of Anonymous\ntweets to a baseline tweet dataset from randomly sampled Twitter users using\ncomputational and qualitative analysis to compare their emoji usage. We utilise\nWord2Vec language models to examine the semantic relationships between emojis,\nidentifying clear distinctions in the emoji-emoji relationships of Anonymous\nusers. We then explore how emojis are used as a means of conveying emotions,\nfinding that despite little commonality in emoji-emoji semantic ties, Anonymous\nemoji usage displays similar patterns of emotional purpose to the emojis of\nbaseline Twitter users. Finally, we explore the textual context in which these\nemojis occur, finding that although similarities exist between the emoji usage\nof our Anonymous and baseline Twitter datasets, Anonymous users appear to have\nadopted more specific interpretations of certain emojis. This includes the use\nof emojis as a means of expressing adoration and infatuation towards notable\nAnonymous affiliates. These findings indicate that emojis appear to retain a\nconsiderable degree of similarity within Anonymous accounts as compared to more\ntypical Twitter users. However, their are signs that emoji usage in Anonymous\naccounts has evolved somewhat, gaining additional group-specific associations\nthat reveal new insights into the behaviours of this unusual collective.",

    "abstract": "Graph data are ubiquitous in the real world. Graph learning (GL) tries to\nmine and analyze graph data so that valuable information can be discovered.\nExisting GL methods are designed for centralized scenarios. However, in\npractical scenarios, graph data are usually distributed in different\norganizations, i.e., the curse of isolated data islands. To address this\nproblem, we incorporate federated learning into GL and propose a general\nFederated Graph Learning framework FedGL, which is capable of obtaining a\nhigh-quality global graph model while protecting data privacy by discovering\nthe global self-supervision information during the federated training.\nConcretely, we propose to upload the prediction results and node embeddings to\nthe server for discovering the global pseudo label and global pseudo graph,\nwhich are distributed to each client to enrich the training labels and\ncomplement the graph structure respectively, thereby improving the quality of\neach local model. Moreover, the global self-supervision enables the information\nof each client to flow and share in a privacy-preserving manner, thus\nalleviating the heterogeneity and utilizing the complementarity of graph data\namong different clients. Finally, experimental results show that FedGL\nsignificantly outperforms baselines on four widely used graph datasets.",

However, as DNN algorithms become more\ncomplex and optimized for specific applications, latency requirements remain\nchallenging, and it is critical to find the optimal points in the design space.\nTo decouple the architectural search from the target hardware, we propose a\ntime estimation framework that allows for modeling the inference latency of\nDNNs on hardware accelerators based on mapping and layer-wise estimation\nmodels. The proposed methodology extracts a set of models from micro-kernel and\nmulti-layer benchmarks and generates a stacked model for mapping and network\nexecution time estimation.

    "abstract": "Graph representation learning has achieved great success in many areas,\nincluding e-commerce, chemistry, biology, etc. However, the fundamental problem\nof choosing the appropriate dimension of node embedding for a given graph still\nremains unsolved. The commonly used strategies for Node Embedding Dimension\nSelection (NEDS) based on grid search or empirical knowledge suffer from heavy\ncomputation and poor model performance. In this paper, we revisit NEDS from the\nperspective of minimum entropy principle. Subsequently, we propose a novel\nMinimum Graph Entropy (MinGE) algorithm for NEDS with graph data. To be\nspecific, MinGE considers both feature entropy and structure entropy on graphs,\nwhich are carefully designed according to the characteristics of the rich\ninformation in them. The feature entropy, which assumes the embeddings of\nadjacent nodes to be more similar, connects node features and link topology on\ngraphs. The structure entropy takes the normalized degree as basic unit to\nfurther measure the higher-order structure of graphs. Based on them, we design\nMinGE to directly calculate the ideal node embedding dimension for any graph.\nFinally, comprehensive experiments with popular Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our\nproposed MinGE.",

Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is the classic\narchitecture to build a feature pyramid with high-level semantics throughout.\nHowever, intrinsic defects in feature extraction and fusion inhibit FPN from\nfurther aggregating more discriminative features. In this work, we propose\nAttention Aggregation based Feature Pyramid Network (A^2-FPN), to improve\nmulti-scale feature learning through attention-guided feature aggregation. In\nfeature extraction, it extracts discriminative features by\ncollecting-distributing multi-level global context features, and mitigates the\nsemantic information loss due to drastically reduced channels. In feature\nfusion, it aggregates complementary information from adjacent features to\ngenerate location-wise reassembly kernels for content-aware sampling, and\nemploys channel-wise reweighting to enhance the semantic consistency before\nelement-wise addition. A^2-FPN shows consistent gains on different instance\nsegmentation frameworks. By replacing FPN with A^2-FPN in Mask R-CNN, our model\nboosts the performance by 2.1% and 1.6% mask AP when using ResNet-50 and\nResNet-101 as backbone, respectively. Moreover, A^2-FPN achieves an improvement\nof 2.0% and 1.4% mask AP when integrated into the strong baselines such as\nCascade Mask R-CNN and Hybrid Task Cascade.",

In\nthis work, we conduct extensive experiments to verify and analyze the uncanny\neffectiveness of learning rate rewinding.

By leveraging the right learning rate schedule in retraining, we\ndemonstrate a counter-intuitive phenomenon in that randomly pruned networks\ncould even achieve better performance than methodically pruned networks\n(fine-tuned with the conventional approach).

    "abstract": "In Function as a Service (FaaS), a serverless computing variant, customers\ndeploy functions instead of complete virtual machines or Linux containers. It\nis the cloud provider who maintains the runtime environment for these\nfunctions. FaaS products are offered by all major cloud providers (e.g. Amazon\nLambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions); as well as standalone\nopen-source software (e.g. Apache OpenWhisk) with their commercial variants\n(e.g. Adobe I/O Runtime or IBM Cloud Functions). We take the bottom-up\nperspective of a single node in a FaaS cluster. We assume that all the\nexecution environments for a set of functions assigned to this node have been\nalready installed. Our goal is to schedule individual invocations of functions,\npassed by a load balancer, to minimize performance metrics related to response\ntime. Deployed functions are usually executed repeatedly in response to\nmultiple invocations made by end-users. Thus, our scheduling decisions are\nbased on the information gathered locally: the recorded call frequencies and\nexecution times. We propose a number of heuristics, and we also adapt some\ntheoretically-grounded ones like SEPT or SERPT. Our simulations use a\nrecently-published Azure Functions Trace. We show that, compared to the\nbaseline FIFO or round-robin, our data-driven scheduling decisions\nsignificantly improve the performance.",

This problem is overcome by ring- and module-based schemes such\nas Ring-LWE or Module-LWE, whose keysize can be reduced by exploiting its\nalgebraic structure, allowing for neater and faster computations. Many rings\nmay be chosen to define such cryptoschemes, but cyclotomic rings, due to their\ncyclic nature allowing for easy multiplication, are the community standard.\nHowever, there is still much uncertainty as to whether this structure may be\nexploited to an adversary's benefit. In this paper, we show that the\ndecomposition group of a cyclotomic ring of arbitrary conductor may be utilised\nin order to significantly decrease the dimension of the ideal (or module)\nlattice required to solve a given instance of SVP. Moreover, we show that there\nexist a large number of rational primes for which, if the prime ideal factors\nof an ideal lie over primes of this form, give rise to an \"easy\" instance of\nSVP. However, it is important to note that this work does not break Ring-LWE or\nModule-LWE, since the security reduction is from worst case ideal or module SVP\nto average case Ring-LWE or Module-LWE respectively, and is one way.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have served as a catalyst in introducing a\nplethora of next-generation services in the era of Internet of Things (IoT),\nthanks to the availability of massive amounts of data collected by the objects\non the edge. Currently, DNN models are used to deliver many Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) services that include image and natural language processing,\nspeech recognition, and robotics. Accordingly, such services utilize various\nDNN models that make it computationally intensive for deployment on the edge\ndevices alone. Thus, most AI models are offloaded to distant cloud data centers\n(CDCs), which tend to consolidate large amounts of computing and storage\nresources into one or more CDCs. Deploying services in the CDC will inevitably\nlead to excessive latencies and overall increase in power consumption. Instead,\nfog computing allows for cloud services to be extended to the edge of the\nnetwork, which allows for data processing to be performed closer to the\nend-user device. However, different from cloud data centers, fog nodes have\nlimited computational power and are highly distributed in the network. In this\npaper, using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), we formulate the\nplacement of DNN inference models, which is abstracted as a network embedding\nproblem in a Cloud Fog Network (CFN) architecture, where power savings are\nintroduced through trade-offs between processing and networking.

Conventional modelling\napproaches had no success in addressing the problem largely because of\nunavailability of peak floods hydraulic data and highly non-linear behaviour of\ndebris at culvert.

From the results, NASNet was reported most efficient in classifying\nthe blockage with the accuracy of 85\\%; however, EfficientNetB3 was recommended\nfor the hardware implementation because of its improved response time with\naccuracy comparable to NASNet (i.e., 83\\%).

    "abstract": "Cross drainage hydraulic structures (i.e., culverts, bridges) in urban\nlandscapes are prone to getting blocked by transported debris which often\nresults in causing the flash floods. In context of Australia, Wollongong City\nCouncil (WCC) blockage conduit policy is the only formal guideline to consider\nblockage in design process. However, many argue that this policy is based on\nthe post floods visual inspections and hence can not be considered accurate\nrepresentation of hydraulic blockage. As a result of this on-going debate,\nvisual blockage and hydraulic blockage are considered two distinct terms with\nno established quantifiable relation among both. This paper attempts to relate\nboth terms by proposing the use of deep visual features for prediction of\nhydraulic blockage at a given culvert. An end-to-end machine learning pipeline\nis propounded which takes an image of culvert as input, extract visual features\nusing deep learning models, pre-process the visual features and feed into\nregression model to predict the corresponding hydraulic blockage. Dataset\n(i.e., Hydrology-Lab Dataset (HD), Visual Hydrology-Lab Dataset (VHD)) used in\nthis research was collected from in-lab experiments carried out using scaled\nphysical models of culverts where multiple blockage scenarios were replicated\nat scale. Performance of regression models was assessed using standard\nevaluation metrics. Furthermore, performance of overall machine learning\npipeline was assessed in terms of processing times for relative comparison of\nmodels and hardware requirement analysis. From the results ANN used with\nMobileNet extracted visual features achieved the best regression performance\nwith $R^{2}$ score of 0.7855. Positive value of $R^{2}$ score indicated the\npresence of correlation between visual features and hydraulic blockage and\nsuggested that both can be interrelated with each other.",

    "abstract": "Text-based image captioning (TextCap) which aims to read and reason images\nwith texts is crucial for a machine to understand a detailed and complex scene\nenvironment, considering that texts are omnipresent in daily life. This task,\nhowever, is very challenging because an image often contains complex texts and\nvisual information that is hard to be described comprehensively. Existing\nmethods attempt to extend the traditional image captioning methods to solve\nthis task, which focus on describing the overall scene of images by one global\ncaption. This is infeasible because the complex text and visual information\ncannot be described well within one caption. To resolve this difficulty, we\nseek to generate multiple captions that accurately describe different parts of\nan image in detail. To achieve this purpose, there are three key challenges: 1)\nit is hard to decide which parts of the texts of images to copy or paraphrase;\n2) it is non-trivial to capture the complex relationship between diverse texts\nin an image; 3) how to generate multiple captions with diverse content is still\nan open problem. To conquer these, we propose a novel Anchor-Captioner method.\nSpecifically, we first find the important tokens which are supposed to be paid\nmore attention to and consider them as anchors. Then, for each chosen anchor,\nwe group its relevant texts to construct the corresponding anchor-centred graph\n(ACG). Last, based on different ACGs, we conduct multi-view caption generation\nto improve the content diversity of generated captions.

To support this task, we build an\narticulated model repository ReArt-48 and present an efficient dataset\ngeneration pipeline, which contains Fast Articulated Object Modeling (FAOM) and\nSemi-Authentic MixEd Reality Technique (SAMERT). Accompanying the pipeline, we\nbuild a large-scale mixed reality dataset ReArtMix and a real world dataset\nReArtVal. We also propose an effective framework ReArtNOCS that exploits RGB-D\ninput to estimate part-level pose for multiple instances in a single forward\npass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ReArtNOCS can achieve\ngood performance on both CAPER and CAPE settings. We believe it could serve as\na strong baseline for future research on the CAPER task.",

The coronavirus outbreak of December 2019 has already infected\nmillions all over the world and continues to spread on. Just when the curve of\nthe outbreak had started to flatten, many countries have again started to\nwitness a rise in cases which is now being referred as the 2nd wave of the\npandemic. A thorough analysis of time-series forecasting models is therefore\nrequired to equip state authorities and health officials with immediate\nstrategies for future times. This aims of the study are three-fold: (a) To\nmodel the overall trend of the spread; (b) To generate a short-term forecast of\n10 days in countries with the highest incidence of confirmed cases (USA, India\nand Brazil); (c) To quantitatively determine the algorithm that is best suited\nfor precise modelling of the linear and non-linear features of the time series.\nThe comparison of forecasting models for the total cumulative cases of each\ncountry is carried out by comparing the reported data and the predicted value,\nand then ranking the algorithms (Prophet, Holt-Winters, LSTM, ARIMA, and\nARIMA-NARNN) based on their RMSE, MAE and MAPE values. The hybrid combination\nof ARIMA and NARNN (Nonlinear Auto-Regression Neural Network) gave the best\nresult among the selected models with a reduced RMSE, which proved to be almost\n35.3% better than one of the most prevalent method of time-series prediction\n(ARIMA).

It was noticed that the number\n$k$ of steps is typically small compared to the number of users in the\nreal-world instances of WSP; therefore $k$ is considered as the parameter in\nWSP parametrised complexity research. While WSP in general was shown to be\nW[1]-hard, WSP restricted to a special case of user-independent (UI)\nconstraints is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT).

In this\nwork, an effective architecture,multi-size neural network with attention\nmechanism (AM-MSNN),is introduced into the answer selection task.

However, FL demands\npowerful computational resources from the clients. Therefore, not all the\nclients can participate in training if they do not have enough computational\nresources. To address this issue, we introduce a more practical approach called\nhybrid federated and centralized learning (HFCL), wherein only the clients with\nsufficient resources employ FL, while the remaining ones send their datasets to\nthe PS, which computes the model on behalf of them. Then, the model parameters\ncorresponding to all clients are aggregated at the PS. To improve the\nefficiency of dataset transmission, we propose two different techniques:\nincreased computation-per-client and sequential data transmission.

Moreover, the mainstream\nsolutions for this task are still statistical-based and solely focus on\ntime-series data modeling, which limit the forecast accuracy. Towards\ninsightful fashion trend forecasting, previous work [1] proposed to analyze\nmore fine-grained fashion elements which can informatively reveal fashion\ntrends. Specifically, it focused on detailed fashion element trend forecasting\nfor specific user groups based on social media data. In addition, it proposed a\nneural network-based method, namely KERN, to address the problem of fashion\ntrend modeling and forecasting. In this work, to extend the previous work, we\npropose an improved model named Relation Enhanced Attention Recurrent (REAR)\nnetwork.

Our aim\nis to minimize the long-term time-averaged expected precoding deviation over\nMIMO fading channels, subject to both per-cell long-term and short-term\ntransmit power limits. We propose an online coordinated precoding algorithm for\nvirtualization, which provides a fully distributed semi-closed-form precoding\nsolution at each cell, based only on the current imperfect CSI without any CSI\nexchange across cells. Taking into account the two-fold impact of imperfect CSI\non both the InP and the SPs, we show that our proposed algorithm is within an\n$O(\\delta)$ gap from the optimum over any time horizon, where $\\delta$ is a CSI\ninaccuracy indicator. Simulation results validate the performance of our\nproposed algorithm under two commonly used precoding techniques in a typical\nurban micro-cell network environment.",

In this paper, we\nutilize the latent context recurrent encoders motivated by recent Meta-RL\nmaterials, and propose the Latent Context-based Soft Actor Critic (LC-SAC)\nmethod to address aforementioned issues. By minimizing the contrastive\nprediction loss function, the learned context variables capture the information\nof the environment dynamics and the recent behavior of the agent.

In this short article, we study various\napproaches to task specific NER. Task specific NER has two components -\nidentifying the intent of a piece of text (like search queries), and then\nlabeling the query with task specific named entities. For example, we consider\nthe task of labeling Target store locations in a search query (which could be\nentered in a search box or spoken in a device like Alexa or Google Home). Store\nlocations are highly ambiguous and sometimes it is difficult to differentiate\nbetween say a location and a non-location. For example, \"pickup my order at\norange store\" has \"orange\" as the store location, while \"buy orange at target\"\nhas \"orange\" as a fruit. We explore this difficulty by doing multi-task\nlearning which we call global to local transfer of information. We jointly\nlearn the query intent (i.e. store lookup) and the named entities by using\nmultiple loss functions in our BERT based model and find interesting results.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is an emerging topic and will soon be able to perform\ndecisions better than humans. In more complex and creative contexts such as\ninnovation, however, the question remains whether machines are superior to\nhumans. Machines fail in two kinds of situations: processing and interpreting\nsoft information (information that cannot be quantified) and making predictions\nin unknowable risk situations of extreme uncertainty. In such situations, the\nmachine does not have representative information for a certain outcome.\nThereby, humans are still the gold standard for assessing soft signals and make\nuse of intuition. To predict the success of startups, we, thus, combine the\ncomplementary capabilities of humans and machines in a Hybrid Intelligence\nmethod. To reach our aim, we follow a design science research approach to\ndevelop a Hybrid Intelligence method that combines the strength of both machine\nand collective intelligence to demonstrate its utility for predictions under\nextreme uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Focusing on comprehensive networking, big data, and artificial intelligence,\nthe Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) facilitates efficiency and robustness\nin factory operations. Various sensors and field devices play a central role,\nas they generate a vast amount of real-time data that can provide insights into\nmanufacturing. The synergy of complex event processing (CEP) and machine\nlearning (ML) has been developed actively in the last years in IIoT to identify\npatterns in heterogeneous data streams and fuse raw data into tangible facts.\nIn a traditional compute-centric paradigm, the raw field data are continuously\nsent to the cloud and processed centrally. As IIoT devices become increasingly\npervasive and ubiquitous, concerns are raised since transmitting such amount of\ndata is energy-intensive, vulnerable to be intercepted, and subjected to high\nlatency. The data-centric paradigm can essentially solve these problems by\nempowering IIoT to perform decentralized on-device ML and CEP, keeping data\nprimarily on edge devices and minimizing communications. However, this is no\nmean feat because most IIoT edge devices are designed to be computationally\nconstrained with low power consumption. This paper proposes a framework that\nexploits ML and CEP's synergy at the edge in distributed sensor networks. By\nleveraging tiny ML and micro CEP, we shift the computation from the cloud to\nthe power-constrained IIoT devices and allow users to adapt the on-device ML\nmodel and the CEP reasoning logic flexibly on the fly without requiring to\nreupload the whole program. Lastly, we evaluate the proposed solution and show\nits effectiveness and feasibility using an industrial use case of machine\nsafety monitoring.",

A time-triggered hypervisor that activates\nvirtual CPUs according to a global schedule can provide the means to allow for\na resource efficient implementation of the time-triggered paradigm in\nvirtualized distributed real-time systems. A prerequisite of time-triggered\nvirtualization for hard real-time systems is providing access to a global time\nbase to VMs as well as to the hypervisor. A global time base is the result of\nclock synchronization with an upper bound on the clock synchronization\nprecision.\nWe present a formalization of the notion of time in virtualized real-time\nsystems. We use this formalization to propose a virtual clock condition that\nenables us to test the suitability of a virtual clock for the design of\nvirtualized time-triggered real-time systems. We discuss and model how\nvirtualization, in particular resource consolidation versus resource\npartitioning, degrades clock synchronization precision. Finally, we apply our\ninsights to model the IEEE~802.1AS clock synchronization protocol and derive an\nupper bound on the clock synchronization precision of IEEE 802.1AS.

Closed-form expressions for the gradient of general neural networks\nwith respect to their inputs are derived.

Owing to the noisy nature of the channel, it may be\noverly restrictive to attempt to detect all deviations. In our formulation, we\nonly require detecting deviations which impede the decoding of the\nnon-deviating user's message. When neither user deviates, correct decoding is\nrequired. When one user deviates, the decoder must either output a pair of\nmessages of which the message of the non-deviating user is correct or identify\nthe deviating user. The users and the receiver do not share any randomness. The\nresults include a characterization of the set of channels where communication\nis feasible, and an inner and outer bound on the capacity region.",

The regularized problem is then approximated by a\nfully discrete scheme. Our theoretical results include: estimate of the error\norder between the discrete problem and the continuous direct problem; the\nconvergence rate of the discrete regularized solution to the target source\nterm; and the convergence of the regularized solution with respect to the noise\nlevel. Then we propose an accelerated primal-dual iterative algorithm based on\nan equivalent saddle-point reformulation of the discrete regularized model.\nFinally, a series of numerical tests are carried out to demonstrate the\nefficiency and accuracy of the algorithm.",

These points are either the points that need to be\nconnected by non-intersecting paths or special `reference' points that\nparametrize the topology of the original environment prior to the\ntransformation. When all the necessary points on the circle are fully\nconnected, the transformation is reversed such that the line segments combine\nto become the non-intersecting paths that connect the start and end points in\nthe original environment.

At the same time, many conventional approaches in\nnetwork science efficiently utilize the hierarchical approaches to account for\nthe hierarchical organization of the networks, and recent works emphasize their\ncritical importance. This paper aims to connect the dots between the\ntraditional Neural Network and the Graph Neural Network architectures as well\nas the network science approaches, harnessing the power of the hierarchical\nnetwork organization. A Hierarchical Graph Neural Network architecture is\nproposed, supplementing the original input network layer with the hierarchy of\nauxiliary network layers and organizing the computational scheme updating the\nnode features through both - horizontal network connections within each layer\nas well as the vertical connection between the layers. It enables simultaneous\nlearning of the individual node features along with the aggregated network\nfeatures at variable resolution and uses them to improve the convergence and\nstability of the individual node feature learning.

    "abstract": "Constrained optimization solvers with Integer Linear programming (ILP) have\nbeen the cornerstone for explainable natural language inference during its\ninception. ILP based approaches provide a way to encode explicit and\ncontrollable assumptions casting natural language inference as an abductive\nreasoning problem, where the solver constructs a plausible explanation for a\ngiven hypothesis. While constrained based solvers provide explanations, they\nare often limited by the use of explicit constraints and cannot be integrated\nas part of broader deep neural architectures. In contrast, state-of-the-art\ntransformer-based models can learn from data and implicitly encode complex\nconstraints. However, these models are intrinsically black boxes. This paper\npresents a novel framework named $\\partial$-Explainer (Diff-Explainer) that\ncombines the best of both worlds by casting the constrained optimization as\npart of a deep neural network via differentiable convex optimization and\nfine-tuning pre-trained transformers for downstream explainable NLP tasks. To\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the framework, we transform the constraints\npresented by TupleILP and integrate them with sentence embedding transformers\nfor the task of explainable science QA. Our experiments show up to $\\approx\n10\\%$ improvement over non-differentiable solver while still providing\nexplanations for supporting its inference.",

    "abstract": "Economic model predictive control (EMPC) is a promising methodology for\noptimal operation of dynamical processes that has been shown to improve process\neconomics considerably. However, EMPC performance relies heavily on the\naccuracy of the process model used. As an alternative to model-based control\nstrategies, reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated as a model-free\ncontrol methodology, but issues regarding its safety and stability remain an\nopen research challenge. This work presents a novel framework for integrating\nEMPC and RL for online model parameter estimation of a class of nonlinear\nsystems. In this framework, EMPC optimally operates the closed loop system\nwhile maintaining closed loop stability and recursive feasibility. At the same\ntime, to optimize the process, the RL agent continuously compares the measured\nstate of the process with the model's predictions (nominal states), and\nmodifies model parameters accordingly. The major advantage of this framework is\nits simplicity; state-of-the-art RL algorithms and EMPC schemes can be employed\nwith minimal modifications. The performance of the proposed framework is\nillustrated on a network of reactions with challenging dynamics and practical\nsignificance. This framework allows control, optimization, and model correction\nto be performed online and continuously, making autonomous reactor operation\nmore attainable.",

Understanding the mechanisms driving these patterns would inform\nefforts to diversify the academy and shed new light on the role of hiring in\nshaping which scientific discoveries are made. Here, we investigate the degree\nto which structural mechanisms can explain hierarchy and other network\ncharacteristics observed in empirical faculty hiring networks. We study a\nfamily of adaptive rewiring network models, which reinforce institutional\nprestige within the hierarchy in five distinct ways. Each mechanism determines\nthe probability that a new hire comes from a particular institution according\nto that institution's prestige score, which is inferred from the hiring\nnetwork's existing structure. We find that structural inequalities and\ncentrality patterns in real hiring networks are best reproduced by a mechanism\nof global placement power, in which a new hire is drawn from a particular\ninstitution in proportion to the number of previously drawn hires anywhere. On\nthe other hand, network measures of biased visibility are better recapitulated\nby a mechanism of local placement power, in which a new hire is drawn from a\nparticular institution in proportion to the number of its previous hires\nalready present at the hiring institution. These contrasting results suggest\nthat the underlying structural mechanism reinforcing hierarchies in faculty\nhiring networks is a mixture of global and local preference for institutional\nprestige. Under these dynamics, we show that each institution's position in the\nhierarchy is remarkably stable, due to a dynamic competition that\noverwhelmingly favors more prestigious institutions.",

As a result, various design methods each with a\nspecific purpose have been developed based on the intuition of human experts.\nIn this work, we propose an artificial intelligence-powered RF pulse design\nframework, DeepRF, which utilizes the self-learning characteristics of deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) to generate a novel RF beyond human intuition.\nAdditionally, the method can design various types of RF pulses via customized\nreward functions. The algorithm of DeepRF consists of two modules: the RF\ngeneration module, which utilizes DRL to explore new RF pulses, and the RF\nrefinement module, which optimizes the seed RF pulses from the generation\nmodule via gradient ascent. The effectiveness of DeepRF is demonstrated using\nfour exemplary RF pulses, slice-selective excitation pulse, slice-selective\ninversion pulse, B1-insensitive volume inversion pulse, and B1-insensitive\nselective inversion pulse, that are commonly used in MRI. The results show that\nthe DeepRF-designed pulses successfully satisfy the design criteria while\nimproving specific absorption rates when compared to those of the conventional\nRF pulses. Further analyses suggest that the DeepRF-designed pulses utilize new\nmechanisms of magnetization manipulation that are difficult to be explained by\nconventional theory, suggesting the potentials of DeepRF in discovering unseen\ndesign dimensions beyond human intuition.

    "abstract": "The early diagnosis and screening of glaucoma are important for patients to\nreceive treatment in time and maintain eyesight. Nowadays, deep learning (DL)\nbased models have been successfully used for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of\nglaucoma from retina fundus images. However, a DL model pre-trained using a\ndataset from one hospital center may have poor performance on a dataset from\nanother new hospital center and therefore its applications in the real scene\nare limited. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive transfer learning (SATL)\nstrategy to fill the domain gap between multicenter datasets. Specifically, the\nencoder of a DL model that is pre-trained on the source domain is used to\ninitialize the encoder of a reconstruction model. Then, the reconstruction\nmodel is trained using only unlabeled image data from the target domain, which\nmakes the encoder in the model adapt itself to extract useful high-level\nfeatures both for target domain images encoding and glaucoma classification,\nsimultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SATL\nstrategy is effective in the domain adaptation task between a private and two\npublic glaucoma diagnosis datasets, i.e. pri-RFG, REFUGE, and LAG. Moreover,\nthe proposed strategy is completely independent of the source domain data,\nwhich meets the real scene application and the privacy protection policy.",

These advantages have been recognised in the\nregulatory arena, especially for environmental risk assessment (ERA) of\npesticides, where time-varying exposure is the norm. We critically evaluate the\nlink between the modelled variables in TKTD models and the observations from\nlaboratory ecotoxicity tests. For the endpoint reproduction, this link is far\nfrom trivial. The relevant TKTD models for sub-lethal effects are based on\nDynamic-Energy Budget (DEB) theory, which specifies a continuous investment\nflux into reproduction. In contrast, experimental tests score egg or offspring\nrelease by the mother. The link between model and data is particularly\ntroublesome when a species reproduces in discrete clutches, and even more so\nwhen eggs are incubated in the mother's brood pouch (and release of neonates is\nscored in the test). This situation is quite common among aquatic invertebrates\n(e.g., cladocerans, amphipods, mysids), including many popular test species. We\ndiscuss these and other issues with reproduction data, reflect on their\npotential impact on DEB-TKTD analysis, and provide preliminary recommendations\nto correct them. Both modellers and users of model results need to be aware of\nthese complications, as ignoring them could easily lead to unnecessary failure\nof DEB-TKTD models during calibration, or when validating them against\nindependent data for other exposure scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: The activity of the adaptive immune system is governed by T-cells\nand their specific T-cell receptors (TCR), which selectively recognize foreign\nantigens. Recent advances in experimental techniques have enabled sequencing of\nTCRs and their antigenic targets (epitopes), allowing to research the missing\nlink between TCR sequence and epitope binding specificity. Scarcity of data and\na large sequence space make this task challenging, and to date only models\nlimited to a small set of epitopes have achieved good performance. Here, we\nestablish a k-nearest-neighbor (K-NN) classifier as a strong baseline and then\npropose TITAN (Tcr epITope bimodal Attention Networks), a bimodal neural\nnetwork that explicitly encodes both TCR sequences and epitopes to enable the\nindependent study of generalization capabilities to unseen TCRs and/or\nepitopes. Results: By encoding epitopes at the atomic level with SMILES\nsequences, we leverage transfer learning and data augmentation to enrich the\ninput data space and boost performance. TITAN achieves high performance in the\nprediction of specificity of unseen TCRs (ROC-AUC 0.87 in 10-fold CV) and\nsurpasses the results of the current state-of-the-art (ImRex) by a large\nmargin. Notably, our Levenshtein-distance-based K-NN classifier also exhibits\ncompetitive performance on unseen TCRs. While the generalization to unseen\nepitopes remains challenging, we report two major breakthroughs. First, by\ndissecting the attention heatmaps, we demonstrate that the sparsity of\navailable epitope data favors an implicit treatment of epitopes as classes.\nThis may be a general problem that limits unseen epitope performance for\nsufficiently complex models. Second, we show that TITAN nevertheless exhibits\nsignificantly improved performance on unseen epitopes and is capable of\nfocusing attention on chemically meaningful molecular structures.",

    "title": "Meta-validation of bipartite network projections",
    "abstract": "Monopartite projections of bipartite networks are key tools to model indirect\ninteractions in complex systems. The standard approach to extract informative\npatterns from these systems is to statistically validate them using a suitable\nnull network model. A popular choice of null model is the configuration model\n(CM), built by constraining the degrees of the network and randomizing\neverything else. However different CM formulations exist, depending on how the\ndegree constraints are imposed and for which nodes of the bipartite network.\nHere we systematically investigate the application of the various CM\nformulations in filtering the same network, showing that they lead to\nremarkably different results even when the same statistical threshold is\nadopted. Rather, more similar results are obtained for the same density of\nstatistically significant links. In particular, we show that a common community\nstructure may emerge in a specific range of density values. Finally, we develop\na meta-validation approach, which allows to identify model-specific statistical\nthresholds for which the signal is strongest, and at the same time to obtain\nresults independent of the way in which the null hypothesis is formulated.",

    "abstract": "We have built a computational model for individual aging trajectories of\nhealth and survival, which contains physical, functional, and biological\nvariables, and is conditioned on demographic, lifestyle, and medical background\ninformation. We combine techniques of modern machine learning with an\ninterpretable interaction network, where health variables are coupled by\nexplicit pair-wise interactions within a stochastic dynamical system. Our model\nis scalable to large longitudinal data sets, is predictive of individual\nhigh-dimensional health trajectories and survival from baseline health states,\nand infers an interpretable network of directed interactions between the health\nvariables. The network identifies plausible physiological connections between\nhealth variables and clusters of strongly connected heath variables. We use\nEnglish Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) data to train our model and show\nthat it performs better than dedicated linear models for health outcomes and\nsurvival. Our model can also be used to generate synthetic individuals that age\nrealistically, to impute missing data, and to simulate future aging outcomes\ngiven arbitrary initial health states.",

    "abstract": "We present a study of kernel MMD two-sample test statistics in the manifold\nsetting, assuming the high-dimensional observations are close to a\nlow-dimensional manifold. We characterize the property of the test (level and\npower) in relation to the kernel bandwidth, the number of samples, and the\nintrinsic dimensionality of the manifold. Specifically, we show that when data\ndensities are supported on a $d$-dimensional sub-manifold $\\mathcal{M}$\nembedded in an $m$-dimensional space, the kernel MMD two-sample test for data\nsampled from a pair of distributions $(p, q)$ that are H\\\"older with order\n$\\beta$ is consistent and powerful when the number of samples $n$ is greater\nthan $\\delta_2(p,q)^{-2-d/\\beta}$ up to certain constant, where $\\delta_2$ is\nthe squared $\\ell_2$-divergence between two distributions on manifold.\nMoreover, to achieve testing consistency under this scaling of $n$, our theory\nsuggests that the kernel bandwidth $\\gamma$ scales with $n^{-1/(d+2\\beta)}$.\nThese results indicate that the kernel MMD two-sample test does not have a\ncurse-of-dimensionality when the data lie on the low-dimensional manifold. We\ndemonstrate the validity of our theory and the property of the MMD test for\nmanifold data using several numerical experiments.",
