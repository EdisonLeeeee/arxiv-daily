    "abstract": "The presence and complexity of political Twitter bots has increased in recent\nyears, making it a very difficult task to recognize these accounts from real,\nhuman users. We intended to provide an answer to the following question: are\ntemporal patterns of activity qualitatively different in fake and human\naccounts? We collected a large sample of tweets during the post-electoral\nconflict in the US in 2020 and performed supervised and non-supervised\nstatistical learning technique sto quantify the predictive power of time-series\nfeatures for human-bot recognition. Our results show that there are no\nsubstantial differences, suggesting that political bots are nowadays very\ncapable of mimicking human behaviour. This finding reveals the need for novel,\nmore sophisticated bot-detection techniques.",

    "abstract": "Scholars have recently drawn attention to a range of controversial issues\nposed by the use of computer vision for automatically generating descriptions\nof people in images. Despite these concerns, automated image description has\nbecome an important tool to ensure equitable access to information for blind\nand low vision people. In this paper, we investigate the ethical dilemmas faced\nby companies that have adopted the use of computer vision for producing alt\ntext: textual descriptions of images for blind and low vision people, We use\nFacebook's automatic alt text tool as our primary case study. First, we analyze\nthe policies that Facebook has adopted with respect to identity categories,\nsuch as race, gender, age, etc., and the company's decisions about whether to\npresent these terms in alt text. We then describe an alternative -- and manual\n-- approach practiced in the museum community, focusing on how museums\ndetermine what to include in alt text descriptions of cultural artifacts. We\ncompare these policies, using notable points of contrast to develop an analytic\nframework that characterizes the particular apprehensions behind these policy\nchoices. We conclude by considering two strategies that seem to sidestep some\nof these concerns, finding that there are no easy ways to avoid the normative\ndilemmas posed by the use of computer vision to automate alt text.",

Meanwhile, research on\ncollecting high quality annotations suggests using a qualification that\nrequires workers to have previously completed a certain number of tasks. If\nmost requesters who pay fairly require workers to have completed a large number\nof tasks already then workers need to complete a substantial amount of poorly\npaid work before they can earn a fair wage. Through analysis of worker\ndiscussions and guidance for researchers, we estimate that workers spend\napproximately 2.25 months of full time effort on poorly paid tasks in order to\nget the qualifications needed for better paid tasks. We discuss alternatives to\nthis qualification and conduct a study of the correlation between\nqualifications and work quality on two NLP tasks.

    "abstract": "Electric Vehicles are increasingly common, with inductive chargepads being\nconsidered a convenient and efficient means of charging electric vehicles.\nHowever, drivers are typically poor at aligning the vehicle to the necessary\naccuracy for efficient inductive charging, making the automated alignment of\nthe two charging plates desirable. In parallel to the electrification of the\nvehicular fleet, automated parking systems that make use of surround-view\ncamera systems are becoming increasingly popular. In this work, we propose a\nsystem based on the surround-view camera architecture to detect, localize and\nautomatically align the vehicle with the inductive chargepad. The visual design\nof the chargepads is not standardized and not necessarily known beforehand.\nTherefore a system that relies on offline training will fail in some\nsituations. Thus we propose an online learning method that leverages the\ndriver's actions when manually aligning the vehicle with the chargepad and\ncombine it with weak supervision from semantic segmentation and depth to learn\na classifier to auto-annotate the chargepad in the video for further training.\nIn this way, when faced with a previously unseen chargepad, the driver needs\nonly manually align the vehicle a single time. As the chargepad is flat on the\nground, it is not easy to detect it from a distance. Thus, we propose using a\nVisual SLAM pipeline to learn landmarks relative to the chargepad to enable\nalignment from a greater range. We demonstrate the working system on an\nautomated vehicle as illustrated in the video https://youtu.be/_cLCmkW4UYo. To\nencourage further research, we will share a chargepad dataset used in this\nwork.",

    "abstract": "Rapid growth in scientific data and a widening gap between computational\nspeed and I/O bandwidth makes it increasingly infeasible to store and share all\ndata produced by scientific simulations. Instead, we need methods for reducing\ndata volumes: ideally, methods that can scale data volumes adaptively so as to\nenable negotiation of performance and fidelity tradeoffs in different\nsituations. Multigrid-based hierarchical data representations hold promise as a\nsolution to this problem, allowing for flexible conversion between different\nfidelities so that, for example, data can be created at high fidelity and then\ntransferred or stored at lower fidelity via logically simple and mathematically\nsound operations. However, the effective use of such representations has been\nhindered until now by the relatively high costs of creating, accessing,\nreducing, and otherwise operating on such representations. We describe here\nhighly optimized data refactoring kernels for GPU accelerators that enable\nefficient creation and manipulation of data in multigrid-based hierarchical\nforms. We demonstrate that our optimized design can achieve up to 264 TB/s\naggregated data refactoring throughput -- 92% of theoretical peak -- on 1024\nnodes of the Summit supercomputer.

    "abstract": "Accurate reconstruction of static environments from LiDAR scans of scenes\ncontaining dynamic objects, which we refer to as Dynamic to Static Translation\n(DST), is an important area of research in Autonomous Navigation. This problem\nhas been recently explored for visual SLAM, but to the best of our knowledge no\nwork has been attempted to address DST for LiDAR scans. The problem is of\ncritical importance due to wide-spread adoption of LiDAR in Autonomous\nVehicles. We show that state-of the art methods developed for the visual domain\nwhen adapted for LiDAR scans perform poorly.\nWe develop DSLR, a deep generative model which learns a mapping between\ndynamic scan to its static counterpart through an adversarially trained\nautoencoder. Our model yields the first solution for DST on LiDAR that\ngenerates static scans without using explicit segmentation labels. DSLR cannot\nalways be applied to real world data due to lack of paired dynamic-static\nscans. Using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, we propose DSLR-UDA for transfer\nto real world data and experimentally show that this performs well in real\nworld settings. Additionally, if segmentation information is available, we\nextend DSLR to DSLR-Seg to further improve the reconstruction quality.\nDSLR gives the state of the art performance on simulated and real-world\ndatasets and also shows at least 4x improvement. We show that DSLR, unlike the\nexisting baselines, is a practically viable model with its reconstruction\nquality within the tolerable limits for tasks pertaining to autonomous\nnavigation like SLAM in dynamic environments.",

A puzzling phenomenon in deep learning is that models are trained\nwith many more parameters than what this classical theory would suggest. We\npropose a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. We prove that for a\nbroad class of data distributions and model classes, overparametrization is\nnecessary if one wants to interpolate the data smoothly. Namely we show that\nsmooth interpolation requires $d$ times more parameters than mere\ninterpolation, where $d$ is the ambient data dimension. We prove this universal\nlaw of robustness for any smoothly parametrized function class with polynomial\nsize weights, and any covariate distribution verifying isoperimetry.

While this is common for 2D\nimage classification tasks, its application to 3D medical imaging tasks like\nchest CT interpretation is limited. We explore the idea of whether pretraining\na model on realistic videos could improve performance rather than training the\nmodel from scratch, intended for tuberculosis type classification from chest CT\nscans. To incorporate both spatial and temporal features, we develop a hybrid\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) model,\nwhere the features are extracted from each axial slice of the CT scan by a CNN,\nthese sequence of image features are input to a RNN for classification of the\nCT scan. Our model termed as ViPTT-Net, was trained on over 1300 video clips\nwith labels of human activities, and then fine-tuned on chest CT scans with\nlabels of tuberculosis type. We find that pretraining the model on videos lead\nto better representations and significantly improved model validation\nperformance from a kappa score of 0.17 to 0.35, especially for\nunder-represented class samples.

Related time-series research as outlier and\nnovelty detection or time-series classification does not apply to the concept\nof an anomaly in this field, because they are not single points which have not\nbeen seen previously and may not be precisely annotated. Moreover, due to the\nlack of annotated anomalous data, many benchmarks are adapted from supervised\nscenarios.\nTo address these issues, we generalise the concept of positive and negative\ninstances to intervals to be able to evaluate unsupervised anomaly detection\nalgorithms. We also preserve the imbalance scheme for evaluation through the\nproposal of the Preceding Window ROC, a generalisation for the calculation of\nROC curves for time-series scenarios. We also adapt the mechanism from a\nestablished time-series anomaly detection benchmark to the proposed\ngeneralisations to reward early detection.

The integration of NOMA in the widely adopted orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based VLC networks would require an\noptimal resource allocation for the pair or the cluster of users sharing the\nsame subcarrier(s). In this paper, the max-min rate of a multi-cell indoor\ncentralized VLC network is maximized through optimizing user pairing,\nsubcarrier allocation, and power allocation.

At first, the user pairing\nis assumed to follow the divide-and-next-largest-difference user-pairing\nalgorithm (D-NLUPA) that can ensure fairness among the different clusters.\nThen, subcarrier allocation and power allocation are solved iteratively through\nboth the Simulated Annealing (SA) meta-heuristic algorithm and the bisection\nmethod.

Object detection is\nused in many applications such as industrial process, medical imaging analysis,\nand autonomous vehicles. The ability to detect objects in videos is crucial.\nObject detection systems are trained on large image datasets. For applications\nsuch as autonomous vehicles, it is crucial that the object detection system can\nidentify objects through multiple frames in video. There are many problems with\napplying these systems to video. Shadows or changes in brightness that can\ncause the system to incorrectly identify objects frame to frame and cause an\nunintended system response. There are many neural networks that have been used\nfor object detection and if there was a way of connecting objects between\nframes then these problems could be eliminated. For these neural networks to\nget better at identifying objects in video, they need to be re-trained. A\ndataset must be created with images that represent consecutive video frames and\nhave matching ground-truth layers. A method is proposed that can generate these\ndatasets. The ground-truth layer contains only moving objects. To generate this\nlayer, FlowNet2-Pytorch was used to create the flow mask using the novel\nMagnitude Method. As well, a segmentation mask will be generated using networks\nsuch as Mask R-CNN or Refinenet. These segmentation masks will contain all\nobjects detected in a frame. By comparing this segmentation mask to the flow\nmask ground-truth layer, a loss function is generated. This loss function can\nbe used to train a neural network to be better at making consistent predictions\non video. The system was tested on multiple video samples and a loss was\ngenerated for each frame, proving the Magnitude Method's ability to be used to\ntrain object detection neural networks in future work.",

Using physics models can be inaccurate because they cannot account\nfor unknown factors and the effects of the deformation of the object as it is\nlaunched; moreover, deriving force coefficients for these models is not\npossible without extensive experimental testing. Recently, advancements in\ndata-powered artificial intelligence methods have allowed learnable models and\nsystems to emerge.

    "title": "Sense-Bandits: AI-based Adaptation of Sensing Thresholds for  Heterogeneous-technology Coexistence Over Unlicensed Bands",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present Sense-Bandits, an AI-based framework for\ndistributed adaptation of the sensing thresholds (STs) over shared spectrum.\nThis framework specifically targets the coexistence of heterogenous\ntechnologies, e.g., Wi-Fi, 4G Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA), and 5G New Radio\nUnlicensed (NR-U), over unlicensed channels. To access the channel, a device\ncompares the measured power with a predefined ST value and accordingly decides\nif the channel is idle or not. Improper setting of the ST values creates\nasymmetric sensing floors, resulting in collisions due to hidden terminals\nand/or reduction in the spatial reuse due to exposed terminals. Optimal ST\nsetting is challenging because it requires global knowledge of mobility,\ntraffic loads, and channel access behavior of all contending devices. Sense-\nBandits tackles this problem by employing a clustering-based multi-armed bandit\n(MAB) algorithm, which adapts its learning behavior based on network dynamics.\nClustering allows the algorithm to track network changes in real-time, ensuring\nfast learning of the best ST values by classifying the state and dynamics of\ncoexisting networks. We develop a C++-based network simulator that implements\nSense-Bandits and we apply it to evaluate the coexistence of Wi-Fi and 5G NR-U\nsystems over the unlicensed 5 GHz U NII bands. Our simulation results indicate\nthat ST-adaptive devices employing Sense-Bandits do not harm neighboring\ndevices that adopt a fixed ST value.",

    "abstract": "Neuroevolutionary algorithms, automatic searches of neural network structures\nby means of evolutionary techniques, are computationally costly procedures. In\nspite of this, due to the great performance provided by the architectures which\nare found, these methods are widely applied. The final outcome of\nneuroevolutionary processes is the best structure found during the search, and\nthe rest of the procedure is commonly omitted in the literature. However, a\ngood amount of residual information consisting of valuable knowledge that can\nbe extracted is also produced during these searches. In this paper, we propose\nan approach that extracts this information from neuroevolutionary runs, and use\nit to build a metamodel that could positively impact future neural architecture\nsearches. More specifically, by inspecting the best structures found during\nneuroevolutionary searches of generative adversarial networks with varying\ncharacteristics (e.g., based on dense or convolutional layers), we propose a\nBayesian network-based model which can be used to either find strong neural\nstructures right away, conveniently initialize different structural searches\nfor different problems, or help future optimization of structures of any type\nto keep finding increasingly better structures where uninformed methods get\nstuck into local optima.",

    "abstract": "Considering ubiquitous connectivity and advanced information processing\ncapability, huge amount of low-power IoT devices are deployed nowadays and the\nmaintenance of those devices which includes firmware/software updates and\nrecharging the units has become a bottleneck for IoT systems. For addressing\nlimited battery constraints, wireless power transfer is a promising approach\nsuch that it does not require any physical link between energy harvester and\npower transfer. Furthermore, combining wireless power transfer with information\ntransmission has become more appealing. In the systems that apply radio signals\nthe wireless power transfer has become a popular trend to harvest RF-radiated\nenergy from received information signal in IoT devices. For those systems,\ndesign frameworks mainly deal with the trade-off between information capacity\nand energy harvesting efficiency. Therein various signaling design frameworks\nhave been proposed for different system preferences between power and\ninformation. In addition to this, protecting the information part from\npotential eavesdropping activity in a service area introduces security\nconsiderations for those systems. In this paper, we propose a novel concept,\nInformation Harvesting, for wireless power transfer systems. It introduces a\nnovel protocol design from opposite perspective compared to the existing\nstudies.

    "abstract": "Processing-using-DRAM has been proposed for a limited set of basic operations\n(i.e., logic operations, addition). However, in order to enable full adoption\nof processing-using-DRAM, it is necessary to provide support for more complex\noperations. In this paper, we propose SIMDRAM, a flexible general-purpose\nprocessing-using-DRAM framework that (1) enables the efficient implementation\nof complex operations, and (2) provides a flexible mechanism to support the\nimplementation of arbitrary user-defined operations. The SIMDRAM framework\ncomprises three key steps. The first step builds an efficient MAJ/NOT\nrepresentation of a given desired operation. The second step allocates DRAM\nrows that are reserved for computation to the operation's input and output\noperands, and generates the required sequence of DRAM commands to perform the\nMAJ/NOT implementation of the desired operation in DRAM. The third step uses\nthe SIMDRAM control unit located inside the memory controller to manage the\ncomputation of the operation from start to end, by executing the DRAM commands\ngenerated in the second step of the framework. We design the hardware and ISA\nsupport for SIMDRAM framework to (1) address key system integration challenges,\nand (2) allow programmers to employ new SIMDRAM operations without hardware\nchanges.\nWe evaluate SIMDRAM for reliability, area overhead, throughput, and energy\nefficiency using a wide range of operations and seven real-world applications\nto demonstrate SIMDRAM's generality. Using 16 DRAM banks, SIMDRAM provides (1)\n88x and 5.8x the throughput, and 257x and 31x the energy efficiency, of a CPU\nand a high-end GPU, respectively, over 16 operations; (2) 21x and 2.1x the\nperformance of the CPU and GPU, over seven real-world applications.

First, verifier developers must contend with the\nrapidly changing DNN field to support new DNN operations and property types.\nSecond, verifier users have the burden of selecting a verifier input format to\nspecify their problem. Due to the many input formats, this decision can greatly\nrestrict the verifiers that a user may run. Finally, researchers face\ndifficulties in re-using benchmarks to evaluate and compare verifiers, due to\nthe large number of input formats required to run different verifiers.

    "abstract": "The scientific image integrity area presents a challenging research\nbottleneck, the lack of available datasets to design and evaluate forensic\ntechniques. Its data sensitivity creates a legal hurdle that prevents one to\nrely on real tampered cases to build any sort of accessible forensic benchmark.\nTo mitigate this bottleneck, we present an extendable open-source library that\nreproduces the most common image forgery operations reported by the research\nintegrity community: duplication, retouching, and cleaning. Using this library\nand realistic scientific images, we create a large scientific forgery image\nbenchmark (39,423 images) with an enriched ground-truth. In addition, concerned\nabout the high number of retracted papers due to image duplication, this work\nevaluates the state-of-the-art copy-move detection methods in the proposed\ndataset, using a new metric that asserts consistent match detection between the\nsource and the copied region.

    "abstract": "Recommender Systems are a subclass of machine learning systems that employ\nsophisticated information filtering strategies to reduce the search time and\nsuggest the most relevant items to any particular user. Hybrid recommender\nsystems combine multiple recommendation strategies in different ways to benefit\nfrom their complementary advantages. Some hybrid recommender systems have\ncombined collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to build systems\nthat are more robust. In this paper, we propose a hybrid recommender system,\nwhich combines Alternative Least Squares (ALS) based collaborative filtering\nwith deep learning to enhance recommendation performance as well as overcome\nthe limitations associated with the collaborative filtering approach,\nespecially concerning its cold start problem. In essence, we use the outputs\nfrom ALS (collaborative filtering) to influence the recommendations from a Deep\nNeural Network (DNN), which combines characteristic, contextual, structural and\nsequential information, in a big data processing framework. We have conducted\nseveral experiments in testing the efficacy of the proposed hybrid architecture\nin recommending smartphones to prospective customers and compared its\nperformance with other open-source recommenders.

In this paper, we first present an\nopen-source Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) reliability analysis framework, MAVFI,\nto characterize transient fault's impacts on the end-to-end flight metrics,\ne.g., flight time, success rate. Based on our framework, it is observed that\nthe end-to-end fault tolerance analysis is essential for characterizing system\nreliability. We demonstrate the planning and control stages are more vulnerable\nto transient faults than the visual perception stage in the common\n\"Perception-Planning-Control (PPC)\" compute pipeline. Furthermore, to improve\nthe reliability of the MAV system, we propose two low overhead anomaly-based\ntransient fault detection and recovery schemes based on Gaussian statistical\nmodels and autoencoder neural networks. We validate our anomaly fault\nprotection schemes with a variety of simulated photo-realistic environments on\nboth Intel i9 CPU and ARM Cortex-A57 on Nvidia TX2 platform. It is demonstrated\nthat the autoencoder-based scheme can improve the system reliability by 100%\nrecovering failure cases with less than 0.0062% computational overhead in\nbest-case scenarios.

Although DPDP plays an important role\nin modern logistics and supply chain management, state-of-the-art DPDP\nalgorithms are still limited on their solution quality and efficiency. In\npractice, they fail to provide a scalable solution as the numbers of vehicles\nand sites become large. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach,\nSpatial-Temporal Aided Double Deep Graph Network (ST-DDGN), to solve\nindustry-scale DPDP. In our method, the delivery demands are first forecast\nusing spatial-temporal prediction method, which guides the neural network to\nperceive spatial-temporal distribution of delivery demand when dispatching\nvehicles. Besides, the relationships of individuals such as vehicles are\nmodelled by establishing a graph-based value function. ST-DDGN incorporates\nattention-based graph embedding with Double DQN (DDQN). As such, it can make\nthe inference across vehicles more efficiently compared with traditional\nmethods. Our method is entirely data driven and thus adaptive, i.e., the\nrelational representation of adjacent vehicles can be learned and corrected by\nST-DDGN from data periodically. We have conducted extensive experiments over\nreal-world data to evaluate our solution. The results show that ST-DDGN reduces\n11.27% number of the used vehicles and decreases 13.12% total transportation\ncost on average over the strong baselines, including the heuristic algorithm\ndeployed in our UAT (User Acceptance Test) environment and a variety of vanilla\nDRL methods.

Neither\nclassical machine learning models nor deep neural networks trained end-to-end\non EEG are typically designed or tested for robustness to corruption, and\nespecially to randomly missing channels. While some studies have proposed\nstrategies for using data with missing channels, these approaches are not\npractical when sparse montages are used and computing power is limited (e.g.,\nwearables, cell phones). To tackle this problem, we propose dynamic spatial\nfiltering (DSF), a multi-head attention module that can be plugged in before\nthe first layer of a neural network to handle missing EEG channels by learning\nto focus on good channels and to ignore bad ones. We tested DSF on public EEG\ndata encompassing ~4,000 recordings with simulated channel corruption and on a\nprivate dataset of ~100 at-home recordings of mobile EEG with natural\ncorruption. Our proposed approach achieves the same performance as baseline\nmodels when no noise is applied, but outperforms baselines by as much as 29.4%\naccuracy when significant channel corruption is present.

    "abstract": "The spiking neural network (SNN) computes and communicates information\nthrough discrete binary events. It is considered more biologically plausible\nand more energy-efficient than artificial neural networks (ANN) in emerging\nneuromorphic hardware. However, due to the discontinuous and non-differentiable\ncharacteristics, training SNN is a relatively challenging task. Recent work has\nachieved essential progress on an excellent performance by converting ANN to\nSNN. Due to the difference in information processing, the converted deep SNN\nusually suffers serious performance loss and large time delay. In this paper,\nwe analyze the reasons for the performance loss and propose a novel bistable\nspiking neural network (BSNN) that addresses the problem of spikes of\ninactivated neurons (SIN) caused by the phase lead and phase lag. Also, when\nResNet structure-based ANNs are converted, the information of output neurons is\nincomplete due to the rapid transmission of the shortcut path. We design\nsynchronous neurons (SN) to help efficiently improve performance. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed method only needs 1/4-1/10 of the time steps\ncompared to previous work to achieve nearly lossless conversion. We demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art ANN-SNN conversion for VGG16, ResNet20, and ResNet34 on\nchallenging datasets including CIFAR-10 (95.16% top-1), CIFAR-100 (78.12%\ntop-1), and ImageNet (72.64% top-1).",

    "abstract": "In the online innovation market, the fund-raising performance of the start-up\nproject is a concerning issue for creators, investors and platforms.\nUnfortunately, existing studies always focus on modeling the fund-raising\nprocess after the publishment of a project but the predicting of a project\nattraction in the market before setting up is largely unexploited. Usually,\nthis prediction is always with great challenges to making a comprehensive\nunderstanding of both the start-up project and market environment. To that end,\nin this paper, we present a focused study on this important problem from a\nmarket graph perspective. Specifically, we propose a Graph-based Market\nEnvironment (GME) model for predicting the fund-raising performance of the\nunpublished project by exploiting the market environment. In addition, we\ndiscriminatively model the project competitiveness and market preferences by\ndesigning two graph-based neural network architectures and incorporating them\ninto a joint optimization stage. Furthermore, to explore the information\npropagation problem with dynamic environment in a large-scale market graph, we\nextend the GME model with parallelizing competitiveness quantification and\nhierarchical propagation algorithm. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments\non real-world data. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed model.",

To\nconstruct contrastive samples with unlabeled images, two sampling strategies\nthat exploit structure similarity across medical images and utilize\npseudo-labels for construction, termed region-aware and anatomical-aware\ncontrastive sampling, are investigated.

While SSDs offer high-performance I/O, the\nreliability challenges faced by the HPC applications under the SSD-related\nfailures remains unclear, in particular for failures resulting in data\ncorruptions. The goal of this paper is to understand the impact of SSD-related\nfaults on the behaviors of complex HPC applications.

FFIS is able to plant different I/O related faults into the data returned\nfrom underlying file systems, which enables the investigation on the error\nresilience characteristics of the scientific file format. We demonstrate the\nuse of FFIS with three representative real HPC applications, showing how each\napplication reacts to the data corruptions, and provide insights on the error\nresilience of the widely adopted HDF5 file format for the HPC applications.",

The main idea of this approach\nis that the owner of service composition leverages the security policy model\n(SPM) to define the access control relationships that service composition must\ncomply with in the application plane, then SPM model is transformed into the\nlow-level security policy model (RSPM) containing the information of SDN data\nplane, and RSPM model is uploaded into the SDN controller. After uploading, the\nvirtual machine access control algorithm integrated in the SDN controller\nmonitors all of access requests towards service composition at runtime. Only\nthe access requests that meet the definition of RSPM model can be forwarded to\nthe target terminal. Any access requests that do not meet the definition of\nRSPM model will be automatically blocked by Openflow switches or deleted by SDN\ncontroller, Thus, this approach can effectively solve the problems of\nnetwork-layer illegal accesses, identity theft attacks and service leakages\nwhen Web service composition is running. In order to verify the feasibility of\nthis approach, this paper implements an experimental system by using POX\ncontroller and Mininet virtual network simulator, and evaluates the\neffectiveness and performance of this approach by using this system.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in unsupervised domain adaptation have seen considerable\nprogress in semantic segmentation. Existing methods either align different\ndomains with adversarial training or involve the self-learning that utilizes\npseudo labels to conduct supervised training. The former always suffers from\nthe unstable training caused by adversarial training and only focuses on the\ninter-domain gap that ignores intra-domain knowledge. The latter tends to put\noverconfident label prediction on wrong categories, which propagates errors to\nmore samples. To solve these problems, we propose a two-stage adaptive semantic\nsegmentation method based on the local Lipschitz constraint that satisfies both\ndomain alignment and domain-specific exploration under a unified principle. In\nthe first stage, we propose the local Lipschitzness regularization as the\nobjective function to align different domains by exploiting intra-domain\nknowledge, which explores a promising direction for non-adversarial adaptive\nsemantic segmentation. In the second stage, we use the local Lipschitzness\nregularization to estimate the probability of satisfying Lipschitzness for each\npixel, and then dynamically sets the threshold of pseudo labels to conduct\nself-learning. Such dynamical self-learning effectively avoids the error\npropagation caused by noisy labels. Optimization in both stages is based on the\nsame principle, i.e., the local Lipschitz constraint, so that the knowledge\nlearned in the first stage can be maintained in the second stage. Further, due\nto the model-agnostic property, our method can easily adapt to any CNN-based\nsemantic segmentation networks.

    "title": "Better Regularization for Sequential Decision Spaces: Fast Convergence  Rates for Nash, Correlated, and Team Equilibria",
    "abstract": "We study the application of iterative first-order methods to the problem of\ncomputing equilibria of large-scale two-player extensive-form games.\nFirst-order methods must typically be instantiated with a regularizer that\nserves as a distance-generating function for the decision sets of the players.\nFor the case of two-player zero-sum games, the state-of-the-art theoretical\nconvergence rate for Nash equilibrium is achieved by using the dilated entropy\nfunction. In this paper, we introduce a new entropy-based distance-generating\nfunction for two-player zero-sum games, and show that this function achieves\nsignificantly better strong convexity properties than the dilated entropy,\nwhile maintaining the same easily-implemented closed-form proximal mapping.\nExtensive numerical simulations show that these superior theoretical properties\ntranslate into better numerical performance as well.\nWe then generalize our new entropy distance function, as well as general\ndilated distance functions, to the scaled extension operator. The scaled\nextension operator is a way to recursively construct convex sets, which\ngeneralizes the decision polytope of extensive-form games, as well as the\nconvex polytopes corresponding to correlated and team equilibria. By\ninstantiating first-order methods with our regularizers, we develop the first\naccelerated first-order methods for computing correlated equilibra and ex-ante\ncoordinated team equilibria. Our methods have a guaranteed $1/T$ rate of\nconvergence, along with linear-time proximal updates.",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful indirect\ngenotype-to-phenotype mapping for evolutionary search, but they have\nlimitations. In particular, GAN output does not scale to arbitrary dimensions,\nand there is no obvious way to combine GAN outputs into a cohesive whole, which\nwould be useful in many areas, such as video game level generation. Game levels\noften consist of several segments, sometimes repeated directly or with\nvariation, organized into an engaging pattern. Such patterns can be produced\nwith Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPNs). Specifically, a CPPN can\ndefine latent vector GAN inputs as a function of geometry, which provides a way\nto organize level segments output by a GAN into a complete level. However, a\ncollection of latent vectors can also be evolved directly, to produce more\nchaotic levels. Here, we propose a new hybrid approach that evolves CPPNs\nfirst, but allows the latent vectors to evolve later, and combines the benefits\nof both approaches. These approaches are evaluated in Super Mario Bros. and The\nLegend of Zelda. We previously demonstrated via divergent search (MAP-Elites)\nthat CPPNs better cover the space of possible levels than directly evolved\nlevels. Here, we show that the hybrid approach can cover areas that neither of\nthe other methods can and achieves comparable or superior QD scores.",

    "abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models achieve state-of-the-art performance\non many translation benchmarks. As an active research field in NMT, knowledge\ndistillation is widely applied to enhance the model's performance by\ntransferring teacher model's knowledge on each training sample. However,\nprevious work rarely discusses the different impacts and connections among\nthese samples, which serve as the medium for transferring teacher knowledge. In\nthis paper, we design a novel protocol that can effectively analyze the\ndifferent impacts of samples by comparing various samples' partitions. Based on\nabove protocol, we conduct extensive experiments and find that the teacher's\nknowledge is not the more, the better. Knowledge over specific samples may even\nhurt the whole performance of knowledge distillation. Finally, to address these\nissues, we propose two simple yet effective strategies, i.e., batch-level and\nglobal-level selections, to pick suitable samples for distillation. We evaluate\nour approaches on two large-scale machine translation tasks, WMT'14\nEnglish->German and WMT'19 Chinese->English.

Instead of naively pipelining these techniques, our Joint-DetNAS\noptimizes them jointly. The algorithm consists of two core processes: student\nmorphism optimizes the student's architecture and removes the redundant\nparameters, while dynamic distillation aims to find the optimal matching\nteacher. For student morphism, weight inheritance strategy is adopted, allowing\nthe student to flexibly update its architecture while fully utilize the\npredecessor's weights, which considerably accelerates the search; To facilitate\ndynamic distillation, an elastic teacher pool is trained via integrated\nprogressive shrinking strategy, from which teacher detectors can be sampled\nwithout additional cost in subsequent searches. Given a base detector as the\ninput, our algorithm directly outputs the derived student detector with high\nperformance without additional training. Experiments demonstrate that our\nJoint-DetNAS outperforms the naive pipelining approach by a great margin. Given\na classic R101-FPN as the base detector, Joint-DetNAS is able to boost its mAP\nfrom 41.4 to 43.9 on MS COCO and reduce the latency by 47%, which is on par\nwith the SOTA EfficientDet while requiring less search cost.

    "abstract": "Logit dynamics is a form of randomized game dynamics where players have a\nbias towards strategic deviations that give a higher improvement in cost. It is\nused extensively in practice. In congestion (or potential) games, the dynamics\nconverges to the so-called Gibbs distribution over the set of all strategy\nprofiles, when interpreted as a Markov chain. In general, logit dynamics might\nconverge slowly to the Gibbs distribution, but beyond that, not much is known\nabout their algorithmic aspects, nor that of the Gibbs distribution. In this\nwork, we are interested in the following two questions for congestion games: i)\nIs there an efficient algorithm for sampling from the Gibbs distribution? ii)\nIf yes, do there also exist natural randomized dynamics that converges quickly\nto the Gibbs distribution?\nWe first study these questions in extension parallel congestion games, a\nwell-studied special case of symmetric network congestion games. As our main\nresult, we show that there is a simple variation on the logit dynamics (in\nwhich we in addition are allowed to randomly interchange the strategies of two\nplayers) that converges quickly to the Gibbs distribution in such games. This\nanswers both questions above affirmatively. We also address the first question\nfor the class of so-called capacitated $k$-uniform congestion games.\nTo prove our results, we rely on the recent breakthrough work of Anari, Liu,\nOveis-Gharan and Vinzant (2019) concerning the approximate sampling of the base\nof a matroid according to strongly log-concave probability distribution.",

Unlike convolutions which\nare inherently parallel, the de-facto standard for NMS, namely GreedyNMS,\ncannot be easily parallelized and thus could be the performance bottleneck in\nconvolutional object detection pipelines. MaxpoolNMS is introduced as a\nparallelizable alternative to GreedyNMS, which in turn enables faster speed\nthan GreedyNMS at comparable accuracy. However, MaxpoolNMS is only capable of\nreplacing the GreedyNMS at the first stage of two-stage detectors like\nFaster-RCNN. There is a significant drop in accuracy when applying MaxpoolNMS\nat the final detection stage, due to the fact that MaxpoolNMS fails to\napproximate GreedyNMS precisely in terms of bounding box selection. In this\npaper, we propose a general, parallelizable and configurable approach\nPSRR-MaxpoolNMS, to completely replace GreedyNMS at all stages in all\ndetectors. By introducing a simple Relationship Recovery module and a Pyramid\nShifted MaxpoolNMS module, our PSRR-MaxpoolNMS is able to approximate GreedyNMS\nmore precisely than MaxpoolNMS.

Although RL originally aims to\nmaximize return indirectly through optimization of policy, the recent work by\nLevine has proposed a different derivation process with explicit consideration\nof optimality as stochastic variable. This paper follows this concept and\nformulates the traditional learning laws for both value function and policy as\nthe optimization problems with reverse KL divergence including optimality.\nFocusing on the asymmetry of KL divergence, the new optimization problems with\nforward KL divergence are derived. Remarkably, such new optimization problems\ncan be regarded as optimistic RL. That optimism is intuitively specified by a\nhyperparameter converted from an uncertainty parameter. In addition, it can be\nenhanced when it is integrated with prioritized experience replay and\neligibility traces, both of which accelerate learning.

    "title": "Estimating Instance-dependent Label-noise Transition Matrix using DNNs",
    "abstract": "In label-noise learning, estimating the transition matrix is a hot topic as\nthe matrix plays an important role in building statistically consistent\nclassifiers. Traditionally, the transition from clean distribution to noisy\ndistribution (i.e., clean label transition matrix) has been widely exploited to\nlearn a clean label classifier by employing the noisy data. Motivated by that\nclassifiers mostly output Bayes optimal labels for prediction, in this paper,\nwe study to directly model the transition from Bayes optimal distribution to\nnoisy distribution (i.e., Bayes label transition matrix) and learn a Bayes\noptimal label classifier. Note that given only noisy data, it is ill-posed to\nestimate either the clean label transition matrix or the Bayes label transition\nmatrix. But favorably, Bayes optimal labels are less uncertain compared with\nthe clean labels, i.e., the class posteriors of Bayes optimal labels are\none-hot vectors while those of clean labels are not. This enables two\nadvantages to estimate the Bayes label transition matrix, i.e., (a) we could\ntheoretically recover a set of Bayes optimal labels under mild conditions; (b)\nthe feasible solution space is much smaller. By exploiting the advantages, we\nestimate the Bayes label transition matrix by employing a deep neural network\nin a parameterized way, leading to better generalization and superior\nclassification performance.",

    "abstract": "InfoNCE loss is a widely used loss function for contrastive model training.\nIt aims to estimate the mutual information between a pair of variables by\ndiscriminating between each positive pair and its associated $K$ negative\npairs. It is proved that when the sample labels are clean, the lower bound of\nmutual information estimation is tighter when more negative samples are\nincorporated, which usually yields better model performance. However, in many\nreal-world tasks the labels often contain noise, and incorporating too many\nnoisy negative samples for model training may be suboptimal. In this paper, we\nstudy how many negative samples are optimal for InfoNCE in different scenarios\nvia a semi-quantitative theoretical framework. More specifically, we first\npropose a probabilistic model to analyze the influence of the negative sampling\nratio $K$ on training sample informativeness. Then, we design a training\neffectiveness function to measure the overall influence of training samples on\nmodel learning based on their informativeness. We estimate the optimal negative\nsampling ratio using the $K$ value that maximizes the training effectiveness\nfunction. Based on our framework, we further propose an adaptive negative\nsampling method that can dynamically adjust the negative sampling ratio to\nimprove InfoNCE based model training. Extensive experiments on different\nreal-world datasets show our framework can accurately predict the optimal\nnegative sampling ratio in different tasks, and our proposed adaptive negative\nsampling method can achieve better performance than the commonly used fixed\nnegative sampling ratio strategy.",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) transmit information through discrete spikes,\nwhich performs well in processing spatial-temporal information. Due to the\nnon-differentiable characteristic, there still exist difficulties in designing\nwell-performed SNNs. Recently, SNNs trained with backpropagation have shown\nsuperior performance due to the proposal of the gradient approximation.\nHowever, the performance on complex tasks is still far away from the deep\nneural networks. Taking inspiration from the autapse in the brain which\nconnects the spiking neurons with a self-feedback connection, we apply an\nadaptive time-delayed self-feedback on the membrane potential to regulate the\nspike precisions.

With the\ncombination of the two mechanisms, we propose a deep spiking neural network\nwith adaptive self-feedback and balanced excitatory and inhibitory neurons\n(BackEISNN).

    "abstract": "In this work, we aim to address the 3D scene stylization problem - generating\nstylized images of the scene at arbitrary novel view angles. A straightforward\nsolution is to combine existing novel view synthesis and image/video style\ntransfer approaches, which often leads to blurry results or inconsistent\nappearance. Inspired by the high quality results of the neural radiance fields\n(NeRF) method, we propose a joint framework to directly render novel views with\nthe desired style. Our framework consists of two components: an implicit\nrepresentation of the 3D scene with the neural radiance field model, and a\nhypernetwork to transfer the style information into the scene representation.\nIn particular, our implicit representation model disentangles the scene into\nthe geometry and appearance branches, and the hypernetwork learns to predict\nthe parameters of the appearance branch from the reference style image. To\nalleviate the training difficulties and memory burden, we propose a two-stage\ntraining procedure and a patch sub-sampling approach to optimize the style and\ncontent losses with the neural radiance field model. After optimization, our\nmodel is able to render consistent novel views at arbitrary view angles with\narbitrary style. Both quantitative evaluation and human subject study have\ndemonstrated that the proposed method generates faithful stylization results\nwith consistent appearance across different views.",

Therefore, it is\nimperative to understand how the QAnon theory became a worldwide phenomenon and\nhow this dissemination has been happening in the online space. This paper\nperforms a large-scale data analysis of QAnon through Telegram by collecting\n4.5M messages posted in 161 QAnon groups/channels. Using Google's Perspective\nAPI, we analyze the toxicity of QAnon content across languages and over time.\nAlso, using a BERT-based topic modeling approach, we analyze the QAnon\ndiscourse across multiple languages. Among other things, we find that the\nGerman language is prevalent in QAnon groups/channels on Telegram, even\novershadowing English after 2020. Also, we find that content posted in German\nand Portuguese tends to be more toxic compared to English. Our topic modeling\nindicates that QAnon supporters discuss various topics of interest within\nfar-right movements, including world politics, conspiracy theories, COVID-19,\nand the anti-vaccination movement.

    "abstract": "In the information economy, individuals' work performance is closely\nassociated with their digital communication strategies. This study combines\nsocial network and semantic analysis to develop a method to identify top\nperformers based on email communication. By reviewing existing literature, we\nidentified the indicators that quantify email communication into measurable\ndimensions. To empirically examine the predictive power of the proposed\nindicators, we collected 2 million email archive of 578 executives in an\ninternational service company. Panel regression was employed to derive\ninterpretable association between email indicators and top performance. The\nresults suggest that top performers tend to assume central network positions\nand have high responsiveness to emails. In email contents, top performers use\nmore positive and complex language, with low emotionality, but rich in\ninfluential words that are probably reused by co-workers. To better explore the\npredictive power of the email indicators, we employed AdaBoost machine learning\nmodels, which achieved 83.56% accuracy in identifying top performers. With\ncluster analysis, we further find three categories of top performers,\n\"networkers\" with central network positions, \"influencers\" with influential\nideas and \"positivists\" with positive sentiments. The findings suggest that top\nperformers have distinctive email communication patterns, laying the foundation\nfor grounding email communication competence in theory.

    "abstract": "Among fundamental problems in the context of distributed computing by\nautonomous mobile entities, one of the most representative and well studied is\n{\\sc Point Convergence}: given an arbitrary initial configuration of identical\nentities, disposed in the Euclidean plane, move in such a way that, for all\n$\\eps>0$, a configuration in which the separation between all entities is at\nmost $\\eps$ is eventually reached and maintained.\nThe problem has been previously studied in a variety of settings, including\nfull visibility, exact measurements (like distances and angles), and\nsynchronous activation of entities. Our study concerns the minimal assumptions\nunder which entities, moving asynchronously with limited and unknown visibility\nrange and subject to limited imprecision in measurements, can be guaranteed to\nconverge in this way.\nWe present an algorithm that solves {\\sc Point Convergence}, for entities in\nthe plane, in such a setting, provided the degree of asynchrony is bounded:\nwhile any one entity is active, any other entity can be activated at most $k$\ntimes, for some arbitrarily large but fixed $k$. This provides a strong\npositive answer to a decade old open question posed by Katreniak.\nWe also prove that in a comparable setting that permits unbounded asynchrony,\n{\\sc Point Convergence} in the plane is impossible, contingent on the natural\nassumption that algorithms maintain the (visible) connectivity among entities\npresent in the initial configuration. This variant, that we call {\\sc Cohesive\nConvergence}, serves to distinguish the power of bounded and unbounded\nasynchrony in the control of autonomous mobile entities, settling at the same\ntime a long-standing question whether in the Euclidean plane synchronously\nscheduled entities are more powerful than asynchronously scheduled entities.",

To address this issue, in this paper,\nwe propose a dynamic leader-follower approach to solving the line marching\nproblem for a swarm of planar kinematic robots. In contrast to the existing\nresults, the desired positions for the robots in the line are not fully\nlabel-specified, but determined in a dynamic way according to the current state\nof the robot swarm. By constantly forming a chain of leader-follower pairs,\nexact formation can be achieved by pairwise leader-following tracking. Since\nthe order of the chain of leader-follower pairs is constantly updated, the\nproposed algorithm shows strong robustness against robot failures.\nComprehensive numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the\nproposed algorithm.",

MedKGC can find new facts based on the\nexited knowledge in the KGs. The path-based knowledge reasoning algorithm is\none of the most important approaches to this task. This type of method has\nreceived great attention in recent years because of its high performance and\ninterpretability. In fact, traditional methods such as path ranking algorithm\n(PRA) take the paths between an entity pair as atomic features. However, the\nmedical KGs are very sparse, which makes it difficult to model effective\nsemantic representation for extremely sparse path features. The sparsity in the\nmedical KGs is mainly reflected in the long-tailed distribution of entities and\npaths. Previous methods merely consider the context structure in the paths of\nthe knowledge graph and ignore the textual semantics of the symbols in the\npath. Therefore, their performance cannot be further improved due to the two\naspects of entity sparseness and path sparseness. To address the above issues,\nthis paper proposes two novel path-based reasoning methods to solve the\nsparsity issues of entity and path respectively, which adopts the textual\nsemantic information of entities and paths for MedKGC.

Although random sampling with phone-level prosody\ndistribution has been investigated to generate different prosody patterns, the\ndiversity of the generated speech is still very limited and far from what can\nbe achieved by human.

By combining niching or clustering strategy, the state-of-the-art\napproaches generally divide the population into several subpopulations to find\nmultiple solutions for a problem at hand. However, these methods only guided by\nthe fitness value during iterations, which are suffering from determining the\nnumber of subpopulations, i.e., the number of niche areas or clusters. To\ncompensate for this drawback, this paper presents an Attention-oriented Brain\nStorm Optimization (ABSO) method that introduces the attention mechanism into a\nrelatively new swarm intelligence algorithm, i.e., Brain Storm Optimization\n(BSO). By converting the objective space from the fitness space into\n\"attention\" space, the individuals are clustered and updated iteratively\naccording to their salient values. Rather than converge to a single global\noptimum, the proposed method can guide the search procedure to converge to\nmultiple \"salient\" solutions. The preliminary results show that the proposed\nmethod can locate multiple global and local optimal solutions of several\nmultimodal benchmark functions. The proposed method needs less prior knowledge\nof the problem and can automatically converge to multiple optimums guided by\nthe attention mechanism, which has excellent potential for further development.",

    "abstract": "Lattices have been conceived as a powerful tool for data hiding. While\nconventional studies and applications focus on achieving the optimal robustness\nversus distortion tradeoff, in some applications such as data hiding in\nmedical/physiological signals, the primary concern is to achieve a minimum\namount of distortion to the cover signal. In this paper, we revisit the\ncelebrated quantization index modulation (QIM) scheme and propose a\nminimum-distortion version of it, referred to as MD-QIM. The crux of MD-QIM is\nto move the data point to only the boundary of the Voronoi region of the\nlattice point indexed by a message, which suffices for subsequent correct\ndecoding. At any fixed code rate, the scheme achieves the minimum amount of\ndistortion by sacrificing the robustness to the additive white Gaussian noise\n(AWGN) attacks. Simulation results confirm that our scheme significantly\noutperforms QIM in terms of mean square error (MSE), peak signal to noise ratio\n(PSNR) and percentage residual difference (PRD).",

    "abstract": "Swarm intelligence optimization algorithms can be adopted in swarm robotics\nfor target searching tasks in a 2-D or 3-D space by treating the target signal\nstrength as fitness values. Many current works in the literature have achieved\ngood performance in single-target search problems. However, when there are\nmultiple targets in an environment to be searched, many swarm\nintelligence-based methods may converge to specific locations prematurely,\nmaking it impossible to explore the environment further. The Brain Storm\nOptimization (BSO) algorithm imitates a group of humans in solving problems\ncollectively. A series of guided searches can finally obtain a relatively\noptimal solution for particular optimization problems. Furthermore, with a\nsuitable clustering operation, it has better multi-modal optimization\nperformance, i.e., it can find multiple optima in the objective space. By\nmatching the members in a robotic swarm to the individuals in the algorithm\nunder both environments and robots constraints, this paper proposes a BSO-based\ncollaborative searching framework for swarm robotics called Robotic BSO. The\nsimulation results show that the proposed method can simulate the BSO's guided\nsearch characteristics and has an excellent prospect for multi-target searching\nproblems for swarm robotics.",

This problem can be modeled as a tracking control\nproblem, in which individuals in the swarm follow a target position with the\nconsideration of specific relative distance or orientations. To keep the\ncommunication cost low, the PID controller can be utilized to achieve the\nleader-follower tracking control task without the information of leader\nvelocities.

For\nexample, two different applications might use very different JSON\nrepresentations, or two PDF-writing applications might make use of very\ndifferent areas of the PDF specification to realize the same rendered content.\nThe complexity arising from these distinct origins can lead to large,\ndifficult-to-understand attack surfaces, presenting a security concern when\nconsidering both exfiltration and data schizophrenia. Grammar inference can aid\nin describing the practical language generator behind examples of a data\nformat. However, most grammar inference research focuses on natural language,\nnot data formats, and fails to support crucial features such as type recursion.\nWe propose a novel set of mechanisms for grammar inference, RL-GRIT, and apply\nthem to understanding de facto data formats. After reviewing existing grammar\ninference solutions, it was determined that a new, more flexible scaffold could\nbe found in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Within this work, we lay out the many\nalgorithmic changes required to adapt RL from its traditional, sequential-time\nenvironment to the highly interdependent environment of parsing. The result is\nan algorithm which can demonstrably learn recursive control structures in\nsimple data formats, and can extract meaningful structure from fragments of the\nPDF format.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous data are commonly adopted as the inputs for some models that\npredict the future trends of some observations. Existing predictive models\ntypically ignore the inconsistencies and imperfections in heterogeneous data\nwhile also failing to consider the (1) spatial correlations among monitoring\npoints or (2) predictions for the entire study area. To address the above\nproblems, this paper proposes a deep learning method for fusing heterogeneous\ndata collected from multiple monitoring points using graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCNs) to predict the future trends of some observations and evaluates\nits effectiveness by applying it in an air quality predictions scenario. The\nessential idea behind the proposed method is to (1) fuse the collected\nheterogeneous data based on the locations of the monitoring points with regard\nto their spatial correlations and (2) perform prediction based on global\ninformation rather than local information. In the proposed method, first, we\nassemble a fusion matrix using the proposed RBF-based fusion approach; second,\nbased on the fused data, we construct spatially and temporally correlated data\nas inputs for the predictive model; finally, we employ the spatiotemporal graph\nconvolutional network (STGCN) to predict the future trends of some\nobservations.

The true ingenuity of such an infrastructure lies in providing\nthe commuters with real-time information about citywide transports like public\nbuses, allowing her to pre-plan the travel. However, providing prior\ninformation for transportation systems like public buses in real-time is\ninherently challenging because of the diverse nature of different\nstay-locations that a public bus stops. Although straightforward factors stay\nduration, extracted from unimodal sources like GPS, at these locations look\nerratic, a thorough analysis of public bus GPS trails for 720km of bus travels\nat the city of Durgapur, a semi-urban city in India, reveals that several other\nfine-grained contextual features can characterize these locations accurately.\nAccordingly, we develop BuStop, a system for extracting and characterizing the\nstay locations from multi-modal sensing using commuters' smartphones. Using\nthis multi-modal information BuStop extracts a set of granular contextual\nfeatures that allow the system to differentiate among the different\nstay-location types. A thorough analysis of BuStop using the collected dataset\nindicates that the system works with high accuracy in identifying different\nstay locations like regular bus stops, random ad-hoc stops, stops due to\ntraffic congestion stops at traffic signals, and stops at sharp turns.\nAdditionally, we also develop a proof-of-concept setup on top of BuStop to\nanalyze the potential of the framework in predicting expected arrival time, a\ncritical piece of information required to pre-plan travel, at any given bus\nstop. Subsequent analysis of the PoC framework, through simulation over the\ntest dataset, shows that characterizing the stay-locations indeed helps make\nmore accurate arrival time predictions with deviations less than 60s from the\nground-truth arrival time.",

    "abstract": "With the advances of data-driven machine learning research, a wide variety of\nprediction problems have been tackled. It has become critical to explore how\nmachine learning and specifically deep learning methods can be exploited to\nanalyse healthcare data. A major limitation of existing methods has been the\nfocus on grid-like data; however, the structure of physiological recordings are\noften irregular and unordered which makes it difficult to conceptualise them as\na matrix. As such, graph neural networks have attracted significant attention\nby exploiting implicit information that resides in a biological system, with\ninteractive nodes connected by edges whose weights can be either temporal\nassociations or anatomical junctions. In this survey, we thoroughly review the\ndifferent types of graph architectures and their applications in healthcare. We\nprovide an overview of these methods in a systematic manner, organized by their\ndomain of application including functional connectivity, anatomical structure\nand electrical-based analysis. We also outline the limitations of existing\ntechniques and discuss potential directions for future research.",

However, few prior works have thoroughly discussed about\nmodels for practical applications. Instead, they often focus on improving a\ncouple of issues at a time while ignoring the others. To bridge this gap, we\naim to explore a practical model that is accurate, robust, efficient,\ngeneralizable, and end-to-end trainable at the same time. To this end, we first\npropose a baseline model equipped with one transformer decoder as detection\nhead. In order to achieve a better accuracy, we further propose two lightweight\nmodules, namely dynamic query initialization (DQInit) and query-aware memory\n(QAMem). Specifically, DQInit dynamically initializes the queries of decoder\nfrom the inputs, enabling the model to achieve as good accuracy as the ones\nwith multiple decoder layers. QAMem is designed to enhance the discriminative\nability of queries on low-resolution feature maps by assigning separate memory\nvalues to each query rather than a shared one. With the help of QAMem, our\nmodel removes the dependence on high-resolution feature maps and is still able\nto obtain superior accuracy. Extensive experiments and analysis on three\npopular benchmarks show the effectiveness and practical advantages of the\nproposed model. Notably, our model achieves new state of the art on WFLW as\nwell as competitive results on 300W and COFW, while still running at 50+ FPS.",

    "abstract": "The mathematical approaches for modeling dynamic traffic can roughly be\ndivided into two categories: discrete packet routing models and continuous flow\nover time models. Despite very vital research activities on models in both\ncategories, the connection between these approaches was poorly understood so\nfar. In this work we build this connection by specifying a (competitive) packet\nrouting model, which is discrete in terms of flow and time, and by proving its\nconvergence to the intensively studied model of flows over time with\ndeterministic queuing. More precisely, we prove that the limit of the\nconvergence process, when decreasing the packet size and time step length in\nthe packet routing model, constitutes a flow over time with multiple\ncommodities. In addition, we show that the convergence result implies the\nexistence of approximate equilibria in the competitive version of the packet\nrouting model. This is of significant interest as exact pure Nash equilibria,\nsimilar to almost all other competitive models, cannot be guaranteed in the\nmulti-commodity setting. Moreover, the introduced packet routing model with\ndeterministic queuing is very application-oriented as it is based on the\nnetwork loading module of the agent-based transport simulation MATSim. As the\npresent work is the first mathematical formalization of this simulation, it\nprovides a theoretical foundation and an environment for provable mathematical\nstatements for MATSim.",

We\nconstruct a preconditioned iterative method with an adaptive rank truncation\nfor solving the equation for the control function, governed by a sum of the\nelliptic operator and its inverse $M=A + A^{-1}$, both discretized over large\n$n^{\\otimes d}$, $d=2,3$, spatial grids. Two basic solution schemes are\nproposed and analyzed. In the first approach, one solves iteratively the\ninitial linear system of equations with the matrix $M$ such that the matrix\nvector multiplication with the elliptic operator inverse, $y=A^{-1} u,$ is\nperformed as an embedded iteration by using a rank-structured solver for the\nequation of the form $A y=u$. The second numerical scheme avoids the embedded\niteration by reducing the initial equation to an equivalent one with the\npolynomial system matrix of the form $A^2 +I$. For both schemes, a low\nKronecker rank spectrally equivalent preconditioner is constructed by using the\ncorresponding matrix valued function of the anisotropic Laplacian diagonalized\nin the Fourier basis. Numerical tests for control problems in 2D setting\nconfirm the linear-quadratic complexity scaling of the proposed method in the\nunivariate grid size $n$.

    "abstract": "This paper explores whether graph embedding methods can be used as a tool for\nanalysing the robustness of power-grids within the framework of network\nscience. The paper focuses on the strain elevation tension spring embedding\n(SETSe) algorithm and compares it to node2vec and Deep Graph Infomax, and the\nmeasures mean edge capacity and line load. These five methods are tested on how\nwell they can predict the collapse point of the giant component of a network\nunder random attack. The analysis uses seven power-grid networks, ranging from\n14 to 2000 nodes. In total, 3456 load profiles are created for each network by\nloading the edges of the network to have a range of tolerances and\nconcentrating network capacity into fewer edges. One hundred random attack\nsequences are generated for each load profile, and the mean number of attacks\nrequired for the giant component to collapse for each profile is recorded. The\nrelationship between the embedding values for each load profile and the mean\ncollapse point is then compared across all five methods. It is found that only\nSETSe and line load perform well as proxies for robustness with $R^2 = 0.89$\nfor both measures. When tested on a time series normal operating conditions\nline load performs exceptionally well ($R=0.99$). However, the SETSe algorithm\nprovides valuable qualitative insight into the state of the power-grid by\nleveraging its method local smoothing and global weighting of node features to\nprovide an interpretable geographical embedding. This paper shows that graph\nrepresentation algorithms can be used to analyse network properties such as\nrobustness to cascading failure attacks, even when the network is embedded at\nnode level.",

    "title": "Measuring Fine-Grained Domain Relevance of Terms: A Hierarchical  Core-Fringe Approach",
    "abstract": "We propose to measure fine-grained domain relevance - the degree that a term\nis relevant to a broad (e.g., computer science) or narrow (e.g., deep learning)\ndomain. Such measurement is crucial for many downstream tasks in natural\nlanguage processing. To handle long-tail terms, we build a core-anchored\nsemantic graph, which uses core terms with rich description information to\nbridge the vast remaining fringe terms semantically. To support a fine-grained\ndomain without relying on a matching corpus for supervision, we develop\nhierarchical core-fringe learning, which learns core and fringe terms jointly\nin a semi-supervised manner contextualized in the hierarchy of the domain. To\nreduce expensive human efforts, we employ automatic annotation and hierarchical\npositive-unlabeled learning. Our approach applies to big or small domains,\ncovers head or tail terms, and requires little human effort. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our methods outperform strong baselines and even\nsurpass professional human performance.",

    "title": "OpenSerDes: An Open Source Process-Portable All-Digital Serial Link",
    "abstract": "In the last decade, the growing influence of open source software has\nnecessitated the need to reduce the abstraction levels in hardware design. Open\nsource hardware significantly reduces the development time, increasing the\nprobability of first-pass success and enable developers to optimize software\nsolutions based on hardware features, thereby reducing the design costs. The\nrecent introduction of open source Process Development Kit (OpenPDK) by\nSkywater technologies in June 2020 has eliminated the barriers to\nApplication-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) design, which is otherwise\nconsidered expensive and not easily accessible. The OpenPDK is the first\nconcrete step towards achieving the goal of open source circuit blocks that can\nbe imported to reuse and modify in ASIC design. With process technologies\nscaling down for better performance, the need for entirely digital designs,\nwhich can be synthesized in any standard Automatic Place-and-Route (APR) tool,\nhas increased considerably, for mapping physical design to the new process\ntechnology. This work presents the first open source all-digital\nSerializer/Deserializer (SerDes) for multi-GHz serial links designed using\nSkywater OpenPDK 130nm process node. To ensure that the design is fully\nsynthesizable, the SerDes uses CMOS inverter-based drivers at the Tx, while the\nRx front end comprises a resistive feedback inverter as a sensing element,\nfollowed by sampling elements. A fully digital oversampling CDR at the Rx\nrecovers the Tx clock for proper decoding of data bits. The physical design\nflow utilizes OpenLANE, which is an end-to-end tool for generating GDS from\nRTL. Virtuoso has been used for extracting parasitics for post-layout\nsimulations, which exhibit the SerDes functionality at 2 Gbps for 34 dB channel\nloss while consuming 438 mW power. The GDS and netlist files of the SerDes are\nuploaded in a GitHub repository for public access.",

    "abstract": "Most words are ambiguous--i.e., they convey distinct meanings in different\ncontexts--and even the meanings of unambiguous words are context-dependent.\nBoth phenomena present a challenge for NLP. Recently, the advent of\ncontextualized word embeddings has led to success on tasks involving lexical\nambiguity, such as Word Sense Disambiguation. However, there are few tasks that\ndirectly evaluate how well these contextualized embeddings accommodate the more\ncontinuous, dynamic nature of word meaning--particularly in a way that matches\nhuman intuitions. We introduce RAW-C, a dataset of graded, human relatedness\njudgments for 112 ambiguous words in context (with 672 sentence pairs total),\nas well as human estimates of sense dominance. The average inter-annotator\nagreement (assessed using a leave-one-annotator-out method) was 0.79. We then\nshow that a measure of cosine distance, computed using contextualized\nembeddings from BERT and ELMo, correlates with human judgments, but that cosine\ndistance also systematically underestimates how similar humans find uses of the\nsame sense of a word to be, and systematically overestimates how similar humans\nfind uses of different-sense homonyms. Finally, we propose a synthesis between\npsycholinguistic theories of the mental lexicon and computational models of\nlexical semantics.",

Modern\nvehicles are also connected to external networks through vehicle-to-everything\ntechnologies, enabling their communications with other vehicles,\ninfrastructures, and smart devices. However, the improving functionality and\nconnectivity of modern vehicles also increase their vulnerabilities to\ncyber-attacks targeting both intra-vehicle and external networks due to the\nlarge attack surfaces. To secure vehicular networks, many researchers have\nfocused on developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that capitalize on\nmachine learning methods to detect malicious cyber-attacks. In this paper, the\nvulnerabilities of intra-vehicle and external networks are discussed, and a\nmulti-tiered hybrid IDS that incorporates a signature-based IDS and an\nanomaly-based IDS is proposed to detect both known and unknown attacks on\nvehicular networks. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed system\ncan detect various types of known attacks with 99.99% accuracy on the\nCAN-intrusion-dataset representing the intra-vehicle network data and 99.88%\naccuracy on the CICIDS2017 dataset illustrating the external vehicular network\ndata.

A thematic analysis\nwas also conducted on participants' experiences with the vibrotactile display\nand what methods of interaction they used.

Presently, deep neural networks can be deployed on embedded\ntargets to perform different tasks such as speech recognition,object detection\nor Human Activity Recognition. However, there is still room for optimization of\ndeep neural networks onto embedded devices. These optimizations mainly address\npower consumption,memory and real-time constraints, but also an easier\ndeployment at the edge. Moreover, there is still a need for a better\nunderstanding of what can be achieved for different use cases. This work\nfocuses on quantization and deployment of deep neural networks onto low-power\n32-bit microcontrollers. The quantization methods, relevant in the context of\nan embedded execution onto a microcontroller, are first outlined. Then, a new\nframework for end-to-end deep neural networks training, quantization and\ndeployment is presented. This framework, called MicroAI, is designed as an\nalternative to existing inference engines (TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers\nand STM32Cube.AI). Our framework can indeed be easily adjusted and/or extended\nfor specific use cases. Execution using single precision 32-bit floating-point\nas well as fixed-point on 8- and 16-bit integers are supported. The proposed\nquantization method is evaluated with three different datasets (UCI-HAR, Spoken\nMNIST and GTSRB). Finally, a comparison study between MicroAI and both existing\nembedded inference engines is provided in terms of memory and power efficiency.\nOn-device evaluation is done using ARM Cortex-M4F-based microcontrollers (Ambiq\nApollo3 and STM32L452RE).",

This is in contrast with prior\nworks where representation learning and online clustering are often performed\nsequentially. We leverage temporal information in videos by employing temporal\noptimal transport and temporal coherence loss. In particular, we incorporate a\ntemporal regularization term into the standard optimal transport module, which\npreserves the temporal order of the activity, yielding the temporal optimal\ntransport module for computing pseudo-label cluster assignments. Next, the\ntemporal coherence loss encourages neighboring video frames to be mapped to\nnearby points while distant video frames are mapped to farther away points in\nthe embedding space. The combination of these two components results in\neffective representations for unsupervised activity segmentation. Furthermore,\nprevious methods require storing learned features for the entire dataset before\nclustering them in an offline manner, whereas our approach processes one\nmini-batch at a time in an online manner.

In quantum information and beyond,\nit is known that quantum states possessing symmetry are not useful for certain\ninformation-processing tasks. For example, states that commute with a\nHamiltonian realizing a time evolution are not useful for timekeeping during\nthat evolution, and bipartite states that are highly extendible are not\nstrongly entangled and thus not useful for basic tasks like teleportation.\nMotivated by this perspective, this paper details several quantum algorithms\nthat test the symmetry of quantum states and channels. For the case of testing\nBose symmetry of a state, we show that there is a simple and efficient quantum\nalgorithm, while the tests for other kinds of symmetry rely on the aid of a\nquantum prover. We prove that the acceptance probability of each algorithm is\nequal to the maximum symmetric fidelity of the state being tested, thus giving\na firm operational meaning to these latter resource quantifiers. Special cases\nof the algorithms test for incoherence or separability of quantum states. We\nevaluate the performance of these algorithms by using the variational approach\nto quantum algorithms, replacing the quantum prover with a variational circuit.\nWe also show that the maximum symmetric fidelities can be calculated by\nsemi-definite programs, which is useful for benchmarking the performance of the\nquantum algorithms for sufficiently small examples.

Here we present XOmiVAE, a novel\ninterpretable deep learning model for cancer classification using\nhigh-dimensional omics data. XOmiVAE is able to obtain contribution values of\neach gene and latent dimension for a specific prediction, and the correlation\nbetween genes and the latent dimensions. It is also revealed that XOmiVAE can\nexplain both the supervised classification and the unsupervised clustering\nresults from the deep learning network. To the best of our knowledge, XOmiVAE\nis one of the first activated-based deep learning interpretation method to\nexplain novel clusters generated by variational autoencoders. The results\ngenerated by XOmiVAE were validated by both the biomedical knowledge and the\nperformance of downstream tasks. XOmiVAE explanations of deep learning based\ncancer classification and clustering aligned with current domain knowledge\nincluding biological annotation and literature, which shows great potential for\nnovel biomedical knowledge discovery from deep learning models. The top XOmiVAE\nselected genes and dimensions shown significant influence to the performance of\ncancer classification.

One difficulty in flow-based generative modeling is to\nmaintain the invertibility of the transport map, which is often a trade-off\nbetween effectiveness and robustness. The exact invertibility has been achieved\nin the real NVP using a specific pattern to exchange information between two\nseparated groups of dimensions. KRnet has been developed to enhance the\ninformation exchange among data dimensions by incorporating the\nKnothe-Rosenblatt rearrangement into the structure of the transport map. Due to\nthe maintenance of exact invertibility, a full nonlinear update of all data\ndimensions needs three iterations in KRnet. To alleviate this issue, we will\nadd augmented dimensions that act as a channel for communications among the\ndata dimensions. In the augmented KRnet, a fully nonlinear update is achieved\nin two iterations. We also show that the augmented KRnet can be reformulated as\nthe discretization of a neural ODE, where the exact invertibility is kept such\nthat the adjoint method can be formulated with respect to the discretized ODE\nto obtain the exact gradient.

    "abstract": "With the capability of accurately representing a functional relationship\nbetween the inputs of a physical system's model and output quantities of\ninterest, neural networks have become popular for surrogate modeling in\nscientific applications. However, as these networks are over-parameterized,\ntheir training often requires a large amount of data. To prevent overfitting\nand improve generalization error, regularization based on, e.g., $\\ell_1$- and\n$\\ell_2$-norms of the parameters is applied. Similarly, multiple connections of\nthe network may be pruned to increase sparsity in the network parameters. In\nthis paper, we explore the effects of sparsity promoting\n$\\ell_1$-regularization on training neural networks when only a small training\ndataset from a high-fidelity model is available. As opposed to standard\n$\\ell_1$-regularization that is known to be inadequate, we consider two\nvariants of $\\ell_1$-regularization informed by the parameters of an identical\nnetwork trained using data from lower-fidelity models of the problem at hand.\nThese bi-fidelity strategies are generalizations of transfer learning of neural\nnetworks that uses the parameters learned from a large low-fidelity dataset to\nefficiently train networks for a small high-fidelity dataset. We also compare\nthe bi-fidelity strategies with two $\\ell_1$-regularization methods that only\nuse the high-fidelity dataset. Three numerical examples for propagating\nuncertainty through physical systems are used to show that the proposed\nbi-fidelity $\\ell_1$-regularization strategies produce errors that are one\norder of magnitude smaller than those of networks trained only using datasets\nfrom the high-fidelity models.",

    "abstract": "Most consumer-grade digital cameras can only capture a limited range of\nluminance in real-world scenes due to sensor constraints. Besides, noise and\nquantization errors are often introduced in the imaging process. In order to\nobtain high dynamic range (HDR) images with excellent visual quality, the most\ncommon solution is to combine multiple images with different exposures.\nHowever, it is not always feasible to obtain multiple images of the same scene\nand most HDR reconstruction methods ignore the noise and quantization loss. In\nthis work, we propose a novel learning-based approach using a spatially dynamic\nencoder-decoder network, HDRUNet, to learn an end-to-end mapping for single\nimage HDR reconstruction with denoising and dequantization. The network\nconsists of a UNet-style base network to make full use of the hierarchical\nmulti-scale information, a condition network to perform pattern-specific\nmodulation and a weighting network for selectively retaining information.\nMoreover, we propose a Tanh_L1 loss function to balance the impact of\nover-exposed values and well-exposed values on the network learning. Our method\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance in quantitative comparisons and\nvisual quality. The proposed HDRUNet model won the second place in the single\nframe track of NITRE2021 High Dynamic Range Challenge.",

    "abstract": "We study the approximation power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on latent\nposition random graphs. In the large graph limit, GNNs are known to converge to\ncertain \"continuous\" models known as c-GNNs, which directly enables a study of\ntheir approximation power on random graph models. In the absence of input node\nfeatures however, just as GNNs are limited by the Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism\ntest, c-GNNs will be severely limited on simple random graph models. For\ninstance, they will fail to distinguish the communities of a well-separated\nStochastic Block Model (SBM) with constant degree function. Thus, we consider\nrecently proposed architectures that augment GNNs with unique node identifiers,\nsometimes referred to as Graph Wavelets Neural Networks (GWNNs). We study the\nconvergence of GWNNs to their continuous counterpart (c-GWNNs) in the large\nrandom graph limit, under new conditions on the node identifiers. We then show\nthat c-GWNNs are strictly more powerful than c-GNNs in the continuous limit,\nand prove their universality on several random graph models of interest,\nincluding most SBMs and a large class of random geometric graphs. Our results\ncover both permutation-invariant and permutation-equivariant architectures.",

To date, there are fewer than 30,000 validated NPs compounds\ninvolved in about 33,000 known enzyme catalytic reactions, and even fewer\nbiosynthetic pathways are known with complete cascade-connected enzyme\ncatalysis. Therefore, it is valuable to make computer-aided bio-retrosynthesis\npredictions.

Extensive evaluations\nreveal that BioNavi-NP generalizes well to identifying the reported\nbiosynthetic pathways for 90% of test compounds and recovering the verified\nbuilding blocks for 73%, significantly outperforming conventional rule-based\napproaches. Moreover, BioNavi-NP also shows an outstanding capacity of\nbiologically plausible pathways enumeration.

    "abstract": "Cardiac segmentation of atriums, ventricles, and myocardium in computed\ntomography (CT) images is an important first-line task for presymptomatic\ncardiovascular disease diagnosis. In several recent studies, deep learning\nmodels have shown significant breakthroughs in medical image segmentation\ntasks. Unlike other organs such as the lungs and liver, the cardiac organ\nconsists of multiple substructures, i.e., ventricles, atriums, aortas,\narteries, veins, and myocardium. These cardiac substructures are proximate to\neach other and have indiscernible boundaries (i.e., homogeneous intensity\nvalues), making it difficult for the segmentation network focus on the\nboundaries between the substructures. In this paper, to improve the\nsegmentation accuracy between proximate organs, we introduce a novel model to\nexploit shape and boundary-aware features. We primarily propose a shape-aware\nattention module, that exploits distance regression, which can guide the model\nto focus on the edges between substructures so that it can outperform the\nconventional contour-based attention method. In the experiments, we used the\nMulti-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation dataset that has 20 CT cardiac images\nfor training and validation, and 40 CT cardiac images for testing. The\nexperimental results show that the proposed network produces more accurate\nresults than state-of-the-art networks by improving the Dice similarity\ncoefficient score by 4.97%. Our proposed shape-aware contour attention\nmechanism demonstrates that distance transformation and boundary features\nimprove the actual attention map to strengthen the responses in the boundary\narea. Moreover, our proposed method significantly reduces the false-positive\nresponses of the final output, resulting in accurate segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Sorted l1 regularization has been incorporated into many methods for solving\nhigh-dimensional statistical estimation problems, including the SLOPE estimator\nin linear regression. In this paper, we study how this relatively new\nregularization technique improves variable selection by characterizing the\noptimal SLOPE trade-off between the false discovery proportion (FDP) and true\npositive proportion (TPP) or, equivalently, between measures of type I error\nand power. Assuming a regime of linear sparsity and working under Gaussian\nrandom designs, we obtain an upper bound on the optimal trade-off for SLOPE,\nshowing its capability of breaking the Donoho-Tanner power limit. To put it\ninto perspective, this limit is the highest possible power that the Lasso,\nwhich is perhaps the most popular l1-based method, can achieve even with\narbitrarily strong effect sizes. Next, we derive a tight lower bound that\ndelineates the fundamental limit of sorted l1 regularization in optimally\ntrading the FDP off for the TPP. Finally, we show that on any problem instance,\nSLOPE with a certain regularization sequence outperforms the Lasso, in the\nsense of having a smaller FDP, larger TPP and smaller l2 estimation risk\nsimultaneously. Our proofs are based on a novel technique that reduces a\nvariational calculus problem to a class of infinite-dimensional convex\noptimization problems and a very recent result from approximate message passing\ntheory.",
