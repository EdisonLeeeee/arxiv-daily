    "abstract": "Real-world graphs are massive in size and we need a huge amount of space to\nstore them. Graph compression allows us to compress a graph so that we need a\nlesser number of bits per link to store it. Of many techniques to compress a\ngraph, a typical approach is to find clique-like caveman or traditional\ncommunities in a graph and encode those cliques to compress the graph. On the\nother side, an alternative approach is to consider graphs as a collection of\nhubs connecting spokes and exploit it to arrange the nodes such that the\nresulting adjacency matrix of the graph can be compressed more efficiently. We\nperform an empirical comparison of these two approaches and show that both\nmethods can yield good results under favorable conditions. We perform our\nexperiments on ten real-world graphs and define two cost functions to present\nour findings.",

The proposed\nmodels are able to automatically adapt to very dissimilar arrangements without\nany apriori estimates of graph features.

Our key contribution is a novel algorithmic\napproach, Simplified Information Theoretic Belief Space Planning (SITH-BSP),\nwhich aims to speed-up POMDP planning considering belief-dependent rewards,\nwithout compromising on the solution's accuracy. We do so by mathematically\nrelating the simplified elements of the problem to the corresponding\ncounterparts of the original problem. Specifically, we focus on belief\nsimplification and use it to formulate bounds on the corresponding original\nbelief-dependent rewards. These bounds in turn are used to perform branch\npruning over the belief tree, in the process of calculating the optimal policy.\nWe further introduce the notion of adaptive simplification, while re-using\ncalculations between different simplification levels and exploit it to prune,\nat each level in the belief tree, all branches but one. Therefore, our approach\nis guaranteed to find the optimal solution of the original problem but with\nsubstantial speedup. As a second key contribution, we derive novel analytical\nbounds for differential entropy, considering a sampling-based belief\nrepresentation, which we believe are of interest on their own. We validate our\napproach in simulation using these bounds and where simplification corresponds\nto reducing the number of samples, exhibiting a significant computational\nspeedup while yielding the optimal solution.",

    "abstract": "Recovering expressive humans from images is essential for understanding human\nbehavior. Methods that estimate 3D bodies, faces, or hands have progressed\nsignificantly, yet separately. Face methods recover accurate 3D shape and\ngeometric details, but need a tight crop and struggle with extreme views and\nlow resolution. Whole-body methods are robust to a wide range of poses and\nresolutions, but provide only a rough 3D face shape without details like\nwrinkles. To get the best of both worlds, we introduce PIXIE, which produces\nanimatable, whole-body 3D avatars from a single image, with realistic facial\ndetail. To get accurate whole bodies, PIXIE uses two key observations. First,\nbody parts are correlated, but existing work combines independent estimates\nfrom body, face, and hand experts, by trusting them equally. PIXIE introduces a\nnovel moderator that merges the features of the experts, weighted by their\nconfidence. Uniquely, part experts can contribute to the whole, using SMPL-X's\nshared shape space across all body parts. Second, human shape is highly\ncorrelated with gender, but existing work ignores this. We label training\nimages as male, female, or non-binary, and train PIXIE to infer \"gendered\" 3D\nbody shapes with a novel shape loss. In addition to 3D body pose and shape\nparameters, PIXIE estimates expression, illumination, albedo and 3D surface\ndisplacements for the face. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation shows that\nPIXIE estimates 3D humans with a more accurate whole-body shape and detailed\nface shape than the state of the art.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of dividing limited resources to individuals arriving\nover $T$ rounds. Each round has a random number of individuals arrive, and\nindividuals can be characterized by their type (i.e. preferences over the\ndifferent resources). A standard notion of `fairness' in this setting is that\nan allocation simultaneously satisfy envy-freeness and efficiency. The former\nis an individual guarantee, requiring that each agent prefers her own\nallocation over the allocation of any other; in contrast, efficiency is a\nglobal property, requiring that the allocations clear the available resources.\nFor divisible resources, when the number of individuals of each type are known\nupfront, the above desiderata are simultaneously achievable for a large class\nof utility functions. However, in an online setting when the number of\nindividuals of each type are only revealed round by round, no policy can\nguarantee these desiderata simultaneously, and hence the best one can do is to\ntry and allocate so as to approximately satisfy the two properties.\nWe show that in the online setting, the two desired properties (envy-freeness\nand efficiency) are in direct contention, in that any algorithm achieving\nadditive envy-freeness up to a factor of $L_T$ necessarily suffers an\nefficiency loss of at least $1 / L_T$. We complement this uncertainty principle\nwith a simple algorithm, HopeGuardrail, which allocates resources based on an\nadaptive threshold policy. We show that our algorithm is able to achieve any\nfairness-efficiency point on this frontier, and moreover, in simulation\nresults, provides allocations close to the optimal fair solution in hindsight.\nThis motivates its use in practical applications, as the algorithm is able to\nadapt to any desired fairness efficiency trade-off.",

DGEN is\ndesigned as a two-step graph encoder connected by a graph pooling layer, which\nlearns the graph embedding of the selected nodes. Based on the assumption that\na node and its nearest neighbors should belong to the same cluster, we devise\nthe neighbor cluster pooling(NCPool) to select the most informative subset of\nvertices based on the clustering assignments of nodes and their nearest\nneighbor. This can effectively alleviate the impact of the noise edge to the\nclustering. After obtaining the clustering assignments of the selected nodes, a\nclassifier is trained using these selected nodes and the final clustering\nassignments for all the nodes can be obtained by this classifier.

In such\nenvironments, the error between the system output and the label also does not\nfollow a Gaussian distribution and there might exist abnormally large error\nsamples (or outliers) which mislead the learning process. The main challenge is\nhow to keep the supervised learning problem least affected by these unwanted\nand misleading outliers. In recent years, an information theoretic algorithm\nbased on Renyi's entropy, called minimum error entropy (MEE), has been employed\nto take on this issue.

    "title": "SmartOil: Blockchain and smart contract-based oil supply chain  management",
    "abstract": "The traditional oil supply chain suffers from various shortcomings regarding\ncrude oil extraction, processing, distribution, environmental pollution, and\ntraceability. It offers an only a forward flow of products with almost no\nsecurity and tracking process. In time, the system will lag behind due to the\nlimitations in quality inspection, fraudulent information, and monopolistic\nbehavior of supply chain entities. Inclusion of counterfeiting products and\nopaqueness of the system urge renovation in this sector. The recent evolution\nof Industry 4.0 leads to the alternation in the supply chain introducing the\nsmart supply chain. Technological advancement can now reshape the\ninfrastructure of the supply chain for the future. In this paper, we suggest a\nconceptual framework utilizing Blockchain and Smart Contract to monitor the\noverall oil supply chain. Blockchain is a groundbreaking technology to monitor\nand support the security building of a decentralized type supply chain over a\npeer-to-peer network. The use of the Internet of Things (IoT), especially\nsensors, opens broader window to track the global supply chain in real-time. We\nconstruct a methodology to support reverse traceability for each participant of\nthe supply chain. The functions and characteristics of Blockchain and Smart\nContract are defined. Implementation of Smart Contracts has also been shown\nwith detailed analysis. We further describe the challenges of implementing such\na system and validate our framework's adaptability in the real world. The paper\nconcludes with future research scope to mitigate the restrictions of data\nmanagement and maintenance with advanced working prototypes and agile systems\nachieving greater traceability and transparency.",

    "abstract": "Haptic feedback is critical in a broad range of\nhuman-machine/computer-interaction applications. However, the high cost and low\nportability/wearability of haptic devices remains an unresolved issue, severely\nlimiting the adoption of this otherwise promising technology. Electrotactile\ninterfaces have the advantage of being more portable and wearable due to its\nreduced actuators' size, as well as benefiting from lower power consumption and\nmanufacturing cost. The usages of electrotactile feedback have been explored in\nhuman-computer interaction and human-machine-interaction for facilitating\nhand-based interactions in applications such as prosthetics, virtual reality,\nrobotic teleoperation, surface haptics, portable devices, and rehabilitation.\nThis paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of electrotactile\nfeedback systems for hand-based interactions in the last decade. We categorize\nthe different electrotactile systems according to their type of stimulation and\nimplementation/application. We also present and discuss a quantitative\ncongregation of the findings, so as to offer a high-level overview into the\nstate-of-art and suggest future directions. Electrotactile feedback was\nsuccessful in rendering and/or augmenting most tactile sensations, eliciting\nperceptual processes, and improving performance in many scenarios, especially\nin those where the wearability/portability of the system is important. However,\nknowledge gaps, technical drawbacks, and methodological limitations were\ndetected, which should be addressed in future studies.",

This need for data can be countered by using\nunsupervised learning in situations where data are abundant but access to\nannotations is limited.

    "abstract": "Video Frame Interpolation synthesizes non-existent images between adjacent\nframes, with the aim of providing a smooth and consistent visual experience.\nTwo approaches for solving this challenging task are optical flow based and\nkernel-based methods. In existing works, optical flow based methods can provide\naccurate point-to-point motion description, however, they lack constraints on\nobject structure. On the contrary, kernel-based methods focus on structural\nalignment, which relies on semantic and apparent features, but tends to blur\nresults. Based on these observations, we propose a structure-motion based\niterative fusion method. The framework is an end-to-end learnable structure\nwith two stages. First, interpolated frames are synthesized by structure-based\nand motion-based learning branches respectively, then, an iterative refinement\nmodule is established via spatial and temporal feature integration. Inspired by\nthe observation that audiences have different visual preferences on foreground\nand background objects, we for the first time propose to use saliency masks in\nthe evaluation processes of the task of video frame interpolation. Experimental\nresults on three typical benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves\nsuperior performance on all evaluation metrics over the state-of-the-art\nmethods, even when our models are trained with only one-tenth of the data other\nmethods use.",

Many Hamilton-Jacobi equations have a nonlinear\ndependency on the gradient of the solution, which gives rise to discontinuities\nin the gradient of the solution, resulting in kinks in the solution itself. We\nbuilt our solver with two goals in mind: 1) high order accuracy in smooth\nregions and 2) sharp resolution of kinks. To achieve this, we use Hermite\ninterpolation with a smoothness sensor. The degrees-of-freedom of Hermite\nmethods are tensor-product Taylor polynomials of degree $m$ in each coordinate\ndirection. The method uses $(m+1)^d$ degrees of freedom per node in\n$d$-dimensions and achieves an order of accuracy $(2m+1)$ when the solution is\nsmooth. To obtain sharp resolution of kinks, we sense the smoothness of the\nsolution on each cell at each timestep. If the solution is smooth, we march the\ninterpolant forward in time with no modifications. When our method encounters a\ncell over which the solution is not smooth, it introduces artificial viscosity\nlocally while proceeding normally in smooth regions. We show through numerical\nexperiments that the solver sharply captures kinks once the solution losses\ncontinuity in the derivative while achieving $2m+1$ order accuracy in smooth\nregions.",

    "abstract": "In an adversarial environment, a hostile player performing a task may behave\nlike a non-hostile one in order not to reveal its identity to an opponent. To\nmodel such a scenario, we define identity concealment games: zero-sum\nstochastic reachability games with a zero-sum objective of identity\nconcealment. To measure the identity concealment of the player, we introduce\nthe notion of an average player. The average player's policy represents the\nexpected behavior of a non-hostile player. We show that there exists an\nequilibrium policy pair for every identity concealment game and give the\noptimality equations to synthesize an equilibrium policy pair. If the player's\nopponent follows a non-equilibrium policy, the player can hide its identity\nbetter. For this reason, we study how the hostile player may learn the\nopponent's policy. Since learning via exploration policies would quickly reveal\nthe hostile player's identity to the opponent, we consider the problem of\nlearning a near-optimal policy for the hostile player using the game runs\ncollected under the average player's policy. Consequently, we propose an\nalgorithm that provably learns a near-optimal policy and give an upper bound on\nthe number of sample runs to be collected.",

    "abstract": "Deep ensemble learning aims to improve the classification accuracy by\ntraining several neural networks and fusing their outputs. It has been widely\nshown to improve accuracy. At the same time, ensemble learning has also been\nproposed to mitigate privacy leakage in terms of membership inference (MI),\nwhere the goal of an attacker is to infer whether a particular data sample has\nbeen used to train a target model. In this paper, we show that these two goals\nof ensemble learning, namely improving accuracy and privacy, directly conflict\nwith each other. Using a wide range of datasets and model architectures, we\nempirically demonstrate the trade-off between privacy and accuracy in deep\nensemble learning. We find that ensembling can improve either privacy or\naccuracy, but not both simultaneously -- when ensembling improves the\nclassification accuracy, the effectiveness of the MI attack also increases. We\nanalyze various factors that contribute to such privacy leakage in ensembling\nsuch as prediction confidence and agreement between models that constitute the\nensemble. Our evaluation of defenses against MI attacks, such as regularization\nand differential privacy, shows that they can mitigate the effectiveness of the\nMI attack but simultaneously degrade ensemble accuracy.

    "abstract": "A commonly-cited reason for the poor performance of automatic chord\nestimation (ACE) systems within music information retrieval (MIR) is that\nnon-chord tones (i.e., notes outside the supporting harmony) contribute to\nerror during the labeling process. Despite the prevalence of machine learning\napproaches in MIR, there are cases where alternative approaches provide a\nsimpler alternative while allowing for insights into musicological practices.\nIn this project, we present a statistical model for predicting chord tones\nbased on music theory rules. Our model is currently focused on predicting chord\ntones in classical music, since composition in this style is highly\nconstrained, theoretically making the placement of chord tones highly\npredictable. Indeed, music theorists have labeling systems for every variety of\nnon-chord tone, primarily classified by the note's metric position and\nintervals of approach and departure. Using metric position, duration, and\nmelodic intervals as predictors, we build a statistical model for predicting\nchord tones using the TAVERN dataset. While our probabilistic approach is\nsimilar to other efforts in the domain of automatic harmonic analysis, our\nfocus is on melodic reduction rather than predicting harmony. However, we hope\nto pursue applications for ACE in the future. Finally, we implement our melody\nreduction model using an existing symbolic visualization tool, to assist with\nmelody reduction and non-chord tone identification for computational musicology\nresearchers and music theorists.",

    "title": "Bayesian Model Averaging for Data Driven Decision Making when Causality  is Partially Known",
    "abstract": "Probabilistic machine learning models are often insufficient to help with\ndecisions on interventions because those models find correlations - not causal\nrelationships. If observational data is only available and experimentation are\ninfeasible, the correct approach to study the impact of an intervention is to\ninvoke Pearl's causality framework. Even that framework assumes that the\nunderlying causal graph is known, which is seldom the case in practice. When\nthe causal structure is not known, one may use out-of-the-box algorithms to\nfind causal dependencies from observational data. However, there exists no\nmethod that also accounts for the decision-maker's prior knowledge when\ndeveloping the causal structure either. The objective of this paper is to\ndevelop rational approaches for making decisions from observational data in the\npresence of causal graph uncertainty and prior knowledge from the\ndecision-maker. We use ensemble methods like Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to\ninfer set of causal graphs that can represent the data generation process. We\nprovide decisions by computing the expected value and risk of potential\ninterventions explicitly. We demonstrate our approach by applying them in\ndifferent example contexts.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose and develop efficient and accurate numerical methods\nfor solving the Kirchhoff-Love plate model in domains with complex geometries.\nThe algorithms proposed here employ curvilinear finite-difference methods for\nspatial discretization of the governing PDEs on general composite overlapping\ngrids. The coupling of different components of the composite overlapping grid\nis through numerical interpolations. However, interpolations introduce\nperturbation to the finite-difference discretization, which causes numerical\ninstability for time-stepping schemes used to advance the resulted\nsemi-discrete system. To address the instability, we propose to add a\nfourth-order hyper-dissipation to the spatially discretized system to stabilize\nits time integration; this additional dissipation term captures the essential\nupwinding effect of the original upwind scheme. The investigation of strategies\nfor incorporating the upwind dissipation term into several time-stepping\nschemes (both explicit and implicit) leads to the development of four novel\nalgorithms. For each algorithm, formulas for determining a stable time step and\na sufficient dissipation coefficient on curvilinear grids are derived by\nperforming a local Fourier analysis. Quadratic eigenvalue problems for a\nsimplified model plate in 1D domain are considered to reveal the weak\ninstability due to the presence of interpolating equations in the spatial\ndiscretization. This model problem is further investigated for the\nstabilization effects of the proposed algorithms. Carefully designed numerical\nexperiments are carried out to validate the accuracy and stability of the\nproposed algorithms, followed by two benchmark problems to demonstrate the\ncapability and efficiency of our approach for solving realistic applications.\nResults that concern the performance of the proposed algorithms are also\npresented.",

    "abstract": "Recently, lane detection has made great progress with the rapid development\nof deep neural networks and autonomous driving. However, there exist three\nmainly problems including characterizing lanes, modeling the structural\nrelationship between scenes and lanes, and supporting more attributes (e.g.,\ninstance and type) of lanes. In this paper, we propose a novel structure guided\nframework to solve these problems simultaneously. In the framework, we first\nintroduce a new lane representation to characterize each instance. Then a\ntopdown vanishing point guided anchoring mechanism is proposed to produce\nintensive anchors, which efficiently capture various lanes. Next, multi-level\nstructural constraints are used to improve the perception of lanes. In the\nprocess, pixel-level perception with binary segmentation is introduced to\npromote features around anchors and restore lane details from bottom up, a\nlane-level relation is put forward to model structures (i.e., parallel) around\nlanes, and an image-level attention is used to adaptively attend different\nregions of the image from the perspective of scenes. With the help of\nstructural guidance, anchors are effectively classified and regressed to obtain\nprecise locations and shapes.

In\nthis work, we build a new food image dataset FoodSeg103 (and its extension\nFoodSeg154) containing 9,490 images. We annotate these images with 154\ningredient classes and each image has an average of 6 ingredient labels and\npixel-wise masks.

As a result, solving the problem repeatedly is required to obtain\nstatistical quantities. Besides, the medium properties are usually highly\nheterogeneous, which will result in a large linear system that needs to be\nsolved. Therefore, it is intrinsically inevitable to seek a\ncomputational-efficient model reduction method to overcome the difficulty. We\nwill explore the combination of the reduced basis method and the GMsFEM. In\nparticular, we will use residual-driven basis functions, which are key\ningredients in GMsFEM.

This is a\nrobust approach that can deal with bounded parametric uncertainties in the\nprocess model, which are commonly encountered in industrial (chemical)\nprocesses.

    "abstract": "In high speed CNC (Compute Numerical Control) machining, the feed rate\nscheduling has played an important role to ensure machining quality and\nmachining efficiency. In this paper, a novel feed rate scheduling method is\nproposed for generating smooth feed rate profile conveniently with the\nconsideration of both geometric error and kinematic error. First, a\nrelationship between feed rate value and chord error is applied to determine\nthe feed rate curve. Then, breaking points, which can split whole curve into\nseveral blocks, can be found out using proposed two step screening method. For\nevery block, a feed rate profile based on the Sigmoid function is generated.\nWith the consideration of kinematic limitation and machining efficiency, a\ntime-optimal feed rate adjustment algorithm is proposed to further adjust feed\nrate value at breaking points. After planning feed rate profile for each block,\nall blocks feed rate profile will be connected smoothly. The resulting feed\nrate profile is more concise compared with the polynomial profile and more\nefficient compared with the trigonometric profile. Finally, simulations with\ntwo free-form NURBS curves are conducted and comparison with the sine-curve\nmethod are carried out to verify the feasibility and applicability of the\nproposed method.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has made people's lives\nmore convenient, but it has also raised many security concerns. Due to the\ndifficulty of obtaining and emulating IoT firmware, the black-box fuzzing of\nIoT devices has become a viable option. However, existing black-box fuzzers\ncannot form effective mutation optimization mechanisms to guide their testing\nprocesses, mainly due to the lack of feedback. It is difficult or even\nimpossible to apply existing grammar-based fuzzing strategies. Therefore, an\nefficient fuzzing approach with syntax inference is required in the IoT fuzzing\ndomain. To address these critical problems, we propose a novel automatic\nblack-box fuzzing for IoT firmware, termed Snipuzz. Snipuzz runs as a client\ncommunicating with the devices and infers message snippets for mutation based\non the responses. Each snippet refers to a block of consecutive bytes that\nreflect the approximate code coverage in fuzzing. This mutation strategy based\non message snippets considerably narrows down the search space to change the\nprobing messages. We compared Snipuzz with four state-of-the-art IoT fuzzing\napproaches, i.e., IoTFuzzer, BooFuzz, Doona, and Nemesys. Snipuzz not only\ninherits the advantages of app-based fuzzing (e.g., IoTFuzzer, but also\nutilizes communication responses to perform efficient mutation. Furthermore,\nSnipuzz is lightweight as its execution does not rely on any prerequisite\noperations, such as reverse engineering of apps. We also evaluated Snipuzz on\n20 popular real-world IoT devices. Our results show that Snipuzz could identify\n5 zero-day vulnerabilities, and 3 of them could be exposed only by Snipuzz. All\nthe newly discovered vulnerabilities have been confirmed by their vendors.",

Contemporary software teams rely on\na variety of collaborative practices, such as pair programming, the topic of\nour study. Many agilists advocated the importance of collocation, face-to-face\ninteraction, and physical artefacts incorporated in the shared workspace, which\nthe COVID-19 pandemic made unavailable; most software companies around the\nworld were forced to send their engineers to work from home. As software\nprojects and teams overnight turned into dis-tributed collaborations, we\nquestion what happened to the pair programming practice in the work-from-home\nmode. This paper reports on a longitudinal study of remote pair programming in\ntwo companies. We conducted 38 interviews with 30 engineers from Norway,\nSweden, and the USA, and used the results of a survey in one of the case\ncompanies. Our study is unique as we collected the data longitudinally in\nApril/May 2020, Sep/Oct 2020, and Jan/Feb 2021. We found that pair programming\nhas decreased and some interviewees report not pairing at all for almost a full\nyear.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of inferring the graph structure from a given set of\nsmooth graph signals. The number of perceived graph signals is always finite\nand possibly noisy, thus the statistical properties of the data distribution is\nambiguous. Traditional graph learning models do not take this distributional\nuncertainty into account, thus performance may be sensitive to different sets\nof data. In this paper, we propose a distributionally robust approach to graph\nlearning, which incorporates the first and second moment uncertainty into the\nsmooth graph learning model. Specifically, we cast our graph learning model as\na minimax optimization problem, and further reformulate it as a nonconvex\nminimization problem with linear constraints. In our proposed formulation, we\nfind a theoretical interpretation of the Laplacian regularizer, which is\nadopted in many existing works in an intuitive manner. Although the first\nmoment uncertainty leads to an annoying square root term in the objective\nfunction, we prove that it enjoys the smoothness property with probability 1\nover the entire constraint. We develop a efficient projected gradient descent\n(PGD) method and establish its global iterate convergence to a critical point.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data to verify the\neffectiveness of our model and the efficiency of the PGD algorithm.

    "abstract": "In recent years, the robotics community has made substantial progress in\nrobotic manipulation using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Effectively\nlearning of long-horizon tasks remains a challenging topic. Typical RL-based\nmethods approximate long-horizon tasks as Markov decision processes and only\nconsider current observation (images or other sensor information) as input\nstate. However, such approximation ignores the fact that skill-sequence also\nplays a crucial role in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we take both the\nobservation and skill sequences into account and propose a\nskill-sequence-dependent hierarchical policy for solving a typical long-horizon\ntask. The proposed policy consists of a high-level skill policy (utilizing\nskill sequences) and a low-level parameter policy (responding to observation)\nwith corresponding training methods, which makes the learning much more\nsample-efficient. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that our approach\nsuccessfully solves a long-horizon task and is significantly faster than\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the task schema methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study covert communications between {a pair of} legitimate\ntransmitter-receiver against a watchful warden over slow fading channels. There\ncoexist multiple friendly helper nodes who are willing to protect the covert\ncommunication from being detected by the warden. We propose an uncoordinated\njammer selection scheme where those helpers whose instantaneous channel gains\nto the legitimate receiver fall below a pre-established selection threshold\nwill be chosen as jammers radiating jamming signals to defeat the warden. By\ndoing so, the detection accuracy of the warden is expected to be severely\ndegraded while the desired covert communication is rarely affected. We then\njointly design the optimal selection threshold and message transmission rate\nfor maximizing covert throughput under the premise that the detection error of\nthe warden exceeds a certain level. Numerical results are presented to validate\nour theoretical analyses. It is shown that the multi-jammer assisted covert\ncommunication outperforms the conventional single-jammer method in terms of\ncovert throughput, and the maximal covert throughput improves significantly as\nthe total number of helpers increases, which demonstrates the validity and\nsuperiority of our proposed scheme.",

The widely-used\nFixed-Sized-Candidate-Set ART (FSCS-ART) sampling strategy faces a quadratic\ntime cost, which worsens as the dimensionality of the software input domain\nincreases. In this paper, we propose an approach based on small world graphs\nthat can enhance the computational efficiency of FSCS-ART: SWFC-ART. To\nefficiently perform nearest neighbor queries for candidate test cases, SWFC-ART\nincrementally constructs a hierarchical navigable small world graph for\npreviously executed, non-failure-causing test cases.

To address this problem, the publicly\navailable thematic products are often used for annotating RS images with\nzero-labeling cost. However, in this case the training set can include noisy\nmulti-labels that distort the learning process, resulting in inaccurate\npredictions. This paper proposes an architect-independent Consensual\nCollaborative Multi-Label Learning (CCML) method to train deep classifiers\nunder input-dependent (heteroscedastic) multi-label noise in the MLC problems.\nThe proposed CCML identifies, ranks, and corrects noisy multi-label images\nthrough four main modules: 1) group lasso module; 2) discrepancy module; 3)\nflipping module; and 4) swap module. The group lasso module detects the\npotentially noisy labels by estimating the label uncertainty based on the\naggregation of two collaborative networks. The discrepancy module ensures that\nthe two networks learn diverse features, while obtaining the same predictions.\nThe flipping module corrects the identified noisy labels, and the swap module\nexchanges the ranking information between the two networks. The experiments\nconducted on the multi-label RS image archive IR-BigEarthNet confirm the\nrobustness of the proposed CCML under extreme multi-label noise rates.",

    "abstract": "Branch coverage of source code is a very widely used test criterion.\nMoreover, branch coverage is a similar problem to line coverage, MC/DC and the\ncoverage of assertion violations, certain runtime errors and various other\ntypes of test objective. Indeed, establishing that a large number of test\nobjectives are unreachable, or conversely, providing the test inputs which\nreach them, is at the heart of many verification tasks. However, automatic test\ngeneration for exhaustive branch coverage remains an elusive goal: many modern\ntools obtain high coverage scores without being able to provide an explanation\nfor why some branches are not covered, such as a demonstration that they are\nunreachable. Concolic test generation offers the promise of exhaustive coverage\nbut covers paths more efficiently than branches. In this paper, I explain why,\nand propose different strategies to improve its performance on exhaustive\nbranch coverage. A comparison of these strategies on examples of real code\nshows promising results.",

However handling these tasks with\nlarge-scale datasets will lead to huge computation beyond resource-constrained\nclient s computation power. With the rapid development of cloud computing,\noutsourcing intensive tasks to cloud server has become a promising method.\nWhile the cloud server is generally out of the control of clients, there are\nstill many challenges concerned with the privacy security of clients sensitive\ndata. Motivated by this, Lei et al. presented an efficient encryption scheme\nbased on random permutation to protect the privacy of client s data in\noutsourcing MMC task. Nevertheless, there exists inherent security flaws in\ntheir scheme, revealing the statistic information of zero elements in the\noriginal data thus not satisfying the computational indistinguishability\n(IND-ZEA). Aiming to enhance the security of the outsourcing MMC task, we\npropose a new encryption scheme based on subtly designed invertible matrix\nwhere the additive perturbation is introduced besides the multiplicative\nperturbation. Furthermore, we show that the proposed encryption scheme can be\napplied to not only MMC task but also other kinds of outsourced tasks such as\nlinear regression and principal component analysis.

To further optimize the hardware overhead of using AdderNet,\nthis paper studies the winograd algorithm, which is a widely used fast\nalgorithm for accelerating convolution and saving the computational costs.\nUnfortunately, the conventional Winograd algorithm cannot be directly applied\nto AdderNets since the distributive law in multiplication is not valid for the\nl1-norm.

    "abstract": "In this contribution, we predict the wellhead protection area (WHPA, target),\nthe shape and extent of which is influenced by the distribution of hydraulic\nconductivity (K), from a small number of tracing experiments (predictor). Our\nfirst objective is to make stochastic predictions of the WHPA within the\nBayesian Evidential Learning (BEL) framework, which aims to find a direct\nrelationship between predictor and target using machine learning. This\nrelationship is learned from a small set of training models (400) sampled from\nthe prior distribution of K. The associated 400 pairs of simulated predictors\nand targets are obtained through forward modelling. Newly collected field data\ncan then be directly used to predict the approximate posterior distribution of\nthe corresponding WHPA. The uncertainty range of the posterior WHPA\ndistribution is affected by the number and position of data sources (injection\nwells). Our second objective is to extend BEL to identify the optimal design of\ndata source locations that minimizes the posterior uncertainty of the WHPA.\nThis can be done explicitly, without averaging or approximating because once\ntrained, the BEL model allows the computation of the posterior uncertainty\ncorresponding to any new input data. We use the Modified Hausdorff Distance and\nthe Structural Similarity index metrics to estimate the posterior uncertainty\nrange of the WHPA. Increasing the number of injection wells effectively reduces\nthe derived posterior WHPA uncertainty. Our approach can also estimate which\ninjection wells are more informative than others, as validated through a k-fold\ncross-validation procedure. Overall, the application of BEL to experimental\ndesign makes it possible to identify the data sources maximizing the\ninformation content of any measurement data.",

    "title": "Mining Legacy Issues in Open Pit Mining sites: Innovation & Support of  Renaturalization and Land Utilization",
    "abstract": "Open pit mines left many regions worldwide inhospitable or uninhabitable. To\nput these regions back into use, entire stretches of land must be\nrenaturalized. For the sustainable subsequent use or transfer to a new primary\nuse, many contaminated sites and soil information have to be permanently\nmanaged. In most cases, this information is available in the form of expert\nreports in unstructured data collections or file folders, which in the best\ncase are digitized. Due to size and complexity of the data, it is difficult for\na single person to have an overview of this data in order to be able to make\nreliable statements. This is one of the most important obstacles to the rapid\ntransfer of these areas to after-use. An information-based approach to this\nissue supports fulfilling several Sustainable Development Goals regarding\nenvironment issues, health and climate action. We use a stack of Optical\nCharacter Recognition, Text Classification, Active Learning and Geographic\nInformation System Visualization to effectively mine and visualize this\ninformation. Subsequently, we link the extracted information to geographic\ncoordinates and visualize them using a Geographic Information System. Active\nLearning plays a vital role because our dataset provides no training data. In\ntotal, we process nine categories and actively learn their representation in\nour dataset. We evaluate the OCR, Active Learning and Text Classification\nseparately to report the performance of the system. Active Learning and text\nclassification results are twofold: Whereas our categories about restrictions\nwork sufficient ($>$.85 F1), the seven topic-oriented categories were\ncomplicated for human coders and hence the results achieved mediocre evaluation\nscores ($<$.70 F1).",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks will always make a prediction, even when\ncompletely uncertain and regardless of the consequences. This obliviousness of\nuncertainty is a major obstacle towards their adoption in practice. Techniques\nexist, however, to estimate the two major types of uncertainty: model\nuncertainty and observation noise in the data. Bayesian neural networks are\ntheoretically well-founded models that can learn the model uncertainty of their\npredictions. Minor modifications to these models and their loss functions allow\nlearning the observation noise for individual samples as well. This paper is\nthe first to apply these techniques to predictive process monitoring. We found\nthat they contribute towards more accurate predictions and work quickly.\nHowever, their main benefit resides with the uncertainty estimates themselves\nthat allow the separation of higher-quality from lower-quality predictions and\nthe building of confidence intervals. This leads to many interesting\napplications, enables an earlier adoption of prediction systems with smaller\ndatasets and fosters a better cooperation with humans.",

    "abstract": "Virtual assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Home, and\nMicrosoft's Cortana, are becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives and\nsuccessfully help users in various daily tasks, such as making phone calls or\nplaying music. Yet, they still struggle with playful utterances, which are not\nmeant to be interpreted literally. Examples include jokes or absurd requests or\nquestions such as, \"Are you afraid of the dark?\", \"Who let the dogs out?\", or\n\"Order a zillion gummy bears\". Today, virtual assistants often return\nirrelevant answers to such utterances, except for hard-coded ones addressed by\ncanned replies.\nTo address the challenge of automatically detecting playful utterances, we\nfirst characterize the different types of playful human-virtual assistant\ninteraction. We introduce a taxonomy of playful requests rooted in theories of\nhumor and refined by analyzing real-world traffic from Alexa. We then focus on\none node, personification, where users refer to the virtual assistant as a\nperson (\"What do you do for fun?\"). Our conjecture is that understanding such\nutterances will improve user experience with virtual assistants. We conducted a\nWizard-of-Oz user study and showed that endowing virtual assistant s with the\nability to identify humorous opportunities indeed has the potential to increase\nuser satisfaction. We hope this work will contribute to the understanding of\nthe landscape of the problem and inspire novel ideas and techniques towards the\nvision of giving virtual assistants a sense of humor.",

It now features QoS-configurable communication and a flexible layered\narchitecture. Micro-ROS is a variant developed specifically for\nresource-constrained microcontrollers (MCU). Such MCUs are commonly used in\nrobotics for sensors and actuators, for time-critical control functions, and\nfor safety. While the execution management of ROS 2 has been addressed by an\nExecutor concept, its lack of real-time capabilities make it unsuitable for\nindustrial use. Neither defining an execution order nor the assignment of\nscheduling parameters to tasks is possible, despite the fact that advanced\nreal-time scheduling algorithms are well-known and available in modern RTOS's.\nFor example, the NuttX RTOS supports a variant of the reservation-based\nscheduling which is very attractive for industrial applications: It allows to\nassign execution time budgets to software components so that a system\nintegrator can thereby guarantee the real-time requirements of the entire\nsystem. This paper presents for the first time a ROS~2 Executor design which\nenables the real-time scheduling capabilities of the operating system.

We describe a\nmodel in which meaningful scene structures are extracted from the image by an\niterative process, combining bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) networks,\ninteracting through a symmetric bi-directional communication between them\n(counter-streams structure). The model constructs a scene representation by the\niterative use of three components. The first model component is a BU stream\nthat extracts selected scene elements, properties and relations. The second\ncomponent (cognitive augmentation) augments the extracted visual representation\nbased on relevant non-visual stored representations. It also provides input to\nthe third component, the TD stream, in the form of a TD instruction,\ninstructing the model what task to perform next. The TD stream then guides the\nBU visual stream to perform the selected task in the next cycle. During this\nprocess, the visual representations extracted from the image can be combined\nwith relevant non-visual representations, so that the final scene\nrepresentation is based on both visual information extracted from the scene and\nrelevant stored knowledge of the world. We describe how a sequence of\nTD-instructions is used to extract from the scene structures of interest,\nincluding an algorithm to automatically select the next TD-instruction in the\nsequence.

It learns the KG embeddings via entity mappings from a\nprobabilistic reasoning system named PARIS, and feeds the resultant entity\nmappings and embeddings back into PARIS for augmentation. The PRASE framework\nis compatible with different embedding-based models, and our experiments on\nmultiple datasets have demonstrated its state-of-the-art performance.",

    "title": "ROSEFusion: Random Optimization for Online Dense Reconstruction under  Fast Camera Motion",
    "abstract": "Online reconstruction based on RGB-D sequences has thus far been restrained\nto relatively slow camera motions (<1m/s). Under very fast camera motion (e.g.,\n3m/s), the reconstruction can easily crumble even for the state-of-the-art\nmethods. Fast motion brings two challenges to depth fusion: 1) the high\nnonlinearity of camera pose optimization due to large inter-frame rotations and\n2) the lack of reliably trackable features due to motion blur. We propose to\ntackle the difficulties of fast-motion camera tracking in the absence of\ninertial measurements using random optimization, in particular, the Particle\nFilter Optimization (PFO). To surmount the computation-intensive particle\nsampling and update in standard PFO, we propose to accelerate the randomized\nsearch via updating a particle swarm template (PST). PST is a set of particles\npre-sampled uniformly within the unit sphere in the 6D space of camera pose.\nThrough moving and rescaling the pre-sampled PST guided by swarm intelligence,\nour method is able to drive tens of thousands of particles to locate and cover\na good local optimum extremely fast and robustly. The particles, representing\ncandidate poses, are evaluated with a fitness function defined based on\ndepth-model conformance. Therefore, our method, being depth-only and\ncorrespondence-free, mitigates the motion blur impediment as ToF-based depths\nare often resilient to motion blur. Thanks to the efficient template-based\nparticle set evolution and the effective fitness function, our method attains\ngood quality pose tracking under fast camera motion (up to 4m/s) in a realtime\nframerate without including loop closure or global pose optimization. Through\nextensive evaluations on public datasets of RGB-D sequences, especially on a\nnewly proposed benchmark of fast camera motion, we demonstrate the significant\nadvantage of our method over the state of the arts.",

This simplicity bias can explain their lack of robustness out of\ndistribution (OOD). The more complex the task to learn, the more likely it is\nthat statistical artifacts (i.e. selection biases, spurious correlations) are\nsimpler than the mechanisms to learn.\nWe demonstrate that the simplicity bias can be mitigated and OOD\ngeneralization improved. We train a set of similar models to fit the data in\ndifferent ways using a penalty on the alignment of their input gradients. We\nshow theoretically and empirically that this induces the learning of more\ncomplex predictive patterns.\nOOD generalization fundamentally requires information beyond i.i.d. examples,\nsuch as multiple training environments, counterfactual examples, or other side\ninformation. Our approach shows that we can defer this requirement to an\nindependent model selection stage. We obtain SOTA results in visual recognition\non biased data and generalization across visual domains.

Existing public databases such\nas MEDLINE contain over 27 million articles, making it difficult to extract\nrelevant content without the use of efficient search engines. Information\nretrieval tools are crucial in order to navigate and provide meaningful\nrecommendations for articles and treatments. Classifying these articles into\nbroader medical topics can improve the retrieval of related articles. The set\nof medical labels considered for the MESINESP task is on the order of several\nthousands of labels (DeCS codes), which falls under the extreme multi-label\nclassification problem. The heterogeneous and highly hierarchical structure of\nmedical topics makes the task of manually classifying articles extremely\nlaborious and costly. It is, therefore, crucial to automate the process of\nclassification. Typical machine learning algorithms become computationally\ndemanding with such a large number of labels and achieving better recall on\nsuch datasets becomes an unsolved problem.\nThis work presents Priberam's participation at the BioASQ task Mesinesp.

Most of\nthese methods work based on two major assumptions: 1) there are the same number\nof homogeneous data samples in each modality, and 2) at least partial\ncorrespondences between modalities are given in advance as prior knowledge.\nThis work proposes two new multimodal modeling methods. The first method\nestablishes a general analyzing framework to deal with the multimodal\ninformation problem for heterogeneous data without any specific prior\nknowledge.

The second method is a manifold regularized multimodal\nclassification based on pointwise correspondences (M$^2$CPC) used for the\nproblem of multiclass classification of multimodal heterogeneous, which the\ncorrespondences between modalities are determined based on the FMBSD method.\nThe experimental results of evaluating the FMBSD method on three common\ncross-modal retrieval datasets and evaluating the (M$^2$CPC) method on three\nbenchmark multimodal multiclass classification datasets indicate their\neffectiveness and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.",

We build on the\nrecent Vision Transformer (ViT) and extend it to semantic segmentation. To do\nso, we rely on the output embeddings corresponding to image patches and obtain\nclass labels from these embeddings with a point-wise linear decoder or a mask\ntransformer decoder.

The linear decoder allows to obtain excellent results\nalready, but the performance can be further improved by a mask transformer\ngenerating class masks. We conduct an extensive ablation study to show the\nimpact of the different parameters, in particular the performance is better for\nlarge models and small patch sizes.

    "title": "VL-NMS: Breaking Proposal Bottlenecks in Two-Stage Visual-Language  Matching",
    "abstract": "The prevailing framework for matching multimodal inputs is based on a\ntwo-stage process: 1) detecting proposals with an object detector and 2)\nmatching text queries with proposals. Existing two-stage solutions mostly focus\non the matching step. In this paper, we argue that these methods overlook an\nobvious \\emph{mismatch} between the roles of proposals in the two stages: they\ngenerate proposals solely based on the detection confidence (i.e.,\nquery-agnostic), hoping that the proposals contain all instances mentioned in\nthe text query (i.e., query-aware). Due to this mismatch, chances are that\nproposals relevant to the text query are suppressed during the filtering\nprocess, which in turn bounds the matching performance. To this end, we propose\nVL-NMS, which is the first method to yield query-aware proposals at the first\nstage. VL-NMS regards all mentioned instances as critical objects, and\nintroduces a lightweight module to predict a score for aligning each proposal\nwith a critical object. These scores can guide the NMS operation to filter out\nproposals irrelevant to the text query, increasing the recall of critical\nobjects, resulting in a significantly improved matching performance. Since\nVL-NMS is agnostic to the matching step, it can be easily integrated into any\nstate-of-the-art two-stage matching methods. We validate the effectiveness of\nVL-NMS on two multimodal matching tasks, namely referring expression grounding\nand image-text matching. Extensive ablation studies on several baselines and\nbenchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of VL-NMS.",

    "abstract": "We provide a formal definition for a class of algorithms known as \"particle\nmethods\". Particle methods are used in scientific computing. They include\npopular simulation methods, such as Discrete Element Methods (DEM), Molecular\nDynamics (MD), Particle Strength Exchange (PSE), and Smoothed Particle\nHydrodynamics (SPH), but also particle-based image processing methods,\npoint-based computer graphics, and computational optimization algorithms using\npoint samples. All of these rest on a common concept, which we here formally\ndefine. The presented definition of particle methods makes it possible to\ndistinguish what formally constitutes a particle method, and what not. It also\nenables us to define different sub-classes of particle methods that differ with\nrespect to their computational complexity and power. Our definition is purely\nformal, independent of any application. After stating the definition, we\ntherefore illustrate how several well-known particle methods can be formalized\nin our framework, and we show how the formal definition can be used to\nformulate novel particle methods for non-canonical problems.",

    "abstract": "Since neural networks are data-hungry, incorporating data augmentation in\ntraining is a widely adopted technique that enlarges datasets and improves\ngeneralization. On the other hand, aggregating predictions of multiple\naugmented samples (i.e., test-time augmentation) could boost performance even\nfurther. In the context of person re-identification models, it is common\npractice to extract embeddings for both the original images and their\nhorizontally flipped variants. The final representation is the mean of the\naforementioned feature vectors. However, such scheme results in a gap between\ntraining and inference, i.e., the mean feature vectors calculated in inference\nare not part of the training pipeline. In this study, we devise the FlipReID\nstructure with the flipping loss to address this issue. More specifically,\nmodels using the FlipReID structure are trained on the original images and the\nflipped images simultaneously, and incorporating the flipping loss minimizes\nthe mean squared error between feature vectors of corresponding image pairs.\nExtensive experiments show that our method brings consistent improvements. In\nparticular, we set a new record for MSMT17 which is the largest person\nre-identification dataset. The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/nixingyang/FlipReID.",

However, we experimentally find that deformable\nalignment methods still suffer from fast motion due to locally loss-driven\noffset prediction and lack explicit motion constraints. Hence, we propose a\nMatching-based Flow Estimation (MFE) module to conduct global semantic feature\nmatching and estimate optical flow as coarse offset for each location. And a\nFlow-guided Deformable Module (FDM) is proposed to integrate optical flow into\ndeformable convolution. The FDM uses the optical flow to warp the neighboring\nframes at first. And then, the warped neighboring frames and the reference one\nare used to predict a set of fine offsets for each coarse offset. In general,\nwe propose an end-to-end deep network called Flow-guided Deformable Alignment\nNetwork (FDAN), which reaches the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark\ndatasets while is still competitive in computation and memory consumption.",

For this, we train a direct\npose estimator in a class-agnostic way by sharing weights across all object\nclasses, and we introduce a contrastive learning method that has three main\ningredients: (i) the use of pre-trained, self-supervised, contrast-based\nfeatures; (ii) pose-aware data augmentations; (iii) a pose-aware contrastive\nloss.

    "abstract": "XGBoost is one of the most widely used machine learning models in the\nindustry due to its superior learning accuracy and efficiency. Targeting at\ndata isolation issues in the big data problems, it is crucial to deploy a\nsecure and efficient federated XGBoost (FedXGB) model. Existing FedXGB models\neither have data leakage issues or are only applicable to the two-party setting\nwith heavy communication and computation overheads. In this paper, a lossless\nmulti-party federated XGB learning framework is proposed with a security\nguarantee, which reshapes the XGBoost's split criterion calculation process\nunder a secret sharing setting and solves the leaf weight calculation problem\nby leveraging distributed optimization. Remarkably, a thorough analysis of\nmodel security is provided as well, and multiple numerical results showcase the\nsuperiority of the proposed FedXGB compared with the state-of-the-art models on\nbenchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Modern deep learning workloads run on distributed hardware and are difficult\nto optimize -- data, model, and pipeline parallelism require a developer to\nthoughtfully restructure their workload around optimized computation and\ncommunication kernels in libraries such as cuBLAS and NCCL. The logical\nseparation between computation and communication leaves performance on the\ntable with missed optimization opportunities across abstraction boundaries. To\nexplore these opportunities, this paper presents CoCoNet, which consists of a\ncompute language to express programs with both computation and communication, a\nscheduling language to apply transformations on such programs, and a compiler\nto generate high performance kernels. Providing both computation and\ncommunication as first class constructs enables new optimizations, such as\noverlapping or fusion of communication with computation. CoCoNet allowed us to\noptimize several data, model and pipeline parallel workloads in existing deep\nlearning systems with very few lines of code. We show significant improvements\nafter integrating novel CoCoNet generated kernels.",

Because autoencoders do not possess such a process of\nnormalization, they often fail to recognize outliers even when they are\nobviously OOD. We propose the Normalized Autoencoder (NAE), a normalized\nprobabilistic model constructed from an autoencoder. The probability density of\nNAE is defined using the reconstruction error of an autoencoder, which is\ndifferently defined in the conventional energy-based model. In our model,\nnormalization is enforced by suppressing the reconstruction of negative\nsamples, significantly improving the outlier detection performance.

But ST encoders are\nnot simple instances of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Machine\nTranslation (MT) encoders. For example, we find ASR encoders lack the global\ncontext representation, which is necessary for translation, whereas MT encoders\nare not designed to deal with long but locally attentive acoustic sequences. In\nthis work, we propose a Stacked Acoustic-and-Textual Encoding (SATE) method for\nspeech translation. Our encoder begins with processing the acoustic sequence as\nusual, but later behaves more like an MT encoder for a global representation of\nthe input sequence. In this way, it is straightforward to incorporate the\npre-trained models into the system. Also, we develop an adaptor module to\nalleviate the representation inconsistency between the pre-trained ASR encoder\nand MT encoder, and a multi-teacher knowledge distillation method to preserve\nthe pre-training knowledge. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech En-Fr and\nMuST-C En-De show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance of\n18.3 and 25.2 BLEU points.

    "title": "Exploring the Similarity of Representations in Model-Agnostic  Meta-Learning",
    "abstract": "In past years model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has been one of the most\npromising approaches in meta-learning. It can be applied to different kinds of\nproblems, e.g., reinforcement learning, but also shows good results on few-shot\nlearning tasks. Besides their tremendous success in these tasks, it has still\nnot been fully revealed yet, why it works so well. Recent work proposes that\nMAML rather reuses features than rapidly learns. In this paper, we want to\ninspire a deeper understanding of this question by analyzing MAML's\nrepresentation. We apply representation similarity analysis (RSA), a\nwell-established method in neuroscience, to the few-shot learning instantiation\nof MAML. Although some part of our analysis supports their general results that\nfeature reuse is predominant, we also reveal arguments against their\nconclusion. The similarity-increase of layers closer to the input layers arises\nfrom the learning task itself and not from the model. In addition, the\nrepresentations after inner gradient steps make a broader change to the\nrepresentation than the changes during meta-training.",

    "abstract": "Drug repurposing can accelerate the identification of effective compounds for\nclinical use against SARS-CoV-2, with the advantage of pre-existing clinical\nsafety data and an established supply chain. RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2\nmanipulate cellular pathways and induce reorganization of subcellular\nstructures to support their life cycle. These morphological changes can be\nquantified using bioimaging techniques. In this work, we developed DEEMD: a\ncomputational pipeline using deep neural network models within a multiple\ninstance learning (MIL) framework, to identify putative treatments effective\nagainst SARS-CoV-2 based on morphological analysis of the publicly available\nRxRx19a dataset. This dataset consists of fluorescence microscopy images of\nSARS-CoV-2 non-infected cells and infected cells, with and without drug\ntreatment. DEEMD first extracts discriminative morphological features to\ngenerate cell morphological profiles from the non-infected and infected cells.\nThese morphological profiles are then used in a statistical model to estimate\nthe applied treatment efficacy on infected cells based on similarities to\nnon-infected cells. DEEMD is capable of localizing infected cells via weak\nsupervision without any expensive pixel-level annotations. DEEMD identifies\nknown SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, such as Remdesivir and Aloxistatin, supporting the\nvalidity of our approach.

These\ntechniques crucially rely on accurate estimation of pairwise distance between\nrecords. However, computing exact features of the records, and their pairwise\ndistances is often challenging, and sometimes not possible. We circumvent this\nchallenge by leveraging weak supervision in the form of a comparison oracle\nthat compares the relative distance between the queried points such as `Is\npoint u closer to v or w closer to x?'.\nHowever, it is possible that some queries are easier to answer than others\nusing a comparison oracle. We capture this by introducing two different noise\nmodels called adversarial and probabilistic noise. In this paper, we study\nvarious problems that include finding maximum, nearest/farthest neighbor search\nunder these noise models. Building upon the techniques we develop for these\ncomparison operations, we give robust algorithms for k-center clustering and\nagglomerative hierarchical clustering.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of Private Information Retrieval with Private Side\nInformation (PIR-PSI), wherein a user wants to retrieve a file from replication\nbased non-colluding databases by using the prior knowledge of a subset of the\nfiles stored on the databases. The PIR-PSI framework ensures that the privacy\nof the demand and the side information are jointly preserved, thereby finding\npotential applications when multiple files have to be downloaded spread across\ndifferent time-instants. Although the capacity of the PIR-PSI setting is known,\nwe observe that the underlying capacity achieving code construction uses\nMaximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes thereby contributing to high\ncomputational complexity when retrieving the demand. Pointing at this drawback\nof MDS-based PIR-PSI codes, we propose XOR-based PIR-PSI codes for a simple yet\nnon-trivial setting of two non-colluding databases and two side information\nfiles at the user. While our codes offer substantial reduction in complexity\nwhen compared to MDS based codes, the code-rate marginally falls short of the\ncapacity of the PIR-PSI setting. Nevertheless, we show that our code-rate is\nstrictly higher than that of XOR-based codes for PIR with no side information,\nthereby implying that our codes can be useful when downloading multiple files\nin a sequential manner, instead of applying XOR-based PIR codes on each file.",

The\nTolerance Principle is a recent proposal that provides a precise threshold of\nexceptions that a productive rule can withstand. Its empirical application so\nfar, however, requires the researcher to fully specify rules defined over a set\nof words. We propose a greedy search model that automatically hypothesizes\nrules and evaluates their productivity over a vocabulary. When the search for\nbroader productivity fails, the model recursively subdivides the vocabulary and\ncontinues the search for productivity over narrower rules. Trained on\npsychologically realistic data from child-directed input, our model displays\ndevelopmental patterns observed in child morphology acquisition, including the\nnotoriously complex case of German noun pluralization.

Using three state-of-the-art datasets (PETA, PA-100K, RAP) and\nfive Person Attribute Recognition models, we correlate feature analysis with\ngender inference accuracy using the Shapley value, enabling us to perceive the\nimportance of each image/subject-based feature.

    "abstract": "Spectre vulnerabilities violate our fundamental assumptions about\narchitectural abstractions, allowing attackers to steal sensitive data despite\npreviously state-of-the-art countermeasures. To defend against Spectre,\ndevelopers of verification tools and compiler-based mitigations are forced to\nreason about microarchitectural details such as speculative execution. In order\nto aid developers with these attacks in a principled way, the research\ncommunity has sought formal foundations for speculative execution upon which to\nrebuild provable security guarantees.\nThis paper systematizes the community's current knowledge about software\nverification and mitigation for Spectre. We study state-of-the-art software\ndefenses, both with and without associated formal models, and use a cohesive\nframework to compare the security properties each defense provides. We explore\na wide variety of tradeoffs in the complexity of formal frameworks, the\nperformance of defense tools, and the resulting security guarantees. As a\nresult of our analysis, we suggest practical choices for developers of analysis\nand mitigation tools, and we identify several open problems in this area to\nguide future work on grounded software defenses.",

    "abstract": "Solving the road congestion problem is one of the most pressing issues in\nmoderncities since it causes time wasting, pollution, higher industrial costs\nand huge roadmaintenance costs. Advances in ITS technologies and the advent of\nautonomousvehicles are changing mobility dramatically. They enable the\nimplementation of acoordination mechanism, called coordinated traffic\nassignment, among the sat-navdevices aiming at assigning paths to drivers to\neliminate congestion and to re-duce the total travel time in traffic networks.\nAmong possible congestion avoidance methods, coordinated traffic assignment is\na valuable choice since it does not involvehuge investments to expand the road\nnetwork. Traffic assignments are traditionally devoted to two main perspectives\non which the well-known Wardropian principlesare inspired: the user equilibrium\nand the system optimum. User equilibrium is a user-driven traffic assignment in\nwhich each user chooses the most convenientpath selfishly. It guarantees that\nfairness among users is respected since, whenthe equilibrium is reached, all\nusers sharing the same origin and destination willexperience the same travel\ntime. The main drawback in a user equilibrium is thatthe system total travel\ntime is not minimized and, hence, the so-called Price ofAnarchy is paid. On the\nother hand, the system optimum is an efficient system-wide traffic assignment\nin which drivers are routed on the network in such a waythe total travel time\nis minimized but users might experience travel times that arehigher than the\nother users travelling from the same origin to the same destina-tion affecting\nthe compliance. Thus, drawbacks in implementing one of the two assignments can\nbe overcome by hybridizing the two approaches aiming at bridging users'\nfairness to system-wide efficiency.

    "abstract": "In recent years methods from optimal linear experimental design have been\nleveraged to obtain state of the art results for linear bandits. A design\nreturned from an objective such as $G$-optimal design is actually a probability\ndistribution over a pool of potential measurement vectors. Consequently, one\nnuisance of the approach is the task of converting this continuous probability\ndistribution into a discrete assignment of $N$ measurements. While\nsophisticated rounding techniques have been proposed, in $d$ dimensions they\nrequire $N$ to be at least $d$, $d \\log(\\log(d))$, or $d^2$ based on the\nsub-optimality of the solution. In this paper we are interested in settings\nwhere $N$ may be much less than $d$, such as in experimental design in an RKHS\nwhere $d$ may be effectively infinite. In this work, we propose a rounding\nprocedure that frees $N$ of any dependence on the dimension $d$, while\nachieving nearly the same performance guarantees of existing rounding\nprocedures. We evaluate the procedure against a baseline that projects the\nproblem to a lower dimensional space and performs rounding which requires $N$\nto just be at least a notion of the effective dimension. We also leverage our\nnew approach in a new algorithm for kernelized bandits to obtain state of the\nart results for regret minimization and pure exploration. An advantage of our\napproach over existing UCB-like approaches is that our kernel bandit algorithms\nare also robust to model misspecification.",

In SPIR, a user retrieves a message out of\n$K$ messages from $N$ non-colluding and replicated databases in such a way that\nno single database knows the retrieved message index (user privacy), and the\nuser gets to know nothing further than the retrieved message (database\nprivacy). SPIR has a capacity smaller than the PIR capacity which requires only\nuser privacy, is infeasible in the case of a single database, and requires\nshared common randomness among the databases. We introduce a new variant of\nSPIR where the user is provided with a random subset of the shared database\ncommon randomness, which is unknown to the databases. We determine the exact\ncapacity region of the triple $(d, \\rho_S, \\rho_U)$, where $d$ is the download\ncost, $\\rho_S$ is the amount of shared database (server) common randomness, and\n$\\rho_U$ is the amount of available user-side common randomness.

Unlike previous approaches to this\nand related problems our starting point is a regularized least squares\nformulation in a continuous infinite-dimensional setting that is based on\nstable variational time-space formulations of the parabolic PDE. This allows us\nto derive a priori as well as a posteriori error bounds for the recovered\nstates with respect to a certain reference solution. In these bounds the\nregularization parameter is disentangled from the underlying discretization. An\nimportant ingredient for the derivation of a posteriori bounds is the\nconstruction of suitable Fortin operators which allow us to control oscillation\nerrors stemming from the discretization of dual norms. Moreover, the\nvariational framework allows us to contrive preconditioners for the discrete\nproblems whose application can be performed in linear time, and for which the\ncondition numbers of the preconditioned systems are uniformly proportional to\nthat of the regularized continuous problem.\nIn particular, we provide suitable stopping criteria for the iterative\nsolvers based on the a posteriori error bounds.

In this paper, we present a fully convolutional\nmethod, which is simpler and more coherent to the inference process. While\ndirectly applying fully convolutional training results in model collapse, we\nstudy the underline reason behind this collapse phenomenon, indicating that the\nabsolute positions of pixels provide a shortcut to easily accomplish\ncycle-consistence, which hinders the learning of meaningful visual\nrepresentations. To break this absolute position shortcut, we propose to apply\ndifferent crops for forward and backward frames, and adopt feature warping to\nestablish correspondence between two crops of a same frame. The former\ntechnique enforces the corresponding pixels at forward and back tracks to have\ndifferent absolute positions, and the latter effectively blocks the shortcuts\ngoing between forward and back tracks.

Here, we present a parametric, context-sensitive grammar\ndesigned specifically for the representation and generation of polymers. As a\ndemonstrative example, we implement our grammar for polyurethanes.

By offering a complete,\nexplicit representation scheme and an explainable generative model with\nvalidity guarantees, our PolyGrammar takes an important step toward a more\ncomprehensive and practical system for polymer discovery and exploration.

In\nparticular, we use an orthogonal polynomial approach to derive an exact\nexpression for the probability density function of\n$\\kappa_{\\text{SC}}^2(\\mathbf{X})$ which is amenable to asymptotic analysis as\nmatrix dimensions grow large. Our asymptotic results reveal that, as\n$m,n\\to\\infty$ such that $m-n$ is fixed and when $\\eta$ scales on the order of\n$1/n$, $\\kappa_{\\text{SC}}^2(\\mathbf{X})$ scales on the order of $n^3$. In this\nrespect we establish simple closed-form expressions for the limiting\ndistributions.",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become increasingly powerful,\ngenerating mind-blowing photorealistic images that mimic the content of\ndatasets they were trained to replicate. One recurrent theme in medical imaging\nis whether GANs can also be effective at generating workable medical data as\nthey are for generating realistic RGB images. In this paper, we perform a\nmulti-GAN and multi-application study to gauge the benefits of GANs in medical\nimaging. We tested various GAN architectures from basic DCGAN to more\nsophisticated style-based GANs on three medical imaging modalities and organs\nnamely : cardiac cine-MRI, liver CT and RGB retina images. GANs were trained on\nwell-known and widely utilized datasets from which their FID score were\ncomputed to measure the visual acuity of their generated images. We further\ntested their usefulness by measuring the segmentation accuracy of a U-Net\ntrained on these generated images.\nResults reveal that GANs are far from being equal as some are ill-suited for\nmedical imaging applications while others are much better off. The\ntop-performing GANs are capable of generating realistic-looking medical images\nby FID standards that can fool trained experts in a visual Turing test and\ncomply to some metrics. However, segmentation results suggests that no GAN is\ncapable of reproducing the full richness of a medical datasets.",

In this primitive, a\nreceiver in possession of a quantum ciphertext can generate a classical\ncertificate that the encrypted message is deleted. Although their construction\nis information-theoretically secure, it is limited to the setting of one-time\nsymmetric key encryption (SKE), where a sender and receiver have to share a\ncommon key in advance and the key can be used only once. Moreover, the sender\nhas to generate a quantum state and send it to the receiver over a quantum\nchannel in their construction. Although deletion certificates are privately\nverifiable, which means a verification key for a certificate has to be kept\nsecret, in the definition by Broadbent and Islam, we can also consider public\nverifiability.\nIn this work, we present various constructions of encryption with certified\ndeletion.\n- Quantum communication case: We achieve (reusable-key) public key encryption\n(PKE) and attribute-based encryption (ABE) with certified deletion. Our PKE\nscheme with certified deletion is constructed assuming the existence of IND-CPA\nsecure PKE, and our ABE scheme with certified deletion is constructed assuming\nthe existence of indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way function. These\ntwo schemes are privately verifiable.\n- Classical communication case: We also achieve PKE with certified deletion\nthat uses only classical communication.

Especially, the deep neural networks\nbased on U-shaped architecture and skip-connections have been widely applied in\na variety of medical image tasks. However, although CNN has achieved excellent\nperformance, it cannot learn global and long-range semantic information\ninteraction well due to the locality of the convolution operation. In this\npaper, we propose Swin-Unet, which is an Unet-like pure Transformer for medical\nimage segmentation. The tokenized image patches are fed into the\nTransformer-based U-shaped Encoder-Decoder architecture with skip-connections\nfor local-global semantic feature learning.

And a symmetric Swin Transformer-based decoder with patch expanding\nlayer is designed to perform the up-sampling operation to restore the spatial\nresolution of the feature maps. Under the direct down-sampling and up-sampling\nof the inputs and outputs by 4x, experiments on multi-organ and cardiac\nsegmentation tasks demonstrate that the pure Transformer-based U-shaped\nEncoder-Decoder network outperforms those methods with full-convolution or the\ncombination of transformer and convolution.

    "abstract": "Vignetting is an inherited imaging phenomenon within almost all optical\nsystems, showing as a radial intensity darkening toward the corners of an\nimage. Since it is a common effect for photography and usually appears as a\nslight intensity variation, people usually regard it as a part of a photo and\nwould not even want to post-process it. Due to this natural advantage, in this\nwork, we study vignetting from a new viewpoint, i.e., adversarial vignetting\nattack (AVA), which aims to embed intentionally misleading information into\nvignetting and produce a natural adversarial example without noise patterns.\nThis example can fool the state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) but is imperceptible to humans. To this end, we first propose the\nradial-isotropic adversarial vignetting attack (RI-AVA) based on the physical\nmodel of vignetting, where the physical parameters (e.g., illumination factor\nand focal length) are tuned through the guidance of target CNN models. To\nachieve higher transferability across different CNNs, we further propose\nradial-anisotropic adversarial vignetting attack (RA-AVA) by allowing the\neffective regions of vignetting to be radial-anisotropic and shape-free.\nMoreover, we propose the geometry-aware level-set optimization method to solve\nthe adversarial vignetting regions and physical parameters jointly. We validate\nthe proposed methods on three popular datasets, i.e., DEV, CIFAR10, and Tiny\nImageNet, by attacking four CNNs, e.g., ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet121,\nand MobileNet-V2, demonstrating the advantages of our methods over baseline\nmethods on both transferability and image quality.",

In this paper we investigate capacity measures of two closely\nrelated QML models called explicit and implicit quantum linear classifiers\n(also called the quantum variational method and quantum kernel estimator) with\nthe objective of identifying new ways to implement structural risk minimization\n-- i.e., how to balance between training accuracy and generalization\nperformance.

Specifically, we\nshow that there exists datasets that require a high-rank observable for correct\nclassification, and that there exists datasets that can only be classified with\na given margin using an observable of at least a certain Frobenius norm.

    "title": "Joint Routing and Charging Problem of Multiple Electric Vehicles: A Fast  Optimization Algorithm",
    "abstract": "Logistics has gained great attentions with the prosperous development of\ncommerce, which is often seen as the classic optimal vehicle routing problem.\nMeanwhile, electric vehicle (EV) has been widely used in logistic fleet to curb\nthe emission of green house gases in recent years. Solving the optimization\nproblem of joint routing and charging of multiple EVs is in a urgent need,\nwhose objective function includes charging time, charging cost, EVs travel\ntime, usage fees of EV and revenue from serving customers. This joint problem\nis formulated as a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem, which, however, is\nNP-hard due to integer restrictions and bilinear terms from the coupling\nbetween routing and charging decisions. The main contribution of this paper\nlies at proposing an efficient two stage algorithm that can decompose the\noriginal MIP problem into two linear programming (LP) problems, by exploiting\nthe exactness of LP relaxation and eliminating the coupled term. This algorithm\ncan achieve a nearoptimal solution in polynomial time. In addition, another\nvariant algorithm is proposed based on the two stage one, to further improve\nthe quality of solution.",

    "title": "Linking Physical Objects to Their Digital Twins via Fiducial Markers  Designed for Invisibility to Humans",
    "abstract": "The ability to label and track physical objects that are assets in digital\nrepresentations of the world is foundational to many complex systems. Simple,\nyet powerful methods such as bar- and QR-codes have been highly successful,\ne.g. in the retail space, but the lack of security, limited information content\nand impossibility of seamless integration with the environment have prevented a\nlarge-scale linking of physical objects to their digital twins. This paper\nproposes to link digital assets created through BIM with their physical\ncounterparts using fiducial markers with patterns defined by Cholesteric\nSpherical Reflectors (CSRs), selective retroreflectors produced using liquid\ncrystal self-assembly. The markers leverage the ability of CSRs to encode\ninformation that is easily detected and read with computer vision while\nremaining practically invisible to the human eye. We analyze the potential of a\nCSR-based infrastructure from the perspective of BIM, critically reviewing the\noutstanding challenges in applying this new class of functional materials, and\nwe discuss extended opportunities arising in assisting autonomous mobile robots\nto reliably navigate human-populated environments, as well as in augmented\nreality.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of the on-chip micro-polarizer technology has made it\npossible to acquire four spatially aligned and temporally synchronized\npolarization images with the same ease of operation as a conventional camera.\nIn this paper, we investigate the use of this sensor technology in\nhigh-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging. Specifically, observing that natural light\ncan be attenuated differently by varying the orientation of the polarization\nfilter, we treat the multiple images captured by the polarization camera as a\nset captured under different exposure times. In our approach, we first study\nthe relationship among polarizer orientation, degree and angle of polarization\nof light to the exposure time of a pixel in the polarization image.\nSubsequently, we propose a deep snapshot HDR reconstruction framework to\nrecover an HDR image using the polarization images. A polarized HDR dataset is\ncreated to train and evaluate our approach. We demonstrate that our approach\nperforms favorably against state-of-the-art HDR reconstruction algorithms.",

    "title": "20-fold Accelerated 7T fMRI Using Referenceless Self-Supervised Deep  Learning Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "High spatial and temporal resolution across the whole brain is essential to\naccurately resolve neural activities in fMRI. Therefore, accelerated imaging\ntechniques target improved coverage with high spatio-temporal resolution.\nSimultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging combined with in-plane acceleration are\nused in large studies that involve ultrahigh field fMRI, such as the Human\nConnectome Project. However, for even higher acceleration rates, these methods\ncannot be reliably utilized due to aliasing and noise artifacts. Deep learning\n(DL) reconstruction techniques have recently gained substantial interest for\nimproving highly-accelerated MRI. Supervised learning of DL reconstructions\ngenerally requires fully-sampled training datasets, which is not available for\nhigh-resolution fMRI studies. To tackle this challenge, self-supervised\nlearning has been proposed for training of DL reconstruction with only\nundersampled datasets, showing similar performance to supervised learning. In\nthis study, we utilize a self-supervised physics-guided DL reconstruction on a\n5-fold SMS and 4-fold in-plane accelerated 7T fMRI data. Our results show that\nour self-supervised DL reconstruction produce high-quality images at this\n20-fold acceleration, substantially improving on existing methods, while\nshowing similar functional precision and temporal effects in the subsequent\nanalysis compared to a standard 10-fold accelerated acquisition.",

    "abstract": "We introduce kernel thinning, a simple algorithm for generating\nbetter-than-Monte-Carlo approximations to distributions $\\mathbb{P}$ on\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$. Given $n$ input points, a suitable reproducing kernel\n$\\mathbf{k}$, and $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time, kernel thinning returns $\\sqrt{n}$\npoints with comparable integration error for every function in the associated\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space. With high probability, the maximum\ndiscrepancy in integration error is $\\mathcal{O}_d(n^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\sqrt{\\log\nn})$ for compactly supported $\\mathbb{P}$ and $\\mathcal{O}_d(n^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\sqrt{(\\log n)^{d+1}\\log\\log n})$ for sub-exponential $\\mathbb{P}$. In\ncontrast, an equal-sized i.i.d. sample from $\\mathbb{P}$ suffers\n$\\Omega(n^{-\\frac14})$ integration error. Our sub-exponential guarantees\nresemble the classical quasi-Monte Carlo error rates for uniform $\\mathbb{P}$\non $[0,1]^d$ but apply to general distributions on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and a wide\nrange of common kernels. We use our results to derive explicit non-asymptotic\nmaximum mean discrepancy bounds for Gaussian, Mat\\'ern, and B-spline kernels\nand present two vignettes illustrating the practical benefits of kernel\nthinning over i.i.d. sampling and standard Markov chain Monte Carlo thinning.",
