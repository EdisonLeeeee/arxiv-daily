    "abstract": "Microcosm, Hyper-G, and the Web were developed and released after 1989. There\nwere strengths and weaknesses associate with each of these hypertext systems.\nThe architectures of these systems were relatively different from one another.\nStanding above its competitors, the Web became the largest and most popular\ninformation system. This paper analyses the reasons for which the Web became\nthe first successful hypermedia system by looking and evaluating the\narchitecture of the Web, Hyper-G, and Microcosm systems. Three reasons will be\ngiven beyond this success with some lessons to learn. Currently, Semantic Web\nis a recent development of the Web to provide conceptual hypermedia. More\nimportantly, study of the Web with its impact on technical, socio-cultural, and\neconomical agendas is introduced as web science.",

    "abstract": "Researchers are often evaluated by citation-based metrics. Such metrics can\ninform hiring, promotion, and funding decisions. Concerns have been expressed\nthat popular citation-based metrics incentivize researchers to maximize the\nproduction of publications. Such incentives may not be optimal for scientific\nprogress. Here we present a citation-based measure that rewards both\nproductivity and taste: the researcher's ability to focus on impactful\ncontributions. The presented measure, CAP, balances the impact of publications\nand their quantity, thus incentivizing researchers to consider whether a\npublication is a useful addition to the literature. CAP is simple,\ninterpretable, and parameter-free. We analyze the characteristics of CAP for\nhighly-cited researchers in biology, computer science, economics, and physics,\nusing a corpus of millions of publications and hundreds of millions of\ncitations with yearly temporal granularity. CAP produces qualitatively\nplausible outcomes and has a number of advantages over prior metrics. Results\ncan be explored at https://cap-measure.org/",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new online learning framework for multiclass\nclassification called learning with diluted bandit feedback. At every time\nstep, the algorithm predicts a candidate label set instead of a single label\nfor the observed example. It then receives feedback from the environment\nwhether the actual label lies in this candidate label set or not. This feedback\nis called \"diluted bandit feedback\". Learning in this setting is even more\nchallenging than the bandit feedback setting, as there is more uncertainty in\nthe supervision. We propose an algorithm for multiclass classification using\ndilute bandit feedback (MC-DBF), which uses the exploration-exploitation\nstrategy to predict the candidate set in each trial. We show that the proposed\nalgorithm achieves O(T^{1-\\frac{1}{m+2}}) mistake bound if candidate label set\nsize (in each step) is m. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach with extensive simulations.",

    "title": "Automatic Fault Detection for Deep Learning Programs Using Graph  Transformations",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, we are witnessing an increasing demand in both corporates and\nacademia for exploiting Deep Learning (DL) to solve complex real-world\nproblems. A DL program encodes the network structure of a desirable DL model\nand the process by which the model learns from the training dataset. Like any\nsoftware, a DL program can be faulty, which implies substantial challenges of\nsoftware quality assurance, especially in safety-critical domains. It is\ntherefore crucial to equip DL development teams with efficient fault detection\ntechniques and tools. In this paper, we propose NeuraLint, a model-based fault\ndetection approach for DL programs, using meta-modelling and graph\ntransformations. First, we design a meta-model for DL programs that includes\ntheir base skeleton and fundamental properties. Then, we construct a\ngraph-based verification process that covers 23 rules defined on top of the\nmeta-model and implemented as graph transformations to detect faults and design\ninefficiencies in the generated models (i.e., instances of the meta-model).\nFirst, the proposed approach is evaluated by finding faults and design\ninefficiencies in 28 synthesized examples built from common problems reported\nin the literature. Then NeuraLint successfully finds 64 faults and design\ninefficiencies in 34 real-world DL programs extracted from Stack Overflow posts\nand GitHub repositories. The results show that NeuraLint effectively detects\nfaults and design issues in both synthesized and real-world examples with a\nrecall of 70.5 % and a precision of 100 %. Although the proposed meta-model is\ndesigned for feedforward neural networks, it can be extended to support other\nneural network architectures such as recurrent neural networks. Researchers can\nalso expand our set of verification rules to cover more types of issues in DL\nprograms.",

The procedure of implementing a IDS for Internet of Things (IoT)\nnetworks is not without challenges due to the variability of these systems and\nspecifically the difficulty in accessing data. The specifics of these very\nconstrained devices render the design of an IDS capable of dealing with the\nvaried attacks a very challenging problem and a very active research subject.\nIn the current state of literature, a number of approaches have been proposed\nto improve the efficiency of intrusion detection, catering to some of these\nlimitations, such as resource constraints and mobility. In this article, we\nreview works on IDS specifically for these kinds of devices from 2008 to 2018,\ncollecting a total of 51 different IDS papers. We summarise the current themes\nof the field, summarise the techniques employed to train and deploy the IDSs\nand provide a qualitative evaluations of these approaches. While these works\nprovide valuable insights and solutions for sub-parts of these constraints, we\ndiscuss the limitations of these solutions as a whole, in particular what kinds\nof attacks these approaches struggle to detect and the setup limitations that\nare unique to this kind of system.

    "abstract": "Dynamic Connectivity is a fundamental algorithmic graph problem, motivated by\na wide range of applications to social and communication networks and used as a\nbuilding block in various other algorithms, such as the bi-connectivity and the\ndynamic minimal spanning tree problems. In brief, we wish to maintain the\nconnected components of the graph under dynamic edge insertions and deletions.\nIn the sequential case, the problem has been well-studied from both theoretical\nand practical perspectives. However, much less is known about efficient\nconcurrent solutions to this problem. This is the gap we address in this paper.\nWe start from one of the classic data structures used to solve this problem,\nthe Euler Tour Tree. Our first contribution is a non-blocking single-writer\nimplementation of it. We leverage this data structure to obtain the first truly\nconcurrent generalization of dynamic connectivity, which preserves the time\ncomplexity of its sequential counterpart, but is also scalable in practice. To\nachieve this, we rely on three main techniques. The first is to ensure that\nconnectivity queries, which usually dominate real-world workloads, are\nnon-blocking. The second non-trivial technique expands the above idea by making\nall queries that do not change the connectivity structure non-blocking. The\nthird ingredient is applying fine-grained locking for updating the connected\ncomponents, which allows operations on disjoint components to occur in\nparallel.\nWe evaluate the resulting algorithm on various workloads, executing on both\nreal and synthetic graphs. The results show the efficiency of each of the\nproposed optimizations; the most efficient variant improves the performance of\na coarse-grained based implementation on realistic scenarios up to 6x on\naverage and up to 30x when connectivity queries dominate.",

While cancer is a heterogeneous complex of distinct\ndiseases, finding the potentiality of the genes related functionality to ONGO\nor TSG through computational studies can help develop drugs that target the\ndisease. This paper proposes a classification method that starts with a\npreprocessing stage to extract the feature map sets from the input 3D protein\nstructural information. The next stage is a deep convolutional neural network\nstage (DCNN) that outputs the probability of functional classification of\ngenes. We explored and tested two approaches: in Approach 1, all filtered and\ncleaned 3D-protein-structures (PDB) are pooled together, whereas in Approach 2,\nthe primary structures and their corresponding PDBs are separated according to\nthe genes' primary structural information. Following the DCNN stage, a dynamic\nprogramming-based method is used to determine the final prediction of the\nprimary structures' functionality. We validated our proposed method using the\nCOSMIC online database. For the ONGO vs TSG classification problem, the AUROC\nof the DCNN stage for Approach 1 and Approach 2 DCNN are 0.978 and 0.765,\nrespectively.

Two types of QDNs are\nstudied, one using teleportation and the other using tell-and-go (TAG) to\nexchange quantum data. Two corresponding quantum transport protocols (QTPs),\nnamed Tele-QTP and TAG-QTP, are proposed to address many unique design\nchallenges involved in reliable delivery of data qubits, and constraints\nimposed by quantum physics laws such as the no-cloning theorem, and limited\navailability of quantum memory.\nThe proposed Tele-QTP and TAG-QTP are the first transport layer protocols for\nQDNs, complementing other works on the network protocol stack. Tele-QTP and\nTAG-QTP have novel mechanisms to support congestion-free and reliable delivery\nof streams of data qubits by managing the limited quantum memory at end hosts\nas well as intermediate nodes.

We\nbelieve that past game history plays a vital role in such a learning procedure,\nand therefore we propose a novel framework (named, F3) to fuse the past and\ncurrent game history with an Opponent Action Estimator (OAE) module that uses\npast game history to estimate the opponent's future behaviors. The experiments\nshow that the agent trained by F3 can quickly defeat opponents who adopt\nunknown new strategies.

By introducing R\\'enyi\ndivergence into the existing PIR problem, the tradeoff relationship between\nprivacy (information leakage) and PIR performance (download cost) is\ncharacterized via convex optimization. Furthermore, we propose an alternative\nPIR scheme with smaller message sizes than the Tian-Sun-Chen (TSC) scheme.

We also propose new approaches for fraud feature\nengineering called B-tests and W-tests, which generalize the concepts of\nBenford's Law for fraud anomalies detection. Our results showed that B-tests\nand W-tests give a significant increase to the quality of our antifraud models.\nThe SpiderNet code is available at https://github.com/aasmirnova24/SpiderNet",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of cost effective battery storage and the decline in the\nsolar photovoltaic (PV) levelized cost of energy (LCOE), the number of\nbehind-the-meter solar PV systems is expected to increase steadily. The ability\nto estimate solar generation from these latent systems is crucial for a range\nof applications, including distribution system planning and operation, demand\nresponse, and non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). This paper investigates the\nproblem of disaggregating solar generation from smart meter data when\nhistorical disaggregated data from the target home is unavailable, and\ndeployment characteristics of the PV system are unknown. The proposed approach\nentails inferring the physical characteristics from smart meter data and\ndisaggregating solar generation using an iterative algorithm. This algorithm\ntakes advantage of solar generation data (aka proxy measurements) from a few\nsites that are located in the same area as the target home, and solar\ngeneration data synthesized using a physical PV model. We evaluate our methods\nwith 4 different proxy settings on around 160 homes in the United States and\nAustralia, and show that the solar disaggregation accuracy is improved by\n32.31% and 15.66% over two state-of-the-art methods using only one real proxy\nalong with three synthetic proxies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using the\ndisaggregated home load rather than the net load data could improve the overall\naccuracy of three popular NILM methods by at least 22%.",

We demonstrate MetaSys's versatility and\nease-of-use by implementing and evaluating three cross-layer techniques for:\n(i) prefetching for graph analytics; (ii) bounds checking in memory unsafe\nlanguages, and (iii) return address protection in stack frames; each technique\nonly requiring ~100 lines of Chisel code over MetaSys.\nUsing MetaSys, we perform the first detailed experimental study to quantify\nthe performance overheads of using a single metadata management system to\nenable multiple cross-layer optimizations in CPUs. We identify the key sources\nof bottlenecks and system inefficiency of a general metadata management system.\nWe design MetaSys to minimize these inefficiencies and provide increased\nversatility compared to previously-proposed metadata systems.

In semantic segmentation, it is\nattractive to train models on annotated images from a simulated (source) domain\nand deploy them on real (target) domains. In this work, we present a novel\nframework for unsupervised domain adaptation based on the notion of\ntarget-domain consistency training. Intuitively, our work is based on the idea\nthat in order to perform well on the target domain, a model's output should be\nconsistent with respect to small perturbations of inputs in the target domain.\nSpecifically, we introduce a new loss term to enforce pixelwise consistency\nbetween the model's predictions on a target image and a perturbed version of\nthe same image. In comparison to popular adversarial adaptation methods, our\napproach is simpler, easier to implement, and more memory-efficient during\ntraining. Experiments and extensive ablation studies demonstrate that our\nsimple approach achieves remarkably strong results on two challenging\nsynthetic-to-real benchmarks, GTA5-to-Cityscapes and SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes.\nCode is available at: https://github.com/lukemelas/pixmatch",

    "abstract": "Many attempts have been made towards combining RGB and 3D poses for the\nrecognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADL). ADL may look very similar and\noften necessitate to model fine-grained details to distinguish them. Because\nthe recent 3D ConvNets are too rigid to capture the subtle visual patterns\nacross an action, this research direction is dominated by methods combining RGB\nand 3D Poses. But the cost of computing 3D poses from RGB stream is high in the\nabsence of appropriate sensors. This limits the usage of aforementioned\napproaches in real-world applications requiring low latency. Then, how to best\ntake advantage of 3D Poses for recognizing ADL? To this end, we propose an\nextension of a pose driven attention mechanism: Video-Pose Network (VPN),\nexploring two distinct directions. One is to transfer the Pose knowledge into\nRGB through a feature-level distillation and the other towards mimicking pose\ndriven attention through an attention-level distillation. Finally, these two\napproaches are integrated into a single model, we call VPN++. We show that\nVPN++ is not only effective but also provides a high speed up and high\nresilience to noisy Poses. VPN++, with or without 3D Poses, outperforms the\nrepresentative baselines on 4 public datasets. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/srijandas07/vpnplusplus.",

    "abstract": "Deep data types are those that are defined in terms of other such data types,\nincluding, possibly, themselves. In that case, they are said to be truly\nnested. Deep induction is an extension of structural induction that traverses\nall of the structure in a deep data type, propagating predicates on its\nprimitive data throughout the entire structure. Deep induction can be used to\nprove properties of nested types, including truly nested types, that cannot be\nproved via structural induction. In this paper we show how to extend deep\ninduction to deep GADTs that are not truly nested. We also show that deep\ninduction cannot be extended to truly nested GADTs.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed significant advances in technologies and services\nin modern network applications, including smart grid management, wireless\ncommunication, cybersecurity as well as multi-agent autonomous systems.\nConsidering the heterogeneous nature of networked entities, emerging network\napplications call for game-theoretic models and learning-based approaches in\norder to create distributed network intelligence that responds to uncertainties\nand disruptions in a dynamic or an adversarial environment. This paper\narticulates the confluence of networks, games and learning, which establishes a\ntheoretical underpinning for understanding multi-agent decision-making over\nnetworks. We provide an selective overview of game-theoretic learning\nalgorithms within the framework of stochastic approximation theory, and\nassociated applications in some representative contexts of modern network\nsystems, such as the next generation wireless communication networks, the smart\ngrid and distributed machine learning. In addition to existing research works\non game-theoretic learning over networks, we highlight several new angles and\nresearch endeavors on learning in games that are related to recent developments\nin artificial intelligence. Some of the new angles extrapolate from our own\nresearch interests. The overall objective of the paper is to provide the reader\na clear picture of the strengths and challenges of adopting game-theoretic\nlearning methods within the context of network systems, and further to identify\nfruitful future research directions on both theoretical and applied studies.",

However, as occlusions limit the vehicle's perception ability,\nreasoning about potential hazards beyond the field-of-view is one of the most\nchallenging issues in developing autonomous driving systems. This paper\nintroduces a novel analytical approach that poses the problem of safe\ntrajectory planning under occlusions as a hybrid zero-sum dynamic game between\nthe autonomous vehicle (evader), and an initially hidden traffic participant\n(pursuer). Due to occlusions, the pursuer's state is initially unknown to the\nevader and may later be discovered by the vehicle's sensors. The analysis\nyields optimal strategies for both players as well as the set of initial\nconditions from which the autonomous vehicle is guaranteed to avoid collisions.\nWe leverage this theoretical result to develop a novel trajectory planning\nframework for autonomous driving that provides worst-case safety guarantees\nwhile minimizing conservativeness by accounting for the vehicle's ability to\nactively avoid other road users as soon as they are detected in future\nobservations. Our framework is agnostic to the driving environment and suitable\nfor various motion planners.

    "abstract": "Time-series representation learning is a fundamental task for time-series\nanalysis. While significant progress has been made to achieve accurate\nrepresentations for downstream applications, the learned representations often\nlack interpretability and do not expose semantic meanings. Different from\nprevious efforts on the entangled feature space, we aim to extract the\nsemantic-rich temporal correlations in the latent interpretable factorized\nrepresentation of the data. Motivated by the success of disentangled\nrepresentation learning in computer vision, we study the possibility of\nlearning semantic-rich time-series representations, which remains unexplored\ndue to three main challenges: 1) sequential data structure introduces complex\ntemporal correlations and makes the latent representations hard to interpret,\n2) sequential models suffer from KL vanishing problem, and 3) interpretable\nsemantic concepts for time-series often rely on multiple factors instead of\nindividuals. To bridge the gap, we propose Disentangle Time Series (DTS), a\nnovel disentanglement enhancement framework for sequential data. Specifically,\nto generate hierarchical semantic concepts as the interpretable and\ndisentangled representation of time-series, DTS introduces multi-level\ndisentanglement strategies by covering both individual latent factors and group\nsemantic segments. We further theoretically show how to alleviate the KL\nvanishing problem: DTS introduces a mutual information maximization term, while\npreserving a heavier penalty on the total correlation and the dimension-wise KL\nto keep the disentanglement property. Experimental results on various\nreal-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the representations learned by\nDTS achieve superior performance in downstream applications, with high\ninterpretability of semantic concepts.",

In response to\nthis ever-growing demand, the Alliance for Open Media (AOM) and the Joint Video\nExperts Team (JVET) have demonstrated strong and renewed interest in developing\nnew video codecs. In the fast-changing video codecs' landscape, there is thus,\na genuine need to develop adaptive methods that can be universally applied to\ndifferent codecs. In this study, we formulate video encoding as a\nmulti-objective optimization process where video quality (as a function of VMAF\nand PSNR), bitrate demands, and encoding rate (in encoded frames per second)\nare jointly optimized, going beyond the standard video encoding approaches that\nfocus on rate control targeting specific bandwidths.

We demonstrate our\nadaptive video encoding approach that leverages the generated forward\nprediction models that qualify for real-time adaptation using different codecs\n(e.g., SVT-AV1 and x265) for a variety of video datasets and resolutions. To\nmotivate our approach and establish the promise for future fast VVC encoders,\nwe also perform a comparative performance evaluation using both subjective and\nobjective metrics and report on bitrate savings among all possible pairs\nbetween VVC, SVT-AV1, x265, and VP9 codecs.",

    "title": "In Search of Socio-Technical Congruence: A Large-Scale Longitudinal  Study",
    "abstract": "We report on a large-scale empirical study investigating the relevance of\nsocio-technical congruence over key basic software quality metrics, namely,\nbugs and churn. In particular, we explore whether alignment or misalignment of\nsocial communication structures and technical dependencies in large software\nprojects influences software quality. To this end, we have defined a\nquantitative and operational notion of socio-technical congruence, which we\ncall socio-technical motif congruence (STMC). STMC is a measure of the degree\nto which developers working on the same file or on two related files, need to\ncommunicate. As socio-technical congruence is a complex and multi-faceted\nphenomenon, the interpretability of the results is one of our main concerns, so\nwe have employed a careful mixed-methods statistical analysis. In particular,\nwe provide analyses with similar techniques as employed by seminal work in the\nfield to ensure comparability of our results with the existing body of work.\nThe major result of our study, based on an analysis of 25 large open-source\nprojects, is that STMC is not related to project quality measures -- software\nbugs and churn -- in any temporal scenario. That is, we find no statistical\nrelationship between the alignment of developer tasks and developer\ncommunications on the one hand, and project outcomes on the other hand. We\nconclude that, wherefore congruence does matter as literature shows, then its\nmeasurable effect lies elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "Real-world binary classification tasks are in many cases imbalanced, where\nthe minority class is much smaller than the majority class. This skewness is\nchallenging for machine learning algorithms as they tend to focus on the\nmajority and greatly misclassify the minority. Adding synthetic minority\nsamples to the dataset before training the model is a popular technique to\naddress this difficulty and is commonly achieved by interpolating minority\nsamples. Tabular datasets are often multi-modal and contain discrete\n(categorical) features in addition to continuous ones which makes interpolation\nof samples non-trivial. To address this, we propose a latent space\ninterpolation framework which (1) maps the multi-modal samples to a dense\ncontinuous latent space using an autoencoder; (2) applies oversampling by\ninterpolation in the latent space; and (3) maps the synthetic samples back to\nthe original feature space. We defined metrics to directly evaluate the quality\nof the minority data generated and showed that our framework generates better\nsynthetic data than the existing methods. Furthermore, the superior synthetic\ndata yields better prediction quality in downstream binary classification\ntasks, as was demonstrated in extensive experiments with 27 publicly available\nreal-world datasets",

Specifically, video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI),\nwhich captures high-speed video using a low-speed camera is considered in this\nwork, in which multiple (B) video frames can be reconstructed from a snapshot\nmeasurement. One research gap in previous studies is how to adapt B in the\nvideo SCI system for different scenes. In this paper, we fill this gap\nutilizing reinforcement learning (RL). An RL model, as well as various\nconvolutional neural networks for reconstruction, are learned to achieve\nadaptive sensing of video SCI systems. Furthermore, the performance of an\nobject detection network using directly the video SCI measurements without\nreconstruction is also used to perform RL-based adaptive video compressive\nsensing.

This includes such fundamental\nproblems as topological sorting and acyclicity testing. We also study the\nrelated problems of finding a minimum feedback arc set (edges whose removal\nyields an acyclic graph), and finding a sink vertex. We are interested in both\nadversarially-ordered and randomly-ordered streams. For arbitrary input graphs\nwith edges ordered adversarially, we show that most of these problems have high\nspace complexity, precluding sublinear-space solutions. Some lower bounds also\napply when the stream is randomly ordered: e.g., in our most technical result\nwe show that testing acyclicity in the $p$-pass random-order model requires\nroughly $n^{1+1/p}$ space. For other problems, random ordering can make a\ndramatic difference: e.g., it is possible to find a sink in an acyclic\ntournament in the one-pass random-order model using polylog$(n)$ space whereas\nunder adversarial ordering roughly $n^{1/p}$ space is necessary and sufficient\ngiven $\\Theta(p)$ passes. We also design sublinear algorithms for the feedback\narc set problem in tournament graphs; for random graphs; and for randomly\nordered streams. In some cases, we give lower bounds establishing that our\nalgorithms are essentially space-optimal.

    "abstract": "The inherent dynamics of the neuron membrane potential in Spiking Neural\nNetworks (SNNs) allows processing of sequential learning tasks, avoiding the\ncomplexity of recurrent neural networks. The highly-sparse spike-based\ncomputations in such spatio-temporal data can be leveraged for\nenergy-efficiency. However, the membrane potential incurs additional memory\naccess bottlenecks in current SNN hardware. To that effect, we propose a\n10T-SRAM compute-in-memory (CIM) macro, specifically designed for\nstate-of-the-art SNN inference. It consists of a fused weight (WMEM) and\nmembrane potential (VMEM) memory and inherently exploits sparsity in input\nspikes leading to 97.4% reduction in energy-delay-product (EDP) at 85% sparsity\n(typical of SNNs considered in this work) compared to the case of no sparsity.\nWe propose staggered data mapping and reconfigurable peripherals for handling\ndifferent bit-precision requirements of WMEM and VMEM, while supporting\nmultiple neuron functionalities. The proposed macro was fabricated in 65nm CMOS\ntechnology, achieving an energy-efficiency of 0.99TOPS/W at 0.85V supply and\n200MHz frequency for signed 11-bit operations.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we combine the nonlinear HWENO reconstruction in\n\\cite{newhwenozq} and the fixed-point iteration with Gauss-Seidel fast sweeping\nstrategy, to solve the static Hamilton-Jacobi equations in a novel HWENO\nframework recently developed in \\cite{mehweno1}. The proposed HWENO frameworks\nenjoys several advantages. First, compared with the traditional HWENO\nframework, the proposed methods do not need to introduce additional auxiliary\nequations to update the derivatives of the unknown function $\\phi$. They are\nnow computed from the current value of $\\phi$ and the previous spatial\nderivatives of $\\phi$. This approach saves the computational storage and CPU\ntime, which greatly improves the computational efficiency of the traditional\nHWENO scheme. In addition, compared with the traditional WENO method,\nreconstruction stencil of the HWENO methods becomes more compact, their\nboundary treatment is simpler, and the numerical errors are smaller on the same\nmesh. Second, the fixed-point fast sweeping method is used to update the\nnumerical approximation. It is an explicit method and does not involve the\ninverse operation of nonlinear Hamiltonian, therefore any Hamilton-Jacobi\nequations with complex Hamiltonian can be solved easily. It also resolves some\nknown issues, including that the iterative number is very sensitive to the\nparameter $\\varepsilon$ used in the nonlinear weights, as observed in previous\nstudies. Finally, in order to further reduce the computational cost, a hybrid\nstrategy is also presented. Extensive numerical experiments are performed on\ntwo-dimensional problems, which demonstrate the good performance of the\nproposed fixed-point fast sweeping HWENO methods.",

The matching stage (also known as the retrieval step) identifies a\nsmall fraction of relevant items from billion-scale item corpus in low latency\nand computational cost. Item-to-item collaborative filter (item-based CF) and\nembedding-based retrieval (EBR) have been long used in the industrial matching\nstage owing to its efficiency. However, item-based CF is hard to meet\npersonalization, while EBR has difficulty in satisfying diversity. In this\npaper, we propose a novel matching architecture, Path-based Deep Network (named\nPDN), which can incorporate both personalization and diversity to enhance\nmatching performance. Specifically, PDN is comprised of two modules: Trigger\nNet and Similarity Net. PDN utilizes Trigger Net to capture the user's interest\nin each of his/her interacted item, and Similarity Net to evaluate the\nsimilarity between each interacted item and the target item based on these\nitems' profile and CF information. The final relevance between the user and the\ntarget item is calculated by explicitly considering user's diverse interests,\n\\ie aggregating the relevance weights of the related two-hop paths (one hop of\na path corresponds to user-item interaction and the other to item-item\nrelevance). Furthermore, we describe the architecture design of a matching\nsystem with the proposed PDN in a leading real-world E-Commerce service (Mobile\nTaobao App). Based on offline evaluations and online A/B test, we show that PDN\noutperforms the existing solutions for the same task. The online results also\ndemonstrate that PDN can retrieve more personalized and more diverse relevant\nitems to significantly improve user engagement. Currently, PDN system has been\nsuccessfully deployed at Mobile Taobao App and handling major online traffic.",

    "abstract": "Due to the scarcity of annotated scene flow data, self-supervised scene flow\nlearning in point clouds has attracted increasing attention. In the\nself-supervised manner, establishing correspondences between two point clouds\nto approximate scene flow is an effective approach. Previous methods often\nobtain correspondences by applying point-wise matching that only takes the\ndistance on 3D point coordinates into account, introducing two critical issues:\n(1) it overlooks other discriminative measures, such as color and surface\nnormal, which often bring fruitful clues for accurate matching; and (2) it\noften generates sub-par performance, as the matching is operated in an\nunconstrained situation, where multiple points can be ended up with the same\ncorresponding point. To address the issues, we formulate this matching task as\nan optimal transport problem. The output optimal assignment matrix can be\nutilized to guide the generation of pseudo ground truth. In this optimal\ntransport, we design the transport cost by considering multiple descriptors and\nencourage one-to-one matching by mass equality constraints. Also, constructing\na graph on the points, a random walk module is introduced to encourage the\nlocal consistency of the pseudo labels. Comprehensive experiments on\nFlyingThings3D and KITTI show that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance among self-supervised learning methods. Our self-supervised method\neven performs on par with some supervised learning approaches, although we do\nnot need any ground truth flow for training.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed great progress on building emotional chatbots.\nTremendous methods have been proposed for chatbots to generate responses with\ngiven emotions. However, the emotion changes of the user during the\nconversation has not been fully explored. In this work, we study the problem of\npositive emotion elicitation, which aims to generate responses that can elicit\npositive emotion of the user, in human-machine conversation. We propose a\nweakly supervised Emotion Eliciting Machine (EEM) to address this problem.\nSpecifically, we first collect weak labels of user emotion status changes in a\nconversion based on a pre-trained emotion classifier. Then we propose a dual\nencoder-decoder structure to model the generation of responses in both positive\nand negative side based on the changes of the user's emotion status in the\nconversation. An emotion eliciting factor is introduced on top of the dual\nstructure to balance the positive and negative emotional impacts on the\ngenerated response during emotion elicitation. The factor also provides a\nfine-grained controlling manner for emotion elicitation. Experimental results\non a large real-world dataset show that EEM outperforms the existing models in\ngenerating responses with positive emotion elicitation.",

    "abstract": "Detecting tiny objects in a high-resolution video is challenging because the\nvisual information is little and unreliable. Specifically, the challenge\nincludes very low resolution of the objects, MPEG artifacts due to compression\nand a large searching area with many hard negatives. Tracking is equally\ndifficult because of the unreliable appearance, and the unreliable motion\nestimation. Luckily, we found that by combining this two challenging tasks\ntogether, there will be mutual benefits. Following the idea, in this paper, we\npresent a neural network model called the Recurrent Correlational Network,\nwhere detection and tracking are jointly performed over a multi-frame\nrepresentation learned through a single, trainable, and end-to-end network. The\nframework exploits a convolutional long short-term memory network for learning\ninformative appearance changes for detection, while the learned representation\nis shared in tracking for enhancing its performance. In experiments with\ndatasets containing images of scenes with small flying objects, such as birds\nand unmanned aerial vehicles, the proposed method yielded consistent\nimprovements in detection performance over deep single-frame detectors and\nexisting motion-based detectors.

To remedy\nthese issues, we first reformulate the conversational recommendation task to\nhighlight that the recommended items should be new and possibly interested by\nusers.

BOE loss provides an additional supervision signal to\nguide CRS to learn from both human-written utterances and KG.

    "abstract": "Adversarial training (AT) is one of the most effective ways for improving the\nrobustness of deep convolution neural networks (CNNs). Just like common network\ntraining, the effectiveness of AT relies on the design of basic network\ncomponents. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study on the role of the\nbasic ReLU activation component in AT for robust CNNs. We find that the\nspatially-shared and input-independent properties of ReLU activation make CNNs\nless robust to white-box adversarial attacks with either standard or\nadversarial training. To address this problem, we extend ReLU to a novel Sparta\nactivation function (Spatially attentive and Adversarially Robust Activation),\nwhich enables CNNs to achieve both higher robustness, i.e., lower error rate on\nadversarial examples, and higher accuracy, i.e., lower error rate on clean\nexamples, than the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) activation functions. We\nfurther study the relationship between Sparta and the SOTA activation\nfunctions, providing more insights about the advantages of our method. With\ncomprehensive experiments, we also find that the proposed method exhibits\nsuperior cross-CNN and cross-dataset transferability. For the former, the\nadversarially trained Sparta function for one CNN (e.g., ResNet-18) can be\nfixed and directly used to train another adversarially robust CNN (e.g.,\nResNet-34). For the latter, the Sparta function trained on one dataset (e.g.,\nCIFAR-10) can be employed to train adversarially robust CNNs on another dataset\n(e.g., SVHN).

    "abstract": "The heavy traffic and related issues have always been concerns for modern\ncities. With the help of deep learning and reinforcement learning, people have\nproposed various policies to solve these traffic-related problems, such as\nsmart traffic signal control systems and taxi dispatching systems. People\nusually validate these policies in a city simulator, since directly applying\nthem in the real city introduces real cost. However, these policies validated\nin the city simulator may fail in the real city if the simulator is\nsignificantly different from the real world. To tackle this problem, we need to\nbuild a real-like traffic simulation system. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose to learn the human routing model, which is one of the most essential\npart in the traffic simulator. This problem has two major challenges. First,\nhuman routing decisions are determined by multiple factors, besides the common\ntime and distance factor. Second, current historical routes data usually covers\njust a small portion of vehicles, due to privacy and device availability\nissues. To address these problems, we propose a theory-guided residual network\nmodel, where the theoretical part can emphasize the general principles for\nhuman routing decisions (e.g., fastest route), and the residual part can\ncapture drivable condition preferences (e.g., local road or highway). Since the\ntheoretical part is composed of traditional shortest path algorithms that do\nnot need data to train, our residual network can learn human routing models\nfrom limited data. We have conducted extensive experiments on multiple\nreal-world datasets to show the superior performance of our model, especially\nwith small data. Besides, we have also illustrated why our model is better at\nrecovering real routes through case studies.",

    "abstract": "Recently, general salient object detection (SOD) has made great progress with\nthe rapid development of deep neural networks. However, task-aware SOD has\nhardly been studied due to the lack of task-specific datasets. In this paper,\nwe construct a driving task-oriented dataset where pixel-level masks of salient\nobjects have been annotated. Comparing with general SOD datasets, we find that\nthe cross-domain knowledge difference and task-specific scene gap are two main\nchallenges to focus the salient objects when driving. Inspired by these\nfindings, we proposed a baseline model for the driving task-aware SOD via a\nknowledge transfer convolutional neural network. In this network, we construct\nan attentionbased knowledge transfer module to make up the knowledge\ndifference. In addition, an efficient boundary-aware feature decoding module is\nintroduced to perform fine feature decoding for objects in the complex\ntask-specific scenes. The whole network integrates the knowledge transfer and\nfeature decoding modules in a progressive manner. Experiments show that the\nproposed dataset is very challenging, and the proposed method outperforms 12\nstate-of-the-art methods on the dataset, which facilitates the development of\ntask-aware SOD.",

    "abstract": "The prediction for information diffusion on social networks has great\npractical significance in marketing and public opinion control. Cascade\nprediction aims to predict the individuals who will potentially repost the\nmessage on the social network. One kind of methods either exploit\ndemographical, structural, and temporal features for prediction, or explicitly\nrely on particular information diffusion models. The other kind of models are\nfully data-driven and do not require a global network structure. Thus massive\ndiffusion prediction models based on network embedding are proposed. These\nmodels embed the users into the latent space using their cascade information,\nbut are lack of consideration for the intervene among users when embedding. In\nthis paper, we propose an independent asymmetric embedding method to learn\nsocial embedding for cascade prediction. Different from existing methods, our\nmethod embeds each individual into one latent influence space and multiple\nlatent susceptibility spaces. Furthermore, our method captures the\nco-occurrence regulation of user combination in cascades to improve the\ncalculating effectiveness.

The resulting\ndirected graph is denoted by $\\overrightarrow{G}$. A strong orientation is one\nin which every vertex is reachable from every other vertex via a directed path.\nThe diameter of $\\overrightarrow{G}$, i.e., the maximum distance from one\nvertex to another, depends on the particular orientation. The minimum diameter\namong all possible orientations is called the oriented diameter\n$\\overrightarrow{\\text{diam}}(G)$ of $G$. Let $n,k$ be two integers with $1\n\\leq k < n$. In the realm of interconnection networks of processing elements,\nan $(n,k)$-star graph $S_{n,k}$ offers a topology that circumvents the lack of\nscalability of $n$-star graphs $S_n$. In this paper, we present a strong\norientation for $S_{n,k}$ that combines approaches suggested by Cheng and\nLipman [Journal of Interconnection Networks (2002)] for $S_{n,k}$ with the one\nproposed by Fujita [The First International Symposium on Computing and\nNetworking (CANDAR 2013)] for $S_n$.

The simulator, named the \"Bristol Betting\nExchange\" (BBE), is intended as a common platform, a data-source and\nexperimental test-bed, for researchers studying the application of AI and\nmachine learning (ML) techniques to issues arising in betting exchanges; and,\nas far as I have been able to determine, BBE is the first of its kind: a free\nopen-source agent-based simulation model consisting not only of a\nsports-betting exchange, but also a minimal simulation model of racetrack\nsporting events (e.g., horse-races or car-races) about which bets may be made,\nand a population of simulated bettors who each form their own private\nevaluation of odds and place bets on the exchange before and - crucially -\nduring the race itself (i.e., so-called \"in-play\" betting) and whose betting\nopinions change second-by-second as each race event unfolds.

    "abstract": "The prevalence of location tracking systems has resulted in large volumes of\nspatiotemporal data generated every day. Addressing reachability queries on\nsuch datasets is important for a wide range of applications (surveillance,\npublic health, social networks, etc.) A spatiotemporal reachability query\nidentifies whether a physical item (or information etc.) could have been\ntransferred from the source object $O_S$ to the target object $O_T$ during a\ntime interval $I$ (either directly, or through a chain of intermediate\ntransfers). In previous research on spatiotemporal reachability queries, the\nnumber of such transfers is not limited, and the weight of a piece of\ntransferred information remains the same. This paper introduces novel\nreachability queries, which assume a scenario of information decay. Such\nqueries arise when the value of information that travels through the chain of\nintermediate objects decreases with each transfer. To address such queries\nefficiently over large spatiotemporal datasets, we introduce the RICCdecay\nalgorithm. Further, the decay scenario leads to an important extension: if\nthere are many different sources of information, the aggregate value of\ninformation an object can obtain varies. As a result, we introduce a top-k\nreachability problem, identifying the k objects with the highest accumulated\ninformation. We also present the RICCtopK algorithm that can efficiently\ncompute top-k reachability with transfer decay queries. An experimental\nevaluation shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithms over previous\napproaches.",

In terms of users, ZESRec\nbuilds upon recent advances on sequential RS to represent users using their\ninteractions with items, thereby generalizing to unseen users as well.

Hence, we need alternate methods to\nestimate the number of cases. Online surveys have been shown to be an effective\nmethod for data collection amidst the pandemic. In this work, we develop\nmachine learning models to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 using\nself-reported symptoms. Our best model predicts the daily cases with a mean\nabsolute error (MAE) of 226.30 (normalized MAE of 27.09%) per state, which\ndemonstrates the possibility of predicting the actual number of confirmed cases\nby utilizing self-reported symptoms. The models are developed at two levels of\ndata granularity - local models, which are trained at the state level, and a\nsingle global model which is trained on the combined data aggregated across all\nstates. Our results indicate a lower error on the local models as opposed to\nthe global model. In addition, we also show that the most important symptoms\n(features) vary considerably from state to state.

To overcome the conservatism of the\nsymmetrical-geometry-based uncertainty sets, we develop a support vector\nclustering (SVC)-based approach to model uncertain CSI as a compact convex\nuncertainty set. Based on that, the chance constraint of D2D is converted into\na linear convex set. Then, we develop a bisection search-based power allocation\nalgorithm for solving the resource allocation in D2D underlaying cellular\nnetwork with different robust counterparts. Finally, we conduct the simulation\nto compare the proposed robust optimization approaches with the non-robust one.",

    "abstract": "We present a planning and control framework for physics-based manipulation\nunder uncertainty. The key idea is to interleave robust open-loop execution\nwith closed-loop control. We derive robustness metrics through contraction\ntheory. We use these metrics to plan trajectories that are robust to both state\nuncertainty and model inaccuracies. However, fully robust trajectories are\nextremely difficult to find or may not exist for many multi-contact\nmanipulation problems. We separate a trajectory into robust and non-robust\nsegments through a minimum cost path search on a robustness graph. Robust\nsegments are executed open-loop and non-robust segments are executed with\nmodel-predictive control. We conduct experiments on a real robotic system for\nreaching in clutter. Our results suggest that the open and closed-loop approach\nresults in up to 35% more real-world success compared to open-loop baselines\nand a 40% reduction in execution time compared to model-predictive control. We\nshow for the first time that partially open-loop manipulation plans generated\nwith our approach reach similar success rates to model-predictive control,\nwhile achieving a more fluent/real-time execution.

It not only transparently superimposes copyright patterns on\nspecific positions of digital images or video frames to declare the copyright\nownership information, but also completely erases the visible watermark image\nand thus enables restoring the original host image without any distortion.\nHowever, existing RVW algorithms mostly construct the reversible mapping\nmechanism for a specific visible watermarking scheme, which is not general.\nHence, we propose a generic RVW framework to accommodate various visible\nwatermarking schemes, which is based on Regularized Graph Fourier Transform\n(GFT) coding. In particular, we obtain a reconstruction data packet -- the\ncompressed difference image between the watermarked image and the original host\nimage, which is embedded into the watermarked image via any conventional\nreversible data hiding method to facilitate the blind recovery of the host\nimage. The key is to achieve compact compression of the difference image for\nefficient embedding of the reconstruction data packet. To this end, we propose\nregularized GFT coding, where the difference image is smoothed via the graph\nLaplacian regularizer for more efficient compression and then encoded by\nmulti-resolution GFTs in an approximately optimal manner. Experimental results\nshow that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance with\nhigh data compression efficiency, which is applicable to both gray-scale and\ncolor images. In addition, the proposed generic framework accommodates various\nvisible watermarking algorithms, which demonstrates strong versatility.",

Quantitative monitors are approximate: with every finite prefix, they\ncan improve their estimate of the infinite trace's unknown property value.\nConsequently, quantitative monitors can be compared with regard to a\nprecision-cost trade-off: better approximations of the property value require\nmore monitor resources, such as states (in the case of finite-state monitors)\nor registers, and additional resources yield better approximations. We\nintroduce a formal framework for quantitative and approximate monitoring, show\nhow it conservatively generalizes the classical boolean setting for monitoring,\nand give several precision-cost trade-offs for monitors.

However, scene text images suffer from rich noises of\ndifferent sources such as complex background and geometric distortions which\noften confuse the decoder and lead to incorrect alignment of visual features at\nnoisy decoding time steps. This paper presents I2C2W, a novel scene text\nrecognizer that is accurate and tolerant to various noises in scenes. I2C2W\nconsists of an image-to-character module (I2C) and a character-to-word module\n(C2W) which are complementary and can be trained end-to-end. I2C detects\ncharacters and predicts their relative positions in a word. It strives to\ndetect all possible characters including incorrect and redundant ones based on\ndifferent alignments of visual features without the restriction of time steps.\nTaking the detected characters as input, C2W learns from character semantics\nand their positions to filter out incorrect and redundant detection and produce\nthe final word recognition.

    "abstract": "We present EMISSOR: a platform to capture multimodal interactions as\nrecordings of episodic experiences with explicit referential interpretations\nthat also yield an episodic Knowledge Graph (eKG). The platform stores streams\nof multiple modalities as parallel signals. Each signal is segmented and\nannotated independently with interpretation. Annotations are eventually mapped\nto explicit identities and relations in the eKG. As we ground signal segments\nfrom different modalities to the same instance representations, we also ground\ndifferent modalities across each other. Unique to our eKG is that it accepts\ndifferent interpretations across modalities, sources and experiences and\nsupports reasoning over conflicting information and uncertainties that may\nresult from multimodal experiences. EMISSOR can record and annotate experiments\nin virtual and real-world, combine data, evaluate system behavior and their\nperformance for preset goals but also model the accumulation of knowledge and\ninterpretations in the Knowledge Graph as a result of these episodic\nexperiences.",

    "abstract": "In IPFS content identifiers are constructed based on the item's data\ntherefore the binding between an item's identifier and its data can be\ndeterministically verified. Nevertheless, once an item is modified, its\nidentifier also changes. Therefore when it comes to mutable content there is a\nneed for keeping track of the \"latest\" IPFS identifier. This is achieved using\nnaming protocols on top of IPFS, such as IPNS and DNSlink, that map a constant\nname to an IPFS identifier, allowing at the same time content owners to update\nthese mappings. Nevertheless, IPNS relies on a cryptographic key pair that\ncannot be rotated, and DNSlink does not provide content authenticity\nprotection. In this paper, we propose a naming protocol that combines DNSlink\nand decentralized identifiers to enable self-verifiable content items. Our\nprotocol provides content authenticity without imposing any security\nrequirement to DNSlink. Furthermore, our protocol prevent fake content even if\nattackers have access to the DNS server of the content owner or have access to\nthe content owner secret keys. Our proof of concept implementation shows that\nour protocol is feasible and can be used with existing IPFS tools.",

Nevertheless, we outline\ntwo important challenges of leveraging such models for times-series anomaly\ndetection: 1) developing effective and efficient reconstruction models and 2)\nexploiting the similarity and interrelation structures among the multivariate\ntime series data channels. To address these challenges, in this paper we\npropose a stacking variational auto-encoder (VAE) model with graph neural\nnetworks for the effective and interpretable time-series anomaly detection.\nSpecifically, we propose a stacking block-wise reconstruction framework with a\nweight-sharing scheme for the multivariate time series data with similarities\namong channels. Moreover, with a graph learning module, our model learns a\nsparse adjacency matrix to explicitly capture the stable interrelation\nstructure information among multiple time series data channels for\ninterpretable reconstruction of series patterns.

Classical approaches typically use a set of pre-defined faults for which\ncorresponding recovery actions are defined manually. This is not possible for\nmodern hybrid systems which are characterized by frequent changes. Instead,\nAI-based approaches are needed which leverage on a model of the non-faulty\nsystem and which search for a set of reconfiguration operations which will\nestablish a valid behavior again.\nThis work presents a novel algorithm which solves three main challenges: (i)\nOnly a model of the non-faulty system is needed, i.e. the faulty behavior does\nnot need to be modeled. (ii) It discretizes and reduces the search space which\noriginally is too large -- mainly due to the high number of continuous system\nvariables and control signals. (iii) It uses a SAT solver for propositional\nlogic for two purposes: First, it defines the binary concept of validity.\nSecond, it implements the search itself -- sacrificing the optimal solution for\na quick identification of an arbitrary solution.

Its core notion complements the premise of the\nresource-based view of the firm and is considered an important theoretical and\nmanagement framework in modern information systems research. However, despite\nDCTs significant contributions, its strength and core focus are essentially in\nits use for historical firm performance explanation. Furthermore, valuable\ncontributions have been made by several researchers in order to extend the DCT\nto fit the constantly changing IT environments and other imperative drivers for\ncompetitive performance. However, no DCT extension has been developed which\nallows firms to integrally assess their current state of maturity in order to\nderive imperative steps for further performance enhancements. In light of\nempirical advancement, this paper aims to develop a strategic alignment model\nfor IT flexibility and dynamic capabilities and empirically validates proposed\nhypotheses using correlation and regression analyses on a large data sample of\n322 international firms. We conjecture that the combined synergetic effect of\nthe underlying dimensions of a firms IT flexibility architecture and dynamic\ncapabilities enables organizations to cope with changing environmental\nconditions and drive competitive firm performance.

However,\nprior works did not aim for automatic initialization which is addressed here.\nIn addition to manual initialization, current methods are highly sensitive to\ninitial location and fail to delineate borders accurately. We propose a fully\nautomatic image segmentation method to address problems of manual\ninitialization, insufficient capture range, and poor convergence to boundaries,\nin addition to the problem of assignment of energy functional parameters. We\ntrain two CNNs, which predict active contour weighting parameters and generate\na ground truth mask to extract Distance Transform (DT) and an initialization\ncircle. Distance transform is used to form a vector field pointing from each\npixel of the image towards the closest point on the boundary, the size of which\nis equal to the Euclidean distance map. We evaluate our method on four publicly\navailable datasets including two building instance segmentation datasets,\nVaihingen and Bing huts, and two mammography image datasets, INBreast and\nDDSM-BCRP. Our approach outperforms latest research by 0.59 ans 2.39 percent in\nmean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), 7.38 and 8.62 percent in Boundary F-score\n(BoundF) for Vaihingen and Bing huts datasets, respectively. Dice similarity\ncoefficient for the INBreast and DDSM-BCRP datasets is 94.23% and 90.89%,\nrespectively indicating our method is comparable to state-of-the-art\nframeworks.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are one of the most important\nrepresentations of dynamical systems. They are notable for the ability to\ninclude a deterministic component of the system and a stochastic one to\nrepresent random unknown factors. However, this makes learning SDEs much more\nchallenging than ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this paper, we\npropose a data driven approach where parameters of the SDE are represented by a\nneural network with a built-in SDE integration scheme. The loss function is\nbased on a maximum likelihood criterion, under order one Markov Gaussian\nassumptions. The algorithm is applied to the geometric brownian motion and a\nstochastic version of the Lorenz-63 model. The latter is particularly hard to\nhandle due to the presence of a stochastic component that depends on the state.\nThe algorithm performance is attested using different simulations results.\nBesides, comparisons are performed with the reference gradient matching method\nused for non linear drift estimation, and a neural networks-based method, that\ndoes not consider the stochastic term.",

Using domain\nknowledge, we abstracted the raw data of medical records, for up to three\nconcepts out of four or five relevant concepts, into two interval types: State\nabstractions (e.g. LOW, HIGH) and Gradient abstractions (e.g. INCREASING,\nDECREASING). We created all uni-dimensional (State or Gradient) or\nmulti-dimensional (State and Gradient) abstraction combinations.

In this\npaper, we summarize and classify security models into the following;\ngraph-based, tree-based, and hybrid security models.

The context of\ndetecting live vs. spoofed face images may differ significantly in the target\ndomain, when compared to that of labeled source domain where the model is\ntrained. Such difference may be caused due to new and unknown spoof types,\nillumination conditions, scene backgrounds, among many others. These varieties\nof differences make the target a compound domain, thus calling for the problem\nof the unsupervised compound domain adaptation. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the compound domain assumption for the task of face\nanti-spoofing, for the first time in this work. To this end, we propose a\nmemory augmentation method for adapting the source model to the target domain\nin a domain aware manner. The adaptation process is further improved by using\nthe curriculum learning and the domain agnostic source network training\napproaches. The proposed method successfully adapts to the compound target\ndomain consisting multiple new spoof types.

The\neffects of such misalignment have not been fully investigated for eye-in-hand\nsystems - systems that have the camera (eye) mounted to the end-effector (hand)\nto gain compactness in confined spaces such as in endoscopic surgery. This\npaper provides a systematic study on the effects of the camera frame\nmisalignment in a teleoperated eye-in-hand robot and proposes a simple\ncorrection method in the view display. A simulation is designed to compare the\neffects of the misalignment under different conditions. Users are asked to move\na rigid body from its initial position to the specified target position via\nteleoperation, with different levels of misalignment simulated. It is found\nthat misalignment between the input motion and the output view is much more\ndifficult to compensate by the operators when it is in the orthogonal direction\n(~40s) compared with the opposite direction (~20s). An experiment on a real\nconcentric tube robot with an eye-in-hand configuration is also conducted.\nUsers are asked to telemanipulate the robot to complete a pick-and-place task.\nResults show that with the correction enabled, there is a significant\nimprovement in the operation performance in terms of completion time (mean\n40.6%, median 38.6%), trajectory length (mean 34.3%, median 28.1%), difficulty\n(50.5%), unsteadiness (49.4%), and mental stress (60.9%).",

    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks can enhance images taken with small mobile\ncamera sensors and excel at tasks like demoisaicing, denoising and\nsuper-resolution. However, for practical use on mobile devices these networks\noften require too many FLOPs and reducing the FLOPs of a convolution layer,\nalso reduces its parameter count. This is problematic in view of the recent\nfinding that heavily over-parameterized neural networks are often the ones that\ngeneralize best. In this paper we propose to use HyperNetworks to break the\nfixed ratio of FLOPs to parameters of standard convolutions. This allows us to\nexceed previous state-of-the-art architectures in SSIM and MS-SSIM on the\nZurich RAW- to-DSLR (ZRR) data-set at > 10x reduced FLOP-count. On ZRR we\nfurther observe generalization curves consistent with 'double-descent' behavior\nat fixed FLOP-count, in the large image limit.

    "abstract": "In games (as well as many user-facing systems), adapting content to user's\npreferences and experience is an important challenge. This paper explores a\nnovel method to realize this goal in the context of dynamic difficulty\nadjustment (DDA). Here the aim is to constantly adapt the content of a game to\nthe skill level of the player, keeping them engaged by avoiding states that are\neither too difficult or too easy. Current systems for DDA rely on expensive\ndata mining, or on hand-crafted rules designed for particular domains, and\nusually adapts to keep players in the flow, leaving no room for the designer to\npresent content that is purposefully easy or difficult. This paper presents a\nBayesian Optimization-based system for DDA that is agnostic to the domain and\nthat can target particular difficulties. We deploy this framework in two\ndifferent domains: the puzzle game Sudoku, and a simple Roguelike game. By\nmodifying the acquisition function's optimization, we are reliably able to\npresent a puzzle with a bespoke difficulty for players with different skill\nlevels in less than five iterations (for Sudoku) and fifteen iterations (for\nthe simple Roguelike), significantly outperforming simpler heuristics for\ndifficulty adjustment in said domains, with the added benefit of maintaining a\nmodel of the user. These results point towards a promising alternative for\ncontent adaption in a variety of different domains.",

The automatic\nidentification of surgical actions is needed for a range of applications,\nincluding performance assessment of trainees and surgical process modeling for\nautonomous execution and monitoring. However, supervised action identification\nis not feasible, due to the burden of manually annotating recordings of\npotentially complex and long surgical executions. Moreover, often few example\nexecutions of a surgical procedure can be recorded. This paper proposes a novel\nalgorithm for unsupervised identification of surgical actions in a standard\nsurgical training task, the ring transfer, executed with da Vinci Research Kit.\nExploiting kinematic and semantic visual features automatically extracted from\na very limited dataset of executions, we are able to significantly outperform\nthe state-of-the-art results for a similar application, improving the quality\nof segmentation (88% vs. 82% matching score) and clustering (67% vs. 54%\nF1-score) even in the presence of noise, short actions and non homogeneous\nworkflows, i.e. non repetitive action sequences. Full action identification on\nhardware with standard commercial specifications is performed in less than 1 s\nfor single execution.",

    "title": "Modeling the Sequential Dependence among Audience Multi-step Conversions  with Multi-task Learning in Targeted Display Advertising",
    "abstract": "In most real-world large-scale online applications (e.g., e-commerce or\nfinance), customer acquisition is usually a multi-step conversion process of\naudiences. For example, an impression->click->purchase process is usually\nperformed of audiences for e-commerce platforms. However, it is more difficult\nto acquire customers in financial advertising (e.g., credit card advertising)\nthan in traditional advertising. On the one hand, the audience multi-step\nconversion path is longer. On the other hand, the positive feedback is sparser\n(class imbalance) step by step, and it is difficult to obtain the final\npositive feedback due to the delayed feedback of activation. Multi-task\nlearning is a typical solution in this direction. While considerable multi-task\nefforts have been made in this direction, a long-standing challenge is how to\nexplicitly model the long-path sequential dependence among audience multi-step\nconversions for improving the end-to-end conversion. In this paper, we propose\nan Adaptive Information Transfer Multi-task (AITM) framework, which models the\nsequential dependence among audience multi-step conversions via the Adaptive\nInformation Transfer (AIT) module. The AIT module can adaptively learn what and\nhow much information to transfer for different conversion stages. Besides, by\ncombining the Behavioral Expectation Calibrator in the loss function, the AITM\nframework can yield more accurate end-to-end conversion identification. The\nproposed framework is deployed in Meituan app, which utilizes it to real-timely\nshow a banner to the audience with a high end-to-end conversion rate for\nMeituan Co-Branded Credit Cards. Offline experimental results on both\nindustrial and public real-world datasets clearly demonstrate that the proposed\nframework achieves significantly better performance compared with\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

In their seminal work,\nGoldreich and Ron [STOC 2009; SICOMP 2011] show that the graph properties that\nallow constant-query proximity-oblivious testing in the bounded-degree model\nare precisely the properties that can be expressed as a generalised subgraph\nfreeness (GSF) property that satisfies the non-propagation condition. It is\nleft open whether the non-propagation condition is necessary. Indeed, calling\nproperties expressible as a generalised subgraph freeness property GSF-local\nproperties, they ask whether all GSF-local properties are non-propagating. We\ngive a negative answer by exhibiting a property of graphs that is GSF-local and\npropagating. Hence in particular, our property does not admit a POT, despite\nbeing GSF-local. We prove our result by exploiting a recent work of the authors\nwhich constructed a first-order (FO) property that is not testable [SODA 2021],\nand a new connection between FO properties and GSF-local properties via\nneighbourhood profiles.",

    "abstract": "Studies evaluating bikeability usually compute spatial indicators shaping\ncycling conditions and conflate them in a quantitative index. Much research\ninvolves site visits or conventional geospatial approaches, and few studies\nhave leveraged street view imagery (SVI) for conducting virtual audits. These\nhave assessed a limited range of aspects, and not all have been automated using\ncomputer vision (CV). Furthermore, studies have not yet zeroed in on gauging\nthe usability of these technologies thoroughly. We investigate, with\nexperiments at a fine spatial scale and across multiple geographies (Singapore\nand Tokyo), whether we can use SVI and CV to assess bikeability\ncomprehensively. Extending related work, we develop an exhaustive index of\nbikeability composed of 34 indicators. The results suggest that SVI and CV are\nadequate to evaluate bikeability in cities comprehensively. As they\noutperformed non-SVI counterparts by a wide margin, SVI indicators are also\nfound to be superior in assessing urban bikeability, and potentially can be\nused independently, replacing traditional techniques. However, the paper\nexposes some limitations, suggesting that the best way forward is combining\nboth SVI and non-SVI approaches. The new bikeability index presents a\ncontribution in transportation and urban analytics, and it is scalable to\nassess cycling appeal widely.",

Most of the current works focus on estimating grasp pose from\npoint clouds based on an efficient single-shot grasp detection network.\nHowever, due to the lack of geometry awareness of the local grasping area, it\nmay cause severe collisions and unstable grasp configurations.

Furthermore, we extend the 6-DoF grasp with an extra dimension as\ngrasp width which is critical for collisionless grasping in cluttered scenes.\nIt takes a single-view point cloud as input and predicts dense and precise\ngrasp configurations. To enhance the generalization ability, we build a\nsynthetic single-object grasp dataset including 150 commodities of various\nshapes, and a multi-object cluttered scene dataset including 100k point clouds\nwith robust, dense grasp poses and mask annotations.

However, due to the issue of limited dataset\navailability and the strict legal and ethical requirements for patient privacy\nprotection, the broad applications of medical imaging classification driven by\nDNN with large-scale training data have been largely hindered. For example,\nwhen training the DNN from one domain (e.g., with data only from one hospital),\nthe generalization capability to another domain (e.g., data from another\nhospital) could be largely lacking. In this paper, we aim to tackle this\nproblem by developing the privacy-preserving constrained domain generalization\nmethod, aiming to improve the generalization capability under the\nprivacy-preserving condition. In particular, We propose to improve the\ninformation aggregation process on the centralized server-side with a novel\ngradient alignment loss, expecting that the trained model can be better\ngeneralized to the \"unseen\" but related medical images. The rationale and\neffectiveness of our proposed method can be explained by connecting our\nproposed method with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) which has been widely\nadopted as the distribution distance measurement.

We\naim at predicting the travel time of trains on rail sections at the scale of an\nentire rail network in real-time, by estimating trains' delays relative to a\ntheoretical circulation plan. Existing implementations within railway companies\ngenerally work using the approximation that a train's delay will stay constant\nfor the rest of its trip.\nPredicting the evolution of a given train's delay is a uniquely hard problem,\ndistinct from mainstream road traffic forecasting problems, since it involves\nseveral hard-to-model phenomena: train spacing, station congestion and\nheterogeneous rolling stock among others. We first offer empirical evidence of\nthe previously unexplored phenomenon of delay propagation in the French\nNational Railway Network, leading to delays being amplified by interactions\nbetween trains. We then contribute a novel technique using the transformer\narchitecture and pre-trained embeddings to make real-time massively parallel\npredictions for train delays at the scale of the whole rail network (over 3k\ntrains at peak hours, making predictions at an average horizon of 70 minutes).\nOur approach yields very positive results on real-world data when compared to\ncurrently-used and experimental prediction techniques.

    "abstract": "Industry is part of an economy that produces highly mechanized and automated\nmaterial goods. Since the beginning of industrialization, there have been\nseveral stages and paradigm shifts that today are ex-post-so-called industrial\nrevolutions: in the field of mechanization (called the 1st industrial\nrevolution), the intensive use of electrical energy (called the 2nd industrial\nrevolution) and widespread digitization (called the 3rd industrial revolution).\nIn this sense, for this future expectation, the term (Industry 4.0) was\nestablished for a 4th industrial revolution. Developments especially in Europe,\nbut also in the United States, coined as the Industrial Internet, are often\ncompared with the continuation of disruptive increases in industrial\nproduction, such as revolutions initiated by steam, electricity, etc. Aspects\nof continuous workforce training, and the use of sustainability resources in\nindustrial, economic and general IT governance policies are not widespread and\nare the main problems and challenges in paradigms in Industry 4.0.

    "abstract": "Cost-effective and high-precision surrogate modeling is a cornerstone of\nautomated industrial and engineering systems. Active learning coupled with\nGaussian process (GP) surrogate modeling is an indispensable tool for demanding\nand complex systems, while the existence of heterogeneity in underlying systems\nmay adversely affect the modeling process. In order to improve the learning\nefficiency under the regime, we propose the partitioned active learning\nstrategy established upon partitioned GP (PGP) modeling. Our strategy seeks the\nmost informative design point for PGP modeling systematically in twosteps. The\nglobal searching scheme accelerates the exploration aspect of active learning\nby investigating the most uncertain design space, and the local searching\nexploits the active learning criterion induced by the local GP model. We also\nprovide numerical remedies to alleviate the computational cost of active\nlearning, thereby allowing the proposed method to incorporate a large amount of\ncandidates. The proposed method is applied to numerical simulation and real\nworld cases endowed with heterogeneities in which surrogate models are\nconstructed to embed in (i) the cost-efficient automatic fuselage shape control\nsystem; and (ii) the optimal design system of tribocorrosion-resistant alloys.\nThe results show that our approach outperforms benchmark methods.",

This results in highly\nimbalanced subsets of data between clients, noted as a key issue in FL\nscenarios. A series of models is trained using `high-volume' clients that\ncontribute 100 audio clips or more, testing the effects of varying FL\nparameters, followed by an additional model trained using all clients with no\nminimum audio contribution. It is shown that FL models trained using the\nhigh-volume clients can perform similarly to a centrally-trained model, though\nthere is much more noise in results than would typically be expected for a\ncentrally-trained model.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the tremendous research interests in network\nembedding. Extant works have taken the neighborhood formation as the critical\ninformation to reveal the inherent dynamics of network structures, and\nsuggested encoding temporal edge formation sequences to capture the historical\ninfluences of neighbors. In this paper, however, we argue that the edge\nformation can be attributed to a variety of driving factors including the\ntemporal influence, which is better referred to as multiple aspects. As a\nmatter of fact, different node aspects can drive the formation of distinctive\nneighbors, giving birth to the multi-aspect embedding that relates to but goes\nbeyond a temporal scope. Along this vein, we propose a Mixture of Hawkes-based\nTemporal Network Embeddings (MHNE) model to capture the aspect-driven\nneighborhood formation of networks. In MHNE, we encode the multi-aspect\nembeddings into the mixture of Hawkes processes to gain the advantages in\nmodeling the excitation effects and the latent aspects. Specifically, a graph\nattention mechanism is used to assign different weights to account for the\nexcitation effects of history events, while a Gumbel-Softmax is plugged in to\nderive the distribution over the aspects. Extensive experiments on 8 different\ntemporal networks have demonstrated the great performance of the multi-aspect\nembeddings obtained by MHNE in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Curiosity is a general method for augmenting an environment reward with an\nintrinsic reward, which encourages exploration and is especially useful in\nsparse reward settings. As curiosity is calculated using next state prediction\nerror, the type of state encoding used has a large impact on performance.\nRandom features and inverse-dynamics features are generally preferred over VAEs\nbased on previous results from Atari and other mostly 2D environments. However,\nunlike VAEs, they may not encode sufficient information for optimal behaviour,\nwhich becomes increasingly important as environments become more complex. In\nthis paper, we use the sparse reward 3D physics environment Animal-AI, to\ndemonstrate how a fixed $\\beta$-VAE encoding can be used effectively with\ncuriosity. We combine this with curriculum learning to solve the previously\nunsolved exploration intensive detour tasks while achieving 22\\% gain in sample\nefficiency on the training curriculum against the next best encoding.

We examine these\nclassical questions in a pivotal participation game, a variant of public good\ngames, where heterogeneous agents make binary participation decisions on\ncontributing their endowments, and the public project succeeds when it has\nenough contributions.\nWe prove it is NP-complete to decide the existence of a cooperative Nash\nequilibrium such that the project succeeds. We also identify two natural\nspecial scenarios where this decision problem is tractable. We then propose two\nalgorithms to help cooperation in the game. Our first algorithm adds an\nexternal investment to the public project, and our second algorithm uses\nmatching funds. We show that the cost to induce a cooperative Nash equilibrium\nis near-optimal for both algorithms. Finally, the cost of matching funds can\nalways be smaller than the cost of adding an external investment. Intuitively,\nmatching funds provide a greater incentive for cooperation than adding an\nexternal investment does.",

    "abstract": "Recent work for image captioning mainly followed an extract-then-generate\nparadigm, pre-extracting a sequence of object-based features and then\nformulating image captioning as a single sequence-to-sequence task. Although\npromising, we observed two problems in generated captions: 1) content\ninconsistency where models would generate contradicting facts; 2) not\ninformative enough where models would miss parts of important information. From\na causal perspective, the reason is that models have captured spurious\nstatistical correlations between visual features and certain expressions (e.g.,\nvisual features of \"long hair\" and \"woman\"). In this paper, we propose a\ndependent multi-task learning framework with the causal intervention (DMTCI).\nFirstly, we involve an intermediate task, bag-of-categories generation, before\nthe final task, image captioning. The intermediate task would help the model\nbetter understand the visual features and thus alleviate the content\ninconsistency problem. Secondly, we apply Pearl's do-calculus on the model,\ncutting off the link between the visual features and possible confounders and\nthus letting models focus on the causal visual features. Specifically, the\nhigh-frequency concept set is considered as the proxy confounders where the\nreal confounders are inferred in the continuous space. Finally, we use a\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) strategy to enable end-to-end\ntraining and reduce the inter-task error accumulations. The extensive\nexperiments show that our model outperforms the baseline models and achieves\ncompetitive performance with state-of-the-art models.",

    "abstract": "Model inversion, whose goal is to recover training data from a pre-trained\nmodel, has been recently proved feasible. However, existing inversion methods\nusually suffer from the mode collapse problem, where the synthesized instances\nare highly similar to each other and thus show limited effectiveness for\ndownstream tasks, such as knowledge distillation. In this paper, we propose\nContrastive Model Inversion~(CMI), where the data diversity is explicitly\nmodeled as an optimizable objective, to alleviate the mode collapse issue. Our\nmain observation is that, under the constraint of the same amount of data,\nhigher data diversity usually indicates stronger instance discrimination. To\nthis end, we introduce in CMI a contrastive learning objective that encourages\nthe synthesizing instances to be distinguishable from the already synthesized\nones in previous batches. Experiments of pre-trained models on CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CMI not only generates more\nvisually plausible instances than the state of the arts, but also achieves\nsignificantly superior performance when the generated data are used for\nknowledge distillation.

Several theories have been proposed to\nexplain additive compositionality, but the following questions remain\nunanswered: (Q1) The assumptions of those theories do not hold for the\npractical word embedding. (Q2) Ordinary additive compositionality can be seen\nas an AND operation of word meanings, but it is not well understood how other\noperations, such as OR and NOT, can be computed by the embeddings.

    "abstract": "With rapid advances in computing systems, there is an increasing demand for\nmore effective and efficient access control (AC) approaches. Recently,\nAttribute Based Access Control (ABAC) approaches have been shown to be\npromising in fulfilling the AC needs of such emerging complex computing\nenvironments. An ABAC model grants access to a requester based on attributes of\nentities in a system and an authorization policy; however, its generality and\nflexibility come with a higher cost. Further, increasing complexities of\norganizational systems and the need for federated accesses to their resources\nmake the task of AC enforcement and management much more challenging. In this\npaper, we propose an adaptive ABAC policy learning approach to automate the\nauthorization management task. We model ABAC policy learning as a reinforcement\nlearning problem. In particular, we propose a contextual bandit system, in\nwhich an authorization engine adapts an ABAC model through a feedback control\nloop; it relies on interacting with users/administrators of the system to\nreceive their feedback that assists the model in making authorization\ndecisions. We propose four methods for initializing the learning model and a\nplanning approach based on attribute value hierarchy to accelerate the learning\nprocess. We focus on developing an adaptive ABAC policy learning model for a\nhome IoT environment as a running example. We evaluate our proposed approach\nover real and synthetic data. We consider both complete and sparse datasets in\nour evaluations. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach\nachieves performance that is comparable to ones based on supervised learning in\nmany scenarios and even outperforms them in several situations.",

    "abstract": "In facing with the explosive Internet traffic growth, optical transport\nnetworks based on WDM technologies forming the core part of Internet\ninfrastructure carrying multi-Tb/s has to be re-considered from both designing,\nplanning, operation and management perspectives to attain greater efficiency.\nThanks to the convergence of significant advances in optical transmission\ntechnologies, and photonic switching, transparent (all-optical) architecture\nhas come into practice, paving the way for eliminating the over-utilization of\ncostly optical-electrical-optical (O-E-O) interfaces and hence, yielding\nremarkable savings of cost and energy consumption compared to opaque\narchitecture. Traditional designs for transparent optical networks based on\nsingle-objective optimization model aiming at optimizing solely a single\nperformance metric appears to be insufficient to capture the nuances of\npractical designs while conventional multi-objective approach tends to reach\n(non-) optimal solutions. Different from existing works, we present a new\nframework for multi-objective WDM network designs capturing several goals on\none hand and on the other hand, achieving optimal solutions. Moreover, our\nproposal exploits the characteristics of each constituent objectives to lay the\nfoundation for setting up weight coefficient so that the order of optimization\nis guaranteed. Equally important, our proposal is pragmatic in the sense that\nthe complexity of the optimization model remains the same as the\nsingle-objective model while the quality of solution has been greatly improved.\nWe have extensively tested realistic optical core networks topologies, that is,\nCOST239 and NSFNET, with various network traffic conditions and it turns out\nthat our design brings about a saving of wavelength link usage up to roughly\n$28\\%$ in the most favorable cases while $14\\%$ is expected for the least\nfavorable cases.",

    "abstract": "Online continual learning aims to learn from a non-IID stream of data from a\nnumber of different tasks, where the learner is only allowed to consider data\nonce. Methods are typically allowed to use a limited buffer to store some of\nthe images in the stream. Recently, it was found that feature replay, where an\nintermediate layer representation of the image is stored (or generated) leads\nto superior results than image replay, while requiring less memory. Quantized\nexemplars can further reduce the memory usage. However, a drawback of these\nmethods is that they use a fixed (or very intransigent) backbone network. This\nsignificantly limits the learning of representations that can discriminate\nbetween all tasks. To address this problem, we propose an auxiliary classifier\nauto-encoder (ACAE) module for feature replay at intermediate layers with high\ncompression rates. The reduced memory footprint per image allows us to save\nmore exemplars for replay.

We focus on applications where robots are required to\njointly select actions, e.g., motion primitives, to maximize team submodular\nobjectives with local communications only. Such applications are essential for\nlarge-scale multi-robot coordination such as multi-robot motion planning for\narea coverage, environment exploration, and target tracking. But the current\ndecentralized submodular maximization algorithms either require assumptions on\nthe inter-robot communication or lose some suboptimal guarantees. In this work,\nwe propose a general-purpose learning architecture towards submodular\nmaximization at scale, with decentralized communications. Particularly, our\nlearning architecture leverages a graph neural network (GNN) to capture local\ninteractions of the robots and learns decentralized decision-making for the\nrobots. We train the learning model by imitating an expert solution and\nimplement the resulting model for decentralized action selection involving\nlocal observations and communications only. We demonstrate the performance of\nour GNN-based learning approach in a scenario of active target coverage with\nlarge networks of robots. The simulation results show our approach nearly\nmatches the coverage performance of the expert algorithm, and yet runs several\norders faster with more than 30 robots.

Diverse domains such as\nnetworks and phishing have domain constraints-complex relationships between\nfeatures that an adversary must satisfy for an attack to be realized (in\naddition to any adversary-specific goals). In this paper, we explore how domain\nconstraints limit adversarial capabilities and how adversaries can adapt their\nstrategies to create realistic (constraint-compliant) examples. In this, we\ndevelop techniques to learn domain constraints from data, and show how the\nlearned constraints can be integrated into the adversarial crafting process. We\nevaluate the efficacy of our approach in network intrusion and phishing\ndatasets and find: (1) up to 82% of adversarial examples produced by\nstate-of-the-art crafting algorithms violate domain constraints, (2) domain\nconstraints are robust to adversarial examples; enforcing constraints yields an\nincrease in model accuracy by up to 34%.

Such a connection allows to build a new family of\nFR schemes for two and three-dimensional simplexes and also to recover the\nwell-known FR-SD method with tensor-product elements.

SDRT is shown to possess an enhanced temporal linear\nstability regarding the FR-DG. On the contrary, SDRT displays larger\ndissipation and dispersion errors with respect to FR-DG. Finally, the study is\nconcluded with a set of numerical experiments, the linear advection-diffusion\nproblem, the Isentropic Euler Vortex and the Taylor-Green Vortex (TGV). The\nlatter test case shows that SDRT schemes present a non-linear unstable behavior\nwith simplex elements and certain polynomial degrees.

    "abstract": "Recent research has used deep learning to develop partial differential\nequation (PDE) models in science and engineering. The functional form of the\nPDE is determined by a neural network, and the neural network parameters are\ncalibrated to available data. Calibration of the embedded neural network can be\nperformed by optimizing over the PDE. Motivated by these applications, we\nrigorously study the optimization of a class of linear elliptic PDEs with\nneural network terms. The neural network parameters in the PDE are optimized\nusing gradient descent, where the gradient is evaluated using an adjoint PDE.\nAs the number of parameters become large, the PDE and adjoint PDE converge to a\nnon-local PDE system. Using this limit PDE system, we are able to prove\nconvergence of the neural network-PDE to a global minimum during the\noptimization. The limit PDE system contains a non-local linear operator whose\neigenvalues are positive but become arbitrarily small. The lack of a spectral\ngap for the eigenvalues poses the main challenge for the global convergence\nproof. Careful analysis of the spectral decomposition of the coupled PDE and\nadjoint PDE system is required. Finally, we use this adjoint method to train a\nneural network model for an application in fluid mechanics, in which the neural\nnetwork functions as a closure model for the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes\n(RANS) equations.

Each specific\ntask consists of multiple shared feature views collected from multiple sources,\neither homogeneous or heterogeneous. Common among recent approaches is to\nemploy a typical hard/soft sharing strategy at the initial phase separately for\neach view across tasks to uncover common knowledge, underlying the assumption\nthat all views are conditionally independent. On the one hand, multiple views\nacross tasks possibly relate to each other under practical situations. On the\nother hand, supervised methods might be insufficient when labeled data is\nscarce. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel framework ASM2TV for\nsemi-supervised multi-task multi-view learning. We present a new perspective\nnamed gating control policy, a learnable task-view-interacted sharing policy\nthat adaptively selects the most desirable candidate shared block for any view\nacross any task, which uncovers more fine-grained task-view-interacted\nrelatedness and improves inference efficiency. Significantly, our proposed\ngathering consistency adaption procedure takes full advantage of large amounts\nof unlabeled fragmented time-series, making it a general framework that\naccommodates a wide range of applications. Experiments on two diverse\nreal-world HAR benchmark datasets collected from various subjects and sources\ndemonstrate our framework's superiority over other state-of-the-arts.",

    "abstract": "User response prediction, which aims to predict the probability that a user\nwill provide a predefined positive response in a given context such as clicking\non an ad or purchasing an item, is crucial to many industrial applications such\nas online advertising, recommender systems, and search ranking. However, due to\nthe high dimensionality and super sparsity of the data collected in these\ntasks, handcrafting cross features is inevitably time expensive. Prior studies\nin predicting user response leveraged the feature interactions by enhancing\nfeature vectors with products of features to model second-order or high-order\ncross features, either explicitly or implicitly. Nevertheless, these existing\nmethods can be hindered by not learning sufficient cross features due to model\narchitecture limitations or modeling all high-order feature interactions with\nequal weights. This work aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel\narchitecture Deep Cross Attentional Product Network (DCAP), which keeps cross\nnetwork's benefits in modeling high-order feature interactions explicitly at\nthe vector-wise level. Beyond that, it can differentiate the importance of\ndifferent cross features in each network layer inspired by the multi-head\nattention mechanism and Product Neural Network (PNN), allowing practitioners to\nperform a more in-depth analysis of user behaviors. Additionally, our proposed\nmodel can be easily implemented and train in parallel. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets. The results have robustly\ndemonstrated that our proposed model DCAP achieves superior prediction\nperformance compared with the state-of-the-art models.",

The combination of MOO, BBO, and PSO results in various\nmethods for optimization: vector evaluated BBO and PSO, denoted as VEBBO and\nVEPSO; and non-dominated sorting BBO and PSO, denoted as NSBBO and NSPSO. The\nmulti-objective cost function is based on tracking errors for the four states\nof the system.

    "abstract": "In many decision-making tasks, some specific actions are limited in their\nfrequency or total amounts, such as \"fire\" in the gunfight game and \"buy/sell\"\nin the stock trading. We name such actions as \"sparse action\". Sparse action\noften plays a crucial role in achieving good performance. However, their\nQ-values, estimated by \\emph{classical Bellman update}, usually suffer from a\nlarge estimation error due to the sparsity of their samples. The \\emph{greedy}\npolicy could be greatly misled by the biased Q-function and takes sparse action\naggressively, which leads to a huge sub-optimality. This paper constructs a\nreference distribution that assigns a low probability to sparse action and\nproposes a regularized objective with an explicit constraint to the reference\ndistribution. Furthermore, we derive a regularized Bellman operator and a\nregularized optimal policy that can slow down the propagation of error and\nguide the agent to take sparse action more carefully.

In order to\naddress these concerns, we conduct an extensive analysis using formalized group\nfairness metrics. We find systematic disparities in cropping and identify\ncontributing factors, including the fact that the cropping based on the single\nmost salient point can amplify the disparities. However, we demonstrate that\nformalized fairness metrics and quantitative analysis on their own are\ninsufficient for capturing the risk of representational harm in automatic\ncropping. We suggest the removal of saliency-based cropping in favor of a\nsolution that better preserves user agency.

    "abstract": "Real-time video analytics on the edge is challenging as the computationally\nconstrained resources typically cannot analyse video streams at full fidelity\nand frame rate, which results in loss of accuracy. This paper proposes a\nTransprecise Object Detector (TOD) which maximises the real-time object\ndetection accuracy on an edge device by selecting an appropriate Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN) on the fly with negligible computational overhead. TOD makes two\nkey contributions over the state of the art: (1) TOD leverages characteristics\nof the video stream such as object size and speed of movement to identify\nnetworks with high prediction accuracy for the current frames; (2) it selects\nthe best-performing network based on projected accuracy and computational\ndemand using an effective and low-overhead decision mechanism. Experimental\nevaluation on a Jetson Nano demonstrates that TOD improves the average object\ndetection precision by 34.7 % over the YOLOv4-tiny-288 model on average over\nthe MOT17Det dataset. In the MOT17-05 test dataset, TOD utilises only 45.1 % of\nGPU resource and 62.7 % of the GPU board power without losing accuracy,\ncompared to YOLOv4-416 model. We expect that TOD will maximise the application\nof edge devices to real-time object detection, since TOD maximises real-time\nobject detection accuracy given edge devices according to dynamic input\nfeatures without increasing inference latency in practice.",

This has led to the\ndevelopment of video analytics pipelines (VAPs), which reduce resource cost by\ncombining DNN compression/speedup techniques with video processing heuristics.\nOur measurement study on existing VAPs, however, shows that today's methods for\nevaluating VAPs are incomplete, often producing premature conclusions or\nambiguous results. This is because each VAP's performance varies substantially\nacross videos and time (even under the same scenario) and is sensitive to\ndifferent subsets of video content characteristics.\nWe argue that accurate VAP evaluation must first characterize the complex\ninteraction between VAPs and video characteristics, which we refer to as VAP\nperformance clarity.

Using primitive-based profiling and a carefully\ncurated benchmark video set, Yoda builds a performance clarity profile for each\nVAP to precisely define its accuracy/cost tradeoff and its relationship with\nvideo characteristics. We show that Yoda substantially improves VAP evaluations\nby (1) providing a comprehensive, transparent assessment of VAP performance and\nits dependencies on video characteristics; (2) explicitly identifying\nfine-grained VAP behaviors that were previously hidden by large performance\nvariance; and (3) revealing strengths/weaknesses among different VAPs and new\ndesign opportunities.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic data generation is an appealing approach to generate novel traffic\nscenarios in autonomous driving. However, deep learning techniques trained\nsolely on synthetic data encounter dramatic performance drops when they are\ntested on real data. Such performance drop is commonly attributed to the domain\ngap between real and synthetic data. Domain adaptation methods have been\napplied to mitigate the aforementioned domain gap. These methods achieve\nvisually appealing results, but the translated samples usually introduce\nsemantic inconsistencies. In this work, we propose a new, unsupervised,\nend-to-end domain adaptation network architecture that enables semantically\nconsistent domain adaptation between synthetic and real data.

Substantial recent work has concentrated\non making concurrent data structures durable with low overhead, by adding a\nminimal number of blocking persist operations (i.e., flushes and fences). In\nthis work we show that focusing on minimizing the number of persist\ninstructions is important, but not enough. We show that access to flushed\ncontent is of high cost due to cache invalidation in current architectures.\nGiven this finding, we present a design of the queue data structure that\nproperly takes care of minimizing blocking persist operations as well as\nminimizing access to flushed content. The proposed design outperforms\nstate-of-the-art durable queues.\nWe start by providing a durable version of the Michael Scott queue (MSQ). We\namend MSQ by adding a minimal number of persist instructions, fewer than in\navailable durable queues, and meeting the theoretical lower bound on the number\nof blocking persist operations. We then proceed with a second amendment to this\ndesign, that eliminates accesses to flushed data. Evaluation shows that the\nsecond amendment yields substantial performance improvement, outperforming the\nstate of the art and demonstrating the importance of reduced accesses to\nflushed content. The presented queues are durably linearizable and lock-free.\nFinally, we discuss the theoretical optimal number of accesses to flushed\ncontent.",

For these systems, specification and verification of spatial\nproperties play a fundamental role to understand their behaviour and to support\ntheir design. Recently, different tools and languages have been introduced to\nspecify and verify the properties of space. However, these formalisms are\nmainly based on graphs.

Our first contribution is to formalize the problem in various\nsettings, and explicitly discussing subtle aspects such as learner's randomness\nand whether (or not) adversary's attack can depend on it. We show that when the\nbudget of the adversary scales sublinearly with the sample complexity, PAC\nlearnability and certification are achievable. In contrast, when the\nadversary's budget grows linearly with the sample complexity, the adversary can\npotentially drive up the expected 0-1 loss to one. We further extend our\nresults to distribution-specific PAC learning in the same attack model and show\nthat proper learning with certification is possible for learning halfspaces\nunder Gaussian distribution. Finally, we empirically study the robustness of K\nnearest neighbour, logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron, and\nconvolutional neural network on real data sets, and test them against\ntargeted-poisoning attacks.

A learning agent interacting\nwith its environment is likely to be faced with situations requiring novel\ncombinations of existing pieces of knowledge. We hypothesize that such a\ndecomposition of knowledge is particularly relevant for being able to\ngeneralize in a systematic manner to out-of-distribution changes. To study\nthese ideas, we propose a particular training framework in which we assume that\nthe pieces of knowledge an agent needs and its reward function are stationary\nand can be re-used across tasks. An attention mechanism dynamically selects\nwhich modules can be adapted to the current task, and the parameters of the\nselected modules are allowed to change quickly as the learner is confronted\nwith variations in what it experiences, while the parameters of the attention\nmechanisms act as stable, slowly changing, meta-parameters. We focus on pieces\nof knowledge captured by an ensemble of modules sparsely communicating with\neach other via a bottleneck of attention. We find that meta-learning the\nmodular aspects of the proposed system greatly helps in achieving faster\nadaptation in a reinforcement learning setup involving navigation in a\npartially observed grid world with image-level input.

    "abstract": "Supervised deep learning has swiftly become a workhorse for accelerated MRI\nin recent years, offering state-of-the-art performance in image reconstruction\nfrom undersampled acquisitions. Training deep supervised models requires large\ndatasets of undersampled and fully-sampled acquisitions typically from a\nmatching set of subjects. Given scarce access to large medical datasets, this\nlimitation has sparked interest in unsupervised methods that reduce reliance on\nfully-sampled ground-truth data. A common framework is based on the deep image\nprior, where network-driven regularization is enforced directly during\ninference on undersampled acquisitions. Yet, canonical convolutional\narchitectures are suboptimal in capturing long-range relationships, and\nrandomly initialized networks may hamper convergence. To address these\nlimitations, here we introduce a novel unsupervised MRI reconstruction method\nbased on zero-Shot Learned Adversarial TransformERs (SLATER). SLATER embodies a\ndeep adversarial network with cross-attention transformer blocks to map noise\nand latent variables onto MR images. This unconditional network learns a\nhigh-quality MRI prior in a self-supervised encoding task. A zero-shot\nreconstruction is performed on undersampled test data, where inference is\nperformed by optimizing network parameters, latent and noise variables to\nensure maximal consistency to multi-coil MRI data.

    "abstract": "Deep learning based generative adversarial networks (GAN) can effectively\nperform image reconstruction with under-sampled MR data. In general, a large\nnumber of training samples are required to improve the reconstruction\nperformance of a certain model. However, in real clinical applications, it is\ndifficult to obtain tens of thousands of raw patient data to train the model\nsince saving k-space data is not in the routine clinical flow. Therefore,\nenhancing the generalizability of a network based on small samples is urgently\nneeded. In this study, three novel applications were explored based on parallel\nimaging combined with the GAN model (PI-GAN) and transfer learning. The model\nwas pre-trained with public Calgary brain images and then fine-tuned for use in\n(1) patients with tumors in our center; (2) different anatomies, including knee\nand liver; (3) different k-space sampling masks with acceleration factors (AFs)\nof 2 and 6. As for the brain tumor dataset, the transfer learning results could\nremove the artifacts found in PI-GAN and yield smoother brain edges. The\ntransfer learning results for the knee and liver were superior to those of the\nPI-GAN model trained with its own dataset using a smaller number of training\ncases. However, the learning procedure converged more slowly in the knee\ndatasets compared to the learning in the brain tumor datasets. The\nreconstruction performance was improved by transfer learning both in the models\nwith AFs of 2 and 6. Of these two models, the one with AF=2 showed better\nresults. The results also showed that transfer learning with the pre-trained\nmodel could solve the problem of inconsistency between the training and test\ndatasets and facilitate generalization to unseen data.",

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the output feedback boundary stabilization of\ngeneral 1-D reaction diffusion PDEs in the presence of an arbitrarily large\ninput delay. We consider the cases of Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin boundary\nconditions for the both boundary control and boundary condition. The boundary\nmeasurement takes the form of a either Dirichlet or Neumann trace. The adopted\ncontrol strategy is composed of a finite-dimensional observer estimating the\nfirst modes of the PDE coupled with a predictor to compensate the input delay.\nIn this context, we show for any arbitrary value of the input delay that the\ncontrol strategy achieves the exponential stabilization of the closed-loop\nsystem, for system trajectories evaluated in $H^1$ norm (also in $L^2$ norm in\nthe case of a Dirichlet boundary measurement), provided the dimension of the\nobserver is selected large enough. The reported proof of this result requires\nto perform both control design and stability analysis using simultaneously the\n(non-homogeneous) original version of the PDE and one of its equivalent\nhomogeneous representations.",

These models\nattempt to suppress the EEG artifacts while preserving the components related\nto the stimulus. Several experiments are performed using EEG recordings from\nsubjects listening to speech and music stimuli. In these experiments, we show\nthat the deep models improve the Pearson correlation significantly over the\nlinear methods (average absolute improvements of 7.4% in speech tasks and 29.3%\nin music tasks).

    "abstract": "Our planet is viewed by satellites through multiple sensors (e.g.,\nmulti-spectral, Lidar and SAR) and at different times. Multi-view observations\nbring us complementary information than the single one. Alternatively, there\nare common features shared between different views, such as geometry and\nsemantics. Recently, contrastive learning methods have been proposed for the\nalignment of multi-view remote sensing images and improving the feature\nrepresentation of single sensor images by modeling view-invariant factors.\nHowever, these methods are based on the pretraining of the predefined tasks or\njust focus on image-level classification. Moreover, these methods lack research\non uncertainty estimation. In this work, a pixel-wise contrastive approach\nbased on an unlabeled multi-view setting is proposed to overcome this\nlimitation. This is achieved by the use of contrastive loss in the feature\nalignment and uniformity between multi-view images. In this approach, a\npseudo-Siamese ResUnet is trained to learn a representation that aims to align\nfeatures from the shifted positive pairs and uniform the induced distribution\nof the features on the hypersphere. The learned features of multi-view remote\nsensing images are evaluated on a liner protocol evaluation and an unsupervised\nchange detection task. We analyze key properties of the approach that make it\nwork, finding that the requirement of shift equivariance ensured the success of\nthe proposed approach and the uncertainty estimation of representations leads\nto performance improvements. Moreover, the performance of multi-view\ncontrastive learning is affected by the choice of different sensors. Results\ndemonstrate both improvements in efficiency and accuracy over the\nstate-of-the-art multi-view contrastive methods.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear Auto-Regressive eXogenous input (NARX) models are a popular class\nof nonlinear dynamical models. Often a polynomial basis expansion is used to\ndescribe the internal multivariate nonlinear mapping (P-NARX). Resorting to\nfixed basis functions is convenient since it results in a closed form solution\nof the estimation problem. The drawback, however, is that the predefined basis\ndoes not necessarily lead to a sparse representation of the relationship,\ntypically resulting in very large numbers of parameters. So-called decoupling\ntechniques were specifically designed to reduce large multivariate functions.\nIt was found that, often, a more efficient parameterisation can be retrieved by\nrotating towards a new basis. Characteristic to the decoupled structure is\nthat, expressed in the new basis, the relationship is structured such that only\nsingle-input single-output nonlinear functions are required. Classical\ndecoupling techniques are unfit to deal with the case of single-output NARX\nmodels. In this work, this limitation is overcome by adopting the filtered CPD\ndecoupling method of Decuyper et al. (2021b).

The\nproposed algorithm has Scatter Index (SI), Bias, Correlation Coefficient, Root\nMean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.130, -0.002, 0.97, and 0.14, respectively, for\none day ahead prediction and 0.110, -0.001, 0.98, and 0.122, respectively, for\n14-day ahead prediction on the testing dataset. While other state-of-the-art\nmethods can only forecast up to 120 hours ahead, we extend it further to 14\ndays. This 14-day limit is not the forecasting limit, but it arises due to our\nexperiment's setup. Our proposed setup includes spectral features, hv-block\ncross-validation, and stringent QC criteria. The proposed algorithm performs\nsignificantly better than the state-of-the-art methods commonly used for\nsignificant wave height forecasting for one-day ahead prediction.

The rapid spread of COVID-19 is continuing to threaten human's life\nand health. Therefore, the development of computer-aided detection (CAD)\nsystems based on machine and deep learning methods which are able to accurately\ndifferentiate COVID-19 from other diseases using chest computed tomography (CT)\nand X-Ray datasets is essential and of immediate priority. Different from most\nof the previous studies which used either one of CT or X-ray images, we\nemployed both data types with sufficient samples in implementation. On the\nother hand, due to the extreme sensitivity of this pervasive virus, model\nuncertainty should be considered, while most previous studies have overlooked\nit.

    "abstract": "Elastic Riemannian metrics have been used successfully in the past for\nstatistical treatments of functional and curve shape data. However, this usage\nhas suffered from an important restriction: the function boundaries are assumed\nfixed and matched. Functional data exhibiting unmatched boundaries typically\narise from dynamical systems with variable evolution rates such as COVID-19\ninfection rate curves associated with different geographical regions. In this\ncase, it is more natural to model such data with sliding boundaries and use\npartial matching, i.e., only a part of a function is matched to another\nfunction. Here, we develop a comprehensive Riemannian framework that allows for\npartial matching, comparing, and clustering of functions under both phase\nvariability and uncertain boundaries. We extend past work by: (1) Forming a\njoint action of the time-warping and time-scaling groups; (2) Introducing a\nmetric that is invariant to this joint action, allowing for a gradient-based\napproach to elastic partial matching; and (3) Presenting a modification that,\nwhile losing the metric property, allows one to control relative influence of\nthe two groups. This framework is illustrated for registering and clustering\nshapes of COVID-19 rate curves, identifying essential patterns, minimizing\nmismatch errors, and reducing variability within clusters compared to previous\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "In the pharmaceutical industry, where it is common to generate many QSAR\nmodels with large numbers of molecules and descriptors, the best QSAR methods\nare those that can generate the most accurate predictions but that are also\ninsensitive to hyperparameters and are computationally efficient. Here we\ncompare Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) to random forest,\nsingle-task deep neural nets, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) on 30\nin-house data sets. While any boosting algorithm has many adjustable\nhyperparameters, we can define a set of standard hyperparameters at which\nLightGBM makes predictions about as accurate as single-task deep neural nets,\nbut is a factor of 1000-fold faster than random forest and ~4-fold faster than\nXGBoost in terms of total computational time for the largest models. Another\nvery useful feature of LightGBM is that it includes a native method for\nestimating prediction intervals.",

    "abstract": "Image denoising is one of the most critical problems in mobile photo\nprocessing. While many solutions have been proposed for this task, they are\nusually working with synthetic data and are too computationally expensive to\nrun on mobile devices. To address this problem, we introduce the first Mobile\nAI challenge, where the target is to develop an end-to-end deep learning-based\nimage denoising solution that can demonstrate high efficiency on smartphone\nGPUs. For this, the participants were provided with a novel large-scale dataset\nconsisting of noisy-clean image pairs captured in the wild. The runtime of all\nmodels was evaluated on the Samsung Exynos 2100 chipset with a powerful Mali\nGPU capable of accelerating floating-point and quantized neural networks. The\nproposed solutions are fully compatible with any mobile GPU and are capable of\nprocessing 480p resolution images under 40-80 ms while achieving high fidelity\nresults. A detailed description of all models developed in the challenge is\nprovided in this paper.",

    "abstract": "Portfolio management aims at maximizing the return on investment while\nminimizing risk by continuously reallocating the assets forming the portfolio.\nThese assets are not independent but correlated during a short time period. A\ngraph convolutional reinforcement learning framework called DeepPocket is\nproposed whose objective is to exploit the time-varying interrelations between\nfinancial instruments. These interrelations are represented by a graph whose\nnodes correspond to the financial instruments while the edges correspond to a\npair-wise correlation function in between assets. DeepPocket consists of a\nrestricted, stacked autoencoder for feature extraction, a convolutional network\nto collect underlying local information shared among financial instruments, and\nan actor-critic reinforcement learning agent. The actor-critic structure\ncontains two convolutional networks in which the actor learns and enforces an\ninvestment policy which is, in turn, evaluated by the critic in order to\ndetermine the best course of action by constantly reallocating the various\nportfolio assets to optimize the expected return on investment. The agent is\ninitially trained offline with online stochastic batching on historical data.\nAs new data become available, it is trained online with a passive concept drift\napproach to handle unexpected changes in their distributions. DeepPocket is\nevaluated against five real-life datasets over three distinct investment\nperiods, including during the Covid-19 crisis, and clearly outperformed market\nindexes.",

Here we discuss how to build an adaptive, optimal numerical basis\nthat is chosen to represent most efficiently the structural diversity of the\ndataset at hand. For each training dataset, this optimal basis is unique, and\ncan be computed at no additional cost with respect to the primitive basis by\napproximating it with splines.
