    "abstract": "Machine learning techniques are gaining attention in the context of intrusion\ndetection due to the increasing amounts of data generated by monitoring tools,\nas well as the sophistication displayed by attackers in hiding their activity.\nHowever, existing methods often exhibit important limitations in terms of the\nquantity and relevance of the generated alerts. Recently, knowledge graphs are\nfinding application in the cybersecurity domain, showing the potential to\nalleviate some of these drawbacks thanks to their ability to seamlessly\nintegrate data from multiple domains using human-understandable vocabularies.\nWe discuss the application of machine learning on knowledge graphs for\nintrusion detection and experimentally evaluate a link-prediction method for\nscoring anomalous activity in industrial systems. After initial unsupervised\ntraining, the proposed method is shown to produce intuitively well-calibrated\nand interpretable alerts in a diverse range of scenarios, hinting at the\npotential benefits of relational machine learning on knowledge graphs for\nintrusion detection purposes.",

    "title": "Learning to Act Safely with Limited Exposure and Almost Sure Certainty",
    "abstract": "This paper aims to put forward the concept that learning to take safe actions\nin unknown environments, even with probability one guarantees, can be achieved\nwithout the need for an unbounded number of exploratory trials, provided that\none is willing to navigate trade-offs between optimality, level of exposure to\nunsafe events, and the maximum detection time of unsafe actions. We illustrate\nthis concept in two complementary settings. We first focus on the canonical\nmulti-armed bandit problem and seek to study the intrinsic trade-offs of\nlearning safety in the presence of uncertainty. Under mild assumptions on\nsufficient exploration, we provide an algorithm that provably detects all\nunsafe machines in an (expected) finite number of rounds. The analysis also\nunveils a trade-off between the number of rounds needed to secure the\nenvironment and the probability of discarding safe machines. We then consider\nthe problem of finding optimal policies for a Markov Decision Process (MDP)\nwith almost sure constraints. We show that the (action) value function\nsatisfies a barrier-based decomposition which allows for the identification of\nfeasible policies independently of the reward process. Using this\ndecomposition, we develop a Barrier-learning algorithm, that identifies such\nunsafe state-action pairs in a finite expected number of steps. Our analysis\nfurther highlights a trade-off between the time lag for the underlying MDP\nnecessary to detect unsafe actions, and the level of exposure to unsafe events.\nSimulations corroborate our theoretical findings, further illustrating the\naforementioned trade-offs, and suggesting that safety constraints can further\nspeed up the learning process.",

Given one or more previous visual observations, Pathdreamer\ngenerates plausible high-resolution 360 visual observations (RGB, semantic\nsegmentation and depth) for viewpoints that have not been visited, in buildings\nnot seen during training. In regions of high uncertainty (e.g. predicting\naround corners, imagining the contents of an unseen room), Pathdreamer can\npredict diverse scenes, allowing an agent to sample multiple realistic outcomes\nfor a given trajectory. We demonstrate that Pathdreamer encodes useful and\naccessible visual, spatial and semantic knowledge about human environments by\nusing it in the downstream task of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN).\nSpecifically, we show that planning ahead with Pathdreamer brings about half\nthe benefit of looking ahead at actual observations from unobserved parts of\nthe environment.

    "abstract": "Network intervention problems often benefit from selecting a highly-connected\nnode to perform interventions using these nodes, e.g. immunization. However, in\nmany network contexts, the structure of network connections is unknown, leading\nto a challenge. We develop and examine the mathematical properties of two\ndistinct informationally light strategies, a novel global strategy and local\nstrategy, that yield higher degree nodes in virtually any network structure. We\nfurther identify a novel network property called Inversity, whose sign\ndetermines which of the two strategies, local or global, will be most effective\nfor a network. We demonstrate that local and global strategies obtain a\nseveral-fold improvement in node degree relative to a random selection\nbenchmark for generated and real networks (including contact, affiliation and\nonline networks). In some networks, they achieve a 100-fold improvement. We\nshow how these new strategies can be used to control contagion of an epidemic\nspreading across a set of village networks, finding that the strategies\ndeveloped here require far fewer ($<50\\%$) nodes to be immunized, relative to\nthe random strategy baseline. Prior research has typically used the complete\nnetwork structure to choose nodes for optimal seeding. The relevant network is\noften costly to collect, and is privacy-invasive, requiring knowing each\nperson's network neighbors, and might not be possible to obtain for\ntime-sensitive interventions. Our interventions are less invasive of individual\nprivacy, since each selected node only needs to nominate some network neighbors\nfor intervention, while mathematically guaranteed to provide better connected\nnodes.",

This paper\npresents an extensible, high performance framework (namedOpenGraphGym-MG) that\nuses deep reinforcement learning and graph embedding to solve large graph\noptimization problems with multiple GPUs. The paper uses a common RL algorithm\n(deep Q-learning) and a representative graph embedding (structure2vec) to\ndemonstrate the extensibility of the framework and, most importantly, to\nillustrate the novel optimization techniques, such as spatial parallelism,\ngraph-level and node-level batched processing, distributed sparse graph\nstorage, efficient parallel RL training and inference algorithms, repeated\ngradient descent iterations, and adaptive multiple-node selections. This study\nperforms a comprehensive performance analysis on parallel efficiency and memory\ncost that proves the parallel RL training and inference algorithms are\nefficient and highly scalable on a number of GPUs. This study also conducts a\nrange of large graph experiments, with both generated graphs (over 30 million\nedges) and real-world graphs, using a single compute node (with six GPUs) of\nthe Summit supercomputer. Good scalability in both RL training and inference is\nachieved: as the number of GPUs increases from one to six, the time of a single\nstep of RL training and a single step of RL inference on large graphs with more\nthan 30 million edges, is reduced from 316.4s to 54.5s, and 23.8s to 3.4s,\nrespectively.

Here, nodes are deployed uniformly in a square area around the origin,\nand any two nodes which are within Euclidean distance of $1$ are assumed to be\nable to receive each other's broadcast. A source node at the origin encodes $k$\ndata packets of information into $n\\ (>k)$ coded packets and transmits them to\nall its one-hop neighbors. The encoding is such that, any node that receives at\nleast $k$ out of the $n$ coded packets can retrieve the original $k$ data\npackets. Every other node in the network follows a probabilistic forwarding\nprotocol; upon reception of a previously unreceived packet, the node forwards\nit with probability $p$ and does nothing with probability $1-p$. We are\ninterested in the minimum forwarding probability which ensures that a large\nfraction of nodes can decode the information from the source. We deem this a\n\\emph{near-broadcast}. The performance metric of interest is the expected total\nnumber of transmissions at this minimum forwarding probability, where the\nexpectation is over both the forwarding protocol as well as the realization of\nthe RGG.

Our baseline achieves $86.36\\%$ top-1\nclassification accuracy on CUB-200-2011 dataset by utilizing random crop\naugmentation during training and center crop augmentation during testing. In\nthis work, we explore the usefulness of various pretext tasks, specifically,\nrotation, pretext invariant representation learning (PIRL), and deconstruction\nand construction learning (DCL) for FGVC. Rotation as an auxiliary task\npromotes the model to learn global features, and diverts it from focusing on\nthe subtle details. PIRL that uses jigsaw patches attempts to focus on\ndiscriminative local regions, but struggles to accurately localize them. DCL\nhelps in learning local discriminating features and outperforms the baseline by\nachieving $87.41\\%$ top-1 accuracy. The deconstruction learning forces the\nmodel to focus on local object parts, while reconstruction learning helps in\nlearning the correlation between the parts. We perform extensive experiments to\nreason our findings. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/mmaaz60/ssl_for_fgvc.",

    "abstract": "Success in Open Source Software (OSS) is often perceived as an exclusively\ncode-centric endeavor. This perception can exclude a variety of individuals\nwith a diverse set of skills and backgrounds, in turn helping create the\ncurrent diversity \\& inclusion imbalance in OSS. Because people's perspectives\nof success affect their personal, professional, and life choices, to be able to\nsupport a diverse class of individuals, we must first understand what OSS\ncontributors consider successful. Thus far, research has used a\nuni-dimensional, code-centric lens to define success. In this paper, we\nchallenge this status-quo and reveal the multi-faceted definition of success\namong OSS contributors. We do so through interviews with 27 OSS contributors\nwho are recognized as successful in their communities, and a follow-up open\nsurvey with 193 OSS contributors. Our study provides nuanced definitions of\nsuccess perceptions in OSS, which might help devise strategies to attract and\nretain a diverse set of contributors, helping them attain their \"pots of gold\nat the end of the rainbow\".",

    "abstract": "Large ride-hailing platforms, such as DiDi, Uber and Lyft, connect tens of\nthousands of vehicles in a city to millions of ride demands throughout the day,\nproviding great promises for improving transportation efficiency through the\ntasks of order dispatching and vehicle repositioning. Existing studies,\nhowever, usually consider the two tasks in simplified settings that hardly\naddress the complex interactions between the two, the real-time fluctuations\nbetween supply and demand, and the necessary coordinations due to the\nlarge-scale nature of the problem. In this paper we propose a unified\nvalue-based dynamic learning framework (V1D3) for tackling both tasks. At the\ncenter of the framework is a globally shared value function that is updated\ncontinuously using online experiences generated from real-time platform\ntransactions. To improve the sample-efficiency and the robustness, we further\npropose a novel periodic ensemble method combining the fast online learning\nwith a large-scale offline training scheme that leverages the abundant\nhistorical driver trajectory data. This allows the proposed framework to adapt\nquickly to the highly dynamic environment, to generalize robustly to recurrent\npatterns and to drive implicit coordinations among the population of managed\nvehicles. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets show considerably\nimprovements over other recently proposed methods on both tasks. Particularly,\nV1D3 outperforms the first prize winners of both dispatching and repositioning\ntracks in the KDD Cup 2020 RL competition, achieving state-of-the-art results\non improving both total driver income and user experience related metrics.",

Numerous branches of works\nhave been proposed to alleviate the complication and have demonstrated their\nefficiencies. In particular, self-supervised learning based methods are\nspurring interest due to their capability of learning diverse representations\nwithout additional labels. Among self-supervised learning tactics, contrastive\nlearning is one specific framework validating their superiority in various\nfields, including anomaly detection. However, the primary objective of\ncontrastive learning is to learn task-agnostic features without any labels,\nwhich is not entirely suited to discern anomalies. In this paper, we propose a\ntask-specific variant of contrastive learning named masked contrastive\nlearning, which is more befitted for anomaly detection. Moreover, we propose a\nnew inference method dubbed self-ensemble inference that further boosts\nperformance by leveraging the ability learned through auxiliary\nself-supervision tasks.

    "abstract": "Billions of photos are uploaded to the web daily through various types of\nsocial networks. Some of these images receive millions of views and become\npopular, whereas others remain completely unnoticed. This raises the problem of\npredicting image popularity on social media. The popularity of an image can be\naffected by several factors, such as visual content, aesthetic quality, user,\npost metadata, and time. Thus, considering all these factors is essential for\naccurately predicting image popularity. In addition, the efficiency of the\npredictive model also plays a crucial role. In this study, motivated by\nmultimodal learning, which uses information from various modalities, and the\ncurrent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in various fields, we\npropose a deep learning model, called visual-social convolutional neural\nnetwork (VSCNN), which predicts the popularity of a posted image by\nincorporating various types of visual and social features into a unified\nnetwork model. VSCNN first learns to extract high-level representations from\nthe input visual and social features by utilizing two individual CNNs. The\noutputs of these two networks are then fused into a joint network to estimate\nthe popularity score in the output layer. We assess the performance of the\nproposed method by conducting extensive experiments on a dataset of\napproximately 432K images posted on Flickr. The simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed VSCNN model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels, with a relative improvement of greater than 2.33%, 7.59%, and 14.16% in\nterms of Spearman's Rho, mean absolute error, and mean squared error,\nrespectively.",

Our participants,\nonline extremist accounts, are 4,876 public Facebook pages or groups that have\nshared information from the websites of 289 Southern Poverty Law Center\ndesignated extremist groups. By clustering the quantitative features followed\nby qualitative expert validation, we identify five roles surrounding extremist\nactivism: educators, solicitors, flamers, motivators, sympathizers. For\nexample, solicitors use links from extremist websites to attract donations and\nparticipation in extremist issues, whereas flamers share inflammatory extremist\ncontent inciting anger. We further investigate role dynamics such as, how\nstable these roles are over time and how likely will extremist accounts\ntransition from one role into another. We find that roles core to the movement,\neducators and solicitors, are more stable, while flamers and motivators can\ntransition to sympathizers with high probability. We further find that\neducators and solicitors exert the most influence in triggering extremist link\nposts, whereas flamers are influential in triggering the spread of information\nfrom fake news sources. Our results help in situating various roles on the\ntrajectory of deeper engagement into the extremist movements and understanding\nthe potential effect of various counter extremism interventions. Our findings\nhave implications for understanding how online extremist movements flourish\nthrough participatory activism and how they gain a spectrum of allies for\nmobilizing extremism online.",

Once trained, LEA uses sample data and statistics (such as\ncardinality) from the user's database to predict the optimal column encodings.\nLEA can optimize for encoded size, query performance, or a combination of the\ntwo.

    "abstract": "Many real-world domains are subject to a structured non-stationarity which\naffects the agent's goals and the environmental dynamics. Meta-reinforcement\nlearning (RL) has been shown successful for training agents that quickly adapt\nto related tasks. However, most of the existing meta-RL algorithms for\nnon-stationary domains either make strong assumptions on the task generation\nprocess or require sampling from it at training time. In this paper, we propose\na novel algorithm (TRIO) that optimizes for the future by explicitly tracking\nthe task evolution through time. At training time, TRIO learns a variational\nmodule to quickly identify latent parameters from experience samples. This\nmodule is learned jointly with an optimal exploration policy that takes task\nuncertainty into account. At test time, TRIO tracks the evolution of the latent\nparameters online, hence reducing the uncertainty over future tasks and\nobtaining fast adaptation through the meta-learned policy. Unlike most existing\nmethods, TRIO does not assume Markovian task-evolution processes, it does not\nrequire information about the non-stationarity at training time, and it\ncaptures complex changes undergoing in the environment. We evaluate our\nalgorithm on different simulated problems and show it outperforms competitive\nbaselines.",

We propose rx-anon, an anonymization approach for\nheterogeneous semi-structured documents composed of relational and textual\nattributes.

This allows us to use concepts like k-anonymity to generate a joined,\nprivacy-preserved version of the heterogeneous data input. We introduce the\nconcept of redundant sensitive information to consistently anonymize the\nheterogeneous data. To control the influence of anonymization over unstructured\ntextual data versus structured data attributes, we introduce a modified,\nparameterized Mondrian algorithm. The parameter $\\lambda$ allows to give\ndifferent weight on the relational and textual attributes during the\nanonymization process. We evaluate our approach with two real-world datasets\nusing a Normalized Certainty Penalty score, adapted to the problem of jointly\nanonymizing relational and textual data. The results show that our approach is\ncapable of reducing information loss by using the tuning parameter to control\nthe Mondrian partitioning while guaranteeing k-anonymity for relational\nattributes as well as for sensitive terms.

    "abstract": "A high-order quadrature algorithm is presented for computing integrals over\ncurved surfaces and volumes whose geometry is implicitly defined by the level\nsets of (one or more) multivariate polynomials. The algorithm recasts the\nimplicitly defined geometry as the graph of an implicitly defined, multi-valued\nheight function, and applies a dimension reduction approach needing only\none-dimensional quadrature. In particular, we explore the use of Gauss-Legendre\nand tanh-sinh methods and demonstrate that the quadrature algorithm inherits\ntheir high-order convergence rates. Under the action of $h$-refinement with $q$\nfixed, the quadrature schemes yield an order of accuracy of $2q$, where $q$ is\nthe one-dimensional node count; numerical experiments demonstrate up to 22nd\norder. Under the action of $q$-refinement with the geometry fixed, the\nconvergence is approximately exponential, i.e., doubling $q$ approximately\ndoubles the number of accurate digits of the computed integral. Complex\ngeometry is automatically handled by the algorithm, including, e.g.,\nmulti-component domains, tunnels, and junctions arising from multiple\npolynomial level sets, as well as self-intersections, cusps, and other kinds of\nsingularities. A variety of accompanying numerical experiments demonstrates the\nquadrature algorithm on two- and three-dimensional problems, including randomly\ngenerated geometry involving multiple high curvature pieces; challenging\nexamples involving high degree singularities such as cusps; adaptation to\nsimplex constraint cells in addition to hyper-rectangular constraint cells; and\nboolean operations to compute integrals on overlapping domains.",

    "abstract": "When encountering a dubious diagnostic case, medical instance retrieval can\nhelp radiologists make evidence-based diagnoses by finding images containing\ninstances similar to a query case from a large image database. The similarity\nbetween the query case and retrieved similar cases is determined by visual\nfeatures extracted from pathologically abnormal regions. However, the\nmanifestation of these regions often lacks specificity, i.e., different\ndiseases can have the same manifestation, and different manifestations may\noccur at different stages of the same disease. To combat the manifestation\nambiguity in medical instance retrieval, we propose a novel deep framework\ncalled Y-Net, encoding images into compact hash-codes generated from\nconvolutional features by feature aggregation. Y-Net can learn highly\ndiscriminative convolutional features by unifying the pixel-wise segmentation\nloss and classification loss. The segmentation loss allows exploring subtle\nspatial differences for good spatial-discriminability while the classification\nloss utilizes class-aware semantic information for good semantic-separability.\nAs a result, Y-Net can enhance the visual features in pathologically abnormal\nregions and suppress the disturbing of the background during model training,\nwhich could effectively embed discriminative features into the hash-codes in\nthe retrieval stage. Extensive experiments on two medical image datasets\ndemonstrate that Y-Net can alleviate the ambiguity of pathologically abnormal\nregions and its retrieval performance outperforms the state-of-the-art method\nby an average of 9.27\\% on the returned list of 10.",

In this paper, we investigate the problem of the\nabove three FDI attacks against dynamic power state estimation (DSE). In this\nresearch, we propose two robust defense approaches against the above three\nefficient FDI attacks on DSE. Compared to existing approaches, our proposed\napproaches have three major differences and significant strengths: (1) they\ndefend against the three FDI attacks on dynamic power state estimation rather\nthan static power state estimation, (2) they give a robust estimator that can\naccurately extract a subset of attack-free sensors for power state estimation,\nand (3) they adopt the little-known Mahalanobis distance in the consistency\ncheck of power sensor measurements, which is different from the Euclidean\ndistance used in all the existing studies on power state estimation. We\nmathematically prove that the Mahalanobis distance is not only useful but also\nmuch better than the Euclidean distance in the consistency check of power\nsensor measurements. Our time complexity analysis shows that the proposed two\nrobust defense approaches are efficient. Moreover, to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approaches, we compare them with the three\nwell-known approaches: the least square approach, the Imhotep-SMT approach, and\nthe MEE-UKF approach. Experiments show that the proposed approaches further\nreduce the estimation error by two orders of magnitude and four orders of\nmagnitude compared to the Imhotep-SMT approach and the least square approach,\nrespectively.

To evaluate its\nutility, we use the mixed training set to train the ResNet50, VGG16,\nInceptionV3 and DenseNet121 models on the WIKI dataset and the CNBC face\ndataset. Experimental findings on the testing set show that our scheme\npreserves image privacy while maintaining the availability of the training set\nin the deep learning models. Additionally, the experimental results demonstrate\nthat we achieve good performance for the VGG16 model on the WIKI dataset and\nboth ResNet50 and DenseNet121 on the CNBC dataset. The pixel block algorithm\nachieves fairly high efficiency in the mixing of the images, and it is\ncomputationally challenging for the attackers to restore the mixed training set\nto the original training set. Moreover, data augmentation can be applied to the\nmixed training set to improve the training's effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Optimal stopping is the problem of deciding the right time at which to take a\nparticular action in a stochastic system, in order to maximize an expected\nreward. It has many applications in areas such as finance, healthcare, and\nstatistics. In this paper, we employ deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn\noptimal stopping policies in two financial engineering applications: namely\noption pricing, and optimal option exercise. We present for the first time a\ncomprehensive empirical evaluation of the quality of optimal stopping policies\nidentified by three state of the art deep RL algorithms: double deep Q-learning\n(DDQN), categorical distributional RL (C51), and Implicit Quantile Networks\n(IQN). In the case of option pricing, our findings indicate that in a\ntheoretical Black-Schole environment, IQN successfully identifies nearly\noptimal prices. On the other hand, it is slightly outperformed by C51 when\nconfronted to real stock data movements in a put option exercise problem that\ninvolves assets from the S&P500 index. More importantly, the C51 algorithm is\nable to identify an optimal stopping policy that achieves 8% more out-of-sample\nreturns than the best of four natural benchmark policies. We conclude with a\ndiscussion of our findings which should pave the way for relevant future\nresearch.",

    "abstract": "We study two classes of summary-based cardinality estimators that use\nstatistics about input relations and small-size joins in the context of graph\ndatabase management systems: (i) optimistic estimators that make uniformity and\nconditional independence assumptions; and (ii) the recent pessimistic\nestimators that use information theoretic linear programs. We begin by\naddressing the problem of how to make accurate estimates for optimistic\nestimators. We model these estimators as picking bottom-to-top paths in a\ncardinality estimation graph (CEG), which contains sub-queries as nodes and\nweighted edges between sub-queries that represent average degrees. We outline a\nspace of heuristics to make an optimistic estimate in this framework and show\nthat effective heuristics depend on the structure of the input queries. We\nobserve that on acyclic queries and queries with small-size cycles, using the\nmaximum-weight path is an effective technique to address the well known\nunderestimation problem for optimistic estimators. We show that on a large\nsuite of datasets and workloads, the accuracy of such estimates is up to three\norders of magnitude more accurate in mean q-error than some prior heuristics\nthat have been proposed in prior work. In contrast, we show that on queries\nwith larger cycles these estimators tend to overestimate, which can partially\nbe addressed by using minimum weight paths and more effectively by using an\nalternative CEG. We then show that CEGs can also model the recent pessimistic\nestimators. This surprising result allows us to connect two disparate lines of\nwork on optimistic and pessimistic estimators, adopt an optimization from\npessimistic estimators to optimistic ones, and provide insights into the\npessimistic estimators, such as showing that there are alternative\ncombinatorial solutions to the linear programs that define them.",

Using results of human satisfaction, we further\nsummarize four most frequently appeared bad disentanglement cases on\nsoftware-related chat to insight future improvements. These cases include (i)\nignoring interaction patterns; (ii) ignoring contextual information; (iii)\nmixing up topics; and (iv) ignoring user relationships.

This paper introduces a new\ncontinuous chaotic system along with its corresponding implementation, which\ntargets field-programmable gate array (FPGA). This chaotic system has five\ndimensions, which exhibit complex chaotic dynamics, thus enabling the\nutilization of chaotic signals in cryptography. A mathematical analysis is\npresented to demonstrate the dynamic characteristics of the proposed\nhyperchaotic system. A novel digital implementation of the proposed system is\npresented.

Lightning Network (LN), which was introduced\nmuch later, solves most of these problems with an innovative concept called\noff-chain payments. With this advancement, Bitcoin has become an attractive\nvenue to perform micro-payments which can also be adopted in many IoT\napplications (e.g. toll payments). Nevertheless, it is not feasible to host LN\nand Bitcoin on IoT devices due to the storage, memory, and processing\nrequirements. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient and secure\nprotocol that enables an IoT device to use LN through an untrusted gateway\nnode. The gateway hosts LN and Bitcoin nodes, and can open & close LN channels,\nsend LN payments on behalf of the IoT device. This delegation approach is\npowered by a (2,2)-threshold scheme that requires the IoT device and the LN\ngateway to jointly perform all LN operations which in turn secures both\nparties' funds. Specifically, we propose to thresholdize LN's Bitcoin public\nand private keys as well as its commitment points. With these and several other\nprotocol level changes, IoT device is protected against revoked state\nbroadcast, collusion and ransom attacks. We implemented the proposed protocol\nby changing LN's source code and thoroughly evaluated its performance using a\nRaspberry Pi.

Recent deep learning-based models that exploit\nfeature embedding and high-order data nonlinearity have shown dramatic\nsuccesses in CTR prediction. However, these models work poorly on cold-start\nads with new IDs, whose embeddings are not well learned yet. In this paper, we\npropose Graph Meta Embedding (GME) models that can rapidly learn how to\ngenerate desirable initial embeddings for new ad IDs based on graph neural\nnetworks and meta learning. Previous works address this problem from the new ad\nitself, but ignore possibly useful information contained in existing old ads.\nIn contrast, GMEs simultaneously consider two information sources: the new ad\nand existing old ads. For the new ad, GMEs exploit its associated attributes.\nFor existing old ads, GMEs first build a graph to connect them with new ads,\nand then adaptively distill useful information. We propose three specific GMEs\nfrom different perspectives to explore what kind of information to use and how\nto distill information. In particular, GME-P uses Pre-trained neighbor ID\nembeddings, GME-G uses Generated neighbor ID embeddings and GME-A uses neighbor\nAttributes. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that GMEs\ncan significantly improve the prediction performance in both cold-start (i.e.,\nno training data is available) and warm-up (i.e., a small number of training\nsamples are collected) scenarios over five major deep learning-based CTR\nprediction models.

Extensively experimental\nresults on two public medical VQA datasets show that our approach achieves\nsuperior accuracy in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, while does\nnot require external data to train meta-models.",

    "abstract": "Learning behavior mechanism is widely anticipated in managed settings through\nthe formal syllabus. However, heading for learning stimulus whilst daily\nmobility practices through urban transit is the novel feature in learning\nsciences. Theory of planned behavior (TPB), technology acceptance model (TAM),\nand service quality of transit are conceptualized to assess the learning\nbehavioral intention (LBI) of commuters in Greater Kuala Lumpur. An online\nsurvey was conducted to understand the LBI of 117 travelers who use the\ntechnology to engage in the informal learning process during daily commuting.\nThe results explored that all the model variables i.e., perceived ease of use,\nperceived usefulness, service quality, and subjective norms are significant\npredictors of LBI. The perceived usefulness of learning during traveling and\ntransit service quality has a vibrant impact on LBI. The research will support\nthe informal learning mechanism from commuters point of view. The study is a\nnovel contribution to transport and learning literature that will open the new\nprospect of research in urban mobility and its connotation with personal\nlearning and development.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD), transferring knowledge from a cumbersome teacher\nmodel to a lightweight student model, has been investigated to design efficient\nneural architectures. Generally, the objective function of KD is the\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss between the softened probability\ndistributions of the teacher model and the student model with the temperature\nscaling hyperparameter tau. Despite its widespread use, few studies have\ndiscussed the influence of such softening on generalization. Here, we\ntheoretically show that the KL divergence loss focuses on the logit matching\nwhen tau increases and the label matching when tau goes to 0 and empirically\nshow that the logit matching is positively correlated to performance\nimprovement in general. From this observation, we consider an intuitive KD loss\nfunction, the mean squared error (MSE) between the logit vectors, so that the\nstudent model can directly learn the logit of the teacher model. The MSE loss\noutperforms the KL divergence loss, explained by the difference in the\npenultimate layer representations between the two losses. Furthermore, we show\nthat sequential distillation can improve performance and that KD, particularly\nwhen using the KL divergence loss with small tau, mitigates the label noise.\nThe code to reproduce the experiments is publicly available online at\nhttps://github.com/jhoon-oh/kd_data/.",

    "abstract": "Automatic metrics are essential for developing natural language generation\n(NLG) models, particularly for open-ended language generation tasks such as\nstory generation. However, existing automatic metrics are observed to correlate\npoorly with human evaluation. The lack of standardized benchmark datasets makes\nit difficult to fully evaluate the capabilities of a metric and fairly compare\ndifferent metrics. Therefore, we propose OpenMEVA, a benchmark for evaluating\nopen-ended story generation metrics. OpenMEVA provides a comprehensive test\nsuite to assess the capabilities of metrics, including (a) the correlation with\nhuman judgments, (b) the generalization to different model outputs and\ndatasets, (c) the ability to judge story coherence, and (d) the robustness to\nperturbations. To this end, OpenMEVA includes both manually annotated stories\nand auto-constructed test examples. We evaluate existing metrics on OpenMEVA\nand observe that they have poor correlation with human judgments, fail to\nrecognize discourse-level incoherence, and lack inferential knowledge (e.g.,\ncausal order between events), the generalization ability and robustness. Our\nstudy presents insights for developing NLG models and metrics in further\nresearch.",

    "abstract": "Patients with severe Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) typically require\nsupplemental oxygen as an essential treatment. We developed a machine learning\nalgorithm, based on a deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), for continuous\nmanagement of oxygen flow rate for critical ill patients under intensive care,\nwhich can identify the optimal personalized oxygen flow rate with strong\npotentials to reduce mortality rate relative to the current clinical practice.\nBasically, we modeled the oxygen flow trajectory of COVID-19 patients and their\nhealth outcomes as a Markov decision process. Based on individual patient\ncharacteristics and health status, a reinforcement learning based oxygen\ncontrol policy is learned and real-time recommends the oxygen flow rate to\nreduce the mortality rate. We assessed the performance of proposed methods\nthrough cross validation by using a retrospective cohort of 1,372 critically\nill patients with COVID-19 from New York University Langone Health ambulatory\ncare with electronic health records from April 2020 to January 2021. The mean\nmortality rate under the RL algorithm is lower than standard of care by 2.57%\n(95% CI: 2.08- 3.06) reduction (P<0.001) from 7.94% under the standard of care\nto 5.37 % under our algorithm and the averaged recommended oxygen flow rate is\n1.28 L/min (95% CI: 1.14-1.42) lower than the rate actually delivered to\npatients. Thus, the RL algorithm could potentially lead to better intensive\ncare treatment that can reduce mortality rate, while saving the oxygen scarce\nresources. It can reduce the oxygen shortage issue and improve public health\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "With the promulgation of data protection laws (e.g., GDPR in 2018), privacy\npreservation has become a general agreement in applications where cross-domain\nsensitive data are utilized. Out of many privacy-preserving techniques,\nfederated learning (FL) has received much attention as a bridge for secure data\nconnection and cooperation. Although FL's research works have surged, some\nclassical data modeling methods are not well accommodated in FL. In this paper,\nwe propose the first masking-based federated singular vector decomposition\nmethod, called FedSVD. FedSVD protects the raw data through a singular value\ninvariance mask, which can be further removed from the SVD results. Compared\nwith prior privacy-preserving SVD solutions, FedSVD has lossless results, high\nconfidentiality, and excellent scalability. We provide privacy proof showing\nthat FedSVD has guaranteed data confidentiality. Empirical experiments on\nreal-life datasets and synthetic data have verified the effectiveness of our\nmethod. The reconstruction error of FedSVD is around 0.000001% of the raw data,\nvalidating the lossless property of FedSVD. The scalability of FedSVD is nearly\nthe same as the standalone SVD algorithm.

    "abstract": "Recent facial image synthesis methods have been mainly based on conditional\ngenerative models. Sketch-based conditions can effectively describe the\ngeometry of faces, including the contours of facial components, hair\nstructures, as well as salient edges (e.g., wrinkles) on face surfaces but lack\neffective control of appearance, which is influenced by color, material,\nlighting condition, etc. To have more control of generated results, one\npossible approach is to apply existing disentangling works to disentangle face\nimages into geometry and appearance representations. However, existing\ndisentangling methods are not optimized for human face editing, and cannot\nachieve fine control of facial details such as wrinkles. To address this issue,\nwe propose DeepFaceEditing, a structured disentanglement framework specifically\ndesigned for face images to support face generation and editing with\ndisentangled control of geometry and appearance. We adopt a local-to-global\napproach to incorporate the face domain knowledge: local component images are\ndecomposed into geometry and appearance representations, which are fused\nconsistently using a global fusion module to improve generation quality. We\nexploit sketches to assist in extracting a better geometry representation,\nwhich also supports intuitive geometry editing via sketching. The resulting\nmethod can either extract the geometry and appearance representations from face\nimages, or directly extract the geometry representation from face sketches.\nSuch representations allow users to easily edit and synthesize face images,\nwith decoupled control of their geometry and appearance. Both qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations show the superior detail and appearance control\nabilities of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress in\nrecent years. However, the large volume of intermediate results generated\nduring inference poses a significant challenge to the accelerator design for\nresource-constraint FPGA. Due to the limited on-chip storage, partial results\nof intermediate layers are frequently transferred back and forth between\non-chip memory and off-chip DRAM, leading to a non-negligible increase in\nlatency and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose block convolution, a\nhardware-friendly, simple, yet efficient convolution operation that can\ncompletely avoid the off-chip transfer of intermediate feature maps at\nrun-time. The fundamental idea of block convolution is to eliminate the\ndependency of feature map tiles in the spatial dimension when spatial tiling is\nused, which is realized by splitting a feature map into independent blocks so\nthat convolution can be performed separately on individual blocks. We conduct\nextensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed block\nconvolution on both the algorithm side and the hardware side. Specifically, we\nevaluate block convolution on 1) VGG-16, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and MobileNet-V1\nfor ImageNet classification task; 2) SSD, FPN for COCO object detection task,\nand 3) VDSR for Set5 single image super-resolution task. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that comparable or higher accuracy can be achieved with block\nconvolution. We also showcase two CNN accelerators via algorithm/hardware\nco-design based on block convolution on memory-limited FPGAs, and evaluation\nshows that both accelerators substantially outperform the baseline without\noff-chip transfer of intermediate feature maps.",

Therefore, fault diagnosis of PV arrays is indispensable\nfor improving the reliability, efficiency, productivity and safety of PV power\nstations. Instead of conventional thresholding methods and artificial\nintelligent (AI) machine learning approaches, an innovative Gaussian Mixture\nModel (GMM) based fault detection approach is proposed in this work. This\napproach combines the superiority of GMM in modeling stochastic power outputs\nof PV modules and the flexibility and simplicity of Sandia PV Array Performance\nModel (SPAM) to accurately detect under-performing modules. Firstly, GMM is\nproposed to represent the probabilistic distribution functions (PDF) of\ndifferent PV modules' power outputs, and the parameter sets of which are\nobtained by Expectation Maximization algorithm. Secondly, a simplified explicit\nexpression for output power of PV modules, which highlights the influences of\ntilt and azimuth angles, is deduced based on the SPAM. Then, an orientation\nindependent vector C is developed to eliminate the probability distribution\ndifferences of power outputs caused by varying azimuth angles and tilt angles.\nJensen-Shannon (JS) divergence, which captures the differences between\nprobability density of C of each PV module, are generated and used as fault\nindicators. Simulation data acquired from the original SPAM are used to assess\nthe performance of the proposed approach. Results show that the proposed\napproach successfully detects faults in PV systems.

    "abstract": "As the applications of deep learning models on edge devices increase at an\naccelerating pace, fast adaptation to various scenarios with varying resource\nconstraints has become a crucial aspect of model deployment. As a result, model\noptimization strategies with adaptive configuration are becoming increasingly\npopular. While single-shot quantized neural architecture search enjoys\nflexibility in both model architecture and quantization policy, the combined\nsearch space comes with many challenges, including instability when training\nthe weight-sharing supernet and difficulty in navigating the exponentially\ngrowing search space. Existing methods tend to either limit the architecture\nsearch space to a small set of options or limit the quantization policy search\nspace to fixed precision policies. To this end, we propose BatchQuant, a robust\nquantizer formulation that allows fast and stable training of a compact,\nsingle-shot, mixed-precision, weight-sharing supernet. We employ BatchQuant to\ntrain a compact supernet (offering over $10^{76}$ quantized subnets) within\nsubstantially fewer GPU hours than previous methods. Our approach,\nQuantized-for-all (QFA), is the first to seamlessly extend one-shot\nweight-sharing NAS supernet to support subnets with arbitrary ultra-low\nbitwidth mixed-precision quantization policies without retraining. QFA opens up\nnew possibilities in joint hardware-aware neural architecture search and\nquantization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on ImageNet and\nachieve SOTA Top-1 accuracy under a low complexity constraint ($<20$ MFLOPs).\nThe code and models will be made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/bhpfelix/QFA.",

    "abstract": "True random number generators (TRNG) sample random physical processes to\ncreate large amounts of random numbers for various use cases, including\nsecurity-critical cryptographic primitives, scientific simulations, machine\nlearning applications, and even recreational entertainment. Unfortunately, not\nevery computing system is equipped with dedicated TRNG hardware, limiting the\napplication space and security guarantees for such systems. To open the\napplication space and enable security guarantees for the overwhelming majority\nof computing systems that do not necessarily have dedicated TRNG hardware, we\ndevelop QUAC-TRNG.\nQUAC-TRNG exploits the new observation that a carefully-engineered sequence\nof DRAM commands activates four consecutive DRAM rows in rapid succession. This\nQUadruple ACtivation (QUAC) causes the bitline sense amplifiers to\nnon-deterministically converge to random values when we activate four rows that\nstore conflicting data because the net deviation in bitline voltage fails to\nmeet reliable sensing margins.\nWe experimentally demonstrate that QUAC reliably generates random values\nacross 136 commodity DDR4 DRAM chips from one major DRAM manufacturer. We\ndescribe how to develop an effective TRNG (QUAC-TRNG) based on QUAC. We\nevaluate the quality of our TRNG using NIST STS and find that QUAC-TRNG\nsuccessfully passes each test. Our experimental evaluations show that QUAC-TRNG\ngenerates true random numbers with a throughput of 3.44 Gb/s (per DRAM\nchannel), outperforming the state-of-the-art DRAM-based TRNG by 15.08x and\n1.41x for basic and throughput-optimized versions, respectively.

Cameras are usually statically linked to the robot's body,\nlimiting the extra degrees of freedom for visual information acquisition. In\nthis work, we overcome the aforementioned problem by introducing and leveraging\nan independently rotating camera on the robot base. This enables us to\ncontinuously control the heading of the camera, obtaining the desired optimal\norientation for active V-SLAM, without rotating the robot itself. However, this\nadditional degree of freedom introduces additional estimation uncertainties,\nwhich need to be accounted for. We do this by extending our robot's state\nestimate to include the camera state and jointly estimate the uncertainties. We\ndevelop our method based on a state-of-the-art active V-SLAM approach for\nomnidirectional robots, and evaluate it through rigorous simulation and real\nrobot experiments. We obtain more accurate maps, with lower energy consumption,\nwhile maintaining the benefits of the active approach with respect to the\nbaseline.

By providing prior knowledge of the robot and detecting the objects in\nthe image, it predicts the correlation between the attributes of the object and\nthe objects and converts them into a graph-based representation; and mapping\nthe object in the image to be a top-down egocentric map. Finally, the important\nobject features of the current task are extracted by Graph Neural Networks. The\nmethod proposed in this paper is verified in the ALFRED (Action Learning From\nRealistic Environments and Directives) dataset.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for the sequential positioning\n(or nested dissection) of two planar interfaces in an arbitrary polyhedron,\nsuch that, after each truncation, the respectively remaining polyhedron admits\na prescribed volume. This task, among others, is frequently encountered in the\nnumerical simulation of three-phase flows when resorting to the geometric\nVolume-of-Fluid method. For two-phase flows, the recent work of Kromer and\nBothe (arXiv:2101.03861) addresses the positioning of a single plane by\ncombining an implicit bracketing of the sought position with up to third-order\nderivatives of the volume fraction. An analogous application of their highly\nefficient root-finding scheme to three-material configurations requires\ncomputing the volume of a twice truncated arbitrary polyhedron. The present\nmanuscript achieves this by recursive application of the Gaussian divergence\ntheorem in appropriate form, which allows to compute the volume as a sum of\nquantities associated to the faces of the original polyhedron. With a suitable\nchoice of the coordinate origin, accounting for the sequential character of the\ntruncation, the volume parametrization becomes co-moving with respect to the\nplanes. This eliminates the necessity to establish topological connectivity and\ntetrahedron decomposition after each truncation. After a detailed mathematical\ndescription of the concept, we conduct a series of carefully designed numerical\nexperiments to assess the performance in terms of polyhedron truncations. The\nhigh efficiency of the two-phase positioning persists for sequential\napplication, thereby being robust with respect to input data and possible\nintersection topologies. In comparison to an existing decomposition-based\napproach, the number of truncations was reduced by up to an order of magnitude,\nfurther highlighting the superiority of the divergence-based volume\ncomputation.",

    "title": "On the Secrecy Capacity of 2-user Gaussian Z-Interference Channel with  Shared Key",
    "abstract": "In this paper, the role of secret key with finite rate is studied to enhance\nthe secrecy performance of the system when users are operating in interference\nlimited scenarios. To address this problem, a 2-user Gaussian Z-IC with secrecy\nconstraint at the receiver is considered. One of the fundamental problems here\nis how to use the secret key as a part of the encoding process. The paper\nproposes novel achievable schemes, where the schemes differ from each other\nbased on how the key has been used in the encoding process. The first\nachievable scheme uses one part of the key for one-time pad and remaining part\nof the key for wiretap coding. The encoding is performed such that the receiver\nexperiencing interference can decode some part of the interference without\nviolating the secrecy constraint. As a special case of the derived result, one\ncan obtain the secrecy rate region when the key is completely used for one-time\npad or part of the wiretap coding. The second scheme uses the shared key to\nencrypt the message using one-time pad and in contrast to the previous case no\ninterference is decoded at the receiver. The paper also derives an outer bound\non the sum rate and secrecy rate of the transmitter which causes interference.\nThe main novelty of deriving outer bound lies in the selection of side\ninformation provided to the receiver and using the secrecy constraint at the\nreceiver. The derived outer bounds are found to be tight depending on the\nchannel conditions and rate of the key. The scaling behaviour of key rate is\nalso explored for different schemes using the notion of secure GDOF. The\noptimality of different schemes is characterized for some specific cases. The\ndeveloped results show the importance of key rate splitting in enhancing the\nsecrecy performance of the system when users are operating under interference\nlimited environment.",

    "abstract": "For the General Factor problem we are given an undirected graph $G$ and for\neach vertex $v\\in V(G)$ a finite set $B_v$ of non-negative integers. The task\nis to decide if there is a subset $S\\subseteq E(G)$ such that $deg_S(v)\\in B_v$\nfor all vertices $v$ of $G$. The maxgap of a finite integer set $B$ is the\nlargest $d\\ge 0$ such that there is an $a\\ge 0$ with $[a,a+d+1]\\cap\nB=\\{a,a+d+1\\}$. Cornu\\'ejols (1988) showed that if the maxgap of all sets $B_v$\nis at most 1, then the decision version of General Factor is poly-time\nsolvable. Dudycz and Paluch (2018) extended this result for the minimization\nand maximization versions. Using convolution techniques from van Rooij (2020),\nwe improve upon the previous algorithm by Arulselvan et al. (2018) and present\nan algorithm counting the number of solutions of a certain size in time\n$O^*((M+1)^k)$, given a tree decomposition of width $k$, where $M=\\max_v \\max\nB_v$.\nWe prove that this algorithm is essentially optimal for all cases that are\nnot polynomial time solvable for the decision, minimization or maximization\nversions. We prove that such improvements are not possible even for $B$-Factor,\nwhich is General Factor on graphs where all sets $B_v$ agree with the fixed set\n$B$. We show that for every fixed $B$ where the problem is NP-hard, our new\nalgorithm cannot be significantly improved: assuming the Strong Exponential\nTime Hypothesis (SETH), no algorithm can solve $B$-Factor in time $O^*((\\max\nB+1-\\epsilon)^k)$ for any $\\epsilon>0$. We extend this bound to the counting\nversion of $B$-Factor for arbitrary, non-trivial sets $B$, assuming #SETH.\nWe also investigate the parameterization of the problem by cutwidth. Unlike\nfor treewidth, a larger set $B$ does not make the problem harder: Given a\nlinear layout of width $k$ we give a $O^*(2^k)$ algorithm for any $B$ and\nprovide a matching lower bound that this is optimal for the NP-hard cases.",

Existing methods\naggregate models disregarding their internal representations, which are crucial\nfor training models in vision tasks.

To\nthis end, we introduce a method, called FedProto, which computes client\ndeviations using margins of prototypical representations learned on distributed\ndata, and applies them to drive federated optimization via an attention\nmechanism. In addition, we propose three methods to analyse statistical\nproperties of feature representations learned in FL, in order to elucidate the\nrelationship between accuracy, margins and feature discrepancy of FL models. In\nexperimental analyses, FedProto demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy and\nconvergence rate across image classification and semantic segmentation\nbenchmarks by enabling maximum margin training of FL models. Moreover, FedProto\nreduces uncertainty of predictions of FL models compared to the baseline.

To reduce uncertainty in the\nresults of such simulation-based studies, the same simulation studies can be\nperformed in different simulation software. Many traffic simulation software\npackages (Aimsun, SymuVia, Vissim, SUMO) are currently available for traffic\nimpact assessment of new technologies such as truckplatooning. However, to\nfully model and simulate the functionalities of such advanced technologies in\ndifferent simulation environments, several extensions need to be made to the\nsimulation platforms. In most cases, these extensions have to be programmed in\ndifferent programming languages (C++, Python) and each simulator has its own\nsimulator specific API. This makes it difficult to reuse software written for a\nspecific functionality in one simulation platform in a different simulation\nplatform. To overcome this issue, this paper presents a novel architecture for\ncross-platform simulation. The architecture is designed such that a specific\nfunctionality such as truck-platooning or any other functionality is made\nplatform independent. We designed a cross-platform architecture for simulating\na truck-platooning functionality using Vissim and SymuVia simulation software\nto determine the traffic flow effects of multi-brand truck platooning in the\ncontext of the EU project ENSEMBLE.

    "abstract": "In recent years, knowledge graph completion methods have been extensively\nstudied, in which graph embedding approaches learn low dimensional\nrepresentations of entities and relations to predict missing facts. Those\nmodels usually view the relation vector as a translation (TransE) or rotation\n(rotatE and QuatE) between entity pairs, enjoying the advantage of simplicity\nand efficiency. However, QuatE has two main problems: 1) The model to capture\nthe ability of representation and feature interaction between entities and\nrelations are relatively weak because it only relies on the rigorous\ncalculation of three embedding vectors; 2) Although the model can handle\nvarious relation patterns including symmetry, anti-symmetry, inversion and\ncomposition, but mapping properties of relations are not to be considered, such\nas one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel model, QuatDE, with a dynamic mapping strategy to explicitly capture a\nvariety of relational patterns, enhancing the feature interaction capability\nbetween elements of the triplet. Our model relies on three extra vectors\ndonated as subject transfer vector, object transfer vector and relation\ntransfer vector. The mapping strategy dynamically selects the transition\nvectors associated with each triplet, used to adjust the point position of the\nentity embedding vectors in the quaternion space via Hamilton product.\nExperiment results show QuatDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on three\nwell-established knowledge graph completion benchmarks.

The method\ndirectly handles the nonlinear dynamics of the spacecraft, sun exclusion\nconstraint, torque and momentum limits on the reaction wheels as well as\npotential faults in these actuators. A sequential convex programming approach\nwas used to reformulate non-convex pointing objectives and other constraints in\nterms of a series of novel convex cardinality minimization problems. These\nsubproblems were then efficiently solved even on limited hardware resources\nusing convex programming solvers implementing second-order conic constraints.\nThe proposed method was applied to a scenario that involved maximizing the\nscience time for the upcoming Comet Interceptor flyby mission developed by the\nEuropean Space Agency. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the capability\nof the approach to generate viable trajectories even in the presence of\nreaction wheel failures or prior dust particle impacts.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an automatic image correction method for portrait\nphotographs, which promotes consistency of facial skin color by suppressing\nskin color changes due to background colors. In portrait photographs, skin\ncolor is often distorted due to the lighting environment (e.g., light reflected\nfrom a colored background wall and over-exposure by a camera strobe), and if\nthe photo is artificially combined with another background color, this color\nchange is emphasized, resulting in an unnatural synthesized result. In our\nframework, after roughly extracting the face region and rectifying the skin\ncolor distribution in a color space, we perform color and brightness correction\naround the face in the original image to achieve a proper color balance of the\nfacial image, which is not affected by luminance and background colors. Unlike\nconventional algorithms for color correction, our final result is attained by a\ncolor correction process with a guide image. In particular, our guided image\nfiltering for the color correction does not require a perfectly-aligned guide\nimage required in the original guide image filtering method proposed by He et\nal. Experimental results show that our method generates more natural results\nthan conventional methods on not only headshot photographs but also natural\nscene photographs. We also show automatic yearbook style photo generation as an\nanother application.",

To explore the\nquestion, a novel evaluation task, called Relation Direction Recognition (RDR),\nis proposed to explore whether models learn the directionality of relations.\nThree metrics for RDR are introduced to measure the degree to which models\nrecognize the directionality of relations. Several state-of-the-art models are\nevaluated on RDR. Experimental results on a real-world dataset indicate that\nthere are clear gaps among them in recognizing the directionality of relations,\neven though these models obtain similar performance in the traditional metric\n(e.g. Macro-F1).

    "abstract": "Machine learning and data mining techniques are effective tools to classify\nlarge amounts of data. But they tend to preserve any inherent bias in the data,\nfor example, with regards to gender or race. Removing such bias from data or\nthe learned representations is quite challenging. In this paper we study a\ngeometric problem which models a possible approach for bias removal. Our input\nis a set of points P in Euclidean space R^d and each point is labeled with k\nbinary-valued properties. A priori we assume that it is \"easy\" to classify the\ndata according to each property. Our goal is to obstruct the classification\naccording to one property by a suitable projection to a lower-dimensional\nEuclidean space R^m (m < d), while classification according to all other\nproperties remains easy.\nWhat it means for classification to be easy depends on the classification\nmodel used. We first consider classification by linear separability as employed\nby support vector machines. We use Kirchberger's Theorem to show that, under\ncertain conditions, a simple projection to R^(d-1) suffices to eliminate the\nlinear separability of one of the properties whilst maintaining the linear\nseparability of the other properties. We also study the problem of maximizing\nthe linear \"inseparability\" of the chosen property. Second, we consider more\ncomplex forms of separability and prove a connection between the number of\nprojections required to obstruct classification and the Helly-type properties\nof such separabilities.",

In the case of finite\nelement approximation, ${\\mathbb A}$ is SPD with respect to the dot product\nassociated with the mass matrix. The BURA method is introduced by the best\nuniform rational approximation of degree $k$ of $t^{\\alpha}$ in $[0,1]$,\ndenoted by $r_{\\alpha,k}$.

Most of previous studies adopted the self persona in\ndialogue whose response was about to be selected from a set of candidates or\ndirectly generated, but few have noticed the role of partner in dialogue. This\npaper makes an attempt to thoroughly explore the impact of utilizing personas\nthat describe either self or partner speakers on the task of response selection\nin retrieval-based chatbots. Four persona fusion strategies are designed, which\nassume personas interact with contexts or responses in different ways.

Empirical studies on the Persona-Chat\ndataset show that the partner personas neglected in previous studies can\nimprove the accuracy of response selection in the IMN- and BERT-based models.\nBesides, our BERT-based model implemented with the context-response-aware\npersona fusion strategy outperforms previous methods by margins larger than\n2.7% on original personas and 4.6% on revised personas in terms of hits@1\n(top-1 accuracy), achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on the\nPersona-Chat dataset.",

    "abstract": "Data compression is widely used in contemporary column-oriented DBMSes to\nlower space usage and to speed up query processing. Pioneering systems have\nintroduced compression to tackle the disk bandwidth bottleneck by trading CPU\nprocessing power for it. The main issue of this is a trade-off between the\ncompression ratio and the decompression CPU cost. Existing results state that\nlight-weight compression with small decompression costs outperforms\nheavy-weight compression schemes in column-stores. However, since the time\nthese results were obtained, CPU, RAM, and disk performance have advanced\nconsiderably. Moreover, novel compression algorithms have emerged.\nIn this paper, we revisit the problem of compression in disk-based\ncolumn-stores. More precisely, we study the I/O-RAM compression scheme which\nimplies that there are two types of pages of different size: disk pages\n(compressed) and in-memory pages (uncompressed). In this scheme, the buffer\nmanager is responsible for decompressing pages as soon as they arrive from\ndisk. This scheme is rather popular as it is easy to implement: several modern\ncolumn and row-stores use it.\nWe pose and address the following research questions: 1) Are heavy-weight\ncompression schemes still inappropriate for disk-based column-stores?, 2) Are\nnew light-weight compression algorithms better than the old ones?, 3) Is there\na need for SIMD-employing decompression algorithms in case of a disk-based\nsystem?

    "abstract": "In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) has been successfully applied to detect\nand classify Radio Frequency (RF) Signals. A DL approach is especially useful\nsince it identifies the presence of a signal without needing full protocol\ninformation, and can also detect and/or classify non-communication waveforms,\nsuch as radar signals. In this work, we focus on the different pre-processing\nsteps that can be used on the input training data, and test the results on a\nfixed DL architecture. While previous works have mostly focused exclusively on\neither time-domain or frequency domain approaches, we propose a hybrid image\nthat takes advantage of both time and frequency domain information, and tackles\nthe classification as a Computer Vision problem. Our initial results point out\nlimitations to classical pre-processing approaches while also showing that it's\npossible to build a classifier that can leverage the strengths of multiple\nsignal representations.",

    "abstract": "In this work a general approach to compute a compressed representation of the\nexponential $\\exp(h)$ of a high-dimensional function $h$ is presented. Such\nexponential functions play an important role in several problems in Uncertainty\nQuantification, e.g. the approximation of log-normal random fields or the\nevaluation of Bayesian posterior measures. Usually, these high-dimensional\nobjects are intractable numerically and can only be accessed pointwise in\nsampling methods. In contrast, the proposed method constructs a functional\nrepresentation of the exponential by exploiting its nature as a solution of an\nordinary differential equation. The application of a Petrov--Galerkin scheme to\nthis equation provides a tensor train representation of the solution for which\nwe derive an efficient and reliable a posteriori error estimator. Numerical\nexperiments with a log-normal random field and a Bayesian likelihood illustrate\nthe performance of the approach in comparison to other recent low-rank\nrepresentations for the respective applications. Although the present work\nconsiders only a specific differential equation, the presented method can be\napplied in a more general setting. We show that the composition of a generic\nholonomic function and a high-dimensional function corresponds to a\ndifferential equation that can be used in our method. Moreover, the\ndifferential equation can be modified to adapt the norm in the a posteriori\nerror estimates to the problem at hand.",

Bitcoins\nare associated with alpha-numeric addresses and are transferred via\ntransactions. Each transaction is composed of a set of input addresses\n(associated with unspent outputs received from previous transactions) and a set\nof output addresses (to which Bitcoins are transferred). Despite Bitcoin was\ndesigned with anonymity in mind, different heuristic approaches exist to detect\nwhich addresses in a specific transaction belong to the same entity. By\napplying these heuristics, we build an Address Correspondence Network: in this\nrepresentation, addresses are nodes are connected with edges if at least one\nheuristic detects them as belonging to the same entity. %addresses are nodes\nand edges are drawn between addresses detected as belonging to the same entity\nby at least one heuristic. %nodes represent addresses and edges model the\nlikelihood that two nodes belong to the same entity %In this network, connected\ncomponents represent sets of addresses controlled by the same entity.

Gossip SGD, where each node averages only with its neighbors, is more\ncommunication-efficient than the prevalent parallel SGD. However, its\nconvergence rate is reversely proportional to quantity $1-\\beta$ which measures\nthe network connectivity. On large and sparse networks where $1-\\beta \\to 0$,\nGossip SGD requires more iterations to converge, which offsets against its\ncommunication benefit. This paper introduces Gossip-PGA, which adds Periodic\nGlobal Averaging into Gossip SGD.

Recently, a few of works\nexpand this task from 2D image to 3D point cloud by using global point cloud\noptimization. However, the perturbations of global point are not effective for\nmisleading the victim model. First, not all points are important in\noptimization toward misleading. Abundant points account considerable distortion\nbudget but contribute trivially to attack. Second, the multi-label optimization\nis suboptimal for adversarial attack, since it consumes extra energy in finding\nmulti-label victim model collapse and causes instance transformation to be\ndissimilar to any particular instance. Third, the independent adversarial and\nperceptibility losses, caring misclassification and dissimilarity separately,\ntreat the updating of each point equally without a focus. Therefore, once\nperceptibility loss approaches its budget threshold, all points would be stock\nin the surface of hypersphere and attack would be locked in local optimality.\nTherefore, we propose a local aggressive adversarial attacks (L3A) to solve\nabove issues. Technically, we select a bunch of salient points, the high-score\nsubset of point cloud according to gradient, to perturb. Then a flow of\naggressive optimization strategies are developed to reinforce the unperceptive\ngeneration of adversarial examples toward misleading victim models.

Now, an image of a scene\ncan be rendered in a level-of-detail manner, so we posit that a complicated\nregion of the scene should be represented by a large neural network while a\nsmall neural network is capable of encoding a simple region, enabling a balance\nbetween efficiency and quality.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) as an emerging technique have\nshown superior capacity of dealing with heterogeneous information network\n(HIN). However, most HGNNs follow a semi-supervised learning manner, which\nnotably limits their wide use in reality since labels are usually scarce in\nreal applications. Recently, contrastive learning, a self-supervised method,\nbecomes one of the most exciting learning paradigms and shows great potential\nwhen there are no labels. In this paper, we study the problem of\nself-supervised HGNNs and propose a novel co-contrastive learning mechanism for\nHGNNs, named HeCo. Different from traditional contrastive learning which only\nfocuses on contrasting positive and negative samples, HeCo employs\ncross-viewcontrastive mechanism. Specifically, two views of a HIN (network\nschema and meta-path views) are proposed to learn node embeddings, so as to\ncapture both of local and high-order structures simultaneously. Then the\ncross-view contrastive learning, as well as a view mask mechanism, is proposed,\nwhich is able to extract the positive and negative embeddings from two views.\nThis enables the two views to collaboratively supervise each other and finally\nlearn high-level node embeddings. Moreover, two extensions of HeCo are designed\nto generate harder negative samples with high quality, which further boosts the\nperformance of HeCo. Extensive experiments conducted on a variety of real-world\nnetworks show the superior performance of the proposed methods over the\nstate-of-the-arts.",

Despite various\nfact-checking websites such as PolitiFact, robust detection techniques are\nrequired to deal with the increase in fake news. Several deep learning models\nshow promising results for fake news classification, however, their black-box\nnature makes it difficult to explain their classification decisions and\nquality-assure the models. We here address this problem by proposing a novel\ninterpretable fake news detection framework based on the recently introduced\nTsetlin Machine (TM). In brief, we utilize the conjunctive clauses of the TM to\ncapture lexical and semantic properties of both true and fake news text.\nFurther, we use the clause ensembles to calculate the credibility of fake news.\nFor evaluation, we conduct experiments on two publicly available datasets,\nPolitiFact and GossipCop, and demonstrate that the TM framework significantly\noutperforms previously published baselines by at least $5\\%$ in terms of\naccuracy, with the added benefit of an interpretable logic-based\nrepresentation. Further, our approach provides higher F1-score than BERT and\nXLNet, however, we obtain slightly lower accuracy.

This paper focuses on how data centers can use\ntheir geographic load flexibility to reduce carbon emissions through clever\ninteractions with electricity markets. Because electricity market clearing\naccounts for congestion and power flow physics in the electric grid, the carbon\nemissions associated with electricity use varies between (potentially\ngeographically close) locations. Using our knowledge about this process, we\npropose a new and improved metric to guide geographic load shifting, which we\nrefer to as the locational marginal carbon emission $\\lambda_{\\text{CO}_2}$. We\ncompare this and three other shifting metrics on their ability to reduce carbon\nemissions and generation costs throughout the course of a year. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that $\\lambda_{\\text{CO}_2}$ is more effective in reducing carbon\nemissions than more commonly proposed metrics that do not account for the\nspecifics of the power grid.",

    "abstract": "Automatic and accurate detection of anatomical landmarks is an essential\noperation in medical image analysis with a multitude of applications. Recent\ndeep learning methods have improved results by directly encoding the appearance\nof the captured anatomy with the likelihood maps (i.e., heatmaps). However,\nmost current solutions overlook another essence of heatmap regression, the\nobjective metric for regressing target heatmaps and rely on hand-crafted\nheuristics to set the target precision, thus being usually cumbersome and\ntask-specific. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-to-learn framework\nfor landmark detection to optimize the neural network and the target precision\nsimultaneously. The pivot of this work is to leverage the reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework to search objective metrics for regressing multiple\nheatmaps dynamically during the training process, thus avoiding setting\nproblem-specific target precision. We also introduce an early-stop strategy for\nactive termination of the RL agent's interaction that adapts the optimal\nprecision for separate targets considering exploration-exploitation tradeoffs.\nThis approach shows better stability in training and improved localization\naccuracy in inference. Extensive experimental results on two different\napplications of landmark localization: 1) our in-house prenatal ultrasound (US)\ndataset and 2) the publicly available dataset of cephalometric X-Ray landmark\ndetection, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our proposed\nframework is general and shows the potential to improve the efficiency of\nanatomical landmark detection.",

For each company we analyzed the communication among employees\nboth in terms of network structure and content (language used). Over a period\nof eight months, we analyzed more than 52,000 messages posted by approximately\n12,000 employees. Specifically, we tested the network robustness and the\nstability of a set of structural and semantic metrics, while applying several\ndifferent node removal strategies. We removed the forum moderators, the\nspammers, the overly connected nodes and the nodes lying at the network\nperiphery, also testing different combinations of these selections. Results\nindicate that removing spammers and very peripheral nodes can be a relatively\nlow impact strategy in this context; accordingly, it could be used to clean the\nnoise generated by these types of social actor and to reduce the computation\ncomplexity of the analysis. On the other hand, the removal of moderators seems\nto have a significant impact on the network connectivity and the shared\ncontent. The most affected variables are closeness centrality and contribution\nindex. We also found that the removal of overly connected nodes can\nsignificantly change the network structure. Lastly, we compared the behavior of\nmoderators with the other users, finding distinctive characteristics by which\nmoderators can be identified when their list is unknown. Our findings can help\nonline community managers to understand the role of moderators within intranet\nforums and can be useful for social network analysts who are interested in\nevaluating the effects of graph simplification techniques.",

The advancement of non-visible light sensors, such\nas acoustic imaging sensors, has attracted much attention, as they allow people\nto visualize the intensity of sound waves beyond the visible spectrum. However,\nbecause of the limitations imposed on acquiring acoustic data, new methods for\nimproving the resolution of the acoustic images are necessary.

This work\nproposed a novel backprojection model architecture for the acoustic image\nsuper-resolution problem, together with Acoustic Map Imaging VUB-ULB Dataset\n(AMIVU). The dataset provides large simulated and real captured images at\ndifferent resolutions. The proposed XCycles BackProjection model (XCBP), in\ncontrast to the feedforward model approach, fully uses the iterative correction\nprocedure in each cycle to reconstruct the residual error correction for the\nencoded features in both low- and high-resolution space. The proposed approach\nwas evaluated on the dataset and showed high outperformance compared to the\nclassical interpolation operators and to the recent feedforward\nstate-of-the-art models.

    "abstract": "Crucial to freight carriers is the tactical planning of the service network.\nThe aim is to obtain a cyclic plan over a given tactical planning horizon that\nsatisfies predicted demand at a minimum cost. A central input to the planning\nprocess is the periodic demand, that is, the demand expected to repeat in every\nperiod in the planning horizon. We focus on large-scale tactical planning\nproblems that require deterministic models for computational tractability. The\nproblem of estimating periodic demand in this setting broadly present in\npractice has hitherto been overlooked in the literature. We address this gap by\nformally introducing the periodic demand estimation problem and propose a\ntwo-step methodology: Based on time series forecasts obtained in the first\nstep, we propose, in the second step, to solve a multilevel mathematical\nprogramming formulation whose solution is a periodic demand estimate that\nminimizes fixed costs, and variable costs incurred by adapting the tactical\nplan at an operational level. We report results in an extensive empirical study\nof a real large-scale application from the Canadian National Railway Company.\nWe compare our periodic demand estimates to the approach commonly used in\npractice which simply consists in using the mean of the time series forecasts.\nThe results clearly show the importance of the periodic demand estimation\nproblem. Indeed, the planning costs exhibit an important variation over\ndifferent periodic demand estimates, and using an estimate different from the\nmean forecast can lead to substantial cost reductions. For example, the costs\nassociated with the period demand estimates based on forecasts were comparable\nto, or even better than those obtained using the mean of actual demand.",

In doing so the number of\nglobally coupled degrees-of-freedom are reduced, but at the expense of a more\ndifficult problem to analyse. We will show, however, that the Schur complement\nof the statically condensed system is spectrally equivalent to a simple trace\npressure mass matrix. This result is used to formulate a new, provably optimal\npreconditioner. Through numerical examples in two- and three-dimensions we show\nthat the new preconditioned iterative method converges in fewer iterations, has\nsuperior conservation properties for inexact solves, and is faster in CPU time\nwhen compared to our previous preconditioner.",

    "abstract": "Domain generalizable (DG) person re-identification (ReID) is a challenging\nproblem because we cannot access any unseen target domain data during training.\nAlmost all the existing DG ReID methods follow the same pipeline where they use\na hybrid dataset from multiple source domains for training, and then directly\napply the trained model to the unseen target domains for testing. These methods\noften neglect individual source domains' discriminative characteristics and\ntheir relevances w.r.t. the unseen target domains, though both of which can be\nleveraged to help the model's generalization. To handle the above two issues,\nwe propose a novel method called the relevance-aware mixture of experts\n(RaMoE), using an effective voting-based mixture mechanism to dynamically\nleverage source domains' diverse characteristics to improve the model's\ngeneralization. Specifically, we propose a decorrelation loss to make the\nsource domain networks (experts) keep the diversity and discriminability of\nindividual domains' characteristics. Besides, we design a voting network to\nadaptively integrate all the experts' features into the more generalizable\naggregated features with domain relevance. Considering the target domains'\ninvisibility during training, we propose a novel learning-to-learn algorithm\ncombined with our relation alignment loss to update the voting network.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RaMoE outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

It has been widely adopted as a mainstream hunting method in many\norganizations, such as financial institutes, manufacturing companies and\ngovernment agencies. However, there are two challenging issues in the existing\ndesigns: 1) achieving excellent performance of threat detection is often at the\ncost of a large number of false positives, leading to the problem of alert\nfatigue and 2) the interpretability of detection results is low, making it\ndifficult for the security analyst to obtain the insight of threats and take\npromptly actions against the attacks.\nTo tackle the above issues, in this paper we propose a defense mechanism,\nDarkHunter, that includes three parts: stream processor, detection engine and\nincident analyzer. The stream processor converts raw network packet streams\ninto data records of a set of statistical features that can be effectively used\nfor learning; The detection engine leverages an efficient ensemble neural\nnetwork (EnsembleNet) to identify anomalous network traffic; The incident\nanalyzer applies a correlation analysis to filter out the mis-predictions from\nEnsembleNet, traces each detected threat from its statistical representation\nback to its source traffic flow to enhance its intelligibility and prioritizes\nthe threats to be responded to minimize security risks. Our evaluations, based\non the UNSW-NB15 testbed, show that DarkHunter significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art ML-based NIDS designs by achieving higher accuracy, higher\ndetection rate, higher precision, higher F1 score while keeping lower false\nalarm rate.",

However, existing methods cannot fully exploit the graph properties\nof views, e.g., supergraph views and common subgraph views, which leads to a\nlow view utility and duplicate view content. To address the problem, we propose\nan end-to-end graph view selection tool, G-View, which can judiciously generate\na view set from a query workload by exploring the graph properties of candidate\nviews and considering their efficacy. Specifically, given a graph query set and\na space budget, G-View translates each query to a candidate view pattern and\nchecks the query containment via a filtering-and-verification framework. G-View\nthen selects the views using a graph gene algorithm (GGA), which relies on a\nthree-phase framework that explores graph view transformations to reduce the\nview space and optimize the view benefit. Finally, G-View generates the\nextended graph views that persist all the edge-induced subgraphs to answer the\nsubgraph and supergraph queries simultaneously. Extensive experiments on\nreal-life and synthetic datasets demonstrated G-View achieved averagely 21x and\n2x query performance speedup over two view-based methods while having 2x and 5x\nsmaller space overhead, respectively.

    "abstract": "We propose a new discretization method for PDEs on moving domains in the\nsetting of unfitted finite element methods, which is provably higher-order\naccurate in space and time. In the considered setting, the physical domain that\nevolves essentially arbitrarily through a time-independent computational\nbackground domain, is represented by a level set function. For the time\ndiscretization, the application of standard time stepping schemes that are\nbased on finite difference approximations of the time derivative is not\ndirectly possible, as the degrees of freedom may get active or inactive across\nsuch a finite difference stencil in time. In [Lehrenfeld, Olshanskii. An\nEulerian finite element method for PDEs in time-dependent domains. ESAIM: M2AN,\n53:585--614, 2019] this problem is overcome by extending the discrete solution\nat every timestep to a sufficiently large neighborhood so that all the degrees\nof freedom that are relevant at the next time step stay active. But that paper\nfocuses on low-order methods. We advance these results with introducing and\nanalyzing realizable techniques for the extension to higher order. To obtain\nhigher-order convergence in space and time, we combine the BDF time stepping\nwith the isoparametric unfitted FEM. The latter has been used and analyzed for\nseveral stationary problems before. However, for moving domains the key\ningredient in the method, the transformation of the underlying mesh, becomes\ntime-dependent which gives rise to some technical issues.

    "abstract": "In this study we propose a method based on e-mail social network analysis to\ncompare the communication behavior of managers who voluntarily quit their job\nand managers who decide to stay. Collecting 18 months of e-mail, we analyzed\nthe communication behavior of 866 managers, out of which 111 left a large\nglobal service company. We compared differences in communication patterns by\ncomputing social network metrics, such as betweenness and closeness centrality,\nand content analysis indicators, such as emotionality and complexity of the\nlanguage used. To study the emergence of managers' disengagement, we made a\ndistinction based on the period of e-mail data examined. We observed\ncommunications during months 5 and 4 before managers left, and found\nsignificant variations in both their network structure and use of language.\nResults indicate that on average managers who quit had lower closeness\ncentrality and less engaged conversations. In addition, managers who chose to\nquit tended to shift their communication behavior starting from 5 months before\nleaving, by increasing their degree and closeness centrality, the complexity of\ntheir language, as well as their oscillations in betweenness centrality and the\nnumber of \"nudges\" they need to send to peers before getting an answer.",

We define $cost_{\\gamma}(S)=\\min_{p \\in\nS}\\{cost_{\\gamma}(p,S)\\}$ for $S \\subseteq P$. In the $\\gamma$-dispersion\nproblem, a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and a positive integer $k\n\\in [\\gamma+1,n]$ are given.

    "abstract": "Given a specification $\\varphi(X,Y)$ over inputs $X$ and output $Y$, defined\nover a background theory $\\mathbb{T}$, the problem of program synthesis is to\ndesign a program $f$ such that $Y=f(X)$ satisfies the specification $\\varphi$.\nOver the past decade, syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS) has emerged as a dominant\napproach for program synthesis where in addition to the specification\n$\\varphi$, the end-user also specifies a grammar $L$ to aid the underlying\nsynthesis engine. This paper investigates the feasibility of synthesis\ntechniques without grammar, a sub-class defined as $\\mathbb{T}$-constrained\nsynthesis.\nWe show that $\\mathbb{T}$-constrained synthesis can be reduced to\nDQF($\\mathbb{T}$), i.e., to the problem of finding a witness of a Dependency\nQuantified Formula Modulo Theory. When the underlying theory is the theory of\nbitvectors, the corresponding DQF(BV) problem can be further reduced to\nDependency Quantified Boolean Formulas (DQBF). We rely on the progress in DQBF\nsolving to design DQBF-based synthesizers that outperform the domain-specific\nprogram synthesis techniques, thereby positioning DQBF as a core representation\nlanguage for program synthesis. Our empirical analysis shows that\n$\\mathbb{T}$-constrained synthesis can achieve significantly better performance\nthan syntax-guided approaches. Furthermore, the general-purpose DQBF solvers\nperform on par with domain-specific synthesis techniques.",

To\nachieve this, it is first important to understand which factors influence trust\nin AI. We identify that a research gap exists regarding the role of personal\nvalues in trust in AI. Therefore, this paper studies how human and agent Value\nSimilarity (VS) influences a human's trust in that agent. To explore this, 89\nparticipants teamed up with five different agents, which were designed with\nvarying levels of value similarity to that of the participants. In a\nwithin-subjects, scenario-based experiment, agents gave suggestions on what to\ndo when entering the building to save a hostage. We analyzed the agent's scores\non subjective value similarity, trust and qualitative data from open-ended\nquestions. Our results show that agents rated as having more similar values\nalso scored higher on trust, indicating a positive effect between the two. With\nthis result, we add to the existing understanding of human-agent trust by\nproviding insight into the role of value-similarity.",

    "abstract": "Airborne (or flying) base stations (ABSs) embedded on drones or unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deemed as a central element of envisioned 6G\ncellular networks where significant cell densification with mmWave/Terahertz\ncommunications will be part of the ecosystem. Nonetheless, one of the key\nchallenges facing the deployment of ABSs is the inherent limited available\nenergy of the drone, which limits the hovering time for serving ground users to\nthe orders of minutes. This impediment deteriorate the performance of the\nUAV-enabled cellular network and hinders wide adoption and use of the\ntechnology. In this paper, we propose robotic airborne base stations (RABSs)\nwith grasping capabilities to increase the serving time of ground users by\nmultiple orders of magnitude compared to nominal hovering based operation. More\nspecifically, to perform the grasping task, the RABS is equipped with a\nversatile, albeit, general purpose gripper manipulator. Depending on the type\nof the gripper RABS can provide service in the range of hours, compared to\nminutes of hovering based ABSs. In theory it is possible that grasping can be\nenergy neutral, hence the time of service can be bounded by the communications\nenergy consumption. To illustrate the case, energy consumption comparison\nbetween hovering and grasping is performed in order to reveal the significant\nbenefits of the proposed approach. Finally, overarching challenges, design\nconsiderations for RABS, and future avenues of research are outlined to realize\nthe full potential of the proposed robotic aerial base stations.",

We run a\ncomparative study, where we ask people to select 'good' and 'misleading' views\nbetween scatterplots of low-level projections of image datasets, simulating the\nway people usually select projections. We use the study data as labels for a\nset of quality metrics whose purpose is to discover and quantify what exactly\npeople are looking for when deciding between projections. With this proxy for\nhuman judgments, we use it to rank projections on new datasets, explain why\nthey are relevant, and quantify the degree of subjectivity in projections\nselected.",

    "abstract": "Given the voluminous nature of the multimedia sensed data, the Multimedia\nInternet of Things (MIoT) devices and networks will present several limitations\nin terms of power and communication overhead. One traditional solution to cope\nwith the large-size data challenge is to use lossy compression. However,\ncurrent lossy compression schemes require low compression rate to guarantee\nacceptable perceived image quality, which results in a low reduction of the\ncommunicated data size and consequently a low reduction in the energy and\nbandwidth consumption. Thus, an efficient compression solution is required for\nstriking a good balance between data size (and consequently communication\noverhead) and visual degradation. In this paper, a Deep-Learning (DL)\nsuper-resolution model is applied to recuperate high quality images (at the\napplication server side) given as input degraded images with a high compression\nratio (at the sender side). The experimental analysis shows the effectiveness\nof the proposed solution in enhancing the visual quality of the compressed and\ndown-scaled images. Consequently, the proposed solution reduces the overall\ncommunication overhead and power consumption of limited MIoT devices.",

This makes\nit very challenging to optimally manage the resources (e.g., controlling the\nnumber and frequency of different types of cores) at runtime to meet the\ndesired trade-offs among multiple objectives such as performance and energy.\nThis paper proposes a novel information-theoretic framework referred to as\nPaRMIS to create Pareto-optimal resource management policies for given target\napplications and design objectives. PaRMIS specifies parametric policies to\nmanage resources and learns statistical models from candidate policy evaluation\ndata in the form of target design objective values. The key idea is to select a\ncandidate policy for evaluation in each iteration guided by statistical models\nthat maximize the information gain about the true Pareto front.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of extracting variable-depth \"logical\ndocument hierarchy\" from long documents, namely organizing the recognized\n\"physical document objects\" into hierarchical structures. The discovery of\nlogical document hierarchy is the vital step to support many downstream\napplications. However, long documents, containing hundreds or even thousands of\npages and variable-depth hierarchy, challenge the existing methods. To address\nthese challenges, we develop a framework, namely Hierarchy Extraction from Long\nDocument (HELD), where we \"sequentially\" insert each physical object at the\nproper on of the current tree. Determining whether each possible position is\nproper or not can be formulated as a binary classification problem. To further\nimprove its effectiveness and efficiency, we study the design variants in HELD,\nincluding traversal orders of the insertion positions, heading extraction\nexplicitly or implicitly, tolerance to insertion errors in predecessor steps,\nand so on. The empirical experiments based on thousands of long documents from\nChinese, English financial market and English scientific publication show that\nthe HELD model with the \"root-to-leaf\" traversal order and explicit heading\nextraction is the best choice to achieve the tradeoff between effectiveness and\nefficiency with the accuracy of 0.9726, 0.7291 and 0.9578 in Chinese financial,\nEnglish financial and arXiv datasets, respectively.

We first propose a least-squares\nalgorithm based on continuous-time observations and controls, and establish a\nlogarithmic regret bound of order $O((\\ln M)(\\ln\\ln M))$, with $M$ being the\nnumber of learning episodes. The analysis consists of two parts: perturbation\nanalysis, which exploits the regularity and robustness of the associated\nRiccati differential equation; and parameter estimation error, which relies on\nsub-exponential properties of continuous-time least-squares estimators. We\nfurther propose a practically implementable least-squares algorithm based on\ndiscrete-time observations and piecewise constant controls, which achieves\nsimilar logarithmic regret with an additional term depending explicitly on the\ntime stepsizes used in the algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) to forecast\ndominant wave periods in oceanic waters. First, we use the data collected from\nCDIP buoys and apply various data filtering methods. The data filtering methods\nallow us to obtain a high-quality dataset for training and validation purposes.\nWe then extract various wave-based features like wave heights, periods,\nskewness, kurtosis, etc., and atmospheric features like humidity, pressure, and\nair temperature for the buoys. Afterward, we train algorithms that use LightGBM\nand Extra Trees through a hv-block cross-validation scheme to forecast dominant\nwave periods for up to 30 days ahead. LightGBM has the R2 score of 0.94, 0.94,\nand 0.94 for 1-day ahead, 15-day ahead, and 30-day ahead prediction. Similarly,\nExtra Trees (ET) has an R2 score of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.85 for 1-day ahead,\n15-day ahead, and 30 day ahead prediction. In case of the test dataset,\nLightGBM has R2 score of 0.94, 0.94, and 0.94 for 1-day ahead, 15-day ahead and\n30-day ahead prediction. ET has R2 score of 0.88, 0.86, and 0.85 for 1-day\nahead, 15-day ahead, and 30-day ahead prediction. A similar R2 score for both\ntraining and the test dataset suggests that the machine learning models\ndeveloped in this paper are robust. Since the LightGBM algorithm outperforms ET\nfor all the windows tested, it is taken as the final algorithm. Note that the\nperformance of both methods does not decrease significantly as the forecast\nhorizon increases. Likewise, the proposed method outperforms the numerical\napproaches included in this paper in the test dataset. For 1 day ahead\nprediction, the proposed algorithm has SI, Bias, CC, and RMSE of 0.09, 0.00,\n0.97, and 1.78 compared to 0.268, 0.40, 0.63, and 2.18 for the European Centre\nfor Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model, which outperforms all the\nother methods in the test dataset.",

This\npaper aims to provide a solution to this problem through the use of contraction\ntheory. We first introduce general mathematical results that explain how\ncontraction theory guarantees the stability of the implicit and explicit Euler\nintegration methods.

In this work, we propose a multi-stage integration\nnetwork (i.e., MINet) for multi-contrast MRI SR, which explicitly models the\ndependencies between multi-contrast images at different stages to guide image\nSR. In particular, our MINet first learns a hierarchical feature representation\nfrom multiple convolutional stages for each of different-contrast image.\nSubsequently, we introduce a multi-stage integration module to mine the\ncomprehensive relations between the representations of the multi-contrast\nimages. Specifically, the module matches each representation with all other\nfeatures, which are integrated in terms of their similarities to obtain an\nenriched representation. Extensive experiments on fastMRI and real-world\nclinical datasets demonstrate that 1) our MINet outperforms state-of-the-art\nmulti-contrast SR methods in terms of various metrics and 2) our multi-stage\nintegration module is able to excavate complex interactions among\nmulti-contrast features at different stages, leading to improved target-image\nquality.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the standard variational autoencoder has been successfully used to\nlearn a probabilistic prior over speech signals, which is then used to perform\nspeech enhancement. Variational autoencoders have then been conditioned on a\nlabel describing a high-level speech attribute (e.g. speech activity) that\nallows for a more explicit control of speech generation. However, the label is\nnot guaranteed to be disentangled from the other latent variables, which\nresults in limited performance improvements compared to the standard\nvariational autoencoder. In this work, we propose to use an adversarial\ntraining scheme for variational autoencoders to disentangle the label from the\nother latent variables. At training, we use a discriminator that competes with\nthe encoder of the variational autoencoder. Simultaneously, we also use an\nadditional encoder that estimates the label for the decoder of the variational\nautoencoder, which proves to be crucial to learn disentanglement. We show the\nbenefit of the proposed disentanglement learning when a voice activity label,\nestimated from visual data, is used for speech enhancement.",

    "abstract": "Paired multi-modality medical images, can provide complementary information\nto help physicians make more reasonable decisions than single modality medical\nimages. But they are difficult to generate due to multiple factors in practice\n(e.g., time, cost, radiation dose). To address these problems, multi-modality\nmedical image translation has aroused increasing research interest recently.\nHowever, the existing works mainly focus on translation effect of a whole image\ninstead of a critical target area or Region of Interest (ROI), e.g., organ and\nso on. This leads to poor-quality translation of the localized target area\nwhich becomes blurry, deformed or even with extra unreasonable textures. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel target-aware generative adversarial network\ncalled TarGAN, which is a generic multi-modality medical image translation\nmodel capable of (1) learning multi-modality medical image translation without\nrelying on paired data, (2) enhancing quality of target area generation with\nthe help of target area labels. The generator of TarGAN jointly learns mapping\nat two levels simultaneously - whole image translation mapping and target area\ntranslation mapping. These two mappings are interrelated through a proposed\ncrossing loss. The experiments on both quantitative measures and qualitative\nevaluations demonstrate that TarGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in\nall cases. Subsequent segmentation task is conducted to demonstrate\neffectiveness of synthetic images generated by TarGAN in a real-world\napplication.

First, they\nonly use high-level features of the distorted image to regress the quality\nscore, while the human visual system (HVS) scores the image based on\nhierarchical features. Second, they simplify complex high-order interactions\nbetween viewports in a pairwise fashion through graphs. Third, in the graph\nconstruction, they only consider spatial locations of viewports, ignoring its\ncontent characteristics. Accordingly, to address these issues, we propose an\nadaptive hypergraph convolutional network for NR 360IQA, denoted as AHGCN.\nSpecifically, we first design a multi-level viewport descriptor for extracting\nhierarchical representations from viewports. Then, we model interactions\nbetween viewports through hypergraphs, where each hyperedge connects two or\nmore viewports. In the hypergraph construction, we build a location-based\nhyperedge and a content-based hyperedge for each viewport.

Upon resorting to a generalized\nlikelihood ratio test (GLRT), the design of the RIS phase shifts is formulated\nas the maximization of the probability of detection in the resolution cell\nunder inspection for a fixed probability of false alarm, and suitable\noptimization algorithms are proposed and discussed. Both the theoretical and\nthe numerical analysis clearly show the benefits, in terms of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the radar receiver, granted by the use of the\nRISs and shed light on the interplay among the key system parameters, such as\nthe radar-RIS distance, the RIS size, and location of the prospective target.
