    "abstract": "In the electronics industry, introducing Machine Learning (ML)-based\ntechniques can enhance Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) methods.\nHowever, the performance of ML models is highly dependent on their training\ndatasets. Particularly in the semiconductor industry, given the fact that the\nfabrication process of semiconductor devices is complicated and expensive, it\nis of great difficulty to obtain datasets with sufficient size and good\nquality. In this paper, we propose a strategy for improving ML-based device\nmodeling by data self-augmentation using variational autoencoder-based\ntechniques, where initially only a few experimental data points are required\nand TCAD tools are not essential. Taking a deep neural network-based prediction\ntask of the Ohmic resistance value in Gallium Nitride devices as an example, we\napply our proposed strategy to augment data points and achieve a reduction in\nthe mean absolute error of predicting the experimental results by up to 70%.\nThe proposed method could be easily modified for different tasks, rendering it\nof high interest to the semiconductor industry in general.",

    "abstract": "In order to increase the resilience of distribution systems against\nhigh-impact low-probability (HILP) events, it is important to prioritize assets\ndamaged by these events so that the lost loads, especially sensitive and\nimportant loads, can be recovered faster. For this reason, this paper discusses\nthe prioritization of electricity supply lines for scheduling and prioritizing\nrepair actions. To this end, the economic value of distribution system lines\nhas been considered as a criterion representing the sensitivity of the network\nto hurricanes. The modeling is based on value, in which the load value,\nlifetime-based failure probability of the poles, fragility curve, duration of\nline repair by the maintenance team, and the topology factor have been\nconsidered. This is so that the significance of the demand side, the failure\nextent and accessibility of the lines, the importance of time, and the network\nconfiguration are considered. The results provide an order of line priority for\nfault resolution, in which the topology factor has a larger effect. This\nmodeling has been tested on an IEEE 33-bus network.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of optical, electron, and scanning probe microscopies gives\nrise to large volumes of imaging data of objects as diversified as cells,\nbacteria, pollen, to nanoparticles and atoms and molecules. In most cases, the\nexperimental data streams contain images having arbitrary rotations and\ntranslations within the image. At the same time, for many cases, small amounts\nof labeled data are available in the form of prior published results, image\ncollections, and catalogs, or even theoretical models. Here we develop an\napproach that allows generalizing from a small subset of labeled data with a\nweak orientational disorder to a large unlabeled dataset with a much stronger\norientational (and positional) disorder, i.e., it performs a classification of\nimage data given a small number of examples even in the presence of a\ndistribution shift between the labeled and unlabeled parts. This approach is\nbased on the semi-supervised rotationally invariant variational autoencoder\n(ss-rVAE) model consisting of the encoder-decoder \"block\" that learns a\nrotationally (and translationally) invariant continuous latent representation\nof data and a classifier that encodes data into a finite number of discrete\nclasses. The classifier part of the trained ss-rVAE inherits the rotational\n(and translational) invariances and can be deployed independently of the other\nparts of the model. The performance of the ss-rVAE is illustrated using the\nsynthetic data sets with known factors of variation. We further demonstrate its\napplication for experimental data sets of nanoparticles, creating nanoparticle\nlibraries and disentangling the representations defining the physical factors\nof variation in the data.

    "title": "Transmission Failure Analysis of Multi-Protection Routing in Data Center  Networks with Heterogeneous Edge-Core Servers",
    "abstract": "The recently proposed RCube network is a cube-based server-centric data\ncenter network (DCN), including two types of heterogeneous servers, called core\nand edge servers. Remarkably, it takes the latter as backup servers to deal\nwith server failures and thus achieve high availability. This paper first\npoints out that RCube is suitable as a candidate topology of DCNs for edge\ncomputing. Three transmission types are among core and edge servers based on\nthe demand for applications' computation and instant response. We then employ\nprotection routing to analyze the transmission failure of RCube DCNs. Unlike\ntraditional protection routing, which only tolerates a single link or node\nfailure, we use the multi-protection routing scheme to improve fault-tolerance\ncapability. To configure a protection routing in a network, according to\nTapolcai's suggestion, we need to construct two completely independent spanning\ntrees (CISTs). A logic graph of RCube, denoted by $L$-$RCube(n,m,k)$, is a\nnetwork with a recursive structure. Each basic building element consists of $n$\ncore servers and $m$ edge servers, where the order $k$ is the number of\nrecursions applied in the structure. In this paper, we provide algorithms to\nconstruct $\\min\\{n,\\lfloor(n+m)/2\\rfloor\\}$ CISTs in $L$-$RCube(n,m,k)$ for\n$n+m\\geqslant 4$ and $n>1$. From a combination of the multiple CISTs, we can\nconfigure the desired multi-protection routing. In our simulation, we configure\nup to 10 protection routings for RCube DCNs. As far as we know, in past\nresearch, there were at most three protection routings developed in other\nnetwork structures. Finally, we summarize some crucial analysis viewpoints\nabout the transmission efficiency of DCNs with heterogeneous edge-core servers\nfrom the simulation results.",

    "abstract": "The abundance of training data is not guaranteed in various supervised\nlearning applications. One of these situations is the post-earthquake regional\ndamage assessment of buildings. Querying the damage label of each building\nrequires a thorough inspection by experts, and thus, is an expensive task. A\npractical approach is to sample the most informative buildings in a sequential\nlearning scheme. Active learning methods recommend the most informative cases\nthat are able to maximally reduce the generalization error. The information\ntheoretic measure of mutual information (MI) is one of the most effective\ncriteria to evaluate the effectiveness of the samples in a pool-based sample\nselection scenario. However, the computational complexity of the standard MI\nalgorithm prevents the utilization of this method on large datasets. A local\nkernels strategy was proposed to reduce the computational costs, but the\nadaptability of the kernels to the observed labels was not considered in the\noriginal formulation of this strategy. In this article, an adaptive local\nkernels methodology is developed that allows for the conformability of the\nkernels to the observed output data while enhancing the computational\ncomplexity of the standard MI algorithm. The proposed algorithm is developed to\nwork on a Gaussian process regression (GPR) framework, where the kernel\nhyperparameters are updated after each label query using the maximum likelihood\nestimation. In the sequential learning procedure, the updated hyperparameters\ncan be used in the MI kernel matrices to improve the sample suggestion\nperformance. The advantages are demonstrated on a simulation of the 2018\nAnchorage, AK, earthquake. It is shown that while the proposed algorithm\nenables GPR to reach acceptable performance with fewer training data, the\ncomputational demands remain lower than the standard local kernels strategy.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method for coarse camera pose computation which\nis robust to viewing conditions and does not require a detailed model of the\nscene. This method meets the growing need of easy deployment of robotics or\naugmented reality applications in any environments, especially those for which\nno accurate 3D model nor huge amount of ground truth data are available. It\nexploits the ability of deep learning techniques to reliably detect objects\nregardless of viewing conditions. Previous works have also shown that\nabstracting the geometry of a scene of objects by an ellipsoid cloud allows to\ncompute the camera pose accurately enough for various application needs. Though\npromising, these approaches use the ellipses fitted to the detection bounding\nboxes as an approximation of the imaged objects. In this paper, we go one step\nfurther and propose a learning-based method which detects improved elliptic\napproximations of objects which are coherent with the 3D ellipsoid in terms of\nperspective projection. Experiments prove that the accuracy of the computed\npose significantly increases thanks to our method and is more robust to the\nvariability of the boundaries of the detection boxes.

    "title": "Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning by Online Constrained  K-Means",
    "abstract": "Cluster discrimination is an effective pretext task for unsupervised\nrepresentation learning, which often consists of two phases: clustering and\ndiscrimination. Clustering is to assign each instance a pseudo label that will\nbe used to learn representations in discrimination. The main challenge resides\nin clustering since many prevalent clustering methods (e.g., k-means) have to\nrun in a batch mode that goes multiple iterations over the whole data.\nRecently, a balanced online clustering method, i.e., SwAV, is proposed for\nrepresentation learning. However, the assignment is optimized within only a\nsmall subset of data, which can be suboptimal. To address these challenges, we\nfirst investigate the objective of clustering-based representation learning\nfrom the perspective of distance metric learning. Based on this, we propose a\nnovel clustering-based pretext task with online \\textbf{Co}nstrained\n\\textbf{K}-m\\textbf{e}ans (\\textbf{CoKe}) to learn representations and\nrelations between instances simultaneously. Compared with the balanced\nclustering that each cluster has exactly the same size, we only constrain the\nminimum size of clusters to flexibly capture the inherent data structure. More\nimportantly, our online assignment method has a theoretical guarantee to\napproach the global optimum. Finally, two variance reduction strategies are\nproposed to make the clustering robust for different augmentations. Without\nkeeping representations of instances, the data is accessed in an online mode in\nCoKe while a single view of instances at each iteration is sufficient to\ndemonstrate a better performance than contrastive learning methods relying on\ntwo views. Extensive experiments on ImageNet verify the efficacy of our\nproposal. Code will be released.",

For a year, senior R&D staff members from\nover 70 biotech firms located in the Boston biotech cluster were polled and\ncommunication information about interaction with peers, universities and big\npharmaceutical companies was collected, as well as their geolocation tags.\nFindings: Location influences the amount of communication between firms, but\nnot their innovation success. Rather, what matters is communication intensity\nand recollection by others. In particular, there is evidence that rotating\nleadership - changing between a more active and passive communication style -\nis a predictor of innovative performance.\nPractical implications: Expensive real-estate investments can be replaced by\nmaintaining social ties. A more dynamic communication style and more diverse\nsocial ties are beneficial to innovation.\nOriginality-value: Compared to earlier work that has shown a connection\nbetween location, network and firm performance, this paper offers a more\ndifferentiated view; including a novel measure of communication style, using a\nunique data set and providing new insights for firms who want to shape their\ncommunication patterns to improve innovation, independently of their location.",

    "abstract": "GuessWhat?! is a two-player visual dialog guessing game where player A asks a\nsequence of yes/no questions (Questioner) and makes a final guess (Guesser)\nabout a target object in an image, based on answers from player B (Oracle).\nBased on this dialog history between the Questioner and the Oracle, a Guesser\nmakes a final guess of the target object. Previous baseline Oracle model\nencodes no visual information in the model, and it cannot fully understand\ncomplex questions about color, shape, relationships and so on. Most existing\nwork for Guesser encode the dialog history as a whole and train the Guesser\nmodels from scratch on the GuessWhat?! dataset.

Previous work for\nQuestioner introduces state tracking mechanism into the model, but it is\nlearned as a soft intermediates without any prior vision-linguistic insights.\nTo bridge these gaps, in this paper we propose Vilbert-based Oracle, Guesser\nand Questioner, which are all built on top of pretrained vision-linguistic\nmodel, Vilbert. We introduce two-way background/target fusion mechanism into\nVilbert-Oracle to account for both intra and inter-object questions.

    "abstract": "Temporal logic inference is the process of extracting formal descriptions of\nsystem behaviors from data in the form of temporal logic formulas. The existing\ntemporal logic inference methods mostly neglect uncertainties in the data,\nwhich results in limited applicability of such methods in real-world\ndeployments. In this paper, we first investigate the uncertainties associated\nwith trajectories of a system and represent such uncertainties in the form of\ninterval trajectories. We then propose two uncertainty-aware signal temporal\nlogic (STL) inference approaches to classify the undesired behaviors and\ndesired behaviors of a system. Instead of classifying finitely many\ntrajectories, we classify infinitely many trajectories within the interval\ntrajectories. In the first approach, we incorporate robust semantics of STL\nformulas with respect to an interval trajectory to quantify the margin at which\nan STL formula is satisfied or violated by the interval trajectory. The second\napproach relies on the first learning algorithm and exploits the decision tree\nto infer STL formulas to classify behaviors of a given system. The proposed\napproaches also work for non-separable data by optimizing the worst-case\nrobustness in inferring an STL formula. Finally, we evaluate the performance of\nthe proposed algorithms in two case studies, where the proposed algorithms show\nreductions in the computation time by up to four orders of magnitude in\ncomparison with the sampling-based baseline algorithms (for a dataset with 800\nsampled trajectories in total).",

    "title": "Elastic Shape Analysis of Brain Structures for Predictive Modeling of  PTSD",
    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence on the importance of brain morphology in\npredicting and classifying mental disorders. However, the vast majority of\ncurrent shape approaches rely heavily on vertex-wise analysis that may not\nsuccessfully capture complexities of subcortical structures. Additionally, the\npast works do not include interactions between these structures and exposure\nfactors. Predictive modeling with such interactions is of paramount interest in\nheterogeneous mental disorders such as PTSD, where trauma exposure interacts\nwith brain shape changes to influence behavior. We propose a comprehensive\nframework that overcomes these limitations by representing brain substructures\nas continuous parameterized surfaces and quantifying their shape differences\nusing elastic shape metrics. Using the elastic shape metric, we compute shape\nsummaries of subcortical data and represent individual shapes by their\nprincipal scores. These representations allow visualization tools that help\nlocalize changes when these PCs are varied. Subsequently, these PCs, the\nauxiliary exposure variables, and their interactions are used for regression\nmodeling. We apply our method to data from the Grady Trauma Project, where the\ngoal is to predict clinical measures of PTSD using shapes of brain\nsubstructures. Our analysis revealed considerably greater predictive power\nunder the elastic shape analysis than widely used approaches such as\nvertex-wise shape analysis and even volumetric analysis. It helped identify\nlocal deformations in brain shapes related to change in PTSD severity. To our\nknowledge, this is one of the first brain shape analysis approaches that can\nseamlessly integrate the pre-processing steps under one umbrella for improved\naccuracy and are naturally able to account for interactions between brain shape\nand additional covariates to yield superior predictive performance when\nmodeling clinical outcomes.",

We form good clusters by\nmaximizing the mutual information between empirical distribution on the inputs\nand the induced clustering labels for clustering objectives. We generate\nexplanations by solving an integer linear programming that generates concise\nand orthogonal descriptions for each cluster. Finally, we allow the explanation\nto inform better clustering by proposing a novel pairwise loss with\nself-generated constraints to maximize the clustering and explanation module's\nconsistency. Experimental results on public data demonstrate that our model\noutperforms competitive baselines in clustering performance while offering\nhigh-quality cluster-level explanations.",

Unlike the existing MMSE design that relies on 1-bit\nresolution, the proposed approach employs uniform phase quantization and the\nbounding step in the branch-and-bound method is different in terms of\nconsidering the most restrictive relaxation of the nonconvex problem, which is\nthen utilized for a suboptimal design also. Moreover, unlike prior studies, we\npropose three different soft detection methods and an iterative detection and\ndecoding scheme that allow the utilization of channel coding in conjunction\nwith low-resolution precoding. Besides an exact approach for computing the\nextrinsic information, we propose two approximations with reduced computational\ncomplexity. Numerical simulations show that utilizing the MMSE criterion\ninstead of the established maximum-minimum distance to the decision threshold\nyields a lower bit-error-rate in many scenarios. Furthermore, when using the\nMMSE criterion, a smaller number of bound evaluations in the branch-and-bound\nmethod is required for low and medium SNR. Finally, results based on an LDPC\nblock code indicate that the receive processing schemes yield a lower\nbit-error-rate compared to the conventional design.",

    "abstract": "Salient human detection (SHD) in dynamic 360{\\deg} immersive videos is of\ngreat importance for various applications such as robotics, inter-human and\nhuman-object interaction in augmented reality. However, 360{\\deg} video SHD has\nbeen seldom discussed in the computer vision community due to a lack of\ndatasets with large-scale omnidirectional videos and rich annotations. To this\nend, we propose SHD360, the first 360{\\deg} video SHD dataset collecting\nvarious real-life daily scenes, providing six-level hierarchical annotations\nfor 6,268 key frames uniformly sampled from 37,403 omnidirectional video frames\nat 4K resolution. Specifically, each collected key frame is labeled with a\nsuper-class, a sub-class, associated attributes (e.g., geometrical distortion),\nbounding boxes and per-pixel object-/instance-level masks. As a result, our\nSHD360 contains totally 16,238 salient human instances with manually annotated\npixel-wise ground truth. Since so far there is no method proposed for 360{\\deg}\nSHD, we systematically benchmark 11 representative state-of-the-art salient\nobject detection (SOD) approaches on our SHD360, and explore key issues derived\nfrom extensive experimenting results. We hope our proposed dataset and\nbenchmark could serve as a good starting point for advancing human-centric\nresearches towards 360{\\deg} panoramic data. Our dataset and benchmark will be\npublicly available at https://github.com/PanoAsh/SHD360.",

    "abstract": "The estimation of entropy rates for stationary discrete-valued stochastic\nprocesses is a well studied problem in information theory. However, estimating\nthe entropy rate for stationary continuous-valued stochastic processes has not\nreceived as much attention. In fact, many current techniques are not able to\naccurately estimate or characterise the complexity of the differential entropy\nrate for strongly correlated processes, such as Fractional Gaussian Noise and\nARFIMA(0,d,0). To the point that some cannot even detect the trend of the\nentropy rate, e.g. when it increases/decreases, maximum, or asymptotic trends,\nas a function of their Hurst parameter. However, a recently developed technique\nprovides accurate estimates at a high computational cost. In this paper, we\ndefine a robust technique for non-parametrically estimating the differential\nentropy rate of a continuous valued stochastic process from observed data, by\nmaking an explicit link between the differential entropy rate and the Shannon\nentropy rate of a quantised version of the original data. Estimation is\nperformed by a Shannon entropy rate estimator, and then converted to a\ndifferential entropy rate estimate. We show that this technique inherits many\nimportant statistical properties from the Shannon entropy rate estimator. The\nestimator is able to provide better estimates than the defined relative\nmeasures and much quicker estimates than known absolute measures, for strongly\ncorrelated processes. Finally, we analyse the complexity of the estimation\ntechnique and test the robustness to non-stationarity, and show that none of\nthe current techniques are robust to non-stationarity, even if they are robust\nto strong correlations.",

We first analyze the quantize-forward\n(QF) relaying scheme with joint decoding (JD) at the MCBS. To maximize the rate\nregion, we optimize the quantization of all user data streams at the SCBS by\ndeveloping a novel water-filling algorithm that is based on the Descartes' rule\nof signs.

We further propose a new simplified scheme through Wyner-Ziv (WZ)\nbinning and time-division (TD) transmission at the SCBS, which allows not only\nsequential but also separate decoding of each user message at the MCBS. For\nthis new QF-WZTD scheme, the optimal quantization parameters are identical to\nthat of the QF-JD scheme while the phase durations are conveniently optimized\nas functions of the quantization parameters.

    "abstract": "Towards the goal of robots performing robust and intelligent physical\ninteractions with people, it is crucial that robots are able to accurately\nsense the human body, follow trajectories around the body, and track human\nmotion. This study introduces a capacitive servoing control scheme that allows\na robot to sense and navigate around human limbs during close physical\ninteractions. Capacitive servoing leverages temporal measurements from a\nmulti-electrode capacitive sensor array mounted on a robot's end effector to\nestimate the relative position and orientation (pose) of a nearby human limb.\nCapacitive servoing then uses these human pose estimates from a data-driven\npose estimator within a feedback control loop in order to maneuver the robot's\nend effector around the surface of a human limb. We provide a design overview\nof capacitive sensors for human-robot interaction and then investigate the\nperformance and generalization of capacitive servoing through an experiment\nwith 12 human participants. The results indicate that multidimensional\ncapacitive servoing enables a robot's end effector to move proximally or\ndistally along human limbs while adapting to human pose. Using a\ncross-validation experiment, results further show that capacitive servoing\ngeneralizes well across people with different body size.",

    "abstract": "The cost aggregation strategy shows a crucial role in learning-based stereo\nmatching tasks, where 3D convolutional filters obtain state of the art but\nrequire intensive computation resources, while 2D operations need less GPU\nmemory but are sensitive to domain shift. In this paper, we decouple the 4D\ncubic cost volume used by 3D convolutional filters into sequential cost maps\nalong the direction of disparity instead of dealing with it at once by\nexploiting a recurrent cost aggregation strategy. Furthermore, a novel\nrecurrent module, Stacked Recurrent Hourglass (SRH), is proposed to process\neach cost map. Our hourglass network is constructed based on Gated Recurrent\nUnits (GRUs) and down/upsampling layers, which provides GRUs larger receptive\nfields. Then two hourglass networks are stacked together, while multi-scale\ninformation is processed by skip connections to enhance the performance of the\npipeline in textureless areas. The proposed architecture is implemented in an\nend-to-end pipeline and evaluated on public datasets, which reduces GPU memory\nconsumption by up to 56.1\\% compared with PSMNet using stacked hourglass 3D\nCNNs without the degradation of accuracy.

Although such threats can be detected by deep\nlearning as a service (DLaaS), deep neural networks as the weakest part of\nDLaaS are often deceived by the adversarial samples elaborated by attackers. In\nthis paper, we propose a new semi-black-box attack framework called\none-feature-each-iteration (OFEI) to craft Android adversarial samples. This\nframework modifies as few features as possible and requires less classifier\ninformation to fool the classifier. We conduct a controlled experiment to\nevaluate our OFEI framework by comparing it with the benchmark methods JSMF,\nGenAttack and pointwise attack. The experimental results show that our OFEI has\na higher misclassification rate of 98.25%. Furthermore, OFEI can extend the\ntraditional white-box attack methods in the image field, such as fast gradient\nsign method (FGSM) and DeepFool, to craft adversarial samples for Android.\nFinally, to enhance the security of DLaaS, we use two uncertainties of the\nBayesian neural network to construct the combined uncertainty, which is used to\ndetect adversarial samples and achieves a high detection rate of 99.28%.",

    "abstract": "Social media platforms promise to enable rich and vibrant conversations\nonline; however, their potential is often hindered by antisocial behaviors. In\nthis paper, we study the relationship between structure and toxicity in\nconversations on Twitter. We collect 1.18M conversations (58.5M tweets, 4.4M\nusers) prompted by tweets that are posted by or mention major news outlets over\none year and candidates who ran in the 2018 US midterm elections over four\nmonths. We analyze the conversations at the individual, dyad, and group level.\nAt the individual level, we find that toxicity is spread across many low to\nmoderately toxic users. At the dyad level, we observe that toxic replies are\nmore likely to come from users who do not have any social connection nor share\nmany common friends with the poster. At the group level, we find that toxic\nconversations tend to have larger, wider, and deeper reply trees, but sparser\nfollow graphs. To test the predictive power of the conversational structure, we\nconsider two prediction tasks. In the first prediction task, we demonstrate\nthat the structural features can be used to predict whether the conversation\nwill become toxic as early as the first ten replies. In the second prediction\ntask, we show that the structural characteristics of the conversation are also\npredictive of whether the next reply posted by a specific user will be toxic or\nnot. We observe that the structural and linguistic characteristics of the\nconversations are complementary in both prediction tasks. Our findings inform\nthe design of healthier social media platforms and demonstrate that models\nbased on the structural characteristics of conversations can be used to detect\nearly signs of toxicity and potentially steer conversations in a less toxic\ndirection.",

Due to the small-sensor footprint of the cameras and the vast\nareas to be surveyed, these AUVs can not feasibly full coverage of areas larger\nthan a few tens of thousands of square meters. Therefore AUV paths which sample\nsparsely, yet effectively, the survey areas are necessary. Broad scale acoustic\nbathymetric data is ready available over large areas, and often is a useful\nprior of seafloor cover. As such, prior bathymetry can be used to guide AUV\ndata collection. This research proposes methods for planning initial AUV\nsurveys that efficiently explore a feature space representation of the\nbathymetry, in order to sample from a diverse set of bathymetric terrain. This\nwill enable the AUV to visit areas that likely contain unique habitats and are\nrepresentative of the entire survey site. The suitability of these methods to\nplan AUV surveys is evaluated based on the coverage of the feature space and\nalso the ability to visit all classes of benthic habitat on the initial dive.\nThis is a valuable tool for AUV surveys as it increases the utility of initial\ndives.

Successful optical modulation approaches have been restricted\nfiber-coupled modulation with large coupling losses or interferometric\nmodulation with sub-cm range, and the precision gap between interferometric\nmethods and ToF methods is more than three orders of magnitudes. In this work,\nwe close this gap and propose a computational imaging method for all-optical\nfree-space correlation before photo-conversion that achieves micron-scale depth\nresolution with robustness to surface reflectance and ambient light with\nconventional silicon intensity sensors. To this end, we solve two technical\nchallenges: modulating at GHz rates and computational phase unwrapping. We\npropose an imaging approach with resonant polarization modulators and devise a\nnovel optical dual-pass frequency-doubling which achieves high modulation\ncontrast at more than 10GHz. At the same time, centimeter-wave modulation\ntogether with a small modulation bandwidth render existing phase unwrapping\nmethods ineffective. We tackle this problem with a neural phase unwrapping\nmethod that exploits that adjacent wraps are often highly correlated. We\nvalidate the proposed method in simulation and experimentally, where it\nachieves micron-scale depth precision. We demonstrate precise depth sensing\nindependently of surface texture and ambient light and compare against existing\nanalog demodulation methods, which we outperform across all tested scenarios.",

    "title": "Polarimetric Spatio-Temporal Light Transport Probing",
    "abstract": "Light can undergo complex interactions with multiple scene surfaces of\ndifferent material types before being reflected towards a detector. During this\ntransport, every surface reflection and propagation is encoded in the\nproperties of the photons that ultimately reach the detector, including travel\ntime, direction, intensity, wavelength and polarization. Conventional imaging\nsystems capture intensity by integrating over all other dimensions of the light\ninto a single quantity, hiding this rich scene information in the accumulated\nmeasurements. Existing methods can untangle these into their spatial and\ntemporal dimensions, fueling geometric scene understanding. However, examining\npolarimetric material properties jointly with geometric properties is an open\nchallenge that could enable unprecedented capabilities beyond geometric\nunderstanding, allowing to incorporate material-dependent semantics. In this\nwork, we propose a computational light-transport imaging method that captures\nthe spatially- and temporally-resolved complete polarimetric response of a\nscene. Our method hinges on a novel 7D tensor theory of light transport. We\ndiscover low-rank structures in the polarimetric tensor dimension and propose a\ndata-driven rotating ellipsometry method that learns to exploit redundancy of\nthe polarimetric structures. We instantiate our theory in two imaging\nprototypes: spatio-polarimetric imaging and coaxial temporal-polarimetric\nimaging. This allows us to decompose scene light transport into temporal,\nspatial, and complete polarimetric dimensions that unveil scene properties\nhidden to conventional methods. We validate the applicability of our method on\ndiverse tasks, including shape reconstruction with subsurface scattering,\nseeing through scattering medium, untangling multi-bounce light transport,\nbreaking metamerism with polarization, and spatio-polarimetric decomposition of\ncrystals.",

However, the previous work only considered the ideal balanced\ndataset, and the practical imbalanced dataset was rarely considered, which, on\nthe contrary, is of more significance for the application of GNN. Traditional\nmethods such as resampling, reweighting and synthetic samples that deal with\nimbalanced datasets are no longer applicable in GNN. Ensemble models can handle\nimbalanced datasets better compared with single estimator.

Experiments show that the AdaGCN model we proposed\nachieves better performance than GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, N-GCN and the most of\nadvanced reweighting and resampling methods on synthetic imbalanced datasets,\nwith an average improvement of 4.3%.

More specifically, we use\na flight-based network modeled as a general conditional random field capable of\nincorporating local constraints in the learning process. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that this approach yields significant improvements for the\nlarge-scale crew pairing problem (50,000 flights per month) over standard\napproaches, reducing the solution cost by 17% (a gain of millions of dollars)\nand the cost of global constraints by 97%.",

    "abstract": "Ground surface detection in point cloud is widely used as a key module in\nautonomous driving systems. Different from previous approaches which are mostly\ndeveloped for lidars with high beam resolution, e.g. Velodyne HDL-64, this\npaper proposes ground detection techniques applicable to much sparser point\ncloud captured by lidars with low beam resolution, e.g. Velodyne VLP-16. The\napproach is based on the RANSAC scheme of plane fitting. Inlier verification\nfor plane hypotheses is enhanced by exploiting the point-wise tangent, which is\na local feature available to compute regardless of the density of lidar beams.\nGround surface which is not perfectly planar is fitted by multiple\n(specifically 4 in our implementation) disjoint plane regions. By assuming\nthese plane regions to be rectanglar and exploiting the integral image\ntechnique, our approach approximately finds the optimal region partition and\nplane hypotheses under the RANSAC scheme with real-time computational\ncomplexity.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an effective method for fast and accurate scene\nparsing called Bidirectional Alignment Network (BiAlignNet). Previously, one\nrepresentative work BiSeNet~\\cite{bisenet} uses two different paths (Context\nPath and Spatial Path) to achieve balanced learning of semantics and details,\nrespectively. However, the relationship between the two paths is not well\nexplored. We argue that both paths can benefit each other in a complementary\nway. Motivated by this, we propose a novel network by aligning two-path\ninformation into each other through a learned flow field. To avoid the noise\nand semantic gaps, we introduce a Gated Flow Alignment Module to align both\nfeatures in a bidirectional way. Moreover, to make the Spatial Path learn more\ndetailed information, we present an edge-guided hard pixel mining loss to\nsupervise the aligned learning process.

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), as bio-inspired energy-efficient neural\nnetworks, have attracted great attentions from researchers and industry. The\nmost efficient way to train deep SNNs is through ANN-SNN conversion. However,\nthe conversion usually suffers from accuracy loss and long inference time,\nwhich impede the practical application of SNN. In this paper, we theoretically\nanalyze ANN-SNN conversion and derive sufficient conditions of the optimal\nconversion. To better correlate ANN-SNN and get greater accuracy, we propose\nRate Norm Layer to replace the ReLU activation function in source ANN training,\nenabling direct conversion from a trained ANN to an SNN. Moreover, we propose\nan optimal fit curve to quantify the fit between the activation value of source\nANN and the actual firing rate of target SNN. We show that the inference time\ncan be reduced by optimizing the upper bound of the fit curve in the revised\nANN to achieve fast inference. Our theory can explain the existing work on fast\nreasoning and get better results. The experimental results show that the\nproposed method achieves near loss less conversion with VGG-16,\nPreActResNet-18, and deeper structures. Moreover, it can reach 8.6x faster\nreasoning performance under 0.265x energy consumption of the typical method.\nThe code is available at\nhttps://github.com/DingJianhao/OptSNNConvertion-RNL-RIL.",

This frequency\nprinciple sheds light on a high-frequency curse of DNNs -- difficult to learn\nhigh-frequency information. Inspired by the frequency principle, a series of\nworks are devoted to develop algorithms for overcoming the high-frequency\ncurse. A natural question arises: what is the upper limit of the decaying rate\nw.r.t. frequency when one trains a DNN? In this work, our theory, confirmed by\nnumerical experiments, suggests that there is a critical decaying rate w.r.t.\nfrequency in DNN training. Below the upper limit of the decaying rate, the DNN\ninterpolates the training data by a function with a certain regularity.\nHowever, above the upper limit, the DNN interpolates the training data by a\ntrivial function, i.e., a function is only non-zero at training data points.\nOur results indicate a better way to overcome the high-frequency curse is to\ndesign a proper pre-condition approach to shift high-frequency information to\nlow-frequency one, which coincides with several previous developed algorithms\nfor fast learning high-frequency information.

    "abstract": "Deep learning affords enormous opportunities to augment the armamentarium of\nbiomedical imaging, albeit its design and implementation have potential flaws.\nFundamentally, most deep learning models are driven entirely by data without\nconsideration of any prior knowledge, which dramatically increases the\ncomplexity of neural networks and limits the application scope and model\ngeneralizability. Here we establish a geometry-informed deep learning framework\nfor ultra-sparse 3D tomographic image reconstruction. We introduce a novel\nmechanism for integrating geometric priors of the imaging system. We\ndemonstrate that the seamless inclusion of known priors is essential to enhance\nthe performance of 3D volumetric computed tomography imaging with ultra-sparse\nsampling. The study opens new avenues for data-driven biomedical imaging and\npromises to provide substantially improved imaging tools for various clinical\nimaging and image-guided interventions.",

A\npalindromic substring $w$ of a string $T$ is called a minimal unique\npalindromic substring (MUPS) of $T$ if $w$ occurs only once in $T$ and any\nproper palindromic substring of $w$ occurs at least twice in $T$. MUPSs are\nutilized for answering the shortest unique palindromic substring problem, which\nis motivated by molecular biology [Inoue et al., 2018]. Given a string $T$ of\nlength $n$, all MUPSs of $T$ can be computed in $O(n)$ time. In this paper, we\nstudy the problem of updating the set of MUPSs when a character in the input\nstring $T$ is substituted by another character. We first analyze the number $d$\nof changes of MUPSs when a character is substituted, and show that $d$ is in\n$O(\\log n)$. Further, we present an algorithm that uses $O(n)$ time and space\nfor preprocessing, and updates the set of MUPSs in $O(\\log\\sigma + (\\log\\log\nn)^2 + d)$ time where $\\sigma$ is the alphabet size.

    "abstract": "In wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs), most of researches address\nenergy scarcity by introducing one or multiple ground mobile vehicles to\nrecharge energy-hungry sensor nodes. The charging efficiency is limited by the\nmoving speed of ground chargers and rough environments, especially in\nlarge-scale scenarios or challenging scenarios such as separate islands. To\naddress the limitations, some researchers consider replacing ground mobile\nchargers with lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to support extremely\nlarge-scale scenarios, because of the UAV moving at higher speed without\ngeographical limitation. Moreover, multiple automatic landing wireless charging\nPADs are deployed in the network to recharge UAVs automatically. In this work,\nwe investigate the problem of introducing the minimal number of PADs in\nUAV-based WRSNs. We propose a novel and adaptive PAD deployment scheme named\nCDC & DSC that can adapt to arbitrary locations of the base station, arbitrary\ngeographic distributions of sensor nodes, and arbitrary sizes of network areas.\nIn the proposed scheme, we first obtain an initial PAD deployment solution by\nclustering nodes in geographic locations. Then, we propose a center shift\ncombining algorithm to optimize this solution by shifting the location of PADs\nand attempting to merge the adjacent PADs. The simulation results show that\ncompared to existing algorithms, our proposed scheme can use fewer PADs to\ncharge the whole network.",

In effect, we show how curriculum learning, from simple to complex\ntasks, works in Sokoban.

In this paper, we introduce the Stereo\nBird's Eye ViewNetwork (SBEVNet), a novel supervised end-to-end framework for\nestimation of bird's eye view layout from a pair of stereo images. Although our\nnetwork reuses some of the building blocks from the state-of-the-art deep\nlearning networks for disparity estimation, we show that explicit depth\nestimation is neither sufficient nor necessary. Instead, the learning of a good\ninternal bird's eye view feature representation is effective for layout\nestimation. Specifically, we first generate a disparity feature volume using\nthe features of the stereo images and then project it to the bird's eye view\ncoordinates. This gives us coarse-grained information about the scene\nstructure. We also apply inverse perspective mapping (IPM) to map the input\nimages and their features to the bird's eye view. This gives us fine-grained\ntexture information. Concatenating IPM features with the projected feature\nvolume creates a rich bird's eye view representation which is useful for\nspatial reasoning. We use this representation to estimate the BEV semantic map.\nAdditionally, we show that using the IPM features as a supervisory signal for\nstereo features can give an improvement in performance.

    "abstract": "Studying distributed computing through the lens of algebraic topology has\nbeen the source of many significant breakthroughs during the last two decades,\nespecially in the design of lower bounds or impossibility results for\ndeterministic algorithms. This paper aims at studying randomized synchronous\ndistributed computing through the lens of algebraic topology. We do so by\nstudying the wide class of (input-free) symmetry-breaking tasks, e.g., leader\nelection, in synchronous fault-free anonymous systems. We show that it is\npossible to redefine solvability of a task \"locally\", i.e., for each simplex of\nthe protocol complex individually, without requiring any global consistency.\nHowever, this approach has a drawback: it eliminates the topological aspect of\nthe computation, since a single facet has a trivial topological structure. To\novercome this issue, we introduce a \"projection\" $\\pi$ of both protocol and\noutput complexes, where every simplex $\\sigma$ is mapped to a complex\n$\\pi(\\sigma)$; the later has a rich structure that replaces the structure we\nlost by considering one single facet at a time.\nTo show the significance and applicability of our topological approach, we\nderive necessary and sufficient conditions for solving leader election in\nsynchronous fault-free anonymous shared-memory and message-passing models. In\nboth models, we consider scenarios in which there might be correlations between\nthe random values provided to the nodes. In particular, different parties might\nhave access to the same randomness source so their randomness is not\nindependent but equal.

We have analysed in detailed the impact of training\nutterance partitioning in speaker recognition performance under GMM-SVM\nframework. We further investigate the reason why the utterance partitioning is\nimportant for boosting speaker recognition performance. We have also shown in\nwhich case the utterance partitioning could be useful and where not. Our study\nhas revealed that utterance partitioning does not reduce the data imbalance\nproblem of the GMM-SVM classifier as claimed in earlier study. Apart from\nthese, we also discuss issues related to the impact of parameters such as\nnumber of Gaussians, supervector length, amount of splitting required for\nobtaining better performance in short and long duration test conditions from\nspeech duration perspective. We have performed the experiments with telephone\nspeech from POLYCOST corpus consisting of 130 speakers.",

    "abstract": "Error-bounded lossy compression is becoming an indispensable technique for\nthe success of today's scientific projects with vast volumes of data produced\nduring the simulations or instrument data acquisitions. Not only can it\nsignificantly reduce data size, but it also can control the compression errors\nbased on user-specified error bounds. Autoencoder (AE) models have been widely\nused in image compression, but few AE-based compression approaches support\nerror-bounding features, which are highly required by scientific applications.\nTo address this issue, we explore using convolutional autoencoders to improve\nerror-bounded lossy compression for scientific data, with the following three\nkey contributions. (1) We provide an in-depth investigation of the\ncharacteristics of various autoencoder models and develop an error-bounded\nautoencoder-based framework in terms of the SZ model. (2) We optimize the\ncompression quality for main stages in our designed AE-based error-bounded\ncompression framework, fine-tuning the block sizes and latent sizes and also\noptimizing the compression efficiency of latent vectors. (3) We evaluate our\nproposed solution using five real-world scientific datasets and comparing them\nwith six other related works. Experiments show that our solution exhibits a\nvery competitive compression quality from among all the compressors in our\ntests. In absolute terms, it can obtain a much better compression quality (100%\n~ 800% improvement in compression ratio with the same data distortion) compared\nwith SZ2.1 and ZFP in cases with a high compression ratio.",

    "abstract": "Detecting human-object interactions (HOI) is an important step toward a\ncomprehensive visual understanding of machines. While detecting non-temporal\nHOIs (e.g., sitting on a chair) from static images is feasible, it is unlikely\neven for humans to guess temporal-related HOIs (e.g., opening/closing a door)\nfrom a single video frame, where the neighboring frames play an essential role.\nHowever, conventional HOI methods operating on only static images have been\nused to predict temporal-related interactions, which is essentially guessing\nwithout temporal contexts and may lead to sub-optimal performance. In this\npaper, we bridge this gap by detecting video-based HOIs with explicit temporal\ninformation. We first show that a naive temporal-aware variant of a common\naction detection baseline does not work on video-based HOIs due to a\nfeature-inconsistency issue. We then propose a simple yet effective\narchitecture named Spatial-Temporal HOI Detection (ST-HOI) utilizing temporal\ninformation such as human and object trajectories, correctly-localized visual\nfeatures, and spatial-temporal masking pose features. We construct a new video\nHOI benchmark dubbed VidHOI where our proposed approach serves as a solid\nbaseline.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, multi-view learning technologies for various applications\nhave attracted a surge of interest. Due to more compatible and complementary\ninformation from multiple views, existing multi-view methods could achieve more\npromising performance than conventional single-view methods in most situations.\nHowever, there are still no sufficient researches on the unified framework in\nexisting multi-view works. Meanwhile, how to efficiently integrate multi-view\ninformation is still full of challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmulti-view learning framework, which aims to leverage most existing graph\nembedding works into a unified formula via introducing the graph consensus\nterm. In particular, our method explores the graph structure in each view\nindependently to preserve the diversity property of graph embedding methods.\nMeanwhile, we choose heterogeneous graphs to construct the graph consensus term\nto explore the correlations among multiple views jointly. To this end, the\ndiversity and complementary information among different views could be\nsimultaneously considered. Furthermore, the proposed framework is utilized to\nimplement the multi-view extension of Locality Linear Embedding, named\nMulti-view Locality Linear Embedding (MvLLE), which could be efficiently solved\nby applying the alternating optimization strategy. Empirical validations\nconducted on six benchmark datasets can show the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, new contributions to requirements-based testing with\ndeterministic finite state machines are presented. Elementary requirements are\nspecified as triples consisting of a state in the reference model, an input,\nand the expected reaction of the system under test defined by a set of\nadmissible outputs, allowing for different implementation variants. Composite\nrequirements are specified as collections of elementary ones. Two\nrequirements-driven test generation strategies are introduced, and their fault\ncoverage guarantees are proven. The first is exhaustive in the sense that it\nproduces test suites guaranteeing requirements satisfaction if the test suite\nis passed. If the test suite execution fails for a given implementation,\nhowever, this does not imply that the requirement has been violated. Instead,\nthe failure may indicate an arbitrary violation of I/O-equivalence, which could\nbe unrelated to the requirement under test. The second strategy is complete in\nthe sense that it produces test suites guaranteeing requirements satisfaction\nif and only if the suite is passed. Complexity considerations indicate that for\npractical application, the first strategy should be preferred to the second.\nTypical application scenarios for this approach are safety-critical systems,\nwhere safety requirements should be tested with maximal thoroughness, while\nuser requirements might be checked with lesser effort, using conventional\ntesting heuristics.",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot action recognition can recognize samples of unseen classes that are\nunavailable in training by exploring common latent semantic representation in\nsamples. However, most methods neglected the connotative relation and\nextensional relation between the action classes, which leads to the poor\ngeneralization ability of the zero-shot learning. Furthermore, the learned\nclassifier incline to predict the samples of seen class, which leads to poor\nclassification performance. To solve the above problems, we propose a two-stage\ndeep neural network for zero-shot action recognition, which consists of a\nfeature generation sub-network serving as the sampling stage and a graph\nattention sub-network serving as the classification stage. In the sampling\nstage, we utilize a generative adversarial networks (GAN) trained by action\nfeatures and word vectors of seen classes to synthesize the action features of\nunseen classes, which can balance the training sample data of seen classes and\nunseen classes. In the classification stage, we construct a knowledge graph\n(KG) based on the relationship between word vectors of action classes and\nrelated objects, and propose a graph convolution network (GCN) based on\nattention mechanism, which dynamically updates the relationship between action\nclasses and objects, and enhances the generalization ability of zero-shot\nlearning. In both stages, we all use word vectors as bridges for feature\ngeneration and classifier generalization from seen classes to unseen classes.\nWe compare our method with state-of-the-art methods on UCF101 and HMDB51\ndatasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method improves the\nclassification performance of the trained classifier and achieves higher\naccuracy.",

In this work, we present coVRage, a beamforming\nsolution tailored for VR HMDs.

    "abstract": "Few-Shot Learning (FSL) algorithms have made substantial progress in learning\nnovel concepts with just a handful of labelled data. To classify query\ninstances from novel classes encountered at test-time, they only require a\nsupport set composed of a few labelled samples. FSL benchmarks commonly assume\nthat those queries come from the same distribution as instances in the support\nset. However, in a realistic set-ting, data distribution is plausibly subject\nto change, a situation referred to as Distribution Shift (DS). The present work\naddresses the new and challenging problem of Few-Shot Learning under\nSupport/Query Shift (FSQS) i.e., when support and query instances are sampled\nfrom related but different distributions. Our contributions are the following.\nFirst, we release a testbed for FSQS, including datasets, relevant baselines\nand a protocol for a rigorous and reproducible evaluation. Second, we observe\nthat well-established FSL algorithms unsurprisingly suffer from a considerable\ndrop in accuracy when facing FSQS, stressing the significance of our study.\nFinally, we show that transductive algorithms can limit the inopportune effect\nof DS. In particular, we study both the role of Batch-Normalization and Optimal\nTransport (OT) in aligning distributions, bridging Unsupervised Domain\nAdaptation with FSL. This results in a new method that efficiently combines OT\nwith the celebrated Prototypical Networks. We bring compelling experiments\ndemonstrating the advantage of our method.

A diverse set of results are\npresented that address the case when the input matrix has sufficiently low\ncoherence (thus removing the $\\log^2 d$ factor dependence in $m$, in the\nlow-coherence result of Bourgain et al (2015) at the expense of a smaller\ncoherence requirement); how this coherence changes with the number $s$ of\ncolumn nonzeros (allowing a scaling of $\\sqrt{s}$ of the coherence bound), or\nis reduced through suitable transformations (when considering hashed -- instead\nof subsampled -- coherence reducing transformations such as randomised\nHadamard). Secondly, we apply these general hashing sketching results to the\nspecial case of Linear Least Squares (LLS), and develop Ski-LLS, a generic\nsoftware package for these problems, that builds upon and improves the\nBlendenpik solver on dense input and the (sequential) LSRN performance on\nsparse problems. In addition to the hashing sketching improvements, we add\nsuitable linear algebra tools for rank-deficient and for sparse problems that\nlead Ski-LLS to outperform not only sketching-based routines on randomly\ngenerated input, but also state of the art direct solver SPQR and iterative\ncode HSL on certain subsets of the sparse Florida matrix collection; namely, on\nleast squares problems that are significantly overdetermined, or moderately\nsparse, or difficult.",

    "abstract": "Modelling, simulation, and forecasting offer a means of facilitating better\nplanning and decision-making. These quantitative approaches can add value\nbeyond traditional methods that do not rely on data and are particularly\nrelevant for public transportation. Lagos is experiencing rapid urbanization\nand currently has a population of just under 15 million. Both long waiting\ntimes and uncertain travel times has driven many people to acquire their own\nvehicle or use alternative modes of transport. This has significantly increased\nthe number of vehicles on the roads leading to even more traffic and greater\ntraffic congestion. This paper investigates urban travel demand in Lagos and\nexplores passenger dynamics in time and space. Using individual commuter trip\ndata from tickets purchased from the Lagos State Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), the\ndemand patterns through the hours of the day, days of the week and bus stations\nare analysed. This study aims to quantify demand from actual passenger trips\nand estimate the impact that dynamic scheduling could have on passenger waiting\ntimes. Station segmentation is provided to cluster stations by their demand\ncharacteristics in order to tailor specific bus schedules. Intra-day public\ntransportation demand in Lagos BRT is analysed and predictions are compared.\nSimulations using fixed and dynamic bus scheduling demonstrate that the average\nwaiting time could be reduced by as much as 80%. The load curves, insights and\nthe approach developed will be useful for informing policymaking in Lagos and\nsimilar African cities facing the challenges of rapid urbanization.",

The vast majority of decentralized payment systems\nwork by achieving consensus on the state of the network; a natural question to\ntherefore ask is whether this consensus is necessary. In this paper, we\nformally define a model of payment systems, and present two main results. In\nTheorem 1, we show that even though there exists a single step black box\nreduction from Payment Systems to Byzantine Broadcast, there does not exist any\nblack box reduction in the other direction which is significantly better than a\ntrivial reduction. In Theorem 2, we show how to construct Payment Systems which\nonly require a very small number of messages to be sent per transaction. In\nparticular, global consensus about which transactions have occurred is not\nnecessary for payments in this model. We then show a relation between the\nconstruction in Theorem 2 and the Lightning Network, relating the formal model\nconstructions we have given to a practical algorithm proposed by the\ncryptocurrency community.",

Over the years ORCID has also become a useful source for\nstudying academic activities reported by researchers. Our objective in this\nresearch was to use ORCID to analyze one of these research activities: the\npublication of datasets. We illustrate how the identification of datasets that\nshared in researchers' ORCID profiles enables the study of the characteristics\nof the researchers who have produced them. To explore the relevance of ORCID to\nstudy data sharing practices we obtained all ORCID profiles reporting at least\none dataset in their \"works\" list, together with information related to the\nindividual researchers producing the datasets. The retrieved data was organized\nand analyzed in a SQL database hosted at CWTS. Our results indicate that\nDataCite is by far the most important data source for providing information\nabout datasets recorded in ORCID. There is also a substantial overlap between\nDataCite records with other repositories (Figshare, Dryad, and Zenodo). The\nanalysis of the distribution of researchers producing datasets shows that the\ntop six countries with more data producers, also have a relatively higher\npercentage of people who have produced datasets out of total researchers with\ndatasets than researchers in the total ORCID. By disciplines, researchers that\nbelong to the areas of Natural Sciences and Medicine and Life Sciences are\nthose with the largest amount of reported datasets. Finally, we observed that\nresearchers who have started their PhD around 2015 published their first\ndataset earlier that those researchers that started their PhD before.

To this end, we design and evaluate a mempool protocol,\nNarwhal, specializing in high-throughput reliable dissemination and storage of\ncausal histories of transactions. Narwhal tolerates an asynchronous network and\nmaintains its performance despite failures. We demonstrate that composing\n\\Narwhal with a partially synchronous consensus protocol (HotStuff) yields\nsignificantly better throughput even in the presence of faults. However, loss\nof liveness during view-changes can result in high latency. To achieve overall\ngood performance when faults occur we propose Tusk, a zero-message overhead\nasynchronous consensus protocol embedded within Narwhal. We demonstrate its\nhigh performance under a variety of configurations and faults. Further, Narwhal\nis designed to easily scale-out using multiple workers at each validator, and\nwe demonstrate that there is no foreseeable limit to the throughput we can\nachieve for consensus, with a few seconds latency. As a summary of results, on\na Wide Area Network (WAN), Hotstuff over Narwhal achieves 170,000 tx/sec with a\n2.5-sec latency instead of 1,800 tx/sec with 1-sec latency of Hotstuff.\nAdditional workers increase throughput linearly to 600,000 tx/sec without any\nlatency increase. Tusk achieves 140,000 tx/sec with 4 seconds latency or 20x\nbetter than the state-of-the-art asynchronous protocol.

The problem can be approached by using either\nengineered time-frequency features or raw audio as input. Modulation filter\nbank representations that have been actively researched as a basis for timbre\nperception have the potential to facilitate the extraction of perceptually\nsalient features. We explore end-to-end learned front-ends for audio\nrepresentation learning, ModNet and SincModNet, that incorporate a temporal\nmodulation processing block. The structure is effectively analogous to a\nmodulation filter bank, where the FIR filter center frequencies are learned in\na data-driven manner. The expectation is that a perceptually motivated filter\nbank can provide a useful representation for identifying music features. Our\nexperimental results provide a fully visualisable and interpretable front-end\ntemporal modulation decomposition of raw audio.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved remarkable success in computer\nvision (CV). However, training and inference of DNN models are both memory and\ncomputation intensive, incurring significant overhead in terms of energy\nconsumption and silicon area. In particular, inference is much more\ncost-sensitive than training because training can be done offline with powerful\nplatforms, while inference may have to be done on battery powered devices with\nconstrained form factors, especially for mobile or edge vision applications. In\norder to accelerate DNN inference, model quantization was proposed. However\nprevious works only focus on the quantization rate without considering the\nefficiency of operations. In this paper, we propose Dendrite-Tree based Neural\nNetwork (DTNN) for energy-efficient inference with table lookup operations\nenabled by activation quantization. In DTNN both costly weight access and\narithmetic computations are eliminated for inference. We conducted experiments\non various kinds of DNN models such as LeNet-5, MobileNet, VGG, and ResNet with\ndifferent datasets, including MNIST, Cifar10/Cifar100, SVHN, and ImageNet. DTNN\nachieved significant energy saving (19.4X and 64.9X improvement on ResNet-18\nand VGG-11 with ImageNet, respectively) with negligible loss of accuracy. To\nfurther validate the effectiveness of DTNN and compare with state-of-the-art\nlow energy implementation for edge vision, we design and implement DTNN based\nMLP image classifiers using off-the-shelf FPGAs.

    "abstract": "Early-stage plant density is an essential trait that determines the fate of a\ngenotype under given environmental conditions and management practices. The use\nof RGB images taken from UAVs may replace traditional visual counting in fields\nwith improved throughput, accuracy and access to plant localization. However,\nhigh-resolution (HR) images are required to detect small plants present at\nearly stages. This study explores the impact of image ground sampling distance\n(GSD) on the performances of maize plant detection at 3-5 leaves stage using\nFaster-RCNN. Data collected at HR (GSD=0.3cm) over 6 contrasted sites were used\nfor model training. Two additional sites with images acquired both at high and\nlow (GSD=0.6cm) resolution were used for model evaluation. Results show that\nFaster-RCNN achieved very good plant detection and counting (rRMSE=0.08)\nperformances when native HR images are used both for training and validation.\nSimilarly, good performances were observed (rRMSE=0.11) when the model is\ntrained over synthetic low-resolution (LR) images obtained by down-sampling the\nnative training HR images, and applied to the synthetic LR validation images.\nConversely, poor performances are obtained when the model is trained on a given\nspatial resolution and applied to another spatial resolution. Training on a mix\nof HR and LR images allows to get very good performances on the native HR\n(rRMSE=0.06) and synthetic LR (rRMSE=0.10) images. However, very low\nperformances are still observed over the native LR images (rRMSE=0.48), mainly\ndue to the poor quality of the native LR images. Finally, an advanced\nsuper-resolution method based on GAN (generative adversarial network) that\nintroduces additional textural information derived from the native HR images\nwas applied to the native LR validation images. Results show some significant\nimprovement (rRMSE=0.22) compared to bicubic up-sampling approach.",

    "abstract": "Drafting, i.e., the selection of a subset of items from a larger candidate\nset, is a key element of many games and related problems. It encompasses team\nformation in sports or e-sports, as well as deck selection in many modern card\ngames. The key difficulty of drafting is that it is typically not sufficient to\nsimply evaluate each item in a vacuum and to select the best items. The\nevaluation of an item depends on the context of the set of items that were\nalready selected earlier, as the value of a set is not just the sum of the\nvalues of its members - it must include a notion of how well items go together.\nIn this paper, we study drafting in the context of the card game Magic: The\nGathering. We propose the use of a contextual preference network, which learns\nto compare two possible extensions of a given deck of cards. We demonstrate\nthat the resulting network is better able to evaluate card decks in this game\nthan previous attempts.",

    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) extend the field's\nresearch scope towards a broader range of vision tasks and more diversified\nsearch spaces. While existing NAS methods mostly design architectures on a\nsingle task, algorithms that look beyond single-task search are surging to\npursue a more efficient and universal solution across various tasks. Many of\nthem leverage transfer learning and seek to preserve, reuse, and refine network\ndesign knowledge to achieve higher efficiency in future tasks. However, the\nenormous computational cost and experiment complexity of cross-task NAS are\nimposing barriers for valuable research in this direction. Existing NAS\nbenchmarks all focus on one type of vision task, i.e., classification. In this\nwork, we propose TransNAS-Bench-101, a benchmark dataset containing network\nperformance across seven tasks, covering classification, regression,\npixel-level prediction, and self-supervised tasks. This diversity provides\nopportunities to transfer NAS methods among tasks and allows for more complex\ntransfer schemes to evolve. We explore two fundamentally different types of\nsearch space: cell-level search space and macro-level search space. With 7,352\nbackbones evaluated on seven tasks, 51,464 trained models with detailed\ntraining information are provided.

One way to alleviate this problem is to\nacquire a strong inductive bias via meta-learning on similar tasks. In this\npaper, we show that such inductive bias can be learned from a flat collection\nof unlabeled images, and instantiated as transferable representations among\nseen and unseen classes. Specifically, we propose a novel part-based\nself-supervised representation learning scheme to learn transferable\nrepresentations by maximizing the similarity of an image to its discriminative\npart. To mitigate the overfitting in few-shot classification caused by data\nscarcity, we further propose a part augmentation strategy by retrieving extra\nimages from a base dataset. We conduct systematic studies on miniImageNet and\ntieredImageNet benchmarks. Remarkably, our method yields impressive results,\noutperforming the previous best unsupervised methods by 7.74% and 9.24% under\n5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings, which are comparable with\nstate-of-the-art supervised methods.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing scale and diversification of interaction behaviors in\nE-commerce, more and more researchers pay attention to multi-behavior\nrecommender systems that utilize interaction data of other auxiliary behaviors\nsuch as view and cart. To address these challenges in heterogeneous scenarios,\nnon-sampling methods have shown superiority over negative sampling methods.\nHowever, two observations are usually ignored in existing state-of-the-art\nnon-sampling methods based on binary regression: (1) users have different\npreference strengths for different items, so they cannot be measured simply by\nbinary implicit data; (2) the dependency across multiple behaviors varies for\ndifferent users and items. To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel\nnon-sampling learning framework named \\underline{C}riterion-guided\n\\underline{H}eterogeneous \\underline{C}ollaborative \\underline{F}iltering\n(CHCF). CHCF introduces both upper and lower bounds to indicate selection\ncriteria, which will guide user preference learning. Besides, CHCF integrates\ncriterion learning and user preference learning into a unified framework, which\ncan be trained jointly for the interaction prediction on target behavior. We\nfurther theoretically demonstrate that the optimization of Collaborative Metric\nLearning can be approximately achieved by CHCF learning framework in a\nnon-sampling form effectively.

It is inspired by the\nmulti-modes method of [7,8] and the ensemble method of [19] and extends those\nmethods into a more general and unified framework. The main idea of the\nframework is to reformulate the underlying problem into another problem with a\nparameter-independent diffusion coefficient and a parameter-dependent (and\nsolution-dependent) right-hand side, a fixed-point iteration is then employed\nto compute the solution of the reformulated problem. The main benefit of the\nproposed approach is that an efficient direct solver and a block Krylov\nsubspace iterative solver can be used at each iteration, allowing to reuse the\n$LU$ matrix factorization or to do an efficient matrix-matrix multiplication\nfor all parameters, which in turn results in significant computation saving.\nConvergence and rates of convergence are established for the iterative method\nboth at the variational continuous level and at the finite element discrete\nlevel under some structure conditions. Several strategies for establishing\nreformulations of parameter-dependent and random diffusion problems are\nproposed and their computational complexity is analyzed. Several 1-D and 2-D\nnumerical experiments are also provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the\nproposed iterative method and to validate the theoretical convergence results.",

    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis (SA) is an important research area in cognitive\ncomputation-thus in-depth studies of patterns of sentiment analysis are\nnecessary. At present, rich resource data-based SA has been well developed,\nwhile the more challenging and practical multi-source unsupervised SA (i.e. a\ntarget domain SA by transferring from multiple source domains) is seldom\nstudied. The challenges behind this problem mainly locate in the lack of\nsupervision information, the semantic gaps among domains (i.e., domain shifts),\nand the loss of knowledge. However, existing methods either lack the\ndistinguishable capacity of the semantic gaps among domains or lose private\nknowledge. To alleviate these problems, we propose a two-stage domain\nadaptation framework. In the first stage, a multi-task methodology-based\nshared-private architecture is employed to explicitly model the domain common\nfeatures and the domain-specific features for the labeled source domains. In\nthe second stage, two elaborate mechanisms are embedded in the shared private\narchitecture to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains. The first\nmechanism is a selective domain adaptation (SDA) method, which transfers\nknowledge from the closest source domain. And the second mechanism is a\ntarget-oriented ensemble (TOE) method, in which knowledge is transferred\nthrough a well-designed ensemble method. Extensive experiment evaluations\nverify that the performance of the proposed framework outperforms unsupervised\nstate-of-the-art competitors. What can be concluded from the experiments is\nthat transferring from very different distributed source domains may degrade\nthe target-domain performance, and it is crucial to choose the proper source\ndomains to transfer from.",

    "abstract": "Few-shot learning has been proposed and rapidly emerging as a viable means\nfor completing various tasks. Many few-shot models have been widely used for\nrelation learning tasks. However, each of these models has a shortage of\ncapturing a certain aspect of semantic features, for example, CNN on long-range\ndependencies part, Transformer on local features. It is difficult for a single\nmodel to adapt to various relation learning, which results in the high variance\nproblem. Ensemble strategy could be competitive on improving the accuracy of\nfew-shot relation extraction and mitigating high variance risks. This paper\nexplores an ensemble approach to reduce the variance and introduces fine-tuning\nand feature attention strategies to calibrate relation-level features. Results\non several few-shot relation learning tasks show that our model significantly\noutperforms the previous state-of-the-art models.",

    "abstract": "Cross-lingual speech adaptation aims to solve the problem of leveraging\nmultiple rich-resource languages to build models for a low-resource target\nlanguage. Since the low-resource language has limited training data, speech\nrecognition models can easily overfit. In this paper, we propose to use\nadapters to investigate the performance of multiple adapters for\nparameter-efficient cross-lingual speech adaptation. Based on our previous\nMetaAdapter that implicitly leverages adapters, we propose a novel algorithms\ncalled SimAdapter for explicitly learning knowledge from adapters. Our\nalgorithm leverages adapters which can be easily integrated into the\nTransformer structure.MetaAdapter leverages meta-learning to transfer the\ngeneral knowledge from training data to the test language. SimAdapter aims to\nlearn the similarities between the source and target languages during\nfine-tuning using the adapters. We conduct extensive experiments on\nfive-low-resource languages in Common Voice dataset. Results demonstrate that\nour MetaAdapter and SimAdapter methods can reduce WER by 2.98% and 2.55% with\nonly 2.5% and 15.5% of trainable parameters compared to the strong full-model\nfine-tuning baseline. Moreover, we also show that these two novel algorithms\ncan be integrated for better performance with up to 3.55% relative WER\nreduction.",

    "abstract": "Modern multi-document summarization (MDS) methods are based on transformer\narchitectures. They generate state of the art summaries, but lack\nexplainability. We focus on graph-based transformer models for MDS as they\ngained recent popularity. We aim to improve the explainability of the\ngraph-based MDS by analyzing their attention weights. In a graph-based MDS such\nas GraphSum, vertices represent the textual units, while the edges form some\nsimilarity graph over the units. We compare GraphSum's performance utilizing\ndifferent textual units, i. e., sentences versus paragraphs, on two news\nbenchmark datasets, namely WikiSum and MultiNews. Our experiments show that\nparagraph-level representations provide the best summarization performance.\nThus, we subsequently focus oAnalysisn analyzing the paragraph-level attention\nweights of GraphSum's multi-heads and decoding layers in order to improve the\nexplainability of a transformer-based MDS model. As a reference metric, we\ncalculate the ROUGE scores between the input paragraphs and each sentence in\nthe generated summary, which indicate source origin information via text\nsimilarity. We observe a high correlation between the attention weights and\nthis reference metric, especially on the the later decoding layers of the\ntransformer architecture.

    "abstract": "Many people consider news articles to be a reliable source of information on\ncurrent events. However, due to the range of factors influencing news agencies,\nsuch coverage may not always be impartial. Media bias, or slanted news\ncoverage, can have a substantial impact on public perception of events, and,\naccordingly, can potentially alter the beliefs and views of the public. The\nmain data gap in current research on media bias detection is a robust,\nrepresentative, and diverse dataset containing annotations of biased words and\nsentences. In particular, existing datasets do not control for the individual\nbackground of annotators, which may affect their assessment and, thus,\nrepresents critical information for contextualizing their annotations. In this\nposter, we present a matrix-based methodology to crowdsource such data using a\nself-developed annotation platform. We also present MBIC (Media Bias Including\nCharacteristics) - the first sample of 1,700 statements representing various\nmedia bias instances. The statements were reviewed by ten annotators each and\ncontain labels for media bias identification both on the word and sentence\nlevel. MBIC is the first available dataset about media bias reporting detailed\ninformation on annotator characteristics and their individual background. The\ncurrent dataset already significantly extends existing data in this domain\nproviding unique and more reliable insights into the perception of bias. In\nfuture, we will further extend it both with respect to the number of articles\nand annotators per article.",

Most previous works in this domain require human-created metadata of\nscreens (e.g. View Hierarchy) during inference, which unfortunately is often\nnot available or reliable enough for GUI understanding. Inspired by the\nimpressive success of Transformers in NLP tasks, targeting for purely\nvision-based GUI understanding, we extend the concepts of Words/Sentence to\nPixel-Words/Screen-Sentence, and propose a mobile GUI understanding\narchitecture: Pixel-Words to Screen-Sentence (PW2SS). In analogy to the\nindividual Words, we define the Pixel-Words as atomic visual components (text\nand graphic components), which are visually consistent and semantically clear\nacross screenshots of a large variety of design styles. The Pixel-Words\nextracted from a screenshot are aggregated into Screen-Sentence with a Screen\nTransformer proposed to model their relations. Since the Pixel-Words are\ndefined as atomic visual components, the ambiguity between their visual\nappearance and semantics is dramatically reduced. We are able to make use of\nmetadata available in training data to auto-generate high-quality annotations\nfor Pixel-Words. A dataset, RICO-PW, of screenshots with Pixel-Words\nannotations is built based on the public RICO dataset, which will be released\nto help to address the lack of high-quality training data in this area. We\ntrain a detector to extract Pixel-Words from screenshots on this dataset and\nachieve metadata-free GUI understanding during inference. We conduct\nexperiments and show that Pixel-Words can be well extracted on RICO-PW and well\ngeneralized to a new dataset, P2S-UI, collected by ourselves. The effectiveness\nof PW2SS is further verified in the GUI understanding tasks including relation\nprediction, clickability prediction, screen retrieval, and app type\nclassification.",

    "abstract": "Speakers communicate to influence their partner's beliefs and shape their\nactions. Belief- and action-based objectives have been explored independently\nin recent computational models, but it has been challenging to explicitly\ncompare or integrate them. Indeed, we find that they are conflated in standard\nreferential communication tasks. To distinguish these accounts, we introduce a\nnew paradigm called signaling bandits, generalizing classic Lewis signaling\ngames to a multi-armed bandit setting where all targets in the context have\nsome relative value. We develop three speaker models: a belief-oriented speaker\nwith a purely informative objective; an action-oriented speaker with an\ninstrumental objective; and a combined speaker which integrates the two by\ninducing listener beliefs that generally lead to desirable actions. We then\npresent a series of simulations demonstrating that grounding production choices\nin future listener actions results in relevance effects and flexible uses of\nnonliteral language. More broadly, our findings suggest that language games\nbased on richer decision problems are a promising avenue for insight into\nrational communication.",

    "abstract": "Creating intelligent systems capable of recognizing emotions is a difficult\ntask, especially when looking at emotions in animals. This paper describes the\nprocess of designing a \"proof of concept\" system to recognize emotions in\nhorses. This system is formed by two elements, a detector and a model. The\ndetector is a faster region-based convolutional neural network that detects\nhorses in an image. The second one, the model, is a convolutional neural\nnetwork that predicts the emotion of those horses. These two models were\ntrained with multiple images of horses until they achieved high accuracy in\ntheir tasks, creating therefore the desired system. 400 images of horses were\nused to train both the detector and the model while 80 were used to validate\nthe system. Once the two components were validated they were combined into a\ntestable system that would detect equine emotions based on established\nbehavioral ethograms indicating emotional affect through head, neck, ear,\nmuzzle, and eye position. The system showed an accuracy of between 69% and 74%\non the validation set, demonstrating that it is possible to predict emotions in\nanimals using autonomous intelligent systems. It is a first \"proof of concept\"\napproach that can be enhanced in many ways. Such a system has multiple\napplications including further studies in the growing field of animal emotions\nas well as in the veterinary field to determine the physical welfare of horses\nor other livestock.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of compressed sensing using a deep generative prior\nmodel and consider both linear and learned nonlinear sensing mechanisms, where\nthe nonlinear one involves either a fully connected neural network or a\nconvolutional neural network. Recently, it has been argued that the\ndistribution of natural images do not lie in a single manifold but rather lie\nin a union of several submanifolds. We propose a sparsity-driven latent space\nsampling (SDLSS) framework and develop a proximal meta-learning (PML) algorithm\nto enforce sparsity in the latent space. SDLSS allows the range-space of the\ngenerator to be considered as a union-of-submanifolds. We also derive the\nsample complexity bounds within the SDLSS framework for the linear measurement\nmodel. The results demonstrate that for a higher degree of compression, the\nSDLSS method is more efficient than the state-of-the-art method. We first\nconsider a comparison between linear and nonlinear sensing mechanisms on\nFashion-MNIST dataset and show that the learned nonlinear version is superior\nto the linear one. Subsequent comparisons with the deep compressive sensing\n(DCS) framework proposed in the literature are reported. We also consider the\neffect of the dimension of the latent space and the sparsity factor in\nvalidating the SDLSS framework. Performance quantification is carried out by\nemploying three objective metrics: peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),\nstructural similarity index metric (SSIM), and reconstruction error (RE).",

    "abstract": "Autonomous discovery and direct instruction are two extreme sources of\nlearning in children, but educational sciences have shown that intermediate\napproaches such as assisted discovery or guided play resulted in better\nacquisition of skills. When turning to Artificial Intelligence, the above\ndichotomy is translated into the distinction between autonomous agents which\nlearn in isolation and interactive learning agents which can be taught by\nsocial partners but generally lack autonomy. In between should stand teachable\nautonomous agents: agents learning from both internal and teaching signals to\nbenefit from the higher efficiency of assisted discovery. Such agents could\nlearn on their own in the real world, but non-expert users could drive their\nlearning behavior towards their expectations. More fundamentally, combining\nboth capabilities might also be a key step towards general intelligence. In\nthis paper we elucidate obstacles along this research line. First, we build on\na seminal work of Bruner to extract relevant features of the assisted discovery\nprocesses. Second, we describe current research on autotelic agents, i.e.\nagents equipped with forms of intrinsic motivations that enable them to\nrepresent, self-generate and pursue their own goals. We argue that autotelic\ncapabilities are paving the way towards teachable and autonomous agents.\nFinally, we adopt a social learning perspective on tutoring interactions and we\nhighlight some components that are currently missing to autotelic agents before\nthey can be taught by ordinary people using natural pedagogy, and we provide a\nlist of specific research questions that emerge from this perspective.",

However, prior works have mostly focused on point estimates\nwithout quantifying the uncertainty of the predictions. In high stakes domains,\nbeing able to generate probabilistic forecasts with confidence intervals is\ncritical to risk assessment and decision making. Hence, a systematic study of\nuncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for spatiotemporal forecasting is\nmissing in the community.

Through\nextensive experiments on real-world road network traffic, epidemics, and air\nquality forecasting tasks, we reveal the statistical and computational\ntrade-offs for different UQ methods: Bayesian methods are typically more robust\nin mean prediction, while confidence levels obtained from frequentist methods\nprovide more extensive coverage over data variations. Computationally, quantile\nregression type methods are cheaper for a single confidence interval but\nrequire re-training for different intervals.

To understand and detect this\ninteraction between phenotype and genotype is a fundamental step when\ntranslating precision medicine to clinical practice. The recent advances in the\nfield of machine learning is efficient to predict these interactions between\nabnormal human phenotypes and genes.\nMethods In this study, we developed a framework to predict links between\nhuman phenotype ontology (HPO) and genes. The annotation data from the\nheterogeneous knowledge resources i.e., orphanet, is used to parse human\nphenotype-gene associations. To generate the embeddings for the nodes (HPO &\ngenes), an algorithm called node2vec was used. It performs node sampling on\nthis graph based on random walks, then learns features over these sampled nodes\nto generate embeddings. These embeddings were used to perform the downstream\ntask to predict the presence of the link between these nodes using 5 different\nsupervised machine learning algorithms.\nResults: The downstream link prediction task shows that the Gradient Boosting\nDecision Tree based model (LightGBM) achieved an optimal AUROC 0.904 and AUCPR\n0.784.

For the\nlatter, the framework of contention resolution schemes (or CR schemes)\nintroduced by Chekuri, Vondrak, and Zenklusen, has become a general and\nsuccessful tool. A CR scheme takes a fractional point $x$ in a relaxation\npolytope, rounds each coordinate $x_i$ independently to get a possibly\nnon-feasible set, and then drops some elements in order to satisfy the\nindependence constraints. Intuitively, a CR scheme is $c$-balanced if every\nelement $i$ is selected with probability at least $c \\cdot x_i$.\nIt is known that general matroids admit a $(1-1/e)$-balanced CR scheme, and\nthat this is (asymptotically) optimal.

However, existing approaches to\nscheduling tasks in mobility platforms ignore fairness.\nWe introduce Mobius, a system that uses guided optimization to achieve both\nhigh throughput and fairness across customers. Mobius supports spatiotemporally\ndiverse and dynamic customer demands. It provides a principled method to\nnavigate inherent tradeoffs between fairness and throughput caused by shared\nmobility. Our evaluation demonstrates these properties, along with the\nversatility and scalability of Mobius, using traces gathered from ridesharing\nand aerial sensing applications. Our ridesharing case study shows that Mobius\ncan schedule more than 16,000 tasks across 40 customers and 200 vehicles in an\nonline manner.",

    "abstract": "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis suggests that an over-parametrized network\nconsists of \"lottery tickets\", and training a certain collection of them (i.e.,\na subnetwork) can match the performance of the full model. In this paper, we\nstudy such a collection of tickets, which is referred to as \"winning tickets\",\nin extremely over-parametrized models, e.g., pre-trained language models. We\nobserve that at certain compression ratios, generalization performance of the\nwinning tickets can not only match, but also exceed that of the full model. In\nparticular, we observe a phase transition phenomenon: As the compression ratio\nincreases, generalization performance of the winning tickets first improves\nthen deteriorates after a certain threshold. We refer to the tickets on the\nthreshold as \"super tickets\". We further show that the phase transition is task\nand model dependent -- as model size becomes larger and training data set\nbecomes smaller, the transition becomes more pronounced. Our experiments on the\nGLUE benchmark show that the super tickets improve single task fine-tuning by\n$0.9$ points on BERT-base and $1.0$ points on BERT-large, in terms of\ntask-average score.

We study the NP-hard temporal (s,z)-separation problem on\ntemporal graphs, which are graphs with fixed vertex sets but edge sets that\nchange over discrete time steps. We tackle this problem by restricting the\nlayers (i.e., graphs characterized by edges that are present at a certain point\nin time) to specific graph classes. We restrict the layers of the temporal\ngraphs to be either all split graphs or all permutation graphs (both being\nperfect graph classes) and provide both intractability and tractability\nresults. In particular, we show that in general the problem remains NP-hard\nboth on temporal split and temporal permutation graphs, but we also spot\npromising islands of fixed-parameter tractability particularly based on\nparameterizations that measure the amount of \"change over time\".",

To capture the dependencies at\ndifferent levels of granularity, this paper intuitively presents a unified\ntemporal action proposal generation framework with original Transformers,\ncalled TAPG Transformer, which consists of a Boundary Transformer and a\nProposal Transformer. Specifically, the Boundary Transformer captures long-term\ntemporal dependencies to predict precise boundary information and the Proposal\nTransformer learns the rich inter-proposal relationships for reliable\nconfidence evaluation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular\nbenchmarks: ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS14, and the results demonstrate that TAPG\nTransformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Equipped with the existing\naction classifier, our method achieves remarkable performance on the temporal\naction localization task. Codes and models will be available.",

    "abstract": "It is known that deep neural networks, trained for the classification of a\nnon-sensitive target attribute, can reveal sensitive attributes of their input\ndata; through features of different granularity extracted by the classifier.\nWe, taking a step forward, show that deep classifiers can be trained to\nsecretly encode a sensitive attribute of users' input data, at inference time,\ninto the classifier's outputs for the target attribute. An attack that works\neven if users have a white-box view of the classifier, and can keep all\ninternal representations hidden except for the classifier's estimation of the\ntarget attribute. We introduce an information-theoretical formulation of such\nadversaries and present efficient empirical implementations for training\nhonest-but-curious (HBC) classifiers based on this formulation: deep models\nthat can be accurate in predicting the target attribute, but also can utilize\ntheir outputs to secretly encode a sensitive attribute. Our evaluations on\nseveral tasks in real-world datasets show that a semi-trusted server can build\na classifier that is not only perfectly honest but also accurately curious. Our\nwork highlights a vulnerability that can be exploited by malicious machine\nlearning service providers to attack their user's privacy in several seemingly\nsafe scenarios; such as encrypted inferences, computations at the edge, or\nprivate knowledge distillation. We conclude by showing the difficulties in\ndistinguishing between standard and HBC classifiers and discussing potential\nproactive defenses against this vulnerability of deep classifiers.",

    "abstract": "Monocular (relative or metric) depth estimation is a critical task for\nvarious applications, such as autonomous vehicles, augmented reality and image\nediting. In recent years, with the increasing availability of mobile devices,\naccurate and mobile-friendly depth models have gained importance. Increasingly\naccurate models typically require more computational resources, which inhibits\nthe use of such models on mobile devices. The mobile use case is arguably the\nmost unrestricted one, which requires highly accurate yet mobile-friendly\narchitectures. Therefore, we try to answer the following question: How can we\nimprove a model without adding further complexity (i.e. parameters)? Towards\nthis end, we systematically explore the design space of a relative depth\nestimation model from various dimensions and we show, with key design choices\nand ablation studies, even an existing architecture can reach highly\ncompetitive performance to the state of the art, with a fraction of the\ncomplexity. Our study spans an in-depth backbone model selection process,\nknowledge distillation, intermediate predictions, model pruning and loss\nrebalancing. We show that our model, using only DIW as the supervisory dataset,\nachieves 0.1156 WHDR on DIW with 2.6M parameters and reaches 37 FPS on a mobile\nGPU, without pruning or hardware-specific optimization. A pruned version of our\nmodel achieves 0.1208 WHDR on DIW with 1M parameters and reaches 44 FPS on a\nmobile GPU.",

    "abstract": "In this era of 5G technology, the ever-increasing demands for high data rates\nlead researchers to develop hybrid satellite-terrestrial (HST) networks as a\nsubstitution to the conventional cellular terrestrial systems. Since an HST\nnetwork suffers from a masking effect which can be mitigated by adopting the\nterrestrial relaying strategy, in this work, we focus on wireless multicasting\nthrough an HST relaying net-work (HSTRN) in which a satellite sends messages to\nmultiple terrestrial nodes via multiple relays under the wiretapping efforts of\nmultiple eavesdroppers. Our concern is to protect the multicast messages from\nbeing eavesdropped taking advantage of the well-known opportunistic relaying\ntechnique. We consider the satellite links follow Shadowed Rician fading\nwhereas the terrestrial links undergo alpha-mu fading. The secrecy performance\nof the proposed HSTRN model is accomplished by deriving expressions for the\nprobability of nonzero secrecy multicast capacity, ergodic secrecy multicast\ncapacity, and secure outage probability for multicasting in closed-form.\nCapitalizing on the derived expressions, we analyze how a perfect secrecy level\ncan be preserved in spite of harsh channel conditions and also present a\nsecrecy trade-off in terms of the number of relays, multicast users, and\nmultiple eavesdroppers. Finally, the numerical analyses are corroborated via\nMonte-Carlo simulations.",

We use a lazily evaluated LPA* to\nrepair the cost-to-come inconsistencies of the relevant region of the current\nsearch tree based on the previous search results, and then we restrict the\nexpensive edge evaluations only to the current shortest subpath as in the GLS\nframework. The proposed algorithm is complete and correct in finding the\noptimal solution in the current graph, if one exists.

Finally, we show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared to\nthe standard LPA* and the GLS algorithms over consecutive search episodes in a\ndynamic environment. For each search, the proposed algorithm reduces the edge\nevaluations by a significant amount compared to the LPA*.

    "title": "No Deal: Investigating the Influence of Restricted Access to Elsevier  Journals on German Researchers' Publishing and Citing Behaviours",
    "abstract": "In 2014, a union of German research organisations established Projekt DEAL, a\nnational-level project to negotiate licensing agreements with large scientific\npublishers. Negotiations between DEAL and Elsevier began in 2016, and broke\ndown without a successful agreement in 2018; in this time, around 200 German\nresearch institutions cancelled their license agreements with Elsevier, leading\nElsevier to restrict journal access at those institutions from July 2018\nonwards. We investigated the effect of these access restrictions on\nresearchers' publishing and citing behaviours from a bibliometric perspective,\nusing a dataset of ~410,000 articles published by researchers at the affected\nDEAL institutions between 2012-2020. We further investigated these effects with\nrespect to the timing of contract cancellations with Elsevier, research\ndisciplines, collaboration patterns, and article open-access status. We find\nevidence for a decrease in Elsevier's market share of articles from DEAL\ninstitutions, from a peak of 25.3% in 2015 to 20.6% in 2020, with the largest\nyear-on-year market share decreases occurring in 2019 (-1.1%) and 2020 (-1.6%)\nfollowing the implementation of access restrictions. We also observe\nyear-on-year decreases in the proportion of citations made from articles\npublished by authors at DEAL institutions to articles in Elsevier journals\npost-2018, although the decrease is smaller (-0.4% in 2019 and -0.6% in 2020)\nthan changes in publishing volume. We conclude that Elsevier access\nrestrictions have led to some reduced willingness of researchers at DEAL\ninstitutions to publish their research in Elsevier journals, but that\nresearchers are not strongly affected in their ability to cite Elsevier\narticles, with the implication that researchers use a variety of other methods\n(e.g. interlibrary loans, sharing between colleagues, or \"shadow libraries\") to\naccess scientific literature.",

Among other things, we consider\nsilent labeling protocols, where eventually each agent reaches its final state\nand remains in it forever, as well as safe labeling protocols which can produce\na valid agent labeling in a finite number of interactions, and guarantee that\nat any step of the protocol no two agents have the same label. We first provide\na silent and safe protocol which uses only $n+5\\sqrt n +4$ states and draws\nlabels from the range $1,\\dots,n.$ . The expected number of interactions\nrequired by the protocol is $O(n^3).$ On the other hand, we show that any safe\nprotocol, as well as any silent protocol which provides a valid labeling with\nprobability $>1-\\frac 1n$, uses $\\ge n+\\sqrt n-1$ states. Hence, our protocol\nis almost state-optimal. We also present a generalization of the protocol to\ninclude a trade-off between the number of states and the expected number of\ninteractions.

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) allowed smart homes to improve the quality and the\ncomfort of our daily lives. However, these conveniences introduced several\nsecurity concerns that increase rapidly. IoT devices, smart home hubs, and\ngateway raise various security risks. The smart home gateways act as a\ncentralized point of communication between the IoT devices, which can create a\nbackdoor into network data for hackers. One of the common and effective ways to\ndetect such attacks is intrusion detection in the network traffic. In this\npaper, we proposed an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect anomalies in a\nsmart home network using a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) hybrid model. The BiLSTM recurrent behavior\nprovides the intrusion detection model to preserve the learned information\nthrough time, and the CNN extracts perfectly the data features. The proposed\nmodel can be applied to any smart home network gateway.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks offer numerous potential applications across geoscience,\nfor example, one could argue that they are the state-of-the-art method for\npredicting faults in seismic datasets. In quantitative reservoir\ncharacterization workflows, it is common to incorporate the uncertainty of\npredictions thus such subsurface models should provide calibrated probabilities\nand the associated uncertainties in their predictions. It has been shown that\npopular Deep Learning-based models are often miscalibrated, and due to their\ndeterministic nature, provide no means to interpret the uncertainty of their\npredictions. We compare three different approaches to obtaining probabilistic\nmodels based on convolutional neural networks in a Bayesian formalism, namely\nDeep Ensembles, Concrete Dropout, and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian\n(SWAG). These methods are consistently applied to fault detection case studies\nwhere Deep Ensembles use independently trained models to provide fault\nprobabilities, Concrete Dropout represents an extension to the popular Dropout\ntechnique to approximate Bayesian neural networks, and finally, we apply SWAG,\na recent method that is based on the Bayesian inference equivalence of\nmini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent. We provide quantitative results in\nterms of model calibration and uncertainty representation, as well as\nqualitative results on synthetic and real seismic datasets. Our results show\nthat the approximate Bayesian methods, Concrete Dropout and SWAG, both provide\nwell-calibrated predictions and uncertainty attributes at a lower computational\ncost when compared to the baseline Deep Ensemble approach.

    "abstract": "Machine learning has achieved an important role in the automatic\nclassification of variable stars, and several classifiers have been proposed\nover the last decade. These classifiers have achieved impressive performance in\nseveral astronomical catalogues. However, some scientific articles have also\nshown that the training data therein contain multiple sources of bias. Hence,\nthe performance of those classifiers on objects not belonging to the training\ndata is uncertain, potentially resulting in the selection of incorrect models.\nBesides, it gives rise to the deployment of misleading classifiers. An example\nof the latter is the creation of open-source labelled catalogues with biased\npredictions. In this paper, we develop a method based on an informative\nmarginal likelihood to evaluate variable star classifiers. We collect\ndeterministic rules that are based on physical descriptors of RR Lyrae stars,\nand then, to mitigate the biases, we introduce those rules into the marginal\nlikelihood estimation. We perform experiments with a set of Bayesian Logistic\nRegressions, which are trained to classify RR Lyraes, and we found that our\nmethod outperforms traditional non-informative cross-validation strategies,\neven when penalized models are assessed.

    "abstract": "Satellite remote sensing is playing an increasing role in the rapid mapping\nof damage after natural disasters. In particular, synthetic aperture radar\n(SAR) can image the Earth's surface and map damage in all weather conditions,\nday and night. However, current SAR damage mapping methods struggle to separate\ndamage from other changes in the Earth's surface. In this study, we propose a\nnovel approach to damage mapping, combining deep learning with the full time\nhistory of SAR observations of an impacted region in order to detect anomalous\nvariations in the Earth's surface properties due to a natural disaster. We\nquantify Earth surface change using time series of Interferometric SAR\ncoherence, then use a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a probabilistic anomaly\ndetector on these coherence time series. The RNN is first trained on pre-event\ncoherence time series, and then forecasts a probability distribution of the\ncoherence between pre- and post-event SAR images. The difference between the\nforecast and observed co-event coherence provides a measure of the confidence\nin the identification of damage. The method allows the user to choose a damage\ndetection threshold that is customized for each location, based on the local\nbehavior of coherence through time before the event. We apply this method to\ncalculate estimates of damage for three earthquakes using multi-year time\nseries of Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions.

    "abstract": "4D seismic imaging has been widely used in CO$_2$ sequestration projects to\nmonitor the fluid flow in the volumetric subsurface region that is not sampled\nby wells. Ideally, real-time monitoring and near-future forecasting would\nprovide site operators with great insights to understand the dynamics of the\nsubsurface reservoir and assess any potential risks. However, due to obstacles\nsuch as high deployment cost, availability of acquisition equipment, exclusion\nzones around surface structures, only very sparse seismic imaging data can be\nobtained during monitoring. That leads to an unavoidable and growing knowledge\ngap over time. The operator needs to understand the fluid flow throughout the\nproject lifetime and the seismic data are only available at a limited number of\ntimes, this is insufficient for understanding the reservoir behavior. To\novercome those challenges, we have developed spatio-temporal\nneural-network-based models that can produce high-fidelity interpolated or\nextrapolated images effectively and efficiently. Specifically, our models are\nbuilt on an autoencoder, and incorporate the long short-term memory (LSTM)\nstructure with a new loss function regularized by optical flow. We validate the\nperformance of our models using real 4D post-stack seismic imaging data\nacquired at the Sleipner CO$_2$ sequestration field.

Obtaining voxel-level\nannotations for training segmentation networks is prohibitively expensive.\nTherefore we propose a weakly-supervised segmentation method based on dense\nregression activation maps (dRAM). Most advanced weakly supervised segmentation\napproaches exploit class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects generated\nfrom high-level semantic features at a coarse resolution. As a result, CAMs\nprovide coarse outlines that do not align precisely with the object\nsegmentations. Instead, we exploit dense features from a segmentation network\nto compute dense regression activation maps (dRAMs) for preserving local\ndetails. During training, dRAMs are pooled lobe-wise to regress the per-lobe\nlesion percentage. In such a way, the network achieves additional information\nregarding the lesion quantification in comparison with the classification\napproach. Furthermore, we refine dRAMs based on an attention module and dense\nconditional random field trained together with the main regression task. The\nrefined dRAMs are served as the pseudo labels for training a final segmentation\nnetwork. When evaluated on 69 CT scans, our method substantially improves the\nintersection over union from 0.335 in the CAM-based weakly supervised\nsegmentation method to 0.495.",

    "abstract": "There exist several ways of integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into\nwireless sensor networks (WSNs) for smart city applications. Among the others,\na UAV can be employed as a relay in a \"store-carry and forward\" fashion by\nuploading data from ground sensors and meters and, then, downloading it to a\ncentral unit. However, both the uploading and downloading phases can be prone\nto potential threats and attacks. As a legacy from traditional wireless\nnetworks, the jamming attack is still one of the major and serious threats to\nUAV-aided communications, especially when the jammer is mobile, too, e.g., it\nis mounted on an UAV or inside a terrestrial vehicle. In this paper, we\ninvestigate anti-jamming communications in UAV-aided WSNs operating over\ndoubly-selective channels. In such a scenario, the signals transmitted by the\nlegitimate transmitters (sensors and meters in the uploading phase or the UAV\nin the downloading phase) and the malicious mobile jammer undergo both time\ndispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion caused\nby Doppler shifts. To suppress the jamming signal, we propose a blind\nphysical-layer technique that jointly exploits amplitudes, phases, time delays,\nand Doppler shifts differences between the two superimposed signals. Such\nparameters are estimated from data through the use of algorithms exploiting the\nalmost-cyclostationarity properties of the received signal.

This two approaches worked together to improve the segmentation\naccuracy, as well as helped the model to gain robustness against adversarial\nattacks. The overall analysis of experiments indicates a novel use of\nadversarial machine learning along with robustness enhancement.",

    "title": "Self-Organized Variational Autoencoders (Self-VAE) for Learned Image  Compression",
    "abstract": "In end-to-end optimized learned image compression, it is standard practice to\nuse a convolutional variational autoencoder with generalized divisive\nnormalization (GDN) to transform images into a latent space. Recently,\nOperational Neural Networks (ONNs) that learn the best non-linearity from a set\nof alternatives, and their self-organized variants, Self-ONNs, that approximate\nany non-linearity via Taylor series have been proposed to address the\nlimitations of convolutional layers and a fixed nonlinear activation. In this\npaper, we propose to replace the convolutional and GDN layers in the\nvariational autoencoder with self-organized operational layers, and propose a\nnovel self-organized variational autoencoder (Self-VAE) architecture that\nbenefits from stronger non-linearity. The experimental results demonstrate that\nthe proposed Self-VAE yields improvements in both rate-distortion performance\nand perceptual image quality.",
