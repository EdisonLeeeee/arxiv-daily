Secondly, the\nseparation problem asks for two given languages whether they can be separated\nby a language from the fixed class. And thirdly, the covering problem is a\ngeneralization of separation problem to more than two given languages. Most\ninstances of such problems were solved by the connection of regular languages\nand finite monoids. Both the membership problem and the separation problem were\nalso extended to ordered monoids. The computation of pointlikes can be\ninterpreted as the algebraic counterpart of the covering problem. In this\npaper, we extend the computation of pointlikes to ordered monoids. This leads\nto the notion of conelikes for the corresponding algebraic framework.\nWe apply this framework to the Trotter-Weil hierarchy and both the full and\nthe half levels of the $\\text{FO}^2$ quantifier alternation hierarchy.

In this work we present DeepDebug, an\napproach to automated debugging using large, pretrained transformers. We begin\nby training a bug-creation model on reversed commit data for the purpose of\ngenerating synthetic bugs. We apply these synthetic bugs toward two ends.\nFirst, we directly train a backtranslation model on all functions from 200K\nrepositories. Next, we focus on 10K repositories for which we can execute\ntests, and create buggy versions of all functions in those repositories that\nare covered by passing tests. This provides us with rich debugging information\nsuch as stack traces and print statements, which we use to finetune our model\nwhich was pretrained on raw source code. Finally, we strengthen all our models\nby expanding the context window beyond the buggy function itself, and adding a\nskeleton consisting of that function's parent class, imports, signatures,\ndocstrings, and method bodies, in order of priority. On the QuixBugs benchmark,\nwe increase the total number of fixes found by over 50%, while also decreasing\nthe false positive rate from 35% to 5% and decreasing the timeout from six\nhours to one minute. On our own benchmark of executable tests, our model fixes\n68% of all bugs on its first attempt without using traces, and after adding\ntraces it fixes 75% on first attempt. We will open-source our framework and\nvalidation set for evaluating on executable tests.",

In contrast to the common belief that this provides privacy benefits,\nwe here add to the very recent results on privacy risks when sharing gradients.\nSpecifically, we propose Label Leakage from Gradients (LLG), a novel attack to\nextract the labels of the users' training data from their shared gradients. The\nattack exploits the direction and magnitude of gradients to determine the\npresence or absence of any label. LLG is simple yet effective, capable of\nleaking potential sensitive information represented by labels, and scales well\nto arbitrary batch sizes and multiple classes. We empirically and\nmathematically demonstrate the validity of our attack under different settings.\nMoreover, empirical results show that LLG successfully extracts labels with\nhigh accuracy at the early stages of model training. We also discuss different\ndefense mechanisms against such leakage. Our findings suggest that gradient\ncompression is a practical technique to prevent our attack.",

However, what if one cannot easily\noutfit their platform to record these demonstration signals or worse yet the\ndemonstrator does not have access to the platform at all? Is imitation learning\nfor vision based autonomous navigation even possible in such scenarios? In this\nwork, we hypothesize that the answer is yes and that recent ideas from the\nImitation from Observation (IfO) literature can be brought to bear such that a\nrobot can learn to navigate using only ego centric video collected by a\ndemonstrator, even in the presence of viewpoint mismatch. To this end, we\nintroduce a new algorithm, Visual Observation only Imitation Learning for\nAutonomous navigation (VOILA), that can successfully learn navigation policies\nfrom a single video demonstration collected from a physically different agent.\nWe evaluate VOILA in the photorealistic AirSim simulator and show that VOILA\nnot only successfully imitates the expert, but that it also learns navigation\npolicies that can generalize to novel environments. Further, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of VOILA in a real world setting by showing that it allows a\nwheeled Jackal robot to successfully imitate a human walking in an environment\nusing a video recorded using a mobile phone camera.",

    "abstract": "The past decades have witnessed the prosperity of graph mining, with a\nmultitude of sophisticated models and algorithms designed for various mining\ntasks, such as ranking, classification, clustering and anomaly detection.\nGenerally speaking, the vast majority of the existing works aim to answer the\nfollowing question, that is, given a graph, what is the best way to mine it? In\nthis paper, we introduce the graph sanitation problem, to answer an orthogonal\nquestion. That is, given a mining task and an initial graph, what is the best\nway to improve the initially provided graph? By learning a better graph as part\nof the input of the mining model, it is expected to benefit graph mining in a\nvariety of settings, ranging from denoising, imputation to defense. We\nformulate the graph sanitation problem as a bilevel optimization problem, and\nfurther instantiate it by semi-supervised node classification, together with an\neffective solver named GaSoliNe. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed method is (1) broadly applicable with respect to different\ngraph neural network models and flexible graph modification strategies, (2)\neffective in improving the node classification accuracy on both the original\nand contaminated graphs in various perturbation scenarios. In particular, it\nbrings up to 25% performance improvement over the existing robust graph neural\nnetwork methods.",

    "abstract": "The wisdom of the crowd has long become the de facto approach for eliciting\ninformation from individuals or experts in order to predict the ground truth.\nHowever, classical democratic approaches for aggregating individual\n\\emph{votes} only work when the opinion of the majority of the crowd is\nrelatively accurate. A clever recent approach, \\emph{surprisingly popular\nvoting}, elicits additional information from the individuals, namely their\n\\emph{prediction} of other individuals' votes, and provably recovers the ground\ntruth even when experts are in minority. This approach works well when the goal\nis to pick the correct option from a small list, but when the goal is to\nrecover a true ranking of the alternatives, a direct application of the\napproach requires eliciting too much information. We explore practical\ntechniques for extending the surprisingly popular algorithm to ranked voting by\npartial votes and predictions and designing robust aggregation rules.

However, when taken to\nthe extreme, methods that promote robustness can hurt the model's sensitivity\nto rare or underrepresented patterns. In this paper, we discuss this trade-off\nbetween sensitivity and robustness to natural (non-adversarial) perturbations\nby introducing two notions: contextual feature utility and contextual feature\nsensitivity. We propose Feature Contrastive Learning (FCL) that encourages a\nmodel to be more sensitive to the features that have higher contextual utility.\nEmpirical results demonstrate that models trained with FCL achieve a better\nbalance of robustness and sensitivity, leading to improved generalization in\nthe presence of noise on both vision and NLP datasets.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Social Network Analysis studies have led to an improvement and to a\ngeneralization of existing tools to networks with multiple subsystems and\nlayers of connectivity. These kind of networks are usually called multilayer\nnetworks. Multilayer networks in which each layer shares at least one node with\nsome other layer in the network are called multiplex networks. Being a\nmultiplex network does not require all nodes to exist on every layer. In this\npaper, we built a criminal multiplex network which concerns an anti-mafia\noperation called \"Montagna\" and it is based on the examination of a pre-trial\ndetention order issued on March 14, 2007 by the judge for preliminary\ninvestigations of the Court of Messina (Sicily). \"Montagna\" focus on two Mafia\nfamilies called \"Mistretta\" and \"Batanesi\" who infiltrated several economic\nactivities including the public works in the north-eastern part of Sicily,\nthrough a cartel of entrepreneurs close to the Sicilian Mafia. Originally we\nderived two single-layer networks, the former capturing meetings between\nsuspected individuals and the latter recording phone calls. But some networked\nsystems can be better modeled by multilayer structures where the individual\nnodes develop relationships in multiple layers. For this reason we built a\ntwo-layer network from the single-layer ones. These two layers share 47 nodes.\nWe followed three different approaches to measure the importance of nodes in\nmultilayer networks using degree as descriptor. Our analysis can aid in the\nidentification of key players in criminal networks.",

Based on the\nunique computational properties of model-fusion algorithms, all exchanged model\nupdates in TRUDA are disassembled at the parameter-granularity and re-stitched\nto random partitions designated for multiple TEE-protected aggregators.

The newly collected data\nusually consist of multiple modalities and characterized with multiple labels,\nthus exhibiting the co-existence of multiple types of heterogeneity. Although\nstate-of-the-art techniques are good at modeling the complex heterogeneity with\nsufficient label information, such label information can be quite expensive to\nobtain in real applications, leading to sub-optimal performance using these\ntechniques. Inspired by the capability of contrastive learning to utilize rich\nunlabeled data for improving performance, in this paper, we propose a unified\nheterogeneous learning framework, which combines both weighted unsupervised\ncontrastive loss and weighted supervised contrastive loss to model multiple\ntypes of heterogeneity. We also provide theoretical analyses showing that the\nproposed weighted supervised contrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual\ninformation of two samples from the same class and the weighted unsupervised\ncontrastive loss is the lower bound of the mutual information between the\nhidden representation of two views of the same sample.

A recent trend of research in artificial intelligence, called solution\ndiversity, has focused on the development of notions of optimality that may be\nmore appropriate in settings where subjectivity is essential. The idea is that\ninstead of aiming at the development of algorithms that output a single optimal\nsolution, the goal is to investigate algorithms that output a small set of\nsufficiently good solutions that are sufficiently diverse from one another. In\nthis way, the user has the opportunity to choose the solution that is most\nappropriate to the context at hand.

In this work, we investigate the\nimpact of this combination in the field of Kemeny Rank Aggregation, a\nwell-studied class of problems lying in the intersection of order theory and\nsocial choice theory and also in the field of order theory itself. In\nparticular, we show that the Kemeny Rank Aggregation problem is fixed-parameter\ntractable with respect to natural parameters providing natural formalizations\nof the notions of diversity and of the notion of a sufficiently good solution.\nOur main results work both when considering the traditional setting of\naggregation over linearly ordered votes, and in the more general setting where\nvotes are partially ordered.",

The\nscheme is energy stable and positivity-preserving. In this paper, the detailed\nconvergence analysis and error estimate are performed for the operator\nsplitting scheme. The nonlinearity in the reaction trajectory equation, as well\nas the implicit treatment of nonlinear and singular logarithmic terms, impose\nchallenges in numerical analysis. To overcome these difficulties, we make use\nof the convex nature of the logarithmic nonlinear terms, which are treated\nimplicitly in the chemical reaction stage. In addition, a combination of a\nrough error estimate and a refined error estimate leads to a desired bound of\nthe numerical error in the reaction stage, in the discrete maximum norm.\nFurthermore, a discrete maximum principle yields the evolution bound of the\nnumerical error function at the diffusion stage.

However, providing fine-grained, accurate, time-efficient, and\nadaptive traffic speed prediction for a growing transportation network where\nthe size of the network keeps increasing and new traffic detectors are\nconstantly deployed has not been well studied. To address this issue, this\npaper presents DistTune based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the\nNelder-Mead method. Whenever encountering an unprocessed detector, DistTune\ndecides if it should customize an LSTM model for this detector by comparing the\ndetector with other processed detectors in terms of the normalized traffic\nspeed patterns they have observed. If similarity is found, DistTune directly\nshares an existing LSTM model with this detector to achieve time-efficient\nprocessing. Otherwise, DistTune customizes an LSTM model for the detector to\nachieve fine-grained prediction. To make DistTune even more time-efficient,\nDistTune performs on a cluster of computing nodes in parallel. To achieve\nadaptive traffic speed prediction, DistTune also provides LSTM re-customization\nfor detectors that suffer from unsatisfactory prediction accuracy due to for\ninstance traffic speed pattern change. Extensive experiments based on traffic\ndata collected from freeway I5-N in California are conducted to evaluate the\nperformance of DistTune.

    "abstract": "In 2019, The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) launched an\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) Health Outcomes Challenge seeking solutions to\npredict risk in value-based care for incorporation into CMS Innovation Center\npayment and service delivery models. Recently, modern language models have\nplayed key roles in a number of health related tasks. This paper presents, to\nthe best of our knowledge, the first application of these models to patient\nreadmission prediction. To facilitate this, we create a dataset of 1.2 million\nmedical history samples derived from the Limited Dataset (LDS) issued by CMS.\nMoreover, we propose a comprehensive modeling solution centered on a deep\nlearning framework for this data. To demonstrate the framework, we train an\nattention-based Transformer to learn Medicare semantics in support of\nperforming downstream prediction tasks thereby achieving 0.91 AUC and 0.91\nrecall on readmission classification. We also introduce a novel data\npre-processing pipeline and discuss pertinent deployment considerations\nsurrounding model explainability and bias.",

This allows us to state the problem of semantic heterogeneity as a\nproblem of Representation Diversity where the different types of heterogeneity,\nviz. Conceptual, Language, Knowledge, and Data, are uniformly dealt within each\nsingle layer, independently from the others. In this paper we describe the\nproposed stratified representation of data and the process by which data are\nfirst transformed into the target representation, then suitably integrated and\nthen, finally, presented to the user in her preferred format.

Here, we\nare given an assignment problem on some of the subgraphs of a given graph, and\nwe are looking for a heaviest assignment which is feasible when restricted to\nany of the assignment problems. More precisely, we are given a graph with a\nweight- and a capacity function on its edges and a set of its subgraphs\n$H_1,\\dots,H_k$ along with a degree upper bound function for each of them. In\naddition, we are also given a laminar system on the node set with an upper\nbound on the degree-sum of the nodes in each set in the system. We want to\nassign each edge a non-negative integer below its capacity such that the total\nweight is maximized, the degrees in each subgraph are below the degree upper\nbound associated with the subgraph, and the degree-sum bound is respected in\neach set of the laminar system.\nThe problem is shown to be APX-hard in the unweighted case even if the graph\nis a forest and $k=2$. This also implies that the Distance matching problem is\nAPX-hard in the weighted case and that the Cyclic distance matching problem is\nAPX-hard in the unweighted case. We identify multiple special cases when the\nproblem can be solved in strongly polynomial time. One of these cases, the\nso-called locally laminar case, is a common generalization of the Hierarchical\nb-matching problem and the Laminar matchoid problem, and it implies that both\nof these problems can be solved efficiently in the weighted, capacitated case\n-- improving upon the most general polynomial-time algorithms for these\nproblems. The problem can be constant approximated when $k$ is a constant, and\nwe show that the approximation factor matches the integrality gap of a\nstrengthened LP-relaxation for small $k$. We give improved approximation\nalgorithms for special cases, for example, when the degree bounds are uniform\nor the graph is sparse.",

    "abstract": "Object goal navigation aims to steer an agent towards a target object based\non observations of the agent. It is of pivotal importance to design effective\nvisual representations of the observed scene in determining navigation actions.\nIn this paper, we introduce a Visual Transformer Network (VTNet) for learning\ninformative visual representation in navigation. VTNet is a highly effective\nstructure that embodies two key properties for visual representations: First,\nthe relationships among all the object instances in a scene are exploited;\nSecond, the spatial locations of objects and image regions are emphasized so\nthat directional navigation signals can be learned. Furthermore, we also\ndevelop a pre-training scheme to associate the visual representations with\nnavigation signals, and thus facilitate navigation policy learning. In a\nnutshell, VTNet embeds object and region features with their location cues as\nspatial-aware descriptors and then incorporates all the encoded descriptors\nthrough attention operations to achieve informative representation for\nnavigation. Given such visual representations, agents are able to explore the\ncorrelations between visual observations and navigation actions. For example,\nan agent would prioritize \"turning right\" over \"turning left\" when the visual\nrepresentation emphasizes on the right side of activation map. Experiments in\nthe artificial environment AI2-Thor demonstrate that VTNet significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in unseen testing environments.",

    "abstract": "Superpixels are higher-order perceptual groups of pixels in an image, often\ncarrying much more information than raw pixels. There is an inherent relational\nstructure to the relationship among different superpixels of an image. This\nrelational information can convey some form of domain information about the\nimage, e.g. relationship between superpixels representing two eyes in a cat\nimage. Our interest in this paper is to construct computer vision models,\nspecifically those based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to incorporate these\nsuperpixels information. We propose a methodology to construct a hybrid model\nthat leverages (a) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to deal with spatial\ninformation in an image, and (b) Graph Neural Network (GNN) to deal with\nrelational superpixel information in the image. The proposed deep model is\nlearned using a generic hybrid loss function that we call a `hybrid' loss. We\nevaluate the predictive performance of our proposed hybrid vision model on four\npopular image classification datasets: MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.\nMoreover, we evaluate our method on three real-world classification tasks:\nCOVID-19 X-Ray Detection, LFW Face Recognition, and SOCOFing Fingerprint\nIdentification. The results demonstrate that the relational superpixel\ninformation provided via a GNN could improve the performance of standard\nCNN-based vision systems.",

    "abstract": "Camouflaged objects attempt to conceal their texture into the background and\ndiscriminating them from the background is hard even for human beings. The main\nobjective of this paper is to explore the camouflaged object segmentation\nproblem, namely, segmenting the camouflaged object(s) for a given image. This\nproblem has not been well studied in spite of a wide range of potential\napplications including the preservation of wild animals and the discovery of\nnew species, surveillance systems, search-and-rescue missions in the event of\nnatural disasters such as earthquakes, floods or hurricanes. This paper\naddresses a new challenging problem of camouflaged object segmentation. To\naddress this problem, we provide a new image dataset of camouflaged objects for\nbenchmarking purposes. In addition, we propose a general end-to-end network,\ncalled the Anabranch Network, that leverages both classification and\nsegmentation tasks. Different from existing networks for segmentation, our\nproposed network possesses the second branch for classification to predict the\nprobability of containing camouflaged object(s) in an image, which is then\nfused into the main branch for segmentation to boost up the segmentation\naccuracy. Extensive experiments conducted on the newly built dataset\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our network using various fully convolutional\nnetworks. \\url{https://sites.google.com/view/ltnghia/research/camo}",

    "abstract": "Non-stationary environments are challenging for reinforcement learning\nalgorithms. If the state transition and/or reward functions change based on\nlatent factors, the agent is effectively tasked with optimizing a behavior that\nmaximizes performance over a possibly infinite random sequence of Markov\nDecision Processes (MDPs), each of which drawn from some unknown distribution.\nWe call each such MDP a context. Most related works make strong assumptions\nsuch as knowledge about the distribution over contexts, the existence of\npre-training phases, or a priori knowledge about the number, sequence, or\nboundaries between contexts. We introduce an algorithm that efficiently learns\npolicies in non-stationary environments. It analyzes a possibly infinite stream\nof data and computes, in real-time, high-confidence change-point detection\nstatistics that reflect whether novel, specialized policies need to be created\nand deployed to tackle novel contexts, or whether previously-optimized ones\nmight be reused. We show that (i) this algorithm minimizes the delay until\nunforeseen changes to a context are detected, thereby allowing for rapid\nresponses; and (ii) it bounds the rate of false alarm, which is important in\norder to minimize regret. Our method constructs a mixture model composed of a\n(possibly infinite) ensemble of probabilistic dynamics predictors that model\nthe different modes of the distribution over underlying latent MDPs. We\nevaluate our algorithm on high-dimensional continuous reinforcement learning\nproblems and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art (model-free and\nmodel-based) RL algorithms, as well as state-of-the-art meta-learning methods\nspecially designed to deal with non-stationarity.",

    "title": "Mobile Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for NOMA Networks: Federated  Learning Approaches",
    "abstract": "A novel framework of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-enhanced\nindoor wireless networks is proposed, where an RIS mounted on the robot is\ninvoked to enable mobility of the RIS and enhance the service quality for\nmobile users. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques are\nadopted to further increase the spectrum efficiency since RISs are capable to\nprovide NOMA with artificial controlled channel conditions, which can be seen\nas a beneficial operation condition to obtain NOMA gains. To optimize the sum\nrate of all users, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is\ninvoked to optimize the deployment and phase shifts of the mobile RIS as well\nas the power allocation policy. In order to improve the efficiency and\neffectiveness of agent training for the DDPG agents, a federated learning (FL)\nconcept is adopted to enable multiple agents to simultaneously explore similar\nenvironments and exchange experiences. We also proved that with the same random\nexploring policy, the FL armed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents can\ntheoretically obtain a reward gain compare to the independent agents. Our\nsimulation results indicate that the mobile RIS scheme can significantly\noutperform the fixed RIS paradigm, which provides about three times data rate\ngain compare to the fixed RIS paradigm. Moreover, the NOMA scheme is capable to\nachieve a gain of 42% in contrast with the OMA scheme in terms of sum rate.\nFinally, the multi-cell simulation proved that the FL enhanced DDPG algorithm\nhas a superior convergence rate and optimization performance than the\nindependent training framework.",

    "abstract": "Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising paradigm to respond to the rising\ncomputation requests of the users in the emerging wireless networks, and\nespecially in the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we study\nbuffer-aided relay-assisted MEC in systems with discrete transmission time-line\nand block fading channels. We consider a hierarchical network composed of a\nsource, a buffer-aided relay, and another node in a higher level in the\nhierarchy. The source sends its tasks to the relay which in turn randomly\nassigns the received tasks to its own computing server or to the server of the\nnext node in the hierarchy. We provide a framework to take into account the\ndelays in both the transmission and computation buffers which facilitates the\nderivation of the expression for the Average Response Time (ART) in the system.\nBased on that and the system average power consumption in each slot, we\nintroduce the concept of Average Response Energy (ARE) as a novel metric to\ncapture the energy efficiency in MEC. Accordingly, we propose two offloading\nschemes with relevant problem formulations, namely the Minimum ART (MART) and\nthe Minimum ARE (MARE) schemes, to optimize the ART or the ARE while keeping\nthe system queues stable. We analyze the properties of the formulated problems,\nin terms of the feasible sets and the objective functions and noting them, we\npropose effective solution methods.

    "abstract": "Recently, plenty of work has tried to introduce transformers into computer\nvision tasks, with good results. Unlike classic convolution networks, which\nextract features within a local receptive field, transformers can adaptively\naggregate similar features from a global view using self-attention mechanism.\nFor object detection, Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) proposes feature\ninteraction across layers and proves its extremely importance. However, its\ninteraction is still in a local manner, which leaves a lot of room for\nimprovement. Since transformer was originally designed for NLP tasks, adapting\nprocessing subject directly from text to image will cause unaffordable\ncomputation and space overhead. In this paper, we utilize a linearized\nattention function to overcome above problems and build a novel architecture,\nnamed Content-Augmented Feature Pyramid Network (CA-FPN), which proposes a\nglobal content extraction module and deeply combines with FPN through light\nlinear transformers. What's more, light transformers can further make the\napplication of multi-head attention mechanism easier. Most importantly, our\nCA-FPN can be readily plugged into existing FPN-based models. Extensive\nexperiments on the challenging COCO object detection dataset demonstrated that\nour CA-FPN significantly outperforms competitive baselines without bells and\nwhistles.

    "abstract": "Knowing the uncertainty in a prediction is critical when making expensive\ninvestment decisions and when patient safety is paramount, but machine learning\n(ML) models in drug discovery typically provide only a single best estimate and\nignore all sources of uncertainty. Predictions from these models may therefore\nbe over-confident, which can put patients at risk and waste resources when\ncompounds that are destined to fail are further developed. Probabilistic\npredictive models (PPMs) can incorporate uncertainty in both the data and\nmodel, and return a distribution of predicted values that represents the\nuncertainty in the prediction. PPMs not only let users know when predictions\nare uncertain, but the intuitive output from these models makes communicating\nrisk easier and decision making better. Many popular machine learning methods\nhave a PPM or Bayesian analogue, making PPMs easy to fit into current\nworkflows. We use toxicity prediction as a running example, but the same\nprinciples apply for all prediction models used in drug discovery. The\nconsequences of ignoring uncertainty and how PPMs account for uncertainty are\nalso described. We aim to make the discussion accessible to a broad\nnon-mathematical audience.

Local random walk is considered to\nbe one of the most well-known algorithms in the category of quasi-local\nmethods. It traverses the network using the traditional random walk with a\nlimited number of steps, randomly selecting one adjacent node in each step\namong the nodes which have equal importance.

However, in most datasets, this method is not able to perform accurately\nin scoring remarkably similar nodes. In the present article, an efficient\nmethod is proposed for improving local random walk by encouraging random walk\nto move, in every step, towards the node which has a stronger influence.\nTherefore, the next node is selected according to the influence of the source\nnode. To do so, using mutual information, the concept of the asymmetric mutual\ninfluence of nodes is presented.

Use of personal identification numbers (PIN)\nas a single authentication method for IB users is prone to insecurities such as\nphishing, hacking and shoulder surfing.

At the second level, user is\nauthenticated by means of face recognition (FR) should they initiate a\ntransaction classified as sensitive.

The framework is\ndemonstrated and validated by successfully calibrating the model parameters of\na piston problem and identifying damage field of an airfoil under transonic\nbuffeting.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose three pilot assignment schemes to reduce the effect\nof pilot contamination in cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output\n(MIMO) systems. Our first algorithm, which is based on the idea of random\nsequential adsorption (RSA) process from the statistical physics literature,\ncan be implemented in a distributed and scalable manner while ensuring a\nminimum distance among the co-pilot users. Further, leveraging the rich\nliterature of the RSA process, we present an approximate analytical approach to\naccurately determine the density of the co-pilot users as well as the pilot\nassignment probability for the typical user in this network. We also develop\ntwo optimization-based centralized pilot allocation schemes with the primary\ngoal of benchmarking the RSA-based scheme. The first centralized scheme is\nbased only on the user locations (just like the RSA-based scheme) and\npartitions the users into sets of co-pilot users such that the minimum distance\nbetween two users in a partition is maximized. The second centralized scheme\ntakes both user and remote radio head (RRH) locations into account and provides\na near-optimal solution in terms of sum-user spectral efficiency (SE). The\ngeneral idea is to first cluster the users with similar propagation conditions\nwith respect to the RRHs using spectral graph theory and then ensure that the\nusers in each cluster are assigned different pilots using the branch and price\n(BnP) algorithm. Our simulation results demonstrate that despite admitting\ndistributed implementation, the RSA-based scheme has a competitive performance\nwith respect to the first centralized scheme in all regimes as well as to the\nnear-optimal second scheme when the density of RRHs is high.",

Our work\nis derived comprehensively and complementarily via a three-step process, where\nboth the natural forking probability and its decay rate are presented. Through\nsolid theoretical derivation and extensive numerical simulations, we find 1)\nthe probability of the mismatch between block generation and dissemination\nexceeding a given threshold dwindles exponentially with the increase of natural\nforking robustness related parameter or the difference between the block\ndissemination rate and block creation rate; 2) the natural forking robustness\nrelated parameter may emphasize a more dominant effect on accelerating the\nabortion of natural forking in some cases; 3) when the self-correlated block\ngeneration rate is depicted as the stationary autoregressive process with a\nscaling parameter, it is found that setting a lower scaling parameter may speed\nup the failure of natural forking.

    "abstract": "Registration networks have shown great application potentials in medical\nimage analysis. However, supervised training methods have a great demand for\nlarge and high-quality labeled datasets, which is time-consuming and sometimes\nimpractical due to data sharing issues. Unsupervised image registration\nalgorithms commonly employ intensity-based similarity measures as loss\nfunctions without any manual annotations. These methods estimate the\nparameterized transformations between pairs of moving and fixed images through\nthe optimization of the network parameters during training. However, these\nmethods become less effective when the image quality varies, e.g., some images\nare corrupted by substantial noise or artifacts. In this work, we propose a\nnovel approach based on a low-rank representation, i.e., Regnet-LRR, to tackle\nthe problem. We project noisy images into a noise-free low-rank space, and then\ncompute the similarity between the images. Based on the low-rank similarity\nmeasure, we train the registration network to predict the dense deformation\nfields of noisy image pairs. We highlight that the low-rank projection is\nreformulated in a way that the registration network can successfully update\ngradients. With two tasks, i.e., cardiac and abdominal intra-modality\nregistration, we demonstrate that the low-rank representation can boost the\ngeneralization ability and robustness of models as well as bring significant\nimprovements in noisy data registration scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Emerging wireless control applications demand for extremely high closed-loop\nreliability under strict latency constraints, which the conventional Automatic\nRepeat reQuest (ARQ) solutions with static schedules fail to provide. To\novercome this issue and enable data-link layer error control for ultra reliable\nlow-latency communication (URLLC) services, we propose a novel protocol: the\nClosed-Loop ARQ (CLARQ), which forces to accomplish an information exchange\nround within a fixed loop-back latency, and dynamically re-allocates the\nremaining resource between uplink and downlink slots upon the result of last\nuplink transmission. The proposed method guarantees to meet the latency\nrequirement, while delivering high communication reliability and power\nefficiency. It can be efficiently offline optimized by means of dynamic\nprogramming techniques, and is capable of real-time deployment with a low-cost\nimplementation based on look-up tables. Numerical evaluations have verified\nthat CLARQ outperforms baselines with significantly improved closed-loop\nreliability and reduced energy consumption. Especially, over a Rayleigh channel\nwith 0dB mean SNR, it is able to provide a closed-loop error rate below 1e-7\nwithin 10ms loop-back latency, which makes our proposal competitive for\npractical URLLC applications in future 5G-and-beyond networks.",

    "abstract": "With their increasing penetration in power systems, distributed energy\nresources (DERs) have great potential to enhance their profits by participating\nin the electricity market via aggregation. Because most DERs are integrated\ninto distribution systems, the strategic bidding behavior of a DER aggregator\nwill have a significant impact on the operation of the distribution system. In\nthis paper, a single-leader-multi-follower bi-level optimization model is\nproposed to investigate the strategic bidding behavior of the price-maker DER\naggregator in day-ahead joint energy and reserve markets. The mixed-integer\noptimization problems for the security check of the distribution system are\nintroduced as lower-level problems for the security check of the DERs'\nscheduling scheme under three different scenarios. The proposed complex\nbi-level problem is then transformed into a bi-level mixed-integer linear\nprogramming model and solved. First, a novel linearized power flow model for\nthe distribution system considering the substation transformer tap is developed\nto simplify the security check problem. Then, the proposed bi-level model is\nglobally solved using a proposed tailored optimization algorithm that\nintegrates the traditional Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based reformulation approach and\na relaxation-based bi-level reformulation and decomposition algorithm. Finally,\ncase studies are carried out on a constructed integrated transmission and\ndistribution (T&D) system and a practical integrated T&D system.

Parameterized\ngraph edge modification problems received considerable attention in the last\ndecades.\nIn this paper we focus on finding small kernels for edge modification\nproblems. One of the most studied problems is the \\textsc{Cluster Editing}\nproblem, in which the goal is to partition the vertex set into a disjoint union\nof cliques. Even if a $2k$ kernel exists for \\textsc{Cluster Editing}, this\nkernel does not reduce the size of the instance in most cases. Therefore, we\nexplore the question of whether linear kernels are a theoretical limit in edge\nmodification problems, in particular when the target graphs are very structured\n(such as a partition into cliques for instance). We prove, as far as we know,\nthe first sublinear kernel for an edge modification problem. Namely, we show\nthat \\textsc{Clique + Independent Set Deletion}, which is a restriction of\n\\textsc{Cluster Deletion}, admits a kernel of size $O(k/\\log k)$.\nWe also obtain small kernels for several other edge modification problems.

From the view\nof individual cognition, we select the top-$k$ articles with high degree of\ndifference and interact with the claim to explore the local key evidence\nfragments. To weaken the bias of individual cognition-view evidence, we devise\ninconsistent loss to suppress the divergence between global and local evidence\nfor strengthening the consistent shared evidence between the both.

That is to say, QNNs cannot differentiate a\nquantum binary signal and its negational counterpart in a binary classification\ntask. We further empirically evaluate the negational symmetry of QNNs in binary\npattern classification tasks using Google's quantum computing framework. The\ntheoretical and experimental results suggest that negational symmetry is a\nfundamental property of QNNs, which is not shared by classical models. Our\nfindings also imply that negational symmetry is a double-edged sword in\npractical quantum applications.",

    "abstract": "Indoor positioning is currently recognized as one of the important features\nin emergency, commercial and industrial applications. The 5G network enhances\nmobility, flexibility, reliability, and security to new higher levels which\ngreatly benefit the IoT and industrial applications. Industrial IoT (IIoT)\nuse-cases are characterized by ambitious system requirements for positioning\naccuracy in many verticals. For example, on the factory floor, it is important\nto locate assets and moving objects such as forklifts. The deployment design\nfor different IIoT environments has a significant impact on the positioning\nper-performance in terms of both accuracy and availability of the service.\nIndoor factory (InF) and indoor open office (IOO) are two available and\nstandardized Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) scenarios for\nevaluation of indoor channel models and positioning performance in IIoT use\ncases. This paper aims to evaluate the positioning performance in terms of\naccuracy and availability while considering different deployment strategies.\nOur simulation-based evaluation shows that deployment plays a vital role when\nit comes to achieving high accuracy positioning performance. It is for example\nfavorable to deploy the 5G Transmission and Reception Points (TRPs) on the\nwalls of the factory halls than deploying them attached to the ceiling.",

    "abstract": "Due to the importance of the lower bounding distances and the attractiveness\nof symbolic representations, the family of symbolic aggregate approximations\n(SAX) has been used extensively for encoding time series data. However, typical\nSAX-based methods rely on two restrictive assumptions; the Gaussian\ndistribution and equiprobable symbols. This paper proposes two novel\ndata-driven SAX-based symbolic representations, distinguished by their\ndiscretization steps. The first representation, oriented for general data\ncompaction and indexing scenarios, is based on the combination of kernel\ndensity estimation and Lloyd-Max quantization to minimize the information loss\nand mean squared error in the discretization step. The second method, oriented\nfor high-level mining tasks, employs the Mean-Shift clustering method and is\nshown to enhance anomaly detection in the lower-dimensional space. Besides, we\nverify on a theoretical basis a previously observed phenomenon of the intrinsic\nprocess that results in a lower than the expected variance of the intermediate\npiecewise aggregate approximation. This phenomenon causes an additional\ninformation loss but can be avoided with a simple modification. The proposed\nrepresentations possess all the attractive properties of the conventional SAX\nmethod. Furthermore, experimental evaluation on real-world datasets\ndemonstrates their superiority compared to the traditional SAX and an\nalternative data-driven SAX variant.",

Additionally, there exists no benchmark dataset to\ngeneralize this task on videos of varying lengths.

    "abstract": "Learning from implicit feedback is one of the most common cases in the\napplication of recommender systems. Generally speaking, interacted examples are\nconsidered as positive while negative examples are sampled from uninteracted\nones. However, noisy examples are prevalent in real-world implicit feedback. A\nnoisy positive example could be interacted but it actually leads to negative\nuser preference. A noisy negative example which is uninteracted because of\nunawareness of the user could also denote potential positive user preference.\nConventional training methods overlook these noisy examples, leading to\nsub-optimal recommendation. In this work, we propose probabilistic and\nvariational recommendation denoising for implicit feedback. Through an\nempirical study, we find that different models make relatively similar\npredictions on clean examples which denote the real user preference, while the\npredictions on noisy examples vary much more across different models. Motivated\nby this observation, we propose denoising with probabilistic inference (DPI)\nwhich aims to minimize the KL-divergence between the real user preference\ndistributions parameterized by two recommendation models while maximize the\nlikelihood of data observation. We then show that DPI recovers the evidence\nlower bound of an variational auto-encoder when the real user preference is\nconsidered as the latent variables. This leads to our second learning framework\ndenoising with variational autoencoder (DVAE). We employ the proposed DPI and\nDVAE on four state-of-the-art recommendation models and conduct experiments on\nthree datasets.

To this end, we extend to multiphase the Cahn-Hilliard model with\ndoubly degenerate mobilities we introduced in [17] and we show that this\nextension still preserves the second order of approximation of the sharp limit.\nIn a second part, we propose a simple and efficient numerical schemes that\nrequire only about 60 lines in Matlab.

    "abstract": "Although the combination of the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)\nmodulation and the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology can\nmake communication systems perform better in high-mobility scenarios, there are\nstill many challenges in downlink channel estimation owing to inaccurate\nmodeling and high pilot overhead in practical systems. In this paper, we\npropose a channel state information (CSI) acquisition scheme for downlink\nmassive MIMO-OTFS in presence of the fractional Doppler, including\ndeterministic pilot design and channel estimation algorithm. First, we analyze\nthe input-output relationship of the single-input single-output (SISO) OTFS\nbased on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modem and extend\nit to massive MIMO-OTFS. Moreover, we formulate an accurate model for the\npractical system in which the fractional Doppler is considered and the\ninfluence of subpaths is revealed. A deterministic pilot design is then\nproposed based on the model and the structure of the pilot matrix to reduce\npilot overhead and save memory consumption. Since channel geometry changes very\nslowly relative to the communication timescale, we put forward a modified\nsensing matrix based channel estimation (MSMCE) algorithm to acquire the\ndownlink CSI. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed downlink CSI\nacquisition scheme has significant advantages over traditional algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Tensor decomposition is a popular technique for tensor completion, However\nmost of the existing methods are based on linear or shallow model, when the\ndata tensor becomes large and the observation data is very small, it is prone\nto over fitting and the performance decreases significantly. To address this\nproblem, the completion method for a tensor based on a Biased Deep Tensor\nFactorization Network (BDTFN) is proposed. This method can not only overcome\nthe shortcomings of traditional tensor factorization, but also deal with\ncomplex non-linear data. Firstly, the horizontal and lateral tensors\ncorresponding to the observed values of the input tensors are used as inputs\nand projected to obtain their horizontal (lateral) potential feature tensors.\nSecondly, the horizontal (lateral) potential feature tensors are respectively\nconstructed into a multilayer perceptron network. Finally, the horizontal and\nlateral output tensors are fused by constructing a bilinear pooling layer.\nTensor forward-propagation is composed of those three step, and its parameters\nare updated by tensor back-propagation using the multivariable chain rule. In\nthis paper, we consider the large-scale 5-minute traffic speed data set and use\nit to address the missing data imputation problem for large-scale\nspatiotemporal traffic data. In addition, we compare the numerical performance\nof the proposed algorithm with those for state-of-the-art approaches on video\nrecovery and color image recovery. Numerical experimental results illustrate\nthat our approach is not only much more accurate than those state-of-the-art\nmethods, but it also has high speed.",

    "abstract": "Code search is a common practice for developers during software\nimplementation. The challenges of accurate code search mainly lie in the\nknowledge gap between source code and natural language (i.e., queries). Due to\nthe limited code-query pairs and large code-description pairs available, the\nprior studies based on deep learning techniques focus on learning the semantic\nmatching relation between source code and corresponding description texts for\nthe task, and hypothesize that the semantic gap between descriptions and user\nqueries is marginal. In this work, we found that the code search models trained\non code-description pairs may not perform well on user queries, which indicates\nthe semantic distance between queries and code descriptions. To mitigate the\nsemantic distance for more effective code search, we propose QueCos, a\nQuery-enriched Code search model. QueCos learns to generate semantic enriched\nqueries to capture the key semantics of given queries with reinforcement\nlearning (RL). With RL, the code search performance is considered as a reward\nfor producing accurate semantic enriched queries. The enriched queries are\nfinally employed for code search. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show\nthat QueCos can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art code search\nmodels.",

However,\nmany technologies such as Deep Learning and tools like Word Embeddings have\nstarted to be investigated only recently, and many challenges remain open when\nit comes to healthcare domain applications. To address these challenges, we\npropose the use of Deep Learning and Word Embeddings for identifying sixteen\nmorbidity types within textual descriptions of clinical records. For this\npurpose, we have used a Deep Learning model based on Bidirectional Long-Short\nTerm Memory (LSTM) layers which can exploit state-of-the-art vector\nrepresentations of data such as Word Embeddings. We have employed pre-trained\nWord Embeddings namely GloVe and Word2Vec, and our own Word Embeddings trained\non the target domain. Furthermore, we have compared the performances of the\ndeep learning approaches against the traditional tf-idf using Support Vector\nMachine and Multilayer perceptron (our baselines). From the obtained results it\nseems that the latter outperforms the combination of Deep Learning approaches\nusing any word embeddings.

    "abstract": "Simulation speed depends on code structures, hence it is crucial how to build\na fast algorithm. We solve the Allen-Cahn equation by an explicit finite\ndifference method, so it requires grid calculations implemented by many\nfor-loops in the simulation code. In terms of programming, many for-loops make\nthe simulation speed slow. To solve the problem, we propose a model\narchitecture containing a pad and a convolution operation for the Allen-Cahn\nequation. Also, the GPU operation is used to boost up the speed more. In this\nway, the simulation of other differential equations can be improved. In this\npaper, various numerical simulations are conducted to confirm that the\nAllen-Cahn equation follows motion by mean curvature and phase separation in\ntwo-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces. Finally, we demonstrate that our\nalgorithm is much faster than an unoptimized code and the CPU operation.",

WCL bias can alter the assessment of entities reported in the news,\ne.g., \"freedom fighters\" vs. \"terrorists.\" At the core of the analysis is a\nneural model that uses a news-adapted BERT language model to determine\ntarget-dependent sentiment, a high-level effect of WCL bias.

    "abstract": "The innovative services empowered by the Internet of Things (IoT) require a\nseamless and reliable wireless infrastructure that enables communications\nwithin heterogeneous and dynamic low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). The\nRouting Protocol for LLNs (RPL) was designed to meet the communication\nrequirements of a wide range of IoT application domains. However, a load\nbalancing problem exists in RPL under heavy traffic-load scenarios, degrading\nthe network performance in terms of delay and packet delivery. In this paper,\nwe tackle the problem of load-balancing in RPL networks using a\nreinforcement-learning framework. The proposed method adopts Q-learning at each\nnode to learn an optimal parent selection policy based on the dynamic network\nconditions. Each node maintains the routing information of its neighbours as\nQ-values that represent a composite routing cost as a function of the\ncongestion level, the link-quality and the hop-distance. The Q-values are\nupdated continuously exploiting the existing RPL signalling mechanism. The\nperformance of the proposed approach is evaluated through extensive simulations\nand compared with the existing work to demonstrate its effectiveness. The\nresults show that the proposed method substantially improves network\nperformance in terms of packet delivery and average delay with a marginal\nincrease in the signalling frequency.",

As these APIs get deployed for high-stakes applications, it's very\nimportant that they are robust to different manipulations. Recent works have\nonly focused on typical adversarial attacks when evaluating the robustness of\nvision APIs. We propose two new aspects of adversarial image generation methods\nand evaluate them on the robustness of Google Cloud Vision API's optical\ncharacter recognition service and object detection APIs deployed in real-world\nsettings such as sightengine.com, picpurify.com, Google Cloud Vision API, and\nMicrosoft Azure's Computer Vision API.

These\nmethods are so straightforward that even non-specialists can craft such\nattacks. As a result, they pose a serious threat where APIs are used for\nhigh-stakes applications. Our transparent adversarial examples successfully\nevade state-of-the art object detections APIs such as Azure Cloud Vision\n(attack success rate 52%) and Google Cloud Vision (attack success rate 36%).\n90% of the images have a secret embedded text that successfully fools the\nvision of time-limited humans but is detected by Google Cloud Vision API's\noptical character recognition.

    "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enable the traditional recommender\nsystems to explicitly acquire user preferences towards items and attributes\nthrough interactive conversations. Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely\nadopted to learn conversational recommendation policies to decide what\nattributes to ask, which items to recommend, and when to ask or recommend, at\neach conversation turn. However, existing methods mainly target at solving one\nor two of these three decision-making problems in CRS with separated\nconversation and recommendation components, which restrict the scalability and\ngenerality of CRS and fall short of preserving a stable training procedure. In\nthe light of these challenges, we propose to formulate these three\ndecision-making problems in CRS as a unified policy learning task. In order to\nsystematically integrate conversation and recommendation components, we develop\na dynamic weighted graph based RL method to learn a policy to select the action\nat each conversation turn, either asking an attribute or recommending items.\nFurther, to deal with the sample efficiency issue, we propose two action\nselection strategies for reducing the candidate action space according to the\npreference and entropy information. Experimental results on two benchmark CRS\ndatasets and a real-world E-Commerce application show that the proposed method\nnot only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also enhances\nthe scalability and stability of CRS.",

    "abstract": "Joint relation modeling is a curial component in human motion prediction.\nMost existing methods tend to design skeletal-based graphs to build the\nrelations among joints, where local interactions between joint pairs are well\nlearned. However, the global coordination of all joints, which reflects human\nmotion's balance property, is usually weakened because it is learned from part\nto whole progressively and asynchronously. Thus, the final predicted motions\nare sometimes unnatural. To tackle this issue, we learn a medium, called\nbalance attractor (BA), from the spatiotemporal features of motion to\ncharacterize the global motion features, which is subsequently used to build\nnew joint relations. Through the BA, all joints are related synchronously, and\nthus the global coordination of all joints can be better learned. Based on the\nBA, we propose our framework, referred to Attractor-Guided Neural Network,\nmainly including Attractor-Based Joint Relation Extractor (AJRE) and\nMulti-timescale Dynamics Extractor (MTDE). The AJRE mainly includes Global\nCoordination Extractor (GCE) and Local Interaction Extractor (LIE). The former\npresents the global coordination of all joints, and the latter encodes local\ninteractions between joint pairs. The MTDE is designed to extract dynamic\ninformation from raw position information for effective prediction. Extensive\nexperiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in both short and long-term predictions in H3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW.",

However, it is implicit\nand intractable which has never been quantitatively described due to the\ndifficulty in defending temporal features correlated to spatial image\ncomplexity. To fill this vacancy, we propose a novel bio-robotic approach to\nprofile visual dynamic complexity which can be used as a new metric. Here we\napply a state-of-the-art brain-inspired motion detection neural network model\nto explicitly profile such complexity associated with spatial-temporal\nfrequency (SF-TF) of visual scene. This model is for the first time implemented\nin an autonomous micro-mobile robot which navigates freely in an arena with\nvisual walls displaying moving sine-wave grating or cluttered natural scene.\nThe neural dynamic response can make reasonable prediction on surrounding\ncomplexity since it can be mapped monotonically to varying SF-TF of visual\nscene. The experiments show this approach is flexible to different visual\nscenes for profiling the dynamic complexity. We also use this metric as a\npredictor to investigate the boundary of another collision detection visual\nsystem performing in changing environment with increasing dynamic complexity.\nThis research demonstrates a new paradigm of using biologically plausible\nvisual processing scheme to estimate dynamic complexity of visual scene from\nboth spatial and temporal perspectives, which could be beneficial to predicting\ninput complexity when evaluating dynamic vision systems.",

This transformer can be applied to a\nwide class of locally checkable labeling (LCL) problems, converting a given\nfault free synchronous algorithm that satisfies certain conditions into a\nself-stabilizing synchronous algorithm for the same problem. The resulting\nself-stabilizing algorithms are anonymous, size-uniform, and \\emph{fully\nadaptive} in the sense that their time complexity is bounded as a function of\nthe number $k$ of nodes that suffered faults (possibly at different times)\nsince the last legal configuration. Specifically, for graphs whose degrees are\nup-bounded by $\\Delta$, the algorithms produced by the transformer stabilize in\ntime proportional to $\\log (k + \\Delta)$ in expectation, independently of the\nnumber of nodes in the graph (in some cases, the dependency on $\\Delta$ can\nalso be omitted). As such, the transformer is applicable also for infinite\ngraphs (with degree bound $\\Delta$). Another appealing feature of the\ntransformer is its small message size overhead. The transformer is applied to\nknown algorithms (or simple variants thereof) for some classic LCL problems,\nproducing the first anonymous size-uniform self-stabilizing algorithms for\nthese problems that are provably fully adaptive.

Modern implementations employ floating\npoint filtering techniques to combine efficiency and robustness, and\nstate-of-the-art predicates are guaranteed to be always exact while being only\nslightly slower than corresponding (inexact) floating point implementations.\nUnfortunately, if the input to these predicates is an intermediate construction\nof an algorithm, its floating point representation may be affected by an\napproximation error, and correctness is no longer guaranteed. This paper\nintroduces the concept of indirect geometric predicate: instead of taking the\nintermediate construction as an explicit input, an indirect predicate considers\nthe primitive geometric elements which are combined to produce such a\nconstruction. This makes it possible to keep track of the floating point\napproximation, and thus to exploit efficient filters and expansion arithmetic\nto exactly resolve the predicate with minimal overhead with respect to a naive\nfloating point implementation.

Developing computer-based\nmethods for assessing infant movements in videos is pivotal for improved\ncerebral palsy screening. Most existing methods use appearance-based features\nand are thus sensitive to strong but irrelevant signals caused by background\nclutter or a moving camera. Moreover, these features are computed over the\nwhole frame, thus they measure gross whole body movements rather than specific\njoint/limb motion.\nAddressing these challenges, we develop and validate a new method for fidgety\nmovement assessment from consumer-grade videos using human poses extracted from\nshort clips.

The dynamics and\ncoordination between joints are modeled using spatio-temporal graph\nconvolutional networks. Frames and body parts that contain discriminative\ninformation about fidgety movements are selected through a spatio-temporal\nattention mechanism. We validate the proposed model on the cerebral palsy\nscreening task using a real-life consumer-grade video dataset collected at an\nAustralian hospital through the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, Australia.

Numerical results for the Lorenz 96 model show\nthat this approach accelerates the minimisation in the first few iterations,\nwith better results when CVT performs well.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge for physically unconstrained gaze estimation is acquiring\ntraining data with 3D gaze annotations for in-the-wild and outdoor scenarios.\nIn contrast, videos of human interactions in unconstrained environments are\nabundantly available and can be much more easily annotated with frame-level\nactivity labels. In this work, we tackle the previously unexplored problem of\nweakly-supervised gaze estimation from videos of human interactions. We\nleverage the insight that strong gaze-related geometric constraints exist when\npeople perform the activity of \"looking at each other\" (LAEO). To acquire\nviable 3D gaze supervision from LAEO labels, we propose a training algorithm\nalong with several novel loss functions especially designed for the task. With\nweak supervision from two large scale CMU-Panoptic and AVA-LAEO activity\ndatasets, we show significant improvements in (a) the accuracy of\nsemi-supervised gaze estimation and (b) cross-domain generalization on the\nstate-of-the-art physically unconstrained in-the-wild Gaze360 gaze estimation\nbenchmark.

As is well known the problem is not\nalways uniquely solvable due to the existence of guided modes, the limiting\nabsorption principle is a standard way to get the unique physical solution.\nBoth methods are based on the Floquet-Bloch transform which transforms the\noriginal problem to an equivalent family of cell problems. The CCI method is\nbased on a modification of integral contours of the inverse transform, and the\ndecomposition method comes from an explicit definition of the radiation\ncondition. Due to the local perturbation, the family of cell problems are\ncoupled thus the whole system is actually defined in 3D. Based on different\ntypes of singularities, high order methods are developed for faster convergence\nrates.

    "abstract": "An emerging recipe for achieving state-of-the-art effectiveness in neural\ndocument re-ranking involves utilizing large pre-trained language models -\ne.g., BERT - to evaluate all individual passages in the document and then\naggregating the outputs by pooling or additional Transformer layers. A major\ndrawback of this approach is high query latency due to the cost of evaluating\nevery passage in the document with BERT. To make matters worse, this high\ninference cost and latency varies based on the length of the document, with\nlonger documents requiring more time and computation. To address this\nchallenge, we adopt an intra-document cascading strategy, which prunes passages\nof a candidate document using a less expensive model, called ESM, before\nrunning a scoring model that is more expensive and effective, called ETM. We\nfound it best to train ESM (short for Efficient Student Model) via knowledge\ndistillation from the ETM (short for Effective Teacher Model) e.g., BERT. This\npruning allows us to only run the ETM model on a smaller set of passages whose\nsize does not vary by document length. Our experiments on the MS MARCO and TREC\nDeep Learning Track benchmarks suggest that the proposed Intra-Document\nCascaded Ranking Model (IDCM) leads to over 400% lower query latency by\nproviding essentially the same effectiveness as the state-of-the-art BERT-based\ndocument ranking models.",

    "abstract": "YouTube has revolutionized the way people discover and consume video.\nAlthough YouTube facilitates easy access to hundreds of well-produced and\ntrustworthy videos, abhorrent, misinformative, and mistargeted content is also\ncommon. The platform is plagued by various types of problematic content: 1)\ndisturbing videos targeting young children; 2) hateful and misogynistic\ncontent; and 3) pseudoscientific misinformation. While YouTube's recommendation\nalgorithm plays a vital role in increasing user engagement and YouTube's\nmonetization, its role in unwittingly promoting problematic content is not\nentirely understood. In this thesis, we shed some light on the degree of\nproblematic content on YouTube and the role of the recommendation algorithm in\nthe dissemination of such content. Following a data-driven quantitative\napproach, we analyze thousands of videos on YouTube, to shed light on: 1) the\nrisks of YouTube media consumption by young children; 2) the role of the\nrecommendation algorithm in the dissemination of misogynistic content, by\nfocusing on the Involuntary Celibates (Incels) community; and 3) user exposure\nto pseudoscientific content on various parts of the platform and how this\nexposure changes based on the user's watch history. Our analysis reveals that\nyoung children are likely to encounter disturbing content when they randomly\nbrowse the platform. By analyzing the Incel community on YouTube, we find that\nIncel activity is increasing over time and that platforms may play an active\nrole in steering users towards extreme content. Finally, when studying\npseudoscientific misinformation, we find that YouTube suggests more\npseudoscientific content regarding traditional pseudoscientific topics (e.g.,\nflat earth) than for emerging ones (like COVID-19) and that these\nrecommendations are more common on the search results page than on a user's\nhomepage or the video recommendations section.",

    "abstract": "Distributional semantics has deeply changed in the last decades. First,\npredict models stole the thunder from traditional count ones, and more recently\nboth of them were replaced in many NLP applications by contextualized vectors\nproduced by Transformer neural language models. Although an extensive body of\nresearch has been devoted to Distributional Semantic Model (DSM) evaluation, we\nstill lack a thorough comparison with respect to tested models, semantic tasks,\nand benchmark datasets. Moreover, previous work has mostly focused on\ntask-driven evaluation, instead of exploring the differences between the way\nmodels represent the lexical semantic space. In this paper, we perform a\ncomprehensive evaluation of type distributional vectors, either produced by\nstatic DSMs or obtained by averaging the contextualized vectors generated by\nBERT. First of all, we investigate the performance of embeddings in several\nsemantic tasks, carrying out an in-depth statistical analysis to identify the\nmajor factors influencing the behavior of DSMs. The results show that i.) the\nalleged superiority of predict based models is more apparent than real, and\nsurely not ubiquitous and ii.) static DSMs surpass contextualized\nrepresentations in most out-of-context semantic tasks and datasets.\nFurthermore, we borrow from cognitive neuroscience the methodology of\nRepresentational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to inspect the semantic spaces\ngenerated by distributional models.

    "abstract": "A total coloring of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is an assignment of colors to\nvertices and edges such that neither two adjacent vertices nor two incident\nedges get the same color, and, for each edge, the end-points and the edge\nitself receive different colors. Any valid total coloring induces a partition\nof the elements of $G$ into total matchings, which are defined as subsets of\nvertices and edges that can take the same color. In this paper, we propose\nInteger Linear Programming models for both the Total Coloring and the Total\nMatching problems, and we study the strength of the corresponding Linear\nProgramming relaxations. The total coloring is formulated as the problem of\nfinding the minimum number of total matchings that cover all the graph\nelements, and we prove that this relaxation is tighter than a natural\nassignment model. This covering formulation can be solved by a column\ngeneration algorithm, where the pricing subproblem corresponds to the Weighted\nTotal Matching Problem. Hence, we study the Total Matching Polytope. We\nintroduce two families of nontrivial valid inequalities: congruent-2k3 cycle\ninequalities based on the parity of the vertex set induced by the cycle, and\nclique inequalities induced by complete subgraphs of even order. We prove that\ncongruent-2k3 cycle inequalities are facet-defining only when k = 4, while the\neven cliques are always facet-defining. Since the separation problem of the\nclique inequalities of even order is NP-hard, we get a polyhedral proof of the\nNP-hardness of the Weighted Total Matching Problem.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems are gaining increasing and critical impacts on human and\nsociety since a growing number of users use them for information seeking and\ndecision making. Therefore, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness\nproblems in recommendations. Just like users have personalized preferences on\nitems, users' demands for fairness are also personalized in many scenarios.\nTherefore, it is important to provide personalized fair recommendations for\nusers to satisfy their personalized fairness demands. Besides, previous works\non fair recommendation mainly focus on association-based fairness.

Based on\nthe above considerations, this paper focuses on achieving personalized\ncounterfactual fairness for users in recommender systems. To this end, we\nintroduce a framework for achieving counterfactually fair recommendations\nthrough adversary learning by generating feature-independent user embeddings\nfor recommendation. The framework allows recommender systems to achieve\npersonalized fairness for users while also covering non-personalized\nsituations.

    "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of results and concepts in minimax robust\nhypothesis testing for two and multiple hypotheses. It starts with an\nintroduction to the subject, highlighting its connection to other areas of\nrobust statistics and giving a brief recount of the most prominent\ndevelopments. Subsequently, the minimax principle is introduced and its\nstrengths and limitations are discussed. The first part of the paper focuses on\nthe two-hypothesis case. After briefly reviewing the basics of statistical\nhypothesis testing, uncertainty sets are introduced as a generic way of\nmodeling distributional uncertainty. The design of minimax detectors is then\nshown to reduce to the problem of determining a pair of least favorable\ndistributions, and different criteria for their characterization are discussed.\nExplicit expressions are given for least favorable distributions under three\ntypes of uncertainty: $\\varepsilon$-contamination, probability density bands,\nand $f$-divergence balls. Using examples, it is shown how the properties of\nthese least favorable distributions translate to properties of the\ncorresponding minimax detectors. The second part of the paper deals with the\nproblem of robustly testing multiple hypotheses, starting with a discussion of\nwhy this is fundamentally different from the binary problem. Sequential\ndetection is then introduced as a technique that enables the design of strictly\nminimax optimal tests in the multi-hypothesis case. Finally, the usefulness of\nrobust detectors in practice is showcased using the example of ground\npenetrating radar. The paper concludes with an outlook on robust detection\nbeyond the minimax principle and a brief summary of the presented material.",

The extended pdADMM-Q algorithm reduces communication cost by\nutilizing the quantization technique.

    "abstract": "Physical-layer security (PLS) for industrial indoor terahertz (THz) wireless\ncommunication applications is considered. We use a similar model as being\nemployed for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) wireless communication\nchannels. A cell communication and a directed communication scenario are\nanalyzed to illustrate the achievable semantic security guarantees for a\nwiretap channel with finite-blocklength THz-wireless communication links. We\nshow that weakly directed transmitter (Alice) antennas, which allow cell-type\ncommunication with multiple legitimate receivers (Bobs) without adaptation of\nthe alignment, result in large insecure regions. In the directed communication\nscenario, the resulting insecure regions are shown to cover a large volume of\nthe indoor environment only if the distance between Alice and Bob is large.\nThus, our results for the two selected scenarios show that there is a stringent\ntrade-off between the targeted semantic security level and the number of\nreliably and securely accessible legitimate receivers. Furthermore, effects of\nsecrecy code parameters and antenna properties on the achievable semantic\nsecurity levels are illustrated to show directions for possible improvements to\nguarantee practically-acceptable security levels with PLS methods for\nindustrial indoor THz-wireless communication applications.",

    "abstract": "Getting the distance to objects is crucial for autonomous vehicles. In\ninstances where depth sensors cannot be used, this distance has to be estimated\nfrom RGB cameras. As opposed to cars, the task of estimating depth from\non-board mounted cameras is made complex on drones because of the lack of\nconstrains on motion during flights. %In the case of drones, this task is even\nmore complex than for car-mounted cameras since the camera motion is\nunconstrained. In this paper, we present a method to estimate the distance of\nobjects seen by an on-board mounted camera by using its RGB video stream and\ndrone motion information. Our method is built upon a pyramidal convolutional\nneural network architecture and uses time recurrence in pair with geometric\nconstraints imposed by motion to produce pixel-wise depth maps. %from a RGB\nvideo stream of a camera attached to the drone In our architecture, each level\nof the pyramid is designed to produce its own depth estimate based on past\nobservations and information provided by the previous level in the pyramid. We\nintroduce a spatial reprojection layer to maintain the spatio-temporal\nconsistency of the data between the levels. We analyse the performance of our\napproach on Mid-Air, a public drone dataset featuring synthetic drone\ntrajectories recorded in a wide variety of unstructured outdoor environments.\nOur experiments show that our network outperforms state-of-the-art depth\nestimation methods and that the use of motion information is the main\ncontributing factor for this improvement.

    "abstract": "In many coalition formation games the utility of the agents depends on a\nsocial network. In such scenarios there might be a manipulative agent that\nwould like to manipulate his connections in the social network in order to\nincrease his utility. We study a model of coalition formation in which a\ncentral organizer, who needs to form $k$ coalitions, obtains information about\nthe social network from the agents. The central organizer has her own\nobjective: she might want to maximize the utilitarian social welfare, maximize\nthe egalitarian social welfare, or simply guarantee that every agent will have\nat least one connection within her coalition. In this paper we study the\nsusceptibility to manipulation of these objectives, given the abilities and\ninformation that the manipulator has. Specifically, we show that if the\nmanipulator has very limited information, namely he is only familiar with his\nimmediate neighbours in the network, then a manipulation is almost always\nimpossible. Moreover, if the manipulator is only able to add connections to the\nsocial network, then a manipulation is still impossible for some objectives,\neven if the manipulator has full information on the structure of the network.\nOn the other hand, if the manipulator is able to hide some of his connections,\nthen all objectives are susceptible to manipulation, even if the manipulator\nhas limited information, i.e., when he is familiar with his immediate\nneighbours and with their neighbours.",

    "abstract": "The H-frame (also known as H-Bot) architecture is a simple and elegant\ntwo-axis parallel positioning system used to construct the XY stage of 3D\nprinters. It holds potential for high speed and excellent dynamic performance\ndue to the use of frame-mounted motors that reduce the moving mass of the\nprinter while allowing for the use of (heavy) higher torque motors. However,\nthe H-frame's dynamic accuracy is limited during high-acceleration and\nhigh-speed motion due to racking -- i.e., parasitic torsional motions of the\nprinter's gantry due to a force couple. Mechanical solutions to the racking\nproblem are either costly or detract from the simplicity of the H-frame. In\nthis paper, we introduce a feedforward software compensation algorithm, based\non the filtered B-splines (FBS) method, that rectifies errors due to racking.\nThe FBS approach expresses the motion command to the machine as a linear\ncombination of B-splines. The B-splines are filtered through an identified\nmodel of the machine dynamics and the control points of the B-spline based\nmotion command are optimized such that the tracking error is minimized. To\ncompensate racking using the FBS algorithm, an accurate frequency response\nfunction of the racking motion is obtained and coupled to the H-frame's x- and\ny-axis dynamics with a kinematic model. The result is a coupled linear\nparameter varying model of the H-frame that is utilized in the FBS framework to\ncompensate racking. An approximation of the proposed racking compensation\nalgorithm, that decouples the x- and y-axis compensation, is developed to\nsignificantly improve its computational efficiency with almost no loss of\ncompensation accuracy. Experiments on an H-frame 3D printer demonstrate a 43\npercent improvement in the shape accuracy of a printed part using the proposed\nalgorithm compared to the standard FBS approach without racking compensation.",

    "abstract": "Existing multi-camera solutions for automatic scorekeeping in steel-tip darts\nare very expensive and thus inaccessible to most players. Motivated to develop\na more accessible low-cost solution, we present a new approach to keypoint\ndetection and apply it to predict dart scores from a single image taken from\nany camera angle. This problem involves detecting multiple keypoints that may\nbe of the same class and positioned in close proximity to one another. The\nwidely adopted framework for regressing keypoints using heatmaps is not\nwell-suited for this task. To address this issue, we instead propose to model\nkeypoints as objects. We develop a deep convolutional neural network around\nthis idea and use it to predict dart locations and dartboard calibration points\nwithin an overall pipeline for automatic dart scoring, which we call DeepDarts.\nAdditionally, we propose several task-specific data augmentation strategies to\nimprove the generalization of our method. As a proof of concept, two datasets\ncomprising 16k images originating from two different dartboard setups were\nmanually collected and annotated to evaluate the system. In the primary dataset\ncontaining 15k images captured from a face-on view of the dartboard using a\nsmartphone, DeepDarts predicted the total score correctly in 94.7% of the test\nimages. In a second more challenging dataset containing limited training data\n(830 images) and various camera angles, we utilize transfer learning and\nextensive data augmentation to achieve a test accuracy of 84.0%.

The result is that data\naccess libraries executed on single clients are often CPU-bound and cannot\nutilize the scale-out benefits of distributed storage systems. One attractive\nsolution to this problem is to offload data-reducing processing and filtering\ntasks to the storage layer.

    "title": "Joint Face Image Restoration and Frontalization for Recognition",
    "abstract": "In real-world scenarios, many factors may harm face recognition performance,\ne.g., large pose, bad illumination,low resolution, blur and noise. To address\nthese challenges, previous efforts usually first restore the low-quality faces\nto high-quality ones and then perform face recognition. However, most of these\nmethods are stage-wise, which is sub-optimal and deviates from the reality. In\nthis paper, we address all these challenges jointly for unconstrained face\nrecognition. We propose an Multi-Degradation Face Restoration (MDFR) model to\nrestore frontalized high-quality faces from the given low-quality ones under\narbitrary facial poses, with three distinct novelties. First, MDFR is a\nwell-designed encoder-decoder architecture which extracts feature\nrepresentation from an input face image with arbitrary low-quality factors and\nrestores it to a high-quality counterpart. Second, MDFR introduces a pose\nresidual learning strategy along with a 3D-based Pose Normalization Module\n(PNM), which can perceive the pose gap between the input initial pose and its\nreal-frontal pose to guide the face frontalization. Finally, MDFR can generate\nfrontalized high-quality face images by a single unified network, showing a\nstrong capability of preserving face identity. Qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments on both controlled and in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of MDFR over state-of-the-art methods on both face frontalization\nand face restoration.",

    "abstract": "There is a prevailing trend to study urban morphology quantitatively thanks\nto the growing accessibility to various forms of spatial big data, increasing\ncomputing power, and use cases benefiting from such information. The methods\ndeveloped up to now measure urban morphology with numerical indices describing\ndensity, proportion, and mixture, but they do not directly represent\nmorphological features from human's visual and intuitive perspective. We take\nthe first step to bridge the gap by proposing a deep learning-based technique\nto automatically classify road networks into four classes on a visual basis.\nThe method is implemented by generating an image of the street network (Colored\nRoad Hierarchy Diagram), which we introduce in this paper, and classifying it\nusing a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-34). The model achieves an\noverall classification accuracy of 0.875. Nine cities around the world are\nselected as the study areas and their road networks are acquired from\nOpenStreetMap. Latent subgroups among the cities are uncovered through a\nclustering on the percentage of each road network category. In the subsequent\npart of the paper, we focus on the usability of such classification: the\neffectiveness of our human perception augmentation is examined by a case study\nof urban vitality prediction. An advanced tree-based regression model is for\nthe first time designated to establish the relationship between morphological\nindices and vitality indicators. A positive effect of human perception\naugmentation is detected in the comparative experiment of baseline model and\naugmented model. This work expands the toolkit of quantitative urban morphology\nstudy with new techniques, supporting further studies in the future.",

Liquid State Machine (LSM) is a bio-inspired\nRC model that mimics the cortical microcircuits and uses spiking neural\nnetworks (SNN) that can be directly realized on neuromorphic hardware. In this\npaper, we present a novel Parallelized LSM (PLSM) architecture that\nincorporates spatio-temporal read-out layer and semantic constraints on model\noutput. To the best of our knowledge, such a formulation has been done for the\nfirst time in literature, and it offers a computationally lighter alternative\nto traditional deep-learning models.

From the\nexperimental results on detecting unintentional action in video, it can be\nobserved that our proposed model outperforms a self-supervised model and a\nfully supervised traditional deep learning model.

Traditionally, anaphora is\nresolved by coreference resolution and ellipses by query rewrite.

Given an\nongoing dialogue between a user and a dialogue assistant, for the user query,\nour joint learning model first predicts coreference links between the query and\nthe dialogue context, and then generates a self-contained rewritten user query.\nTo evaluate our model, we annotate a dialogue based coreference resolution\ndataset, MuDoCo, with rewritten queries. Results show that the performance of\nquery rewrite can be substantially boosted (+2.3% F1) with the aid of\ncoreference modeling.

    "title": "Diversity, Fairness, and Sustainability in Population Protocols",
    "abstract": "Over the years, population protocols with the goal of reaching consensus have\nbeen studied in great depth. However, many systems in the real-world do not\nresult in all agents eventually reaching consensus, but rather in the opposite:\nthey converge to a state of rich diversity. Consider for example task\nallocation in ants. If eventually all ants perform the same task, then the\ncolony will perish (lack of food, no brood care, etc.). Then, it is vital for\nthe survival of the colony to have a diverse set of tasks and enough ants\nworking on each task. What complicates matters is that ants need to switch\ntasks periodically to adjust the needs of the colony; e.g., when too many\nforagers fell victim to other ant colonies. Moreover, all tasks are equally\nimportant and maybe they need to keep certain proportions in the distribution\nof the task. How can ants keep a healthy and balanced allocation of tasks?\nTo answer this question, we propose a simple population protocol for $n$\nagents on a complete graph and an arbitrary initial distribution of $k$ colours\n(tasks). We assume that each colour $i$ has an associated weight (importance)\n$w_i \\geq 1$. By denoting $w$ as the sum of the weights of different colours,\nwe show that the protocol converges in $O(w^2 n \\log n)$ rounds to a\nconfiguration where the number of agents supporting each colour $i$ is\nconcentrated on the fair share $w_in/w$ and will stay concentrated for a large\nnumber of rounds, w.h.p.\nOur protocol has many interesting properties: agents do not need to know\nother colours and weights in the system, and our protocol requires very little\nmemory per agent. Furthermore, the protocol guarantees fairness meaning that\nover a long period each agent has each colour roughly a number of times\nproportional to the weight of the colour. Finally, our protocol also fulfils\nsustainability meaning that no colour ever vanishes.",

It is certainly true that in vision, no current training set fully\ncaptures all visual information and this may lead to Selection Bias. Here, we\ntry a novel approach in the tradition of the Thought Experiment. We run this\nthought experiment on a real domain of visual objects that we can fully\ncharacterize and look at specific gaps in training data and their impact on\nperformance requirements. Our thought experiment points to three conclusions:\nfirst, that generalization behavior is dependent on how sufficiently the\nparticular dimensions of the domain are represented during training; second,\nthat the utility of any generalization is completely dependent on the\nacceptable system error; and third, that specific visual features of objects,\nsuch as pose orientations out of the imaging plane or colours, may not be\nrecoverable if not represented sufficiently in a training set. Any currently\nobserved generalization in modern deep learning networks may be more the result\nof coincidental alignments and whose utility needs to be confirmed with respect\nto a system's performance specification.

It can be difficult to accurately assess code generation performance,\nand there has been surprisingly little work on evaluating code generation in a\nway that is both flexible and rigorous. To meet this challenge, we introduce\nAPPS, a benchmark for code generation. Unlike prior work in more restricted\nsettings, our benchmark measures the ability of models to take an arbitrary\nnatural language specification and generate Python code fulfilling this\nspecification. Similar to how companies assess candidate software developers,\nwe then evaluate models by checking their generated code on test cases. Our\nbenchmark includes 10,000 problems, which range from having simple one-line\nsolutions to being substantial algorithmic challenges. We fine-tune large\nlanguage models on both GitHub and our training set, and we find that the\nprevalence of syntax errors is decreasing exponentially. Recent models such as\nGPT-Neo can pass approximately 15% of the test cases of introductory problems,\nso we find that machine learning models are beginning to learn how to code.

In this paper we\nmake contributions to address both these deficiencies: first, we introduce a\nMulti-Modal High-Precision Clustering algorithm for person-clustering in videos\nusing cues from several modalities (face, body, and voice). Second, we\nintroduce a Video Person-Clustering dataset, for evaluating multi-modal\nperson-clustering. It contains body-tracks for each annotated character,\nface-tracks when visible, and voice-tracks when speaking, with their associated\nfeatures. The dataset is by far the largest of its kind, and covers films and\nTV-shows representing a wide range of demographics. Finally, we show the\neffectiveness of using multiple modalities for person-clustering, explore the\nuse of this new broad task for story understanding through character\nco-occurrences, and achieve a new state of the art on all available datasets\nfor face and person-clustering.",

    "abstract": "The `Black Thursday' crisis in cryptocurrency markets demonstrated\ndeleveraging risks in over-collateralized lending and stablecoins. We develop a\nstochastic model of over-collateralized stablecoins that helps explain such\ncrises. In our model, the stablecoin supply is decided by speculators who\noptimize the profitability of a leveraged position while incorporating the\nforward-looking cost of collateral liquidations, which involves the endogenous\nprice of the stablecoin. We formally characterize regimes that are interpreted\nas stable and unstable for the stablecoin. We prove bounds on the probabilities\nof large deviations and quadratic variation in the stable domain and distinctly\ngreater price variance in the unstable domain. The unstable domain can be\ntriggered by large deviations, collapsed expectations, or liquidity problems\nfrom deleveraging. We formally characterize a deflationary deleveraging spiral\nas a submartingale that can cause the system to behave in counterintuitive ways\ndue to liquidity problems in a crisis. These deleveraging spirals, which\nresemble short squeezes, lead to faster collateral drawdown (and potential\nshortfalls) and are accompanied by higher price variance, as experienced on\nBlack Thursday. We also demonstrate `perfect' stability results in idealized\nsettings and discuss mechanisms which could bring realistic settings closer to\nsuch idealized stable settings.",

While the\nauctioneer takes as given the auction rule of the click-through auction, namely\nthe generalized second-price auction, the auctioneer can design the information\nflow regarding the click-through rates among the bidders. A natural requirement\nin this context is to ask for the information structure to be calibrated in the\nlearning sense. With this constraint, the auction needs to rank the ads by a\nproduct of the bid and an unbiased estimator of the click-through rates, and\nthe task of designing an optimal information structure is thus reduced to the\ntask of designing an optimal unbiased estimator.\nWe show that in a symmetric setting with uncertainty about the click-through\nrates, the optimal information structure attains both social efficiency and\nsurplus extraction. The optimal information structure requires private (rather\nthan public) signals to the bidders.

In order to exploit\ncorrelations, multiple repetitions of the same slice are jointly reconstructed\nunder consideration of permutation-equivariance. The proposed method is trained\non DW liver data of 60 volunteers and evaluated on retrospectively and\nprospectively sub-sampled data of different anatomies and resolutions. In\naddition, the benefits of using a recurrent network over other unrolling\nstrategies is investigated.\nResults: Conventional PF techniques can be significantly outperformed in\nterms of quantitative measures as well as perceptual image quality. The\nproposed method is able to generalize well to brain data with contrasts and\nresolution not present in the training set. The reduction in echo time (TE)\nassociated with prospective PF-sampling enables DW imaging with higher signal.\nAlso, the TE increase in acquisitions with higher resolution can be compensated\nfor. It can be shown that unrolling by means of a recurrent network produced\nbetter results than using a weight-shared network or a cascade of networks.\nConclusion: This work demonstrates that robust PF reconstruction of DW data\nis feasible even at strong PF factors in applications with severe phase\nvariations. Since the proposed method does not rely on smoothness priors of the\nphase but uses learned recurrent convolutions instead, artifacts of\nconventional PF methods can be avoided.",

The\nmodel fully leverages the spatial topology predictive capability of\nconvolutional neural networks, and is coupled with an efficient\ncontinuity-based smoother to predict flow responses that need spatial\ncontinuity. Furthermore, the transient regions are penalized to steer the\ntraining process such that the model can accurately capture flow in these\nregions. The model takes inputs including properties of porous media, fluid\nproperties and well controls, and predicts the temporal-spatial evolution of\nthe state variables (pressure and saturation). While maintaining the continuity\nof fluid flow, the 3D spatial domain is decomposed into 2D images for reducing\ntraining cost, and the decomposition results in an increased number of training\ndata samples and better training efficiency. Additionally, a surrogate model is\nseparately constructed as a postprocessor to calculate well flow rate based on\nthe predictions of state variables from the deep learning model. We use the\nexample of CO2 injection into saline aquifers, and apply the\nphysics-constrained deep learning model that is trained from physics-based\nsimulation data and emulates the physics process. The model performs prediction\nwith a speedup of ~1400 times compared to physics-based simulations, and the\naverage temporal errors of predicted pressure and saturation plumes are 0.27%\nand 0.099% respectively. Furthermore, water production rate is efficiently\npredicted by a surrogate model for well flow rate, with a mean error less than\n5%. Therefore, with its unique scheme to cope with the fidelity in fluid flow\nin porous media, the physics-constrained deep learning model can become an\nefficient predictive model for computationally demanding inverse problems or\nother coupled processes.",

Specifically, in the proposed\ndeformable compensation module, we first apply motion estimation in the feature\nspace to produce motion information (i.e., the offset maps), which will be\ncompressed by using the auto-encoder style network.

Previous approaches to this task are generally\nlimited to the case of a single speaker, but a method that accounts for\nmultiple speakers is desirable as it allows to i) leverage datasets with\nmultiple speakers or few samples per speaker; and ii) control speaker identity\nat inference time. In this paper, we introduce a new video-to-speech\narchitecture and explore ways of extending it to the multi-speaker scenario: we\naugment the network with an additional speaker-related input, through which we\nfeed either a discrete identity or a speaker embedding.

    "abstract": "Background: Extensive clinical evidence suggests that a preventive screening\nof coronary heart disease (CHD) at an earlier stage can greatly reduce the\nmortality rate. We use 64 two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography\n(2D-STE) features and seven clinical features to predict whether one has CHD.\nMethods: We develop a machine learning approach that integrates a number of\npopular classification methods together by model stacking, and generalize the\ntraditional stacking method to a two-step stacking method to improve the\ndiagnostic performance. Results: By borrowing strengths from multiple\nclassification models through the proposed method, we improve the CHD\nclassification accuracy from around 70% to 87.7% on the testing set. The\nsensitivity of the proposed method is 0.903 and the specificity is 0.843, with\nan AUC of 0.904, which is significantly higher than those of the individual\nclassification models.

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: The new type of coronavirus is also called\nCOVID-19. It began to spread at the end of 2019 and has now spread across the\nworld. Until October 2020, It has infected around 37 million people and claimed\nabout 1 million lives. We propose a deep learning model that can help\nradiologists and clinicians use chest X-rays to diagnose COVID-19 cases and\nshow the diagnostic features of pneumonia. Methods: The approach in this study\nis: 1) we propose a data enhancement method to increase the diversity of the\ndata set, thereby improving the generalization performance of the model. 2) Our\ndeep convolution neural network model DPN-SE adds a self-attention mechanism to\nthe DPN network. The addition of a self-attention mechanism has greatly\nimproved the performance of the network. 3) Use the Lime interpretable library\nto mark the feature regions on the X-ray medical image that helps doctors more\nquickly diagnose COVID-19 in people. Results: Under the same network model, the\ndata with and without data enhancement is put into the model for training\nrespectively. At last, comparing two experimental results: among the 10 network\nmodels with different structures, 7 network models have improved their effects\nafter using data enhancement, with an average improvement of 1% in recognition\naccuracy. We propose that the accuracy and recall rates of the DPN-SE network\nare 93% and 98% of cases (COVID vs. pneumonia bacteria vs. viral pneumonia vs.\nnormal). Compared with the original DPN, the respective accuracy is improved by\n2%. Conclusion: The data augmentation method we used has achieved effective\nresults on a small amount of data set, showing that a reasonable data\naugmentation method can improve the recognition accuracy without changing the\nsample size and model structure. Overall, the proposed method and model can\neffectively become a very useful tool for clinical radiologists.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the linear programming (LP) formulation for deep\nreinforcement learning. The number of the constraints depends on the size of\nstate and action spaces, which makes the problem intractable in large or\ncontinuous environments. The general augmented Lagrangian method suffers the\ndouble-sampling obstacle in solving the LP. Namely, the conditional\nexpectations originated from the constraint functions and the quadratic\npenalties in the augmented Lagrangian function impose difficulties in sampling\nand evaluation. Motivated from the updates of the multipliers, we overcome the\nobstacles in minimizing the augmented Lagrangian function by replacing the\nintractable conditional expectations with the multipliers. Therefore, a deep\nparameterized augment Lagrangian method is proposed. Furthermore, the\nreplacement provides a promising breakthrough to integrate the two steps in the\naugmented Lagrangian method into a single constrained problem. A general\ntheoretical analysis shows that the solutions generated from a sequence of the\nconstrained optimizations converge to the optimal solution of the LP if the\nerror is controlled properly. A theoretical analysis on the quadratic penalty\nalgorithm under neural tangent kernel setting shows the residual can be\narbitrarily small if the parameter in network and optimization algorithm is\nchosen suitably. Preliminary experiments illustrate that our method is\ncompetitive to other state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The novel corona virus (Covid-19) has introduced significant challenges due\nto its rapid spreading nature through respiratory transmission. As a result,\nthere is a huge demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based quick disease\ndiagnosis methods as an alternative to high demand tests such as Polymerase\nChain Reaction (PCR). Chest X-ray (CXR) Image analysis is such cost-effective\nradiography technique due to resource availability and quick screening. But, a\nsufficient and systematic data collection that is required by complex deep\nleaning (DL) models is more difficult and hence there are recent efforts that\nutilize transfer learning to address this issue. Still these transfer learnt\nmodels suffer from lack of generalization and increased bias to the training\ndataset resulting poor performance for unseen data. Limited correlation of the\ntransferred features from the pre-trained model to a specific medical imaging\ndomain like X-ray and overfitting on fewer data can be reasons for this\ncircumstance. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Convolution Neural Network\n(GCN) that is capable of identifying bio-markers of Covid-19 pneumonia from CXR\nimages and meta information about patients. The proposed method exploits\nimportant relational knowledge between data instances and their features using\ngraph representation and applies convolution to learn the graph data which is\nnot possible with conventional convolution on Euclidean domain.

The electric potential is expressed as an ansatz\nincorporating neural networks with known leading order behaviors and symmetries\nand the Laplace's equation is then solved with boundary conditions at the\ndielectric interface by minimizing a loss function.

The Kronecker sum or the Cartesian product of two\ngraphs, each modeling dependencies across features and across samples, has been\nused as an inverse covariance matrix for a matrix-variate Gaussian\ndistribution, as an alternative to a Kronecker-product inverse covariance\nmatrix, due to its more intuitive sparse structure.

In particular, the framework is well suited\nfor algorithms that are implemented in an inexact or stochastic fashion because\nof (i) stochastic errors emerging in algorithmic steps, and because (ii) the\nalgorithm may feature random coordinate updates. To this end, the paper focuses\non separable operators of the form $T x = (T_1 x, \\ldots, T_n x)$, defined over\nthe direct sum of possibly infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and\ninvestigates the convergence of the associated stochastic Banach-Picard\niteration. Results in terms of convergence in mean and in high-probability are\npresented when the errors affecting the operator follow a sub-Weibull\ndistribution and when updates $T_i x$ are performed based on a Bernoulli random\nvariable. In particular, the results are derived for the cases where $T$ is\ncontractive and averaged in terms of convergence to the unique fixed point and\ncumulative fixed-point residual, respectively. The results do not assume\nvanishing errors or vanishing parameters of the operator, as typical in the\nliterature (this case is subsumed by the proposed framework), and links with\nexiting results in terms of almost sure convergence are provided. In the online\noptimization context, the operator changes at each iteration to reflect changes\nin the underlying optimization problem. This leads to an online Banach-Picard\niteration, and similar results are derived where the bounds for the convergence\nin mean and high-probability further depend on the evolution of fixed points\n(i.e., optimal solutions of the time-varying optimization problem).",

Our contributions towards rapid\nlarge-scale testing include a novel deep learning architecture capable of\nanalyzing ultrasound data that can run in real-time and significantly improve\nthe current state-of-the-art detection accuracies using image-based COVID-19\ndetection.",

    "abstract": "Phase retrieval problems in antenna measurements arise when a reference phase\ncannot be provided to all measurement locations. Phase retrieval algorithms\nrequire sufficiently many independent measurement samples of the radiated\nfields to be successful. Larger amounts of independent data may improve the\nreconstruction of the phase information from magnitude-only measurements. We\nshow how the knowledge of relative phases among the spectral components of a\nmodulated signal at the individual measurement locations may be employed to\nreconstruct the relative phases between different measurement locations at all\nfrequencies. Projection matrices map the estimated phases onto the space of\nfields possibly generated by equivalent antenna under test (AUT) sources at all\nfrequencies. In this way, the phase of the reconstructed solution is not only\nrestricted by the measurement samples at one frequency, but by the samples at\nallfrequencies simultaneously. The proposed method can increase the amount of\nindependent phase information even if all probes are located in the far field\nof the AUT.",
