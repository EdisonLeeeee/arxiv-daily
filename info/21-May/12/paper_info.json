    "abstract": "Polly is the LLVM project's polyhedral loop nest optimizer. Recently,\nuser-directed loop transformation pragmas were proposed based on LLVM/Clang and\nPolly. The search space exposed by the transformation pragmas is a tree,\nwherein each node represents a specific combination of loop transformations\nthat can be applied to the code resulting from the parent node's loop\ntransformations. We have developed a search algorithm based on Monte Carlo tree\nsearch (MCTS) to find the best combination of loop transformations. Our\nalgorithm consists of two phases: exploring loop transformations at different\ndepths of the tree to identify promising regions in the tree search space and\nexploiting those regions by performing a local search. Moreover, a restart\nmechanism is used to avoid the MCTS getting trapped in a local solution. The\nbest and worst solutions are transferred from the previous phases of the\nrestarts to leverage the search history. We compare our approach with random,\ngreedy, and breadth-first search methods on PolyBench kernels and ECP proxy\napplications. Experimental results show that our MCTS algorithm finds pragma\ncombinations with a speedup of 2.3x over Polly's heuristic optimizations on\naverage.",

    "abstract": "Robots assisting us in factories or homes must learn to make use of objects\nas tools to perform tasks, e.g., a tray for carrying objects. We consider the\nproblem of learning commonsense knowledge of when a tool may be useful and how\nits use may be composed with other tools to accomplish a high-level task\ninstructed by a human. We introduce TANGO, a novel neural model for predicting\ntask-specific tool interactions. TANGO is trained using demonstrations obtained\nfrom human teachers instructing a virtual robot in a physics simulator. TANGO\nencodes the world state comprising of objects and symbolic relationships\nbetween them using a graph neural network. The model learns to attend over the\nscene using knowledge of the goal and the action history, finally decoding the\nsymbolic action to execute. Crucially, we address generalization to unseen\nenvironments where some known tools are missing, but alternative unseen tools\nare present. We show that by augmenting the representation of the environment\nwith pre-trained embeddings derived from a knowledge-base, the model can\ngeneralize effectively to novel environments. Experimental results show a\n60.5-78.9% improvement over the baseline in predicting successful symbolic\nplans in unseen settings for a simulated mobile manipulator.",

    "abstract": "With the recent progress in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), it is\nimperative for media and visual forensics to develop detectors which can\nidentify and attribute images to the model generating them. Existing works have\nshown to attribute images to their corresponding GAN sources with high\naccuracy. However, these works are limited to a closed set scenario, failing to\ngeneralize to GANs unseen during train time and are therefore, not scalable\nwith a steady influx of new GANs.

Our\nalgorithm consists of multiple components including network training,\nout-of-distribution detection, clustering, merge and refine steps. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that our algorithm discovers unseen GANs with\nhigh accuracy and also generalizes to GANs trained on unseen real datasets. We\nadditionally apply our algorithm to attribution and discovery of GANs in an\nonline fashion as well as to the more standard task of real/fake detection.

    "abstract": "A natural way of increasing our understanding of NP-complete graph problems\nis to restrict the input to a special graph class. Classes of $H$-free graphs,\nthat is, graphs that do not contain some graph $H$ as an induced subgraph, have\nproven to be an ideal testbed for such a complexity study. However, if the\nforbidden graph $H$ contains a cycle or claw, then these problems often stay\nNP-complete. A recent complexity study on the $k$-Colouring problem shows that\nwe may still obtain tractable results if we also bound the diameter of the\n$H$-free input graph. We continue this line of research by initiating a\ncomplexity study on the impact of bounding the diameter for a variety of\nclassical vertex partitioning problems restricted to $H$-free graphs. We prove\nthat bounding the diameter does not help for Independent Set, but leads to new\ntractable cases for problems closely related to 3-Colouring. That is, we show\nthat Near-Bipartiteness, Independent Feedback Vertex Set, Independent Odd Cycle\nTransversal, Acyclic 3-Colouring and Star 3-Colouring are all polynomial-time\nsolvable for chair-free graphs of bounded diameter.

    "abstract": "Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) is a well-known NP-complete problem. Despite\nthis theoretical hardness, SAT solvers based on Conflict Driven Clause Learning\n(CDCL) can solve large SAT instances from many important domains. CDCL learns\nclauses from conflicts, a technique that allows a solver to prune its search\nspace. The selection heuristics in CDCL prioritize variables that are involved\nin recent conflicts. While only a fraction of decisions generate any conflicts,\nmany generate multiple conflicts.\nIn this paper, we study conflict-generating decisions in CDCL in detail. We\ninvestigate the impact of single conflict (sc) decisions, which generate only\none conflict, and multi-conflict (mc) decisions which generate two or more. We\nempirically characterize these two types of decisions based on the quality of\nthe learned clauses produced by each type of decision. We also show an\nimportant connection between consecutive clauses learned within the same mc\ndecision, where one learned clause triggers the learning of the next one\nforming a chain of clauses. This leads to the consideration of similarity\nbetween conflicts, for which we formulate the notion of conflictsproximity as a\nsimilarity measure. We show that conflicts in mc decisions are more closely\nrelated than consecutive conflicts generated from sc decisions. Finally, we\ndevelop Common Reason Variable Reduction (CRVR) as a new decision strategy that\nreduces the selection priority of some variables from the learned clauses of mc\ndecisions. Our empirical evaluation of CRVR implemented in three leading\nsolvers demonstrates performance gains in benchmarks from the main track of SAT\nCompetition-2020.",

However, as the recorded signals are\nsparse and quite noisy, online performance and global translation estimation\nturn out to be two key difficulties. In this paper, we present TransPose, a\nDNN-based approach to perform full motion capture (with both global\ntranslations and body poses) from only 6 Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) at\nover 90 fps. For body pose estimation, we propose a multi-stage network that\nestimates leaf-to-full joint positions as intermediate results. This design\nmakes the pose estimation much easier, and thus achieves both better accuracy\nand lower computation cost.

Quantitative and\nqualitative comparisons show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art\nlearning- and optimization-based methods with a large margin in both accuracy\nand efficiency.

    "abstract": "Ontologies formalise how the concepts from a given domain are interrelated.\nDespite their clear potential as a backbone for explainable AI, existing\nontologies tend to be highly incomplete, which acts as a significant barrier to\ntheir more widespread adoption. To mitigate this issue, we present a mechanism\nto infer plausible missing knowledge, which relies on reasoning by analogy. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that studies analogical\nreasoning within the setting of description logic ontologies. After showing\nthat the standard formalisation of analogical proportion has important\nlimitations in this setting, we introduce an alternative semantics based on\nbijective mappings between sets of features. We then analyse the properties of\nanalogies under the proposed semantics, and show among others how it enables\ntwo plausible inference patterns: rule translation and rule extrapolation.",

The fact that automatic summarization\nmay produce plausible-sounding yet inaccurate summaries is a major concern that\nlimits its wide application. In this paper we present an approach to address\nfactual consistency in summarization. We first propose an efficient automatic\nevaluation metric to measure factual consistency; next, we propose a novel\nlearning algorithm that maximizes the proposed metric during model training.\nThrough extensive experiments, we confirm that our method is effective in\nimproving factual consistency and even overall quality of the summaries, as\njudged by both automatic metrics and human evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) is a critical indicator in economic\nstudies, while it can be used to forecast a recession. Under higher levels of\nuncertainty, firms' owners cut their investment, which leads to a longer\npost-recession recovery. EPU index is computed by counting news articles\ncontaining pre-defined keywords related to policy-making and economy and convey\nuncertainty. Unfortunately, this method is sensitive to the original keyword\nset, its richness, and the news coverage. Thus, reproducing its results for\ndifferent countries is challenging. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised\ntext mining method that uses word-embedding representation space to select\nrelevant keywords. This method is not strictly sensitive to the semantic\nsimilarity threshold applied to the word embedding vectors and does not require\na pre-defined dictionary.

    "abstract": "Video prediction is commonly referred to as forecasting future frames of a\nvideo sequence provided several past frames thereof. It remains a challenging\ndomain as visual scenes evolve according to complex underlying dynamics, such\nas the camera's egocentric motion or the distinct motility per individual\nobject viewed. These are mostly hidden from the observer and manifest as often\nhighly non-linear transformations between consecutive video frames. Therefore,\nvideo prediction is of interest not only in anticipating visual changes in the\nreal world but has, above all, emerged as an unsupervised learning rule\ntargeting the formation and dynamics of the observed environment. Many of the\ndeep learning-based state-of-the-art models for video prediction utilize some\nform of recurrent layers like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) or Gated Recurrent\nUnits (GRUs) at the core of their models. Although these models can predict the\nfuture frames, they rely entirely on these recurrent structures to\nsimultaneously perform three distinct tasks: extracting transformations,\nprojecting them into the future, and transforming the current frame. In order\nto completely interpret the formed internal representations, it is crucial to\ndisentangle these tasks. This paper proposes a fully differentiable building\nblock that can perform all of those tasks separately while maintaining\ninterpretability. We derive the relevant theoretical foundations and showcase\nresults on synthetic as well as real data. We demonstrate that our method is\nreadily extended to perform motion segmentation and account for the scene's\ncomposition, and learns to produce reliable predictions in an entirely\ninterpretable manner by only observing unlabeled video data.",

This also allows us to use BERT-like models that\nare already trained on large amounts of text.\nWhile the proposed model has wide applications, we demonstrate its\ncapabilities on data-to-text generation tasks.

Big data has enabled us to carry out countless\nprediction tasks in conjunction with machine learning, such as identifying high\nrisk patients suffering from a certain disease and taking preventable measures.\nHowever, healthcare practitioners are not content with mere predictions - they\nare also interested in the cause-effect relation between input features and\nclinical outcomes.

Though substantial progress has been made in estimating 3D\nhuman motion and shape from dynamic observations, recovering plausible pose\nsequences in the presence of noise and occlusions remains a challenge. For this\npurpose, we propose an expressive generative model in the form of a conditional\nvariational autoencoder, which learns a distribution of the change in pose at\neach step of a motion sequence. Furthermore, we introduce a flexible\noptimization-based approach that leverages HuMoR as a motion prior to robustly\nestimate plausible pose and shape from ambiguous observations. Through\nextensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our model generalizes to diverse\nmotions and body shapes after training on a large motion capture dataset, and\nenables motion reconstruction from multiple input modalities including 3D\nkeypoints and RGB(-D) videos.",

    "abstract": "Designing efficient exploration is central to Reinforcement Learning due to\nthe fundamental problem posed by the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Bayesian\nexploration strategies like Thompson Sampling resolve this trade-off in a\nprincipled way by modeling and updating the distribution of the parameters of\nthe the action-value function, the outcome model of the environment. However,\nthis technique becomes infeasible for complex environments due to the\ndifficulty of representing and updating probability distributions over\nparameters of outcome models of corresponding complexity. Moreover, the\napproximation techniques introduced to mitigate this issue typically result in\npoor exploration-exploitation trade-offs, as observed in the case of deep\nneural network models with approximate posterior methods that have been shown\nto underperform in the deep bandit scenario.\nIn this paper we introduce Sample Average Uncertainty (SAU), a simple and\nefficient uncertainty measure for contextual bandits. While Bayesian approaches\nlike Thompson Sampling estimate outcomes uncertainty indirectly by first\nquantifying the variability over the parameters of the outcome model, SAU is a\nfrequentist approach that directly estimates the uncertainty of the outcomes\nbased on the value predictions. Importantly, we show theoretically that the\nuncertainty measure estimated by SAU asymptotically matches the uncertainty\nprovided by Thompson Sampling, as well as its regret bounds. Because of its\nsimplicity SAU can be seamlessly applied to deep contextual bandits as a very\nscalable drop-in replacement for epsilon-greedy exploration. Finally, we\nempirically confirm our theory by showing that SAU-based exploration\noutperforms current state-of-the-art deep Bayesian bandit methods on several\nreal-world datasets at modest computation cost.",

    "abstract": "Multi-access edge computing (MEC) and network virtualization technologies are\nimportant enablers for fifth-generation (5G) networks to deliver diverse\napplications and services. Services are often provided as fully connected\nvirtual network functions (VNF)s, through service function chaining (SFC).\nHowever, the problem of allocating SFC resources at the network edge still\nfaces many challenges related to the way VNFs are placed, chained and\nscheduled. In this paper, to solve these problems, we propose a game\ntheory-based approach with the objective to reduce service latency in the\ncontext of SFC at the network edge. The problem of allocating SFC resources can\nbe divided into two subproblems. 1) The VNF placement and routing subproblem,\nand 2) the VNF scheduling subproblem. For the former subproblem, we formulate\nit as a mean field game (MFG) in which VNFs are modeled as entities contending\nover edge resources with the goal of reducing the resource consumption of MEC\nnodes and reducing latency for users. We propose a on a reinforcement\nlearning-based technique, where the Ishikawa-Mann learning algorithm (IMLA) is\nused. For the later subproblem we formulate it as a matching game between the\nVFNs and an edge resources in order to find the execution order of the VNFs\nwhile reducing the latency. To efficiently solve it, we propose a modified\nversion of the many-to-one deferred acceptance algorithm (DAA), called the\nenhanced multi-step deferred acceptance algorithm (eMSDA). To illustrate the\nperformance of the proposed approaches, we perform extensive simulations.

In particular, these data structures achieve approximation on the order\nof $p$ for $\\ell_p^d$ norms with space complexity nearly linear in the dataset\nsize $n$ and polynomial in the dimension $d$, and query time sub-linear in $n$\nand polynomial in $d$. The main shortcoming is the exponential in $d$\npre-processing time required for their construction.\nIn this paper, we describe a more direct framework for constructing NNS data\nstructures for general norms. More specifically, we show via an algorithmic\nreduction that an efficient NNS data structure for a given metric is implied by\nan efficient average distortion embedding of it into $\\ell_1$ or into Euclidean\nspace. In particular, the resulting data structures require only polynomial\npre-processing time, as long as the embedding can be computed in polynomial\ntime. As a concrete instantiation of this framework, we give an NNS data\nstructure for $\\ell_p$ with efficient pre-processing that matches the\napproximation factor, space and query complexity of the aforementioned data\nstructure of Andoni et al.

    "abstract": "Although tremendous strides have been made in uncontrolled face detection,\nefficient face detection with a low computation cost as well as high precision\nremains an open challenge. In this paper, we point out that training data\nsampling and computation distribution strategies are the keys to efficient and\naccurate face detection. Motivated by these observations, we introduce two\nsimple but effective methods (1) Sample Redistribution (SR), which augments\ntraining samples for the most needed stages, based on the statistics of\nbenchmark datasets; and (2) Computation Redistribution (CR), which reallocates\nthe computation between the backbone, neck and head of the model, based on a\nmeticulously defined search methodology. Extensive experiments conducted on\nWIDER FACE demonstrate the state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-off for\nthe proposed \\scrfd family across a wide range of compute regimes. In\nparticular, \\scrfdf{34} outperforms the best competitor, TinaFace, by $3.86\\%$\n(AP at hard set) while being more than \\emph{3$\\times$ faster} on GPUs with\nVGA-resolution images. We also release our code to facilitate future research.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to conventional pipeline Spoken Language Understanding (SLU)\nwhich consists of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language\nunderstanding (NLU), end-to-end SLU infers the semantic meaning directly from\nspeech and overcomes the error propagation caused by ASR. End-to-end slot\nfilling (SF) from speech is an essential component of end-to-end SLU, and is\nusually regarded as a sequence-to-sequence generation problem, heavily relied\non the performance of language model of ASR. However, it is hard to generate a\ncorrect slot when the slot is out-of-vovabulary (OOV) in training data,\nespecially when a slot is an anti-linguistic entity without grammatical rule.\nInspired by object detection in computer vision that is to detect the object\nfrom an image, we consider SF as the task of slot detection from speech. In\nthis paper, we formulate the SF task as a matching task and propose an\nend-to-end knowledge-based SF model, named Speech-to-Slot (Speech2Slot), to\nleverage knowledge to detect the boundary of a slot from the speech. We also\nrelease a large-scale dataset of Chinese speech for slot filling, containing\nmore than 830,000 samples. The experiments show that our approach is markedly\nsuperior to the conventional pipeline SLU approach, and outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art end-to-end SF approach with 12.51% accuracy improvement.",

    "abstract": "Complex scientific experiments from various domains are typically modeled as\nworkflows and executed on large-scale machines using a Parallel Workflow\nManagement System (WMS). Since such executions usually last for hours or days,\nsome WMSs provide user steering support, i.e., they allow users to run data\nanalyses and, depending on the results, adapt the workflows at runtime. A\nchallenge in the parallel execution control design is to manage workflow data\nfor efficient executions while enabling user steering support. Data access for\nhigh scalability is typically transaction-oriented, while for data analysis, it\nis online analytical-oriented so that managing such hybrid workloads makes the\nchallenge even harder. In this work, we present SchalaDB, an architecture with\na set of design principles and techniques based on distributed in-memory data\nmanagement for efficient workflow execution control and user steering. We\npropose a distributed data design for scalable workflow task scheduling and\nhigh availability driven by a parallel and distributed in-memory DBMS. To\nevaluate our proposal, we develop d-Chiron, a WMS designed according to\nSchalaDB's principles. We carry out an extensive experimental evaluation on an\nHPC cluster with up to 960 computing cores. Among other analyses, we show that\neven when running data analyses for user steering, SchalaDB's overhead is\nnegligible for workloads composed of hundreds of concurrent tasks on shared\ndata. Our results encourage workflow engine developers to follow a parallel and\ndistributed data-oriented approach not only for scheduling and monitoring but\nalso for user steering.",

Given limited energy storage, we expect to maximize the peak-demand\nreduction in an online fashion, challenged by the highly uncertain demands and\nrenewable injections, the non-cumulative nature of peak consumption, and the\ncoupling of online decisions. In this paper, we propose an optimal online\nalgorithm that achieves the best competitive ratio, following the idea of\nmaintaining a constant ratio between the online and the optimal offline\npeak-reduction performance. We further show that the optimal competitive ratio\ncan be computed by solving a linear number of linear-fractional programs.\nMoreover, we extend the algorithm to adaptively maintain the best competitive\nratio given the revealed inputs and actions at each decision-making round. The\nadaptive algorithm retains the optimal worst-case guarantee and attains\nimproved average-case performance. We evaluate our proposed algorithms using\nreal-world traces and show that they obtain up to 81% peak reduction of the\noptimal offline benchmark. Additionally, the adaptive algorithm achieves at\nleast 20% more peak reduction against baseline alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to solve the problem of knowledge\ntransfer from labeled source domain to unlabeled target domain. Recently, many\ndomain adaptation (DA) methods use centroid to align the local distribution of\ndifferent domains, that is, to align different classes. This improves the\neffect of domain adaptation, but domain differences exist not only between\nclasses, but also between samples. This work rethinks what is the alignment\nbetween different domains, and studies how to achieve the real alignment\nbetween different domains. Previous DA methods only considered one distribution\nfeature of aligned samples, such as full distribution or local distribution. In\naddition to aligning the global distribution, the real domain adaptation should\nalso align the meso distribution and the micro distribution. Therefore, this\nstudy propose a double classifier method based on high confidence label (DCP).\nBy aligning the centroid and the distribution between centroid and sample of\ndifferent classifiers, the meso and micro distribution alignment of different\ndomains is realized. In addition, in order to reduce the chain error caused by\nerror marking, This study propose a high confidence marking method to reduce\nthe marking error. To verify its versatility, this study evaluates DCP on\ndigital recognition and target recognition data sets.

    "abstract": "The prevalent convolutional neural network (CNN) based image denoising\nmethods extract features of images to restore the clean ground truth, achieving\nhigh denoising accuracy. However, these methods may ignore the underlying\ndistribution of clean images, inducing distortions or artifacts in denoising\nresults. This paper proposes a new perspective to treat image denoising as a\ndistribution learning and disentangling task. Since the noisy image\ndistribution can be viewed as a joint distribution of clean images and noise,\nthe denoised images can be obtained via manipulating the latent representations\nto the clean counterpart. This paper also provides a distribution learning\nbased denoising framework. Following this framework, we present an invertible\ndenoising network, FDN, without any assumptions on either clean or noise\ndistributions, as well as a distribution disentanglement method. FDN learns the\ndistribution of noisy images, which is different from the previous CNN based\ndiscriminative mapping. Experimental results demonstrate FDN's capacity to\nremove synthetic additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) on both category-specific\nand remote sensing images. Furthermore, the performance of FDN surpasses that\nof previously published methods in real image denoising with fewer parameters\nand faster speed.

In this framework, ULTR algorithms\nhave to rely on a large amount of user data that are collected, stored, and\naggregated by central servers.\nIn this paper, we consider an on-device search setting, where users search\nagainst their personal corpora on their local devices, and the goal is to learn\na ranking function from biased user interactions. Due to privacy constraints,\nusers' queries, personal documents, results lists, and raw interaction data\nwill not leave their devices, and ULTR has to be carried out via Federated\nLearning (FL).\nDirectly applying existing ULTR algorithms on users' devices could suffer\nfrom insufficient training data due to the limited amount of local\ninteractions. To address this problem, we propose the FedIPS algorithm, which\nlearns from user interactions on-device under the coordination of a central\nserver and uses click propensities to remove the position bias in user\ninteractions. Our evaluation of FedIPS on the Yahoo and Istella datasets shows\nthat FedIPS is robust over a range of position biases.",

    "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) have revolutionized the\nconventional recommendation paradigm by embracing dialogue agents to\ndynamically capture the fine-grained user preference. In a typical\nconversational recommendation scenario, a CRS firstly generates questions to\nlet the user clarify her/his demands and then makes suitable recommendations.\nHence, the ability to generate suitable clarifying questions is the key to\ntimely tracing users' dynamic preferences and achieving successful\nrecommendations. However, existing CRSs fall short in asking high-quality\nquestions because: (1) system-generated responses heavily depends on the\nperformance of the dialogue policy agent, which has to be trained with huge\nconversation corpus to cover all circumstances; and (2) current CRSs cannot\nfully utilize the learned latent user profiles for generating appropriate and\npersonalized responses.\nTo mitigate these issues, we propose the Knowledge-Based Question Generation\nSystem (KBQG), a novel framework for conversational recommendation. Distinct\nfrom previous conversational recommender systems, KBQG models a user's\npreference in a finer granularity by identifying the most relevant relations\nfrom a structured knowledge graph (KG). Conditioned on the varied importance of\ndifferent relations, the generated clarifying questions could perform better in\nimpelling users to provide more details on their preferences.

However, existing\nmethods perform contrastive learning on selected samples between teacher and\nstudent networks, which is sensitive to noises in pseudo labels and neglects\nthe relationship among most samples. Moreover, these methods are not effective\nin cooperation of different teacher networks. To handle these issues, this\npaper proposes a Graph Consistency based Mean-Teaching (GCMT) method with\nconstructing the graph consistency constraint between teacher and student\nnetworks. Specifically, given unlabeled training images, we apply teacher\nnetworks to extract corresponding features and further construct a teacher\ngraph for each teacher network to describe the similarity relationships among\ntraining images. To boost the representation learning, different teacher graphs\nare fused to provide the supervise signal for optimizing student networks. GCMT\nfuses similarity relationships predicted by different teacher networks as\nsupervision and effectively optimizes student networks with more sample\nrelationships involved. Experiments on three datasets, i.e., Market-1501,\nDukeMTMCreID, and MSMT17, show that proposed GCMT outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods by clear margin.

Especially, for the cold-start item which\nonly has limited interactions, it is hard to train a reasonable item ID\nembedding, called cold ID embedding, which is a major challenge for the\nembedding techniques. The cold item ID embedding has two main problems: (1) A\ngap is existing between the cold ID embedding and the deep model. (2) Cold ID\nembedding would be seriously affected by noisy interaction. However, most\nexisting methods do not consider both two issues in the cold-start problem,\nsimultaneously. To address these problems, we adopt two key ideas: (1) Speed up\nthe model fitting for the cold item ID embedding (fast adaptation). (2)\nAlleviate the influence of noise. Along this line, we propose Meta Scaling and\nShifting Networks to generate scaling and shifting functions for each item,\nrespectively. The scaling function can directly transform cold item ID\nembeddings into warm feature space which can fit the model better, and the\nshifting function is able to produce stable embeddings from the noisy\nembeddings.

Further, three clustering techniques are applied to the normal\nentities in order to aggregate similar behaviours, mitigate the imbalance\nproblem and reduce noisy data.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to learn spatial\nfeatures for high-resolution (HR) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image\nclassification. However, there has been little work on integrating the unique\nstatistical distributions of SAR images which can reveal physical properties of\nterrain objects, into CNNs in a supervised feature learning framework. To\naddress this problem, a novel end-to-end supervised classification method is\nproposed for HR SAR images by considering both spatial context and statistical\nfeatures. First, to extract more effective spatial features from SAR images, a\nnew deep spatial context encoder network (DSCEN) is proposed, which is a\nlightweight structure and can be effectively trained with a small number of\nsamples. Meanwhile, to enhance the diversity of statistics, the nonstationary\njoint statistical model (NS-JSM) is adopted to form the global statistical\nfeatures. Specifically, SAR images are transformed into the Gabor wavelet\ndomain and the produced multi-subbands magnitudes and phases are modeled by the\nlog-normal and uniform distribution. The covariance matrix is further utilized\nto capture the inter-scale and intra-scale nonstationary correlation between\nthe statistical subbands and make the joint statistical features more compact\nand distinguishable. Considering complementary advantages, a feature fusion\nnetwork (Fusion-Net) base on group compression and smooth normalization is\nconstructed to embed the statistical features into the spatial features and\noptimize the fusion feature representation. As a result, our model can learn\nthe discriminative features and improve the final classification performance.\nExperiments on four HR SAR images validate the superiority of the proposed\nmethod over other related algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Despite the accomplishments of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in\nmodeling data distributions, training them remains a challenging task. A\ncontributing factor to this difficulty is the non-intuitive nature of the GAN\nloss curves, which necessitates a subjective evaluation of the generated output\nto infer training progress. Recently, motivated by game theory, duality gap has\nbeen proposed as a domain agnostic measure to monitor GAN training. However, it\nis restricted to the setting when the GAN converges to a Nash equilibrium. But\nGANs need not always converge to a Nash equilibrium to model the data\ndistribution. In this work, we extend the notion of duality gap to proximal\nduality gap that is applicable to the general context of training GANs where\nNash equilibria may not exist. We show theoretically that the proximal duality\ngap is capable of monitoring the convergence of GANs to a wider spectrum of\nequilibria that subsumes Nash equilibria. We also theoretically establish the\nrelationship between the proximal duality gap and the divergence between the\nreal and generated data distributions for different GAN formulations. Our\nresults provide new insights into the nature of GAN convergence. Finally, we\nvalidate experimentally the usefulness of proximal duality gap for monitoring\nand influencing GAN training.",

We propose an optimal transmit\nstrategy which maximizes a weighted sum of the average harvested powers at the\nEH nodes under a constraint on the power budget of the transmitter. First, for\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) WPT systems, we show that it is optimal to\ntransmit scalar symbols with an arbitrary phase and an amplitude, whose\nprobability density function (pdf) has at most two mass points, using maximum\nratio transmission (MRT) beamforming. Then, we prove that for single-input\nmultiple-output (SIMO) WPT systems, the optimal transmit symbol amplitudes are\ndiscrete random variables, whose pdf also has no more than two mass points. For\ngeneral multi-user MIMO WPT systems, we show that the optimal transmit strategy\ninvolves scalar unit-norm symbols with arbitrary phase and at most two\nbeamforming vectors. In order to determine these vectors, we formulate a\nnon-convex optimization problem and obtain an optimal solution based on\nmonotonic optimization. Since the computational complexity of the optimal\nsolution is high, we also propose a low-complexity iterative algorithm to\nobtain a suboptimal solution, which achieves nearly optimal performance. Our\nsimulation results reveal that the proposed transmit strategy for multi-user\nMIMO WPT systems outperforms two baseline schemes, which are based on a linear\nEH model and a single beamforming vector, respectively. For a given transmit\npower budget, we show that the harvested power saturates when increasing the\nnumber of transmit antennas.

In contrast, backdoor\nattack aims to implant triggers into a model during the training stage, such\nthat the victim model acts normally on the clean data unless a trigger is\npresent in a sample. This work follows a typical setting of clean-label\nbackdoor attack, where a few poisoned samples (with their content tampered yet\nlabels unchanged) are injected into the training set. The unique contributions\nof MorphNet are two-fold. First, it is key to ensure the implanted triggers\nboth visually imperceptible to humans and lead to high attack success rate on\nthe point clouds. To this end, MorphNet jointly optimizes two objectives for\nsample-adaptive poisoning: a reconstruction loss that preserves the visual\nsimilarity between benign / poisoned point clouds, and a classification loss\nthat enforces a modern recognition model of point clouds tends to mis-classify\nthe poisoned sample to a pre-specified target category. This implicitly\nconducts spectral separation over point clouds, hiding sample-adaptive triggers\nin fine-grained high-frequency details. Secondly, existing backdoor attack\nmethods are mainly designed for image data, easily defended by some point cloud\nspecific operations (such as denoising). We propose a third loss in MorphNet\nfor suppressing isolated points, leading to improved resistance to\ndenoising-based defense. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on ModelNet40\nand ShapeNetcorev2. Our proposed Poisoning MorphNet outstrips all previous\nmethods with clear margins.",

In this tutorial\narticle, we address such a compelling yet difficult question by embarking on a\njourney from 5G to 6G and sharing a large number of realistic case studies\nsupported by original results. We start by overviewing the status quo on UAV\ncommunications from an industrial standpoint, providing fresh updates from the\n3GPP and detailing new 5G NR features in support of aerial devices. We then\nshow the potential and the limitations of such features. In particular, we\ndemonstrate how sub-6 GHz massive MIMO can successfully tackle cell selection\nand interference challenges, we showcase encouraging mmWave coverage\nevaluations in both urban and suburban/rural settings, and we examine the\npeculiarities of direct device-to-device communications in the sky. Moving on,\nwe sneak a peek at next-generation UAV communications, listing some of the use\ncases envisioned for the 2030s. We identify the most promising 6G enablers for\nUAV communication, those expected to take the performance and reliability to\nthe next level. For each of these disruptive new paradigms (non-terrestrial\nnetworks, cell-free architectures, artificial intelligence, reconfigurable\nintelligent surfaces, and THz communications), we gauge the prospective\nbenefits for UAVs and discuss the main technological hurdles that stand in the\nway.

This pandemic was\nharsh on different levels for almost all populations worldwide and this is what\ndrove researchers and scientists to get involved and work on several kinds of\nsimulations to get a better insight into this virus and be able to stop it the\nearliest possible. In this study, we simulate the spread of COVID-19 in Lebanon\nusing an Agent-Based Model where people are modeled as agents that have\nspecific characteristics and behaviors determined from statistical\ndistributions using Monte Carlo Algorithm. These agents can go into the world,\ninteract with each other, and thus, infect each other. This is how the virus\nspreads. During the simulation, we can introduce different Non-Pharmaceutical\nInterventions - or more commonly NPIs - that aim to limit the spread of the\nvirus (wearing a mask, closing locations, etc). Our Simulator was first\nvalidated on concepts (e.g. Flattening the Curve and Second Wave scenario), and\nthen it was applied on the case of Lebanon. We studied the effect of opening\nschools and universities on the pandemic situation in the country since the\nLebanese Ministry of Education is planning to do so progressively, starting\nfrom 21 April 2021.

    "abstract": "The rise of personal assistants has made conversational question answering\n(ConvQA) a very popular mechanism for user-system interaction. State-of-the-art\nmethods for ConvQA over knowledge graphs (KGs) can only learn from crisp\nquestion-answer pairs found in popular benchmarks. In reality, however, such\ntraining data is hard to come by: users would rarely mark answers explicitly as\ncorrect or wrong. In this work, we take a step towards a more natural learning\nparadigm - from noisy and implicit feedback via question reformulations. A\nreformulation is likely to be triggered by an incorrect system response,\nwhereas a new follow-up question could be a positive signal on the previous\nturn's answer. We present a reinforcement learning model, termed CONQUER, that\ncan learn from a conversational stream of questions and reformulations. CONQUER\nmodels the answering process as multiple agents walking in parallel on the KG,\nwhere the walks are determined by actions sampled using a policy network. This\npolicy network takes the question along with the conversational context as\ninputs and is trained via noisy rewards obtained from the reformulation\nlikelihood. To evaluate CONQUER, we create and release ConvRef, a benchmark\nwith about 11k natural conversations containing around 205k reformulations.\nExperiments show that CONQUER successfully learns to answer conversational\nquestions from noisy reward signals, significantly improving over a\nstate-of-the-art baseline.",

Experimental data availability notwithstanding has\nincreased significantly, but interpretable and explainable models in science\nand engineering yet remain incomprehensible. In this work, we blend machine\nlearning and dictionary-based learning with numerical analysis tools to\ndiscover governing differential equations from noisy and sparsely-sampled\nmeasurement data. We utilize the fact that given a dictionary containing huge\ncandidate nonlinear functions, dynamical models can often be described by a few\nappropriately chosen candidates. As a result, we obtain interpretable and\nparsimonious models which are prone to generalize better beyond the sampling\nregime. Additionally, we integrate a numerical integration framework with\ndictionary learning that yields differential equations without requiring or\napproximating derivative information at any stage. Hence, it is utterly\neffective in corrupted and sparsely-sampled data. We discuss its extension to\ngoverning equations, containing rational nonlinearities that typically appear\nin biological networks. Moreover, we generalized the method to governing\nequations that are subject to parameter variations and externally controlled\ninputs.

    "abstract": "Image deblurring has seen a great improvement with the development of deep\nneural networks. In practice, however, blurry images often suffer from\nadditional degradations such as downscaling and compression. To address these\nchallenges, we propose an Enhanced Deep Pyramid Network (EDPN) for blurry image\nrestoration from multiple degradations, by fully exploiting the self- and\ncross-scale similarities in the degraded image.Specifically, we design two\npyramid-based modules, i.e., the pyramid progressive transfer (PPT) module and\nthe pyramid self-attention (PSA) module, as the main components of the proposed\nnetwork. By taking several replicated blurry images as inputs, the PPT module\ntransfers both self- and cross-scale similarity information from the same\ndegraded image in a progressive manner. Then, the PSA module fuses the above\ntransferred features for subsequent restoration using self- and\nspatial-attention mechanisms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly outperforms existing solutions for blurry image super-resolution\nand blurry image deblocking. In the NTIRE 2021 Image Deblurring Challenge, EDPN\nachieves the best PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS scores in Track 1 (Low Resolution) and the\nbest SSIM/LPIPS scores in Track 2 (JPEG Artifacts).",

By jointly training\nthese models, the common latent representation can be obtained which encodes\nmore complementary information from multiple views and depicts data more\ncomprehensively.

Nowadays, this problem can be addressed using\nmodern techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), but over the\nyears different classical methods have been developed. In this report, we\nimplement an image classifier using both classic computer vision and deep\nlearning techniques. Specifically, we study the performance of a Bag of Visual\nWords classifier using Support Vector Machines, a Multilayer Perceptron, an\nexisting architecture named InceptionV3 and our own CNN, TinyNet, designed from\nscratch. We evaluate each of the cases in terms of accuracy and loss, and we\nobtain results that vary between 0.6 and 0.96 depending on the model and\nconfiguration used.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale interaction networks of human communication are often modeled as\ncomplex graph structures, obscuring temporal patterns within individual\nconversations. To facilitate the understanding of such conversational dynamics,\nepisodes with low or high communication activity as well as breaks in\ncommunication need to be detected to enable the identification of temporal\ninteraction patterns. Traditional episode detection approaches are highly\ndependent on the choice of parameters, such as window-size or\nbinning-resolution. In this paper, we present a novel technique for the\nidentification of relevant episodes in bi-directional interaction sequences\nfrom abstract communication networks. We model communication as a continuous\ndensity function, allowing for a more robust segmentation into individual\nepisodes and estimation of communication volume. Additionally, we define a\ntailored feature set to characterize conversational dynamics and enable a\nuser-steered classification of communication behavior. We apply our technique\nto a real-world corpus of email data from a large European research\ninstitution. The results show that our technique allows users to effectively\ndefine, identify, and analyze relevant communication episodes.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to\ntheir biological plausibility and high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic chips.\nAs these chips are usually resource-constrained, the compression of SNNs is\nthus crucial along the road of practical use of SNNs. Most existing methods\ndirectly apply pruning approaches in artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs,\nwhich ignore the difference between ANNs and SNNs, thus limiting the\nperformance of the pruned SNNs. Besides, these methods are only suitable for\nshallow SNNs. In this paper, inspired by synaptogenesis and synapse elimination\nin the neural system, we propose gradient rewiring (Grad R), a joint learning\nalgorithm of connectivity and weight for SNNs, that enables us to seamlessly\noptimize network structure without retrain. Our key innovation is to redefine\nthe gradient to a new synaptic parameter, allowing better exploration of\nnetwork structures by taking full advantage of the competition between pruning\nand regrowth of connections. The experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod achieves minimal loss of SNNs' performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset\nso far. Moreover, it reaches a $\\sim$3.5% accuracy loss under unprecedented\n0.73% connectivity, which reveals remarkable structure refining capability in\nSNNs. Our work suggests that there exists extremely high redundancy in deep\nSNNs. Our codes are available at\n\\url{https://github.com/Yanqi-Chen/Gradient-Rewiring}.",

Since its advent, the verification paradigm of smart\ncontract has been improving toward high scalability. It shifts from the\nexpensive on-chain verification to the orchestration of off-chain VM (virtual\nmachine) execution and on-chain arbitration with the pinpoint protocol. The\nrepresentative projects are TrueBit, Arbitrum, YODA, ACE, and Optimism.\nInspired by visionaries in academia and industry, we consider the DNN\ncomputation to be promising but on the next level of complexity for the\nverification paradigm of smart contract. Unfortunately, even for the\nstate-of-the-art verification paradigm, off-chain VM execution of DNN\ncomputation has an orders-of-magnitude slowdown compared to the native\noff-chain execution.\nTo enable the native off-chain execution of verifiable DNN computation, we\npresent Agatha system, which solves the significant challenges of misalignment\nand inconsistency: (1) Native DNN computation has a graph-based computation\nparadigm misaligned with previous VM-based execution and arbitration; (2)\nNative DNN computation may be inconsistent cross platforms which invalidates\nthe verification paradigm. In response, we propose the graph-based pinpoint\nprotocol (GPP) which enables the pinpoint protocol on computational graphs, and\nbridges the native off-chain execution and the contract arbitration. We also\ndevelop a technique named Cross-evaluator Consistent Execution (XCE), which\nguarantees cross-platform consistency and forms the correctness foundation of\nGPP. We showcase Agatha for the DNN computation of popular models (MobileNet,\nResNet50 and VGG16) on Ethereum. Agatha achieves a negligible on-chain\noverhead, and an off-chain execution overhead of 3.0%, which represents an\noff-chain latency reduction of at least 602x compared to the state-of-the-art\nverification paradigm.",

In the present paper, we bring the idea one dimension\nhigher and advocate that template games should not be just defined as\n1-dimensional categories but as 2-dimensional categories of positions,\ntrajectories and reshufflings (or reschedulings) as 2-cells. In order to\nachieve the purpose, we take seriously the parallel between asynchrony in\nconcurrency and the Gray tensor product of 2-categories. One technical\ndifficulty on the way is that the category S=2-Cat of small 2-categories\nequipped with the Gray tensor product is monoidal, and not cartesian. This\nprompts us to extend the framework of template games originally formulated by\nMelli\\`es in a category S with finite limits, and to upgrade it in the style of\nAguiar's work on quantum groups to the more general situation of a monoidal\ncategory S with coreflexive equalizers, preserved by the tensor product\ncomponentwise.

This paper proposes the first Megapixel level method for\none shot Face Swapping (or MegaFS for short). Firstly, MegaFS organizes face\nrepresentation hierarchically by the proposed Hierarchical Representation Face\nEncoder (HieRFE) in an extended latent space to maintain more facial details,\nrather than compressed representation in previous face swapping methods.\nSecondly, a carefully designed Face Transfer Module (FTM) is proposed to\ntransfer the identity from a source image to the target by a non-linear\ntrajectory without explicit feature disentanglement. Finally, the swapped faces\ncan be synthesized by StyleGAN2 with the benefits of its training stability and\npowerful generative capability. Each part of MegaFS can be trained separately\nso the requirement of our model for GPU memory can be satisfied for megapixel\nface swapping.

The strongly-coupled relationships among robots and tasks, the\nredundancy of the MPDA encoding, and the variable-size decision space of the\nMO-MPDA problem posed extra challenges for addressing the problem effectively.\nTo address the above issues, we develop a hybrid decomposition-based\nmulti-objective evolutionary algorithm (HDMOEA) using $ \\varepsilon\n$-constraint method. It selects the maximal completion time of all tasks as the\nmain objective, and converted the other objective into constraints. HDMOEA\ndecomposes a MO-MPDA problem into a series of scalar constrained optimization\nsubproblems by assigning each subproblem with an upper bound robot number. All\nthe subproblems are optimized simultaneously with the transferring knowledge\nfrom other subproblems. Besides, we develop a hybrid population initialisation\nmechanism to enhance the quality of initial solutions, and a reproduction\nmechanism to transmit effective information and tackle the encoding redundancy.\nExperimental results show that the proposed HDMOEA method significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of several most-used metrics.",

    "abstract": "Sparse Matrix Vector multiplication (SpMV) is one of basic building blocks in\nscientific computing, and acceleration of SpMV has been continuously required.\nIn this research, we aim for accelerating SpMV on recent CPUs for sparse\nmatrices that have a specific sparsity structure, namely a diagonally\nstructured sparsity pattern. We focus a hybrid storage format that combines the\nDIA and CSR formats, so-called the HDC format. First, we recall the importance\nof introducing cache blocking techniques into HDC-based SpMV kernels. Next,\nbased on the observation of the cache blocked kernel, we present a modified\nversion of the HDC formats, which we call the M-HDC format, in which partial\ndiagonal structures are expected to be more efficiently picked up. For these\nSpMV kernels, we theoretically analyze the expected performance improvement\nbased on performance models. Then, we conduct comprehensive experiments on\nstate-of-the-art multi-core CPUs. By the experiments using typical matrices, we\nclarify the detailed performance characteristics of each SpMV kernel. We also\nevaluate the performance for matrices appearing in practical applications and\ndemonstrate that our approach can accelerate SpMV for some of them. Through the\npresent paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of exploiting partial diagonal\nstructures by the M-HDC format as a promising approach to accelerating SpMV on\nCPUs for a certain kind of practical sparse matrices.",

In\nthis paper, we analyze the capabilities of transformer-based language models on\nthis unsupervised task, using benchmarks obtained from educational settings, as\nwell as more commonly used datasets.

Overall the best results were obtained with GPT-2 and RoBERTa,\nwhile configurations using BERT were not able to outperform word embedding\nmodels.

    "abstract": "APIs are the primary mechanism for developers to gain access to externally\ndefined services and tools. However, previous research has revealed API misuses\nthat violate the contract of APIs to be prevalent. Such misuses can have\nharmful consequences, especially in the context of cryptographic libraries.\nVarious API misuse detectors have been proposed to address this issue including\nCogniCrypt, one of the most versatile of such detectors and that uses a\nlanguage CrySL to specify cryptographic API usage contracts. Nonetheless,\nexisting approaches to detect API misuse had not been designed for systematic\nreuse, ignoring the fact that different versions of a library, different\nversions of a platform, and different recommendations or guidelines might\nintroduce variability in the correct usage of an API. Yet, little is known\nabout how such variability impacts the specification of the correct API usage.\nThis paper investigates this question by analyzing the impact of various\nsources of variability on widely used Java cryptographic libraries including\nJCA, Bouncy Castle, and Google Tink. The results of our investigation show that\nsources of variability like new versions of the API and security standards\nsignificantly impact the specifications. We then use the insights gained from\nour investigation to motivate an extension to the CrySL language named\nMetaCrySL, which builds on meta programming concepts. We evaluate MetaCrySL by\nspecifying usage rules for a family of Android versions and illustrate that\nMetaCrySL can model all forms of variability we identified and drastically\nreduce the size of a family of specifications for the correct usage of\ncryptographic APIs",

    "abstract": "A self-learning adaptive system (SLAS) uses machine learning to enable and\nenhance its adaptability. Such systems are expected to perform well in dynamic\nsituations. For learning high-performance adaptation policy, some assumptions\nmust be made on the environment-system dynamics when information about the real\nsituation is incomplete. However, these assumptions cannot be expected to be\nalways correct, and yet it is difficult to enumerate all possible assumptions.\nThis leads to the problem of incomplete-information learning. We consider this\nproblem as multiple model problem in terms of finding the adaptation policy\nthat can cope with multiple models of environment-system dynamics. This paper\nproposes a novel approach to engineering the online adaptation of SLAS. It\nseparates three concerns that are related to the adaptation policy and presents\nthe modeling and synthesis process, with the goal of achieving higher model\nconstruction efficiency. In addition, it designs a meta-reinforcement learning\nalgorithm for learning the meta policy over the multiple models, so that the\nmeta policy can quickly adapt to the real environment-system dynamics. At last,\nit reports the case study on a robotic system to evaluate the adaptability of\nthe approach.",

    "abstract": "Migration and replication of virtual network functions (VNFs) are well-known\nmechanisms to face dynamic resource requests in Internet Service Provider (ISP)\nedge networks. They are not only used to reallocate resources in carrier\nnetworks, but in case of excessive traffic churns also to offloading VNFs to\nthird party cloud providers. We propose to study how traffic forecasting can\nhelp to reduce the number of required migrations and replications when the\ntraffic dynamically changes in the network. We analyze and compare three\nscenarios for the VNF migrations and replications based on: (i) the current\nobserved traffic demands only, (ii) specific maximum traffic demand value\nobserved in the past, or (iii) predictive traffic values. For the prediction of\ntraffic demand values, we use an LSTM model which is proven to be one of the\nmost accurate methods in time series forecasting problems. Based the traffic\nprediction model, we then use a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model\nas well as a greedy algorithm to solve this optimization problem that considers\nmigrations and replications of VNFs. The results show that LSTM-based traffic\nprediction can reduce the number of migrations up to 45\\% when there is enough\navailable resources to allocate replicas, while less cloud-based offloading is\nrequired compared to overprovisioning.",

    "abstract": "Domain adaptive semantic segmentation refers to making predictions on a\ncertain target domain with only annotations of a specific source domain.\nCurrent state-of-the-art works suggest that performing category alignment can\nalleviate domain shift reasonably. However, they are mainly based on\nimage-to-image adversarial training and little consideration is given to\nsemantic variations of an object among images, failing to capture a\ncomprehensive picture of different categories. This motivates us to explore a\nholistic representative, the semantic distribution from each category in source\ndomain, to mitigate the problem above. In this paper, we present semantic\ndistribution-aware contrastive adaptation algorithm that enables pixel-wise\nrepresentation alignment under the guidance of semantic distributions.\nSpecifically, we first design a pixel-wise contrastive loss by considering the\ncorrespondences between semantic distributions and pixel-wise representations\nfrom both domains. Essentially, clusters of pixel representations from the same\ncategory should cluster together and those from different categories should\nspread out. Next, an upper bound on this formulation is derived by involving\nthe learning of an infinite number of (dis)similar pairs, making it efficient.\nFinally, we verify that SDCA can further improve segmentation accuracy when\nintegrated with the self-supervised learning. We evaluate SDCA on multiple\nbenchmarks, achieving considerable improvements over existing algorithms.The\ncode is publicly available at https://github.com/BIT-DA/SDCA",

    "abstract": "Consider a truck filled with boxes of varying size and unknown mass and an\nindustrial robot with end-effectors that can unload multiple boxes from any\nreachable location. In this work, we investigate how would the robot with the\nhelp of a simulator, learn to maximize the number of boxes unloaded by each\naction. Most high-fidelity robotic simulators like ours are time-consuming.\nTherefore, we investigate the above learning problem with a focus on minimizing\nthe number of simulation runs required. The optimal decision-making problem\nunder this setting can be formulated as a multi-class classification problem.\nHowever, to obtain the outcome of any action requires us to run the\ntime-consuming simulator, thereby restricting the amount of training data that\ncan be collected. Thus, we need a data-efficient approach to learn the\nclassifier and generalize it with a minimal amount of data. A high-fidelity\nphysics-based simulator is common in general for complex manipulation tasks\ninvolving multi-body interactions. To this end, we train an optimal decision\ntree as the classifier, and for each branch of the decision tree, we reason\nabout the confidence in the decision using a Probably Approximately Correct\n(PAC) framework to determine whether more simulator data will help reach a\ncertain confidence level. This provides us with a mechanism to evaluate when\nsimulation can be avoided for certain decisions, and when simulation will\nimprove the decision making. For the truck unloading problem, our experiments\nshow that a significant reduction in simulator runs can be achieved using the\nproposed method as compared to naively running the simulator to collect data to\ntrain equally performing decision trees.",

    "abstract": "(Partial) ranking loss is a commonly used evaluation measure for multi-label\nclassification, which is usually optimized with convex surrogates for\ncomputational efficiency. Prior theoretical work on multi-label ranking mainly\nfocuses on (Fisher) consistency analyses. However, there is a gap between\nexisting theory and practice -- some pairwise losses can lead to promising\nperformance but lack consistency, while some univariate losses are consistent\nbut usually have no clear superiority in practice. In this paper, we attempt to\nfill this gap through a systematic study from two complementary perspectives of\nconsistency and generalization error bounds of learning algorithms. Our results\nshow that learning algorithms with the consistent univariate loss have an error\nbound of $O(c)$ ($c$ is the number of labels), while algorithms with the\ninconsistent pairwise loss depend on $O(\\sqrt{c})$ as shown in prior work. This\nexplains that the latter can achieve better performance than the former in\npractice. Moreover, we present an inconsistent reweighted univariate loss-based\nlearning algorithm that enjoys an error bound of $O(\\sqrt{c})$ for promising\nperformance as well as the computational efficiency of univariate losses.\nFinally, experimental results validate our theoretical analyses.",

    "abstract": "The deep learning algorithm has achieved great success in the field of\ncomputer vision, but some studies have pointed out that the deep learning model\nis vulnerable to attacks adversarial examples and makes false decisions. This\nchallenges the further development of deep learning, and urges researchers to\npay more attention to the relationship between adversarial examples attacks and\ndeep learning security. This work focuses on adversarial examples, optimizes\nthe generation of adversarial examples from the view of adversarial robustness,\ntakes the perturbations added in adversarial examples as the optimization\nparameter. We propose RWR-NM-PGD attack algorithm based on random warm restart\nmechanism and improved Nesterov momentum from the view of gradient\noptimization. The algorithm introduces improved Nesterov momentum, using its\ncharacteristics of accelerating convergence and improving gradient update\ndirection in optimization algorithm to accelerate the generation of adversarial\nexamples. In addition, the random warm restart mechanism is used for\noptimization, and the projected gradient descent algorithm is used to limit the\nrange of the generated perturbations in each warm restart, which can obtain\nbetter attack effect. Experiments on two public datasets show that the\nalgorithm proposed in this work can improve the success rate of attacking deep\nlearning models without extra time cost. Compared with the benchmark attack\nmethod, the algorithm proposed in this work can achieve better attack success\nrate for both normal training model and defense model. Our method has average\nattack success rate of 46.3077%, which is 27.19% higher than I-FGSM and 9.27%\nhigher than PGD. The attack results in 13 defense models show that the attack\nalgorithm proposed in this work is superior to the benchmark algorithm in\nattack universality and transferability.",

The\nbasic idea behind our method is to reduce the data into a two-dimensional space\nand then rank each data point in the reduced space. We attempt to estimate the\ndegree of anomaly in both spatial and density domains. Specifically, we\ntransform the data points into a density space and measure the distances in\ndensity domain between each point and its k-Nearest Neighbors in spatial\ndomain. Then, an anomaly coordinate system is built by collecting two\nunilateral anomalies from k-nearest neighbors of each point.

Experiments performed on the synthetic and real world\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs well and achieve highest\naverage performance. We also show that the proposed method can provide\nvisualization and classification of the anomalies in a simple manner. Due to\nthe complexity of the anomaly, none of the existing methods can perform best on\nall benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "The Subgraph Isomorphism problem is of considerable importance in computer\nscience. We examine the problem when the pattern graph H is of bounded\ntreewidth, as occurs in a variety of applications. This problem has a\nwell-known algorithm via color-coding that runs in time $O(n^{tw(H)+1})$ [Alon,\nYuster, Zwick'95], where $n$ is the number of vertices of the host graph $G$.\nWhile there are pattern graphs known for which Subgraph Isomorphism can be\nsolved in an improved running time of $O(n^{tw(H)+1-\\varepsilon})$ or even\nfaster (e.g. for $k$-cliques), it is not known whether such improvements are\npossible for all patterns. The only known lower bound rules out time\n$n^{o(tw(H) / \\log(tw(H)))}$ for any class of patterns of unbounded treewidth\nassuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis [Marx'07].\nIn this paper, we demonstrate the existence of maximally hard pattern graphs\n$H$ that require time $n^{tw(H)+1-o(1)}$.

One of\nthe most important aspects of cloud computing for IaaS is resource management.\nScalability, quality of service, optimum utility, reduced overheads, increased\nthroughput, reduced latency, specialised environment, cost effectiveness, and a\nstreamlined interface are some of the advantages of resource management for\nIaaS in cloud computing. Traditionally, resource management has been done\nthrough static policies, which impose certain limitations in various dynamic\nscenarios, prompting cloud service providers to adopt data-driven,\nmachine-learning-based approaches. Machine learning is being used to handle a\nvariety of resource management tasks, including workload estimation, task\nscheduling, VM consolidation, resource optimization, and energy optimization,\namong others. This paper provides a detailed review of challenges in ML-based\nresource management in current research, as well as current approaches to\nresolve these challenges, as well as their advantages and limitations. Finally,\nwe propose potential future research directions based on identified challenges\nand limitations in current research.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are currently\napplied to a wide range of products and solutions. DL training jobs are highly\nresource demanding and they experience great benefits when exploiting AI\naccelerators (e.g., GPUs).

It is tiny (as few as 50 KB executable), robust\n(replaying long executions without divergence), portable (running in a POSIX\nOS, in TEE, or on baremetal), and quick to launch (speeding up startup by up to\ntwo orders of magnitude).

    "abstract": "The paper introduces a novel, holistic approach for robust Screen-Camera\nCommunication (SCC), where video content on a screen is visually encoded in a\nhuman-imperceptible fashion and decoded by a camera capturing images of such\nscreen content. We first show that state-of-the-art SCC techniques have two key\nlimitations for in-the-wild deployment: (a) the decoding accuracy drops rapidly\nunder even modest screen extraction errors from the captured images, and (b)\nthey generate perceptible flickers on common refresh rate screens even with\nminimal modulation of pixel intensity. To overcome these challenges, we\nintroduce DeepLight, a system that incorporates machine learning (ML) models in\nthe decoding pipeline to achieve humanly-imperceptible, moderately high SCC\nrates under diverse real-world conditions. Deep-Light's key innovation is the\ndesign of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based decoder that collectively decodes\nall the bits spatially encoded in a display frame, without attempting to\nprecisely isolate the pixels associated with each encoded bit. In addition,\nDeepLight supports imperceptible encoding by selectively modulating the\nintensity of only the Blue channel, and provides reasonably accurate screen\nextraction (IoU values >= 83%) by using state-of-the-art object detection DNN\npipelines. We show that a fully functional DeepLight system is able to robustly\nachieve high decoding accuracy (frame error rate < 0.2) and moderately-high\ndata goodput (>=0.95Kbps) using a human-held smartphone camera, even over\nlarger screen-camera distances (approx =2m).",

An essential requirement for these algorithms is the\navailability of accurate partial derivatives of the equations of motion with\nrespect to the state and control variables. State of the art methods for\ncalculating the derivatives use analytical differentiation methods based on the\nchain rule, and although these methods are an improvement over\nfinite-difference in terms of accuracy, they are not always the most efficient.\nIn this paper, we present an analytical method for calculating the first-order\npartial derivatives of rigid-body dynamics. The method uses Featherstone's\nspatial vector algebra and is presented in a recursive form similar to the\nRecursive-Newton Euler Algorithm (RNEA). Several dynamics identities and\ncomputational options are exploited for efficiency. The algorithms are\nbench-marked against competing approaches in Fortran and C++. Timing results\nare presented for kinematic trees with up to 500 links. As an example, the 100\nlink case leads to a 7x speedup over our Fortran implementation of the existing\nstate-of-the-art method. Preliminary comparison of compute timings for the\npartial derivatives of inverse dynamics in C++ are also shown versus the\nexisting Pinocchio framework.

    "abstract": "False claims about COVID-19 vaccines can undermine public trust in ongoing\nvaccination campaigns, thus posing a threat to global public health.\nMisinformation originating from various sources has been spreading online since\nthe beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we present a dataset of\nTwitter posts that exhibit a strong anti-vaccine stance. The dataset consists\nof two parts: a) a streaming keyword-centered data collection with more than\n1.8 million tweets, and b) a historical account-level collection with more than\n135 million tweets. The former leverages the Twitter streaming API to follow a\nset of specific vaccine-related keywords starting from mid-October 2020. The\nlatter consists of all historical tweets of 70K accounts that were engaged in\nthe active spreading of anti-vaccine narratives. We present descriptive\nanalyses showing the volume of activity over time, geographical distributions,\ntopics, news sources, and inferred account political leaning. This dataset can\nbe used in studying anti-vaccine misinformation on social media and enable a\nbetter understanding of vaccine hesitancy.

This inconsistency is\nknown as the doctrinal paradox, which plays a central role in the field of\njudgment aggregation. Despite a large body of literature on the worst-case\nanalysis of the doctrinal paradox, little is known about its likelihood under\nnatural statistical models, except for a few i.i.d. distributions [List, 2005].\nIn this paper, we characterize the likelihood of the doctrinal paradox under\na much more general and realistic model called the smoothed social choice\nframework [Xia, 2020b], where agents' ground truth judgments are arbitrarily\ncorrelated while the noises are independent. Our main theorem states that under\nmild conditions, the smoothed likelihood of the doctrinal paradox is either\n$0$, $\\exp(-\\Theta(n))$, $\\Theta(n^{-1/2})$ or $\\Theta(1)$.

These abilities have been mostly\nlacking in robots, sometimes making them appear awkward and socially inept.\nHere we propose an end-to-end long-term visual prediction framework for robots\nto begin to acquire both these critical cognitive skills, known as Visual\nPerspective Taking (VPT) and Theory of Behavior (TOB). We demonstrate our\napproach in the context of visual hide-and-seek - a game that represents a\ncognitive milestone in human development. Unlike traditional visual predictive\nmodel that generates new frames from immediate past frames, our agent can\ndirectly predict to multiple future timestamps (25s), extrapolating by 175%\nbeyond the training horizon.

For $n$ points in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$, we present a scheme to construct a $2$-approximation of the\nfiltration of the Rips complex in the $L_\\infty$-norm, which extends to a\n$2d^{0.25}$-approximation in the Euclidean case.

The scheme is\nbased on the integer lattice and simplicial complexes based on the barycentric\nsubdivision of the $d$-cube.\nWe extend our result to use cubical complexes in place of simplicial\ncomplexes by introducing cubical maps between complexes. We get the same\napproximation guarantee as the simplicial case, while reducing the total size\nof the approximation to only $n2^{O(d)}$ (cubical) cells.\nThere are two novel techniques that we use in this paper. The first is the\nuse of acyclic carriers for proving our approximation result. In our\napplication, these are maps which relate the Rips complex and the approximation\nin a relatively simple manner and greatly reduce the complexity of showing the\napproximation guarantee.

In such a scenario, identifying an\nefficient knowledge representation becomes a challenging problem. Most research\nworks propose to either store a subset of examples from the past tasks in a\nreplay buffer, dedicate a separate set of parameters to each task or penalize\nexcessive updates over parameters by introducing a regularization term. While\nexisting methods employ the general task-agnostic stochastic gradient descent\nupdate rule, we propose a task-aware optimizer that adapts the learning rate\nbased on the relatedness among tasks. We utilize the directions taken by the\nparameters during the updates by accumulating the gradients specific to each\ntask. These task-based accumulated gradients act as a knowledge base that is\nmaintained and updated throughout the stream.

However, pipelines are long and access to all\nparts of it is a chal-lenging task; current in-pipe robots have the limitations\nof short-distance inspection and inability to operate in-service networks. In\nthis work, we improve the design of our previously developed in-pipe robot and\nanalyze the effect of line pressure and relative velocity on the robot during\noperation with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. An extreme\nscenario for robot operation is defined and we estimate the minimum inspection\ndistance for the robot with one turn of battery charge that is 5400m. A\nmulti-phase motion controller is proposed that ensures reliable motion at\nstraight and non-straight configurations of pipeline and also stabilized\nconfiguration with zero velocity at junctions. We also propose a localization\nand navigation method based on particle filtering and combine it with the\nproposed multi-phase motion controller. In this method, the map of the\noperation is provided to the robot and the robot localizes itself based on the\nmap and the particle filtering method. Furthermore, the robot navigates\ndifferent configurations of pipelines by switching between different phases of\nthe motion controller algorithm that is performed by the particle filter\nalgorithm.

    "abstract": "Despite the prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, there is little\ninformation about the purpose and risks of the Internet traffic these devices\ngenerate, and consumers have limited options for controlling those risks. A key\nopen question is whether one can mitigate these risks by automatically blocking\nsome of the Internet connections from IoT devices, without rendering the\ndevices inoperable. In this paper, we address this question by developing a\nrigorous methodology that relies on automated IoT-device experimentation to\nreveal which network connections (and the information they expose) are\nessential, and which are not. We further develop strategies to automatically\nclassify network traffic destinations as either required (i.e., their traffic\nis essential for devices to work properly) or not, hence allowing firewall\nrules to block traffic sent to non-required destinations without breaking the\nfunctionality of the device. We find that indeed 16 among the 31 devices we\ntested have at least one blockable non-required destination, with the maximum\nnumber of blockable destinations for a device being 11. We further analyze the\ndestination of network traffic and find that all third parties observed in our\nexperi- ments are blockable, while first and support parties are neither\nuniformly required or non-required. Finally, we demonstrate the limitations of\nexisting blocklists on IoT traffic, propose a set of guidelines for\nautomatically limiting non-essential IoT traffic, and we develop a prototype\nsystem that implements these guidelines.",

In this paper, we present Pronunciation Teacher (PTeacher), a\nComputer-Aided Pronunciation Training (CAPT) system that provides personalized\nexaggerated audio-visual corrective feedback for mispronunciations. Though the\neffectiveness of exaggerated feedback has been demonstrated, it is still\nunclear how to define the appropriate degrees of exaggeration when interacting\nwith individual learners.To fill in this gap, we interview {100 L2 English\nlearners and 22 professional native teachers} to understand their needs and\nexperiences. Three critical metrics are proposed for both learners and teachers\nto identify the best exaggeration levels in both audio and visual modalities.\nAdditionally, we incorporate the personalized dynamic feedback mechanism given\nthe English proficiency of learners. Based on the obtained insights, a\ncomprehensive interactive pronunciation training course is designed to help L2\nlearners rectify mispronunciations in a more perceptible, understandable, and\ndiscriminative manner. Extensive user studies demonstrate that our system\nsignificantly promotes the learners' learning efficiency.",

This lends a way to\nstudy large-width neural networks via analyzing the mean field limit. Recent\nworks have successfully applied such analysis to two-layer networks and\nprovided global convergence guarantees. The extension to multilayer ones\nhowever has been a highly challenging puzzle, and little is known about the\noptimization efficiency in the mean field regime when there are more than two\nlayers.\nIn this work, we prove a global convergence result for unregularized\nfeedforward three-layer networks in the mean field regime. We first develop a\nrigorous framework to establish the mean field limit of three-layer networks\nunder stochastic gradient descent training. To that end, we propose the idea of\na \\textit{neuronal embedding}, which comprises of a fixed probability space\nthat encapsulates neural networks of arbitrary sizes. The identified mean field\nlimit is then used to prove a global convergence guarantee under suitable\nregularity and convergence mode assumptions, which -- unlike previous works on\ntwo-layer networks -- does not rely critically on convexity.

    "abstract": "User dissatisfaction due to buffering pauses during streaming is a\nsignificant cost to the system, which we model as a non-decreasing function of\nthe frequency of buffering pause. Minimization of total user dissatisfaction in\na multi-channel cellular network leads to a non-convex problem. Utilizing a\ncombinatorial structure in this problem, we first propose a polynomial time\njoint admission control and channel allocation algorithm which is provably\n(almost) optimal. This scheme assumes that the base station (BS) knows the\nframe statistics of the streams. In a more practical setting, where these\nstatistics are not available a priori at the BS, a learning based scheme with\nprovable guarantees is developed. This learning based scheme has relation to\nregret minimization in multi-armed bandits with non-i.i.d. and delayed reward\n(cost). All these algorithms require none to minimal feedback from the user\nequipment to the base station regarding the states of the media player buffer\nat the application layer, and hence, are of practical interest.",

NFV decouples network\nfunctions from specialized hardware devices and virtualizes these network\nfunctions as software instances called virtualized network functions (VNFs).\nNFV leads to various benefits, including more flexibility, high resource\nutilization, and easy upgrades and maintenances. Despite recent works in this\nfield, placement and chaining of VNFs need more attention. More specifically,\nsome of the existing works have considered only the placement of VNFs and\nignored the chaining part. So, they have not provided an integrated view of\nhost or bandwidth resources and propagation delay of paths. In this paper, we\nsolve the VNF placement and chaining problem as an optimization problem based\non the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Our goal is to minimize the\nrequired number of used servers, the average propagation delay of paths, and\nthe average utilization of links while meeting network demands and constraints.\nBased on the obtained results, the algorithm proposed in this study can find\nfeasible and high-quality solutions.",

Many methods approximate\nnumerical-valued statistics that represent only limited information of the\nQoIs. In this paper, we introduce a semi-parametric approach that aims to\neffectively describe the distribution of a scalar-valued QoI in the\nmultifidelity setup. Under a linear model hypothesis, we propose an\nexploration-exploitation strategy to reconstruct the full distribution of a\nscalar-valued QoI using samples from a subset of low-fidelity regressors. We\nderive an informative asymptotic bound for the mean 1-Wasserstein distance\nbetween the estimator and the true distribution, and use it to adaptively\nallocate computational budget for parametric estimation and non-parametric\nreconstruction. Assuming the linear model is correct, we prove that such a\nprocedure is consistent, and converges to the optimal policy (and hence optimal\ncomputational budget allocation) under an upper bound criterion as the budget\ngoes to infinity. A major advantage of our approach compared to several other\nmultifidelity methods is that it is automatic, and its implementation does not\nrequire a hierarchical model setup, cross-model information, or \\textit{a\npriori} known model statistics.

    "abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a type of brain disease which causes visual,\nsensory, and motor problems for people with a detrimental effect on the\nfunctioning of the nervous system. In order to diagnose MS, multiple screening\nmethods have been proposed so far; among them, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nhas received considerable attention among physicians. MRI modalities provide\nphysicians with fundamental information about the structure and function of the\nbrain, which is crucial for the rapid diagnosis of MS lesions. Diagnosing MS\nusing MRI is time-consuming, tedious, and prone to manual errors. Hence,\ncomputer aided diagnosis systems (CADS) based on artificial intelligence (AI)\nmethods have been proposed in recent years for accurate diagnosis of MS using\nMRI neuroimaging modalities. In the AI field, automated MS diagnosis is being\nconducted using (i) conventional machine learning and (ii) deep learning (DL)\ntechniques. The conventional machine learning approach is based on feature\nextraction and selection by trial and error. In DL, these steps are performed\nby the DL model itself. In this paper, a complete review of automated MS\ndiagnosis methods performed using DL techniques with MRI neuroimaging\nmodalities are discussed. Also, each work is thoroughly reviewed and discussed.\nFinally, the most important challenges and future directions in the automated\nMS diagnosis using DL techniques coupled with MRI modalities are presented in\ndetail.",

    "abstract": "Conditional selective inference (SI) has been studied intensively as a new\nstatistical inference framework for data-driven hypotheses. The basic concept\nof conditional SI is to make the inference conditional on the selection event,\nwhich enables an exact and valid statistical inference to be conducted even\nwhen the hypothesis is selected based on the data. Conditional SI has mainly\nbeen studied in the context of model selection, such as vanilla lasso or\ngeneralized lasso. The main limitation of existing approaches is the low\nstatistical power owing to over-conditioning, which is required for\ncomputational tractability. In this study, we propose a more powerful and\ngeneral conditional SI method for a class of problems that can be converted\ninto quadratic parametric programming, which includes generalized lasso. The\nkey concept is to compute the continuum path of the optimal solution in the\ndirection of the selected test statistic and to identify the subset of the data\nspace that corresponds to the model selection event by following the solution\npath. The proposed parametric programming-based method not only avoids the\naforementioned major drawback of over-conditioning, but also improves the\nperformance and practicality of SI in various respects.

    "abstract": "Performing reliability analysis on complex systems is often computationally\nexpensive. In particular, when dealing with systems having high input\ndimensionality, reliability estimation becomes a daunting task. A popular\napproach to overcome the problem associated with time-consuming and expensive\nevaluations is building a surrogate model. However, these computationally\nefficient models often suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Hence, training\na surrogate model for high-dimensional problems is not straightforward.\nHenceforth, this paper presents a framework for solving high-dimensional\nreliability analysis problems. The basic premise is to train the surrogate\nmodel on a low-dimensional manifold, discovered using the active subspace\nalgorithm. However, learning the low-dimensional manifold using active subspace\nis non-trivial as it requires information on the gradient of the response\nvariable. To address this issue, we propose using sparse learning algorithms in\nconjunction with the active subspace algorithm; the resulting algorithm is\nreferred to as the sparse active subspace (SAS) algorithm. We project the\nhigh-dimensional inputs onto the identified low-dimensional manifold identified\nusing SAS. A high-fidelity surrogate model is used to map the inputs on the\nlow-dimensional manifolds to the output response. We illustrate the efficacy of\nthe proposed framework by using three benchmark reliability analysis problems\nfrom the literature. The results obtained indicate the accuracy and efficiency\nof the proposed approach compared to already established reliability analysis\nmethods in the literature.",

    "abstract": "The autoencoder model uses an encoder to map data samples to a lower\ndimensional latent space and then a decoder to map the latent space\nrepresentations back to the data space. Implicitly, it relies on the encoder to\napproximate the inverse of the decoder network, so that samples can be mapped\nto and back from the latent space faithfully. This approximation may lead to\nsub-optimal latent space representations. In this work, we investigate a\ndecoder-only method that uses gradient flow to encode data samples in the\nlatent space. The gradient flow is defined based on a given decoder and aims to\nfind the optimal latent space representation for any given sample through\noptimisation, eliminating the need of an approximate inversion through an\nencoder. Implementing gradient flow through ordinary differential equations\n(ODE), we leverage the adjoint method to train a given decoder. We further show\nempirically that the costly integrals in the adjoint method may not be entirely\nnecessary. Additionally, we propose a $2^{nd}$ order ODE variant to the method,\nwhich approximates Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent, with faster\nconvergence per iteration. Commonly used ODE solvers can be quite sensitive to\nthe integration step-size depending on the stiffness of the ODE. To overcome\nthe sensitivity for gradient flow encoding, we use an adaptive solver that\nprioritises minimising loss at each integration step. We assess the proposed\nmethod in comparison to the autoencoding model.

With an objective to minimize the\nAirComp distortion, we propose a joint design of AirComp transceivers and RIS\nphase-shifts, which however turns out to be a highly intractable non-convex\nprogramming problem. To this end, we develop a novel alternating minimization\nframework in conjunction with the successive convex approximation technique,\nwhich is proved to converge monotonically. To reduce the computational\ncomplexity, we transform the subproblem in each alternation as a smooth\nconvex-concave saddle point problem, which is then tackled by proposing a\nMirror-Prox method that only involves a sequence of closed-form updates.\nSimulations show that the computation time of the proposed algorithm can be two\norders of magnitude smaller than that of the state-of-the-art algorithms, while\nachieving a similar distortion performance.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Protein-ligand affinity prediction is an important part of\nstructure-based drug design. It includes molecular docking and affinity\nprediction. Although molecular dynamics can predict affinity with high accuracy\nat present, it is not suitable for large-scale virtual screening. The existing\naffinity prediction and evaluation functions based on deep learning mostly rely\non experimentally-determined conformations. Results: We build a predictive\nmodel of protein-ligand affinity through the ResNet neural network with added\nattention mechanism. The resulting ResAtom-Score model achieves Pearson's\ncorrelation coefficient R = 0.833 on the CASF-2016 benchmark test set. At the\nsame time, we evaluated the performance of a variety of existing scoring\nfunctions in combination with ResAtom-Score in the absence of\nexperimentally-determined conformations. The results show that the use of\n{\\Delta}VinaRF20 in combination with ResAtom-Score can achieve affinity\nprediction close to scoring functions in the presence of\nexperimentally-determined conformations. These results suggest that ResAtom\nsystem may be used for in silico screening of small molecule ligands with\ntarget proteins in the future. Availability: https://github.com/wyji001/ResAtom",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death and require a spectrum\nof diagnostic procedures as well as invasive interventions. Medical imaging is\na vital part of the healthcare system, facilitating both diagnosis and guidance\nfor intervention. Intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography are\nwidely available for characterizing coronary stenoses and provide critical\nvessel parameters to optimize percutaneous intervention. Intravascular\npolarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) can simultaneously\nprovide high-resolution cross-sectional images of vascular structures while\nalso revealing preponderant tissue components such as collagen and smooth\nmuscle and thereby enhance plaque characterization. Automated interpretation of\nthese features would facilitate the objective clinical investigation of the\nnatural history and significance of coronary atheromas. Here, we propose a\nconvolutional neural network model and optimize its performance using a new\nmulti-term loss function to classify the lumen, intima, and media layers in\naddition to the guidewire and plaque artifacts. Our multi-class classification\nmodel outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in detecting the anatomical\nlayers based on accuracy, Dice coefficient, and average boundary error.\nFurthermore, the proposed model segments two classes of major artifacts and\ndetects the anatomical layers within the thickened vessel wall regions, which\nwere excluded from analysis by other studies.

    "abstract": "Uplift is a particular case of conditional treatment effect modeling. Such\nmodels deal with cause-and-effect inference for a specific factor, such as a\nmarketing intervention or a medical treatment. In practice, these models are\nbuilt on individual data from randomized clinical trials where the goal is to\npartition the participants into heterogeneous groups depending on the uplift.\nMost existing approaches are adaptations of random forests for the uplift case.\nSeveral split criteria have been proposed in the literature, all relying on\nmaximizing heterogeneity. However, in practice, these approaches are prone to\noverfitting. In this work, we bring a new vision to uplift modeling. We propose\na new loss function defined by leveraging a connection with the Bayesian\ninterpretation of the relative risk. Our solution is developed for a specific\ntwin neural network architecture allowing to jointly optimize the marginal\nprobabilities of success for treated and control individuals. We show that this\nmodel is a generalization of the uplift logistic interaction model. We modify\nthe stochastic gradient descent algorithm to allow for structured sparse\nsolutions.

While the flow properties of these\nmicrofluidic devices can be solved by numerical methods such as computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD), the process of mesh generation and setting up a numerical\nsolver requires some domain familiarity, while more intuitive commercial\nprograms such as Fluent and StarCCM can be expensive. Hence, in this work, we\ndemonstrated the use of a U-Net convolutional neural network as a surrogate\nmodel for predicting the velocity and pressure fields that would result for a\nparticular set of microfluidic filter designs. The surrogate model is fast,\neasy to set-up and can be used to predict and assess the flow velocity and\npressure fields across the domain for new designs of interest via the input of\na geometry-encoding matrix. In addition, we demonstrate that the same\nmethodology can also be used to train a network to predict pressure based on\nvelocity data, and propose that this can be an alternative to numerical\nalgorithms for calculating pressure based on velocity measurements from\nparticle-image velocimetry measurements. Critically, in both applications, we\ndemonstrate prediction test errors of less than 1%, suggesting that this is\nindeed a viable method.",

    "abstract": "Automated lobar segmentation allows regional evaluation of lung disease and\nis important for diagnosis and therapy planning. Advanced statistical workflows\npermitting such evaluation is a needed area within respiratory medicine; their\nadoption remains slow, with poor workflow accuracy. Diseased lung regions often\nproduce high-density zones on CT images, limiting an algorithm's execution to\nspecify damaged lobes due to oblique or lacking fissures. This impact motivated\ndeveloping an improved machine learning method to segment lung lobes that\nutilises tracheobronchial tree information to enhance segmentation accuracy\nthrough the algorithm's spatial familiarity to define lobar extent more\naccurately. The method undertakes parallel segmentation of lobes and auxiliary\ntissues simultaneously by employing multi-task learning (MTL) in conjunction\nwith V-Net-attention, a popular convolutional neural network in the imaging\nrealm. In keeping with the model's adeptness for better generalisation, high\nperformance was retained in an external dataset of patients with four distinct\ndiseases: severe lung cancer, COVID-19 pneumonitis, collapsed lungs and Chronic\nObstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), even though the training data included\nnone of these cases. The benefit of our external validation test is\nspecifically relevant since our choice includes those patients who have\ndiagnosed lung disease with associated radiological abnormalities. To ensure\nequal rank is given to all segmentations in the main task we report the\nfollowing performance (Dice score) on a per-segment basis: normal lungs 0.97,\nCOPD 0.94, lung cancer 0.94, COVID-19 pneumonitis 0.94 and collapsed lung 0.92,\nall at p<0.05. Even segmenting lobes with large deformations on CT images, the\nmodel maintained high accuracy. The approach can be readily adopted in the\nclinical setting as a robust tool for radiologists.",

Using this\nspectral representation of power systems, we identify the crucial graph\nsub-structure that ensures line failure localization -- the network\nbridge-block decomposition. Leveraging this theory, we propose an adaptive\nnetwork topology reconfiguration paradigm that uses a two-stage algorithm where\nthe first stage aims to identify optimal clusters using the notion of network\nmodularity and the second stage refines the clusters by means of optimal line\nswitching actions.
