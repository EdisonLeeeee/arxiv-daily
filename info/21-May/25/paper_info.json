    "title": "Feature Encoding with AutoEncoders for Weakly-supervised Anomaly  Detection",
    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised anomaly detection aims at learning an anomaly detector from\na limited amount of labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. Recent works\nbuild deep neural networks for anomaly detection by discriminatively mapping\nthe normal samples and abnormal samples to different regions in the feature\nspace or fitting different distributions. However, due to the limited number of\nannotated anomaly samples, directly training networks with the discriminative\nloss may not be sufficient. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel\nstrategy to transform the input data into a more meaningful representation that\ncould be used for anomaly detection. Specifically, we leverage an autoencoder\nto encode the input data and utilize three factors, hidden representation,\nreconstruction residual vector, and reconstruction error, as the new\nrepresentation for the input data. This representation amounts to encode a test\nsample with its projection on the training data manifold, its direction to its\nprojection and its distance to its projection. In addition to this encoding, we\nalso propose a novel network architecture to seamlessly incorporate those three\nfactors. From our extensive experiments, the benefits of the proposed strategy\nare clearly demonstrated by its superior performance over the competitive\nmethods.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the transmit power optimization in multi-cell massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Network-wide max-min fairness\n(NW-MMF) and network-wide proportional fairness (NW-PF) are two well-known\npower control schemes in the literature. The NW-MMF focus on maximizing the\nfairness among users at the cost of penalizing users with good channel\nconditions. On the other hand, the NW-PF focuses on maximizing the sum SE,\nthereby ignoring fairness, but gives some extra attention to the weakest users.\nHowever, both of these schemes suffer from a scalability issue which means that\nfor large networks, it is highly probable that one user has a very poor channel\ncondition, pushing the spectral efficiency (SE) of all users towards zero. To\novercome the scalability issue of NW-MMF and NW-PF, we propose a novel power\ncontrol scheme that is provably scalable. This scheme maximizes the geometric\nmean (GM) of the per-cell max-min SE. To solve this new optimization problem,\nwe prove that it can be rewritten in a convex optimization form and then solved\nusing standard tools. The simulation results highlight the benefits of our\nmodel which is balancing between NW-PF and NW-MMF.",

    "abstract": "Searching for a more compact network width recently serves as an effective\nway of channel pruning for the deployment of convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) under hardware constraints. To fulfill the searching, a one-shot\nsupernet is usually leveraged to efficiently evaluate the performance\n\\wrt~different network widths. However, current methods mainly follow a\n\\textit{unilaterally augmented} (UA) principle for the evaluation of each\nwidth, which induces the training unfairness of channels in supernet. In this\npaper, we introduce a new supernet called Bilaterally Coupled Network (BCNet)\nto address this issue. In BCNet, each channel is fairly trained and responsible\nfor the same amount of network widths, thus each network width can be evaluated\nmore accurately. Besides, we leverage a stochastic complementary strategy for\ntraining the BCNet, and propose a prior initial population sampling method to\nboost the performance of the evolutionary search. Extensive experiments on\nbenchmark CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets indicate that our method can achieve\nstate-of-the-art or competing performance over other baseline methods.\nMoreover, our method turns out to further boost the performance of NAS models\nby refining their network widths.

We show that the new\nanalog computing techniques like Coherent Ising Machines (CIM) and\nOscillator-based Ising Machines (OIM) are promising candidates for performing\nnear-optimal MIMO detection. We illustrate a fundamental problem with using\nclassical, optical or quantum mechanical Ising Machines for MIMO detection: the\nerror floor problem, which is a major bottleneck to practical deployments of\nIsing machine-based MIMO detectors. We propose a novel regularized Ising\nformulation for MIMO detection that mitigates the error floor and further\nevolves it into an algorithm that achieves near-optimal MIMO detection. Massive\nMIMO systems, that have a much larger number of antennas at the Access point\n(AP) than at the users, allow linear detectors to be near-optimal. However, the\nsimplified detection in these systems comes at the cost of overall throughput,\nwhich can be improved by supporting more users. We show that our methods allow\nus to add more transmitter antennas/users and increase the overall throughput\nof the cell by several folds. We further show that our methods allow us to\noperate using more aggressive modulation and coding schemes and hence achieve\nmuch higher throughput. We demonstrate that, for a $16\\times16$ large MIMO\nsystem, our methods achieve around 2.5$\\times$ more throughput in mid-SNR\nregime ($\\approx 12 dB$) and 2$\\times$ more throughput in high-SNR regime( $>$\n20dB) than MMSE.",

In this paper, we present a new numerical method that\nuses the concept of \\emph{enriched stochastic flow maps} to track the evolution\nof the stochastic part of the solution space in time. The computational cost of\nthis proposed flow-driven stochastic chaos (FSC) method is an order of\nmagnitude lower than TD-gPC for comparable solution accuracy. This gain in\ncomputational cost is realized because, unlike most existing methods, the\nnumber of basis vectors required to track the stochastic part of the solution\nspace, and consequently the computational cost associated with the solution of\nthe resulting system of equations, does not depend upon the dimensionality of\nthe probability space.

The cause\nof this perhaps unintuitive outcome is that today's buffer sharing techniques\nare unable to guarantee isolation across (priority) queues without statically\nallocating buffer space.

However,\nanecdotal and survey evidence show that ordinary people feel discontent and\neven anger regarding data collection practices that are currently typical and\nlegal. This suggests that personal data markets in their current form do not\nadhere to the norms applied by ordinary people. The present study\nexperimentally probes whether market transactions in a typical online scenario\nare accepted when evaluated by lay people. The results show that a high\npercentage of study participants refused to participate in a data pricing\nexercise, even in a commercial context where market rules would typically be\nexpected to apply. For those participants who did price the data, the median\nprice was an order of magnitude higher than the market price. These results\ncall into question the notice and consent market paradigm that is used by\ntechnology firms and government regulators when evaluating data flows. The\nresults also point to a conceptual mismatch between cultural and legal\nexpectations regarding the use of personal data.",

    "abstract": "Learning to count is an important example of the broader human capacity for\nsystematic generalization, and the development of counting is often\ncharacterized by an inflection point when children rapidly acquire proficiency\nwith the procedures that support this ability. We aimed to model this process\nby training a reinforcement learning agent to select N items from a binary\nvector when instructed (known as the give-$N$ task). We found that a\nmemory-augmented modular network architecture based on the recently proposed\nEmergent Symbol Binding Network (ESBN) exhibited an inflection during learning\nthat resembled human development. This model was also capable of systematic\nextrapolation outside the range of its training set - for example, trained only\nto select between 1 and 10 items, it could succeed at selecting 11 to 15 items\nas long as it could make use of an arbitrary count sequence of at least that\nlength. The close parallels to child development and the capacity for\nextrapolation suggest that our model could shed light on the emergence of\nsystematicity in humans.",

For networks with an architecure\nsimilar to VGG, the after kernel is more \"global\", in the sense that it is less\ninvariant to transformations of input images that disrupt the global structure\nof the image while leaving the local statistics largely intact. For fully\nconnected networks, the after kernel is less global in this sense. The after\nkernel tends to be more invariant to small shifts, rotations and zooms; data\naugmentation does not improve these invariances.

UAVs can be gainfully employed to\ncontinually visit a set of targets representing tasks (and locations) in the\nenvironment and collect data therein for long time periods. The enduring nature\nof these missions requires the UAV to be regularly recharged at a service\nstation. In this paper, we consider the case in which the service station is\nnot co-located with any of the targets. An efficient monitoring requires the\nrevisit time, defined as the maximum of the time elapsed between successive\nrevisits to targets, to be minimized. Here, we consider the problem of\ndetermining UAV routes that lead to the minimum revisit time. The problem is\nNP-hard, and its computational difficulty increases with the fuel capacity of\nthe UAV. We develop an algorithm to construct near-optimal solutions to the\nproblem quickly, when the fuel capacity exceeds a threshold. We also develop\nlower bounds to the optimal revisit time and use these bounds to demonstrate\n(through numerical simulations) that the constructed solutions are, on an\naverage, at most 0.01% away from the optimum.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is an effective technique for training\ndecision-making agents through interactions with their environment. The advent\nof deep learning has been associated with highly notable successes with\nsequential decision making problems - such as defeating some of the\nhighest-ranked human players at Go. In digital advertising, real-time bidding\n(RTB) is a common method of allocating advertising inventory through real-time\nauctions. Bidding strategies need to incorporate logic for dynamically\nadjusting parameters in order to deliver pre-assigned campaign goals. Here we\ndiscuss techniques toward using RL to train bidding agents. As a campaign\nmetric we particularly focused on viewability: the percentage of inventory\nwhich goes on to be viewed by an end user.\nThis paper is presented as a survey of techniques and experiments which we\ndeveloped through the course of this research. We discuss expanding our\ntraining data to include edge cases by training on simulated interactions. We\ndiscuss the experimental results comparing the performance of several promising\nRL algorithms, and an approach to hyperparameter optimization of an\nactor/critic training pipeline through Bayesian optimization. Finally, we\npresent live-traffic tests of some of our RL agents against a rule-based\nfeedback-control approach, demonstrating the potential for this method as well\nas areas for further improvement. This paper therefore presents an arrangement\nof our findings in this quickly developing field, and ways that it can be\napplied to an RTB use case.",

    "abstract": "We consider the fundamental problems of size discovery and topology\nrecognition in radio networks modeled by simple undirected connected graphs.\nSize discovery calls for all nodes to output the number of nodes in the graph,\ncalled its size, and in the task of topology recognition each node has to learn\nthe topology of the graph and its position in it. In radio networks, nodes\ncommunicate in synchronous rounds and start in the same round. In each round a\nnode can either transmit the same message to all its neighbors, or stay silent\nand listen. At the receiving end, a node $v$ hears a message from a neighbor\n$w$ in a given round, if $v$ listens in this round, and if $w$ is its only\nneighbor that transmits in this round. If more than one neighbor of a node $v$\ntransmits in a given round, there is a collision at $v$. We do not assume\ncollision detection: in case of a collision, node $v$ does not hear anything.\nThe time of a deterministic algorithm for each of the above problems is the\nworst-case number of rounds it takes to solve it.\nOur goal is to construct short labeling schemes for size discovery and\ntopology recognition in arbitrary radio networks, and to design efficient\ndeterministic algorithms using these schemes. For size discovery, we construct\na labeling scheme of length $O(\\log\\log\\Delta)$ and we design an algorithm for\nthis problem using this scheme and working in time $O(\\log^2 n)$, where $n$ is\nthe size of the graph. We also show that time complexity $O(\\log^2 n)$ is\noptimal for the problem of size discovery, whenever the labeling scheme is of\noptimal length. For topology recognition, we construct a labeling scheme of\nlength $O(\\log\\Delta)$, and we design an algorithm for this problem using this\nscheme working in time $O\\left(D\\Delta+\\min(\\Delta^2,n)\\right)$.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces HPNet, a novel deep-learning approach for segmenting a\n3D shape represented as a point cloud into primitive patches. The key to deep\nprimitive segmentation is learning a feature representation that can separate\npoints of different primitives. Unlike utilizing a single feature\nrepresentation, HPNet leverages hybrid representations that combine one learned\nsemantic descriptor, two spectral descriptors derived from predicted geometric\nparameters, as well as an adjacency matrix that encodes sharp edges.

    "title": "Support Optimality and Adaptive Cuckoo Filters",
    "abstract": "Filters (such as Bloom Filters) are data structures that speed up network\nrouting and measurement operations by storing a compressed representation of a\nset. Filters are space efficient, but can make bounded one-sided errors: with\ntunable probability epsilon, they may report that a query element is stored in\nthe filter when it is not. This is called a false positive. Recent research has\nfocused on designing methods for dynamically adapting filters to false\npositives, reducing the number of false positives when some elements are\nqueried repeatedly.\nIdeally, an adaptive filter would incur a false positive with bounded\nprobability epsilon for each new query element, and would incur o(epsilon)\ntotal false positives over all repeated queries to that element. We call such a\nfilter support optimal.\nIn this paper we design a new Adaptive Cuckoo Filter and show that it is\nsupport optimal (up to additive logarithmic terms) over any n queries when\nstoring a set of size n. Our filter is simple: fixing previous false positives\nrequires a simple cuckoo operation, and the filter does not need to store any\nadditional metadata. This data structure is the first practical data structure\nthat is support optimal, and the first filter that does not require additional\nspace to fix false positives.\nWe complement these bounds with experiments showing that our data structure\nis effective at fixing false positives on network traces, outperforming\nprevious Adaptive Cuckoo Filters.\nFinally, we investigate adversarial adaptivity, a stronger notion of\nadaptivity in which an adaptive adversary repeatedly queries the filter, using\nthe result of previous queries to drive the false positive rate as high as\npossible. We prove a lower bound showing that a broad family of filters,\nincluding all known Adaptive Cuckoo Filters, can be forced by such an adversary\nto incur a large number of false positives.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has considered natural variations of the multi-armed bandit\nproblem, where the reward distribution of each arm is a special function of the\ntime passed since its last pulling. In this direction, a simple (yet widely\napplicable) model is that of blocking bandits, where an arm becomes unavailable\nfor a deterministic number of rounds after each play. In this work, we extend\nthe above model in two directions: (i) We consider the general combinatorial\nsetting where more than one arms can be played at each round, subject to\nfeasibility constraints. (ii) We allow the blocking time of each arm to be\nstochastic. We first study the computational/unconditional hardness of the\nabove setting and identify the necessary conditions for the problem to become\ntractable (even in an approximate sense). Based on these conditions, we provide\na tight analysis of the approximation guarantee of a natural greedy heuristic\nthat always plays the maximum expected reward feasible subset among the\navailable (non-blocked) arms. When the arms' expected rewards are unknown, we\nadapt the above heuristic into a bandit algorithm, based on UCB, for which we\nprovide sublinear (approximate) regret guarantees, matching the theoretical\nlower bounds in the limiting case of absence of delays.",

    "title": "Searching Collaborative Agents for Multi-plane Localization in 3D  Ultrasound",
    "abstract": "3D ultrasound (US) has become prevalent due to its rich spatial and\ndiagnostic information not contained in 2D US. Moreover, 3D US can contain\nmultiple standard planes (SPs) in one shot. Thus, automatically localizing SPs\nin 3D US has the potential to improve user-independence and\nscanning-efficiency. However, manual SP localization in 3D US is challenging\nbecause of the low image quality, huge search space and large anatomical\nvariability. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) framework to simultaneously localize multiple SPs in 3D US. Our\ncontribution is four-fold. First, our proposed method is general and it can\naccurately localize multiple SPs in different challenging US datasets. Second,\nwe equip the MARL system with a recurrent neural network (RNN) based\ncollaborative module, which can strengthen the communication among agents and\nlearn the spatial relationship among planes effectively. Third, we explore to\nadopt the neural architecture search (NAS) to automatically design the network\narchitecture of both the agents and the collaborative module. Last, we believe\nwe are the first to realize automatic SP localization in pelvic US volumes, and\nnote that our approach can handle both normal and abnormal uterus cases.\nExtensively validated on two challenging datasets of the uterus and fetal\nbrain, our proposed method achieves the average localization accuracy of 7.03\ndegrees/1.59mm and 9.75 degrees/1.19mm. Experimental results show that our\nlight-weight MARL model has higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.",

It was recently shown that contractions, a key concept from graph\ntheory, in the system graph are critical to system observability, as (at least)\none state measurement in every contraction is necessary for observability.\nThus, the size and number of contractions are critical in recovering for loss\nof observability.

Various tasks for classifying new\nspecies from image data can be modeled as a semi-supervised few-shot\nclassification, which assumes a labeled and unlabeled training examples and a\nsmall support set of the target classes. Predicting target classes with a few\nsupport examples per class makes the learning task difficult for existing\nsemi-supervised classification methods, including selftraining, which\niteratively estimates class labels of unlabeled training examples to learn a\nclassifier for the training classes. To exploit unlabeled training examples\neffectively, we adopt as the objective function the composite likelihood, which\nintegrates discriminative and generative learning and suits better with deep\nneural networks than the parameter coupling prior, the other popular integrated\nlearning approach.

The model learned\nfrom historical interactions with imbalanced item distribution will amplify the\nimbalance by over-recommending items from the major groups. Addressing this\nissue is essential for a healthy ecosystem of recommendation in the long run.\nExisting works apply bias control to the ranking targets (e.g., calibration,\nfairness, and diversity), but ignore the true reason for bias amplification and\ntrade-off the recommendation accuracy.\nIn this work, we scrutinize the cause-effect factors for bias amplification,\nidentifying the main reason lies in the confounder effect of imbalanced item\ndistribution on user representation and prediction score. The existence of such\nconfounder pushes us to go beyond merely modeling the conditional probability\nand embrace the causal modeling for recommendation. Towards this end, we\npropose a Deconfounded Recommender System (DecRS), which models the causal\neffect of user representation on the prediction score. The key to eliminating\nthe impact of the confounder lies in backdoor adjustment, which is however\ndifficult to do due to the infinite sample space of the confounder. For this\nchallenge, we contribute an approximation operator for backdoor adjustment\nwhich can be easily plugged into most recommender models. Lastly, we devise an\ninference strategy to dynamically regulate backdoor adjustment according to\nuser status.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a privacy filter design problem for a sequence of\nsensor measurements whose joint probability density function (p.d.f.) depends\non a private parameter. To ensure parameter privacy, we propose a filter design\nframework which consists of two components: a randomizer and a nonlinear\ntransformation. The randomizer takes the private parameter as input and\nrandomly generates a pseudo parameter. The nonlinear mapping transforms the\nmeasurements such that the joint p.d.f. of the filter's output depends on the\npseudo parameter rather than the private parameter. It also ensures that the\njoint p.d.f. of the filter's output belongs to the same family of distributions\nas that of the measurements. The nonlinear transformation has a\nfeedforward-feedback structure that allows real-time and causal generation of\nthe disguised measurements with low complexity using a recursive structure. The\ndesign of the randomizer is formulated as an optimization problem subject to a\nprivacy constraint, in terms of mutual information, and it is shown that the\noptimal randomizer is the solution of a convex optimization problem. Using\ninformation-theoretic inequalities, we show that the performance of any\nestimator of the private parameter, based on the output of the privacy filter,\nis limited by the privacy constraint. The structure of the nonlinear\ntransformation is studied in the special cases of independent and identically\ndistributed, Markovian, and Gauss-Markov measurements. Our results show that\nthe privacy filter in the Gauss-Markov case can be implemented as two one-step\nahead Kalman predictors and a set of minimum mean square error predictors.

    "title": "Runtime Enforcement of Programmable Logic Controllers",
    "abstract": "With the advent of Industry 4.0, industrial facilities and critical\ninfrastructures are transforming into an ecosystem of heterogeneous physical\nand cyber components, such as programmable logic controllers, increasingly\ninterconnected and therefore exposed to cyber-physical attacks, i.e., security\nbreaches in cyberspace that may adversely affect the physical processes\nunderlying industrial control systems. In this paper, we propose a formal\napproach} based on runtime enforcement to ensure specification compliance in\nnetworks of controllers, possibly compromised by colluding malware that may\ntamper with actuator commands, sensor readings, and inter-controller\ncommunications. Our approach relies on an ad-hoc sub-class of Ligatti et al.'s\nedit automata to enforce controllers represented in Hennessy and Regan's Timed\nProcess Language. We define a synthesis algorithm that, given an alphabet $P$\nof observable actions and a regular timed correctness property $e$, returns a\nmonitor that enforces the property $e$ during the execution of any (potentially\ncorrupted) controller with alphabet $P$, and complying with the property $e$.\nOur monitors correct and suppress incorrect actions coming from corrupted\ncontrollers and emit actions in full autonomy when the controller under\nscrutiny is not able to do so in a correct manner. Besides classical\nrequirements, such as transparency and soundness, the proposed enforcement\nenjoys deadlock- and diverge-freedom of monitored controllers, together with\nscalability when dealing with networks of controllers. Finally, we test the\nproposed enforcement mechanism on a non-trivial case study, taken from the\ncontext of industrial water treatment systems, in which the controllers are\ninjected with different malware with different malicious goals.",

However, the\non-chip implementation of a large-scale neural network is still challenging\nowing to its low scalability. Herein, we propose the concept of a photonic\nneural field and implement it experimentally on a silicon chip to realize\nhighly scalable neuro-inspired computing. In contrast to existing photonic\nneural networks, the photonic neural field is a spatially continuous field that\nnonlinearly responds to optical inputs, and its high spatial degrees of freedom\nallow for large-scale and high-density neural processing on a millimeter-scale\nchip. In this study, we use the on-chip photonic neural field as a reservoir of\ninformation and demonstrate a high-speed chaotic time-series prediction with\nlow errors using a training approach similar to reservoir computing. We discuss\nthat the photonic neural field is potentially capable of executing more than\none peta multiply-accumulate operations per second for a single input\nwavelength on a footprint as small as a few square millimeters. In addition to\nprocessing, the photonic neural field can be used for rapidly sensing the\ntemporal variation of an optical phase, facilitated by its high sensitivity to\noptical inputs.

    "abstract": "Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) aims at matching the video\ntracklets with cropped video frames for identifying the pedestrians under\ndifferent cameras. However, there exists severe spatial and temporal\nmisalignment for those cropped tracklets due to the imperfect detection and\ntracking results generated with obsolete methods. To address this issue, we\npresent a simple re-Detect and Link (DL) module which can effectively reduce\nthose unexpected noise through applying the deep learning-based detection and\ntracking on the cropped tracklets. Furthermore, we introduce an improved model\ncalled Coarse-to-Fine Axial-Attention Network (CF-AAN). Based on the typical\nNon-local Network, we replace the non-local module with three 1-D\nposition-sensitive axial attentions, in addition to our proposed coarse-to-fine\nstructure. With the developed CF-AAN, compared to the original non-local\noperation, we can not only significantly reduce the computation cost but also\nobtain the state-of-the-art performance (91.3% in rank-1 and 86.5% in mAP) on\nthe large-scale MARS dataset. Meanwhile, by simply adopting our DL module for\ndata alignment, to our surprise, several baseline models can achieve better or\ncomparable results with the current state-of-the-arts. Besides, we discover the\nerrors not only for the identity labels of tracklets but also for the\nevaluation protocol for the test data of MARS.

However, these legacy data ecosystems are now\nbreaking down under the pressure of the exponential growth in the volume and\nvelocity of these workflows, which are further complicated by the need to\nintegrate the highly data intensive methods of the Artificial Intelligence\nrevolution. Enabling ground breaking science that makes full use of this new,\ndata saturated research environment will require distributed systems that\nsupport dramatically improved resource sharing, workflow portability and\ncomposability, and data ecosystem convergence.\nThe Cybercosm vision presented in this white paper describes a radically\ndifferent approach to the architecture of distributed systems for\ndata-intensive science and its application workflows. As opposed to traditional\nmodels that restrict interoperability by hiving off storage, networking, and\ncomputing resources in separate technology silos, Cybercosm defines a minimally\nsufficient hypervisor as a spanning layer for its data plane that virtualizes\nand converges the local resources of the system's nodes in a fully\ninteroperable manner. By building on a common, universal interface into which\nthe problems that infect today's data-intensive workflows can be decomposed and\nattacked, Cybercosm aims to support scalable, portable and composable workflows\nthat span and merge the distributed data ecosystems that characterize leading\nedge research communities today.",

    "abstract": "The safety constraints commonly used by existing safe reinforcement learning\n(RL) methods are defined only on expectation of initial states, but allow each\ncertain state to be unsafe, which is unsatisfying for real-world\nsafety-critical tasks. In this paper, we introduce the feasible actor-critic\n(FAC) algorithm, which is the first model-free constrained RL method that\nconsiders statewise safety, e.g, safety for each initial state. We claim that\nsome states are inherently unsafe no matter what policy we choose, while for\nother states there exist policies ensuring safety, where we say such states and\npolicies are feasible. By constructing a statewise Lagrange function available\non RL sampling and adopting an additional neural network to approximate the\nstatewise Lagrange multiplier, we manage to obtain the optimal feasible policy\nwhich ensures safety for each feasible state and the safest possible policy for\ninfeasible states. Furthermore, the trained multiplier net can indicate whether\na given state is feasible or not through the statewise complementary slackness\ncondition. We provide theoretical guarantees that FAC outperforms previous\nexpectation-based constrained RL methods in terms of both constraint\nsatisfaction and reward optimization.

    "abstract": "Objective: To assess automatic computer-aided in-situ recognition of\nmorphological features of pure and mixed urinary stones using intraoperative\ndigital endoscopic images acquired in a clinical setting. Materials and\nmethods: In this single-centre study, an experienced urologist intraoperatively\nand prospectively examined the surface and section of all kidney stones\nencountered. Calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM/Ia), dihydrate (COD/IIb) and uric\nacid (UA/IIIb) morphological criteria were collected and classified to generate\nannotated datasets. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to\npredict the composition of both pure and mixed stones. To explain the\npredictions of the deep neural network model, coarse localisation heat-maps\nwere plotted to pinpoint key areas identified by the network. Results: This\nstudy included 347 and 236 observations of stone surface and stone section,\nrespectively. A highest sensitivity of 98 % was obtained for the type \"pure\nIIIb/UA\" using surface images. The most frequently encountered morphology was\nthat of the type \"pure Ia/COM\"; it was correctly predicted in 91 % and 94 % of\ncases using surface and section images, respectively. Of the mixed type\n\"Ia/COM+IIb/COD\", Ia/COM was predicted in 84 % of cases using surface images,\nIIb/COD in 70 % of cases, and both in 65 % of cases. Concerning mixed\nIa/COM+IIIb/UA stones, Ia/COM was predicted in 91 % of cases using section\nimages, IIIb/UA in 69 % of cases, and both in 74 % of cases. Conclusions: This\npreliminary study demonstrates that deep convolutional neural networks are\npromising to identify kidney stone composition from endoscopic images acquired\nintraoperatively. Both pure and mixed stone composition could be discriminated.\nCollected in a clinical setting, surface and section images analysed by deep\nCNN provide valuable information about stone morphology for computer-aided\ndiagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Achieving long-term autonomy for mobile robots operating in real-world\nunstructured environments such as farms remains a significant challenge. This\nis made increasingly complex in the presence of moving humans or livestock.\nThese environments require a robot to be adaptive in its immediate plans,\naccounting for the state of nearby individuals and the response that they might\nhave to the robot's actions. Additionally, in order to achieve longer-term\ngoals, consideration of the limited on-board resources available to the robot\nis required, especially for extended missions such as weeding an agricultural\nfield. To achieve efficient long-term autonomy, it is thus crucial to\nunderstand the impact that online dynamic updates to an energy efficient\noffline plan might have on resource usage whilst navigating through crowds or\nherds. To address these challenges, a hierarchical planning framework is\nproposed, integrating an online local dynamic path planner with an offline\nlonger-term objective-based planner. This framework acts to achieve long-term\nautonomy through awareness of both dynamic responses of individuals to a\nrobot's motion and the limited resources available. This paper details the\nhierarchical approach and its integration on a robotic platform, including a\ncomprehensive description of the planning framework and associated perception\nmodules. The approach is evaluated in real-world trials on farms, requiring\nboth consideration of limited battery capacity and the presence of nearby\nmoving individuals. These trials additionally demonstrate the ability of the\nframework to adapt resource use through variation of the local dynamic planner,\nallowing adaptive behaviour in changing environments.

This paper studies a fundamental problem of NoisyNNs: how to estimate\nthe uncontaminated NN weights from their noisy observations or manifestations.\nWhereas all prior works relied on the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation to\nmaximize the likelihood function of the estimated NN weights, this paper\ndemonstrates that the ML estimator is in general suboptimal. To overcome the\nsuboptimality of the conventional ML estimator, we put forth an\n$\\text{MMSE}_{pb}$ estimator to minimize a compensated mean squared error (MSE)\nwith a population compensator and a bias compensator. Our approach works well\nfor NoisyNNs arising in both 1) noisy inference, where noise is introduced only\nin the inference phase on the already-trained NN weights; and 2) noisy\ntraining, where noise is introduced over the course of training. Extensive\nexperiments on the CIFAR-10 and SST-2 datasets with different NN architectures\nverify the significant performance gains of the $\\text{MMSE}_{pb}$ estimator\nover the ML estimator when used to denoise the NoisyNN.

    "abstract": "For nonconvex and nonsmooth restoration models, the lower bound theory\nreveals their good edge recovery ability, and related analysis can help to\ndesign convergent algorithms. Existing such discussions are focused on\nisotropic regularization models, or only the lower bound theory of anisotropic\nmodel with a quadratic fidelity. In this paper, we consider a general image\nrecovery model with a non-Lipschitz anisotropic composite regularization term\nand an $\\ell_q$ norm ($1\\leq q<+\\infty$) data fidelity term. We establish the\nlower bound theory for the anisotropic model with an $\\ell_1$ fidelity, which\napplies to impulsive noise removal problems. For the general case with $1\\leq\nq<+\\infty$, a support inclusion analysis is provided. To solve this\nnon-Lipschitz composite minimization model, we are then motivated to introduce\na support shrinking strategy in the iterative algorithm and relax the support\nconstraint to a thresholding support constraint, which is more computationally\npractical. The objective function at each iteration is also linearized to\nconstruct a strongly convex subproblem. To make the algorithm more\nimplementable, we compute an approximation solution to this subproblem at each\niteration, but not exactly solve it. The global convergence result of the\nproposed inexact iterative thresholding and support shrinking algorithm with\nproximal linearization is established. The experiments on image restoration and\ntwo stage image segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithm.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the paucity of models of matching markets, both\none-sided and two-sided, when utility functions of agents are cardinal. The\nclassical Hylland-Zeckhauser scheme \\cite{hylland}, which is the most prominent\nsuch model in economics, can be viewed as corresponding to the linear Fisher\nmodel, which is most elementary model in market equilibria. Although HZ is\nbased on the attractive idea of using a pricing mechanism, from the viewpoint\nof use in applications, it has a serious drawback, namely lack of computational\nefficiency, due to which solving instances of size even 4 or 5 is difficult.\nWe propose a variety of Nash-bargaining-based models, several of which draw\nfrom general equilibrium theory, which has defined a rich collection of market\nmodels that generalize the linear Fisher model in order to address more\nspecialized and realistic situations. The Nash bargaining solution satisfies\nPareto optimality and symmetry and the allocations it yields are remarkably\nfair. Furthermore, since the solution is captured via a convex program, it is\npolynomial time computable. In order to be used in \"industrial grade\"\napplications, we give implementations for these models that are extremely time\nefficient, solving large instances, with $n = 2000$, in one hour on a PC, even\nfor a two-sided matching market.\nThe idea underlying our work has its origins in Vazirani (2012), which viewed\nthe linear case of the Arrow-Debreu market model as a Nash bargaining game and\ngave a combinatorial, polynomial time algorithm for finding allocations via\nthis solution concept, rather than the usual approach of using a pricing\nmechanism.",

    "abstract": "The threats faced by cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in critical infrastructure\nhave motivated research into a multitude of attack detection mechanisms,\nincluding anomaly detectors based on neural network models. The effectiveness\nof anomaly detectors can be assessed by subjecting them to test suites of\nattacks, but less consideration has been given to adversarial attackers that\ncraft noise specifically designed to deceive them. While successfully applied\nin domains such as images and audio, adversarial attacks are much harder to\nimplement in CPSs due to the presence of other built-in defence mechanisms such\nas rule checkers(or invariant checkers). In this work, we present an\nadversarial attack that simultaneously evades the anomaly detectors and rule\ncheckers of a CPS. Inspired by existing gradient-based approaches, our\nadversarial attack crafts noise over the sensor and actuator values, then uses\na genetic algorithm to optimise the latter, ensuring that the neural network\nand the rule checking system are both deceived.We implemented our approach for\ntwo real-world critical infrastructure testbeds, successfully reducing the\nclassification accuracy of their detectors by over 50% on average, while\nsimultaneously avoiding detection by rule checkers.

For several GNN variants, using\nreal-world datasets with substantial background knowledge, we show that BotGNNs\nperform significantly better than both GNNs without background knowledge and a\nrecently proposed simplified technique for including domain knowledge into\nGNNs.

However, due to the remote\nlocation of cloud servers, IoT devices often suffer from intermittent Wide Area\nNetwork (WAN) latency which makes execution of delay-critical IoT applications\ninconceivable. To overcome this, service providers (SPs) often deploy multiple\nfog nodes (FNs) at the network edge that helps in executing offloaded\ncomputations from IoT devices with improved user experience. As the FNs have\nlimited resources, matching IoT services to FNs while ensuring minimum latency\nand energy from an end-user's perspective and maximizing revenue and tasks\nmeeting deadlines from an SP's standpoint is challenging. Therefore in this\npaper, we propose a student project allocation (SPA) based efficient task\noffloading strategy called SPATO that takes into account key parameters from\ndifferent stakeholders. Thorough simulation analysis shows that SPATO is able\nto reduce the offloading energy and latency respectively by 29% and 40% and\nimproves the revenue by 25% with 99.3% of tasks executing within their\ndeadline.",

AC side switches are actively commutated\nto achieve zero current switching (ZCS) using single phase shift modulation\n(SPSM) and discontinuous current phase shift modulation (DCPSM). Furthermore,\nzero voltage turn-on (ZVS) is achieved for dc side switches. Compared to SPSM,\nDCPSM maintains a constant peak current in the converter throughout the grid\ncycle of ac mains voltage.

    "title": "A systematic review of physical-digital play technology and  developmentally relevant child behaviour",
    "abstract": "New interactive physical-digital play technologies are shaping the way\nchildren plan. These technologies refer to digital play technologies that\nengage children in analogue forms of behaviour, either alone or with others.\nCurrent interactive physical-digital play technologies include robots, digital\nagents, mixed or augmented reality devices, and smart-eye based gaming. Little\nis known, however, about the ways in which these technologies could promote or\ndamage child development. This systematic review was aimed at understanding if\nand how these physical-digital play technologies promoted developmentally\nrelevant behaviour in typically developing 0 to 12 year-olds. Psychology,\nEducation, and Computer Science databases were searched producing 635 paper. A\ntotal of 31 papers met the inclusion criteria, of which 17 were of high enough\nquality to be included for synthesis. Results indicate that these new\ninteractive play technologies could have a positive effect on children's\ndevelopmentally relevant behaviour. The review indicated specific ways in which\ndifferent behaviour were promoted. Providing information about own performance\npromoted self-monitoring. Slowing interactivity, play interdependency, and\njoint object accessibility promoted collaboration. Offering delimited choices\npromoted decision making. Problem solving and physical activity were promoted\nby requiring children to engage in them to keep playing. Four principles\nunderpinned the ways in which physical digital play technologies afforded child\nbehaviour. These included social expectations framing play situations, the\ndirectiveness of action regulations (inviting, guiding or forcing behaviours),\nthe technical features of play technologies (digital play mechanics and\nphysical characteristics), and the alignment between play goals, play\ntechnology and the play behaviours promoted.",

The most notable of such results are temporal logics on Nested\nWords, such as CaRet and NWTL. Recently, the logic OPTL was introduced, based\non the class of Operator Precedence Languages (OPLs), more powerful than Nested\nWords. We define the new OPL-based logic POTL and prove its FO-completeness.\nPOTL improves on NWTL by enabling the formulation of requirements involving\npre/post-conditions, stack inspection, and others in the presence of\nexception-like constructs. It improves on OPTL too, which instead we show not\nto be FO-complete; it also allows to express more easily stack inspection and\nfunction-local properties. In a separate paper we report a model checking\nprocedure for POTL and experimental results based on a prototype tool developed\ntherefor.

In contrast to existing work, we use training\ndata which solely stems from the uplink (UL) domain. This allows us to learn\nthe CNN centralized at the base station (BS). After training, the network\nparameters are offloaded to mobile terminals (MTs) within the coverage area of\nthe BS. The MTs can then obtain channel state information (CSI) of the MIMO\nchannels with the low-complexity CNN estimator. This circumvents the necessity\nof an infeasible amount of feedback, the acquisition of training data at the\nuser, and the offline training phase at each MT. Numerical results show that\nthe CNN which is trained solely on UL data performs equally well as the network\ntrained on DL data. Furthermore, the approach is able to outperform\nstate-of-the-art CE algorithms.",

Despite the growing popularity of VR gaming, user studies\ninto how it might affect the player experience (PX) during the gameplay are\nscarce. Accordingly, the current study investigated the effects of VR gaming\nand game genre on PX. We compared PX metrics for two game genres, strategy\n(more interactive) and racing (less interactive), across two gaming platforms,\nVR and traditional desktop gaming. Participants were randomly assigned to one\nof the gaming platforms, played both a strategy and racing game on their\ncorresponding platform, and provided PX ratings. Results revealed that,\nregardless of the game genre, participants in the VR gaming condition\nexperienced a greater level of sense of presence than did those in the desktop\ngaming condition. That said, results showed that the two gaming platforms did\nnot significantly differ from one another in PX ratings. As for the effect of\ngame genre, participants provided greater PX ratings for the strategy game than\nfor the racing game, regardless of whether the game was played on a VR headset\nor desktop computer. Collectively, these results indicate that although VR\ngaming affords a greater sense of presence in the game environment, this\nincrease in presence does not seem to translate into a more satisfactory PX\nwhen playing either a strategy or racing game.",

We also propose an energy efficient multi\nhop routing mechanism to avoid the high power requirement to transmit longer\ndistances.

    "title": "AutoLRS: Automatic Learning-Rate Schedule by Bayesian Optimization on  the Fly",
    "abstract": "The learning rate (LR) schedule is one of the most important hyper-parameters\nneeding careful tuning in training DNNs. However, it is also one of the least\nautomated parts of machine learning systems and usually costs significant\nmanual effort and computing. Though there are pre-defined LR schedules and\noptimizers with adaptive LR, they introduce new hyperparameters that need to be\ntuned separately for different tasks/datasets. In this paper, we consider the\nquestion: Can we automatically tune the LR over the course of training without\nhuman involvement? We propose an efficient method, AutoLRS, which automatically\noptimizes the LR for each training stage by modeling training dynamics. AutoLRS\naims to find an LR applied to every $\\tau$ steps that minimizes the resulted\nvalidation loss. We solve this black-box optimization on the fly by Bayesian\noptimization (BO). However, collecting training instances for BO requires a\nsystem to evaluate each LR queried by BO's acquisition function for $\\tau$\nsteps, which is prohibitively expensive in practice. Instead, we apply each\ncandidate LR for only $\\tau'\\ll\\tau$ steps and train an exponential model to\npredict the validation loss after $\\tau$ steps. This mutual-training process\nbetween BO and the loss-prediction model allows us to limit the training steps\ninvested in the BO search. We demonstrate the advantages and the generality of\nAutoLRS through extensive experiments of training DNNs for tasks from diverse\ndomains using different optimizers. The LR schedules auto-generated by AutoLRS\nlead to a speedup of $1.22\\times$, $1.43\\times$, and $1.5\\times$ when training\nResNet-50, Transformer, and BERT, respectively, compared to the LR schedules in\ntheir original papers, and an average speedup of $1.31\\times$ over\nstate-of-the-art heavily-tuned LR schedules.",

We adapt\nthis approach to arbitrary nonconvex polyhedra by generalizing strip flattening\nto nonorthogonal corners and slicing along a countably infinite number of\nparallel planes, with slices densely approaching every vertex of the manifold.\nWe also show that the area of the polyhedron that needs to support moving\ncreases (which are necessary for closed polyhedra by the Bellows Theorem) can\nbe made arbitrarily small.",

We propose a method, Partial Label Masking (PLM), which utilizes\nthis ratio during training. By stochastically masking labels during loss\ncomputation, the method balances this ratio for each class, leading to improved\nrecall on minority classes and improved precision on frequent classes. The\nratio is estimated adaptively based on the network's performance by minimizing\nthe KL divergence between predicted and ground-truth distributions. Whereas\nmost existing approaches addressing data imbalance are mainly focused on\nsingle-label classification and do not generalize well to the multi-label case,\nthis work proposes a general approach to solve the long-tail data imbalance\nissue for multi-label classification. PLM is versatile: it can be applied to\nmost objective functions and it can be used alongside other strategies for\nclass imbalance. Our method achieves strong performance when compared to\nexisting methods on both multi-label (MultiMNIST and MSCOCO) and single-label\n(imbalanced CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) image classification datasets.",

Spatial thinking skills can be enhanced by training, life\nexperience, and practice. One approach to train these skills is through 3D\nmodeling (also known as Computer-Aided Design or CAD). Although 3D modeling\ntools have shown promising results in training and enhancing spatial thinking\nskills in undergraduate engineering students when it comes to novices,\nespecially middle and high-school students, they are not sufficient to provide\nrich 3D experience since the 3D models created in CAD are isolated the actual\n3D physical world. Resulting in novice students finding it difficult to create\nerror-free 3D models that would 3D print successfully. This leads to student\nfrustration where students are not motivated to create 3D models themselves;\ninstead, they prefer to download them from online repositories. To address this\nproblem, researchers are focusing on integrating 3D models and displays into\nthe physical world with the help of technologies like Augmented Reality (AR).\nIn this demo, we present an AR application, 3DARVisualizer, that helps us\nexplore the role of AR as a 3D model debugger, including enhancing 3D modeling\nabilities and spatial thinking skills of middle- and high-school students.",

As the ground truth availability is limited with\nreal-world noisy datasets, previous papers created synthetic noisy datasets by\nrandomly modifying the labels of training examples of clean datasets. However,\nno final conclusions can be derived by just using this random noise, since it\nexcludes feature-dependent noise. Thus, it is imperative to generate\nfeature-dependent noisy datasets that additionally provide ground truth.\nTherefore, we propose an intuitive approach to creating feature-dependent noisy\ndatasets by utilizing the training predictions of DNNs on clean datasets that\nalso retain true label information. We refer to these datasets as \"Pseudo Noisy\ndatasets\". We conduct several experiments to establish that Pseudo noisy\ndatasets resemble feature-dependent noisy datasets across different conditions.\nWe further randomly generate synthetic noisy datasets with the same noise\ndistribution as that of Pseudo noise (referred as \"Randomized Noise\") to\nempirically show that i) learning is easier with feature-dependent label noise\ncompared to random noise, ii) irrespective of noise distribution, Pseudo noisy\ndatasets mimic feature-dependent label noise and iii) current training methods\nare not generalizable to feature-dependent label noise.

    "abstract": "Dependently-typed host languages empower users to verify a wide range of\nproperties of embedded languages and programs written in them. Designers of\nsuch embedded languages are faced with a difficult choice between using a\nshallow or a deep embedding. The former is easier to use because the entire\ninfrastructure of the host langauge is immediately available. Meanwhile, the\nlatter gives full access to the structure of embedded programs, but is\ndifficult to use in practice, especially when the embedded language is itself\ndependently typed.\nThe main insight presented in this paper is that the choice between shallow\nand deep embedding can be eliminated by working in a host language with\nreflection capabilities: we start from a shallow embedding that can use all\nlibraries and tools of the host language, and later use reflection to expose\nthe deep structure of the embedded programs.\nConcretely, we apply this technique to embed three programming languages --\nKaleidoscope, SaC, and (a subset of) APL -- into the dependently typed theorem\nprover Agda, using dependent types to statically enforce several properties of\ninterest. We then use Agda's reflection capabilities to extract the embedded\nprograms back into the original language, so that the existing toolchain can be\nleveraged.\nIn this process, statically verified properties of the host language are\nmapped onto runtime checks in the target language, allowing extracted programs\nto interact safely with existing code.\nFinally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with the\nimplementation and extraction of a convolutional neural network in our\nembedding of APL.\\@",

What began as an\nobservational effort in spring 2020became a year-long archive, exhibition, and\nbroadcasting platform that generated various hyper-local interfaces. The paper\narticulates an improvisational approach to media architecture in the form of\nself-reflection by the project initiators. Necessitated by the limitations\nimposed by the lockdowns on cultural production and public discourse, the paper\npresents an alternative conceptual approach to media architecture that is not\nbased on a fully-specified technological infrastructure for discourse and\ninteraction but instead on improvisational practices that manifest themselves\nin different technical interfaces. This improvisational approach is not merely\na mode of production, but raises questions of about the discourse of media\narchitecture and its underlying assumptions of methodological rigor. In\ntraditional HCI, systems and artifacts are often presented as stable and fully\nspecified, while their users are considered interchangeable. In contrast, we\nconsider urban media interfaces as improvisation-driven infrastructures (or\nimprostructures) in which the actors and their relationships are stable, while\nthe technologies they create are provisional and in flux. As a consequence, the\ndefining property of media architecture is no longer the structural integration\nof media into architecture but the embodiment of mediated communication in\nobjects and performances at concrete places. In an environment where many\nphysical spaces are longer accessible and human contact among strangers\ndiminished, the project explores the restorative function and capacities of\nmedia architecture for shared reflection and discourse in physical public\nspace.",

    "abstract": "In order to increase the resilience of distribution systems against\nhigh-impact low-probability (HILP) events, it is important to prioritize the\ndamaged assets so that the lost loads, especially critical and important loads,\ncan be restored faster. In addition, correctly predicting the number of repair\nteams during critical times contributes to restoring the network to the initial\nresilience level. For this reason, this paper discusses the prioritization of\nelectricity supply lines for evaluating the number of required repair teams. To\nthis end, the economic value of distribution system lines has been considered\nas a criterion representing the sensitivity of the network to hurricanes. The\nmodeling is based on value, in which the load value, failure probability of the\npoles, fragility curve, duration of line repair by the maintenance team, and\nthe topology factor have been considered. This is so that the significance of\nthe demand side, the failure extent and accessibility of the lines, the\nimportance of time, and the network configuration are considered. The results\nprovide a list of line priority for fault resolution, in which the topology\nfactor has a larger effect. The number of repair teams required to restore\ncritical and important loads is determined from this model. This modeling has\nbeen tested on an IEEE 33-bus network.

However, training vs. test data domain gaps often\nnegatively affect model performance.

In this paper, we focus on alleviating\nthe negative effect of domain shift by presenting our adapted human pose (AHuP)\napproach that addresses adaptation problems in both appearance and pose spaces.\nAHuP is built around a practical assumption that in real applications, data\nfrom target domain could be inaccessible or only limited information can be\nacquired.

    "abstract": "The majority of fatalities and traumatic injuries in heavy industries involve\nmobile plant and vehicles, often resulting from a lapse of attention or\ncommunication. Existing approaches to hazard identification include the use of\nhuman spotters, passive reversing cameras, non-differentiating proximity\nsensors and tag based systems. These approaches either suffer from problems of\nworker attention or require the use of additional devices on all workers and\nobstacles. Whilst computer vision detection systems have previously been\ndeployed in structured applications such as manufacturing and on-road vehicles,\nthere does not yet exist a robust and portable solution for use in unstructured\nenvironments like construction that effectively communicates risks to relevant\nworkers. To address these limitations, our solution, the Toolbox Spotter (TBS),\nacts to improve worker safety and reduce preventable incidents by employing an\nembedded robotic perception and distributed HMI alert system to augment both\ndetection and communication of hazards in safety critical environments. In this\npaper we outline the TBS safety system and evaluate its performance based on\ndata from real world implementations, demonstrating the suitability of the\nToolbox Spotter for applications in heavy industries.",

Such vulnerability makes it risky for some\nsecurity-related applications (e.g., semantic segmentation in autonomous cars)\nand triggers tremendous concerns on the model reliability. For the first time,\nwe comprehensively evaluate the robustness of existing UDA methods and propose\na robust UDA approach. It is rooted in two observations: (i) the robustness of\nUDA methods in semantic segmentation remains unexplored, which pose a security\nconcern in this field; and (ii) although commonly used self-supervision (e.g.,\nrotation and jigsaw) benefits image tasks such as classification and\nrecognition, they fail to provide the critical supervision signals that could\nlearn discriminative representation for segmentation tasks. These observations\nmotivate us to propose adversarial self-supervision UDA (or ASSUDA) that\nmaximizes the agreement between clean images and their adversarial examples by\na contrastive loss in the output space. Extensive empirical studies on commonly\nused benchmarks demonstrate that ASSUDA is resistant to adversarial attacks.",

The poor\nquality-of-service of unlicensed LPWAN, and the high service cost of\nLTE-M/NB-IoT are key disadvantages of these technologies. Concatenating\nunlicensed with licensed LPWANs can overcome these limitations and harness\ntheir benefits. However, a concatenated LPWAN architecture will inevitably\nresult in excess latency which may impact users' quality-of-experience (QoE).\nTo evaluate the real-life feasibility of this system, we first propose a\nconcatenated LPWAN architecture and experimentally measure the statistics of\nend-to-end (E2E) latencies. The concatenated delay margin is determined by\nbenchmarking the latencies with different LPWAN architecture schemes, namely\nwith unlicensed IoT (standalone LoRa), cellular IoT (standalone LTE-M), and\nconcatenated IoT (LoRa interfaced with LTE-M). Through extensive experimental\nmeasurement campaigns of 30,000 data points of E2E latencies, we show that the\nexcess delay due to LPWAN interfacing introduces on average less than 300\nmilliseconds. The proof-of-concept results suggest that the latency for\nconcatenating unlicensed LPWAN with cellular IoT is negligible for smart city\nuse cases where human perception and decision making is in the loop.",

    "abstract": "Applying chaos theory for secure digital communications is promising and it\nis well acknowledged that in such applications the underlying chaotic systems\nshould be carefully chosen. However, the requirements imposed on the chaotic\nsystems are usually heuristic, without theoretic guarantee for the resultant\ncommunication scheme. Among all the primitives for secure communications, it is\nwell-accepted that (pseudo) random numbers are most essential. Taking the\nwell-studied two-dimensional coupled map lattice (2D CML) as an example, this\npaper performs a theoretical study towards pseudo-random number generation with\nthe 2D CML. In so doing, an analytical expression of the Lyapunov exponent (LE)\nspectrum of the 2D CML is first derived. Using the LEs, one can configure\nsystem parameters to ensure the 2D CML only exhibits complex dynamic behavior,\nand then collect pseudo-random numbers from the system orbits. Moreover, based\non the observation that least significant bit distributes more evenly in the\n(pseudo) random distribution, an extraction algorithm E is developed with the\nproperty that, when applied to the orbits of the 2D CML, it can squeeze uniform\nbits. In implementation, if fixed-point arithmetic is used in binary format\nwith a precision of $z$ bits after the radix point, E can ensure that the\ndeviation of the squeezed bits is bounded by $2^{-z}$ . Further simulation\nresults demonstrate that the new method not only guide the 2D CML model to\nexhibit complex dynamic behavior, but also generate uniformly distributed\nindependent bits. In particular, the squeezed pseudo random bits can pass both\nNIST 800-22 and TestU01 test suites in various settings. This study thereby\nprovides a theoretical basis for effectively applying the 2D CML to secure\ncommunications.",

Recently, with the emerging of deep learning (DL), deep\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) based methods have shown their power and\nfeasibility in the field of change detection.

    "abstract": "Despite the prevalence of hypergraphs in a variety of high-impact\napplications, there are relatively few works on hypergraph representation\nlearning, most of which primarily focus on hyperlink prediction, often\nrestricted to the transductive learning setting. Among others, a major hurdle\nfor effective hypergraph representation learning lies in the label scarcity of\nnodes and/or hyperedges. To address this issue, this paper presents an\nend-to-end, bi-level pre-training strategy with Graph Neural Networks for\nhypergraphs. The proposed framework named HyperGene bears three distinctive\nadvantages. First, it is capable of ingesting the labeling information when\navailable, but more importantly, it is mainly designed in the self-supervised\nfashion which significantly broadens its applicability. Second, at the heart of\nthe proposed HyperGene are two carefully designed pretexts, one on the node\nlevel and the other on the hyperedge level, which enable us to encode both the\nlocal and the global context in a mutually complementary way. Third, the\nproposed framework can work in both transductive and inductive settings. When\napplying the two proposed pretexts in tandem, it can accelerate the adaptation\nof the knowledge from the pre-trained model to downstream applications in the\ntransductive setting, thanks to the bi-level nature of the proposed method. The\nextensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) HyperGene achieves up to\n5.69% improvements in hyperedge classification, and (2) improves pre-training\nefficiency by up to 42.80% on average.",

Previous studies have focused on modeling sequential\ndynamics without much regard to which of the best-selling products (i.e., head\nitems) or niche products (i.e., tail items) should be recommended. We\nscrutinize the structural reason for why tail items are barely served in the\ncurrent sequential recommendation model, which consists of an item-embedding\nlayer, a sequence-modeling layer, and a recommendation layer. Well-designed\nsequence-modeling and recommendation layers are expected to naturally learn\nsuitable item embeddings. However, tail items are likely to fall short of this\nexpectation because the current model structure is not suitable for learning\nhigh-quality embeddings with insufficient data. Thus, tail items are rarely\nrecommended. To eliminate this issue, we propose a framework called CITIES,\nwhich aims to enhance the quality of the tail-item embeddings by training an\nembedding-inference function using multiple contextual head items so that the\nrecommendation performance improves for not only the tail items but also for\nthe head items. Moreover, our framework can infer new-item embeddings without\nan additional learning process. Extensive experiments on two real-world\ndatasets show that applying CITIES to the state-of-the-art methods improves\nrecommendation performance for both tail and head items.

    "abstract": "Many industries with convolutional neural network models offer\nprivacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) classification service, that is, a\nservice that performs classification of private data for clients while\nguaranteeing privacy. This work aims to study deep learning on the encrypted\ndata using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). To implement deep learning on\nFHE, ReLU and max-pooling functions should be approximated by some polynomials\nfor homomorphic operations. Since the approximate polynomials studied up to now\nhave large errors in ReLU and max-pooling functions, using these polynomials\nrequires many epochs retraining for the classification of small datasets such\nas MNIST and CIFAR-10. In addition, large datasets such as ImageNet cannot be\nclassified with high accuracy even with many epoch retraining using these\npolynomials. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a precise polynomial\napproximation technique for ReLU and max-pooling functions. Since precise\napproximation requires a very high-degree polynomial, which may cause large\nnumerical errors in FHE, we propose a method to approximate ReLU and\nmax-pooling functions accurately using a composition of minimax approximate\npolynomials of small degrees. If we replace the ReLU and max-pooling functions\nwith the proposed approximate polynomials, deep learning models such as ResNet\nand VGGNet, which have already been studied a lot, can still be used without\nfurther modification for PPML on FHE, and even pretrained parameters can be\nused without retraining. When we approximate ReLU function in the ResNet-152\nusing the composition of minimax approximate polynomials of degrees 15, 27, and\n29, we succeed in classifying the plaintext ImageNet dataset for the first time\nwith 77.52% accuracy, which is very close to the original model accuracy of\n78.31%.",

    "abstract": "Although monocular 3D human pose estimation methods have made significant\nprogress, it's far from being solved due to the inherent depth ambiguity.\nInstead, exploiting multi-view information is a practical way to achieve\nabsolute 3D human pose estimation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet\neffective pipeline for weakly-supervised cross-view 3D human pose estimation.\nBy only using two camera views, our method can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance in a weakly-supervised manner, requiring no 3D ground truth but\nonly 2D annotations. Specifically, our method contains two steps: triangulation\nand refinement. First, given the 2D keypoints that can be obtained through any\nclassic 2D detection methods, triangulation is performed across two views to\nlift the 2D keypoints into coarse 3D poses.Then, a novel cross-view U-shaped\ngraph convolutional network (CV-UGCN), which can explore the spatial\nconfigurations and cross-view correlations, is designed to refine the coarse 3D\nposes. In particular, the refinement progress is achieved through\nweakly-supervised learning, in which geometric and structure-aware consistency\nchecks are performed. We evaluate our method on the standard benchmark dataset,\nHuman3.6M. The Mean Per Joint Position Error on the benchmark dataset is 27.4\nmm, which outperforms the state-of-the-arts remarkably (27.4 mm vs 30.2 mm).",

    "abstract": "Learning Granger causality among event types on multi-type event sequences is\nan important but challenging task. Existing methods, such as the Multivariate\nHawkes processes, mostly assumed that each sequence is independent and\nidentically distributed. However, in many real-world applications, it is\ncommonplace to encounter a topological network behind the event sequences such\nthat an event is excited or inhibited not only by its history but also by its\ntopological neighbors. Consequently, the failure in describing the topological\ndependency among the event sequences leads to the error detection of the causal\nstructure. By considering the Hawkes processes from the view of temporal\nconvolution, we propose a Topological Hawkes processes (THP) to draw a\nconnection between the graph convolution in topology domain and the temporal\nconvolution in time domains. We further propose a Granger causality learning\nmethod on THP in a likelihood framework.

    "abstract": "Visual localization is of great importance in robotics and computer vision.\nRecently, scene coordinate regression based methods have shown good performance\nin visual localization in small static scenes. However, it still estimates\ncamera poses from many inferior scene coordinates. To address this problem, we\npropose a novel visual localization framework that establishes 2D-to-3D\ncorrespondences between the query image and the 3D map with a series of\nlearnable scene-specific landmarks. In the landmark generation stage, the 3D\nsurfaces of the target scene are over-segmented into mosaic patches whose\ncenters are regarded as the scene-specific landmarks. To robustly and\naccurately recover the scene-specific landmarks, we propose the Voting with\nSegmentation Network (VS-Net) to segment the pixels into different landmark\npatches with a segmentation branch and estimate the landmark locations within\neach patch with a landmark location voting branch. Since the number of\nlandmarks in a scene may reach up to 5000, training a segmentation network with\nsuch a large number of classes is both computation and memory costly for the\ncommonly used cross-entropy loss. We propose a novel prototype-based triplet\nloss with hard negative mining, which is able to train semantic segmentation\nnetworks with a large number of labels efficiently.

Several data quality challenges such as noise, incompleteness, outliers\nand duplicate data points may be relevant in this regard. Objective: We\ninvestigate the reporting of three potentially influential elements of data\nquality in ESE studies: data collection, data pre-processing, and the\nidentification of data quality issues. This enables us to establish how\nresearchers view the topic of data quality and the mechanisms that are being\nused to address it. Greater awareness of data quality should inform both the\nsound conduct of ESE research and the robust practice of ESE data collection\nand processing. Method: We performed a targeted literature review of empirical\nsoftware engineering studies covering the period January 2007 to September\n2012. A total of 221 relevant studies met our inclusion criteria and were\ncharacterized in terms of their consideration and treatment of data quality.\nResults: We obtained useful insights as to how the ESE community considers\nthese three elements of data quality. Only 23 of these 221 studies reported on\nall three elements of data quality considered in this paper. Conclusion: The\nreporting of data collection procedures is not documented consistently in ESE\nstudies. It will be useful if data collection challenges are reported in order\nto improve our understanding of why there are problems with software\nengineering data sets and the models developed from them. More generally, data\nquality should be given far greater attention by the community. The improvement\nof data sets through enhanced data collection, pre-processing and quality\nassessment should lead to more reliable prediction models, thus improving the\npractice of software engineering.",

These tools\nreflect the distributed nature of traces and the underlying causality and\nconcurrency between events, and can be said to support true concurrency. They\ngeneralize the tools that have been so efficient in understanding, classifying\nand reasoning about word languages. In particular, we introduce an asynchronous\nversion of the wreath product operation and we describe the trace languages\nrecognized by such products (the so-called asynchronous wreath product\nprinciple). We then propose a decomposition result for recognizable trace\nlanguages, analogous to the Krohn-Rhodes theorem, and we prove this\ndecomposition result in the special case of acyclic architectures. Finally, we\nintroduce and analyze two distributed automata-theoretic operations. One, the\nlocal cascade product, is a direct implementation of the asynchronous wreath\nproduct operation. The other, global cascade sequences, although conceptually\nand operationally similar to the local cascade product, translates to a more\ncomplex asynchronous implementation which uses the gossip automaton of Mukund\nand Sohoni. This leads to interesting applications to the characterization of\ntrace languages definable in first-order logic: they are accepted by a\nrestricted local cascade product of the gossip automaton and 2-state\nasynchronous reset automata, and also by a global cascade sequence of 2-state\nasynchronous reset automata. Over distributed alphabets for which the\nasynchronous Krohn-Rhodes theorem holds, a local cascade product of such\nautomata is sufficient and this, in turn, leads to the identification of a\nsimple temporal logic which is expressively complete for such alphabets.",

However, little is known about the dependence of temporal patterns\nof popularity on event-related information, e.g. which types of events trigger\nlong-lasting activity. Here we propose a simple model that describes the\ndynamics around peaks of popularity by incorporating key features, i.e., the\nanticipatory growth and the decay of collective attention together with\ncircadian rhythms. The proposed model allows us to develop a new method for\npredicting the future page view activity and for clustering time series. To\nvalidate our methodology, we collect a corpus of page view data from Wikipedia\nassociated to a range of planned events, that are events which we know in\nadvance will have a fixed date in the future, such as elections and sport\nevents. Our methodology is superior to existing models in both prediction and\nclustering tasks.

Also, identification using a parametric noise model\n(like BJ method) can suffer from local minima, however neglecting the noise\nmodel has its impact on the variance of the estimates. In this paper, we\nprovide a two-step identification approach to avoid these problems. The first\nstep involves performing a non-parametric indirect approach for a MISO\nidentification problem to get the non-parametric frequency response function\n(FRF) estimates and its variance as a function of frequency. In the second\nstep, the estimated non-parametric FRF of the target module is smoothed using a\nparametric frequency domain estimator with the estimated variance from the\nprevious step as the non-parametric noise model. The developed approach is\npractical with weak assumptions on noise, uses the available toolbox, requires\na parametric model only for the target module of interest, and uses a\nnon-parametric noise model to reduce the variance of the estimates.

These techniques use predefined or globally\nlearned joint relationships, which may fail to capture pose-dependent\nconstraints. To address this problem, we propose a two-stage GCN-based\nframework that learns per-pose relationship constraints.

This spatial dependency information guides this phase\nto estimate reliable 2D and 3D poses. The second stage further improves the 3D\nestimation through a GCN-based module that uses an adaptative nearest neighbor\nalgorithm to determine joint relationships. Extensive experiments show that our\nmulti-stage GCN approach yields an efficient model that produces accurate 2D/3D\nhand poses and outperforms the state-of-the-art on two public datasets.",

We evaluate the fidelity and performance of our system when\napplied to both stratified and non-stratified programs. We perform a sanity\ncheck by comparing PASOCS to available systems for stratified programs, where\nthe semantics agree, and show that our system is competitive on unstratified\nprograms.",

    "abstract": "The advances in pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, XLNET and etc) have largely\nrevolutionized the predictive performance of various modern natural language\nprocessing tasks. This allows corporations to provide machine learning as a\nservice (MLaaS) by encapsulating fine-tuned BERT-based models as commercial\nAPIs. However, previous works have discovered a series of vulnerabilities in\nBERT- based APIs. For example, BERT-based APIs are vulnerable to both model\nextraction attack and adversarial example transferrability attack. However, due\nto the high capacity of BERT-based APIs, the fine-tuned model is easy to be\noverlearned, what kind of information can be leaked from the extracted model\nremains unknown and is lacking. To bridge this gap, in this work, we first\npresent an effective model extraction attack, where the adversary can\npractically steal a BERT-based API (the target/victim model) by only querying a\nlimited number of queries. We further develop an effective attribute inference\nattack to expose the sensitive attribute of the training data used by the\nBERT-based APIs. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets under various\nrealistic settings demonstrate the potential vulnerabilities of BERT-based\nAPIs.",

We present a framework to model process\ndata as graphs, i.e., Process Graph, and present abstractions to summarize the\nprocess graph and to discover concept hierarchies for entities based on both\ndata objects and their interactions in process graphs. We present a language,\nnamely BP-SPARQL, for the explorative querying and understanding of process\ngraphs from various user perspectives.

However, datasets for tasks with scientific text require\nexpensive manual annotation and tend to be small and limited to only one or a\nfew fields. At the same time, scientific documents contain many potential\ntraining signals, such as citations, which can be used to build large labelled\ndatasets. Given this, we present an in-depth study of cite-worthiness detection\nin English, where a sentence is labelled for whether or not it cites an\nexternal source. To accomplish this, we introduce CiteWorth, a large,\ncontextualized, rigorously cleaned labelled dataset for cite-worthiness\ndetection built from a massive corpus of extracted plain-text scientific\ndocuments. We show that CiteWorth is high-quality, challenging, and suitable\nfor studying problems such as domain adaptation. Our best performing\ncite-worthiness detection model is a paragraph-level contextualized sentence\nlabelling model based on Longformer, exhibiting a 5 F1 point improvement over\nSciBERT which considers only individual sentences. Finally, we demonstrate that\nlanguage model fine-tuning with cite-worthiness as a secondary task leads to\nimproved performance on downstream scientific document understanding tasks.",

The forensics analysis of a security incident is essential, as drones\nare flying above populated areas and have also been weaponised from radical\nforces and perpetrators. Thus, it is an imperative need to establish a Drone\nDigital Forensics Investigation Framework and standardise the processes of\ncollecting and processing such evidence. Although there are numerous drone\nplatforms in the market, the same principles apply to all of them; just like\nmobile phones. Nevertheless, due to the nature of drones, standardised\nforensics procedures to date do not manage to address the required processes\nand challenges that such investigations pose. Acknowledging this need, we\ndetail the unique characteristics of drones and the gaps in existing\nmethodologies and standards, showcasing that there are fundamental issues in\nterms of their forensics analysis from various perspectives, ranging from\noperational and procedural ones, and escalate to manufacturers, as well as\nlegal restrictions.

    "abstract": "Recently, DETR and Deformable DETR have been proposed to eliminate the need\nfor many hand-designed components in object detection while demonstrating good\nperformance as previous complex hand-crafted detectors. However, their\nperformance on Video Object Detection (VOD) has not been well explored. In this\npaper, we present TransVOD, an end-to-end video object detection model based on\na spatial-temporal Transformer architecture. The goal of this paper is to\nstreamline the pipeline of VOD, effectively removing the need for many\nhand-crafted components for feature aggregation, e.g., optical flow, recurrent\nneural networks, relation networks. Besides, benefited from the object query\ndesign in DETR, our method does not need complicated post-processing methods\nsuch as Seq-NMS or Tubelet rescoring, which keeps the pipeline simple and\nclean. In particular, we present temporal Transformer to aggregate both the\nspatial object queries and the feature memories of each frame. Our temporal\nTransformer consists of three components: Temporal Deformable Transformer\nEncoder (TDTE) to encode the multiple frame spatial details, Temporal Query\nEncoder (TQE) to fuse object queries, and Temporal Deformable Transformer\nDecoder to obtain current frame detection results. These designs boost the\nstrong baseline deformable DETR by a significant margin (3%-4% mAP) on the\nImageNet VID dataset. TransVOD yields comparable results performance on the\nbenchmark of ImageNet VID. We hope our TransVOD can provide a new perspective\nfor video object detection.

Colonoscopy is a widely used technique for colon screening\nand polyp lesions diagnosis. Nevertheless, manual screening using colonoscopy\nsuffers from a substantial miss rate of polyps and is an overwhelming burden\nfor endoscopists. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for polyp detection has the\npotential to reduce human error and human burden. However, current polyp\ndetection methods based on object detection framework need many handcrafted\npre-processing and post-processing operations or user guidance that require\ndomain-specific knowledge.\nMethods: In this paper, we propose a convolution in transformer (COTR)\nnetwork for end-to-end polyp detection. Motivated by the detection transformer\n(DETR), COTR is constituted by a CNN for feature extraction, transformer\nencoder layers interleaved with convolutional layers for feature encoding and\nrecalibration, transformer decoder layers for object querying, and a\nfeed-forward network for detection prediction. Considering the slow convergence\nof DETR, COTR embeds convolution layers into transformer encoder for feature\nreconstruction and convergence acceleration.\nResults: Experimental results on two public polyp datasets show that COTR\nachieved 91.49\\% precision, 82.69% sensitivity, and 86.87% F1-score on the\nETIS-LARIB, and 91.67% precision, 93.54% sensitivity, and 92.60% F1-score on\nthe CVC-ColonDB.\nConclusion: This study proposed an end to end detection method based on\ndetection transformer for colorectal polyp detection.

    "title": "Boosting Crowd Counting with Transformers",
    "abstract": "Significant progress on the crowd counting problem has been achieved by\nintegrating larger context into convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This\nindicates that global scene context is essential, despite the seemingly\nbottom-up nature of the problem. This may be explained by the fact that context\nknowledge can adapt and improve local feature extraction to a given scene. In\nthis paper, we therefore investigate the role of global context for crowd\ncounting. Specifically, a pure transformer is used to extract features with\nglobal information from overlapping image patches. Inspired by classification,\nwe add a context token to the input sequence, to facilitate information\nexchange with tokens corresponding to image patches throughout transformer\nlayers. Due to the fact that transformers do not explicitly model the\ntried-and-true channel-wise interactions, we propose a token-attention module\n(TAM) to recalibrate encoded features through channel-wise attention informed\nby the context token. Beyond that, it is adopted to predict the total person\ncount of the image through regression-token module (RTM). Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various\ndatasets, including ShanghaiTech, UCF-QNRF, JHU-CROWD++ and NWPU.

However, for\nmultisource tasks that involve relatively small objects, even the smallest\nregistration errors can introduce high uncertainty in the classification\nprocess. We approach this problem from a weakly supervised learning perspective\nin which the input images correspond to larger neighborhoods around the\nexpected object locations where an object with a given class label is present\nin the neighborhood without any knowledge of its exact location. The proposed\nmethod uses a single-source deep instance attention model with parallel\nbranches for joint localization and classification of objects, and extends this\nmodel into a multisource setting where a reference source that is assumed to\nhave no location uncertainty is used to aid the fusion of multiple sources in\nfour different levels: probability level, logit level, feature level, and pixel\nlevel. We show that all levels of fusion provide higher accuracies compared to\nthe state-of-the-art, with the best performing method of feature-level fusion\nresulting in 53% accuracy for the recognition of 40 different types of trees,\ncorresponding to an improvement of 5.7% over the best performing baseline when\nRGB, multispectral, and LiDAR data are used.

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D human pose estimation from a single RGB image has received a lot\nattentions in the past few year. Pose inference models with competitive\nperformance however require supervision with 3D pose ground truth data or at\nleast known pose priors in their target domain. Yet, these data requirements in\nmany real-world applications with data collection constraints may not be\nachievable. In this paper, we present a heuristic weakly supervised solution,\ncalled HW-HuP to estimate 3D human pose in contexts that no ground truth 3D\ndata is accessible, even for fine-tuning. HW-HuP learns partial pose priors\nfrom public 3D human pose datasets and uses easy-to-access observations from\nthe target domain to iteratively estimate 3D human pose and shape in an\noptimization and regression hybrid cycle. In our design, depth data as an\nauxiliary information is employed as weak supervision during training, yet it\nis not needed for the inference. We evaluate HW-HuP performance qualitatively\non datasets of both in-bed human and infant poses, where no ground truth 3D\npose is provided neither any target prior. We also test HW-HuP performance\nquantitatively on a publicly available motion capture dataset against the 3D\nground truth. HW-HuP is also able to be extended to other input modalities for\npose estimation tasks especially under adverse vision conditions, such as\nocclusion or full darkness. On the Human3.6M benchmark, HW-HuP shows 104.1mm in\nMPJPE and 50.4mm in PA MPJPE, comparable to the existing state-of-the-art\napproaches that benefit from full 3D pose supervision.",

Despite the advances in recent\nyears, cybersecurity on BCI is an open challenge since attackers can exploit\nthe vulnerabilities of invasive BCIs to induce malicious stimulation or\ntreatment disruption, affecting neuronal activity. In this work, we design and\nimplement a novel neuronal cyberattack, called Neuronal Jamming (JAM), which\nprevents neurons from producing spikes. To implement and measure the JAM\nimpact, and due to the lack of realistic neuronal topologies in mammalians, we\nhave defined a use case with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to\nallow a mouse to exit a particular maze. The resulting model has been\ntranslated to a neural topology, simulating a portion of a mouse's visual\ncortex. The impact of JAM on both biological and artificial networks is\nmeasured, analyzing how the attacks can both disrupt the spontaneous neural\nsignaling and the mouse's capacity to exit the maze. Besides, we compare the\nimpacts of both JAM and FLO (an existing neural cyberattack) demonstrating that\nJAM generates a higher impact in terms of neuronal spike rate.

    "abstract": "Power laws have been found to describe a wide variety of natural (physical,\nbiological, astronomic, meteorological, geological) and man-made (social,\nfinancial, computational) phenomena over a wide range of magnitudes, although\ntheir underlying mechanisms are not always clear. In statistics, power law\ndistribution is often found to fit data exceptionally well when the normal\n(Gaussian) distribution fails. Nevertheless, predicting power law phenomena is\nnotoriously difficult because some of its idiosyncratic properties such as lack\nof well-defined average value, and potentially unbounded variance. TPL (Taylor\npower law), a power law first discovered to characterize the spatial and/or\ntemporal distribution of biological populations and recently extended to\ndescribe the spatiotemporal heterogeneities (distributions) of human\nmicrobiomes and other natural and artificial systems such as fitness\ndistribution in computational (artificial) intelligence. The power law with\nexponential cutoff (PLEC) is a variant of power-law function that tapers off\nthe exponential growth of power-law function ultimately and can be particularly\nuseful for certain predictive problems such as biodiversity estimation and\nturning-point prediction for COVID-19 infection/fatality. Here, we propose\ncoupling (integration) of TPL and PLEC to offer improved prediction quality of\ncertain power-law phenomena. The coupling takes advantages of variance\nprediction using TPL and the asymptote estimation using PLEC and delivers\nconfidence interval for the asymptote. We demonstrate the integrated approach\nto the estimation of potential (dark) biodiversity and turning point of\nCOVID-19 fatality.

    "abstract": "Quantization is a technique used in deep neural networks (DNNs) to increase\nexecution performance and hardware efficiency. Uniform post-training\nquantization (PTQ) methods are common, since they can be implemented\nefficiently in hardware and do not require extensive hardware resources or a\ntraining set. Mapping FP32 models to INT8 using uniform PTQ yields models with\nnegligible accuracy degradation; however, reducing precision below 8 bits with\nPTQ is challenging, as accuracy degradation becomes noticeable, due to the\nincrease in quantization noise. In this paper, we propose a sparsity-aware\nquantization (SPARQ) method, in which the unstructured and dynamic activation\nsparsity is leveraged in different representation granularities. 4-bit\nquantization, for example, is employed by dynamically examining the bits of\n8-bit values and choosing a window of 4 bits, while first skipping zero-value\nbits. Moreover, instead of quantizing activation-by-activation to 4 bits, we\nfocus on pairs of 8-bit activations and examine whether one of the two is equal\nto zero. If one is equal to zero, the second can opportunistically use the\nother's 4-bit budget; if both do not equal zero, then each is dynamically\nquantized to 4 bits, as described. SPARQ achieves minor accuracy degradation,\n2x speedup over widely used hardware architectures, and a practical hardware\nimplementation. The code is available at https://github.com/gilshm/sparq.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have attracted great interest in the last few\nyears owing to their ability to cover large areas and access difficult and\nhazardous target zones, which is not the case of traditional systems relying on\ndirect observations obtained from fixed cameras and sensors. Furthermore,\nthanks to the advancements in computer vision and machine learning, UAVs are\nbeing adopted for a broad range of solutions and applications. However, Deep\nNeural Networks (DNNs) are progressing toward deeper and complex models that\nprevent them from being executed on-board. In this paper, we propose a DNN\ndistribution methodology within UAVs to enable data classification in\nresource-constrained devices and avoid extra delays introduced by the\nserver-based solutions due to data communication over air-to-ground links. The\nproposed method is formulated as an optimization problem that aims to minimize\nthe latency between data collection and decision-making while considering the\nmobility model and the resource constraints of the UAVs as part of the\nair-to-air communication. We also introduce the mobility prediction to adapt\nour system to the dynamics of UAVs and the network variation. The simulation\nconducted to evaluate the performance and benchmark the proposed methods,\nnamely Optimal UAV-based Layer Distribution (OULD) and OULD with Mobility\nPrediction (OULD-MP), were run in an HPC cluster. The obtained results show\nthat our optimization solution outperforms the existing and heuristic-based\napproaches.",

    "title": "Revisiting 2D Convolutional Neural Networks for Graph-based Applications",
    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are widely used in graph-based\napplications such as graph classification and segmentation. However, current\nGCNs have limitations on implementation such as network architectures due to\ntheir irregular inputs. In contrast, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are\ncapable of extracting rich features from large-scale input data, but they do\nnot support general graph inputs. To bridge the gap between GCNs and CNNs, in\nthis paper we study the problem of how to effectively and efficiently map\ngeneral graphs to 2D grids that CNNs can be directly applied to, while\npreserving graph topology as much as possible. We therefore propose two novel\ngraph-to-grid mapping schemes, namely, {\\em graph-preserving grid layout\n(GPGL)} and its extension {\\em Hierarchical GPGL (H-GPGL)} for computational\nefficiency. We formulate the GPGL problem as integer programming and further\npropose an approximate yet efficient solver based on a penalized Kamada-Kawai\nmethod, a well-known optimization algorithm in 2D graph drawing. We propose a\nnovel vertex separation penalty that encourages graph vertices to lay on the\ngrid without any overlap. Along with this image representation, even extra 2D\nmaxpooling layers contribute to the PointNet, a widely applied point-based\nneural network. We demonstrate the empirical success of GPGL on general graph\nclassification with small graphs and H-GPGL on 3D point cloud segmentation with\nlarge graphs, based on 2D CNNs including VGG16, ResNet50 and multi-scale maxout\n(MSM) CNN.",

    "abstract": "As global trends are shifting towards data-driven industries, the demand for\nautomated algorithms that can convert digital images of scanned documents into\nmachine readable information is rapidly growing. Besides the opportunity of\ndata digitization for the application of data analytic tools, there is also a\nmassive improvement towards automation of processes, which previously would\nrequire manual inspection of the documents. Although the introduction of\noptical character recognition technologies mostly solved the task of converting\nhuman-readable characters from images into machine-readable characters, the\ntask of extracting table semantics has been less focused on over the years. The\nrecognition of tables consists of two main tasks, namely table detection and\ntable structure recognition. Most prior work on this problem focuses on either\ntask without offering an end-to-end solution or paying attention to real\napplication conditions like rotated images or noise artefacts inside the\ndocument image. Recent work shows a clear trend towards deep learning\napproaches coupled with the use of transfer learning for the task of table\nstructure recognition due to the lack of sufficiently large datasets. In this\npaper we present a multistage pipeline named Multi-Type-TD-TSR, which offers an\nend-to-end solution for the problem of table recognition. It utilizes\nstate-of-the-art deep learning models for table detection and differentiates\nbetween 3 different types of tables based on the tables' borders. For the table\nstructure recognition we use a deterministic non-data driven algorithm, which\nworks on all table types. We additionally present two algorithms. One for\nunbordered tables and one for bordered tables, which are the base of the used\ntable structure recognition algorithm. We evaluate Multi-Type-TD-TSR on the\nICDAR 2019 table structure recognition dataset and achieve a new\nstate-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has recently received a lot of attention for\nlarge-scale privacy-preserving machine learning. However, high communication\noverheads due to frequent gradient transmissions decelerate FL. To mitigate the\ncommunication overheads, two main techniques have been studied: (i) local\nupdate of weights characterizing the trade-off between communication and\ncomputation and (ii) gradient compression characterizing the trade-off between\ncommunication and precision. To the best of our knowledge, studying and\nbalancing those two trade-offs jointly and dynamically while considering their\nimpacts on convergence has remained unresolved even though it promises\nsignificantly faster FL. In this paper, we first formulate our problem to\nminimize learning error with respect to two variables: local update\ncoefficients and sparsity budgets of gradient compression who characterize\ntrade-offs between communication and computation/precision, respectively. We\nthen derive an upper bound of the learning error in a given wall-clock time\nconsidering the interdependency between the two variables. Based on this\ntheoretical analysis, we propose an enhanced FL scheme, namely Fast FL (FFL),\nthat jointly and dynamically adjusts the two variables to minimize the learning\nerror. We demonstrate that FFL consistently achieves higher accuracies faster\nthan similar schemes existing in the literature.",

To overcome these problems, we propose a\nmultilayer resource-aware partitioning method to minimize the resource wastage\nand maximize the service placement and deadline satisfaction rates in a Fog\ninfrastructure with high multi-user application placement requests.

Simulation results show that our multilayer resource-aware\npartitioning method is able to place twice as many services, satisfy deadlines\nfor three times as many application requests, and reduce the resource wastage\nby up to 15-32 times compared to two availability-aware and resource-aware\nmethods.",

Towards interpretability, this work proposes a\nsequence-to-sequence sleep-staging model, namely SleepTransformer. It is based\non the transformer backbone whose self-attention scores offer interpretability\nof the model's decisions at both the epoch and sequence level. At the epoch\nlevel, the attention scores can be encoded as a heat map to highlight\nsleep-relevant features captured from the input EEG signal. At the sequence\nlevel, the attention scores are visualized as the influence of different\nneighboring epochs in an input sequence (i.e. the context) to recognition of a\ntarget epoch, mimicking the way manual scoring is done by human experts. We\nfurther propose a simple yet efficient method to quantify uncertainty in the\nmodel's decisions. The method, which is based on entropy, can serve as a metric\nfor deferring low-confidence epochs to a human expert for further inspection.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that the proposed SleepTransformer outperforms\nexisting methods at a lower computational cost and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on two experimental databases of different sizes.",

    "abstract": "Grammar compression is, next to Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) and run-length\nBurrows-Wheeler transform (RLBWT), one of the most flexible approaches to\nrepresenting and processing highly compressible strings. The main idea is to\nrepresent a text as a context-free grammar whose language is precisely the\ninput string. This is called a straight-line grammar (SLG). An AVL grammar,\nproposed by Rytter [Theor. Comput. Sci., 2003] is a type of SLG that\nadditionally satisfies the AVL-property: the heights of parse-trees for\nchildren of every nonterminal differ by at most one. In contrast to other SLG\nconstructions, AVL grammars can be constructed from the LZ77 parsing in\ncompressed time: $\\mathcal{O}(z \\log n)$ where $z$ is the size of the LZ77\nparsing and $n$ is the length of the input text. Despite these advantages, AVL\ngrammars are thought to be too large to be practical.\nWe present a new technique for rapidly constructing a small AVL grammar from\nan LZ77 or LZ77-like parse. Our algorithm produces grammars that are always at\nleast five times smaller than those produced by the original algorithm, and\nnever more than double the size of grammars produced by the practical Re-Pair\ncompressor [Larsson and Moffat, Proc. IEEE, 2000]. Our algorithm also achieves\nlow peak RAM usage. By combining this algorithm with recent advances in\napproximating the LZ77 parsing, we show that our method has the potential to\nconstruct a run-length BWT from an LZ77 parse in about one third of the time\nand peak RAM required by other approaches. Overall, we show that AVL grammars\nare surprisingly practical, opening the door to much faster construction of key\ncompressed data structures.",

    "abstract": "With the increase in the learning capability of deep convolution-based\narchitectures, various applications of such models have been proposed over\ntime. In the field of anomaly detection, improvements in deep learning opened\nnew prospects of exploration for the researchers whom tried to automate the\nlabor-intensive features of data collection. First, in terms of data\ncollection, it is impossible to anticipate all the anomalies that might exist\nin a given environment. Second, assuming we limit the possibilities of\nanomalies, it will still be hard to record all these scenarios for the sake of\ntraining a model. Third, even if we manage to record a significant amount of\nabnormal data, it's laborious to annotate this data on pixel or even frame\nlevel. Various approaches address the problem by proposing one-class\nclassification using generative models trained on only normal data. In such\nmethods, only the normal data is used, which is abundantly available and\ndoesn't require significant human input. However, these are trained with only\nnormal data and at the test time, given abnormal data as input, may often\ngenerate normal-looking output. This happens due to the hallucination\ncharacteristic of generative models. Next, these systems are designed to not\nuse abnormal examples during the training. In this paper, we propose anomaly\ndetection with negative learning (ADNL), which employs the negative learning\nconcept for the enhancement of anomaly detection by utilizing a very small\nnumber of labeled anomaly data as compared with the normal data during\ntraining. The idea is to limit the reconstruction capability of a generative\nmodel using the given a small amount of anomaly examples. This way, the network\nnot only learns to reconstruct normal data but also encloses the normal\ndistribution far from the possible distribution of anomalies.",

The related studies for tackling IoT botnets are concerned with\neither capturing or analysing IoT botnet samples, using honeypots and\nsandboxes, respectively. The lack of integration between the two implies that\nthe samples captured by the honeypots must be manually submitted for analysis,\nintroducing a delay during which a botnet may change its operation.\nFurthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed sandboxes is limited by the\npotential use of anti-analysis techniques and the inability to identify\nfeatures for effective detection and identification of IoT botnets. In this\npaper, we propose the IoT-BDA framework for automated capturing, analysis,\nidentification, and reporting of IoT botnets. The captured samples are analysed\nin real-time to identify indicators of compromise and attack, along with\nanti-analysis, persistence, and anti-forensics techniques. These features can\nhelp botnet detection and analysis, as well as infection remedy. The framework\nreports the findings to a blacklist and abuse service to facilitate botnet\nsuspension. We also describe the discovered anti-honeypot techniques and the\nmeasures applied to reduce the risk of honeypot detection. Over the period of\nseven months, the framework captured, analysed, and reported 4077 unique IoT\nbotnet samples. The analysis results show that IoT botnets may employ\npersistence, anti-analysis and anti-forensics techniques typical for\ntraditional botnets. The in-depth analysis also discovered IoT botnets using\ntechniques for evading network detection.",

    "abstract": "Video prediction is a challenging task with wide application prospects in\nmeteorology and robot systems. Existing works fail to trade off short-term and\nlong-term prediction performances and extract robust latent dynamics laws in\nvideo frames. We propose a two-branch seq-to-seq deep model to disentangle the\nTaylor feature and the residual feature in video frames by a novel recurrent\nprediction module (TaylorCell) and residual module. TaylorCell can expand the\nvideo frames' high-dimensional features into the finite Taylor series to\ndescribe the latent laws. In TaylorCell, we propose the Taylor prediction unit\n(TPU) and the memory correction unit (MCU). TPU employs the first input frame's\nderivative information to predict the future frames, avoiding error\naccumulation. MCU distills all past frames' information to correct the\npredicted Taylor feature from TPU. Correspondingly, the residual module\nextracts the residual feature complementary to the Taylor feature. On three\ngeneralist datasets (Moving MNIST, TaxiBJ, Human 3.6), our model outperforms or\nreaches state-of-the-art models, and ablation experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our model in long-term prediction.",

    "abstract": "Policy optimization, which learns the policy of interest by maximizing the\nvalue function via large-scale optimization techniques, lies at the heart of\nmodern reinforcement learning (RL). In addition to value maximization, other\npractical considerations arise commonly as well, including the need of\nencouraging exploration, and that of ensuring certain structural properties of\nthe learned policy due to safety, resource and operational constraints. These\nconsiderations can often be accounted for by resorting to regularized RL, which\naugments the target value function with a structure-promoting regularization\nterm.\nFocusing on an infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision process, this\npaper proposes a generalized policy mirror descent (GPMD) algorithm for solving\nregularized RL.

    "abstract": "Algorithmic fairness is becoming increasingly important in data mining and\nmachine learning, and one of the most fundamental notions is group fairness.\nThe vast majority of the existing works on group fairness, with a few\nexceptions, primarily focus on debiasing with respect to a single sensitive\nattribute, despite the fact that the co-existence of multiple sensitive\nattributes (e.g., gender, race, marital status, etc.) in the real-world is\ncommonplace. As such, methods that can ensure a fair learning outcome with\nrespect to all sensitive attributes of concern simultaneously need to be\ndeveloped. In this paper, we study multi-group fairness in machine learning\n(MultiFair), where statistical parity, a representative group fairness measure,\nis guaranteed among demographic groups formed by multiple sensitive attributes\nof interest. We formulate it as a mutual information minimization problem and\npropose a generic end-to-end algorithmic framework to solve it. The key idea is\nto leverage a variational representation of mutual information, which considers\nthe variational distribution between learning outcomes and sensitive\nattributes, as well as the density ratio between the variational and the\noriginal distributions. Our proposed framework is generalizable to many\ndifferent settings, including other statistical notions of fairness, and could\nhandle any type of learning task equipped with a gradient-based optimizer.\nEmpirical evaluations in the fair classification task on three real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively debias the\nclassification results with minimal impact to the classification accuracy.",

In this paper, we show one more application of this kind: the\nalternating fixpoint operator by Knorr et al. for the study of the well-founded\nsemantics for hybrid MKNF knowledge bases is in fact an approximator of AFT in\ndisguise, which, thanks to the power of abstraction of AFT, characterizes not\nonly the well-founded semantics but also two-valued as well as three-valued\nsemantics for hybrid MKNF knowledge bases.

The main reason is that NMT pays excessive\nattention to the partial translation while neglecting the source sentence to\nsome extent, namely overconfidence of the LM.

    "title": "Dissecting Click Fraud Autonomy in the Wild",
    "abstract": "Although the use of pay-per-click mechanisms stimulates the prosperity of the\nmobile advertisement network, fraudulent ad clicks result in huge financial\nlosses for advertisers. Extensive studies identify click fraud according to\nclick/traffic patterns based on dynamic analysis. However, in this study, we\nidentify a novel click fraud, named humanoid attack, which can circumvent\nexisting detection schemes by generating fraudulent clicks with similar\npatterns to normal clicks. We implement the first tool ClickScanner to detect\nhumanoid attacks on Android apps based on static analysis and variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) with limited knowledge of fraudulent examples. We define\nnovel features to characterize the patterns of humanoid attacks in the apps'\nbytecode level. ClickScanner builds a data dependency graph (DDG) based on\nstatic analysis to extract these key features and form a feature vector. We\nthen propose a classification model only trained on benign datasets to overcome\nthe limited knowledge of humanoid attacks.\nWe leverage ClickScanner to conduct the first large-scale measurement on app\nmarkets (i.e.,120,000 apps from Google Play and Huawei AppGallery) and reveal\nseveral unprecedented phenomena. First, even for the top-rated 20,000 apps,\nClickScanner still identifies 157 apps as fraudulent, which shows the\nprevalence of humanoid attacks. Second, it is observed that the ad SDK-based\nattack (i.e., the fraudulent codes are in the third-party ad SDKs) is now a\ndominant attack approach. Third, the manner of attack is notably different\nacross apps of various categories and popularities. Finally, we notice there\nare several existing variants of the humanoid attack. Additionally, our\nmeasurements demonstrate the proposed ClickScanner is accurate and\ntime-efficient (i.e., the detection overhead is only 15.35% of those of\nexisting schemes).",

The randomization in the\nwaveform, which is achieved by using permutations of the sequence of frequency\ntones, is utilized for data transmission.

Considering the\noptimum maximum likelihood (ML) detection, the union bound and the nearest\nneighbour approximation on the communication block error probability is derived\nfor communication in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.

From the\nradar perspective, two key analytical tools, namely, the ambiguity function\n(AF) and the Fisher information matrix are derived.

    "abstract": "As the heart of a search engine, the ranking system plays a crucial role in\nsatisfying users' information demands. More recently, neural rankers fine-tuned\nfrom pre-trained language models (PLMs) establish state-of-the-art ranking\neffectiveness. However, it is nontrivial to directly apply these PLM-based\nrankers to the large-scale web search system due to the following challenging\nissues:(1) the prohibitively expensive computations of massive neural PLMs,\nespecially for long texts in the web-document, prohibit their deployments in an\nonline ranking system that demands extremely low latency;(2) the discrepancy\nbetween existing ranking-agnostic pre-training objectives and the ad-hoc\nretrieval scenarios that demand comprehensive relevance modeling is another\nmain barrier for improving the online ranking system;(3) a real-world search\nengine typically involves a committee of ranking components, and thus the\ncompatibility of the individually fine-tuned ranking model is critical for a\ncooperative ranking system. In this work, we contribute a series of\nsuccessfully applied techniques in tackling these exposed issues when deploying\nthe state-of-the-art Chinese pre-trained language model, i.e., ERNIE, in the\nonline search engine system. We first articulate a novel practice to\ncost-efficiently summarize the web document and contextualize the resultant\nsummary content with the query using a cheap yet powerful Pyramid-ERNIE\narchitecture. Then we endow an innovative paradigm to finely exploit the\nlarge-scale noisy and biased post-click behavioral data for relevance-oriented\npre-training. We also propose a human-anchored fine-tuning strategy tailored\nfor the online ranking system, aiming to stabilize the ranking signals across\nvarious online components.

    "abstract": "In contrast to the oriented bounding boxes, point set representation has\ngreat potential to capture the detailed structure of instances with the\narbitrary orientations, large aspect ratios and dense distribution in aerial\nimages. However, the conventional point set-based approaches are handcrafted\nwith the fixed locations using points-to-points supervision, which hurts their\nflexibility on the fine-grained feature extraction. To address these\nlimitations, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to aerial object\ndetection, named Oriented RepPoints. Specifically, we suggest to employ a set\nof adaptive points to capture the geometric and spatial information of the\narbitrary-oriented objects, which is able to automatically arrange themselves\nover the object in a spatial and semantic scenario. To facilitate the\nsupervised learning, the oriented conversion function is proposed to explicitly\nmap the adaptive point set into an oriented bounding box. Moreover, we\nintroduce an effective quality assessment measure to select the point set\nsamples for training, which can choose the representative items with respect to\ntheir potentials on orientated object detection. Furthermore, we suggest a\nspatial constraint to penalize the outlier points outside the ground-truth\nbounding box. In addition to the traditional evaluation metric mAP focusing on\noverlap ratio, we propose a new metric mAOE to measure the orientation accuracy\nthat is usually neglected in the previous studies on oriented object detection.\nExperiments on three widely used datasets including DOTA, HRSC2016 and UCAS-AOD\ndemonstrate that our proposed approach is effective.",

    "abstract": "Learning discriminative representation using large-scale face datasets in the\nwild is crucial for real-world applications, yet it remains challenging. The\ndifficulties lie in many aspects and this work focus on computing resource\nconstraint and long-tailed class distribution. Recently, classification-based\nrepresentation learning with deep neural networks and well-designed losses have\ndemonstrated good recognition performance. However, the computing and memory\ncost linearly scales up to the number of identities (classes) in the training\nset, and the learning process suffers from unbalanced classes. In this work, we\npropose a dynamic class queue (DCQ) to tackle these two problems. Specifically,\nfor each iteration during training, a subset of classes for recognition are\ndynamically selected and their class weights are dynamically generated\non-the-fly which are stored in a queue. Since only a subset of classes is\nselected for each iteration, the computing requirement is reduced. By using a\nsingle server without model parallel, we empirically verify in large-scale\ndatasets that 10% of classes are sufficient to achieve similar performance as\nusing all classes. Moreover, the class weights are dynamically generated in a\nfew-shot manner and therefore suitable for tail classes with only a few\ninstances. We show clear improvement over a strong baseline in the largest\npublic dataset Megaface Challenge2 (MF2) which has 672K identities and over 88%\nof them have less than 10 instances.

Existing heterogeneous graph learning\nmethods are primarily developed by following the propagation mechanism of node\nrepresentations. There are few efforts on studying the role of relations for\nimproving the learning of more fine-grained node representations. Indeed, it is\nimportant to collaboratively learn the semantic representations of relations\nand discern node representations with respect to different relation types. To\nthis end, in this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph\nNeural Network, namely R-HGNN, to learn node representations on heterogeneous\ngraphs at a fine-grained level by considering relation-aware characteristics.\nSpecifically, a dedicated graph convolution component is first designed to\nlearn unique node representations from each relation-specific graph separately.\nThen, a cross-relation message passing module is developed to improve the\ninteractions of node representations across different relations. Also, the\nrelation representations are learned in a layer-wise manner to capture relation\nsemantics, which are used to guide the node representation learning process.\nMoreover, a semantic fusing module is presented to aggregate relation-aware\nnode representations into a compact representation with the learned relation\nrepresentations.

Upon the generative adversarial\nnetwork, our overall framework consists of a generator and a discriminator. The\nformer predicts importance scores for all frames of a video while the latter\ntries to distinguish the score-weighted frame features from original frame\nfeatures. Specifically, the generator employs a fully convolutional sequence\nnetwork to extract global representation of a video, and an attention-based\nnetwork to output normalized importance scores. To learn the parameters, our\nobjective function is composed of three loss functions, which can guide the\nframe-level importance score prediction collaboratively. To validate this\nproposed method, we have conducted extensive experiments on two public\nbenchmarks SumMe and TVSum.

    "abstract": "Recently, the sequence-to-sequence models have made remarkable progress on\nthe task of keyphrase generation (KG) by concatenating multiple keyphrases in a\npredefined order as a target sequence during training. However, the keyphrases\nare inherently an unordered set rather than an ordered sequence. Imposing a\npredefined order will introduce wrong bias during training, which can highly\npenalize shifts in the order between keyphrases. In this work, we propose a new\ntraining paradigm One2Set without predefining an order to concatenate the\nkeyphrases. To fit this paradigm, we propose a novel model that utilizes a\nfixed set of learned control codes as conditions to generate a set of\nkeyphrases in parallel. To solve the problem that there is no correspondence\nbetween each prediction and target during training, we propose a $K$-step\ntarget assignment mechanism via bipartite matching, which greatly increases the\ndiversity and reduces the duplication ratio of generated keyphrases. The\nexperimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",

Here, we demonstrate a simple yet effective method to\nattack MRC models and reveal the statistical biases in these models. We apply\nthe method to the RACE dataset, for which the answer to each MRC question is\nselected from 4 options. It is found that several pre-trained language models,\nincluding BERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa, show consistent preference to some\noptions, even when these options are irrelevant to the question. When\ninterfered by these irrelevant options, the performance of MRC models can be\nreduced from human-level performance to the chance-level performance.

    "abstract": "Ontological query answering is the problem of answering queries in the\npresence of schema constraints representing the domain of interest. Datalog+/-\nis a common family of languages for schema constraints, including\ntuple-generating dependencies (TGDs) and equality-generating dependencies\n(EGDs). The interplay of TGDs and EGDs leads to undecidability or\nintractability of query answering when adding EGDs to tractable Datalog+/-\nfragments, like Warded Datalog+/-, for which, in the sole presence of TGDs,\nquery answering is PTIME in data complexity. There have been attempts to limit\nthe interaction of TGDs and EGDs and guarantee tractability, in particular with\nthe introduction of separable EGDs, to make EGDs irrelevant for query answering\nas long as the set of constraints is satisfied. While being tractable,\nseparable EGDs have limited expressive power.\nWe propose a more general class of EGDs, which we call ``harmless'', that\nsubsume separable EGDs and allow to model a much broader class of problems.\nUnlike separable EGDs, harmless EGDs, besides enforcing ground equality\nconstraints, specialize the query answer by grounding or renaming the labelled\nnulls introduced by existential quantification in the TGDs. Harmless EGDs\ncapture the cases when the answer obtained in the presence of EGDs is less\ngeneral than the one obtained with TGDs only. We conclude that the theoretical\nproblem of deciding whether a set of constraints contains harmless EGDs is\nundecidable. We contribute a sufficient syntactic condition characterizing\nharmless EGDs, broad and useful in practice. We focus on Warded Datalog+/- with\nharmless EGDs and argue that, in such fragment, query answering is decidable\nand PTIME in data complexity. We study chase-based techniques for query\nanswering in Warded Datalog+/- with harmless EGDs, conducive to an efficient\nalgorithm to be implemented in state-of-the-art reasoners.",

    "abstract": "Sequences of events including infectious disease outbreaks, social network\nactivities, and crimes are ubiquitous and the data on such events carry\nessential information about the underlying diffusion processes between\ncommunities (e.g., regions, online user groups). Modeling diffusion processes\nand predicting future events are crucial in many applications including\nepidemic control, viral marketing, and predictive policing. Hawkes processes\noffer a central tool for modeling the diffusion processes, in which the\ninfluence from the past events is described by the triggering kernel. However,\nthe triggering kernel parameters, which govern how each community is influenced\nby the past events, are assumed to be static over time. In the real world, the\ndiffusion processes depend not only on the influences from the past, but also\nthe current (time-evolving) states of the communities, e.g., people's awareness\nof the disease and people's current interests. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Hawkes process model that is able to capture the underlying dynamics of\ncommunity states behind the diffusion processes and predict the occurrences of\nevents based on the dynamics. Specifically, we model the latent dynamic\nfunction that encodes these hidden dynamics by a mixture of neural networks.\nThen we design the triggering kernel using the latent dynamic function and its\nintegral. The proposed method, termed DHP (Dynamic Hawkes Processes), offers a\nflexible way to learn complex representations of the time-evolving communities'\nstates, while at the same time it allows to computing the exact likelihood,\nwhich makes parameter learning tractable. Extensive experiments on four\nreal-world event datasets show that DHP outperforms five widely adopted methods\nfor event prediction.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have led to breakthroughs in the development\nof automated skin disease classification. As we observe an increasing interest\nin these models in the dermatology space, it is crucial to address aspects such\nas the robustness towards input data distribution shifts. Current skin disease\nmodels could make incorrect inferences for test samples from different hardware\ndevices and clinical settings or unknown disease samples, which are\nout-of-distribution (OOD) from the training samples.To this end, we propose a\nsimple yet effective approach that detect these OOD samples prior to making any\ndecision. The detection is performed via scanning in the latent space\nrepresentation (e.g., activations of the inner layers of any pre-trained skin\ndisease classifier). The input samples could also perturbed to maximise\ndivergence of OOD samples. We validate our ODD detection approach in two use\ncases: 1) identify samples collected from different protocols, and 2) detect\nsamples from unknown disease classes. Additionally, we evaluate the performance\nof the proposed approach and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods.\nFurthermore, data-driven dermatology applications may deepen the disparity in\nclinical care across racial and ethnic groups since most datasets are reported\nto suffer from bias in skin tone distribution. Therefore, we also evaluate the\nfairness of these OOD detection methods across different skin tones. Our\nexperiments resulted in competitive performance across multiple datasets in\ndetecting OOD samples, which could be used (in the future) to design more\neffective transfer learning techniques prior to inferring on these samples.",

Due to gravity differentiation\nin horizontal wells and highly deviated wells (non-vertical wells), the water\nphase at the bottom of the pipeline will cause scaling and corrosion in the\npipeline. Scaling and corrosion will make the transportation process difficult,\nand transportation costs will be considerably increased. Therefore, the study\nof the oil-water two-phase flow pattern is of great importance to oil\nproduction. In this paper, a fuzzy inference system is used to predict the flow\npattern of the fluid, get the prediction result, and compares it with the\nprediction result of the BP neural network. From the comparison of the results,\nwe found that the prediction results of the fuzzy inference system are more\naccurate and reliable than the prediction results of the BP neural network.

    "abstract": "Accurate mapping of oil palm is important for understanding its past and\nfuture impact on the environment. We propose to map and count oil palms by\nestimating tree densities per pixel for large-scale analysis. This allows for\nfine-grained analysis, for example regarding different planting patterns. To\nthat end, we propose a new, active deep learning method to estimate oil palm\ndensity at large scale from Sentinel-2 satellite images, and apply it to\ngenerate complete maps for Malaysia and Indonesia. What makes the regression of\noil palm density challenging is the need for representative reference data that\ncovers all relevant geographical conditions across a large territory.\nSpecifically for density estimation, generating reference data involves\ncounting individual trees. To keep the associated labelling effort low we\npropose an active learning (AL) approach that automatically chooses the most\nrelevant samples to be labelled. Our method relies on estimates of the\nepistemic model uncertainty and of the diversity among samples, making it\npossible to retrieve an entire batch of relevant samples in a single iteration.\nMoreover, our algorithm has linear computational complexity and is easily\nparallelisable to cover large areas. We use our method to compute the first oil\npalm density map with $10\\,$m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) , for all of\nIndonesia and Malaysia and for two different years, 2017 and 2019. The maps\nhave a mean absolute error of $\\pm$7.3 trees/$ha$, estimated from an\nindependent validation set. We also analyse density variations between\ndifferent states within a country and compare them to official estimates.\nAccording to our estimates there are, in total, $>1.2$ billion oil palms in\nIndonesia covering $>$15 million $ha$, and $>0.5$ billion oil palms in Malaysia\ncovering $>6$ million $ha$.",

    "abstract": "We consider a system of several collocated nodes sharing a time slotted\nwireless channel, and seek a MAC that (i) provides low mean delay, (ii) has\ndistributed control (i.e., there is no central scheduler), and (iii) does not\nrequire explicit exchange of state information or control signals. The design\nof such MAC protocols must keep in mind the need for contention access at light\ntraffic, and scheduled access in heavy traffic, leading to the long-standing\ninterest in hybrid, adaptive MACs.\nWe first propose EZMAC, a simple extension of an existing decentralized,\nhybrid MAC called ZMAC. Next, motivated by our results on delay and throughput\noptimality in partially observed, constrained queuing networks, we develop\nanother decentralized MAC protocol that we term QZMAC. A method to improve the\nshort-term fairness of QZMAC is proposed and analysed, and the resulting\nmodified algorithm is shown to possess better fairness properties than QZMAC.\nThe theory developed to reduce delay is also shown to work %with different\ntraffic types (batch arrivals, for example) and even in the presence of\ntransmission errors and fast fading.\nExtensions to handle time critical traffic (alarms, for example) and hidden\nnodes are also discussed. Practical implementation issues, such as handling\nClear Channel Assessment (CCA) errors, are outlined. We implement and\ndemonstrate the performance of QZMAC on a test bed consisting of CC2420 based\nCrossbow telosB motes, running the 6TiSCH communication stack on the Contiki\noperating system over the 2.4GHz ISM band.\nFinally, using simulations, we show that both protocols achieve mean delays\nmuch lower than those achieved by ZMAC, and QZMAC provides mean delays very\nclose to the minimum achievable in this setting, i.e., that of the centralized\ncomplete knowledge scheduler.",

    "abstract": "To tackle the complexity of state-of-the-art electronic systems, silicon\nfoundries continuously shrink the technology nodes and electronic design\nautomation (EDA) vendors offer hierarchical design flows to decompose systems\ninto smaller blocks. However, such a staged design methodology consists of\nvarious levels of abstraction, where margins will be accumulated and result in\ndegradation of the overall design quality. This limits the full use of\ncapabilities of both the technology and EDA tools. In this work, a study of\ndrive granularity of standard cells is performed and an interpolation method is\nproposed for drive option expansion within original cell libraries. These aim\nto investigate how industrial synthesis tools deal with the drive strength\nselection using different granularity sets. In addition, a fully-automated,\nmulti-objective (MO) EDA digital flow is introduced for power, performance,\narea (PPA) optimisation based on drive strength refinement. This\npopulation-based search method better handles the increased difficulty of cell\nselection when using larger logic libraries, producing better optimised\nsolutions than standard tool flow in this case. The achieved experimental\nresults demonstrate how the improved drive granularity cells overall enhance\nthe quality of designs and how a significant improvement in trading off PPA is\nachieved by the MOEDA flow.",

    "abstract": "In computer science, the \"Subset Sum problem\" is a very well known\nNP-complete problem. In this article, we consider its top-k variation - the\n\"Top-k Subset Sums problem\" that has wide application in recommendation\nsystems, where instead of k best objects they require k best subsets of objects\nwith lowest (or highest) overall scores. Given any input set R of n real\nnumbers, and a positive integer k, our target is to generate the k best subsets\n(top-k Subset Sums) of R, whose sum of elements is minimized. The direct\nsolution for this problem is prohibitively expensive since it requires\nenumerating all the possible subsets, which is exponential to the value of n.\nIn this article, our method is based on constructing a metadata structure G for\nn. Each node of G stores a bit vector of size n from which a subset of R can be\nretrieved. We finally show that we do not need to explicitly construct G as a\nwhole, rather to answer a query, we traverse only the required portion of G on\ndemand that obviously helps to bypass the high space requirement of the\npre-processing step.",

    "abstract": "Conformal predictors are an important class of algorithms that allow\npredictions to be made with a user-defined confidence level. They are able to\ndo this by outputting prediction sets, rather than simple point predictions.\nThe conformal predictor is valid in the sense that the accuracy of its\npredictions is guaranteed to meet the confidence level, only assuming\nexchangeability in the data. Since accuracy is guaranteed, the performance of a\nconformal predictor is measured through the efficiency of the prediction sets.\nTypically, a conformal predictor is built on an underlying machine learning\nalgorithm and hence its predictive power is inherited from this algorithm.\nHowever, since the underlying machine learning algorithm is not trained with\nthe objective of minimizing predictive efficiency it means that the resulting\nconformal predictor may be sub-optimal and not aligned sufficiently to this\nobjective. Hence, in this study we consider an approach to train the conformal\npredictor directly with maximum predictive efficiency as the optimization\nobjective, and we focus specifically on the inductive conformal predictor for\nclassification. To do this, the conformal predictor is approximated by a\ndifferentiable objective function and gradient descent used to optimize it. The\nresulting parameter estimates are then passed to a proper inductive conformal\npredictor to give valid prediction sets. We test the method on several real\nworld data sets and find that the method is promising and in most cases gives\nimproved predictive efficiency against a baseline conformal predictor.",

By using additional prompts to fine-tune\nPLMs, we can further stimulate the rich knowledge distributed in PLMs to better\nserve downstream task. Prompt tuning has achieved promising results on some\nfew-class classification tasks such as sentiment classification and natural\nlanguage inference. However, manually designing lots of language prompts is\ncumbersome and fallible. For those auto-generated prompts, it is also expensive\nand time-consuming to verify their effectiveness in non-few-shot scenarios.\nHence, it is challenging for prompt tuning to address many-class classification\ntasks. To this end, we propose prompt tuning with rules (PTR) for many-class\ntext classification, and apply logic rules to construct prompts with several\nsub-prompts. In this way, PTR is able to encode prior knowledge of each class\ninto prompt tuning. We conduct experiments on relation classification, a\ntypical many-class classification task, and the results on benchmarks show that\nPTR can significantly and consistently outperform existing state-of-the-art\nbaselines.

Since the binary linear LRCs can significantly reduce the\ncoding and decoding complexity, the construction of binary LRCs is of\nparticular interest. To date, all the known optimal binary linear LRCs with the\nlocality $2^b$ ($b\\geq 3$) are based on the so-called partial spread which is a\ncollection of the same dimensional subspaces with pairwise trivial, i.e.,\nzero-dimensional intersection.\nIn this paper, we concentrate on binary linear LRCs with disjoint local\nrepair groups.

This method will increase the number of possible repair\ngroups of LRCs as many as possible, and thus efficiently enlarge the range of\nthe construction parameters while keeping the largest code rates compared with\nall known binary linear LRCs with minimum distance $d\\geq 6$ and locality $2^b$\n($b\\geq 3$).",

    "title": "WSSOD: A New Pipeline for Weakly- and Semi-Supervised Object Detection",
    "abstract": "The performance of object detection, to a great extent, depends on the\navailability of large annotated datasets. To alleviate the annotation cost, the\nresearch community has explored a number of ways to exploit unlabeled or weakly\nlabeled data. However, such efforts have met with limited success so far. In\nthis work, we revisit the problem with a pragmatic standpoint, trying to\nexplore a new balance between detection performance and annotation cost by\njointly exploiting fully and weakly annotated data. Specifically, we propose a\nweakly- and semi-supervised object detection framework (WSSOD), which involves\na two-stage learning procedure. An agent detector is first trained on a joint\ndataset and then used to predict pseudo bounding boxes on weakly-annotated\nimages. The underlying assumptions in the current as well as common\nsemi-supervised pipelines are also carefully examined under a unified EM\nformulation. On top of this framework, weakly-supervised loss (WSL), label\nattention and random pseudo-label sampling (RPS) strategies are introduced to\nrelax these assumptions, bringing additional improvement on the efficacy of the\ndetection pipeline. The proposed framework demonstrates remarkable performance\non PASCAL-VOC and MSCOCO benchmark, achieving a high performance comparable to\nthose obtained in fully-supervised settings, with only one third of the\nannotations.",

    "abstract": "Virtual Personal Assistants like Siri have great potential but such\ndevelopments hit the fundamental problem of how to make computational devices\nthat understand human speech. Natural language understanding is one of the more\ndisappointing failures of AI research and it seems there is something we\ncomputer scientists don't get about the nature of language. Of course\nphilosophers and linguists think quite differently about language and this\npaper describes how we have taken ideas from other disciplines and implemented\nthem. The background to the work is to take seriously the notion of language as\naction and look at what people actually do with language using the techniques\nof Conversation Analysis. The observation has been that human communication is\n(behind the scenes) about the management of social relations as well as the\n(foregrounded) passing of information. To claim this is one thing but to\nimplement it requires a mechanism. The mechanism described here is based on the\nnotion of language being intentional - we think intentionally, talk about them\nand recognise them in others - and cooperative in that we are compelled to help\nout. The way we are compelled points to a solution to the ever present problem\nof keeping the human on topic. The approach has led to a recent success in\nwhich we significantly improve user satisfaction independent of task\ncompletion. Talk Markup Language (TalkML) is a draft alternative to VoiceXML\nthat, we propose, greatly simplifies the scripting of interaction by providing\ndefault behaviours for no input and not recognised speech events.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new state representation method, called encoding\nsum and concatenation (ESC), for the state representation of decision-making in\nautonomous driving. Unlike existing state representation methods, ESC is\napplicable to a variable number of surrounding vehicles and eliminates the need\nfor manually pre-designed sorting rules, leading to higher representation\nability and generality. The proposed ESC method introduces a representation\nneural network (NN) to encode each surrounding vehicle into an encoding vector,\nand then adds these vectors to obtain the representation vector of the set of\nsurrounding vehicles. By concatenating the set representation with other\nvariables, such as indicators of the ego vehicle and road, we realize the\nfixed-dimensional and permutation invariant state representation. This paper\nhas further proved that the proposed ESC method can realize the injective\nrepresentation if the output dimension of the representation NN is greater than\nthe number of variables of all surrounding vehicles. This means that by taking\nthe ESC representation as policy inputs, we can find the nearly optimal\nrepresentation NN and policy NN by simultaneously optimizing them using\ngradient-based updating. Experiments demonstrate that compared with the\nfixed-permutation representation method, the proposed method improves the\nrepresentation ability of the surrounding vehicles, and the corresponding\napproximation error is reduced by 62.2%.",

    "abstract": "3D action recognition is referred to as the classification of action\nsequences which consist of 3D skeleton joints. While many research work are\ndevoted to 3D action recognition, it mainly suffers from three problems: highly\ncomplicated articulation, a great amount of noise, and a low implementation\nefficiency. To tackle all these problems, we propose a real-time 3D action\nrecognition framework by integrating the locally aggregated kinematic-guided\nskeletonlet (LAKS) with a supervised hashing-by-analysis (SHA) model. We first\ndefine the skeletonlet as a few combinations of joint offsets grouped in terms\nof kinematic principle, and then represent an action sequence using LAKS, which\nconsists of a denoising phase and a locally aggregating phase. The denoising\nphase detects the noisy action data and adjust it by replacing all the features\nwithin it with the features of the corresponding previous frame, while the\nlocally aggregating phase sums the difference between an offset feature of the\nskeletonlet and its cluster center together over all the offset features of the\nsequence. Finally, the SHA model which combines sparse representation with a\nhashing model, aiming at promoting the recognition accuracy while maintaining a\nhigh efficiency. Experimental results on MSRAction3D, UTKinectAction3D and\nFlorence3DAction datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in both recognition accuracy and implementation\nefficiency.",

Besides geometric information about the mapped environment,\nthe semantics plays an important role to enable intelligent navigation\nbehaviors. In most realistic environments, this task is particularly\ncomplicated due to dynamics caused by moving objects, which can corrupt the\nmapping step or derail localization. In this paper, we propose an extension of\na recently published surfel-based mapping approach exploiting three-dimensional\nlaser range scans by integrating semantic information to facilitate the mapping\nprocess. The semantic information is efficiently extracted by a fully\nconvolutional neural network and rendered on a spherical projection of the\nlaser range data. This computed semantic segmentation results in point-wise\nlabels for the whole scan, allowing us to build a semantically-enriched map\nwith labeled surfels. This semantic map enables us to reliably filter moving\nobjects, but also improve the projective scan matching via semantic\nconstraints. Our experimental evaluation on challenging highways sequences from\nKITTI dataset with very few static structures and a large amount of moving cars\nshows the advantage of our semantic SLAM approach in comparison to a purely\ngeometric, state-of-the-art approach.",

We implement a multi-agent version of feudal hierarchical RL that\nintroduces a command hierarchy where a commander at the higher level sends\norders to multiple agents at the lower level who simply have to learn to follow\nthese orders. We find that breaking the task down in this way allows us to\nsolve a number of non-trivial floorplans that require the coordination of\nmultiple agents much more efficiently than the standard baseline RL algorithms\nwe compare with.

For both cases,\nrespectively, we summarize the commonly adopted methodologies in the\ncorresponding analysis and design, then describe important works in the\nliterature in detail.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the traffic state estimation (TSE) problem using sparse\nobservations from mobile sensors. TSE can be considered a spatiotemporal\ninterpolation problem in which the evolution of traffic variables (e.g.,\nspeed/density) is governed by traffic flow dynamics (e.g., partial differential\nequations). Most existing TSE methods either rely on well-defined physical\ntraffic flow models or require large amounts of simulation data as input to\ntrain machine learning models. Different from previous studies, in this paper\nwe propose a purely data-driven and model-free solution. We consider TSE as a\nspatiotemporal matrix completion/interpolation problem, and apply\nspatiotemporal Hankel delay embedding to transforms the original incomplete\nmatrix to a fourth-order tensor. By imposing a low-rank assumption on this\ntensor structure, we can approximate and characterize both global patterns and\nthe unknown and complex local spatiotemporal dynamics in a data-driven manner.\nWe use the truncated nuclear norm of the spatiotemporal unfolding (i.e., square\nnorm) to approximate the tensor rank and develop an efficient solution\nalgorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The\nproposed framework only involves two hyperparameters -- spatial and temporal\nwindow lengths, which are easy to set given the degree of data sparsity.

    "title": "A Simple Proof of a New Set Disjointness with Applications to Data  Streams",
    "abstract": "The multiplayer promise set disjointness is one of the most widely used\nproblems from communication complexity in applications. In this problem there\nare $k$ players with subsets $S^1, \\ldots, S^k$, each drawn from $\\{1, 2,\n\\ldots, n\\}$, and we are promised that either the sets are (1) pairwise\ndisjoint, or (2) there is a unique element $j$ occurring in all the sets, which\nare otherwise pairwise disjoint. The total communication of solving this\nproblem with constant probability in the blackboard model is $\\Omega(n/k)$.\nWe observe for most applications, it instead suffices to look at what we call\nthe ``mostly'' set disjointness problem, which changes case (2) to say there is\na unique element $j$ occurring in at least half of the sets, and the sets are\notherwise disjoint. This change gives us a much simpler proof of an\n$\\Omega(n/k)$ randomized total communication lower bound, avoiding Hellinger\ndistance and Poincare inequalities. Using this we show several new results for\ndata streams:\n\\begin{itemize} \\item for $\\ell_2$-Heavy Hitters, any $O(1)$-pass streaming\nalgorithm in the insertion-only model for detecting if an $\\eps$-$\\ell_2$-heavy\nhitter exists requires $\\min(\\frac{1}{\\eps^2}\\log \\frac{\\eps^2n}{\\delta},\n\\frac{1}{\\eps}n^{1/2})$ bits of memory, which is optimal up to a $\\log n$\nfactor. For deterministic algorithms and constant $\\eps$, this gives an\n$\\Omega(n^{1/2})$ lower bound, improving the prior $\\Omega(\\log n)$ lower\nbound. We also obtain lower bounds for Zipfian distributions. \\item for\n$\\ell_p$-Estimation, $p > 2$, we show an $O(1)$-pass $\\Omega(n^{1-2/p}\n\\log(1/\\delta))$ bit lower bound for outputting an $O(1)$-approximation with\nprobability $1-\\delta$, in the insertion-only model. This is optimal, and the\nbest previous lower bound was $\\Omega(n^{1-2/p} + \\log(1/\\delta))$.\n\\end{itemize}",

    "title": "Position-Sensing Graph Neural Networks: Proactively Learning Nodes  Relative Positions",
    "abstract": "Most existing graph neural networks (GNNs) learn node embeddings using the\nframework of message passing and aggregation. Such GNNs are incapable of\nlearning relative positions between graph nodes within a graph. To empower GNNs\nwith the awareness of node positions, some nodes are set as anchors. Then,\nusing the distances from a node to the anchors, GNNs can infer relative\npositions between nodes. However, P-GNNs arbitrarily select anchors, leading to\ncompromising position-awareness and feature extraction. To eliminate this\ncompromise, we demonstrate that selecting evenly distributed and asymmetric\nanchors is essential. On the other hand, we show that choosing anchors that can\naggregate embeddings of all the nodes within a graph is NP-hard. Therefore,\ndevising efficient optimal algorithms in a deterministic approach is\npractically not feasible. To ensure position-awareness and bypass\nNP-completeness, we propose Position-Sensing Graph Neural Networks (PSGNNs),\nlearning how to choose anchors in a back-propagatable fashion. Experiments\nverify the effectiveness of PSGNNs against state-of-the-art GNNs, substantially\nimproving performance on various synthetic and real-world graph datasets while\nenjoying stable scalability. Specifically, PSGNNs on average boost AUC more\nthan 14% for pairwise node classification and 18% for link prediction over the\nexisting state-of-the-art position-aware methods.

    "title": "Learning Security Classifiers with Verified Global Robustness Properties",
    "abstract": "Recent works have proposed methods to train classifiers with local robustness\nproperties, which can provably eliminate classes of evasion attacks for most\ninputs, but not all inputs. Since data distribution shift is very common in\nsecurity applications, e.g., often observed for malware detection, local\nrobustness cannot guarantee that the property holds for unseen inputs at the\ntime of deploying the classifier. Therefore, it is more desirable to enforce\nglobal robustness properties that hold for all inputs, which is strictly\nstronger than local robustness.\nIn this paper, we present a framework and tools for training classifiers that\nsatisfy global robustness properties. We define new notions of global\nrobustness that are more suitable for security classifiers. We design a novel\nbooster-fixer training framework to enforce global robustness properties. We\nstructure our classifier as an ensemble of logic rules and design a new\nverifier to verify the properties. In our training algorithm, the booster\nincreases the classifier's capacity, and the fixer enforces verified global\nrobustness properties following counterexample guided inductive synthesis.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the only global robustness property that has\nbeen previously achieved is monotonicity. Several previous works have defined\nglobal robustness properties, but their training techniques failed to achieve\nverified global robustness. In comparison, we show that we can train\nclassifiers to satisfy different global robustness properties for three\nsecurity datasets, and even multiple properties at the same time, with modest\nimpact on the classifier's performance. For example, we train a Twitter spam\naccount classifier to satisfy five global robustness properties, with 5.4%\ndecrease in true positive rate, and 0.1% increase in false positive rate,\ncompared to a baseline XGBoost model that doesn't satisfy any property.",

    "abstract": "Conventional sparse phase retrieval schemes can recover sparse signals from\nthe magnitude of linear measurements only up to a global phase ambiguity. This\nwork proposes a novel approach that instead utilizes the magnitude of affine\nmeasurements to achieve ambiguity-free signal reconstruction. The proposed\nmethod relies on two-stage approach that consists of support identification\nfollowed by the exact recovery of nonzero signal entries. In the noise-free\ncase, perfect support identification using a simple counting rule is guaranteed\nsubject to a mild condition on the signal sparsity, and subsequent exact\nrecovery of the nonzero signal entries can be obtained in closed-form. The\nproposed approach is then extended to two noisy scenarios, namely, sparse noise\n(or outliers) and non-sparse bounded noise. For both cases, perfect support\nidentification is still ensured under mild conditions on the noise model,\nnamely, the support size for sparse outliers and the power of the bounded\nnoise. Under perfect support identification, exact signal recovery can be\nachieved using a simple majority rule for the sparse noise scenario, and\nreconstruction up to a bounded error can be achieved using linear least-squares\n(LS) estimation for the non-sparse bounded noise scenario. The obtained\nanalytic performance guarantee for the latter case also sheds light on the\nconstruction of the sensing matrix and bias vector. In fact, we show that a\nnear optimal performance can be achieved with high probability by the random\ngeneration of the nonzero entries of the sparse sensing matrix and bias vector\naccording to the uniform distribution over a circle.

    "abstract": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) consist of inter-wined computational (cyber) and\nphysical components interacting through sensors and/or actuators. Computational\nelements are networked at every scale and can communicate with each others and\nwith humans. Nodes can join and leave the network at any time or they can move\nto different spatial locations. %operating at multiple spatial and temporal\nscales. In this scenario, monitoring spatial and temporal properties plays a\nkey role in understanding of how complex behaviors can emerge from local and\ndynamic interactions. We propose here the Spatio-Temporal Reach and Escape\nLogic, (STREL), a logic-based formal language designed to express and monitor\nspatio-temporal requirements over the execution of mobile and spatially\ndistributed CPS. STREL considers the physical space in which CPS entities\n(nodes of the graph) are arranged as a weighted graph representing their\ndynamic topological configuration. Both nodes and edges have attributes\nmodelling physical and logical quantities that can evolve over time. STREL\ncombines the Signal Temporal Logic with two spatial modalities reach and escape\nthat operate over the weighted graph. From these basic operators, we can derive\nother important spatial modalities such as everywhere, somewhere and surround.\nWe propose both a qualitative and quantitative semantics based on constraint\nsemirings, an algebraic structure suitable for constraint satisfaction and\noptimisation. We provide an offline monitoring algorithm for STREL and we show\nthe feasibility of our approach with the application to two case studies:\nmonitoring spatio-temporal requirements over a simulated mobile ad-hoc sensor\nnetwork and a simulated epidemic spreading model for COVID19.",

During the cooperation, however, risks of\nconsumer privacy leakage and losses of data control rights arise. To deal with\nthe problems above, a framework to improve the performance of NILM with\nfederated learning (FL) has been set up. In the framework, model weights\ninstead of the local data are shared among utilities. The global model is\ngenerated by weighted averaging the locally-trained model weights to gather the\nlocally-trained model information. Optimal model selection help choose the\nmodel which adapts to the data from different domains best. Experiments show\nthat this proposal improves the performance of local NILM runners. The\nperformance of this framework is close to that of the centrally-trained model\nobtained by the convergent data without privacy protection.",

Hyper-convolutions enable decoupling the kernel\nsize, and hence its receptive field, from the number of learnable parameters.\nIn our experiments, focused on challenging biomedical image segmentation tasks,\nwe demonstrate that replacing regular convolutions with hyper-convolutions\nleads to more efficient architectures that achieve improved accuracy.

    "abstract": "The drug discovery and development process is a long and expensive one,\ncosting over 1 billion USD on average per drug and taking 10-15 years. To\nreduce the high levels of attrition throughout the process, there has been a\ngrowing interest in applying machine learning methodologies to various stages\nof drug discovery process in the recent decade, including at the earliest stage\n- identification of druggable disease genes. In this paper, we have developed a\nnew tensor factorisation model to predict potential drug targets (i.e.,genes or\nproteins) for diseases. We created a three dimensional tensor which consists of\n1,048 targets, 860 diseases and 230,011 evidence attributes and clinical\noutcomes connecting them, using data extracted from the Open Targets and\nPharmaProjects databases. We enriched the data with gene representations\nlearned from a drug discovery-oriented knowledge graph and applied our proposed\nmethod to predict the clinical outcomes for unseen target and dis-ease pairs.\nWe designed three evaluation strategies to measure the prediction performance\nand benchmarked several commonly used machine learning classifiers together\nwith matrix and tensor factorisation methods. The result shows that\nincorporating knowledge graph embeddings significantly improves the prediction\naccuracy and that training tensor factorisation alongside a dense neural\nnetwork outperforms other methods. In summary, our framework combines two\nactively studied machine learning approaches to disease target identification,\ntensor factorisation and knowledge graph representation learning, which could\nbe a promising avenue for further exploration in data-driven drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a method of biologically guided deep learning for\npost-radiation FDG-PET image outcome prediction based on pre-radiation images\nand radiotherapy dose information. Based on the classic reaction-diffusion\nmechanism, a novel biological model was proposed using a partial differential\nequation that incorporates spatial radiation dose distribution as a\npatient-specific treatment information variable. A 7-layer\nencoder-decoder-based convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and\ntrained to learn the proposed biological model. As such, the model could\ngenerate post-radiation FDG-PET image outcome predictions with possible\ntime-series transition from pre-radiotherapy image states to post-radiotherapy\nstates. The proposed method was developed using 64 oropharyngeal patients with\npaired FDG-PET studies before and after 20Gy delivery (2Gy/daily fraction) by\nIMRT. In a two-branch deep learning execution, the proposed CNN learns specific\nterms in the biological model from paired FDG-PET images and spatial dose\ndistribution as in one branch, and the biological model generates post-20Gy\nFDG-PET image prediction in the other branch. The proposed method successfully\ngenerated post-20Gy FDG-PET image outcome prediction with breakdown\nillustrations of biological model components. Time-series FDG-PET image\npredictions were generated to demonstrate the feasibility of disease response\nrendering. The developed biologically guided deep learning method achieved\npost-20Gy FDG-PET image outcome predictions in good agreement with ground-truth\nresults. With break-down biological modeling components, the outcome image\npredictions could be used in adaptive radiotherapy decision-making to optimize\npersonalized plans for the best outcome in the future.",

    "abstract": "Pruning techniques for neural networks with a recurrent architecture, such as\nthe recurrent neural network (RNN), are strongly desired for their application\nto edge-computing devices. However, the recurrent architecture is generally not\nrobust to pruning because even small pruning causes accumulation error and the\ntotal error increases significantly over time. In this paper, we propose an\nappropriate pruning algorithm for RNNs inspired by \"spectral pruning\", and\nprovide the generalization error bounds for compressed RNNs.

The models studied are not inherently parametric in nature.\nRather, our interest in parameters is motivated by parameter uncertainty, as\nreaction rates are typically either measures with limited precision or\nestimated. We aim at detecting toricity and shifted toricity, using a framework\nthat has been recently introduced and studied for the non-parametric case over\nboth the reals and the complex numbers. While toricity requires that the\nvariety specifies a subgroup of the direct power of the multiplicative group of\nthe underlying field, shifted toricity requires only a coset. In the presence\nof parameters, we are not faced with decision problems anymore. Instead, we\nderive necessary and sufficient conditions in the parameters for toricity or\nshifted toricity to hold. Technically, we use real quantifier elimination\nmethods. Our computations on biological networks here once more confirm shifted\ntoricity as a relevant concept, while toricity holds only for degenerate\nparameter choices.",

    "abstract": "Mini-batch sub-sampling (MBSS) is favored in deep neural network training to\nreduce the computational cost. Still, it introduces an inherent sampling error,\nmaking the selection of appropriate learning rates challenging. The sampling\nerrors can manifest either as a bias or variances in a line search. Dynamic\nMBSS re-samples a mini-batch at every function evaluation. Hence, dynamic MBSS\nresults in point-wise discontinuous loss functions with smaller bias but larger\nvariance than static sampled loss functions. However, dynamic MBSS has the\nadvantage of having larger data throughput during training but requires the\ncomplexity regarding discontinuities to be resolved. This study extends the\ngradient-only surrogate (GOS), a line search method using quadratic\napproximation models built with only directional derivative information, for\ndynamic MBSS loss functions. We propose a gradient-only approximation line\nsearch (GOALS) with strong convergence characteristics with defined optimality\ncriterion. We investigate GOALS's performance by applying it on various\noptimizers that include SGD, RMSprop and Adam on ResNet-18 and EfficientNetB0.\nWe also compare GOALS's against the other existing learning rate methods. We\nquantify both the best performing and most robust algorithms. For the latter,\nwe introduce a relative robust criterion that allows us to quantify the\ndifference between an algorithm and the best performing algorithm for a given\nproblem.

Particularly, when only \"single\" noisy images are\navailable for training a denoiser, the denoising performance of existing\nmethods was not satisfactory. Recently, the blind pixelwise affine image\ndenoiser (BP-AIDE) was proposed and significantly improved the performance in\nthe above setting, to the extent that it is competitive with denoisers which\nutilized additional information. However, BP-AIDE seriously suffered from slow\ninference time due to the inefficiency of noise level estimation procedure and\nthat of the blind-spot network (BSN) architecture it used. To that end, we\npropose Fast Blind Image Denoiser (FBI-Denoiser) for Poisson-Gaussian noise,\nwhich consists of two neural network models; 1) PGE-Net that estimates\nPoisson-Gaussian noise parameters 2000 times faster than the conventional\nmethods and 2) FBI-Net that realizes a much more efficient BSN for pixelwise\naffine denoiser in terms of the number of parameters and inference speed.\nConsequently, we show that our FBI-Denoiser blindly trained solely based on\nsingle noisy images can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several\nreal-world noisy image benchmark datasets with much faster inference time (x\n10), compared to BP-AIDE.

The\naccuracy of these systems is limited since deep learning neural networks such\nas CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) need a significantly large quantity of\ndata for training in order to produce good quality results. Since the disease\nis relatively recent and more focus has been on CXR (Chest XRay) images, the\navailable chest CT Scan image dataset is much less. We propose a method, by\nutilizing GANs, to generate synthetic chest CT images of both positive and\nnegative COVID-19 patients. Using a pre-built predictive model, we concluded\nthat around 40% of the generated images are correctly predicted as COVID-19\npositive. The dataset thus generated can be used to train a CNN-based\nclassifier which can help determine COVID-19 in a patient with greater\naccuracy.",

Existing\napproaches either downsample original images, or approximate underlying\ntransformations, or reduce model size. The information loss during the\napproximation or insufficient model capacity is a hindrance to the registration\naccuracy for high-dimensional images, e.g., 3D medical volumes. In this paper,\nwe propose a Dividing and Downsampling mixed Registration network (DDR-Net), a\ngeneral architecture that preserves most of the image information at multiple\nscales. DDR-Net leverages the global context via downsampling the input and\nutilizes the local details from divided chunks of the input images. This design\nreduces the network input size and its memory cost; meanwhile, by fusing global\nand local information, DDR-Net obtains both coarse-level and fine-level\nalignments in the final deformation fields. We evaluate DDR-Net on three public\ndatasets, i.e., OASIS, IBSR18, and 3DIRCADB-01, and the experimental results\ndemonstrate our approach outperforms existing approaches.",

We use accessible\nfeatures of the equities pricing data to construct a non-deterministic Markov\ndecision process for modeling stock price behavior driven by principal\ninvestor's decision making. However, low signal-to-noise ratio and instability\nthat appear immanent in equity markets pose challenges to determine the state\ntransition (price change) after executing an action (principal investor's\ndecision) as well as decide an action based on current state (spot price). In\norder to conquer these challenges, we resort to a Bayesian deep neural network\nfor computing the predictive distribution of the state transition led by an\naction. Additionally, instead of exploring a state-action relationship to\nformulate a policy, we seek for an episode based visible-hidden state-action\nrelationship to probabilistically imitate principal investor's successive\ndecision making. Our algorithm then maps imitative principal investor's\ndecisions to simulated stock price paths by a Bayesian deep neural network.\nEventually the optimal option price is reinforcement learned through maximizing\nthe cumulative risk-adjusted return of a dynamically hedged portfolio over\nsimulated price paths of the underlying.",

    "abstract": "Satisfiability of boolean formulae (SAT) has been a topic of research in\nlogic and computer science for a long time. In this paper we are interested in\nunderstanding the structure of satisfiable and unsatisfiable sentences. In\nprevious work we initiated a new approach to SAT by formulating a mapping from\npropositional logic sentences to graphs, allowing us to find structural\nobstructions to 2SAT (clauses with exactly 2 literals) in terms of graphs. Here\nwe generalize these ideas to multi-hypergraphs in which the edges can have more\nthan 2 vertices and can have multiplicity. This is needed for understanding the\nstructure of SAT for sentences made of clauses with 3 or more literals (3SAT),\nwhich is a building block of NP-completeness theory. We introduce a decision\nproblem that we call GraphSAT, as a first step towards a structural view of\nSAT. Each propositional logic sentence can be mapped to a multi-hypergraph by\nassociating each variable with a vertex (ignoring the negations) and each\nclause with a hyperedge. Such a graph then becomes a representative of a\ncollection of possible sentences and we can then formulate the notion of\nsatisfiability of such a graph. With this coarse representation of classes of\nsentences one can then investigate structural obstructions to SAT. To make the\nproblem tractable, we prove a local graph rewriting theorem which allows us to\nsimplify the neighborhood of a vertex without knowing the rest of the graph. We\nuse this to deduce several reduction rules, allowing us to modify a graph\nwithout changing its satisfiability status which can then be used in a program\nto simplify graphs. We study a subclass of 3SAT by examining sentences living\non triangulations of surfaces and show that for any compact surface there\nexists a triangulation that can support unsatisfiable sentences, giving\nspecific examples of such triangulations for various surfaces.",

Most available kinetic models were built upon expert knowledge, which\nrequires chemical insights and years of experience. This work presents a\nframework for autonomously discovering biomass pyrolysis kinetic models from\nthermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) experimental data using the recently developed\nchemical reaction neural networks (CRNN). The approach incorporated the CRNN\nmodel into the framework of neural ordinary differential equations to predict\nthe residual mass in TGA data. In addition to the flexibility of\nneural-network-based models, the learned CRNN model is fully interpretable, by\nincorporating the fundamental physics laws, such as the law of mass action and\nArrhenius law, into the neural network structure. The learned CRNN model can\nthen be translated into the classical forms of biomass chemical kinetic models,\nwhich facilitates the extraction of chemical insights and the integration of\nthe kinetic model into large-scale fire simulations. We demonstrated the\neffectiveness of the framework in predicting the pyrolysis and oxidation of\ncellulose. This successful demonstration opens the possibility of rapid and\nautonomous chemical kinetic modeling of solid fuels, such as wildfire fuels and\nindustrial polymers.",

Its arrows are functions from source nodes to target nodes\nthat preserve the additional structure. For instance, a game's information-set\ncollection is newly regarded as a topological basis for the game's\ndecision-node set, and thus a morphism's continuity serves to preserve\ninformation sets. Given these definitions, a game monomorphism is characterized\nby the property of not mapping two source runs (plays) to the same target run.\nFurther, a game isomorphism is characterized as a bijection whose restriction\nto decision nodes is a homeomorphism, whose induced player transformation is\ninjective, and which strictly preserves the ordinal content of the utility\nfunctions.\nThe category is then applied to some game-theoretic concepts beyond the\ndefinition of a game. A Selten subgame is characterized as a special kind of\ncategorical subgame, and game isomorphisms are shown to preserve strategy sets,\nNash equilibria, Selten subgames, subgame-perfect equilibria,\nperfect-information, and no-absentmindedness.

The general diagnosis methods for tuberculosis include\nmicroscopic examination, tuberculin skin test, culture method, enzyme linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) and electronic nose system.

In microscopy, the technician examines field of\nviews (FOVs) in sputum smear for presence of any TB bacilli and counts the\nnumber of TB bacilli per FOV to report the level of severity. This process is\ntime consuming with an increased concentration for an experienced staff to\nexamine a single sputum smear.
