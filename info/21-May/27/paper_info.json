    "abstract": "Distance geometry problem belongs to a class of hard problems in classical\ncomputation that can be understood in terms of a set of inputs processed\naccording to a given transformation, and for which the number of possible\noutcomes grows exponentially with the number of inputs. It is conjectured that\nquantum computing schemes can solve problems belonging to this class in a time\nthat grows only at a polynomial rate with the number of inputs. While quantum\ncomputers are still being developed, there are some classical optics\ncomputation approaches that can perform very well for specific tasks. Here, we\npresent an optical computing approach for the distance geometry problem in one\ndimension and show that it is very promising in the classical computing regime.",

    "abstract": "The configuration model is a standard tool for generating random graphs with\na specified degree sequence, and is often used as a null model to evaluate how\nmuch of an observed network's structure is explained by its degrees alone.\nExcept for networks with both self-loops and multi-edges, we lack a direct\nsampling algorithm for the configuration model, e.g., for simple graphs. A\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, based on a degree-preserving\ndouble-edge swap, provides an asymptotic solution to sample from the\nconfiguration model without bias. However, accurately detecting convergence of\nthis Markov chain on its stationary distribution remains an unsolved problem.\nHere, we provide a concrete solution to detect convergence and sample from the\nconfiguration model without bias. We first develop an algorithm for estimating\na sufficient gap between sampled MCMC states for them to be effectively\nindependent. Applying this algorithm to a corpus of 509 empirical networks, we\nderive a set of computationally efficient heuristics, based on scaling laws,\nfor choosing this sampling gap automatically. We then construct a convergence\ndetection method that applies a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to sequences of network\nassortativity values derived from the Markov chain's sampled states. Comparing\nthis test to three generic Markov chain convergence diagnostics, we find that\nour method is both more accurate and more efficient at detecting convergence.",

Given that regression is a fundamental form of deep\nlearning and accounts for a large part of current artificial intelligence\napplications, we demonstrate a silicon-based optical coherent dot-product chip\n(OCDC) capable of completing deep learning regression tasks.

Hardware\ndeviations are compensated via in-situ backpropagation control owing to the\nsimplicity of chip architecture, thus enhancing the numerical accuracy of\nanalog computing. Therefore, the OCDC meets the fundamental requirement for\nregression tasks and we successfully demonstrate a representative neural\nnetwork, the AUTOMAP (a cutting-edge neural network model for image\nreconstruction). The quality of reconstructed images by the OCDC and a 32-bit\ndigital computer is comparable. To best of our knowledge, there is no precedent\nof performing such state-of-the-art regression tasks on ONN chip.

    "abstract": "In self-driving, standalone GPS is generally considered to have insufficient\npositioning accuracy to stay in lane. Instead, many turn to LIDAR localization,\nbut this comes at the expense of building LIDAR maps that can be costly to\nmaintain. Another possibility is to use semantic cues such as lane lines and\ntraffic lights to achieve localization, but these are usually not continuously\nvisible. This issue can be remedied by combining semantic cues with GPS to fill\nin the gaps. However, due to elapsed time between mapping and localization, the\nlive GPS frame can be offset from the semantic map frame, requiring\ncalibration. In this paper, we propose a robust semantic localization algorithm\nthat self-calibrates for the offset between the live GPS and semantic map\nframes by exploiting common semantic cues, including traffic lights and lane\nmarkings. We formulate the problem using a modified Iterated Extended Kalman\nFilter, which incorporates GPS and camera images for semantic cue detection via\nConvolutional Neural Networks.

This paper\npostulates that the root causes of bias are the prior decisions that affect-\n(a) what data was selected and (b) the labels assigned to those examples. Our\nFair-SMOTE algorithm removes biased labels; and rebalances internal\ndistributions such that based on sensitive attribute, examples are equal in\nboth positive and negative classes. On testing, it was seen that this method\nwas just as effective at reducing bias as prior approaches. Further, models\ngenerated via Fair-SMOTE achieve higher performance (measured in terms of\nrecall and F1) than other state-of-the-art fairness improvement algorithms. To\nthe best of our knowledge, measured in terms of number of analyzed learners and\ndatasets, this study is one of the largest studies on bias mitigation yet\npresented in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent behaviour in the physical world exhibits structure at multiple\nspatial and temporal scales. Although movements are ultimately executed at the\nlevel of instantaneous muscle tensions or joint torques, they must be selected\nto serve goals defined on much longer timescales, and in terms of relations\nthat extend far beyond the body itself, ultimately involving coordination with\nother agents. Recent research in artificial intelligence has shown the promise\nof learning-based approaches to the respective problems of complex movement,\nlonger-term planning and multi-agent coordination. However, there is limited\nresearch aimed at their integration. We study this problem by training teams of\nphysically simulated humanoid avatars to play football in a realistic virtual\nenvironment. We develop a method that combines imitation learning, single- and\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning and population-based training, and makes use\nof transferable representations of behaviour for decision making at different\nlevels of abstraction. In a sequence of stages, players first learn to control\na fully articulated body to perform realistic, human-like movements such as\nrunning and turning; they then acquire mid-level football skills such as\ndribbling and shooting; finally, they develop awareness of others and play as a\nteam, bridging the gap between low-level motor control at a timescale of\nmilliseconds, and coordinated goal-directed behaviour as a team at the\ntimescale of tens of seconds. We investigate the emergence of behaviours at\ndifferent levels of abstraction, as well as the representations that underlie\nthese behaviours using several analysis techniques, including statistics from\nreal-world sports analytics. Our work constitutes a complete demonstration of\nintegrated decision-making at multiple scales in a physically embodied\nmulti-agent setting. See project video at https://youtu.be/KHMwq9pv7mg.",

So far, none of the\nvisualization systems has yet managed to examine all the facets of the\nTransformers. This gave us the motivation of the current work. We propose a new\nNLP Transformer context-sensitive visualization method that leverages existing\nNLP tools to find the most significant groups of tokens (words) that have the\ngreatest effect on the output, thus preserving some context from the original\ntext. First, we use a sentence-level dependency parser to highlight promising\nword groups. The dependency parser creates a tree of relationships between the\nwords in the sentence. Next, we systematically remove adjacent and non-adjacent\ntuples of \\emph{n} tokens from the input text, producing several new texts with\nthose tokens missing. The resulting texts are then passed to a pre-trained BERT\nmodel. The classification output is compared with that of the full text, and\nthe difference in the activation strength is recorded. The modified texts that\nproduce the largest difference in the target classification output neuron are\nselected, and the combination of removed words are then considered to be the\nmost influential on the model's output. Finally, the most influential word\ncombinations are visualized in a heatmap.",

Indeed, it is common practice in\nreinforcement learning to simply modify reward functions by penalizing\nfailures, with the penalty treated as a mere heuristic. We rigorously examine\nthis relationship, and formalize the requirements for safe value functions:\nvalue functions that are both optimal for a given task, and enforce safety. We\nreveal the structure of this relationship through a proof of strong duality,\nshowing that there always exists a finite penalty that induces a safe value\nfunction. This penalty is not unique, but upper-unbounded: larger penalties do\nnot harm optimality. Although it is often not possible to compute the minimum\nrequired penalty, we reveal clear structure of how the penalty, rewards,\ndiscount factor, and dynamics interact.

Graphical models, such\nas Bayesian networks, are used for adaptive tests as they allow to model the\nuncertainty about the questions and the skills in an explainable fashion,\nespecially when coping with multiple skills. A better elicitation of the\nuncertainty in the question/skills relations can be achieved by interval\nprobabilities.

In many\napplications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however,\ncomputing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost.\nIn this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a\nbinary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast\ncomputation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning\nprocess. Instead of attempting to transform diagrams into vectorized\nrepresentations, we hash diagrams into binary codes, which have natural\nadvantages in large-scale tasks. The training of this model is domain-oblivious\nin that it can be computed purely from synthetic, randomly created diagrams. As\na consequence, our proposed method is directly applicable to various datasets\nwithout the need of retraining the model. These binary codes, when compared\nusing fast Hamming distance, better maintain topological similarity properties\nbetween datasets than other vectorized representations. To evaluate this\nmethod, we apply our framework to the problem of diagram clustering and we\ncompare the quality and performance of our approach to the state-of-the-art.

    "title": "The Nonlinearity Coefficient -- A Practical Guide to Neural Architecture  Design",
    "abstract": "In essence, a neural network is an arbitrary differentiable, parametrized\nfunction. Choosing a neural network architecture for any task is as complex as\nsearching the space of those functions. For the last few years, 'neural\narchitecture design' has been largely synonymous with 'neural architecture\nsearch' (NAS), i.e. brute-force, large-scale search. NAS has yielded\nsignificant gains on practical tasks. However, NAS methods end up searching for\na local optimum in architecture space in a small neighborhood around\narchitectures that often go back decades, based on CNN or LSTM.\nIn this work, we present a different and complementary approach to\narchitecture design, which we term 'zero-shot architecture design' (ZSAD). We\ndevelop methods that can predict, without any training, whether an architecture\nwill achieve a relatively high test or training error on a task after training.\nWe then go on to explain the error in terms of the architecture definition\nitself and develop tools for modifying the architecture based on this\nexplanation. This confers an unprecedented level of control on the deep\nlearning practitioner. They can make informed design decisions before the first\nline of code is written, even for tasks for which no prior art exists.\nOur first major contribution is to show that the 'degree of nonlinearity' of\na neural architecture is a key causal driver behind its performance, and a\nprimary aspect of the architecture's model complexity. We introduce the\n'nonlinearity coefficient' (NLC), a scalar metric for measuring nonlinearity.\nVia extensive empirical study, we show that the value of the NLC in the\narchitecture's randomly initialized state before training is a powerful\npredictor of test error after training and that attaining a right-sized NLC is\nessential for attaining an optimal test error. The NLC is also conceptually\nsimple, well-defined for any feedforward network, easy and cheap to compute,\nhas extensive theoretical, empirical and conceptual grounding, follows\ninstructively from the architecture definition, and can be easily controlled\nvia our 'nonlinearity normalization' algorithm. We argue that the NLC is the\nmost powerful scalar statistic for architecture design specifically and neural\nnetwork analysis in general. Our analysis is fueled by mean field theory, which\nwe use to uncover the 'meta-distribution' of layers.\nBeyond the NLC, we uncover and flesh out a range of metrics and properties\nthat have a significant explanatory influence on test and training error. We go\non to explain the majority of the error variation across a wide range of\nrandomly generated architectures with these metrics and properties. We compile\nour insights into a practical guide for architecture designers, which we argue\ncan significantly shorten the trial-and-error phase of deep learning\ndeployment.\nOur results are grounded in an experimental protocol that exceeds that of the\nvast majority of other deep learning studies in terms of carefulness and rigor.\nWe study the impact of e.g. dataset, learning rate, floating-point precision,\nloss function, statistical estimation error and batch inter-dependency on\nperformance and other key properties. We promote research practices that we\nbelieve can significantly accelerate progress in architecture design research.",

In this work, we consider variations on\nthe current intensities running through the external coils as the dominant\nsource of uncertainty. This leads to a parameter space of dimension equal to\nthe number of coils in the reactor. With the aid of a surrogate function built\non a sparse grid in parameter space, a Monte Carlo strategy is used to explore\nthe effect that stochasticity in the parameters has on important features of\nthe plasma boundary such as the location of the x-point, the strike points, and\nshaping attributes such as triangularity and elongation.

    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates a new class of security vulnerabilities due to the\nMicro-Op Caches, also called Decode Stream Buffer, and other components in the\nprocessor frontend. The vulnerabilities presented in this work exploit multiple\npaths in the processor frontend that the micro-ops can take: through the\nMicro-Instruction Translation Engine (MITE), through the Decode Stream Buffer\n(DSB), or through the Loop Stream Detector (LSD). Each path has its own unique\ntiming and power signature, which leads to security vulnerabilities. The\nvulnerabilities can be used as side or covert channels for information leakage\nand can be exploited to create both timing and power attacks. As information\nleakage channels, the new vulnerabilities are orthogonal to the existing\nspeculative execution attacks and can be used as covert transmission channels\nin a new variant of speculative attacks that is demonstrated in this work. The\nvulnerabilities further affect Intel SGX enclaves, and this work shows how\ninformation can be leaked from SGX enclaves through the sharing of the frontend\npaths. The transmission rates for new attacks based on the vulnerabilities\npresented can be as high as 1410 Kbps (1.41 Mbps) with an almost 0% error rate.\nConsequently, this work demonstrates that multiple paths in the processor\nfrontend are a source of security vulnerabilities which have not been\nconsidered before and that focusing on just speculative execution attacks is\nnot sufficient to secure today's processors.",

The estimation of quantiles from sample data has a more\nthan a century long tradition and we provide three different distribution-free\nfinite sample guarantees for a class of quantile estimators. The first\nguarantee is based on the Dworetzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality, the second\nguarantee utilizes Chebyshev's inequality, and the third guarantee is based on\nexact confidence intervals for a binomial distribution.

Licensed network such as LTE also comes to\nthe unlicensed spectrum for better providing high-capacity contents with low\ncost. However, LTE was not designed for sharing spectrum with others. A\ncooperation center for these networks is costly because they possess\nheterogeneous properties and everyone can enter and leave the spectrum\nunrestrictedly, so the design will be challenging. Since it is infeasible to\nincorporate potentially infinite scenarios with one unified design, an\nalternative solution is to let each network learn its own coexistence policy.\nPrevious solutions only work on fixed scenarios. In this work a reinforcement\nlearning algorithm is presented to cope with the coexistence between Wi-Fi and\nLTE-LAA agents in 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum. The coexistence problem was\nmodeled as a Dec-POMDP and Bayesian approach was adopted for policy learning\nwith nonparametric prior to accommodate the uncertainty of policy for different\nagents. A fairness measure was introduced in the reward function to encourage\nfair sharing between agents. The reinforcement learning was turned into an\noptimization problem by transforming the value function as likelihood and\nvariational inference for posterior approximation.

In this work, we consider using offline experience datasets -\npotentially far from the target distribution - to learn low-dimensional state\nrepresentations that provably accelerate the sample-efficiency of downstream\nimitation learning. A central challenge in this setting is that the unknown\ntarget policy itself may not exhibit low-dimensional behavior, and so there is\na potential for the representation learning objective to alias states in which\nthe target policy acts differently. Circumventing this challenge, we derive a\nrepresentation learning objective which provides an upper bound on the\nperformance difference between the target policy and a lowdimensional policy\ntrained with max-likelihood, and this bound is tight regardless of whether the\ntarget policy itself exhibits low-dimensional structure.

    "abstract": "Teaching an anthropomorphic robot from human example offers the opportunity\nto impart humanlike qualities on its movement. In this work we present a\nreinforcement learning based method for teaching a real world bipedal robot to\nperform movements directly from human motion capture data. Our method\nseamlessly transitions from training in a simulation environment to executing\non a physical robot without requiring any real world training iterations or\noffline steps. To overcome the disparity in joint configurations between the\nrobot and the motion capture actor, our method incorporates motion re-targeting\ninto the training process. Domain randomization techniques are used to\ncompensate for the differences between the simulated and physical systems. We\ndemonstrate our method on an internally developed humanoid robot with movements\nranging from a dynamic walk cycle to complex balancing and waving. Our\ncontroller preserves the style imparted by the motion capture data and exhibits\ngraceful failure modes resulting in safe operation for the robot.

    "abstract": "Blockchain has received tremendous attention as a secure, distributed, and\nanonymous framework for the Internet of Things (IoT). As a distributed system,\nblockchain trades off scalability for distribution, which limits the\ntechnologys adaptation for large scale networks such as IoT. All transactions\nand blocks must be broadcast and verified by all participants which limits\nscalability and incurs computational and communication overheads. The existing\nsolutions to scale blockchains have so far led to partial recentralization,\nlimiting the technologys original appeal. In this paper, we introduce a\ndistributed yet scalable Verification and Communication architecture for\nblockchain referred to as Vericom. Vericom concurrently achieves high\nscalability and distribution using hash function outputs to shift blockchains\nfrom broadcast to multicast communication. Unlike conventional blockchains\nwhere all nodes must verify new transactions/blocks, Vericom uses the hash of\nIoT traffic to randomly select a set of nodes to verify transactions/blocks\nwhich in turn reduces the processing overhead. Vericom incorporates two layers:\ni) transmission layer where a randomized multicasting method is introduced\nalong with a backbone network to route traffic, i.e., transactions and blocks,\nfrom the source to the destination, and ii) verification layer where a set of\nrandomly selected nodes are allocated to verify each transaction or block. The\nperformance evaluation shows that Vericom reduces the packet and processing\noverhead as compared with conventional blockchains. In the worst case, packet\noverhead in Vericom scales linearly with the number of nodes while the\nprocessing overhead remains scale-independent.",

Successful navigation by these systems requires a good localization\nsystem. Kalman filter based localization techniques have been prevalent since\nthe early 1960s and extensive research has been carried out using them, both in\ndevelopment and in design. It has been found that the use of a dynamic model\n(instead of a kinematic model) in the Kalman filter can lead to more accurate\npredictions, as the dynamic model takes the forces acting on the AUV into\naccount.

In addition, they are hardly able to control\nthe degree of makeup during transferring or to transfer a specified part in the\ninput face. In this work, we propose the PSGAN++, which is capable of\nperforming both detail-preserving makeup transfer and effective makeup removal.\nFor makeup transfer, PSGAN++ uses a Makeup Distill Network to extract makeup\ninformation, which is embedded into spatial-aware makeup matrices. We also\ndevise an Attentive Makeup Morphing module that specifies how the makeup in the\nsource image is morphed from the reference image, and a makeup detail loss to\nsupervise the model within the selected makeup detail area. On the other hand,\nfor makeup removal, PSGAN++ applies an Identity Distill Network to embed the\nidentity information from with-makeup images into identity matrices. Finally,\nthe obtained makeup/identity matrices are fed to a Style Transfer Network that\nis able to edit the feature maps to achieve makeup transfer or removal. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of our PSGAN++, we collect a Makeup Transfer In the\nWild dataset that contains images with diverse poses and expressions and a\nMakeup Transfer High-Resolution dataset that contains high-resolution images.\nExperiments demonstrate that PSGAN++ not only achieves state-of-the-art results\nwith fine makeup details even in cases of large pose/expression differences but\nalso can perform partial or degree-controllable makeup transfer.",

CFR solves games by travsersing the full game tree iteratively,\nwhich limits its scalability in larger games. When applying CFR to solve\nlarge-scale games in previously, large-scale games are abstracted into\nsmall-scale games firstly. Secondly, CFR is used to solve the abstract game.\nAnd finally, the solution strategy is mapped back to the original large-scale\ngame. However, this process requires considerable expert knowledge, and the\naccuracy of abstraction is closely related to expert knowledge. In addition,\nthe abstraction also loses certain information, which will eventually affect\nthe accuracy of the solution strategy.

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a simple end-to-end trainable machine learning\nsystem capable of realistically simulating driving experiences. This can be\nused for the verification of self-driving system performance without relying on\nexpensive and time-consuming road testing. In particular, we frame the\nsimulation problem as a Markov Process, leveraging deep neural networks to\nmodel both state distribution and transition function. These are trainable\ndirectly from the existing raw observations without the need for any\nhandcrafting in the form of plant or kinematic models. All that is needed is a\ndataset of historical traffic episodes. Our formulation allows the system to\nconstruct never seen scenes that unfold realistically reacting to the\nself-driving car's behaviour. We train our system directly from 1,000 hours of\ndriving logs and measure both realism, reactivity of the simulation as the two\nkey properties of the simulation. At the same time, we apply the method to\nevaluate the performance of a recently proposed state-of-the-art ML planning\nsystem trained from human driving logs. We discover this planning system is\nprone to previously unreported causal confusion issues that are difficult to\ntest by non-reactive simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work that directly merges highly realistic data-driven simulations with a\nclosed-loop evaluation for self-driving vehicles. We make the data, code, and\npre-trained models publicly available to further stimulate simulation\ndevelopment.",

    "abstract": "We investigate what grade of sensor data is required for training an\nimitation-learning-based AV planner on human expert demonstration.\nMachine-learned planners are very hungry for training data, which is usually\ncollected using vehicles equipped with the same sensors used for autonomous\noperation. This is costly and non-scalable. If cheaper sensors could be used\nfor collection instead, data availability would go up, which is crucial in a\nfield where data volume requirements are large and availability is small. We\npresent experiments using up to 1000 hours worth of expert demonstration and\nfind that training with 10x lower-quality data outperforms 1x AV-grade data in\nterms of planner performance. The important implication of this is that cheaper\nsensors can indeed be used. This serves to improve data access and democratize\nthe field of imitation-based motion planning. Alongside this, we perform a\nsensitivity analysis of planner performance as a function of perception range,\nfield-of-view, accuracy, and data volume, and the reason why lower-quality data\nstill provide good planning results.",

In this\nwork, we propose a selective encryption (SE) algorithm to protect CNN models\nfrom unauthorized access, with a unique feature of providing hierarchical\nservices to users. Our algorithm firstly selects important model parameters via\nthe proposed Probabilistic Selection Strategy (PSS). It then encrypts the most\nimportant parameters with the designed encryption method called Distribution\nPreserving Random Mask (DPRM), so as to maximize the performance degradation by\nencrypting only a very small portion of model parameters. We also design a set\nof access permissions, using which different amounts of the most important\nmodel parameters can be decrypted. Hence, different levels of model performance\ncan be naturally provided for users. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed scheme could effectively protect the classification model VGG19 by\nmerely encrypting 8% parameters of convolutional layers.

    "abstract": "Fairness is an important property in data-mining applications, including\nrecommender systems. In this work, we investigate a case where users of a\nrecommender system need (or want) to be fair to a protected group of items. For\nexample, in a job market, the user is the recruiter, an item is the job seeker,\nand the protected attribute is gender or race. Even if recruiters want to use a\nfair talent recommender system, the platform may not provide a fair recommender\nsystem, or recruiters may not be able to ascertain whether the recommender\nsystem's algorithm is fair. In this case, recruiters cannot utilize the\nrecommender system, or they may become unfair to job seekers. In this work, we\npropose methods to enable the users to build their own fair recommender\nsystems. Our methods can generate fair recommendations even when the platform\ndoes not (or cannot) provide fair recommender systems. The key challenge is\nthat a user does not have access to the log data of other users or the latent\nrepresentations of items. This restriction prohibits us from adopting existing\nmethods, which are designed for platforms. The main idea is that a user has\naccess to unfair recommendations provided by the platform.

However, current ReID approaches suffer from considerable performance\ndegradation when the test target domains exhibit different characteristics from\nthe training ones, known as the domain shift problem.

Specifically, the\nMD-ExCo consists of a universal expert and several domain experts. Each domain\nexpert focuses on learning from a specific domain, and periodically\ncommunicates with other domain experts to regulate its learning strategy in the\nmeta-learning manner to avoid overfitting. Besides, the universal expert\ngathers knowledge from the domain experts, and also provides supervision to\nthem as feedback.

For these reasons,\nstate-of-the-art methods cannot scale to real-world applications, such as\nrecommender systems.

    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of autonomous object classification and semantic\nSLAM, which in general exhibits a tight coupling between classification, metric\nSLAM and planning under uncertainty. We contribute a unified framework for\ninference and belief space planning (BSP) that addresses prominent sources of\nuncertainty in this context: classification aliasing (classier cannot\ndistinguish between candidate classes from certain viewpoints), classifier\nepistemic uncertainty (classifier receives data \"far\" from its training set),\nand localization uncertainty (camera and object poses are uncertain).\nSpecifically, we develop two methods for maintaining a joint distribution over\nrobot and object poses, and over posterior class probability vector that\nconsiders epistemic uncertainty in a Bayesian fashion. The first approach is\nMulti-Hybrid (MH), where multiple hybrid beliefs over poses and classes are\nmaintained to approximate the joint belief over poses and posterior class\nprobability. The second approach is Joint Lambda Pose (JLP), where the joint\nbelief is maintained directly using a novel JLP factor. Furthermore, we extend\nboth methods to BSP, planning while reasoning about future posterior epistemic\nuncertainty indirectly, or directly via a novel information-theoretic reward\nfunction. Both inference methods utilize a novel viewpoint-dependent classifier\nuncertainty model that leverages the coupling between poses and classification\nscores and predicts the epistemic uncertainty from certain viewpoints. In\naddition, this model is used to generate predicted measurements during\nplanning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that reasons\nabout classifier epistemic uncertainty within semantic SLAM and BSP.",

To enhance the URLLC performance, the\nusers are divided into different groups and the messages for users in each\ngroup are encoded into a single codeword. By considering the time division\nmultiple access (TDMA) protocol among different groups, our objective is to\nminimize the total latency for all users subject to their individual\nreliability requirements, via jointly optimizing the user grouping and\nblock-length allocation at the BS together with the reflective beamforming at\nthe IRS. We solve the latency minimization problem via the alternating\noptimization, in which the blocklengths and the reflective beamforming are\noptimized by using the techniques of successive convex approximation (SCA) and\nsemi-definite relaxation (SDR), while the user grouping is updated by K-means\nand greedy-based methods. Numerical results show that the proposed designs can\nsignificantly reduce the communication latency, as compared to various\nbenchmark schemes, which unveil the importance of user grouping and reflective\nbeamforming optimization for exploiting the joint encoding gain and enhancing\nthe worst-case user performance.",

    "abstract": "Synonymous keyword retrieval has become an important problem for sponsored\nsearch ever since major search engines relax the exact match product's matching\nrequirement to a synonymous level. Since the synonymous relations between\nqueries and keywords are quite scarce, the traditional information retrieval\nframework is inefficient in this scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel\nquotient space-based retrieval framework to address this problem. Considering\nthe synonymy among keywords as a mathematical equivalence relation, we can\ncompress the synonymous keywords into one representative, and the corresponding\nquotient space would greatly reduce the size of the keyword repository. Then an\nembedding-based retrieval is directly conducted between queries and the keyword\nrepresentatives. To mitigate the semantic gap of the quotient space-based\nretrieval, a single semantic siamese model is utilized to detect both the\nkeyword--keyword and query-keyword synonymous relations. The experiments show\nthat with our quotient space-based retrieval method, the synonymous keyword\nretrieving performance can be greatly improved in terms of memory cost and\nrecall efficiency.

    "abstract": "Defect prediction models can be beneficial to prioritize testing, analysis,\nor code review activities, and has been the subject of a substantial effort in\nacademia, and some applications in industrial contexts. A necessary\nprecondition when creating a defect prediction model is the availability of\ndefect data from the history of projects. If this data is noisy, the resulting\ndefect prediction model could result to be unreliable. One of the causes of\nnoise for defect datasets is the presence of \"dormant defects\", i.e., of\ndefects discovered several releases after their introduction. This can cause a\nclass to be labeled as defect-free while it is not, and is, therefore\n\"snoring\". In this paper, we investigate the impact of snoring on classifiers'\naccuracy and the effectiveness of a possible countermeasure, i.e., dropping too\nrecent data from a training set. We analyze the accuracy of 15 machine learning\ndefect prediction classifiers, on data from more than 4,000 defects and 600\nreleases of 19 open source projects from the Apache ecosystem. Our results show\nthat on average across projects: (i) the presence of dormant defects decreases\nthe recall of defect prediction classifiers, and (ii) removing from the\ntraining set the classes that in the last release are labeled as not defective\nsignificantly improves the accuracy of the classifiers. In summary, this paper\nprovides insights on how to create defects datasets by mitigating the negative\neffect of dormant defects on defect prediction.",

    "abstract": "Continual learning is essential for all real-world applications, as frozen\npre-trained models cannot effectively deal with non-stationary data\ndistributions. The purpose of this study is to review the state-of-the-art\nmethods that allow continuous learning of computational models over time. We\nprimarily focus on the learning algorithms that perform continuous learning in\nan online fashion from considerably large (or infinite) sequential data and\nrequire substantially low computational and memory resources. We critically\nanalyze the key challenges associated with continual learning for autonomous\nreal-world systems and compare current methods in terms of computations,\nmemory, and network/model complexity. We also briefly describe the\nimplementations of continuous learning algorithms under three main autonomous\nsystems, i.e., self-driving vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and robotics.\nThe learning methods of these autonomous systems and their strengths and\nlimitations are extensively explored in this article.",

In Alghorithm 1 we propose a fully discrete monolithic\nalgorithm with P1 P1 stabilized finite elements for the fluid problem; for this\nalghorithm we prove well-posedness, unconditional stability and convergence in\nthe case of linearized problem (see Propositions 2.4.2, 2.4.3 and Theorem\n3.3.7, respectively). The analysis optimal convergence rates as expected from\nthe Euler scheme, and the supposed regularity of the solution to the continuous\nproblem. Moreover we introduce two algorithms that allow for a partitioning of\nthe coupled problem by exploiting an explicit-implicit treatment of the\ntransmission conditions. Algorithm 2 represents, essentially, a simplification\nof Algorithm 1 since it simply treat the solid elastic forces in explicit form\nusing the displacement and velocities of the structure evaluated in the\nprevious time steps. Instead, Algorithm 3, is really a splitting algorithm that\ninvolves the solution of two staggered problems. It splits the forces that\nsolid transfers to fluid in two contributions: the inertial contribution that\nis treated in implicit form and the elastic contribution that is treated in\nexplicit form. We perform the stability analysis for both the schemes in\nTheorems 4.3.1 and 4.3.3. Algorithm 2 results conditionally stable for all the\nextrapolations considered, instead Algorithm 3 is unconditionally stable, for\nextrapolations of order zero and one, and conditionally stable for the\nextrapolation of order two. Since Algorithm 3 is the most promising, we perform\nthe convergence analysis in the linearized case (see Theorem 4.4.2) obtaining\nresults in line with those of the monolithic case, in particular the splitting\nintroduced preserves optimal conevegence rates.",

In\nthis paper we consider the problem of classifying which areas of a given\nsurface are fortified by for instance, roads, sidewalks, parking spaces, paved\ndriveways and terraces. We consider using LiDAR data and orthophotos, combined\nand alone, to show how well the modern machine learning algorithms Gradient\nBoosted Trees and Convolutional Neural Networks are able to detect fortified\nareas on large real world data. The LiDAR data features, in particular the\nintensity feature that measures the signal strength of the return, that we\nconsider in this project are heavily dependent on the actual LiDAR sensor that\nmade the measurement. This is highly problematic, in particular for the\ngeneralisation capability of pattern matching algorithms, as this means that\ndata features for test data may be very different from the data the model is\ntrained on. We propose an algorithmic solution to this problem by designing a\nneural net embedding architecture that transforms data from all the different\nsensor systems into a new common representation that works as well as if the\ntraining data and test data originated from the same sensor.

We\nshow that tuning the Receptive Field (RF) of CNNs is crucial to their\ngeneralization. An insufficient RF limits the CNN's ability to fit the training\ndata. In contrast, CNNs with an excessive RF tend to over-fit the training data\nand fail to generalize to unseen testing data. As state-of-the-art CNN\narchitectures-in computer vision and other domains-tend to go deeper in terms\nof number of layers, their RF size increases and therefore they degrade in\nperformance in several audio classification and tagging tasks. We study\nwell-known CNN architectures and how their building blocks affect their\nreceptive field. We propose several systematic approaches to control the RF of\nCNNs and systematically test the resulting architectures on different audio\nclassification and tagging tasks and datasets. The experiments show that\nregularizing the RF of CNNs using our proposed approaches can drastically\nimprove the generalization of models, out-performing complex architectures and\npre-trained models on larger datasets.

To tackle this parallel data bottleneck, we propose a sign\nback-translation (SignBT) approach, which incorporates massive spoken language\ntexts into SLT training.

The topic revolves around people's daily lives (e.g.,\ntravel, shopping, medical care), the most likely SLT application scenario.\nExtensive experimental results and analysis of SLT methods are reported on\nCSL-Daily.

After being injected with a backdoor in training, the victim\nmodel will produce adversary-specified outputs on the inputs embedded with\npredesigned triggers but behave properly on normal inputs during inference. As\na sort of emergent attack, backdoor attacks in natural language processing\n(NLP) are investigated insufficiently. As far as we know, almost all existing\ntextual backdoor attack methods insert additional contents into normal samples\nas triggers, which causes the trigger-embedded samples to be detected and the\nbackdoor attacks to be blocked without much effort.

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in computational biology is the construction of\nphylogenetic trees, also called evolutionary trees, for a set of organisms. A\ngraph-theoretic approach takes as input a similarity graph $G$ on the set of\norganisms, with adjacency denoting evolutionary closeness, and asks for a tree\n$T$ whose leaves are the set of organisms, with two vertices adjacent in $G$ if\nand only if the distance between them in the tree is less than some specified\ndistance bound. If this exists $G$ is called a leaf power. Over 20 years ago,\n[Nishimura et al., J. Algorithms, 2002] posed the question if leaf powers could\nbe recognized in polynomial time. In this paper we explore this still\nunanswered question from the perspective of two alternative models of leaf\npowers that have been rather overlooked. These models do not rely on a variable\ndistance bound and are therefore more apt for generalization.\nOur first result concerns leaf powers with a linear structure and uses a\nmodel where the edges of the tree $T$ are weighted by rationals between 0 and\n1, and the distance bound is fixed to 1. We show that the graphs having such a\nmodel with $T$ a caterpillar are exactly the co-threshold tolerance graphs and\ncan therefore be recognized in $O(n^2)$ time by an algorithm of [Golovach et\nal., Discret. Appl. Math., 2017].\nOur second result concerns leaf powers with a star structure and concerns the\ngeometric NeS model used by [Brandst\\\"adt et al., Discret. Math., 2010]. We\nshow that the graphs having a NeS model where the main embedding tree is a star\ncan be recognized in polynomial time.

    "abstract": "With the success of the graph embedding model in both academic and industry\nareas, the robustness of graph embedding against adversarial attack inevitably\nbecomes a crucial problem in graph learning. Existing works usually perform the\nattack in a white-box fashion: they need to access the predictions/labels to\nconstruct their adversarial loss. However, the inaccessibility of\npredictions/labels makes the white-box attack impractical to a real graph\nlearning system. This paper promotes current frameworks in a more general and\nflexible sense -- we demand to attack various kinds of graph embedding models\nwith black-box driven. We investigate the theoretical connections between graph\nsignal processing and graph embedding models and formulate the graph embedding\nmodel as a general graph signal process with a corresponding graph filter.\nTherefore, we design a generalized adversarial attacker: GF-Attack. Without\naccessing any labels and model predictions, GF-Attack can perform the attack\ndirectly on the graph filter in a black-box fashion. We further prove that\nGF-Attack can perform an effective attack without knowing the number of layers\nof graph embedding models. To validate the generalization of GF-Attack, we\nconstruct the attacker on four popular graph embedding models.

Experimental results shows\nthat models trained with these prototypes -- which we call deep repulsive\nprototypes -- gain robustness competitive with adversarial training, while also\npreserving more accuracy on natural samples. Moreover, the models are more\nresilient to large perturbation sizes. For example, we obtained over 50%\nrobustness for CIFAR-10, with 92% accuracy on natural samples and over 20%\nrobustness for CIFAR-100, with 71% accuracy on natural samples without\nadversarial training. For both data sets, the models preserved robustness\nagainst large perturbations better than adversarially trained models.",

To sustain the\neducation development teaching methods had to switch from traditional\nface-to-face teaching to online courses. The government made decisions in a\nshort time and educational institutions had no time to prepare the materials\nfor the online teaching. All courses of the Mongolian University of\nPharmaceutical Sciences switched to online lessons. Challenges were raised\nbefore professors and tutors during online teaching. Our university did not\nhave a specific learning management system for online teaching and e-learning.\nTherefore professors used different platforms for their online teaching such as\nZoom, Microsoft teams for instance. Moreover, different social networking\nplatforms played an active role in communication between students and\nprofessors. The situation is very difficult for professors and students. To\nmeasure the quality of online courses and to figure out the positive and weak\npoints of online teaching we need an evaluation of e-learning.

This paper studies a dynamic game\nmodel that describes the social distancing behaviors during an epidemic,\nassuming a continuum of players and individual infection dynamics. The\nevolution of the players' infection states follows a variant of the well-known\nSIR dynamics. We assume that the players are not sure about their infection\nstate, and thus they choose their actions based on their individually perceived\nprobabilities of being susceptible, infected or removed. The cost of each\nplayer depends both on her infection state and on the contact with others. We\nprove the existence of a Nash equilibrium and characterize Nash equilibria\nusing nonlinear complementarity problems. We then exploit some monotonicity\nproperties of the optimal policies to obtain a reduced-order characterization\nfor Nash equilibrium and reduce its computation to the solution of a\nlow-dimensional optimization problem. It turns out that, even in the symmetric\ncase, where all the players have the same parameters, players may have very\ndifferent behaviors. We finally present some numerical studies that illustrate\nthis interesting phenomenon and investigate the effects of several parameters,\nincluding the players' vulnerability, the time horizon, and the maximum allowed\nactions, on the optimal policies and the players' costs.",

Research has found that web search activity can be used\nto improve influenza models. Neural networks (NN) can provide state-of-the-art\nforecasting accuracy but do not commonly incorporate uncertainty in their\nestimates, something essential for using them effectively during decision\nmaking. In this paper, we demonstrate how Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) can\nbe used to both provide a forecast and a corresponding uncertainty without\nsignificant loss in forecasting accuracy compared to traditional NNs. Our\nmethod accounts for two sources of uncertainty: data and model uncertainty,\narising due to measurement noise and model specification, respectively.\nExperiments are conducted using 14 years of data for England, assessing the\nmodel's accuracy over the last 4 flu seasons in this dataset. We evaluate the\nperformance of different models including competitive baselines with\nconventional metrics as well as error functions that incorporate uncertainty\nestimates. Our empirical analysis indicates that considering both sources of\nuncertainty simultaneously is superior to considering either one separately. We\nalso show that a BNN with recurrent layers that models both sources of\nuncertainty yields superior accuracy for these metrics for forecasting horizons\ngreater than 7 days.",

This paper qualifies the notion that automatic metrics are not as good as\nhumans in estimating system-level quality. Statistically, humans are unbiased,\nhigh variance estimators, while metrics are biased, low variance estimators. We\ncompare these estimators by their error in pairwise prediction (which\ngeneration system is better?) using the bootstrap. Measuring this error is\ncomplicated: predictions are evaluated against noisy, human predicted labels\ninstead of the ground truth, and metric predictions fluctuate based on the test\nsets they were calculated on. By applying a bias-variance-noise decomposition,\nwe adjust this error to a noise-free, infinite test set setting. Our analysis\ncompares the adjusted error of metrics to humans and a derived, perfect\nsegment-level annotator, both of which are unbiased estimators dependent on the\nnumber of judgments collected. In MT, we identify two settings where metrics\noutperform humans due to a statistical advantage in variance: when the number\nof human judgments used is small, and when the quality difference between\ncompared systems is small.

    "abstract": "Source code can be parsed into the abstract syntax tree (AST) based on\ndefined syntax rules. However, in pre-training, little work has considered the\nincorporation of tree structure into the learning process. In this paper, we\npresent TreeBERT, a tree-based pre-trained model for improving programming\nlanguage-oriented generation tasks. To utilize tree structure, TreeBERT\nrepresents the AST corresponding to the code as a set of composition paths and\nintroduces node position embedding. The model is trained by tree masked\nlanguage modeling (TMLM) and node order prediction (NOP) with a hybrid\nobjective. TMLM uses a novel masking strategy designed according to the tree's\ncharacteristics to help the model understand the AST and infer the missing\nsemantics of the AST. With NOP, TreeBERT extracts the syntactical structure by\nlearning the order constraints of nodes in AST. We pre-trained TreeBERT on\ndatasets covering multiple programming languages. On code summarization and\ncode documentation tasks, TreeBERT outperforms other pre-trained models and\nstate-of-the-art models designed for these tasks. Furthermore, TreeBERT\nperforms well when transferred to the pre-trained unseen programming language.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning play a vital role in classifying different arrhythmias using\nthe electrocardiography (ECG) data. Nevertheless, training deep learning models\nnormally requires a large amount of data and it can lead to privacy concerns.\nUnfortunately, a large amount of healthcare data cannot be easily collected\nfrom a single silo. Additionally, deep learning models are like black-box, with\nno explainability of the predicted results, which is often required in clinical\nhealthcare. This limits the application of deep learning in real-world health\nsystems. In this paper, we design a new explainable artificial intelligence\n(XAI) based deep learning framework in a federated setting for ECG-based\nhealthcare applications. The federated setting is used to solve issues such as\ndata availability and privacy concerns. Furthermore, the proposed framework\nsetting effectively classifies arrhythmia's using an autoencoder and a\nclassifier, both based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally,\nwe propose an XAI-based module on top of the proposed classifier to explain the\nclassification results, which help clinical practitioners make quick and\nreliable decisions. The proposed framework was trained and tested using the\nMIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The classifier achieved accuracy up to 94% and 98%\nfor arrhythmia detection using noisy and clean data, respectively, with\nfive-fold cross-validation.",

    "abstract": "Transportation services play a crucial part in the development of modern\nsmart cities. In particular, on-demand ridesharing services, which group\ntogether passengers with similar itineraries, are already operating in several\nmetropolitan areas. These services can be of significant social and\nenvironmental benefit, by reducing travel costs, road congestion and CO2\nemissions.\nUnfortunately, despite their advantages, not many people opt to use these\nridesharing services. We believe that increasing the user satisfaction from the\nservice will cause more people to utilize it, which, in turn, will improve the\nquality of the service, such as the waiting time, cost, travel time, and\nservice availability. One possible way for increasing user satisfaction is by\nproviding appropriate explanations comparing the alternative modes of\ntransportation, such as a private taxi ride and public transportation. For\nexample, a passenger may be more satisfied from a shared-ride if she is told\nthat a private taxi ride would have cost her 50% more. Therefore, the problem\nis to develop an agent that provides explanations that will increase the user\nsatisfaction.\nWe model our environment as a signaling game and show that a rational agent,\nwhich follows the perfect Bayesian equilibrium, must reveal all of the\ninformation regarding the possible alternatives to the passenger. In addition,\nwe develop a machine learning based agent that, when given a shared-ride along\nwith its possible alternatives, selects the explanations that are most likely\nto increase user satisfaction. Using feedback from humans we show that our\nmachine learning based agent outperforms the rational agent and an agent that\nrandomly chooses explanations, in terms of user satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "Automatic detection systems are important in passive acoustic monitoring\n(PAM) systems, as these record large amounts of audio data which are infeasible\nfor humans to evaluate manually. In this paper we evaluated methods for\ncompensating class imbalance for deep-learning based automatic detection of\nacoustic chimpanzee calls. The prevalence of chimpanzee calls in natural\nhabitats is very rare, i.e. databases feature a heavy imbalance between\nbackground and target calls. Such imbalances can have negative effects on\nclassifier performances. We employed a state-of-the-art detection approach\nbased on convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs). We extended the\ndetection pipeline through various stages for compensating class imbalance.\nThese included (1) spectrogram denoising, (2) alternative loss functions, and\n(3) resampling. Our key findings are: (1) spectrogram denoising operations\nsignificantly improved performance for both target classes, (2) standard binary\ncross entropy reached the highest performance, and (3) manipulating relative\nclass imbalance through resampling either decreased or maintained performance\ndepending on the target class. Finally, we reached detection performances of\n33% for drumming and 5% for vocalization, which is a >7 fold increase compared\nto previously published results.

Our focus is on automatic deception\ndetection in text across cultures. We view culture through the prism of the\nindividualism/collectivism dimension and we approximate culture by using\ncountry as a proxy. Having as a starting point recent conclusions drawn from\nthe social psychology discipline, we explore if differences in the usage of\nspecific linguistic features of deception across cultures can be confirmed and\nattributed to norms in respect to the individualism/collectivism divide. We\nalso investigate if a universal feature set for cross-cultural text deception\ndetection tasks exists. We evaluate the predictive power of different feature\nsets and approaches. We create culture/language-aware classifiers by\nexperimenting with a wide range of n-gram features based on phonology,\nmorphology and syntax, other linguistic cues like word and phoneme counts,\npronouns use, etc., and token embeddings. We conducted our experiments over 11\ndatasets from 5 languages i.e., English, Dutch, Russian, Spanish and Romanian,\nfrom six countries (US, Belgium, India, Russia, Mexico and Romania), and we\napplied two classification methods i.e, logistic regression and fine-tuned BERT\nmodels. The results showed that our task is fairly complex and demanding. There\nare indications that some linguistic cues of deception have cultural origins,\nand are consistent in the context of diverse domains and dataset settings for\nthe same language. This is more evident for the usage of pronouns and the\nexpression of sentiment in deceptive language. The results of this work show\nthat the automatic deception detection across cultures and languages cannot be\nhandled in a unified manner, and that such approaches should be augmented with\nknowledge about cultural differences and the domains of interest.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide refugee crisis is a major current challenge, affecting the\nhealth and education of millions of families with children due to displacement.\nDespite the various challenges and risks of migration practices, numerous\nrefugee families have access to interactive technologies during these\nprocesses. The aim of this ongoing study is to explore the role of technologies\nin the transitions of refugee families in Scotland. Based on Tudge's\necocultural theory, a qualitative case-study approach has been adopted.\nSemi-structured interviews have been conducted with volunteers who work with\nrefugee families in a big city in Scotland, and proxy observations of young\nchildren were facilitated remotely by their refugee parents. A preliminary\noverview of the participants' insights of the use and role of technology for\ntransitioning into a new culture is provided here.",

In order to overcome the\ndivergence due to deadly triad in off-policy policy evaluation under function\napproximation, we develop a critic that employs $n$-step TD-learning algorithm\nwith a properly chosen $n$. We present finite-sample convergence bounds on this\ncritic under both constant and diminishing step sizes, which are of independent\ninterest. Furthermore, we develop a variant of natural policy gradient under\nfunction approximation, with an improved convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$\nafter $T$ iterations. Combining the finite sample error bounds of actor and the\ncritic, we obtain the $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3})$ sample complexity. We derive\nour sample complexity bounds solely based on the assumption that the behavior\npolicy sufficiently explores all the states and actions, which is a much\nlighter assumption compared to the related literature.",

The SCAOPO is based on solving a sequence of\nconvex objective/feasibility optimization problems obtained by replacing the\nobjective and constraint functions in the original problems with convex\nsurrogate functions. At each iteration, the convex surrogate problem can be\nefficiently solved by Lagrange dual method even the policy is parameterized by\na high-dimensional function.

Aligned to this goal,\nthis work puts forth a novel framework for learning dynamics after small-signal\ndisturbances by leveraging Gaussian processes (GPs). We extend results on\nlearning of a linear time-invariant system using GPs to the multi-input\nmulti-output setup. This is accomplished by decomposing power system swing\ndynamics into a set of single-input single-output linear systems with narrow\nfrequency pass bands. The proposed learning technique captures time derivatives\nin continuous time, accommodates data streams sampled at different rates, and\ncan cope with missing data and heterogeneous levels of accuracy. While Kalman\nfilter-based approaches require knowing all system inputs, the proposed\nframework handles readings of system inputs, outputs, their derivatives, and\ncombinations thereof collected from an arbitrary subset of buses. Relying on\nminimal system information, it further provides uncertainty quantification in\naddition to point estimates of system dynamics. Numerical tests verify that\nthis technique can infer dynamics at non-metered buses, impute and predict\nsynchrophasors, and locate faults under linear and non-linear system models\nunder ambient and fault disturbances.",

    "abstract": "In this work we present definitive evidence, analysis, and (where needed)\nspeculation to answer the questions, (1) Which concrete security measures in\nmobile devices meaningfully prevent unauthorized access to user data? (2) In\nwhat ways are modern mobile devices accessed by unauthorized parties? (3) How\ncan we improve modern mobile devices to prevent unauthorized access?\nWe examine the two major platforms in the mobile space, iOS and Android, and\nfor each we provide a thorough investigation of existing and historical\nsecurity features, evidence-based discussion of known security bypass\ntechniques, and concrete recommendations for remediation. We then aggregate and\nanalyze public records, documentation, articles, and blog postings to\ncategorize and discuss unauthorized bypass of security features by hackers and\nlaw enforcement alike. We provide in-depth analysis of the data potentially\naccessed via law enforcement methodologies from both mobile devices and\nassociated cloud services.\nOur fact-gathering and analysis allow us to make a number of recommendations\nfor improving data security on these devices. The mitigations we propose can be\nlargely summarized as increasing coverage of sensitive data via strong\nencryption, but we detail various challenges and approaches towards this goal\nand others. It is our hope that this work stimulates mobile device development\nand research towards security and privacy, provides a unique reference of\ninformation, and acts as an evidence-based argument for the importance of\nreliable encryption to privacy, which we believe is both a human right and\nintegral to a functioning democracy.",

The algorithm follows from\nthe intuition that when using a classifier trained on one environment to make\npredictions on examples from another environment, its mistakes are informative\nas to which correlations are unstable. In this work, we prove that by\ninterpolating the distributions of the correct predictions and the wrong\npredictions, we can uncover an oracle distribution where the unstable\ncorrelation vanishes. Since the oracle interpolation coefficients are not\naccessible, we use group distributionally robust optimization to minimize the\nworst-case risk across all such interpolations. We evaluate our method on both\ntext classification and image classification. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat our algorithm is able to learn robust classifiers (outperforms IRM by\n23.85% on synthetic environments and 12.41% on natural environments).

However, a crucial challenge prohibits\ntheir use in practice: Bayesian NNs require a large number of predictions to\nproduce reliable results, leading to a significant increase in computational\ncost. To alleviate this issue, we propose spatial smoothing, a method that\nensembles neighboring feature map points of CNNs. By simply adding a few blur\nlayers to the models, we empirically show that the spatial smoothing improves\naccuracy, uncertainty estimation, and robustness of BNNs across a whole range\nof ensemble sizes. In particular, BNNs incorporating the spatial smoothing\nachieve high predictive performance merely with a handful of ensembles.\nMoreover, this method also can be applied to canonical deterministic neural\nnetworks to improve the performances. A number of evidences suggest that the\nimprovements can be attributed to the smoothing and flattening of the loss\nlandscape. In addition, we provide a fundamental explanation for prior works -\nnamely, global average pooling, pre-activation, and ReLU6 - by addressing to\nthem as special cases of the spatial smoothing. These not only enhance\naccuracy, but also improve uncertainty estimation and robustness by making the\nloss landscape smoother in the same manner as the spatial smoothing.

By artificially imposing\ntopological structures on the UE-RRH connectivity, we model the network by a\npartially-connected interference network, so that the pilot assignment problem\ncan be cast as a topological interference management problem with multiple\ngroupcast messages. Building upon such connection, we formulate the topological\npilot assignment (TPA) problem in two different ways with respect to whether or\nnot the to-be-estimated channel connectivity pattern is known a priori. When it\nis known, we formulate the TPA problem as a low-rank matrix completion problem\nthat can be solved by a simple alternating projection algorithm. Otherwise, we\nformulate it as a sequential maximum weight induced matching problem that can\nbe solved by either a mixed integer linear program or a simple yet efficient\ngreedy algorithm.

By\nperforming these optimisations on the conceptual schema, a large part of the\ndatabase optimisation can be done before actually sliding down the software\ndevelopment waterfall. When optimising schemas, one would like to preserve some\nlevel of equivalence between the schemas before and after a transformation. We\ndistinguish between two classes of equivalence, one based on the mathematical\nsemantics of the conceptual schemas, and one on conceptual preference by\nhumans. As a medium for the schema transformations we use the universe of all\n(correct) conceptual schemas. A schema transformation process can then be seen\nas a journey (a schema-time worm) within this universe. The underlying theory\nis conveyed intuitively with sample transformations, and formalised within the\nframework of Object-Role Modelling. A metalanguage is introduced for the\nspecification of transformations, and more importantly their semantics. While\nthe discussion focusses on the data perspective, the approach has a high level\nof generality and is extensible to process and behaviour perspectives.",

Traditionally, the success of conceptual\nmodelling techniques has depended largely on the adequacy of conceptualisation,\nexpressive power, comprehensibility and formal foundation. An equally important\nrequirement, particularly with the increased conceptualisation of business\naspects, is \\EM{business suitability}. In this paper, the focus is on the\nbusiness suitability of workflow modelling for a commonly encountered class of\n(operational) business processing, e.g. those of insurance claims, bank loans\nand land conveyancing. A general assessment is first conducted on some\n\\EM{integrated} techniques characterising well-known paradigms - structured\nprocess modelling, object-oriented modelling, behavioural process modelling and\nbusiness-oriented modelling. Through this, an insight into business suitability\nwithin the broader perspective of technique adequacy, is gained. A specific\nbusiness suitability diagnosis then follows using a particular characterisation\nof business processing, i.e.\\ one where the intuitive semantics and\ninter-relationship of business services and business processes are nuanced. As\na result, five business suitability principles are elicited. These are proposed\nfor a more detailed understanding and (synthetic) development of workflow\nmodelling techniques.

By studying online communication along the three dimensions\nof social interactions (connectivity, interactivity and language use), the\nauthors aim to provide VCoP managers with valuable insights to improve the\nsuccess of their communities. Design/methodology/approach: Communications over\na period of seven years (April 2008 to April 2015) and between 14,000 members\nof 16 different healthcare VCoPs coexisting on the same web platform were\nanalysed. Multilevel regression models were used to reveal the main\ndeterminants of community growth over time. Independent variables were derived\nfrom social network and semantic analysis measures. Findings: Results show that\nstructural and content-based variables predict the growth of the community.\nProgressively, more people will join a community if its structure is more\ncentralised, leaders are more dynamic (they rotate more) and the language used\nin the posts is less complex. Research limitations/implications: The available\ndata set included one Web platform and a limited number of control variables.\nTo consolidate the findings of the present study, the experiment should be\nreplicated on other healthcare VCoPs. Originality/value: The study provides\nuseful recommendations for setting up and nurturing the growth of professional\ncommunities, considering, at the same time, the interaction patterns among the\ncommunity members, the dynamic evolution of these interactions and the use of\nlanguage. New analytical tools are presented, together with the use of\ninnovative interaction metrics, that can significantly influence community\ngrowth, such as rotating leadership.",

    "abstract": "Recent works have shown that a rich set of semantic directions exist in the\nlatent space of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which enables various\nfacial attribute editing applications. However, existing methods may suffer\npoor attribute variation disentanglement, leading to unwanted change of other\nattributes when altering the desired one. The semantic directions used by\nexisting methods are at attribute level, which are difficult to model complex\nattribute correlations, especially in the presence of attribute distribution\nbias in GAN's training set. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (IALS)\nthat performs Instance-Aware Latent-Space Search to find semantic directions\nfor disentangled attribute editing. The instance information is injected by\nleveraging the supervision from a set of attribute classifiers evaluated on the\ninput images. We further propose a Disentanglement-Transformation (DT) metric\nto quantify the attribute transformation and disentanglement efficacy and find\nthe optimal control factor between attribute-level and instance-specific\ndirections based on it.

The grand scale of\nbiodiversity contributes to the great locomotory design and mode diversity.\nVarious creatures make use of legs, wings, fins and other means to move through\nthe world. In this report, we refer to the locomotion of general biological\nspecies as biolocomotion. We present a computational approach to detect\nbiolocomotion in unprocessed video.\nSignificantly, the motion exhibited by the body parts of a biological entity\nto navigate through an environment can be modeled by a combination of an\noverall positional advance with an overlaid asymmetric oscillatory pattern, a\ndistinctive signature that tends to be absent in non-biological objects in\nlocomotion. We exploit this key trait of positional advance with asymmetric\noscillation along with differences in an object's common motion (extrinsic\nmotion) and localized motion of its parts (intrinsic motion) to detect\nbiolocomotion. An algorithm is developed to measure the presence of these\ntraits in tracked objects to determine if they correspond to a biological\nentity in locomotion. An alternative algorithm, based on generic features\ncombined with learning is assembled out of components from allied areas of\ninvestigation, also is presented as a basis of comparison.\nA novel biolocomotion dataset encompassing a wide range of moving biological\nand non-biological objects in natural settings is provided. Also, biolocomotion\nannotations to an extant camouflage animals dataset are provided. Quantitative\nresults indicate that the proposed algorithm considerably outperforms the\nalternative approach, supporting the hypothesis that biolocomotion can be\ndetected reliably based on its distinct signature of positional advance with\nasymmetric oscillation and extrinsic/intrinsic motion dissimilarity.",

    "title": "Prosodic segmentation for parsing spoken dialogue",
    "abstract": "Parsing spoken dialogue poses unique difficulties, including disfluencies and\nunmarked boundaries between sentence-like units. Previous work has shown that\nprosody can help with parsing disfluent speech (Tran et al. 2018), but has\nassumed that the input to the parser is already segmented into sentence-like\nunits (SUs), which isn't true in existing speech applications. We investigate\nhow prosody affects a parser that receives an entire dialogue turn as input (a\nturn-based model), instead of gold standard pre-segmented SUs (an SU-based\nmodel). In experiments on the English Switchboard corpus, we find that when\nusing transcripts alone, the turn-based model has trouble segmenting SUs,\nleading to worse parse performance than the SU-based model. However, prosody\ncan effectively replace gold standard SU boundaries: with prosody, the\nturn-based model performs as well as the SU-based model (90.79 vs. 90.65 F1\nscore, respectively), despite performing two tasks (SU segmentation and\nparsing) rather than one (parsing alone). Analysis shows that pitch and\nintensity features are the most important for this corpus, since they allow the\nmodel to correctly distinguish an SU boundary from a speech disfluency -- a\ndistinction that the model otherwise struggles to make.",

Design/methodology/approach: Through a web-survey\nand group interviews, the authors collected data on the communication networks\nof 31 members of four interdisciplinary healthcare teams involved in a system\nredesign initiative within a large US children's hospital. The authors mapped\ntheir internal and external social networks based on management advice,\ntechnical support and knowledge dissemination within and across departments,\nstudying interaction patterns that involved more than 700 actors. The authors\nthen compared team performance and social network metrics such as degree,\ncloseness and betweenness centrality, and computed cross ties and constraint\nlevels for each team. Findings: The results indicate that highly effective\nteams were more inwardly focused and less connected to outside members.\nMoreover, highly recognized teams communicated frequently but, overall, less\nintensely than the others.

    "abstract": "Tremendous success of machine learning (ML) and the unabated growth in ML\nmodel complexity motivated many ML-specific designs in both CPU and accelerator\narchitectures to speed up the model inference. While these architectures are\ndiverse, highly optimized low-precision arithmetic is a component shared by\nmost. Impressive compute throughputs are indeed often exhibited by these\narchitectures on benchmark ML models. Nevertheless, production models such as\nrecommendation systems important to Facebook's personalization services are\ndemanding and complex: These systems must serve billions of users per month\nresponsively with low latency while maintaining high prediction accuracy,\nnotwithstanding computations with many tens of billions parameters per\ninference. Do these low-precision architectures work well with our production\nrecommendation systems? They do. But not without significant effort. We share\nin this paper our search strategies to adapt reference recommendation models to\nlow-precision hardware, our optimization of low-precision compute kernels, and\nthe design and development of tool chain so as to maintain our models' accuracy\nthroughout their lifespan during which topic trends and users' interests\ninevitably evolve. Practicing these low-precision technologies helped us save\ndatacenter capacities while deploying models with up to 5X complexity that\nwould otherwise not be deployed on traditional general-purpose CPUs.

The goal is to evaluate layer\npotentials close to the boundary over which they are defined. The approach\nintroduced here converts these nearly-singular integrals on a patch of the\nboundary to a set of non-singular line integrals on the patch boundary using\nthe Stokes theorem on manifolds. A function approximation scheme based on\nharmonic polynomials is designed to express the integrand in a form that is\nsuitable for applying the Stokes theorem. As long as the data -- the boundary\nand the density function -- is given in a high-order format, the double-layer\npotential and its derivatives can be evaluated with high-order accuracy using\nthis scheme both on and off the boundary. In particular, we present numerical\nresults demonstrating seventh-order convergence on a smooth, warped torus\nexample achieving 10-digit accuracy in evaluating double layer potential at\ntargets that are arbitrarily close to the boundary.",

In unconstrained scenarios, person images often suffer\nfrom the resolution mismatch problem, i.e., \\emph{Cross-Resolution Person\nRe-ID}.

However, the resulting - typically irregular - sparse\nmatrices hamper efficient hardware implementations, leading to additional\nmemory usage and complex control logic that diminishes the benefits of\nunstructured pruning. This has spurred structured coarse-grained pruning\nsolutions that prune entire filters or even layers, enabling efficient\nimplementation at the expense of reduced flexibility. Here we propose a\nflexible new pruning mechanism that facilitates pruning at different\ngranularities (weights, kernels, filters/feature maps), while retaining\nefficient memory organization (e.g. pruning exactly k-out-of-n weights for\nevery output neuron, or pruning exactly k-out-of-n kernels for every feature\nmap). We refer to this algorithm as Dynamic Probabilistic Pruning (DPP). DPP\nleverages the Gumbel-softmax relaxation for differentiable k-out-of-n sampling,\nfacilitating end-to-end optimization. We show that DPP achieves competitive\ncompression rates and classification accuracy when pruning common deep learning\nmodels trained on different benchmark datasets for image classification.\nRelevantly, the non-magnitude-based nature of DPP allows for joint optimization\nof pruning and weight quantization in order to even further compress the\nnetwork, which we show as well.

In this setting, distance metric learning algorithms move closer\npairs of data points involved in must-link constraints, while pairs of points\ninvolved in cannot-link constraints are moved away from each other. For these\nalgorithms to be effective, it is important to use a distance metric that\nmatches the expert knowledge, beliefs, and expectations, and the\ntransformations made to stick to the side-information should preserve\ngeometrical properties of the dataset.

Using a novel connection between contention\nresolution and information theory, we prove lower bounds on the expected time\ncomplexity with respect to the Shannon entropy of the corresponding network\nsize random variable, for both the collision detection and no collision\ndetection assumptions.

We express their performance with\nrespect to both entropy and the statistical divergence between the two\ndistributions -- allowing us to quantify the cost of poor predictions. Finally,\nwe turn our attention to the related perfect advice setting, parameterized with\na length $b\\geq 0$, in which all active processes in a given execution are\nprovided the best possible $b$ bits of information about their network.

Fusion of these two encoded features takes\nplace inside a multimodal feature embedding module (MuFEm) consisting of\nseveral groups of a pair of Graph Attention Network and a feature fusion unit.\nThe output of the last feature fusion unit of MuFEm is subsequently passed to\ntwo CRFs for their spatial refinement. Further enhancement of the features is\nachieved by applying channel-wise attention and extraction of contextual\ninformation with the help of four RNNs traversing in four different directions.\nFinally, these feature maps are used by a single-stage decoder to generate the\nbounding box of each pedestrian and the score map. We have performed extensive\nexperiments of the proposed framework on three publicly available multimodal\npedestrian detection benchmark datasets, namely KAIST, CVC-14, and UTokyo. The\nresults on each of them improved the respective state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Although hierarchical structures are popular in recent vision transformers,\nthey require sophisticated designs and massive datasets to work well. In this\nwork, we explore the idea of nesting basic local transformers on\nnon-overlapping image blocks and aggregating them in a hierarchical manner. We\nfind that the block aggregation function plays a critical role in enabling\ncross-block non-local information communication. This observation leads us to\ndesign a simplified architecture with minor code changes upon the original\nvision transformer and obtains improved performance compared to existing\nmethods. Our empirical results show that the proposed method NesT converges\nfaster and requires much less training data to achieve good generalization. For\nexample, a NesT with 68M parameters trained on ImageNet for 100/300 epochs\nachieves $82.3\\%/83.8\\%$ accuracy evaluated on $224\\times 224$ image size,\noutperforming previous methods with up to $57\\%$ parameter reduction. Training\na NesT with 6M parameters from scratch on CIFAR10 achieves $96\\%$ accuracy\nusing a single GPU, setting a new state of the art for vision transformers.\nBeyond image classification, we extend the key idea to image generation and\nshow NesT leads to a strong decoder that is 8$\\times$ faster than previous\ntransformer based generators.

    "abstract": "Ability to generate intelligent and generalizable facial expressions is\nessential for building human-like social robots. At present, progress in this\nfield is hindered by the fact that each facial expression needs to be\nprogrammed by humans. In order to adapt robot behavior in real time to\ndifferent situations that arise when interacting with human subjects, robots\nneed to be able to train themselves without requiring human labels, as well as\nmake fast action decisions and generalize the acquired knowledge to diverse and\nnew contexts. We addressed this challenge by designing a physical animatronic\nrobotic face with soft skin and by developing a vision-based self-supervised\nlearning framework for facial mimicry. Our algorithm does not require any\nknowledge of the robot's kinematic model, camera calibration or predefined\nexpression set. By decomposing the learning process into a generative model and\nan inverse model, our framework can be trained using a single motor babbling\ndataset. Comprehensive evaluations show that our method enables accurate and\ndiverse face mimicry across diverse human subjects. The project website is at\nthis http URL",

During training, such systems require clean\nspeech data - ideally, in large quantity with a variety of acoustic conditions,\nmany different speaker characteristics and for a given sampling rate (e.g.,\n48kHz for fullband SE). However, obtaining such clean speech data is not\nstraightforward - especially, if only considering publicly available datasets.\nAt the same time, a lot of material for automatic speech recognition (ASR) with\nthe desired acoustic/speaker/sampling rate characteristics is publicly\navailable except being clean, i.e., it also contains background noise as this\nis even often desired in order to have ASR systems that are noise-robust.\nHence, using such data to train SE systems is not straightforward. In this\npaper, we propose two improvements to train SE systems on noisy speech data.\nFirst, we propose several modifications of the loss functions, which make them\nrobust against noisy speech targets. In particular, computing the median over\nthe sample axis before averaging over time-frequency bins allows to use such\ndata. Furthermore, we propose a noise augmentation scheme for mixture-invariant\ntraining (MixIT), which allows using it also in such scenarios. For our\nexperiments, we use the Mozilla Common Voice dataset and we show that using our\nrobust loss function improves PESQ by up to 0.19 compared to a system trained\nin the traditional way. Similarly, for MixIT we can see an improvement of up to\n0.27 in PESQ when using our proposed noise augmentation.",

Specifically, to decode the\nimages with one single decoder under various computational complexity\nconstraints, we propose a new multi-branch complexity adaptive module, in which\neach branch only takes a small portion of the computational budget of the\ndecoder. The reconstructed images with different visual qualities can be\nreadily generated by using different numbers of branches. Furthermore, to\nachieve variable bitrate decoding with one single decoder, we propose a bitrate\nadaptive module to project the representation from a base bitrate to the\nexpected representation at a target bitrate for transmission. Then it will\nproject the transmitted representation at the target bitrate back to that at\nthe base bitrate for the decoding process. The proposed bit adaptive module can\nsignificantly reduce the storage requirement for deployment platforms. As a\nresult, our CBANet enables one single codec to support multiple bitrate\ndecoding under various computational complexity constraints. Comprehensive\nexperiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nCBANet for deep image compression.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have shown how deep neural networks can be extremely\neffective at super-resolving remote sensing imagery, starting from a\nmultitemporal collection of low-resolution images. However, existing models\nhave neglected the issue of temporal permutation, whereby the temporal ordering\nof the input images does not carry any relevant information for the\nsuper-resolution task and causes such models to be inefficient with the, often\nscarce, ground truth data that available for training. Thus, models ought not\nto learn feature extractors that rely on temporal ordering. In this paper, we\nshow how building a model that is fully invariant to temporal permutation\nsignificantly improves performance and data efficiency. Moreover, we study how\nto quantify the uncertainty of the super-resolved image so that the final user\nis informed on the local quality of the product. We show how uncertainty\ncorrelates with temporal variation in the series, and how quantifying it\nfurther improves model performance. Experiments on the Proba-V challenge\ndataset show significant improvements over the state of the art without the\nneed for self-ensembling, as well as improved data efficiency, reaching the\nperformance of the challenge winner with just 25% of the training data.",

    "abstract": "Chest X-rays are the most commonly available and affordable radiological\nexamination for screening thoracic diseases. According to the domain knowledge\nof screening chest X-rays, the pathological information usually lay on the lung\nand heart regions. However, it is costly to acquire region-level annotation in\npractice, and model training mainly relies on image-level class labels in a\nweakly supervised manner, which is highly challenging for computer-aided chest\nX-ray screening. To address this issue, some methods have been proposed\nrecently to identify local regions containing pathological information, which\nis vital for thoracic disease classification. Inspired by this, we propose a\nnovel deep learning framework to explore discriminative information from lung\nand heart regions. We design a feature extractor equipped with a multi-scale\nattention module to learn global attention maps from global images. To exploit\ndisease-specific cues effectively, we locate lung and heart regions containing\npathological information by a well-trained pixel-wise segmentation model to\ngenerate binarization masks. By introducing element-wise logical AND operator\non the learned global attention maps and the binarization masks, we obtain\nlocal attention maps in which pixels are $1$ for lung and heart region and $0$\nfor other regions. By zeroing features of non-lung and heart regions in\nattention maps, we can effectively exploit their disease-specific cues in lung\nand heart regions. Compared to existing methods fusing global and local\nfeatures, we adopt feature weighting to avoid weakening visual cues unique to\nlung and heart regions. Evaluated by the benchmark split on the publicly\navailable chest X-ray14 dataset, the comprehensive experiments show that our\nmethod achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of cross-modal musical piece identification\nand retrieval: finding the appropriate recording(s) from a database given a\nsheet music query, and vice versa, working directly with audio and scanned\nsheet music images. The fundamental approach to this is to learn a cross-modal\nembedding space with a suitable similarity structure for audio and sheet image\nsnippets, using a deep neural network, and identifying candidate pieces by\ncross-modal near neighbour search in this space. However, this method is\noblivious of temporal aspects of music. In this paper, we introduce two\nstrategies that address this shortcoming. First, we present a strategy that\naligns sequences of embeddings learned from sheet music scans and audio\nsnippets. A series of experiments on whole piece and fragment-level retrieval\non 24 hours worth of classical piano recordings demonstrates significant\nimprovement. Second, we show that the retrieval can be further improved by\nintroducing an attention mechanism to the embedding learning model that reduces\nthe effects of tempo variations in music.

    "abstract": "Long-range correlated errors can severely impact the performance of NISQ\n(noisy intermediate-scale quantum) devices, and fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation. Characterizing these errors is important for improving the\nperformance of these devices, via calibration and error correction, and to\nensure correct interpretation of the results. We propose a compressed sensing\nmethod for detecting two-qubit correlated dephasing errors, assuming only that\nthe correlations are sparse (i.e., at most s pairs of qubits have correlated\nerrors, where s << n(n-1)/2, and n is the total number of qubits). In\nparticular, our method can detect long-range correlations between any two\nqubits in the system (i.e., the correlations are not restricted to be\ngeometrically local).\nOur method is highly scalable: it requires as few as m = O(s log n)\nmeasurement settings, and efficient classical postprocessing based on convex\noptimization. In addition, when m = O(s log^4(n)), our method is highly robust\nto noise, and has sample complexity O(max(n,s)^2 log^4(n)), which can be\ncompared to conventional methods that have sample complexity O(n^3). Thus, our\nmethod is advantageous when the correlations are sufficiently sparse, that is,\nwhen s < O(n^(3/2) / log^2(n)). Our method also performs well in numerical\nsimulations on small system sizes, and has some resistance to\nstate-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) errors. The key ingredient in our\nmethod is a new type of compressed sensing measurement, which works by\npreparing entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states (GHZ states) on random\nsubsets of qubits, and measuring their decay rates with high precision.",

The local cost function of each\nnode is affected by some stochastic process. All nodes of the network\ncollaborate to minimize the average of their local cost functions. The major\nchallenge of our work is that the gradient of cost functions is supposed to be\nunavailable and has to be estimated only based on the numerical observation of\ncost functions. Such problem is known as zeroth-order stochastic convex\noptimization (ZOSCO). In this paper we take a first step towards the\ndistributed optimization problem with a ZOSCO setting. The proposed algorithm\ncontains two basic steps at each iteration: i) each unit updates a local\nvariable according to a random perturbation based single point gradient\nestimator of its own local cost function; ii) each unit exchange its local\nvariable with its direct neighbors and then perform a weighted average. In the\nsituation where the cost function is smooth and strongly convex, our attainable\noptimization error is $O(T^{-1/2})$ after $T$ iterations. This result is\ninteresting as $O(T^{-1/2})$ is the optimal convergence rate in the ZOSCO\nproblem.

The effects of MNP amount on the concentration dependent response\nprofiles for detecting streptavidin was also investigated. Results show that by\nusing lower concentration/amount of MNPs, concentration-response curves shift\nto lower concentration/amount of target analytes. This lower\nconcentrationresponse indicates the possibility of improved bioassay\nsensitivities by using lower amounts of MNPs.",
