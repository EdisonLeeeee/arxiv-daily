    "title": "A causal learning framework for the analysis and interpretation of  COVID-19 clinical data",
    "abstract": "We present a workflow for clinical data analysis that relies on Bayesian\nStructure Learning (BSL), an unsupervised learning approach, robust to noise\nand biases, that allows to incorporate prior medical knowledge into the\nlearning process and that provides explainable results in the form of a graph\nshowing the causal connections among the analyzed features. The workflow\nconsists in a multi-step approach that goes from identifying the main causes of\npatient's outcome through BSL, to the realization of a tool suitable for\nclinical practice, based on a Binary Decision Tree (BDT), to recognize patients\nat high-risk with information available already at hospital admission time. We\nevaluate our approach on a feature-rich COVID-19 dataset, showing that the\nproposed framework provides a schematic overview of the multi-factorial\nprocesses that jointly contribute to the outcome. We discuss how these\ncomputational findings are confirmed by current understanding of the COVID-19\npathogenesis. Further, our approach yields to a highly interpretable tool\ncorrectly predicting the outcome of 85% of subjects based exclusively on 3\nfeatures: age, a previous history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and\nthe PaO2/FiO2 ratio at the time of arrival to the hospital. The inclusion of\nadditional information from 4 routine blood tests (Creatinine, Glucose, pO2 and\nSodium) increases predictive accuracy to 94.5%.",

    "title": "Optimal Virtual Network Embeddings for Tree Topologies",
    "abstract": "The performance of distributed and data-centric applications often critically\ndepends on the interconnecting network. Applications are hence modeled as\nvirtual networks, also accounting for resource demands on links. At the heart\nof provisioning such virtual networks lies the NP-hard Virtual Network\nEmbedding Problem (VNEP): how to jointly map the virtual nodes and links onto a\nphysical substrate network at minimum cost while obeying capacities.\nThis paper studies the VNEP in the light of parameterized complexity. We\nfocus on tree topology substrates, a case often encountered in practice and for\nwhich the VNEP remains NP-hard. We provide the first fixed-parameter algorithm\nfor the VNEP with running time $O(3^r (s+r^2))$ for requests and substrates of\n$r$ and $s$ nodes, respectively. In a computational study our algorithm yields\nrunning time improvements in excess of 200x compared to state-of-the-art\ninteger programming approaches. This makes it comparable in speed to the\nwell-established ViNE heuristic while providing optimal solutions. We\ncomplement our algorithmic study with hardness results for the VNEP and related\nproblems.",

Assuming the max-power association policy, we\nstudy the performance of the network in both amplify-and-forward (AF) and\ndecode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocols. Using tools from stochastic\ngeometry, we analyze the joint distribution of distance and zenith angle of the\nclosest (and serving) UAV to the origin in a 3D setting. Further, we identify\nand extensively study key mathematical constructs as the building blocks of\ncharacterizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)\ndistribution. Using these results, we obtain exact mathematical expressions for\nthe coverage probability in both AF and DF relaying protocols. Furthermore,\nconsidering the fact that backhaul links could be quite weak because of the\ndowntilted antennas at the BSs, we propose and analyze the addition of a\ndirectional uptilted antenna at the BS that is solely used for backhaul\npurposes.

Our framework can effectively learn global and local features by\ncapturing 3D spatial context and rich anatomical information.

This is not considered by\ntraditional evaluation protocols for recommenders systems, in which each\ncarousel is evaluated in isolation, regardless of (i) which other carousels are\ndisplayed to the user and (ii) the relative position of the carousel with\nrespect to other carousels. Hence, we propose a two-dimensional evaluation\nprotocol for a carousel setting that will measure the quality of a\nrecommendation carousel based on how much it improves upon the quality of an\nalready available set of carousels. Our evaluation protocol takes into account\nalso the position bias, i.e. users do not explore the carousels sequentially,\nbut rather concentrate on the top-left corner of the screen.\nWe report experiments on the movie domain and notice that under a carousel\nsetting the definition of which criteria has to be preferred to generate a list\nof recommended items changes with respect to what is commonly understood.",

The non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-i.i.d.) data\nsamples invoke discrepancy between global and local objectives, making the FL\nmodel slow to converge. In this paper, we proposed Optimal Aggregation\nalgorithm for better aggregation, which finds out the optimal subset of local\nupdates of participating nodes in each global round, by identifying and\nexcluding the adverse local updates via checking the relationship between the\nlocal gradient and the global gradient. Then, we proposed a Probabilistic Node\nSelection framework (FedPNS) to dynamically change the probability for each\nnode to be selected based on the output of Optimal Aggregation. FedPNS can\npreferentially select nodes that propel faster model convergence. The\nunbiasedness of the proposed FedPNS design is illustrated and the convergence\nrate improvement of FedPNS over the commonly adopted Federated Averaging\n(FedAvg) algorithm is analyzed theoretically.

    "abstract": "This paper considers a real-time status update system in which an energy\nharvesting (EH)-powered transmitter node observes some physical process, and\nsends its sensed measurements in the form of status updates to a destination\nnode. The status update and harvested energy packets are assumed to arrive at\nthe transmitter according to independent Poisson processes, and the service\ntime of each status update is assumed to be exponentially distributed. We\nquantify the freshness of status updates when they reach the destination using\nthe concept of Age of Information (AoI). Unlike most of the existing analyses\nof AoI focusing on the evaluation of its average value when the transmitter is\nnot subject to energy constraints, our analysis is focused on understanding the\ndistributional properties of AoI through the characterization of its moment\ngenerating function (MGF). In particular, we use the stochastic hybrid systems\n(SHS) framework to derive closed-form expressions of the MGF of AoI under\nseveral queueing disciplines at the transmitter, including non-preemptive and\npreemptive in service/waiting strategies. Using these MGF results, we further\nobtain closed-form expressions for the first and second moments of AoI in each\nqueueing discipline. We demonstrate the generality of this analysis by\nrecovering several existing results for the corresponding system with no energy\nconstraints as special cases of the new results. Our numerical results verify\nthe analytical findings, and demonstrate the necessity of incorporating the\nhigher moments of AoI in the implementation/optimization of real-time status\nupdate systems rather than just relying on its average value.",

    "abstract": "Most existing deep neural networks are static, which means they can only do\ninference at a fixed complexity. But the resource budget can vary substantially\nacross different devices. Even on a single device, the affordable budget can\nchange with different scenarios, and repeatedly training networks for each\nrequired budget would be incredibly expensive. Therefore, in this work, we\npropose a general method called MutualNet to train a single network that can\nrun at a diverse set of resource constraints. Our method trains a cohort of\nmodel configurations with various network widths and input resolutions. This\nmutual learning scheme not only allows the model to run at different\nwidth-resolution configurations but also transfers the unique knowledge among\nthese configurations, helping the model to learn stronger representations\noverall. MutualNet is a general training methodology that can be applied to\nvarious network structures (e.g., 2D networks: MobileNets, ResNet, 3D networks:\nSlowFast, X3D) and various tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection,\nsegmentation, and action recognition), and is demonstrated to achieve\nconsistent improvements on a variety of datasets. Since we only train the model\nonce, it also greatly reduces the training cost compared to independently\ntraining several models. Surprisingly, MutualNet can also be used to\nsignificantly boost the performance of a single network, if dynamic resource\nconstraint is not a concern. In summary, MutualNet is a unified method for both\nstatic and adaptive, 2D and 3D networks. Codes and pre-trained models are\navailable at \\url{https://github.com/taoyang1122/MutualNet}.",

    "abstract": "This non-conventional paper represents the first attempt to uncover a\npossible vulnerability in some proposals for optical network designs and\nperformance comparisons. While optical network designs and planning lie at the\nheart of achieving fiber capacity efficiency and/or operational efficiency, its\ncombinatorial nature makes it computationally hard to reach optimal solutions\nfor realistic scenarios. Therefore, the well-established way that have been\ntaken for granted by not-so-small number of research papers is that an\noptimization model based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is first\nproposed and then due to the intractability of such combinatorial model, an\nheuristic algorithm is offered as an approximation. The solution-quality\ncomparison between the MILP and heuristic is then carried out on small-scale\ninstances including topologies and traffic tests to verify the efficacy of the\nproposed heuristic and the next step is to use such allegedly verified\nheuristic for optical network designs of realistic scenarios. This approach may\nnevertheless leave a critical vulnerability as there is no guarantee that one\nperforms well in small tests will generalize adequately for large-scale cases,\na common pitfall widely referred as the peril of extrapolation and/or\noverfitting. Besides, it is not uncommon that in some research works, for\nbenchmarking purpose, the comparison between a new design proposal whose\nperformance is obtained from on one heuristic and a reference design based on\nanother heuristic is carried out. As the result of missing solution quality\ncheck, such performance comparison relied merely on heuristic solutions may be\nequally vulnerable as its results can be distorted and thus, be far from the\npossibly achieved zones. In this work, we pinpoint those issues and provide a\nrealistic case study to highlight and demonstrate the impact of such\nvulnerabilities.",

Our\napproach uses a network with an extra abstention class and is trained on a\ndataset that is augmented with an uncurated set that consists of a large number\nof out-of-distribution (OoD) samples that are assigned the label of the\nabstention class; the model is then trained to learn an effective discriminator\nbetween in and out-of-distribution samples. We compare this relatively simple\napproach against a wide variety of more complex methods that have been proposed\nboth for out-of-distribution detection as well as uncertainty modeling in deep\nlearning, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide variety of of\nbenchmarks and deep architectures for image recognition and text\nclassification, often outperforming existing approaches by significant margins.\nGiven the simplicity and effectiveness of this method, we propose that this\napproach be used as a new additional baseline for future work in this domain.",

These embeddings are then used to calculate the L2\ndistances as a way to measure dissimilarity. Using this deep learning method,\nUgly Ducklings are identified as outliers which should deserve more attention\nfrom the examining physician.

Most of the\npopulation protocols in the literature assume that the participating $n$ nodes\nare honest. Such assumption may not be, however, accurate for large-scale\nsystems of small devices. Hence, in this work, we study a variant of population\nprotocols, where up to $f$ nodes can be Byzantine. We examine the majority\n(binary) consensus problem against different levels of adversary strengths,\nranging from the Full adversary that has complete knowledge of all the node\nstates to the Weak adversary that has only knowledge about which exchanges take\nplace. We also take into account Dynamic vs Static node corruption by the\nadversary. We give lower bounds that require any algorithm solving the majority\nconsensus to have initial difference $d = \\Omega(f + 1)$ for the tally between\nthe two proposed values, which holds for both the Full Static and Weak Dynamic\nadversaries. We then present an algorithm that solves the majority consensus\nproblem and tolerates $f \\leq n / c$ Byzantine nodes, for some constant $c>0$,\nwith $d = \\Omega(f + \\sqrt{n \\log n})$ and $O(\\log^3 n)$ parallel time steps,\nusing $O(\\log n)$ states per node.

    "abstract": "Cross-modal hashing, favored for its effectiveness and efficiency, has\nreceived wide attention to facilitating efficient retrieval across different\nmodalities. Nevertheless, most existing methods do not sufficiently exploit the\ndiscriminative power of semantic information when learning the hash codes,\nwhile often involving time-consuming training procedure for handling the\nlarge-scale dataset. To tackle these issues, we formulate the learning of\nsimilarity-preserving hash codes in terms of orthogonally rotating the semantic\ndata so as to minimize the quantization loss of mapping such data to hamming\nspace, and propose an efficient Fast Discriminative Discrete Hashing (FDDH)\napproach for large-scale cross-modal retrieval. More specifically, FDDH\nintroduces an orthogonal basis to regress the targeted hash codes of training\nexamples to their corresponding semantic labels, and utilizes \"-dragging\ntechnique to provide provable large semantic margins. Accordingly, the\ndiscriminative power of semantic information can be explicitly captured and\nmaximized. Moreover, an orthogonal transformation scheme is further proposed to\nmap the nonlinear embedding data into the semantic subspace, which can well\nguarantee the semantic consistency between the data feature and its semantic\nrepresentation. Consequently, an efficient closed form solution is derived for\ndiscriminative hash code learning, which is very computationally efficient. In\naddition, an effective and stable online learning strategy is presented for\noptimizing modality-specific projection functions, featuring adaptivity to\ndifferent training sizes and streaming data. The proposed FDDH approach\ntheoretically approximates the bi-Lipschitz continuity, runs sufficiently fast,\nand also significantly improves the retrieval performance over the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Apparently, the hardware architecture design process is\nspecific and time-consuming for each NN. Therefore, a systematic way to design,\nimplement and optimize NNs is highly demanded. The paper presents a systematic\napproach to implement state-space models in register transfer level (RTL), with\nspecial interest for NN implementation.

It can also be used\nto implement either intrinsically iterative systems (widely used in various\ndomains such as signal processing, numerical analysis, computer arithmetic, and\ncontrol engineering), or systems that could be rewritten in equivalent\niterative forms. The implementation of recurrent NNs such as long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) NNs, which have intrinsic state-space forms, are another major\napplications for this framework.

Moreover, dilated convolution provides global\nfeatures of hand gestures through a larger receptive field.

    "abstract": "The uniform information density (UID) hypothesis, which posits that speakers\nprefer utterances that distribute information uniformly across the signal, has\ngained substantial traction in psycholinguistics as an explanation for certain\nsyntactic, morphological, and prosodic choices. Could we operationalize uniform\ninformation density as an inductive bias for statistical language modeling? In\nthis paper, we augment the canonical MLE objective for training language models\nby encoding UID as regularization. In experiments on ten languages spanning\nfive language families, we find that using UID regularization consistently\nimproves perplexity in language models, having a larger effect when training\ndata is limited. Moreover, via analysis of generated sequences, we find that\nUID-regularized language models are higher-entropy and produce text that is\nlonger and more lexically diverse. Our results not only suggest that UID is a\nreasonable inductive bias for language modeling, but also provide an\nalternative validation of the UID hypothesis using modern-day NLP tools.",

    "abstract": "As more robots are implemented for contact-rich tasks, tactile sensors are in\nincreasing demand. For many circumstances, the contact is required to be\ncompliant, and soft sensors are in need. This paper introduces a novelly\ndesigned soft sensor that can simultaneously estimate the contact force and\ncontact location. Inspired by humans' skin, which contains multi-layers of\nreceptors, the designed tactile sensor has a dual-layer structure. The first\nlayer is made of a conductive fabric that is responsible for sensing the\ncontact force. The second layer is composed of four small conductive rubbers\nthat can detect the contact location. Signals from the two layers are firstly\nprocessed by Wheatstone bridges and amplifier circuits so that the measurement\nnoises are eliminated, and the sensitivity is improved. An Arduino chip is used\nfor processing the signal and analyzing the data. The contact force can be\nobtained by a pre-trained model that maps from the voltage to force, and the\ncontact location is estimated by the voltage signal from the conductive rubbers\nin the second layer. In addition, filtering methods are applied to eliminate\nthe estimation noise. Finally, experiments are provided to show the accuracy\nand robustness of the sensor.",

In this paper, we present\nFloorPlanCAD, a large-scale real-world CAD drawing dataset containing over\n10,000 floor plans, ranging from residential to commercial buildings. CAD\ndrawings in the dataset are all represented as vector graphics, which enable us\nto provide line-grained annotations of 30 object categories. Equipped by such\nannotations, we introduce the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which requires\nto spot not only instances of countable things, but also the semantic of\nuncountable stuff. Aiming to solve this task, we propose a novel method by\ncombining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), which captures both non-Euclidean and Euclidean features and\ncan be trained end-to-end. The proposed CNN-GCN method achieved\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the task of semantic symbol spotting,\nand help us build a baseline network for the panoptic symbol spotting task. Our\ncontributions are three-fold: 1) to the best of our knowledge, the presented\nCAD drawing dataset is the first of its kind; 2) the panoptic symbol spotting\ntask considers the spotting of both thing instances and stuff semantic as one\nrecognition problem; and 3) we presented a baseline solution to the panoptic\nsymbol spotting task based on a novel CNN-GCN method, which achieved SOTA\nperformance on semantic symbol spotting.

However, we argue that there are gaps between the\npredictor and the estimator in both data quality and training objectives, which\npreclude QE models from benefiting from a large number of parallel corpora more\ndirectly. We propose a novel framework called DirectQE that provides a direct\npretraining for QE tasks. In DirectQE, a generator is trained to produce pseudo\ndata that is closer to the real QE data, and a detector is pretrained on these\ndata with novel objectives that are akin to the QE task. Experiments on widely\nused benchmarks show that DirectQE outperforms existing methods, without using\nany pretraining models such as BERT.

Usually, it requires a DSLR camera\nwith different aperture and shutter settings and certain photography skills to\ngenerate this effect. In smartphones, computational methods and additional\nsensors are used to overcome the physical lens and sensor limitations to\nachieve such effect. Most of the existing methods utilized additional sensor's\ndata or pretrained network for fine depth estimation of the scene and sometimes\nuse portrait segmentation pretrained network module to segment salient objects\nin the image. Because of these reasons, networks have many parameters, become\nruntime intensive and unable to run in mid-range devices. In this paper, we\nused an end-to-end Deep Multi-Scale Hierarchical Network (DMSHN) model for\ndirect Bokeh effect rendering of images captured from the monocular camera. To\nfurther improve the perceptual quality of such effect, a stacked model\nconsisting of two DMSHN modules is also proposed. Our model does not rely on\nany pretrained network module for Monocular Depth Estimation or Saliency\nDetection, thus significantly reducing the size of model and run time.

    "abstract": "Given a natural language expression and an image/video, the goal of referring\nsegmentation is to produce the pixel-level masks of the entities described by\nthe subject of the expression. Previous approaches tackle this problem by\nimplicit feature interaction and fusion between visual and linguistic\nmodalities in a one-stage manner. However, human tends to solve the referring\nproblem in a progressive manner based on informative words in the expression,\ni.e., first roughly locating candidate entities and then distinguishing the\ntarget one. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Modal Progressive Comprehension\n(CMPC) scheme to effectively mimic human behaviors and implement it as a CMPC-I\n(Image) module and a CMPC-V (Video) module to improve referring image and video\nsegmentation models. For image data, our CMPC-I module first employs entity and\nattribute words to perceive all the related entities that might be considered\nby the expression. Then, the relational words are adopted to highlight the\ntarget entity as well as suppress other irrelevant ones by spatial graph\nreasoning. For video data, our CMPC-V module further exploits action words\nbased on CMPC-I to highlight the correct entity matched with the action cues by\ntemporal graph reasoning. In addition to the CMPC, we also introduce a simple\nyet effective Text-Guided Feature Exchange (TGFE) module to integrate the\nreasoned multimodal features corresponding to different levels in the visual\nbackbone under the guidance of textual information. In this way, multi-level\nfeatures can communicate with each other and be mutually refined based on the\ntextual context. Combining CMPC-I or CMPC-V with TGFE can form our image or\nvideo version referring segmentation frameworks and our frameworks achieve new\nstate-of-the-art performances on four referring image segmentation benchmarks\nand three referring video segmentation benchmarks respectively.",

    "abstract": "Due to the brittle feature of carbon fiber reinforced plastic laminates,\nmechanical multi-joint within these composite components show uneven load\ndistribution for each bolt, which weaken the strength advantage of composite\nlaminates. In order to reduce this defect and achieve the goal of even load\ndistribution in mechanical joints, we propose a machine learning-based\nframework as an optimization method. Since that the friction effect has been\nproven to be a significant factor in determining bolt load distribution, our\nframework aims at providing optimal parameters including bolt-hole clearances\nand tightening torques for a minimum unevenness of bolt load. A novel circuit\nmodel is established to generate data samples for the training of artificial\nnetworks at a relatively low computational cost. A database for all the\npossible inputs in the design space is built through the machine learning\nmodel. The optimal dataset of clearances and torques provided by the database\nis validated by both the finite element method, circuit model, and an\nexperimental measurement based on the linear superposition principle, which\nshows the effectiveness of this general framework for the optimization problem.\nThen, our machine learning model is further compared and worked in\ncollaboration with commonly used optimization algorithms, which shows the\npotential of greatly increasing computational efficiency for the inverse design\nproblem.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers joint learning of multiple sparse Granger graphical\nmodels to discover underlying common and differential Granger causality (GC)\nstructures across multiple time series. This can be applied to drawing\ngroup-level brain connectivity inferences from a homogeneous group of subjects\nor discovering network differences among groups of signals collected under\nheterogeneous conditions. By recognizing that the GC of a single multivariate\ntime series can be characterized by common zeros of vector autoregressive (VAR)\nlag coefficients, a group sparse prior is included in joint regularized\nleast-squares estimations of multiple VAR models. Group-norm regularizations\nbased on group- and fused-lasso penalties encourage a decomposition of multiple\nnetworks into a common GC structure, with other remaining parts defined in\nindividual-specific networks. Prior information about sparseness and sparsity\npatterns of desired GC networks are incorporated as relative weights, while a\nnon-convex group norm in the penalty is proposed to enhance the accuracy of\nnetwork estimation in low-sample settings. Extensive numerical results on\nsimulations illustrated our method's improvements over existing sparse\nestimation approaches on GC network sparsity recovery. Our methods were also\napplied to available resting-state fMRI time series from the ADHD-200 data sets\nto learn the differences of causality mechanisms, called effective brain\nconnectivity, between adolescents with ADHD and typically developing children.\nOur analysis revealed that parts of the causality differences between the two\ngroups often resided in the orbitofrontal region and areas associated with the\nlimbic system, which agreed with clinical findings and data-driven results in\nprevious studies.",

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning models for computer vision exceed humans in accuracy\non specific visual recognition tasks, notably on datasets like ImageNet.\nHowever, high accuracy can be achieved in many ways. The particular decision\nfunction found by a machine learning system is determined not only by the data\nto which the system is exposed, but also the inductive biases of the model,\nwhich are typically harder to characterize. In this work, we follow a recent\ntrend of in-depth behavioral analyses of neural network models that go beyond\naccuracy as an evaluation metric by looking at patterns of errors. Our focus is\non comparing a suite of standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a\nrecently-proposed attention-based network, the Vision Transformer (ViT), which\nrelaxes the translation-invariance constraint of CNNs and therefore represents\na model with a weaker set of inductive biases. Attention-based networks have\npreviously been shown to achieve higher accuracy than CNNs on vision tasks, and\nwe demonstrate, using new metrics for examining error consistency with more\ngranularity, that their errors are also more consistent with those of humans.\nThese results have implications both for building more human-like vision\nmodels, as well as for understanding visual object recognition in humans.",

    "abstract": "Determining I/O lower bounds is a crucial step in obtaining\ncommunication-efficient parallel algorithms, both across the memory hierarchy\nand between processors. Current approaches either study specific algorithms\nindividually, disallow programmatic motifs such as recomputation, or produce\nasymptotic bounds that exclude important constants. We propose a novel approach\nfor obtaining precise I/O lower bounds on a general class of programs, which we\ncall Simple Overlap Access Programs (SOAP). SOAP analysis covers a wide variety\nof algorithms, from ubiquitous computational kernels to full scientific\ncomputing applications. Using the red-blue pebble game and combinatorial\nmethods, we are able to bound the I/O of the SOAP-induced Computational\nDirected Acyclic Graph (CDAG), taking into account multiple statements,\ninput/output reuse, and optimal tiling. To deal with programs that are outside\nof our representation (e.g., non-injective access functions), we describe\nmethods to approximate them with SOAP. To demonstrate our method, we analyze 38\ndifferent applications, including kernels from the Polybench benchmark suite,\ndeep learning operators, and -- for the first time -- applications in\nunstructured physics simulations, numerical weather prediction stencil\ncompositions, and full deep neural networks. We derive tight I/O bounds for\nseveral linear algebra kernels, such as Cholesky decomposition, improving the\nexisting reported bounds by a factor of two.

CPDP\ntrained classifiers based on labeled data sets of one project to predict fault\nin another project. Goals: Software Defect Prediction (SDP) data sets consist\nof manually designed static features, which are software metrics. In CPDP,\nsource and target project data divergence is the major challenge in achieving\nhigh performance. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network\n(GAN)-based data transformation to reduce data divergence between source and\ntarget projects. Method: We apply the Generative Adversarial Method where label\ndata sets are choosing as real data, while target data sets are choosing as\nfake data. The Discriminator tries to measure the perfection of domain\nadaptation through loss function. Through the generator, target data sets try\nto adapt the source project domain and, finally, apply machine learning\nclassifier (i.e., Naive Bayes) to classify faulty modules. Results: Our result\nshows that it is possible to predict defects based on the Generative\nAdversarial Method.

    "abstract": "We study Nonpreemptive Peak Demand Minimization (NPDM) problem, where we are\ngiven a set of jobs, specified by their processing times and energy\nrequirements. The goal is to schedule all jobs within a fixed time period such\nthat the peak load (the maximum total energy requirement at any time) is\nminimized. This problem has recently received significant attention due to its\nrelevance in smart-grids. Theoretically, the problem is related to the\nclassical strip packing problem (SP). In SP, a given set of axis-aligned\nrectangles must be packed into a fixed-width strip, such that the height of the\nstrip is minimized. NPDM can be modeled as strip packing with slicing and\nstacking constraint: each rectangle may be cut vertically into multiple slices\nand the slices may be packed into the strip as individual pieces. The stacking\nconstraint forbids solutions where two slices of the same rectangle are\nintersected by the same vertical line. Nonpreemption enforces the slices to be\nplaced in contiguous horizontal locations (but may be placed at different\nvertical locations).\nWe obtain a $(5/3+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the problem. We also\nprovide an asymptotic efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme (AEPTAS)\nwhich generates a schedule for almost all jobs with energy consumption\n$(1+\\epsilon)OPT$. The remaining jobs fit into a thin container of height $1$.\nThe previous best for NPDM was 2.7 approximation based on FFDH [Ranjan et al.\n2015]. One of our key ideas is providing several new lower bounds on the\noptimal solution of a geometric packing, which could be useful in other related\nproblems. These lower bounds help us to obtain approximative solutions based on\nSteinberg's algorithm in many cases. In addition, we show how to split\nschedules generated by the AEPTAS into few segments and to rearrange the\ncorresponding jobs to insert the thin container mentioned above.",

    "abstract": "Kernel based methods yield approximation models that are flexible, efficient\nand powerful. In particular, they utilize fixed feature maps of the data, being\noften associated to strong analytical results that prove their accuracy. On the\nother hand, the recent success of machine learning methods has been driven by\ndeep neural networks (NNs). They achieve a significant accuracy on very\nhigh-dimensional data, in that they are able to learn also efficient data\nrepresentations or data-based feature maps. In this paper, we leverage a recent\ndeep kernel representer theorem to connect the two approaches and understand\ntheir interplay. In particular, we show that the use of special types of\nkernels yield models reminiscent of neural networks that are founded in the\nsame theoretical framework of classical kernel methods, while enjoying many\ncomputational properties of deep neural networks. Especially the introduced\nStructured Deep Kernel Networks (SDKNs) can be viewed as neural networks with\noptimizable activation functions obeying a representer theorem. Analytic\nproperties show their universal approximation properties in different\nasymptotic regimes of unbounded number of centers, width and depth. Especially\nin the case of unbounded depth, the constructions is asymptotically better than\ncorresponding constructions for ReLU neural networks, which is made possible by\nthe flexibility of kernel approximation",

Constrained matrix\nzonotopes are introduced to provide less conservative reachable sets at the\ncost of increased computational expenses and utilized to incorporate prior\nknowledge about the unknown system model.

Recent works have shown that community-aware centrality\nmeasures compare favorably with classical measures agnostic about this\nubiquitous property.

To this end, in this paper, we perform an\nextensive investigation to get a better understanding of the relationship\nbetween classical and community-aware centrality measures reported in the\nliterature.

We sought to create a conceptual framework to describe\nand classify data about presence, the domain of interpersonal connection in\nmedicine.\nMethods Our top down approach for ontology development based on the concept\nof relationality included 1) broad survey of social sciences literature and\nsystematic literature review of more than 20,000 articles around interpersonal\nconnection in medicine, 3) relational ethnography of clinical encounters (5\npilot, 27 full) and 4) interviews about relational work with 40 medical and\nnonmedical professionals. We formalized the model using the Web Ontology\nLanguage in the Protege ontology editor. We iteratively evaluated and refined\nthe Presence Ontology through manual expert review and automated annotation of\nliterature.\nResults and Discussion The Presence Ontology facilitates the naming and\nclassification of concepts that would otherwise be vague. Our model categorizes\ncontributors to healthcare encounters and factors such as Communication,\nEmotions, Tools, and Environment. Ontology evaluation indicated that Cognitive\nModels (both patients explanatory models and providers caregiving approaches)\ninfluenced encounters and were subsequently incorporated. We show how\nethnographic methods based in relationality can aid the representation of\nexperiential concepts (e.g., empathy, trust). Our ontology could support\ninformatics applications to improve healthcare such annotation of videotaped\nencounters, clinical instruments to measure presence, or EHR based reminders\nfor providers.\nConclusion The Presence Ontology provides a model for using ethnographic\napproaches to classify interpersonal data.",

    "abstract": "Age progression and regression aim to synthesize photorealistic appearance of\na given face image with aging and rejuvenation effects, respectively. Existing\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) based methods suffer from the following\nthree major issues: 1) unstable training introducing strong ghost artifacts in\nthe generated faces, 2) unpaired training leading to unexpected changes in\nfacial attributes such as genders and races, and 3) non-bijective age mappings\nincreasing the uncertainty in the face transformation. To overcome these\nissues, this paper proposes a novel framework, termed AgeFlow, to integrate the\nadvantages of both flow-based models and GANs. The proposed AgeFlow contains\nthree parts: an encoder that maps a given face to a latent space through an\ninvertible neural network, a novel invertible conditional translation module\n(ICTM) that translates the source latent vector to target one, and a decoder\nthat reconstructs the generated face from the target latent vector using the\nsame encoder network; all parts are invertible achieving bijective age\nmappings. The novelties of ICTM are two-fold. First, we propose an\nattribute-aware knowledge distillation to learn the manipulation direction of\nage progression while keeping other unrelated attributes unchanged, alleviating\nunexpected changes in facial attributes. Second, we propose to use GANs in the\nlatent space to ensure the learned latent vector indistinguishable from the\nreal ones, which is much easier than traditional use of GANs in the image\ndomain. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over existing\nGANs-based methods on two benchmarked datasets. The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Hzzone/AgeFlow.",

    "abstract": "Advances in the realm of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have led to\narchitectures capable of producing amazingly realistic images such as\nStyleGAN2, which, when trained on the FFHQ dataset, generates images of human\nfaces from random vectors in a lower-dimensional latent space. Unfortunately,\nthis space is entangled - translating a latent vector along its axes does not\ncorrespond to a meaningful transformation in the output space (e.g., smiling\nmouth, squinting eyes). The model behaves as a black box, providing neither\ncontrol over its output nor insight into the structures it has learned from the\ndata. We present a method to explore the manifolds of changes of spatially\nlocalized regions of the face. Our method discovers smoothly varying sequences\nof latent vectors along these manifolds suitable for creating animations.\nUnlike existing disentanglement methods that either require labelled data or\nexplicitly alter internal model parameters, our method is an optimization-based\napproach guided by a custom loss function and manually defined region of\nchange. Our code is open-sourced, which can be found, along with supplementary\nresults, on our project page: https://github.com/bmolab/masked-gan-manifold",

    "abstract": "We consider the broad problem of analyzing safety properties of asynchronous\nconcurrent programs under arbitrary thread interleavings. Delay-bounded\ndeterministic scheduling, introduced in prior work, is an efficient bug-finding\ntechnique to curb the large cost associated with full scheduling\nnondeterminism. In this paper we first present a technique to lift the delay\nbound for the case of finite-domain variable programs, thus adding to the\nefficiency of bug detection the ability to prove safety of programs under\narbitrary thread interleavings. Second, we demonstrate how, combined with\npredicate abstraction, our technique can both refute and verify safety\nproperties of programs with unbounded variable domains, even for unbounded\nthread counts. Previous work has established that, for non-trivial concurrency\nroutines, predicate abstraction induces a highly complex abstract program\nsemantics. Our technique, however, never statically constructs an abstract\nparametric program; it only requires some abstract-states set to be closed\nunder certain actions, thus eliminating the dependence on the existence of\nverification algorithms for abstract programs. We demonstrate the efficiency of\nour technique on many examples used in prior work, and showcase its simplicity\ncompared to earlier approaches on the unbounded-thread Ticket Lock protocol.",

    "abstract": "In this letter, we consider a distributed submodular maximization problem for\nmulti-robot systems when attacked by adversaries. One of the major challenges\nfor multi-robot systems is to increase resilience against failures or attacks.\nThis is particularly important for distributed systems under attack as there is\nno central point of command that can detect, mitigate, and recover from\nattacks. Instead, a distributed multi-robot system must coordinate effectively\nto overcome adversarial attacks. In this work, our distributed submodular\naction selection problem models a broad set of scenarios where each robot in a\nmulti-robot system has multiple action selections that may fulfill a global\nobjective, such as exploration or target tracking. To increase resilience in\nthis context, we propose a fully distributed algorithm to guide each robot's\naction selection when the system is attacked. The proposed algorithm guarantees\nperformance in a worst-case scenario where up to a portion of the robots\nmalfunction due to attacks. Importantly, the proposed algorithm is also\nconsistent, as it is shown to converge to the same solution as a centralized\nmethod. Finally, a distributed resilient multi-robot exploration problem is\npresented to confirm the performance of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "APR techniques can be extremely time consuming since (1) a large number of\npatches can be generated for a given bug, and (2) each patch needs to be\nexecuted on the original tests to ensure its correctness. In the literature,\nvarious techniques (e.g., based on learning, mining, and constraint solving)\nhave been proposed/studied to reduce the number of patches. However, there is\nlimited study on the impact of test selection for each patch (e.g., only the\ntests affected by the patch need to be executed as the other tests would keep\nthe same outcomes and can be skipped), and few APR systems actually apply test\nselection. Therefore, this paper conducts the first extensive study to\ninvestigate the impact of Regression Test Selection (RTS) on APR. More\nspecifically, we implemented widely-used RTS techniques at different levels for\n12 state-of-the-art APR systems with over 2M patches. Our study reveals various\npractical guidelines for future APR, including: (1) the number of patches\nwidely used for measuring APR efficiency can incur skewed conclusions, and the\nuse of inconsistent RTS configurations can further skew the conclusion; (2) all\nstudied RTS techniques can substantially improve APR efficiency and should be\nconsidered in future APR work; (3) method- and statement-level RTS outperform\nclass-level RTS substantially, and should be preferred; (4) RTS techniques can\nsubstantially outperform state-of-the-art test prioritization techniques for\nAPR, and combining them can further improve APR efficiency; and (5) traditional\nregression test prioritization widely studied in regression testing performs\neven better than APR-specific test prioritization when combined with most RTS\ntechniques.

We let the workers run multiple such iterations locally and\ncommunicate the models to the master node only once every few (say L)\niterations. LocalNewton is highly practical since it requires only one\nhyperparameter, the number L of local iterations. We use novel matrix\nconcentration-based techniques to obtain theoretical guarantees for\nLocalNewton, and we validate them with detailed empirical evaluation. To\nenhance practicability, we devise an adaptive scheme to choose L, and we show\nthat this reduces the number of local iterations in worker machines between two\nmodel synchronizations as the training proceeds, successively refining the\nmodel quality at the master. Via extensive experiments using several real-world\ndatasets with AWS Lambda workers and an AWS EC2 master, we show that\nLocalNewton requires fewer than 60% of the communication rounds (between master\nand workers) and less than 40% of the end-to-end running time, compared to\nstate-of-the-art algorithms, to reach the same training~loss.",

The calibration\ndata usually comes from the training dataset which could be inaccessible due to\nsensitivity of the data. In this work, we want to study such a problem: can we\nuse out-of-domain data to calibrate the trained networks without knowledge of\nthe original dataset? Specifically, we go beyond the domain of natural images\nto include drastically different domains such as X-ray images, satellite images\nand ultrasound images. We find cross-domain calibration leads to surprisingly\nstable performance of quantized models on 10 tasks in different image domains\nwith 13 different calibration datasets. We also find that the performance of\nquantized models is correlated with the similarity of the Gram matrices between\nthe source and calibration domains, which can be used as a criterion to choose\ncalibration set for better performance.

    "abstract": "For a map (function) $F(x):\\ftwo^n\\rightarrow\\ftwo^n$ and a given $y$ in the\nimage of $F$ the problem of \\emph{local inversion} of $F$ is to find all\ninverse images $x$ in $\\ftwo^n$ such that $y=F(x)$. In Cryptology, such a\nproblem arises in Cryptanalysis of One way Functions (OWFs). The well known\nTMTO attack in Cryptanalysis is a probabilistic algorithm for computing one\nsolution of local inversion using $O(\\sqrt N)$ order computation in offline as\nwell as online for $N=2^n$. This paper proposes a complete algorithm for\nsolving the local inversion problem which uses linear complexity for a unique\nsolution in a periodic orbit. The algorithm is shown to require an offline\ncomputation to solve a hard problem (possibly requiring exponential\ncomputation) and an online computation dependent on $y$ that of repeated\nforward evaluation $F(x)$ on points $x$ in $\\ff_{2^n}$ which is polynomial time\nat each evaluation. However the forward evaluation is repeated at most as many\nnumber of times as the Linear Complexity of the sequence $\\{y,F(y),\\ldots\\}$ to\nget one possible solution when this sequence is periodic. All other solutions\nare obtained in chains $\\{e,F(e),\\ldots\\}$ for all points $e$ in the Garden of\nEden (GOE) of the map $F$. Hence a solution $x$ exists iff either the former\nsequence is periodic or a solution occurs in a chain starting from a point in\nGOE. The online computation then turns out to be polynomial time $O(L^k)$ in\nthe linear complexity $L$ of the sequence to compute one possible solution in a\nperiodic orbit or $O(l)$ the chain length for a fixed $n$. Hence this is a\ncomplete algorithm for solving the problem of finding all rational solutions\n$x$ of the equation $F(x)=y$ for a given $y$ and a map $F$ in $\\ff_{2^n}$.",

Recent work attempts to mitigate such\nproblems by augmenting training of deep anomaly detection models with\nadditional labeled anomaly samples. However, the labeled data often does not\nalign with the target distribution and introduces harmful bias to the trained\nmodel. In this paper, we aim to understand the effect of a biased anomaly set\non anomaly detection. Concretely, we view anomaly detection as a supervised\nlearning task where the objective is to optimize the recall at a given false\npositive rate. We formally study the relative scoring bias of an anomaly\ndetector, defined as the difference in performance with respect to a baseline\nanomaly detector. We establish the first finite sample rates for estimating the\nrelative scoring bias for deep anomaly detection, and empirically validate our\ntheoretical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We also provide\nan extensive empirical study on how a biased training anomaly set affects the\nanomaly score function and therefore the detection performance on different\nanomaly classes. Our study demonstrates scenarios in which the biased anomaly\nset can be useful or problematic, and provides a solid benchmark for future\nresearch.",

    "title": "BDANet: Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network with Cross-directional  Attention for Building Damage Assessment from Satellite Images",
    "abstract": "Fast and effective responses are required when a natural disaster (e.g.,\nearthquake, hurricane, etc.) strikes. Building damage assessment from satellite\nimagery is critical before relief effort is deployed. With a pair of pre- and\npost-disaster satellite images, building damage assessment aims at predicting\nthe extent of damage to buildings. With the powerful ability of feature\nrepresentation, deep neural networks have been successfully applied to building\ndamage assessment. Most existing works simply concatenate pre- and\npost-disaster images as input of a deep neural network without considering\ntheir correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage convolutional\nneural network for Building Damage Assessment, called BDANet. In the first\nstage, a U-Net is used to extract the locations of buildings. Then the network\nweights from the first stage are shared in the second stage for building damage\nassessment. In the second stage, a two-branch multi-scale U-Net is employed as\nbackbone, where pre- and post-disaster images are fed into the network\nseparately. A cross-directional attention module is proposed to explore the\ncorrelations between pre- and post-disaster images. Moreover, CutMix data\naugmentation is exploited to tackle the challenge of difficult classes. The\nproposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large-scale dataset\n-- xBD.

    "abstract": "Context: In addressing how best to estimate how much effort is required to\ndevelop software, a recent study found that using exemplary and recently\ncompleted projects [forming Bellwether moving windows (BMW)] in software effort\nprediction (SEP) models leads to relatively improved accuracy. More studies\nneed to be conducted to determine whether the BMW yields improved accuracy in\ngeneral, since different sizing and aging parameters of the BMW are known to\naffect accuracy. Objective: To investigate the existence of exemplary projects\n(Bellwethers) with defined window size and age parameters, and whether their\nuse in SEP improves prediction accuracy. Method: We empirically investigate the\nmoving window assumption based on the theory that the prediction outcome of a\nfuture event depends on the outcomes of prior events. Sampling of Bellwethers\nwas undertaken using three introduced Bellwether methods (SSPM, SysSam, and\nRandSam). The ergodic Markov chain was used to determine the stationarity of\nthe Bell-wethers. Results: Empirical results show that 1) Bellwethers exist in\nSEP and 2) the BMW has an approximate size of 50 to 80 exemplary projects that\nshould not be more than 2 years old relative to the new projects to be\nestimated. Conclusion: The study's results add further weight to the\nrecommended use of Bellwethers for improved prediction accuracy in SEP.",

Examples are medical assistant systems, and applications\nconcerned with the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union,\nwhich features transparency as a cornerstone. Such demands require the ability\nto audit the rationale behind a classifier's decision. While visualizations are\nthe de facto standard of explanations, they come short in terms of\nexpressiveness in many ways: They cannot distinguish between different\nattribute manifestations of visual features (e.g. eye open vs. closed), and\nthey cannot accurately describe the influence of absence of, and relations\nbetween features. An alternative would be more expressive symbolic surrogate\nmodels. However, these require symbolic inputs, which are not readily available\nin most computer vision tasks. In this paper we investigate how to overcome\nthis: We use inherent features learned by the network to build a global,\nexpressive, verbal explanation of the rationale of a feed-forward convolutional\ndeep neural network (DNN). The semantics of the features are mined by a concept\nanalysis approach trained on a set of human understandable visual concepts. The\nexplanation is found by an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) method and\npresented as first-order rules.

    "abstract": "As users often express their preferences with binary behavior data~(implicit\nfeedback), such as clicking items or buying products, implicit feedback based\nCollaborative Filtering~(CF) models predict the top ranked items a user might\nlike by leveraging implicit user-item interaction data. For each user, the\nimplicit feedback is divided into two sets: an observed item set with limited\nobserved behaviors, and a large unobserved item set that is mixed with negative\nitem behaviors and unknown behaviors. Given any user preference prediction\nmodel, researchers either designed ranking based optimization goals or relied\non negative item mining techniques for better optimization. Despite the\nperformance gain of these implicit feedback based models, the recommendation\nresults are still far from satisfactory due to the sparsity of the observed\nitem set for each user. To this end, in this paper, we explore the unique\ncharacteristics of the implicit feedback and propose Set2setRank framework for\nrecommendation. The optimization criteria of Set2setRank are two folds: First,\nwe design an item to an item set comparison that encourages each observed item\nfrom the sampled observed set is ranked higher than any unobserved item from\nthe sampled unobserved set. Second, we model set level comparison that\nencourages a margin between the distance summarized from the observed item set\nand the most \"hard\" unobserved item from the sampled negative set. Further, an\nadaptive sampling technique is designed to implement these two goals. We have\nto note that our proposed framework is model-agnostic and can be easily applied\nto most recommendation prediction approaches, and is time efficient in\npractice. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge\nfrom pre-trained teacher models to (usually more lightweight) student models.\nHowever, in certain situations, this technique is more of a curse than a\nblessing. For instance, KD poses a potential risk of exposing intellectual\nproperties (IPs): even if a trained machine learning model is released in\n'black boxes' (e.g., as executable software or APIs without open-sourcing\ncode), it can still be replicated by KD through imitating input-output\nbehaviors. To prevent this unwanted effect of KD, this paper introduces and\ninvestigates a concept called Nasty Teacher: a specially trained teacher\nnetwork that yields nearly the same performance as a normal one, but would\nsignificantly degrade the performance of student models learned by imitating\nit. We propose a simple yet effective algorithm to build the nasty teacher,\ncalled self-undermining knowledge distillation. Specifically, we aim to\nmaximize the difference between the output of the nasty teacher and a normal\npre-trained network. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that\nour method is effective on both standard KD and data-free KD, providing the\ndesirable KD-immunity to model owners for the first time.

In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy, termed as\nSemi-supervised Contrastive Learning (SsCL), which combines the well-known\ncontrastive loss in self-supervised learning with the cross entropy loss in\nsemi-supervised learning, and jointly optimizes the two objectives in an\nend-to-end way. The highlight is that different from self-training based\nsemi-supervised learning that conducts prediction and retraining over the same\nmodel weights, SsCL interchanges the predictions over the unlabeled data\nbetween the two branches, and thus formulates a co-calibration procedure, which\nwe find is beneficial for better prediction and avoid being trapped in local\nminimum. Towards this goal, the contrastive loss branch models pairwise\nsimilarities among samples, using the nearest neighborhood generated from the\ncross entropy branch, and in turn calibrates the prediction distribution of the\ncross entropy branch with the contrastive similarity. We show that SsCL\nproduces more discriminative representation and is beneficial to few shot\nlearning. Notably, on ImageNet with ResNet50 as the backbone, SsCL achieves\n60.2% and 72.1% top-1 accuracy with 1% and 10% labeled samples, respectively,\nwhich significantly outperforms the baseline, and is better than previous\nsemi-supervised and self-supervised methods.",

The\nalgorithm is based on sketching the matrix with random matrices from both left\nand right; the key fact is that with high probability, the sketches preserve\nthe orders of magnitude of the leading singular values. The rank can hence be\ntaken to be the number of singular values of the sketch that are larger than\nthe prescribed threshold. For an $m\\times n$ $(m\\geq n)$ matrix of numerical\nrank $r$, the algorithm runs with complexity $O(mn\\log n+r^3)$, or less for\nstructured matrices.

    "abstract": "We analyze, from the viewpoint of positivity preservation, certain\ndiscretizations of a fundamental partial differential equation, the\none-dimensional advection equation with periodic boundary condition. The full\ndiscretization is obtained by coupling a finite difference spatial\nsemi-discretization (the second- and some higher-order centered difference\nschemes, or the Fourier spectral collocation method) with an arbitrary\n$\\theta$-method in time (including the forward and backward Euler methods, and\na second-order method by choosing $\\theta\\in [0,1]$ suitably). The full\ndiscretization generates a two-parameter family of circulant matrices\n$M\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times m}$, where each matrix entry is a rational function in\n$\\theta$ and $\\nu$. Here, $\\nu$ denotes the CFL number, being proportional to\nthe ratio between the temporal and spatial discretization step sizes. The\nentrywise non-negativity of the matrix $M$ -- which is equivalent to the\npositivity preservation of the fully discrete scheme -- is investigated via\ndiscrete Fourier analysis and also by solving some low-order parametric linear\nrecursions. We find that positivity preservation of the fully discrete system\nis impossible if the number of spatial grid points $m$ is even. However, it\nturns out that positivity preservation of the fully discrete system is\nrecovered for \\emph{odd} values of $m$ provided that $\\theta\\ge 1/2$ and $\\nu$\nare chosen suitably. These results are interesting since the systems of\nordinary differential equations obtained via the spatial semi-discretizations\nstudied are \\emph{not} positivity preserving.",

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal action detection is an important and challenging problem in\nvideo understanding. The existing action detection benchmarks are limited in\naspects of small numbers of instances in a trimmed video or relatively\nlow-level atomic actions. This paper aims to present a new multi-person dataset\nof spatio-temporal localized sports actions, coined as MultiSports. We first\nanalyze the important ingredients of constructing a realistic and challenging\ndataset for spatio-temporal action detection by proposing three criteria: (1)\nmotion dependent identification, (2) with well-defined boundaries, (3)\nrelatively high-level classes. Based on these guidelines, we build the dataset\nof Multi-Sports v1.0 by selecting 4 sports classes, collecting around 3200\nvideo clips, and annotating around 37790 action instances with 907k bounding\nboxes. Our datasets are characterized with important properties of strong\ndiversity, detailed annotation, and high quality. Our MultiSports, with its\nrealistic setting and dense annotations, exposes the intrinsic challenge of\naction localization. To benchmark this, we adapt several representative methods\nto our dataset and give an in-depth analysis on the difficulty of action\nlocalization in our dataset. We hope our MultiSports can serve as a standard\nbenchmark for spatio-temporal action detection in the future. Our dataset\nwebsite is at https://deeperaction.github.io/multisports/.",

This situation is unsatisfactory especially when compared to the\ncase of the data-independent $P$-greedy algorithm, for which optimal\nconvergence rates are available, despite its performances being usually\ninferior to the ones of target data-dependent algorithms.\nIn this work we fill this gap by first defining a new scale of greedy\nalgorithms for interpolation that comprises all the existing ones in a unique\nanalysis, where the degree of dependency of the selection criterion on the\nfunctional data is quantified by a real parameter. We then prove new\nconvergence rates where this degree is taken into account and we show that,\npossibly up to a logarithmic factor, target data-dependent selection strategies\nprovide faster convergence.\nIn particular, for the first time we obtain convergence rates for target data\nadaptive interpolation that are faster than the ones given by uniform points,\nwithout the need of any special assumption on the target function.

    "abstract": "CSI (Channel State Information) of WiFi systems has become a hot topic in\nrecent years. The information contains the environment channel response between\nthe transmitter and the receiver, so that the people/objects and their movement\nin between can be detected by analyzing CSI. CSI is the channel estimation\nresult in the receiver based on the pre-known training field of the transmitted\nsignal. CSI information is useful in many cases, but it also brings concerns on\nprivacy and security. In this paper, we open sourced a CSI fuzzer to enhance\nthe privacy and security. It is built and embedded into the transmitter of\nopenwifi, which is an open source full-stack WiFi chip design, to prevent\nunauthorized sensing without sacrificing the WiFi link performance. The CSI\nfuzzer imposes an artificial channel response to the signal before it leaves\nthe transmitter, so the CSI extracted at the receiver will indicate the actual\nchannel response combined with the artificial response. Only the authorized\nreceiver, that knows the artificial response, can calculate the actual channel\nresponse and perform the CSI sensing. Another potential application of the CSI\nfuzzer is covert channels. A set of artificial response patterns can be\npredefined between transmitter and receiver, so covert messages can be\ndelivered via selecting a pattern at the transmitter and recognizing it at the\nreceiver.",

However, we identify attacks to break the claimed security. In\nthis paper, we show our results by providing a security analysis on its dBFT\nprotocol. First, we evaluate NEO's source code and formally present the\nprocedures of dBFT via the state machine replication (SMR) model. Next, we\nprovide a theoretical analysis with two example attacks. These attacks break\nthe security of dBFT with no more than $f$ nodes. Then, we provide\nrecommendations on how to fix the system against the identified attacks. The\nsuggested fixes have been accepted by the NEO official team. Finally, we\nfurther discuss the reasons causing such issues, the relationship with current\npermissioned blockchain systems, and the scope of potential influence.",

    "title": "3D to 4D Facial Expressions Generation Guided by Landmarks",
    "abstract": "While deep learning-based 3D face generation has made a progress recently,\nthe problem of dynamic 3D (4D) facial expression synthesis is less\ninvestigated. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to the following\nquestion: given one input 3D neutral face, can we generate dynamic 3D (4D)\nfacial expressions from it? To tackle this problem, we first propose a mesh\nencoder-decoder architecture (Expr-ED) that exploits a set of 3D landmarks to\ngenerate an expressive 3D face from its neutral counterpart. Then, we extend it\nto 4D by modeling the temporal dynamics of facial expressions using a\nmanifold-valued GAN capable of generating a sequence of 3D landmarks from an\nexpression label (Motion3DGAN). The generated landmarks are fed into the mesh\nencoder-decoder, ultimately producing a sequence of 3D expressive faces. By\ndecoupling the two steps, we separately address the non-linearity induced by\nthe mesh deformation and motion dynamics. The experimental results on the CoMA\ndataset show that our mesh encoder-decoder guided by landmarks brings a\nsignificant improvement with respect to other landmark-based 3D fitting\napproaches, and that we can generate high quality dynamic facial expressions.\nThis framework further enables the 3D expression intensity to be continuously\nadapted from low to high intensity. Finally, we show our framework can be\napplied to other tasks, such as 2D-3D facial expression transfer.",

    "abstract": "Recently, considerable literature has grown up around the theme of few-shot\nnamed entity recognition (NER), but little published benchmark data\nspecifically focused on the practical and challenging task. Current approaches\ncollect existing supervised NER datasets and re-organize them to the few-shot\nsetting for empirical study. These strategies conventionally aim to recognize\ncoarse-grained entity types with few examples, while in practice, most unseen\nentity types are fine-grained. In this paper, we present Few-NERD, a\nlarge-scale human-annotated few-shot NER dataset with a hierarchy of 8\ncoarse-grained and 66 fine-grained entity types. Few-NERD consists of 188,238\nsentences from Wikipedia, 4,601,160 words are included and each is annotated as\ncontext or a part of a two-level entity type. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first few-shot NER dataset and the largest human-crafted NER\ndataset. We construct benchmark tasks with different emphases to\ncomprehensively assess the generalization capability of models. Extensive\nempirical results and analysis show that Few-NERD is challenging and the\nproblem requires further research. We make Few-NERD public at\nhttps://ningding97.github.io/fewnerd/.",

    "abstract": "The ability to simultaneously track and reconstruct multiple objects moving\nin the scene is of the utmost importance for robotic tasks such as autonomous\nnavigation and interaction. Virtually all of the previous attempts to map\nmultiple dynamic objects have evolved to store individual objects in separate\nreconstruction volumes and track the relative pose between them. While simple\nand intuitive, such formulation does not scale well with respect to the number\nof objects in the scene and introduces the need for an explicit occlusion\nhandling strategy. In contrast, we propose a map representation that allows\nmaintaining a single volume for the entire scene and all the objects therein.\nTo this end, we introduce a novel multi-object TSDF formulation that can encode\nmultiple object surfaces at any given location in the map. In a multiple\ndynamic object tracking and reconstruction scenario, our representation allows\nmaintaining accurate reconstruction of surfaces even while they become\ntemporarily occluded by other objects moving in their proximity. We evaluate\nthe proposed TSDF++ formulation on a public synthetic dataset and demonstrate\nits ability to preserve reconstructions of occluded surfaces when compared to\nthe standard TSDF map representation.",

    "abstract": "Intrusive uncertainty quantification methods for hyperbolic problems exhibit\nspurious oscillations at shocks, which leads to a significant reduction of the\noverall approximation quality. Furthermore, a challenging task is to preserve\nhyperbolicity of the gPC moment system. An intrusive method which guarantees\nhyperbolicity is the intrusive polynomial moment (IPM) method, which performs\nthe gPC expansion on the entropy variables. The method, while still being\nsubject to oscillations, requires solving a convex optimization problem in\nevery spatial cell and every time step. The aim of this work is to mitigate\noscillations in the IPM solution by applying filters. Filters reduce\noscillations by damping high order gPC coefficients. Naive filtering, however,\nmay lead to unrealizable moments, which means that the IPM optimization problem\ndoes not have a solution and the method breaks down. In this paper, we propose\nand analyze two separate strategies to guarantee the existence of a solution to\nthe IPM problem. First, we propose a filter which maintains realizability by\nbeing constructed from an underlying Fokker-Planck equation. Second, we\nregularize the IPM optimization problem to be able to cope with non-realizable\ngPC coefficients. Consequently, standard filters can be applied to the\nregularized IPM method. We demonstrate numerical results for the two strategies\nby investigating the Euler equations with uncertain shock structures in one-\nand two-dimensional spatial settings. We are able to show a significant\nreduction of spurious oscillations by the proposed filters.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by security needs in unmanned aerial system (UAS) operations, an\nalgorithm for identifying airspace intruders (e.g., birds vs. drones) is\ndeveloped. The algorithm is structured to use sensed intruder velocity data\nfrom Internet-of-Things platforms together with limited knowledge of physical\nmodels. The identification problem is posed as a statistical hypothesis testing\nor detection problem, wherein inertial feedback-controlled objects subject to\nstochastic actuation must be distinguished by speed data. The maximum a\nposteriori probability detector is obtained, and then is simplified to an\nexplicit computation based on two points in the sample autocorrelation of the\ndata. The simplified form allows computationally-friendly implementation of the\nalgorithm, and simplified learning from archived data. Also, the total\nprobability of error of the detector is computed and characterized. Simulations\nbased on synthesized data are presented to illustrate and supplement the formal\nanalyses.",

    "abstract": "Neural network architectures are achieving superhuman performance on an\nexpanding range of tasks. To effectively and safely deploy these systems, their\ndecision-making must be understandable to a wide range of stakeholders. Methods\nto explain AI have been proposed to answer this challenge, but a lack of theory\nimpedes the development of systematic abstractions which are necessary for\ncumulative knowledge gains. We propose Bayesian Teaching as a framework for\nunifying explainable AI (XAI) by integrating machine learning and human\nlearning. Bayesian Teaching formalizes explanation as a communication act of an\nexplainer to shift the beliefs of an explainee. This formalization decomposes\nany XAI method into four components: (1) the inference to be explained, (2) the\nexplanatory medium, (3) the explainee model, and (4) the explainer model. The\nabstraction afforded by Bayesian Teaching to decompose any XAI method\nelucidates the invariances among them. The decomposition of XAI systems enables\nmodular validation, as each of the first three components listed can be tested\nsemi-independently. This decomposition also promotes generalization through\nrecombination of components from different XAI systems, which facilitates the\ngeneration of novel variants. These new variants need not be evaluated one by\none provided that each component has been validated, leading to an exponential\ndecrease in development time. Finally, by making the goal of explanation\nexplicit, Bayesian Teaching helps developers to assess how suitable an XAI\nsystem is for its intended real-world use case. Thus, Bayesian Teaching\nprovides a theoretical framework that encourages systematic, scientific\ninvestigation of XAI.",

    "abstract": "We consider the energy complexity of the leader election problem in the\nsingle-hop radio network model, where each device has a unique identifier in\n$\\{1, 2, \\ldots, N\\}$. Energy is a scarce resource for small battery-powered\ndevices. For such devices, most of the energy is often spent on communication,\nnot on computation. To approximate the actual energy cost, the energy\ncomplexity of an algorithm is defined as the maximum over all devices of the\nnumber of time slots where the device transmits or listens. Much progress has\nbeen made in understanding the energy complexity of leader election in radio\nnetworks, but very little is known about the trade-off between time and energy.\n$\\textbf{Time-energy trade-off:}$ For any $k \\geq \\log \\log N$, we show that\na leader among at most $n$ devices can be elected deterministically in\n$O(n^{1+\\epsilon}) + O(k \\cdot N^{1/k})$ time and $O(k)$ energy if each device\ncan simultaneously transmit and listen, where $\\epsilon > 0$ is any small\nconstant. This improves upon the previous $O(N)$-time $O(\\log \\log N)$-energy\nalgorithm by Chang et al. [STOC 2017].

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a teacher network to a\nstudent by enforcing the student to mimic the outputs of the pretrained teacher\non training data. However, data samples are not always accessible in many cases\ndue to large data sizes, privacy, or confidentiality. Many efforts have been\nmade on addressing this problem for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) whose\ninputs lie in a grid domain within a continuous space such as images and\nvideos, but largely overlook graph neural networks (GNNs) that handle non-grid\ndata with different topology structures within a discrete space. The inherent\ndifferences between their inputs make these CNN-based approaches not applicable\nto GNNs. In this paper, we propose to our best knowledge the first dedicated\napproach to distilling knowledge from a GNN without graph data. The proposed\ngraph-free KD (GFKD) learns graph topology structures for knowledge transfer by\nmodeling them with multinomial distribution. We then introduce a gradient\nestimator to optimize this framework. Essentially, the gradients w.r.t. graph\nstructures are obtained by only using GNN forward-propagation without\nback-propagation, which means that GFKD is compatible with modern GNN libraries\nsuch as DGL and Geometric. Moreover, we provide the strategies for handling\ndifferent types of prior knowledge in the graph data or the GNNs.

    "abstract": "One of the limiting factors in training data-driven, rare-event prediction\nalgorithms is the scarcity of the events of interest resulting in an extreme\nimbalance in the data. There have been many methods introduced in the\nliterature for overcoming this issue; simple data manipulation through\nundersampling and oversampling, utilizing cost-sensitive learning algorithms,\nor by generating synthetic data points following the distribution of the\nexisting data. While synthetic data generation has recently received a great\ndeal of attention, there are real challenges involved in doing so for\nhigh-dimensional data such as multivariate time series. In this study, we\nexplore the usefulness of the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN)\nas a means to perform data-informed oversampling in order to balance a large\ndataset of multivariate time series. We utilize a flare forecasting benchmark\ndataset, named SWAN-SF, and design two verification methods to both\nquantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the similarity between the generated\nminority and the ground-truth samples. We further assess the quality of the\ngenerated samples by training a classical, supervised machine learning\nalgorithm on synthetic data, and testing the trained model on the unseen, real\ndata. The results show that the classifier trained on the data augmented with\nthe synthetic multivariate time series achieves a significant improvement\ncompared with the case where no augmentation is used. The popular flare\nforecasting evaluation metrics, TSS and HSS, report 20-fold and 5-fold\nimprovements, respectively, indicating the remarkable statistical similarities,\nand the usefulness of CGAN-based data generation for complicated tasks such as\nflare forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Due to its powerful capability of representation learning and high-efficiency\ncomputation, deep hashing has made significant progress in large-scale image\nretrieval. However, deep hashing networks are vulnerable to adversarial\nexamples, which is a practical secure problem but seldom studied in\nhashing-based retrieval field. In this paper, we propose a novel\nprototype-supervised adversarial network (ProS-GAN), which formulates a\nflexible generative architecture for efficient and effective targeted hashing\nattack. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generation-based method\nto attack deep hashing networks. Generally, our proposed framework consists of\nthree parts, i.e., a PrototypeNet, a generator, and a discriminator.\nSpecifically, the designed PrototypeNet embeds the target label into the\nsemantic representation and learns the prototype code as the category-level\nrepresentative of the target label. Moreover, the semantic representation and\nthe original image are jointly fed into the generator for a flexible targeted\nattack. Particularly, the prototype code is adopted to supervise the generator\nto construct the targeted adversarial example by minimizing the Hamming\ndistance between the hash code of the adversarial example and the prototype\ncode. Furthermore, the generator is against the discriminator to simultaneously\nencourage the adversarial examples visually realistic and the semantic\nrepresentation informative. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed\nframework can efficiently produce adversarial examples with better targeted\nattack performance and transferability over state-of-the-art targeted attack\nmethods of deep hashing.

However, when learning tasks sequentially,\nthe networks easily forget the knowledge of previous tasks, known as\n\"catastrophic forgetting\". To achieve the consistencies between the old tasks\nand the new task, one effective solution is to modify the gradient for update.\nPrevious methods enforce independent gradient constraints for different tasks,\nwhile we consider these gradients contain complex information, and propose to\nleverage inter-task information by gradient decomposition. In particular, the\ngradient of an old task is decomposed into a part shared by all old tasks and a\npart specific to that task. The gradient for update should be close to the\ngradient of the new task, consistent with the gradients shared by all old\ntasks, and orthogonal to the space spanned by the gradients specific to the old\ntasks. In this way, our approach encourages common knowledge consolidation\nwithout impairing the task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, the optimization is\nperformed for the gradients of each layer separately rather than the\nconcatenation of all gradients as in previous works.

For example, to compute the\nproduct of matrices ${\\bf U, V}$, MatDot codes partition each matrix into $p>1$\nsub-matrices to create smaller coded computation tasks that reduce the\nupload/storage at each server by $1/p$, such that ${\\bf UV}$ can be recovered\nfrom the answers returned by any $R=2p-1$ servers. An important concern in CDMM\nis to reduce the recovery threshold $R$ for a given storage/upload constraint.\nRecently, Jeong et al. introduced Approximate MatDot (AMD) codes that are shown\nto improve the recovery threshold by a factor of nearly $2$, from $2p-1$ to\n$p$. A key observation that motivates our work is that the storage/upload\nrequired for approximate computing depends not only on the dimensions of the\n(coded) sub-matrices that are assigned to each server, but also on their\nprecision levels -- a critical aspect that is not explored by Jeong et al. Our\nmain contribution is a dimensional analysis of AMD codes inspired by the\nGeneralized Degrees of Freedom (GDoF) framework previously developed for\nwireless networks, which indicates that for the same upload/storage, once the\nprecision levels of the task assignments are accounted for, AMD codes\nsurprisingly fall short in all aspects to even the trivial replication scheme\nwhich assigns the full computation task to every server. Indeed, the trivial\nreplication scheme has a much better recovery threshold of $1$, better download\ncost, better computation cost, and much better encoding/decoding (none\nrequired) complexity than AMD codes. The dimensional analysis is supported by\nsimple numerical experiments.",

Our evaluation shows\nthat DeepMerge can predict correct resolutions with high precision ($72$%) and\nmodest recall ($34$%) on the dataset overall, and high recall ($78$%) on merges\ncomprising of upto 3 lines that comprise $24$% of the dataset.",

    "title": "Classifying Argumentative Relations Using Logical Mechanisms and  Argumentation Schemes",
    "abstract": "While argument mining has achieved significant success in classifying\nargumentative relations between statements (support, attack, and neutral), we\nhave a limited computational understanding of logical mechanisms that\nconstitute those relations. Most recent studies rely on black-box models, which\nare not as linguistically insightful as desired. On the other hand, earlier\nstudies use rather simple lexical features, missing logical relations between\nstatements. To overcome these limitations, our work classifies argumentative\nrelations based on four logical and theory-informed mechanisms between two\nstatements, namely (i) factual consistency, (ii) sentiment coherence, (iii)\ncausal relation, and (iv) normative relation. We demonstrate that our\noperationalization of these logical mechanisms classifies argumentative\nrelations without directly training on data labeled with the relations,\nsignificantly better than several unsupervised baselines. We further\ndemonstrate that these mechanisms also improve supervised classifiers through\nrepresentation learning.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs), equipped with numerous sensors such as camera,\nLiDAR, radar, and ultrasonic sensor, are revolutionizing the transportation\nindustry. These sensors are expected to sense reliable information from a\nphysical environment, facilitating the critical decision-making process of the\nAVs. Ultrasonic sensors, which detect obstacles in a short distance, play an\nimportant role in assisted parking and blind spot detection events. However,\ndue to their weak security level, ultrasonic sensors are particularly\nvulnerable to signal injection attacks, when the attackers inject malicious\nacoustic signals to create fake obstacles and intentionally mislead the\nvehicles to make wrong decisions with disastrous aftermath. In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze the attack model of signal injection attacks toward\nmoving vehicles. By considering the potential threats, we propose SoundFence, a\nphysical-layer defense system which leverages the sensors' signal processing\ncapability without requiring any additional equipment. SoundFence verifies the\nbenign measurement results and detects signal injection attacks by analyzing\nsensor readings and the physical-layer signatures of ultrasonic signals. Our\nexperiment with commercial sensors shows that SoundFence detects most (more\nthan 95%) of the abnormal sensor readings with very few false alarms, and it\ncan also accurately distinguish the real echo from injected signals to identify\ninjection attacks.",

    "abstract": "During the initial years of its inception, the Internet was widely used for\ntransferring data packets between users and respective data sources by using IP\naddresses. With the advancements in technology, the Internet has been used to\nshare data within several small and resource-constrained devices connected in\nbillions to create the framework for the so-called Internet of Things (IoT).\nThese systems were known for the presentation of a large quantum of data\nemerging within these devices.

Therefore, it was essential to\ndevelop solutions concerning different network-related problems as a part of\nIoT networking.

Considerable research has been conducted recently into the use of\nMachine Learning (ML) techniques to detect spear-phishing emails. ML-based\nsolutions may suffer from zero-day attacks; unseen attacks unaccounted for in\nthe training data. As new attacks emerge, classifiers trained on older data are\nunable to detect these new varieties of attacks resulting in increasingly\ninaccurate predictions. Spear Phishing detection also faces scalability\nchallenges due to the growth of the required features which is proportional to\nthe number of the senders within a receiver mailbox. This differs from\ntraditional phishing attacks which typically perform only a binary\nclassification between phishing and benign emails. Therefore, we devise a\npossible solution to these problems, named RAIDER: Reinforcement AIded Spear\nPhishing DEtectoR. A reinforcement-learning based feature evaluation system\nthat can automatically find the optimum features for detecting different types\nof attacks. By leveraging a reward and penalty system, RAIDER allows for\nautonomous features selection. RAIDER also keeps the number of features to a\nminimum by selecting only the significant features to represent phishing emails\nand detect spear-phishing attacks. After extensive evaluation of RAIDER over\n11,000 emails and across 3 attack scenarios, our results suggest that using\nreinforcement learning to automatically identify the significant features could\nreduce the dimensions of the required features by 55% in comparison to existing\nML-based systems. It also improves the accuracy of detecting spoofing attacks\nby 4% from 90% to 94%.

The obligatory route setup and maintenance of a\ndevice-to-device stable path in MANETs incur significant data retrieval delay\nand transmission overhead. Such overhead exaggerates the packet loss manifold.\nNamed Data Networking (NDN) can avoid such delays and overhead and\nsignificantly improve the overall network performance. It does so with direct\napplication-controlled named-data retrieval from any node in a network instead\nof reaching a specific IP address with protocol message exchange. However,\nexisting works lack any explicit or systematic analysis to justify such claims.\nOur work analyzes the core NDN and IP architectures in a MANET at a baseline\nlevel. The extensive simulations show that NDN, when applied correctly, yields\nmuch lower data retrieval latency than IP and can lower the network\ntransmission overhead in most cases. As a result, NDN's stateful forwarder can\nsignificantly increase the retrieval rate, offering a better trade-off at the\nnetwork layer.

    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering has been widely adopted by modern recommender systems\nto discover user preferences based on their past behaviors. However, the\nobserved interactions for different users are usually unbalanced, which leads\nto high uncertainty in the collaborative embeddings of users with sparse\nratings, thereby severely degenerating the recommendation performance.\nConsequently, more efforts have been dedicated to the hybrid recommendation\nstrategy where user/item features are utilized as auxiliary information to\naddress the sparsity problem. However, since these features contain rich\nmultimodal patterns and most of them are irrelevant to the recommendation\npurpose, excessive reliance on these features will make the model difficult to\ngeneralize. To address the above two challenges, we propose a VBAE for\nrecommendation. VBAE models both the collaborative and the user feature\nembeddings as Gaussian random variables inferred via deep neural networks to\ncapture non-linear similarities between users based on their ratings and\nfeatures. Furthermore, VBAE establishes an information regulation mechanism by\nintroducing a user-dependent channel variable where the bandwidth is determined\nby the information already contained in the observed ratings to dynamically\ncontrol the amount of information allowed to be accessed from the corresponding\nuser features. The user-dependent channel variable alleviates the uncertainty\nproblem when the ratings are sparse while avoids unnecessary dependence of the\nmodel on noisy user features simultaneously.

    "abstract": "BATS codes are a class of efficient random linear network coding variation\nthat has been studied for multihop wireless networks mostly in scenarios of a\nsingle communication flow. Towards sophisticated multi-flow network\ncommunications, we formulate a network utility maximization (NUM) problem that\njointly optimizes the BATS code parameters of all the flows and network\nscheduling. The NUM problem adopts a batch-wise packet loss model that can be\nobtained from the network local statistics without any constraints on packet\nloss patterns. Moreover, the NUM problem allows a different number of recoded\npackets to be transmitted for different batches in a flow, which is called\nadaptive recoding. Due to both the non-convex objective and the BATS\ncode-related variables, the algorithms developed for the existing flow\noptimization problems can not be directed applied to solve our NUM problem. We\nintroduce a two-step algorithm for solving the NUM problem, where the first\nstep solves the problem with nonadaptive recoding schemes, and the second step\noptimizes adaptive recoding hop-by-hop from upstream to downstream in each\nflow. We perform various numerical evaluations and simulations to verify the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm.",

    "title": "Towards Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Deep Face Recognition under  Privacy Constraints via Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation has been widely adopted to generalize models\nfor unlabeled data in a target domain, given labeled data in a source domain,\nwhose data distributions differ from the target domain. However, existing works\nare inapplicable to face recognition under privacy constraints because they\nrequire sharing sensitive face images between two domains. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel unsupervised federated face recognition approach\n(FedFR). FedFR improves the performance in the target domain by iteratively\naggregating knowledge from the source domain through federated learning. It\nprotects data privacy by transferring models instead of raw data between\ndomains. Besides, we propose a new domain constraint loss (DCL) to regularize\nsource domain training. DCL suppresses the data volume dominance of the source\ndomain. We also enhance a hierarchical clustering algorithm to predict pseudo\nlabels for the unlabeled target domain accurately. To this end, FedFR forms an\nend-to-end training pipeline: (1) pre-train in the source domain; (2) predict\npseudo labels by clustering in the target domain; (3) conduct\ndomain-constrained federated learning across two domains. Extensive experiments\nand analysis on two newly constructed benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness\nof FedFR. It outperforms the baseline and classic methods in the target domain\nby over 4% on the more realistic benchmark. We believe that FedFR will shed\nlight on applying federated learning to more computer vision tasks under\nprivacy constraints.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we present the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm\nfor determining the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle and finding a Hamiltonian\ncycle in general graphs. Our algorithm can also resolve the Hamiltonian path\nproblem in the traceable graphs. The space complexity of our algorithm is\nO(n^4). The time complexity are theoretically O(n^5*d^2) on average and\nO(n^6*d^2) in the worst case respectively, where d is the maximum degree of\nvertex. With parallel computing, the space complexity can be improved to O(n^3)\nand the time complexity to O(n^3*d^2) on average and O(n^4*d^2) in the worst\ncase. We construct the corresponding path hologram transformed from the\noriginal graph and compute the path set, which is a collection of segment sets\nconsisting of all the vertices located on the same segment layer among all the\nlongest basic paths, of every vertex with dynamic programming. The path\nhologram is a multi-segment graph with the vertex <u, k> where u is a vertex\nand k is the segment layer of u in the path hologram. To ensure each path\nstored in the path set is legal and each segment set of the path set contains\nonly valid vertices, the key strategy of our method is the \"consecutive\"\ndeleting-replenishing operations recursively on the left/right action field of\na vertex, respectively. The greatest contribution of our method is the path set\nin which the (n-1)! paths can be stored in O(n^2) space for a complete graph of\norder n. In fact, our algorithm can be directly applied to the original graph.\nBesides, our algorithm can deal with the finite general graphs including\nundirected, directed, and mixed. As a well-known problem in NPC, the\nHamiltonian Cycle Problem can be now resolved practically in deterministic\npolynomial time, so this problem is in P and we prove that the conjecture of\nP=NP holds.",

As a multimachine extension of an existing result on a\nsingle-machine-infinite-bus (SMIB) system, we show that the total damping power\nfor a mode stemming from the interaction of electromagnetic torques and rotor\nspeeds is equal to the sum of average power dissipations in the generator\nwindings corresponding to the modal oscillation. Further, counter-intuitive to\nthe SMIB result, we demonstrate that, although the equality holds on an\naggregate, such is not the case for individual machines in an interconnected\nsystem. To that end, distribution factors are derived for expressing the\naverage damping power of each generator as a linear combination of average\npowers of modal energy dissipation in the windings of all machines in the\nsystem. These factors represent the distribution of damping power in a\nmultimachine system. The results are validated on IEEE 4-machine and 16-machine\ntest systems.",

While a lot of\ndifferent methods for computing counterfactual explanations exist, only very\nfew work (apart from work from the causality domain) considers feature\ndependencies as well as plausibility which might limit the set of possible\ncounterfactual explanations.\nIn this work we enhance our previous work on convex modeling for computing\ncounterfactual explanations by a mechanism for ensuring actionability and\nplausibility of the resulting counterfactual explanations.",

    "abstract": "An understanding and classification of driving scenarios are important for\ntesting and development of autonomous driving functionalities. Machine learning\nmodels are useful for scenario classification but most of them assume that data\nreceived during the testing are from one of the classes used in the training.\nThis assumption is not true always because of the open environment where\nvehicles operate. This is addressed by a new machine learning paradigm called\nopen-set recognition. Open-set recognition is the problem of assigning test\nsamples to one of the classes used in training or to an unknown class. This\nwork proposes a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Random\nForest (RF) for open set recognition of traffic scenarios. CNNs are used for\nthe feature generation and the RF algorithm along with extreme value theory for\nthe detection of known and unknown classes. The proposed solution is featured\nby exploring the vote patterns of trees in RF instead of just majority voting.\nBy inheriting the ensemble nature of RF, the vote pattern of all trees combined\nwith extreme value theory is shown to be well suited for detecting unknown\nclasses. The proposed method has been tested on the highD and OpenTraffic\ndatasets and has demonstrated superior performance in various aspects compared\nto existing solutions.",

The RFAP similarity is generated\nusing a tree encoding scheme in a Random Forest algorithm.

Second,\nthe CNN is fine-tuned for classification of the labelled scenarios. Third,\nusing the labelled and unlabelled scenarios an iterative optimisation procedure\nis performed for clustering. In the third step at each epoch of the iterative\noptimisation, the CNN is used as a feature generator for an unsupervised Random\nForest.

Conventional methods for 3D object detection need vast amounts of\nmanually labelled 3D data as supervision signals.

To tackle this\nproblem, we propose frustum-aware geometric reasoning (FGR) to detect vehicles\nin point clouds without any 3D annotations.

For the first stage, a\ncontext-aware adaptive region growing algorithm is designed to segment objects\nbased on 2D bounding boxes. Leveraging predicted segmentation masks, we develop\nan anti-noise approach to estimate 3D bounding boxes in the second stage.\nFinally 3D pseudo labels generated by our method are utilized to train a 3D\ndetector. Independent of any 3D groundtruth, FGR reaches comparable performance\nwith fully supervised methods on the KITTI dataset. The findings indicate that\nit is able to accurately detect objects in 3D space with only 2D bounding boxes\nand sparse point clouds.",

    "abstract": "Self-organization is a process where a stable pattern is formed by the\ncooperative behavior between parts of an initially disordered system without\nexternal control or influence. It has been introduced to multi-agent systems as\nan internal control process or mechanism to solve difficult problems\nspontaneously. However, because a self-organizing multi-agent system has\nautonomous agents and local interactions between them, it is difficult to\npredict the behavior of the system from the behavior of the local agents we\ndesign. This paper proposes a logic-based framework of self-organizing\nmulti-agent systems, where agents interact with each other by following their\nprescribed local rules. The dependence relation between coalitions of agents\nregarding their contributions to the global behavior of the system is reasoned\nabout from the structural and semantic perspectives. We show that the\ncomputational complexity of verifying such a self-organizing multi-agent system\nremains close to the domain of standard ATL. We then combine our framework with\ngraph theory to decompose a system into different coalitions located in\ndifferent layers, which allows us to verify agents' full contributions more\nefficiently. The resulting information about agents' full contributions allows\nus to understand the complex link between local agent behavior and system level\nbehavior in a self-organizing multi-agent system.

The results of the investigation prove high efficiency\nof the proposed policies.

    "abstract": "Higher-order methods for dependency parsing can partially but not fully\naddresses the issue that edges in dependency tree should be constructed at the\ntext span/subtree level rather than word level. % This shortcoming can cause an\nincorrect span covered the corresponding tree rooted at a certain word though\nthe word is correctly linked to its head. In this paper, we propose a new\nmethod for dependency parsing to address this issue. The proposed method\nconstructs dependency trees by directly modeling span-span (in other words,\nsubtree-subtree) relations. It consists of two modules: the {\\it text span\nproposal module} which proposes candidate text spans, each of which represents\na subtree in the dependency tree denoted by (root, start, end); and the {\\it\nspan linking module}, which constructs links between proposed spans. We use the\nmachine reading comprehension (MRC) framework as the backbone to formalize the\nspan linking module in an MRC setup, where one span is used as a query to\nextract the text span/subtree it should be linked to. The proposed method comes\nwith the following merits: (1) it addresses the fundamental problem that edges\nin a dependency tree should be constructed between subtrees; (2) the MRC\nframework allows the method to retrieve missing spans in the span proposal\nstage, which leads to higher recall for eligible spans. Extensive experiments\non the PTB, CTB and Universal Dependencies (UD) benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.

Multimodal learning,\nespecially for audiovisual learning, has drawn considerable attention recently,\nwhich can boost the performance of various computer vision tasks. However, in\nvideo summarization, existing approaches just exploit the visual information\nwhile neglect the audio information. In this paper, we argue that the audio\nmodality can assist vision modality to better understand the video content and\nstructure, and further benefit the summarization process. Motivated by this, we\npropose to jointly exploit the audio and visual information for the video\nsummarization task, and develop an AudioVisual Recurrent Network (AVRN) to\nachieve this. Specifically, the proposed AVRN can be separated into three\nparts: 1) the two-stream LSTM is utilized to encode the audio and visual\nfeature sequentially by capturing their temporal dependency. 2) the audiovisual\nfusion LSTM is employed to fuse the two modalities by exploring the latent\nconsistency between them. 3) the self-attention video encoder is adopted to\ncapture the global dependency in the video. Finally, the fused audiovisual\ninformation, and the integrated temporal and global dependencies are jointly\nused to predict the video summary. Practically, the experimental results on the\ntwo benchmarks, \\emph{i.e.,} SumMe and TVsum, have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of each part, and the superiority of AVRN compared to those\napproaches just exploiting visual information for video summarization.",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic models such as Gaussian processes (GPs) are powerful tools to\nlearn unknown dynamical systems from data for subsequent use in control design.\nWhile learning-based control has the potential to yield superior performance in\ndemanding applications, robustness to uncertainty remains an important\nchallenge. Since Bayesian methods quantify uncertainty of the learning results,\nit is natural to incorporate these uncertainties into a robust design. In\ncontrast to most state-of-the-art approaches that consider worst-case\nestimates, we leverage the learning method's posterior distribution in the\ncontroller synthesis. The result is a more informed and, thus, more efficient\ntrade-off between performance and robustness. We present a novel controller\nsynthesis for linearized GP dynamics that yields robust controllers with\nrespect to a probabilistic stability margin. The formulation is based on a\nrecently proposed algorithm for linear quadratic control synthesis, which we\nextend by giving probabilistic robustness guarantees in the form of credibility\nbounds for the system's stability.Comparisons to existing methods based on\nworst-case and certainty-equivalence designs reveal superior performance and\nrobustness properties of the proposed method.",

In this paper, we consider line networks formed\nby discrete memoryless channels, and study the achievable rate of batched\ncodes, which include several existing coding schemes studied in literature for\nline networks as special cases. A batched code has an outer code and an inner\ncode. The outer code encodes the information messages into batches, each of\nwhich is a group of coded symbols, while the inner code performs recoding on\nthe symbols belonging to the same batch at all nodes that forwarding a batch.\nBatched codes enable us to impose various block-length and buffer size\nconstraints by tuning coding parameters. Using a technique that captures the\ncommunication bottleneck of line networks, we derive upper bounds on the\nachievable rates of batched codes as functions of line network length for\nseveral coding parameter sets. We also discuss specific recoding schemes that\ncan achieve rates of the same order of the line network length for these coding\nparameter sets. Our results shed light on how to design large multi-hop network\ncommunications in practical scenarios using a unified coding framework instead\nof the traditional layered approach.",

The proposed method enforces\nvoxel-wise feature relations in the representation space for leveraging limited\ndatasets more comprehensively to achieve better performance. Inspired by recent\nprogress in contrastive learning, we suppressed voxel-wise relations from the\nsame class to be projected to the same point without using negative samples.\nMoreover, we introduce a multi-resolution context aggregation method that\naggregates features from multiple hidden layers, which encodes both the global\nand local contexts for segmentation.

    "abstract": "Video frame interpolation can up-convert the frame rate and enhance the video\nquality. In recent years, although the interpolation performance has achieved\ngreat success, image blur usually occurs at the object boundaries owing to the\nlarge motion. It has been a long-standing problem, and has not been addressed\nyet. In this paper, we propose to reduce the image blur and get the clear shape\nof objects by preserving the edges in the interpolated frames. To this end, the\nproposed Edge-Aware Network (EA-Net) integrates the edge information into the\nframe interpolation task. It follows an end-to-end architecture and can be\nseparated into two stages, \\emph{i.e.}, edge-guided flow estimation and\nedge-protected frame synthesis. Specifically, in the flow estimation stage,\nthree edge-aware mechanisms are developed to emphasize the frame edges in\nestimating flow maps, so that the edge-maps are taken as the auxiliary\ninformation to provide more guidance to boost the flow accuracy. In the frame\nsynthesis stage, the flow refinement module is designed to refine the flow map,\nand the attention module is carried out to adaptively focus on the\nbidirectional flow maps when synthesizing the intermediate frames. Furthermore,\nthe frame and edge discriminators are adopted to conduct the adversarial\ntraining strategy, so as to enhance the reality and clarity of synthesized\nframes. Experiments on three benchmarks, including Vimeo90k, UCF101 for\nsingle-frame interpolation and Adobe240-fps for multi-frame interpolation, have\ndemonstrated the superiority of the proposed EA-Net for the video frame\ninterpolation task.",

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal Magnetic Resonance\n(MR) images is essential in brain tumor diagnosis and treatment. However, due\nto the existence of domain shifts among different modalities, the performance\nof networks decreases dramatically when training on one modality and performing\non another, e.g., train on T1 image while performing on T2 image, which is\noften required in clinical applications. This also prohibits a network from\nbeing trained on labeled data and then transferred to unlabeled data from a\ndifferent domain. To overcome this, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)\nmethods provide effective solutions to alleviate the domain shift between\nlabeled source data and unlabeled target data. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Bidirectional Global-to-Local (BiGL) adaptation framework under a UDA\nscheme. Specifically, a bidirectional image synthesis and segmentation module\nis proposed to segment the brain tumor using the intermediate data\ndistributions generated for the two domains, which includes an image-to-image\ntranslator and a shared-weighted segmentation network. Further, a\nglobal-to-local consistency learning module is proposed to build robust\nrepresentation alignments in an integrated way. Extensive experiments on a\nmulti-modal brain MR benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed method\noutperforms several state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods by\na large margin, while a comprehensive ablation study validates the\neffectiveness of each key component.

    "abstract": "Kolmogorov's representation theorem provides a framework for decomposing any\narbitrary real-valued, multivariate, and continuous function into a two-layer\nnested superposition of a finite number of functions. The functions at these\ntwo layers, are referred to as the inner and outer functions with the key\nproperty that the design of the inner functions is independent of that of the\noriginal function of interest to be computed. This brings modularity and\nuniversality to the design of the inner function, and subsequently, a part of\ncomputation. This paper capitalizes on such modularity and universality in\nfunctional representation to propose two frameworks for distributed computation\nover the additive multiple access channels (MACs). In the first framework, each\nsource encodes the inner representations and sends them over the additive MAC.\nSubsequently, the receiver computes the outer functions to compute the function\nof interest. Transmitting the values of the inner functions instead of the\nmessages directly leads to compression gains. In the second approach, in order\nto further increase the compression rate, the framework aims to also bring\ncomputing the outer functions to the source sites. Specifically, each source\nemploys a graph-coloring-based approach to perform joint functional compression\nof the inner and the outer functions, which may attain further compression\nsavings over the former. These modular encoding schemes provide an exact\nrepresentation in the asymptotic regime and the non-asymptotic regime.\nContrasting these with the baseline model where sources directly transmit data\nover MAC, we observe gains. To showcase the gains of these two frameworks and\ntheir discrepancies, they are applied to a number of commonly used computations\nin distributed systems, e.g., computing products, $\\ell_m$-norms, polynomial\nfunctions, extremum values of functions, and affine transformations.",

Then the GAN learns the evolution of the low-dimensional\nstates over time. The results show that the proposed methods can accurately\npredict the evolution of the high-fidelity numerical simulation, and can\nefficiently assimilate observed data and determine the corresponding model\nparameters.",

    "title": "Toward the Design of Fault-Tolerance- and Peak- Power-Aware Multi-Core  Mixed-Criticality Systems",
    "abstract": "Mixed-Criticality (MC) systems have recently been devised to address the\nrequirements of real-time systems in industrial applications, where the system\nruns tasks with different criticality levels on a single platform. In some\nworkloads, a high-critically task might overrun and overload the system, or a\nfault can occur during the execution. However, these systems must be\nfault-tolerant and guarantee the correct execution of all high-criticality\ntasks by their deadlines to avoid catastrophic consequences, in any situation.\nFurthermore, in these MC systems, the peak power consumption of the system may\nincrease, especially in an overload situation and exceed the processor Thermal\nDesign Power (TDP) constraint. This may cause generating heat beyond the\ncooling capacity, resulting the system stop to avoid excessive heat and halting\nthe processor. In this paper, we propose a technique for dependent\ndual-criticality tasks in fault-tolerant multi-core MC systems to manage peak\npower consumption and temperature. The technique develops a tree of possible\ntask mapping and scheduling at design-time to cover all possible scenarios and\nreduce the low-criticality task drop rate in the high-criticality mode. At\nrun-time, the system exploits the tree to select a proper schedule according to\nfault occurrences and criticality mode changes. Experimental results show that\nthe average task schedulability is 74.14% on average for the proposed method,\nwhile the peak power consumption and maximum temperature are improved by 16.65%\nand 14.9 C on average, respectively, compared to a recent work. In addition,\nfor a real-life application, our method reduces the peak power and maximum\ntemperature by up to 20.06% and 5 C, respectively, compared to a\nstate-of-the-art approach.",

We prove that both these\nproblems can be avoided by choosing an activation function possessing a\nsufficiently large linear region around the origin, relative to the bias\nvariance $\\sigma_b^2$ of the network's random initialisation. We demonstrate\nempirically that using such activation functions leads to tangible benefits in\npractice, both in terms test and training accuracy as well as training time.\nFurthermore, we observe that the shape of the nonlinear activation outside the\nlinear region appears to have a relatively limited impact on training.

We find that any model built using the proposed framework is\ndense in the space $C(\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{P}_1(\\mathcal{Y}))$ of continuous\nfunctions from $\\mathcal{X}$ to $\\mathcal{P}_1(\\mathcal{Y})$ in the\ncorresponding uniform convergence on compacts topology, quantitatively. We\nidentify two methods in which the curse of dimensionality can be broken. The\nfirst approach constructs subsets of\n$C(\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{P}_1(\\mathcal{Y}))$ consisting of functions that can be\nefficiently approximated. In the second approach, given any fixed $f \\in\nC(\\mathcal{X},\\mathcal{P}_1(\\mathcal{Y}))$, we build non-trivial subsets of\n$\\mathcal{X}$ on which $f$ can be efficiently approximated. The results are\napplied to three open problems lying at the interface of applied probability\nand computational learning theory. We find that the proposed models can\napproximate any regular conditional distribution of a $\\mathcal{Y}$-valued\nrandom element $Y$ depending on an $\\mathcal{X}$-valued random element $X$,\nwith arbitrarily high probability. The proposed models are also shown to be\ncapable of generically expressing the aleatoric uncertainty present in most\nrandomized machine learning models. The proposed framework is used to derive an\naffirmative answer to the open conjecture of Bishop (1994); namely: mixture\ndensity networks are generic regular conditional distributions.

To achieve the desired periodic\nmotion, we propose to adjust the dynamic response of the mechanism by selecting\nits mass distribution and the characteristic of a nonlinear spring. In\nparticular, we introduce a two-step optimization strategy to shape the system's\nzero dynamics, obtained via input-output linearization. The first part of the\nprocedure aims to minimize the root-mean-square value of the input torque by\noptimizing the mechanism's mass distribution. In this context, we show that a\nperfect matching with the desired trajectory can be reached by assuming the\nability to design an arbitrary shape of the system's elastic properties. Then,\nin order to favor a simpler physical implementation of the structure, we\ndedicate the second optimization step to the piecewise linear approximation of\nthe previously defined stiffness characteristic. The proposed procedure is\nfinally tested in detailed numerical simulations, confirming its effectiveness\nin generating a complex and efficient periodic motion.",

To address the issue, we propose to introduce the\nmotion consistency to force the smoothness among neighboring points.

To this end, a high-order CRFs based relation module (Con-HCRFs)\nis deployed to explore both point-wise smoothness and region-wise rigidity. To\nempower the CRFs to have a discriminative unary term, we also introduce a\nposition-aware flow estimation module to be incorporated into the Con-HCRFs.\nComprehensive experiments on FlyingThings3D and KITTI show that our proposed\nframework (HCRF-Flow) achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly\noutperforms previous approaches substantially.",

    "abstract": "One of the biggest problems in itemset mining is the requirement of\ndeveloping a data structure or algorithm, every time a user wants to extract a\ndifferent type of itemsets. To overcome this, we propose a method, called\nGeneric Itemset Mining based on Reinforcement Learning (GIM-RL), that offers a\nunified framework to train an agent for extracting any type of itemsets. In\nGIM-RL, the environment formulates iterative steps of extracting a target type\nof itemsets from a dataset. At each step, an agent performs an action to add or\nremove an item to or from the current itemset, and then obtains from the\nenvironment a reward that represents how relevant the itemset resulting from\nthe action is to the target type. Through numerous trial-and-error steps where\nvarious rewards are obtained by diverse actions, the agent is trained to\nmaximise cumulative rewards so that it acquires the optimal action policy for\nforming as many itemsets of the target type as possible. In this framework, an\nagent for extracting any type of itemsets can be trained as long as a reward\nsuitable for the type can be defined. The extensive experiments on mining high\nutility itemsets, frequent itemsets and association rules show the general\neffectiveness and one remarkable potential (agent transfer) of GIM-RL.

It works by mixing multiple private images\nand modifying them in such a way that their visual features are no longer\ndistinguishable to the naked eye, without significantly degrading the accuracy\nof training. In recent work, however, Carlini et al. show that it is possible\nto reconstruct private images from the encrypted dataset generated by\nInstaHide, by exploiting the correlations among the encrypted images.\nNevertheless, Carlini et al.'s attack relies on the assumption that each\nprivate image is used without modification when mixing up with other private\nimages. As a consequence, it could be easily defeated by incorporating data\naugmentation into InstaHide. This leads to a natural question: is InstaHide\nwith data augmentation secure?\nThis paper provides a negative answer to the above question, by present an\nattack for recovering private images from the outputs of InstaHide even when\ndata augmentation is present. The basic idea of our attack is to use a\ncomparative network to identify encrypted images that are likely to correspond\nto the same private image, and then employ a fusion-denoising network for\nrestoring the private image from the encrypted ones, taking into account the\neffects of data augmentation.

    "abstract": "In recommendation systems, the existence of the missing-not-at-random (MNAR)\nproblem results in the selection bias issue, degrading the recommendation\nperformance ultimately. A common practice to address MNAR is to treat missing\nentries from the so-called ``exposure'' perspective, i.e., modeling how an item\nis exposed (provided) to a user. Most of the existing approaches use heuristic\nmodels or re-weighting strategy on observed ratings to mimic the\nmissing-at-random setting. However, little research has been done to reveal how\nthe ratings are missing from a causal perspective. To bridge the gap, we\npropose an unbiased and robust method called DENC (De-bias Network Confounding\nin Recommendation) inspired by confounder analysis in causal inference. In\ngeneral, DENC provides a causal analysis on MNAR from both the inherent factors\n(e.g., latent user or item factors) and auxiliary network's perspective.\nParticularly, the proposed exposure model in DENC can control the social\nnetwork confounder meanwhile preserves the observed exposure information. We\nalso develop a deconfounding model through the balanced representation learning\nto retain the primary user and item features, which enables DENC generalize\nwell on the rating prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets validate\nthat our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "The way developers implement their algorithms and how these implementations\nbehave on modern CPUs are governed by the design and organization of these. The\nvectorization units (SIMD) are among the few CPUs' parts that can and must be\nexplicitly controlled. In the HPC community, the x86 CPUs and their\nvectorization instruction sets were de-facto the standard for decades. Each new\nrelease of an instruction set was usually a doubling of the vector length\ncoupled with new operations. Each generation was pushing for adapting and\nimproving previous implementations. The release of the ARM scalable vector\nextension (SVE) changed things radically for several reasons. First, we expect\nARM processors to equip many supercomputers in the next years. Second, SVE's\ninterface is different in several aspects from the x86 extensions as it\nprovides different instructions, uses a predicate to control most operations,\nand has a vector size that is only known at execution time. Therefore, using\nSVE opens new challenges on how to adapt algorithms including the ones that are\nalready well-optimized on x86. In this paper, we port a hybrid sort based on\nthe well-known Quicksort and Bitonic-sort algorithms. We use a Bitonic sort to\nprocess small partitions/arrays and a vectorized partitioning implementation to\ndivide the partitions. We explain how we use the predicates and how we manage\nthe non-static vector size. We explain how we efficiently implement the sorting\nkernels. Our approach only needs an array of O(log N) for the recursive calls\nin the partitioning phase, both in the sequential and in the parallel case. We\ntest the performance of our approach on a modern ARMv8.2 and assess the\ndifferent layers of our implementation by sorting/partitioning integers, double\nfloating-point numbers, and key/value pairs of integers. Our approach is faster\nthan the GNU C++ sort algorithm by a speedup factor of 4 on average.",

Psychedelic\ndrugs (YDs) have proven particularly effective in this respect, producing\nsubjective phenomenology which reliably elicits intense STEs. With virtual\nreality (VR) emerging as a powerful tool for constructing new perceptual\nenvironments, we describe a VR framework called 'Isness-distributed' (Isness-D)\nwhich harnesses the unique affordances of distributed multi-person VR to blur\nconventional self-other boundaries. Within Isness-D, groups of participants\nco-habit a shared virtual space, collectively experiencing their bodies as\nluminous energetic essences with diffuse spatial boundaries. It enables moments\nof 'energetic coalescence', a new class of embodied phenomenological\nintersubjective experience where bodies can fluidly merge, enabling\nparticipants to have an experience of including multiple others within their\nself-representation. To evaluate Isness-D, we adopted a citizen science\napproach, coordinating an international network of Isness-D 'nodes'. We\nanalyzed the results (N = 58) using 4 different self-report scales previously\napplied to analyze subjective YD phenomenology (the inclusion of community in\nself scale, ego-dissolution inventory, communitas scale, and the MEQ30 mystical\nexperience questionnaire). Despite the complexities associated with a\ndistributed experiment like this, the Isness-D scores on all 4 scales were\nstatistically indistinguishable from recently published YD studies,\ndemonstrating that distributed VR can be used to design intersubjective STEs\nwhere people dissolve their sense of self in the connection to others.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Szufa et al. [AAMAS 2020] presented a \"map of elections\" that\nvisualizes a set of 800 elections generated from various statistical cultures.\nWhile similar elections are grouped together on this map, there is no obvious\ninterpretation of the elections' positions. We provide such an interpretation\nby introducing four canonical \"extreme\" elections, acting as a compass on the\nmap. We use them to analyze both a dataset provided by Szufa et al. and a\nnumber of real-life elections. In effect, we find a new variant of the Mallows\nmodel and show that it captures real-life scenarios particularly well.",

We compute four distance metrics, Single\nLinkage, Complete Linkage, Average Linkage and distance between the centroid.\nWe compare the results of LDA topics and random topics.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in using\ngradient compression to reduce the communication overhead of the distributed\ntraining. However, there is little understanding of applying gradient\ncompression to adaptive gradient methods. Moreover, its performance benefits\nare often limited by the non-negligible compression overhead. In this paper, we\nfirst introduce a novel adaptive gradient method with gradient compression. We\nshow that the proposed method has a convergence rate of\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ for non-convex problems. In addition, we develop a\nscalable system called BytePS-Compress for two-way compression, where the\ngradients are compressed in both directions between workers and parameter\nservers. BytePS-Compress pipelines the compression and decompression on CPUs\nand achieves a high degree of parallelism. Empirical evaluations show that we\nimprove the training time of ResNet50, VGG16, and BERT-base by 5.0%, 58.1%,\n23.3%, respectively, without any accuracy loss with 25 Gb/s networking.\nFurthermore, for training the BERT models, we achieve a compression rate of\n333x compared to the mixed-precision training.",

    "abstract": "We present an approach for encoding visual task relationships to improve\nmodel performance in an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) setting. Semantic\nsegmentation and monocular depth estimation are shown to be complementary\ntasks; in a multi-task learning setting, a proper encoding of their\nrelationships can further improve performance on both tasks. Motivated by this\nobservation, we propose a novel Cross-Task Relation Layer (CTRL), which encodes\ntask dependencies between the semantic and depth predictions. To capture the\ncross-task relationships, we propose a neural network architecture that\ncontains task-specific and cross-task refinement heads. Furthermore, we propose\nan Iterative Self-Learning (ISL) training scheme, which exploits semantic\npseudo-labels to provide extra supervision on the target domain. We\nexperimentally observe improvements in both tasks' performance because the\ncomplementary information present in these tasks is better captured.\nSpecifically, we show that: (1) our approach improves performance on all tasks\nwhen they are complementary and mutually dependent; (2) the CTRL helps to\nimprove both semantic segmentation and depth estimation tasks performance in\nthe challenging UDA setting; (3) the proposed ISL training scheme further\nimproves the semantic segmentation performance.

    "abstract": "Interpretability of intelligent algorithms represented by deep learning has\nbeen yet an open problem. We discuss the shortcomings of the existing\nexplainable method based on the two attributes of explanation, which are called\ncompleteness and explicitness. Furthermore, we point out that a model that\ncompletely relies on feed-forward mapping is extremely easy to cause\ninexplicability because it is hard to quantify the relationship between this\nmapping and the final model. Based on the perspective of the data space\ndivision, the principle of complete local interpretable model-agnostic\nexplanations (CLIMEP) is proposed in this paper. To study the classification\nproblems, we further discussed the equivalence of the CLIMEP and the decision\nboundary. As a matter of fact, it is also difficult to implementation of\nCLIMEP. To tackle the challenge, motivated by the fact that a fully-connected\nneural network (FCNN) with piece-wise linear activation functions (PWLs) can\npartition the input space into several linear regions, we extend this result to\narbitrary FCNNs by the strategy of linearizing the activation functions.\nApplying this technique to solving classification problems, it is the first\ntime that the complete decision boundary of FCNNs has been able to be obtained.\nFinally, we propose the DecisionNet (DNet), which divides the input space by\nthe hyper-planes of the decision boundary. Hence, each linear interval of the\nDNet merely contains samples of the same label.

    "abstract": "Among the most damaging characteristics of the covid-19 pandemic has been its\ndisproportionate effect on disadvantaged communities. As the outbreak has\nspread globally, factors such as systemic racism, marginalisation, and\nstructural inequality have created path dependencies that have led to poor\nhealth outcomes. These social determinants of infectious disease and\nvulnerability to disaster have converged to affect already disadvantaged\ncommunities with higher levels of economic instability, disease exposure,\ninfection severity, and death. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are an\nimportant part of the health informatics toolkit used to fight contagious\ndisease. AI is well known, however, to be susceptible to algorithmic biases\nthat can entrench and augment existing inequality. Uncritically deploying AI in\nthe fight against covid-19 thus risks amplifying the pandemic's adverse effects\non vulnerable groups, exacerbating health inequity. In this paper, we claim\nthat AI systems can introduce or reflect bias and discrimination in three ways:\nin patterns of health discrimination that become entrenched in datasets, in\ndata representativeness, and in human choices made during the design,\ndevelopment, and deployment of these systems. We highlight how the use of AI\ntechnologies threaten to exacerbate the disparate effect of covid-19 on\nmarginalised, under-represented, and vulnerable groups, particularly black,\nAsian, and other minoritised ethnic people, older populations, and those of\nlower socioeconomic status. We conclude that, to mitigate the compounding\neffects of AI on inequalities associated with covid-19, decision makers,\ntechnology developers, and health officials must account for the potential\nbiases and inequities at all stages of the AI process.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have achieved human-scale\nspeed and accuracy for classification tasks. In turn, these capabilities have\nmade AI a viable replacement for many human activities that at their core\ninvolve classification, such as basic mechanical and analytical tasks in\nlow-level service jobs. Current systems do not need to be conscious to\nrecognize patterns and classify them. However, for AI to progress to more\ncomplicated tasks requiring intuition and empathy, it must develop capabilities\nsuch as metathinking, creativity, and empathy akin to human self-awareness or\nconsciousness. We contend that such a paradigm shift is possible only through a\nfundamental shift in the state of artificial intelligence toward consciousness,\na shift similar to what took place for humans through the process of natural\nselection and evolution. As such, this paper aims to theoretically explore the\nrequirements for the emergence of consciousness in AI.

    "abstract": "Most of existing gradient-based meta-learning approaches to few-shot learning\nassume that all tasks have the same input feature space. However, in the real\nworld scenarios, there are many cases that the input structures of tasks can be\ndifferent, that is, different tasks may vary in the number of input modalities\nor the data structure of each modality. Existing gradient-based approaches\ncannot handle such heterogeneous task distribution (HTD) as different types of\ntasks only share partial meta-parameters. In this paper, we propose HetMAML, a\ntask-heterogeneous meta-agnostic meta-learning framework that can generalize\nnot only common meta-parameters shared across different types of tasks but also\ntype-specific meta-parameters. Specifically, we design a multi-channel backbone\nmodule that encodes the input of each type of tasks into the same length\nsequence of modality-specific embeddings. Then, we propose a task-aware\nmultimodal encoder which can automatically take into account the context of\ntask-specific input structures and adaptively project the heterogeneous input\nspaces to the same lower-dimensional concept space. The extensive experiments\non five task-heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our HetMAML successfully\ncaptures both type-specific and shared meta-parameters across heterogeneous\ntasks which fast adapt to all types of new tasks.",

    "abstract": "Unlike conventional mechanisms, compliant mechanisms produce the desired\ndeformations by exploiting elastic strain and do not need, therefore, moving\nparts. The number of degrees of freedom of a conventional mechanism, also\ncalled mobility, is the number of independent coordinates needed to define a\nconfiguration of the mechanism. Due to the different operating principle, such\ndefinition of degree of freedom or mobility cannot be directly applied to\ncompliant mechanisms. While those terms are not able to denote a property of a\ngiven compliant mechanism, they are meaningful when applied to the design of a\ncompliant mechanism. Compliant mechanisms are, however, mostly seen as elastic\nstructures, for which the term degree of freedom is used in a different\nmeaning. In order to avoid ambiguities, the term pseudo-mobility (already\nintroduced in previous published work) will be used to denote the number of\nscalar parameters needed to identify one single desired deformation, i.e. one\nsingle deformation for which the compliant mechanism is designed. Many\nsynthesis approaches exist for compliant mechanisms with single pseudo-mobility\n(commonly referred to as \"single degree of freedom mechanisms\"). In the case of\ncompliant mechanisms with multiple pseudo-mobility (multiple-degree of freedom\nmechanisms), only synthesis approaches for relatively simple mechanisms exist\nso far, while systems for more complex tasks like shape adaptation are not\ncovered. In addition, only certain cases of transverse loads are included in\nthe synthesis with these approaches. In this paper, a novel optimization\nalgorithm is presented that addresses these two shortcomings. The algorithm is\ntested on a simple mechanism with one translation and one rotation kinematic\ndegree of freedom, a compliant parallel mechanism for pure translation and a\nshape-adaptive structure.",

Current network architectures\nshare some of the limitations of classical numerical discretization schemes\nwhen applied to non-linear differential equations in continuum mechanics. A\nparadigmatic example is the solution of hyperbolic conservation laws that\ndevelop highly localized nonlinear shock waves. Learning solutions of PDEs with\ndominant hyperbolic character is a challenge for current PINN approaches, which\nrely, like most grid-based numerical schemes, on adding artificial dissipation.\nHere, we address the fundamental question of which network architectures are\nbest suited to learn the complex behavior of non-linear PDEs.

Our new\nmethodology, called Physics-Informed Attention-based Neural Networks, (PIANNs),\nis a combination of recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms. The\nattention mechanism adapts the behavior of the deep neural network to the\nnon-linear features of the solution, and break the current limitations of\nPINNs.

Power-to-X facilities such as\nelectrolysers and electric boilers can offer extra flexibility to the\nintegrated energy system. In this regard, we aim to jointly determine the\noptimal Power-to-X facility sizing and integrated energy system operations in\nthis study. To account for wind power uncertainties, a distributionally robust\nchance-constrained model is developed to characterize wind power uncertainties\nusing ambiguity sets. Linear decision rules are applied to analytically express\nreal-time recourse actions when uncertainties are exposed, which allows the\npropagation of wind power uncertainties to gas and heat systems. Accordingly,\nthe developed three-stage distributionally robust chance-constrained model is\nconverted into a computationally tractable single-stage mixed-integer conic\nmodel. A case study validates the effectiveness of introducing the electrolyser\nand electric boiler into the integrated energy system, with respect to the\ndecreased system cost, expanded CHP plant flexibility and reduced inverse power\nflow. The developed distributionally robust optimization model exhibits better\neffectiveness and robustness compared to a chance-constrained optimization\nmodel assuming wind forecast errors follow Gaussian distribution.

    "abstract": "Existing public person Re-Identification~(ReID) datasets are small in modern\nterms because of labeling difficulty. Although unlabeled surveillance video is\nabundant and relatively easy to obtain, it is unclear how to leverage these\nfootage to learn meaningful ReID representations. In particular, most existing\nunsupervised and domain adaptation ReID methods utilize only the public\ndatasets in their experiments, with labels removed. In addition, due to small\ndata sizes, these methods usually rely on fine tuning by the unlabeled training\ndata in the testing domain to achieve good performance. Inspired by the recent\nprogress of large-scale self-supervised image classification using contrastive\nlearning, we propose to learn ReID representation from large-scale unlabeled\nsurveillance video alone. Assisted by off-the-shelf pedestrian detection tools,\nwe apply the contrastive loss at both the image and the tracklet levels.\nTogether with a principal component analysis step using camera labels freely\navailable, our evaluation using a large-scale unlabeled dataset shows far\nsuperior performance among unsupervised methods that do not use any training\ndata in the testing domain. Furthermore, the accuracy improves with the data\nsize and therefore our method has great potential with even larger and more\ndiversified datasets.",

    "abstract": "Motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are being\nincreasingly employed to provide alternative means of communication and control\nfor people suffering from neuro-motor impairments, with a special effort to\nbring these systems out of the controlled lab environments. Hence, accurately\nclassifying MI from brain signals, e.g., from electroencephalography (EEG), is\nessential to obtain reliable BCI systems. However, MI classification is still a\nchallenging task, because the signals are characterized by poor SNR, high\nintra-subject and cross-subject variability. Deep learning approaches have\nstarted to emerge as valid alternatives to standard machine learning\ntechniques, e.g., filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP), to extract\nsubject-independent features and to increase the cross-subject classification\nperformance of MI BCI systems. In this paper, we first present a review of the\nmost recent studies using deep learning for MI classification, with particular\nattention to their cross-subject performance. Second, we propose DynamicNet, a\nPython-based tool for quick and flexible implementations of deep learning\nmodels based on convolutional neural networks. We show-case the potentiality of\nDynamicNet by implementing EEGNet, a well-established architecture for\neffective EEG classification. Finally, we compare its performance with FBCSP in\na 4-class MI classification over public datasets. To explore its cross-subject\nclassification ability, we applied three different cross-validation schemes.\nFrom our results, we demonstrate that DynamicNet-implemented EEGNet outperforms\nFBCSP by about 25%, with a statistically significant difference when\ncross-subject validation schemes are applied.",

Each pair of patches in\nBigEarthNet-MM is annotated with multi-labels provided by the CORINE Land Cover\n(CLC) map of 2018 based on its thematically most detailed Level-3 class\nnomenclature. Our initial research demonstrates that some CLC classes are\nchallenging to be accurately described by only considering (single-date)\nBigEarthNet-MM images. In this paper, we also introduce an alternative\nclass-nomenclature as an evolution of the original CLC labels to address this\nproblem. This is achieved by interpreting and arranging the CLC Level-3\nnomenclature based on the properties of BigEarthNet-MM images in a new\nnomenclature of 19 classes. In our experiments, we show the potential of\nBigEarthNet-MM for multi-modal multi-label image retrieval and classification\nproblems by considering several state-of-the-art DL models. We also demonstrate\nthat the DL models trained from scratch on BigEarthNet-MM outperform those\npre-trained on ImageNet, especially in relation to some complex classes,\nincluding agriculture and other vegetated and natural environments.

To further expand the applicability for computer vision,\nmany improved variants are proposed to re-design the Transformer architecture\nby considering the superiority of CNNs, i.e., locality, translation invariance,\nfor better performance. However, these methods only consider the standard\naccuracy or computation cost of the model. In this paper, we rethink the design\nprinciples of ViTs based on the robustness. We found some design components\ngreatly harm the robustness and generalization ability of ViTs while some\nothers are beneficial. By combining the robust design components, we propose\nRobust Vision Transformer (RVT). RVT is a new vision transformer, which has\nsuperior performance and strong robustness. We further propose two new\nplug-and-play techniques called position-aware attention rescaling and\npatch-wise augmentation to train our RVT. The experimental results on ImageNet\nand six robustness benchmarks show the advanced robustness and generalization\nability of RVT compared with previous Transformers and state-of-the-art CNNs.\nOur RVT-S* also achieves Top-1 rank on multiple robustness leaderboards\nincluding ImageNet-C and ImageNet-Sketch.

A stream consists of a\ncontinuous sequence of data elements, which require processing in nearly\nreal-time.

Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of the new Cloud-Fog\ncontinuum raises important challenges related to deploying and executing data\nstream applications. We explore in this work a two-sided stable matching model\ncalled Cloud-Fog to data stream application matching (CODA) for deploying a\ndistributed application represented as a workflow of stream processing\nmicroservices on heterogeneous Cloud-Fog computing resources. In CODA, the\napplication microservices rank the continuum resources based on their\nmicroservice stream processing time, while resources rank the stream processing\nmicroservices based on their residual bandwidth. A stable many-to-one matching\nalgorithm assigns microservices to resources based on their mutual preferences,\naiming to optimize the complete stream processing time on the application side,\nand the total streaming traffic on the resource side.

    "abstract": "Dynamic graph modeling has recently attracted much attention due to its\nextensive applications in many real-world scenarios, such as recommendation\nsystems, financial transactions, and social networks. Although many works have\nbeen proposed for dynamic graph modeling in recent years, effective and\nscalable models are yet to be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel\ngraph neural network approach, called TCL, which deals with the\ndynamically-evolving graph in a continuous-time fashion and enables effective\ndynamic node representation learning that captures both the temporal and\ntopology information. Technically, our model contains three novel aspects.\nFirst, we generalize the vanilla Transformer to temporal graph learning\nscenarios and design a graph-topology-aware transformer. Secondly, on top of\nthe proposed graph transformer, we introduce a two-stream encoder that\nseparately extracts representations from temporal neighborhoods associated with\nthe two interaction nodes and then utilizes a co-attentional transformer to\nmodel inter-dependencies at a semantic level. Lastly, we are inspired by the\nrecently developed contrastive learning and propose to optimize our model by\nmaximizing mutual information (MI) between the predictive representations of\ntwo future interaction nodes. Benefiting from this, our dynamic representations\ncan preserve high-level (or global) semantics about interactions and thus is\nrobust to noisy interactions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nattempt to apply contrastive learning to representation learning on dynamic\ngraphs. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets for interaction\nprediction and experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our model.",

    "title": "Pedestrian Path Modification Mobile Tool for COVID-19 Social Distancing  for Use in Multi-Modal Trip Navigation",
    "abstract": "The novel Corona virus pandemic is one of the biggest worldwide problems\nright now. While hygiene and wearing masks make up a large portion of the\ncurrently suggested precautions by the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO), social distancing is\nanother and arguably the most important precaution that would protect people\nsince the airborne virus is easily transmitted through the air. Social\ndistancing while walking outside, can be more effective, if pedestrians know\nlocations of each other and even better if they know locations of people who\nare possible carriers. With this information, they can change their routes\ndepending on the people walking nearby or they can stay away from areas that\ncontain or have recently contained crowds. This paper presents a mobile device\napplication that would be a very beneficial tool for social distancing during\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The application works, synced close to\nreal-time, in a networking fashion with all users obtaining their locations and\ndrawing a virtual safety bubble around them. These safety bubbles are used with\nthe constant velocity pedestrian model to predict possible future social\ndistancing violations and warn the user with sound and vibration. Moreover, it\ntakes into account the virus staying airborne for a certain time, hence,\ncreating time-decaying non-safe areas in the past trajectories of the users.\nThe mobile app generates collision free paths for navigating around the\nundesired locations for the pedestrian mode of transportation when used as part\nof a multi-modal trip planning app. Results are applicable to other modes of\ntransportation also. Features and the methods used for implementation are\ndiscussed in the paper. The application is tested using previously collected\nreal pedestrian walking data in a realistic environment.",

    "abstract": "A key feature of intelligent behaviour is the ability to learn abstract\nstrategies that scale and transfer to unfamiliar problems. An abstract strategy\nsolves every sample from a problem class, no matter its representation or\ncomplexity -- like algorithms in computer science. Neural networks are powerful\nmodels for processing sensory data, discovering hidden patterns, and learning\ncomplex functions, but they struggle to learn such iterative, sequential or\nhierarchical algorithmic strategies. Extending neural networks with external\nmemories has increased their capacities in learning such strategies, but they\nare still prone to data variations, struggle to learn scalable and transferable\nsolutions, and require massive training data. We present the Neural Harvard\nComputer (NHC), a memory-augmented network based architecture, that employs\nabstraction by decoupling algorithmic operations from data manipulations,\nrealized by splitting the information flow and separated modules. This\nabstraction mechanism and evolutionary training enable the learning of robust\nand scalable algorithmic solutions. On a diverse set of 11 algorithms with\nvarying complexities, we show that the NHC reliably learns algorithmic\nsolutions with strong generalization and abstraction: perfect generalization\nand scaling to arbitrary task configurations and complexities far beyond seen\nduring training, and being independent of the data representation and the task\ndomain.",

    "abstract": "Standard methods in preference learning involve estimating the parameters of\ndiscrete choice models from data of selections (choices) made by individuals\nfrom a discrete set of alternatives (the choice set). While there are many\nmodels for individual preferences, existing learning methods overlook how\nchoice set assignment affects the data. Often, the choice set itself is\ninfluenced by an individual's preferences; for instance, a consumer choosing a\nproduct from an online retailer is often presented with options from a\nrecommender system that depend on information about the consumer's preferences.\nIgnoring these assignment mechanisms can mislead choice models into making\nbiased estimates of preferences, a phenomenon that we call choice set\nconfounding; we demonstrate the presence of such confounding in widely-used\nchoice datasets.\nTo address this issue, we adapt methods from causal inference to the discrete\nchoice setting. We use covariates of the chooser for inverse probability\nweighting and/or regression controls, accurately recovering individual\npreferences in the presence of choice set confounding under certain\nassumptions. When such covariates are unavailable or inadequate, we develop\nmethods that take advantage of structured choice set assignment to improve\nprediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on real-world\nchoice data, showing, for example, that accounting for choice set confounding\nmakes choices observed in hotel booking and commute transportation more\nconsistent with rational utility-maximization.",

    "abstract": "In addition to their undisputed success in solving classical optimization\nproblems, neuroevolutionary and population-based algorithms have become an\nalternative to standard reinforcement learning methods. However, evolutionary\nmethods often lack the sample efficiency of standard value-based methods that\nleverage gathered state and value experience. If reinforcement learning for\nreal-world problems with significant resource cost is considered, sample\nefficiency is essential. The enhancement of evolutionary algorithms with\nexperience exploiting methods is thus desired and promises valuable insights.\nThis work presents a hybrid algorithm that combines topology-changing\nneuroevolutionary optimization with value-based reinforcement learning. We\nillustrate how the behavior of policies can be used to create distance and loss\nfunctions, which benefit from stored experiences and calculated state values.\nThey allow us to model behavior and perform a directed search in the behavior\nspace by gradient-free evolutionary algorithms and surrogate-based\noptimization. For this purpose, we consolidate different methods to generate\nand optimize agent policies, creating a diverse population. We exemplify the\nperformance of our algorithm on standard benchmarks and a purpose-built\nreal-world problem. Our results indicate that combining methods can enhance the\nsample efficiency and learning speed for evolutionary approaches.",

    "abstract": "Unless special conditions apply, the attempt to solve ill-conditioned systems\nof linear equations with standard numerical methods leads to uncontrollably\nhigh numerical error. Often, such systems arise from the discretization of\noperator equations with a large number of discrete variables. In this paper we\nshow that the accuracy can be improved significantly if the equation is\ntransformed before discretization, a process we call full operator\npreconditioning (FOP). It bears many similarities with traditional\npreconditioning for iterative methods but, crucially, transformations are\napplied at the operator level. We show that while condition-number improvements\nfrom traditional preconditioning generally do not improve the accuracy of the\nsolution, FOP can. A number of topics in numerical analysis can be interpreted\nas implicitly employing FOP; we highlight (i) Chebyshev interpolation in\npolynomial approximation, and (ii) Olver-Townsend's spectral method, both of\nwhich produce solutions of dramatically improved accuracy over a naive problem\nformulation. In addition, we propose a FOP preconditioner based on integration\nfor the solution of fourth-order differential equations with the finite-element\nmethod, showing the resulting linear system is well-conditioned regardless of\nthe discretization size, and demonstrate its error-reduction capabilities on\nseveral examples. This work shows that FOP can improve accuracy beyond the\nstandard limit for both direct and iterative methods.",

As individuals, contributors compete to align Wikipedia articles\nwith their personal perspectives. As a community, they work collectively to\nensure a neutral point of view (NPOV). We study the interplay between\nindividuals' competition and the community's endeavor to ensure neutrality. We\ndevelop a two-level game-theoretic model, modeling the interactions of\nownership-motivated individuals and neutrality-seeking communal mechanisms as a\nStackelberg game. We present our model's predictions regarding the relation\nbetween contributors' effort (i.e. typical size of edit) and benefits (i.e. the\nportion of the article they eventually ``own''). We validate the model's\nprediction through an empirical analysis, by studying the interactions of\n219,811 distinct contributors that co-produced 864 Wikipedia articles over a\ndecade. The analysis and empirical results suggest that contributors who make\nlarge edits (``creators'') eventually lose the article's ownership to those who\nrefine the articles and typically make smaller edits (``curators'').

A large\nclass of latent variable models, such as adversarial clustering, mixed\nmembership stochastic block models, and topic models can be cast as learning a\nlatent simplex. Bhattacharyya and Kannan (SODA, 2020) give an algorithm for\nlearning such a latent simplex in time roughly $O(k\\cdot\\textrm{nnz}(A))$,\nwhere $\\textrm{nnz}(A)$ is the number of non-zeros in $A$. We show that the\ndependence on $k$ in the running time is unnecessary given a natural assumption\nabout the mass of the top $k$ singular values of $A$, which holds in many of\nthese applications. Further, we show this assumption is necessary, as otherwise\nan algorithm for learning a latent simplex would imply an algorithmic\nbreakthrough for spectral low rank approximation.\nAt a high level, Bhattacharyya and Kannan provide an adaptive algorithm that\nmakes $k$ matrix-vector product queries to $A$ and each query is a function of\nall queries preceding it. Since each matrix-vector product requires\n$\\textrm{nnz}(A)$ time, their overall running time appears unavoidable.\nInstead, we obtain a low-rank approximation to $A$ in input-sparsity time and\nshow that the column space thus obtained has small $\\sin\\Theta$ (angular)\ndistance to the right top-$k$ singular space of $A$. Our algorithm then selects\n$k$ points in the low-rank subspace with the largest inner product with $k$\ncarefully chosen random vectors.

    "abstract": "Network Embedding aims to learn a function mapping the nodes to Euclidean\nspace contribute to multiple learning analysis tasks on networks. However, the\nnoisy information behind the real-world networks and the overfitting problem\nboth negatively impact the quality of embedding vectors. To tackle these\nproblems, researchers utilize Adversarial Training for Network Embedding\n(AdvTNE) and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Unlike the mainstream\nmethods introducing perturbations on the network structure or the data feature,\nAdvTNE directly perturbs the model parameters, which provides a new chance to\nunderstand the mechanism behind. In this paper, we explain AdvTNE theoretically\nfrom an optimization perspective. Considering the Power-law property of\nnetworks and the optimization objective, we analyze the reason for its\nexcellent results. According to the above analysis, we propose a new activation\nto enhance the performance of AdvTNE. We conduct extensive experiments on four\nreal networks to validate the effectiveness of our method in node\nclassification and link prediction. The results demonstrate that our method is\nsuperior to the state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "Natural language contexts display logical regularities with respect to\nsubstitutions of related concepts: these are captured in a functional\norder-theoretic property called monotonicity. For a certain class of NLI\nproblems where the resulting entailment label depends only on the context\nmonotonicity and the relation between the substituted concepts, we build on\nprevious techniques that aim to improve the performance of NLI models for these\nproblems, as consistent performance across both upward and downward monotone\ncontexts still seems difficult to attain even for state-of-the-art models. To\nthis end, we reframe the problem of context monotonicity classification to make\nit compatible with transformer-based pre-trained NLI models and add this task\nto the training pipeline. Furthermore, we introduce a sound and complete\nsimplified monotonicity logic formalism which describes our treatment of\ncontexts as abstract units. Using the notions in our formalism, we adapt\ntargeted challenge sets to investigate whether an intermediate context\nmonotonicity classification task can aid NLI models' performance on examples\nexhibiting monotonicity reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Despite years of research for improving accuracy, software practitioners\nstill face software estimation difficulties. Expert judgment has been the\nprevalent method used in industry, and researchers' focus on raising realism in\nestimates when using it seems not to be enough for the much-expected\nimprovements. Instead of focusing on the estimation process's technicalities,\nwe investigated the interaction of the establishment of commitments with\ncustomers and software estimation. By observing estimation sessions and\ninterviewing software professionals from companies in varying contexts, we\nfound that defensible estimates and padding of software estimates are crucial\nin converting estimates into commitments. Our findings show that software\nprofessionals use padding for three different reasons: contingency buffer,\ncompleting other tasks, or improving the overall quality of the product. The\nreasons to pad have a common theme: buying time to balance short- and long-term\nsoftware development commitments, including the repayment of technical debt.\nSuch a theme emerged from the human aspects of the interaction of estimation\nand the establishment of commitments: pressures and customers' conflicting\nshort and long-term needs play silent and unrevealed roles in-between the\ntechnical activities. Therefore, our study contributes to untangling the\nunderlying phenomena, showing how the practices used by software practitioners\nhelp to deal with the human and social context in which estimation is embedded.",

    "abstract": "Low-complexity models such as linear function representation play a pivotal\nrole in enabling sample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL). The current\npaper pertains to a scenario with value-based linear representation, which\npostulates the linear realizability of the optimal Q-function (also called the\n\"linear $Q^{\\star}$ problem\"). While linear realizability alone does not allow\nfor sample-efficient solutions in general, the presence of a large\nsub-optimality gap is a potential game changer, depending on the sampling\nmechanism in use. Informally, sample efficiency is achievable with a large\nsub-optimality gap when a generative model is available but is unfortunately\ninfeasible when we turn to standard online RL settings.\nIn this paper, we make progress towards understanding this linear $Q^{\\star}$\nproblem by investigating a new sampling protocol, which draws samples in an\nonline/exploratory fashion but allows one to backtrack and revisit previous\nstates in a controlled and infrequent manner. This protocol is more flexible\nthan the standard online RL setting, while being practically relevant and far\nmore restrictive than the generative model. We develop an algorithm tailored to\nthis setting, achieving a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the\nfeature dimension, the horizon, and the inverse sub-optimality gap, but not the\nsize of the state/action space. Our findings underscore the fundamental\ninterplay between sampling protocols and low-complexity structural\nrepresentation in RL.",

    "title": "A feasibility study of a hyperparameter tuning approach to automated  inverse planning in radiotherapy",
    "abstract": "Radiotherapy inverse planning requires treatment planners to modify multiple\nparameters in the objective function to produce clinically acceptable plans.\nDue to manual steps in this process, plan quality can vary widely depending on\nplanning time available and planner's skills. The purpose of this study is to\nautomate the inverse planning process to reduce active planning time while\nmaintaining plan quality. We propose a hyperparameter tuning approach for\nautomated inverse planning, where a treatment plan utility is maximized with\nrespect to the limit dose parameters and weights of each organ-at-risk (OAR)\nobjective. Using 6 patient cases, we investigated the impact of the choice of\ndose parameters, random and Bayesian search methods, and utility function form\non planning time and plan quality. For given parameters, the plan was optimized\nin RayStation, using the scripting interface to obtain the dose distributions\ndeliverable. We normalized all plans to have the same target coverage and\ncompared the OAR dose metrics in the automatically generated plans with those\nin the manually generated clinical plans. Using 100 samples was found to\nproduce satisfactory plan quality, and the average planning time was 2.3 hours.\nThe OAR doses in the automatically generated plans were lower than the clinical\nplans by up to 76.8%. When the OAR doses were larger than the clinical plans,\nthey were still between 0.57% above and 98.9% below the limit doses, indicating\nthey are clinically acceptable. For a challenging case, a dimensionality\nreduction strategy produced a 92.9% higher utility using only 38.5% of the time\nneeded to optimize over the original problem. This study demonstrates our\nhyperparameter tuning framework for automated inverse planning can\nsignificantly reduce the treatment planner's planning time with plan quality\nthat is similar to or better than manually generated plans.",

However, the non-uniqueness of\nthese representatives creates ambiguity and can lead to many different\ninterpretations of the same set of classes. One approach to solving this\nproblem is to optimize the choice of representative against some measure that\nis meaningful in the context of the data. In this work, we provide a study of\nthe effectiveness and computational cost of several $\\ell_1$-minimization\noptimization procedures for constructing homological cycle bases for persistent\nhomology with rational coefficients in dimension one, including\nuniform-weighted and length-weighted edge-loss algorithms as well as\nuniform-weighted and area-weighted triangle-loss algorithms. We conduct these\noptimizations via standard linear programming methods, applying general-purpose\nsolvers to optimize over column bases of simplicial boundary matrices.\nOur key findings are: (i) optimization is effective in reducing the size of\ncycle representatives, (ii) the computational cost of optimizing a basis of\ncycle representatives exceeds the cost of computing such a basis in most data\nsets we consider, (iii) the choice of linear solvers matters a lot to the\ncomputation time of optimizing cycles, (iv) the computation time of solving an\ninteger program is not significantly longer than the computation time of\nsolving a linear program for most of the cycle representatives, using the\nGurobi linear solver, (v) strikingly, whether requiring integer solutions or\nnot, we almost always obtain a solution with the same cost and almost all\nsolutions found have entries in {-1, 0, 1} and therefore, are also solutions to\na restricted $\\ell_0$ optimization problem, and (vi) we obtain qualitatively\ndifferent results for generators in Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random clique complexes.",

We consider its quantum\ncounterpart, the private simultaneous quantum messages (PSQM) model, and\nexamine the advantages of quantum communication and prior entanglement of this\nmodel. In the PSQM model, $k$ parties $P_1,\\ldots,P_k$ initially share a common\nrandom string (or entangled states in a stronger setting), and they have\nprivate classical inputs $x_1,\\ldots, x_k$. Every $P_i$ generates a quantum\nmessage from the private input $x_i$ and the shared random string (entangled\nstates), and then sends it to the referee $R$.

It is desirable to\ndevelop image quality assessment (IQA) methods that can not only evaluate and\ncompare SISR algorithms, but also guide their future development. In this\npaper, we assess the quality of SISR generated images in a two-dimensional (2D)\nspace of structural fidelity versus statistical naturalness. This allows us to\nobserve the behaviors of different SISR algorithms as a tradeoff in the 2D\nspace. Specifically, SISR methods are traditionally designed to achieve high\nstructural fidelity but often sacrifice statistical naturalness, while recent\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) based algorithms tend to create more\nnatural-looking results but lose significantly on structural fidelity.\nFurthermore, such a 2D evaluation can be easily fused to a scalar quality\nprediction. Interestingly, we find that a simple linear combination of a\nstraightforward local structural fidelity and a global statistical naturalness\nmeasures produce surprisingly accurate predictions of SISR image quality when\ntested using public subject-rated SISR image datasets.

    "abstract": "Consensus of autonomous agents is a benchmark problem in multi-agent control.\nIn this paper, we consider continuous-time averaging consensus policies (or\nLaplacian flows) and their discrete-time counterparts over time-varying graphs\nin presence of unknown but bounded communication delays. It is known that\nconsensus is established (no matter how large the delays are) if the graph is\nperiodically, or uniformly quasi-strongly connected (UQSC). The UQSC condition\nis often believed to be the weakest sufficient condition under which consensus\ncan be proved. We show that the UQSC condition can actually be substantially\nrelaxed and replaced by a condition that we call aperiodic quasi-strong\nconnectivity (AQSC), which, in some sense, proves to be very close to the\nnecessary condition of integral connectivity. Furthermore, in some special\nsituations such as undirected or type-symmetric graph, we find a necessary and\nsufficient condition for consensus in presence of bounded delay; the relevant\nresults have been previously proved only in the undelayed case. The consensus\ncriteria established in this paper generalize a number of results known in the\nliterature.",

We study two types of attacks on\nautomated quantum communications protocols and simulate these attacks on the\nsuperdense coding protocol, using remote access to IBM's Quantum Computers\navailable through IBM Q Experience to simulate these attacks on what would be a\nlow noise quantum communications network. The first type of attack leads to a\nhacker-controlled bijective transformation of the final measured strings, the\nsecond type of attack is a unitary scrambling attack that modifies the\nautomated gate specification to effectively scramble the final measurement,\ndisrupting quantum communications and taking advantage of quantum randomness\nupon measurement in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish from hardware\nmalfunction or from a sudden rise in environmental noise. We show that, due to\nquantum entanglement and symmetries, the second type of attack works as a way\nto strategically disrupt quantum communications networks and quantum networked\ncomputation in a way that makes it difficult to ascertain which node was\nattacked.

    "abstract": "Digital pathology slide is easy to store and manage, convenient to browse and\ntransmit. However, because of the high-resolution scan for example 40 times\nmagnification(40X) during the digitization, the file size of each whole slide\nimage exceeds 1Gigabyte, which eventually leads to huge storage capacity and\nvery slow network transmission. We design a strategy to scan slides with low\nresolution (5X) and a super-resolution method is proposed to restore the image\ndetails when in diagnosis. The method is based on a multi-scale generative\nadversarial network, which sequentially generate three high-resolution images\nsuch as 10X, 20X and 40X. The perceived loss, generator loss of the generated\nimages and real images are compared on three image resolutions, and a\ndiscriminator is used to evaluate the difference of highest-resolution\ngenerated image and real image. A dataset consisting of 100,000 pathological\nimages from 10 types of human tissues is performed for training and testing the\nnetwork. The generated images have high peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and\nstructural-similarity-index (SSIM). The PSNR of 10X to 40X image are 24.16,\n22.27 and 20.44, and the SSIM are 0.845, 0.680 and 0.512, which are better than\nother super-resolution networks such as DBPN, ESPCN, RDN, EDSR and MDSR.\nMoreover, visual inspections show that the generated high-resolution images by\nour network have enough details for diagnosis, good color reproduction and\nclose to real images, while other five networks are severely blurred, local\ndeformation or miss important details. Moreover, no significant differences can\nbe found on pathological diagnosis based on the generated and real images. The\nproposed multi-scale network can generate good high-resolution pathological\nimages, and will provide a low-cost storage (about 15MB/image on 5X), faster\nimage sharing method for digital pathology.",

To motivate a brain basis of neural\ncomputation, we present a dynamical view of intelligence from which we\nelaborate concepts of sparsity in network structure, temporal dynamics, and\ninteractive learning. In particular, we suggest that temporal dynamics, as\nexpressed through neural synchrony, nested oscillations, and flexible\nsequences, provide a rich computational layer for reading and updating\nhierarchical models distributed in long-term memory networks. Moreover,\nembracing agent-centered paradigms in AI and CN will accelerate our\nunderstanding of the complex dynamics and behaviors that build useful world\nmodels.

    "abstract": "We propose a randomized algorithm with quadratic convergence rate for convex\noptimization problems with a self-concordant, composite, strongly convex\nobjective function. Our method is based on performing an approximate Newton\nstep using a random projection of the Hessian. Our first contribution is to\nshow that, at each iteration, the embedding dimension (or sketch size) can be\nas small as the effective dimension of the Hessian matrix. Leveraging this\nnovel fundamental result, we design an algorithm with a sketch size\nproportional to the effective dimension and which exhibits a quadratic rate of\nconvergence. This result dramatically improves on the classical\nlinear-quadratic convergence rates of state-of-the-art sub-sampled Newton\nmethods. However, in most practical cases, the effective dimension is not known\nbeforehand, and this raises the question of how to pick a sketch size as small\nas the effective dimension while preserving a quadratic convergence rate. Our\nsecond and main contribution is thus to propose an adaptive sketch size\nalgorithm with quadratic convergence rate and which does not require prior\nknowledge or estimation of the effective dimension: at each iteration, it\nstarts with a small sketch size, and increases it until quadratic progress is\nachieved. Importantly, we show that the embedding dimension remains\nproportional to the effective dimension throughout the entire path and that our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art computational complexity for solving convex\noptimization programs with a strongly convex component.",

We\ncharacterize the scaling behavior of the achievable cost in three models as a\nfunction of the dimension d: (i) Static matching of N demand units with N+M\nsupply units. (ii) A semi-dynamic model where N+M supply units are present\nbeforehand and N demand units arrive sequentially and must be matched\nimmediately. (iii) A fully dynamic model where there are always m supply units\npresent in the system, one supply and one demand unit arrive in each period,\nand the demand must be matched immediately. We show that one can achieve nearly\nthe same cost under the semi-dynamic model as under the static model, despite\nuncertainty about the future, and that, under these two models, d=1 is the only\ncase where cost far exceeds distance to the nearest neighbor (which is\n\\Theta(1/N^{1/d})) and where adding excess supply M substantially reduces cost\n(by smoothing stochastic fluctuations at larger spatial length scales). In the\nfully dynamic model, we show that, remarkably, for all d we can achieve a cost\nonly slightly more than the optimistic distance to the nearest neighbor\n\\Theta(1/m^{1/d}). Thus, excess supply m reduces cost in the fully dynamic\nmodel for all $d$ by reducing the distance to the nearest neighbor. This is a\nfundamentally different phenomenon than that seen in the other two models,\nwhere excess supply reduces cost while leaving the distance to the nearest\nneighbor unchanged, only for d=1.

While a line of studies has been proposed with respect\nto avoiding catastrophic forgetting, most of the methods are based on intuitive\ninsights into the phenomenon, and their performances have been evaluated by\nnumerical experiments using benchmark datasets. Therefore, in this study, we\nprovide the theoretical framework for analyzing catastrophic forgetting by\nusing teacher-student learning. Teacher-student learning is a framework in\nwhich we introduce two neural networks: one neural network is a target function\nin supervised learning, and the other is a learning neural network. To analyze\ncontinual learning in the teacher-student framework, we introduce the\nsimilarity of the input distribution and the input-output relationship of the\ntarget functions as the similarity of tasks. In this theoretical framework, we\nalso provide a qualitative understanding of how a single-layer linear learning\nneural network forgets tasks. Based on the analysis, we find that the network\ncan avoid catastrophic forgetting when the similarity among input distributions\nis small and that of the input-output relationship of the target functions is\nlarge. The analysis also suggests that a system often exhibits a characteristic\nphenomenon called overshoot, which means that even if the learning network has\nonce undergone catastrophic forgetting, it is possible that the network may\nperform reasonably well after further learning of the current task.",

Novel emerging\napproaches include (i) geometric learning, i.e. learning on representations\nsuch as graphs, 3D Voronoi tessellations, and point clouds; (ii) pre-trained\nprotein language models leveraging attention; (iii) equivariant architectures\npreserving the symmetry of 3D space; (iv) use of large meta-genome databases;\n(v) combinations of protein representations; (vi) and finally truly end-to-end\narchitectures, i.e. differentiable models starting from a sequence and\nreturning a 3D structure. Here, we provide an overview and our opinion of the\nnovel deep learning approaches developed in the last two years and widely used\nin CASP14.",

    "abstract": "Methods based on convolutional neural networks have improved the performance\nof biomedical image segmentation. However, most of these methods cannot\nefficiently segment objects of variable sizes and train on small and biased\ndatasets, which are common in biomedical use cases. While methods exist that\nincorporate multi-scale fusion approaches to address the challenges arising\nwith variable sizes, they usually use complex models that are more suitable for\ngeneral semantic segmentation computer vision problems. In this paper, we\npropose a novel architecture called MSRF-Net, which is specially designed for\nmedical image segmentation tasks. The proposed MSRF-Net is able to exchange\nmulti-scale features of varying receptive fields using a dual-scale dense\nfusion block (DSDF). Our DSDF block can exchange information rigorously across\ntwo different resolution scales, and our MSRF sub-network uses multiple DSDF\nblocks in sequence to perform multi-scale fusion. This allows the preservation\nof resolution, improved information flow, and propagation of both high- and\nlow-level features to obtain accurate segmentation maps. The proposed MSRF-Net\nallows to capture object variabilities and provides improved results on\ndifferent biomedical datasets. Extensive experiments on MSRF-Net demonstrate\nthat the proposed method outperforms most of the cutting-edge medical image\nsegmentation state-of-the-art methods. MSRF-Net advances the performance on\nfour publicly available datasets, and also, MSRF-Net is more generalizable as\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a top-10 cause of death worldwide. Though the WHO\nrecommends chest radiographs (CXRs) for TB screening, the limited availability\nof CXR interpretation is a barrier. We trained a deep learning system (DLS) to\ndetect active pulmonary TB using CXRs from 9 countries across Africa, Asia, and\nEurope, and utilized large-scale CXR pretraining, attention pooling, and noisy\nstudent semi-supervised learning. Evaluation was on (1) a combined test set\nspanning China, India, US, and Zambia, and (2) an independent mining population\nin South Africa. Given WHO targets of 90% sensitivity and 70% specificity, the\nDLS's operating point was prespecified to favor sensitivity over specificity.\nOn the combined test set, the DLS's ROC curve was above all 9 India-based\nradiologists, with an AUC of 0.90 (95%CI 0.87-0.92). The DLS's sensitivity\n(88%) was higher than the India-based radiologists (75% mean sensitivity),\np<0.001 for superiority; and its specificity (79%) was non-inferior to the\nradiologists (84% mean specificity), p=0.004. Similar trends were observed\nwithin HIV positive and sputum smear positive sub-groups, and in the South\nAfrica test set. We found that 5 US-based radiologists (where TB isn't endemic)\nwere more sensitive and less specific than the India-based radiologists (where\nTB is endemic). The DLS also remained non-inferior to the US-based\nradiologists. In simulations, using the DLS as a prioritization tool for\nconfirmatory testing reduced the cost per positive case detected by 40-80%\ncompared to using confirmatory testing alone. To conclude, our DLS generalized\nto 5 countries, and merits prospective evaluation to assist cost-effective\nscreening efforts in radiologist-limited settings. Operating point flexibility\nmay permit customization of the DLS to account for site-specific factors such\nas TB prevalence, demographics, clinical resources, and customary practice\npatterns.",

In this work, we propose an adaptation of the Neural\nStyle Transfer (NST) as a novel image pre-processing step for skin lesion\nclassification problems. We represent each dermoscopic image as the style image\nand transfer the style of the lesion onto a homogeneous content image. This\ntransfers the main variability of each lesion onto the same localized region,\nwhich allows us to integrate the generated images together and extract latent,\nlow-rank style features via tensor decomposition. We train and cross-validate\nour model on a dermoscopic data set collected and preprocessed from the\nInternational Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) database. We show that the\nclassification performance based on the extracted tensor features using the\nstyle-transferred images significantly outperforms that of the raw images by\nmore than 10%, and is also competitive with well-studied, pre-trained CNN\nmodels through transfer learning.

In recent\nyears, there have been tremendous improvements in the architecture design,\npushing the performance up in various prediction tasks. In general, these\nneural architectures combine layer depth and node feature aggregation steps.\nThis makes it challenging to analyze the importance of features at various hops\nand the expressiveness of the neural network layers. As different graph\ndatasets show varying levels of homophily and heterophily in features and class\nlabel distribution, it becomes essential to understand which features are\nimportant for the prediction tasks without any prior information. In this work,\nwe decouple the node feature aggregation step and depth of graph neural network\nand introduce several key design strategies for graph neural networks. More\nspecifically, we propose to use softmax as a regularizer and \"Soft-Selector\" of\nfeatures aggregated from neighbors at different hop distances; and\n\"Hop-Normalization\" over GNN layers. Combining these techniques, we present a\nsimple and shallow model, Feature Selection Graph Neural Network (FSGNN), and\nshow empirically that the proposed model outperforms other state of the art GNN\nmodels and achieves up to 64% improvements in accuracy on node classification\ntasks.

We found that FBT gives a shorter input dimension\nreducing the training time without affecting the sensitivity and specificity of\nclassification. We employed the deep learning techniques, mainly CNN and\nrecurrent neural network with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and random forest\n(RF) classifier for promoter classification at k-mer sizes of 2, 4 and 8. We\nfound CNN to be superior in classification of promoters from non-promoter\nsequences (binary classification) as well as species-specific classification of\npromoter sequences (multiclass classification). In summary, the contribution of\nthis work lies in the use of synthetic shuffled negative dataset and\nfrequency-based tokenization for pre-processing. This study provides a\ncomprehensive and generic framework for classification tasks in genomic\napplications and can be extended to various classification problems.",

Focusing on a CRM dataset with several different\ncategories of factors that impact customer heterogeneity (i.e., usage of\nself-care service channels, duration of service, and responsiveness to\nmarketing actions), we provide new predictive analytics of customer churn rate\nbased on a machine learning method that enhances the classification of logistic\nregression by adding a mixed penalty term. The proposed penalized logistic\nregression can prevent overfitting when dealing with big data and minimize the\nloss function when balancing the cost from the median (absolute value) and mean\n(squared value) regularization. We show the analytical properties of the\nproposed method and its computational advantage in this research.

    "abstract": "Individuals of modern societies share ideas and participate in collective\nprocesses within a pervasive, variable, and mostly hidden ecosystem of content\nfiltering technologies that determine what information we see online. Despite\nthe impact of these algorithms on daily life and society, little is known about\ntheir effect on information transfer and opinion formation. It is thus unclear\nto what extent algorithmic bias has a harmful influence on collective\ndecision-making, such as a tendency to polarize debate. Here we introduce a\ngeneral theoretical framework to systematically link models of opinion\ndynamics, social network structure, and content filtering. We showcase the\nflexibility of our framework by exploring a family of binary-state opinion\ndynamics models where information exchange lies in a spectrum from pairwise to\ngroup interactions. All models show an opinion polarization regime driven by\nalgorithmic bias and modular network structure. The role of content filtering\nis, however, surprisingly nuanced; for pairwise interactions it leads to\npolarization, while for group interactions it promotes coexistence of opinions.\nThis allows us to pinpoint which social interactions are robust against\nalgorithmic bias, and which ones are susceptible to bias-enhanced opinion\npolarization. Our framework gives theoretical ground for the development of\nheuristics to tackle harmful effects of online bias, such as information\nbottlenecks, echo chambers, and opinion radicalization.",

    "abstract": "The rapid increment of morbidity of brain stroke in the last few years have\nbeen a driving force towards fast and accurate segmentation of stroke lesions\nfrom brain MRI images. With the recent development of deep-learning,\ncomputer-aided and segmentation methods of ischemic stroke lesions have been\nuseful for clinicians in early diagnosis and treatment planning. However, most\nof these methods suffer from inaccurate and unreliable segmentation results\nbecause of their inability to capture sufficient contextual features from the\nMRI volumes. To meet these requirements, 3D convolutional neural networks have\nbeen proposed, which, however, suffer from huge computational requirements. To\nmitigate these problems, we propose a novel Dimension Fusion Edge-guided\nnetwork (DFENet) that can meet both of these requirements by fusing the\nfeatures of 2D and 3D CNNs. Unlike other methods, our proposed network uses a\nparallel partial decoder (PPD) module for aggregating and upsampling selected\nfeatures, rich in important contextual information. Additionally, we use an\nedge-guidance and enhanced mixing loss for constantly supervising and\nimprovising the learning process of the network. The proposed method is\nevaluated on publicly available Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke\n(ATLAS) dataset, resulting in mean DSC, IoU, Precision and Recall values of\n0.5457, 0.4015, 0.6371, and 0.4969 respectively.

    "abstract": "A notion of $t$-designs in the symmetric group on $n$ letters was introduced\nby Godsil in 1988. In particular $t$-transitive sets of permutations form a\n$t$-design. We derive lower bounds for $t=1$ and $t=2$ by a power moment\nmethod. For general $n,$ and $t\\le n/2,$ we give a linear programming lower\nbound involving Charlier polynomials. For specific $n$ and $t=2,$ this bound is\nstrong enough to show that sharply transitive $2$-designs do not exist for many\ncomposite integers $n.$ This implies the non-existence of projective planes of\norder $10,15,18,24,26,28,33,35.$ In general, based on numerical evidence, we\nconjecture that $t$-designs have size $n(n-1)\\dots (n-t+1),$ or larger.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a uniqueness Shapley measure to compare the extent to\nwhich different variables are able to identify a subject. Revealing the value\nof a variable on subject $t$ shrinks the set of possible subjects that $t$\ncould be. The extent of the shrinkage depends on which other variables have\nalso been revealed. We use Shapley value to combine all of the reductions in\nlog cardinality due to revealing a variable after some subset of the other\nvariables has been revealed. This uniqueness Shapley measure can be aggregated\nover subjects where it becomes a weighted sum of conditional entropies.\nAggregation over subsets of subjects can address questions like how identifying\nis age for people of a given zip code. Such aggregates have a corresponding\nexpression in terms of cross entropies. We use uniqueness Shapley to\ninvestigate the differential effects of revealing variables from the North\nCarolina voter registration rolls and in identifying anomalous solar flares. An\nenormous speedup (approaching 2000 fold in one example) is obtained by using\nthe all dimension trees of Moore and Lee (1998) to store the cardinalities we\nneed.",

    "title": "Removing Data Heterogeneity Influence Enhances Network Topology  Dependence of Decentralized SGD",
    "abstract": "We consider decentralized stochastic optimization problems where a network of\nagents each owns a local cost function cooperate to find a minimizer of the\nglobal-averaged cost. A widely studied decentralized algorithm for this problem\nis D-SGD in which each node applies a stochastic gradient descent step, then\naverages its estimate with its neighbors. D-SGD is attractive due to its\nefficient single-iteration communication and can achieve linear speedup in\nconvergence (in terms of the network size). However, D-SGD is very sensitive to\nthe network topology. For smooth objective functions, the transient stage\n(which measures how fast the algorithm can reach the linear speedup stage) of\nD-SGD is on the order of $O(n/(1-\\beta)^2)$ and $O(n^3/(1-\\beta)^4)$ for\nstrongly convex and generally convex cost functions, respectively, where\n$1-\\beta \\in (0,1)$ is a topology-dependent quantity that approaches $0$ for a\nlarge and sparse network. Hence, D-SGD suffers from slow convergence for large\nand sparse networks.\nIn this work, we study the non-asymptotic convergence property of the\nD$^2$/Exact-diffusion algorithm. By eliminating the influence of data\nheterogeneity between nodes, D$^2$/Exact-diffusion is shown to have an enhanced\ntransient stage that are on the order of $O(n/(1-\\beta))$ and\n$O(n^3/(1-\\beta)^2)$ for strongly convex and generally convex cost functions,\nrespectively. Moreover, we provide a lower bound of the transient stage of\nD-SGD under homogeneous data distributions, which coincides with the transient\nstage of D$^2$/Exact-diffusion in the strongly-convex setting. These results\nshow that removing the influence of data heterogeneity can ameliorate the\nnetwork topology dependence of D-SGD. Compared with existing decentralized\nalgorithms bounds, D$^2$/Exact-diffusion is least sensitive to network\ntopology.",

    "abstract": "The Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) is a general methodology for\nfunctional interpolation that can embed a set of user-specified linear\nconstraints. The functionals derived from this method, called \\emph{constrained\nexpressions}, analytically satisfy the imposed constraints and can be leveraged\nto transform constrained optimization problems to unconstrained ones. By\nsimplifying the optimization problem, this technique has been shown to produce\na numerical scheme that is faster, more accurate, and robust to poor\ninitialization. The content of this dissertation details the complete\ndevelopment of the Theory of Functional Connections. First, the seminal paper\non the Theory of Functional Connections is discussed and motivates the\ndiscovery of a more general formulation of the constrained expressions.\nLeveraging this formulation, a rigorous structure of the constrained expression\nis produced with associated mathematical definitions, claims, and proofs.\nFurthermore, the second part of this dissertation explains how this technique\ncan be used to solve ordinary differential equations providing a wide variety\nof examples compared to the state-of-the-art. The final part of this work\nfocuses on unitizing the techniques and algorithms produced in the prior\nsections to explore the feasibility of using the Theory of Functional\nConnections to solve real-time optimal control problems, namely optimal landing\nproblems.",

However, due to the\ndifficulty of obtaining matched reference data for supervised learning, there\nhas been increasing interest in unsupervised learning approaches that do not\nneed paired reference data.
