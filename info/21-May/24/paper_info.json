We evaluate our\napproach in two simple examples: a push-block system for benchmarking and a\nsingle-legged hopper.

To perform an automatic diagnosis,\nprostate tissue samples are first digitized into gigapixel-resolution\nwhole-slide images.

In this work, a novel patch\naggregation method based on a custom Wide & Deep neural network model is\npresented, which performs a slide-level classification using the patch-level\nclasses obtained from a CNN. The malignant tissue ratio, a 10-bin malignant\nprobability histogram, the least squares regression line of the histogram, and\nthe number of malignant connected components are used by the proposed model to\nperform the classification.

    "abstract": "This paper concerns the problem of reactive synthesis of systems interacting\nwith its environment via letters from an infinite data domain. Register\nautomata and transducers are popular formalisms for specifying and modeling\nsuch systems. They extend finite-state automata by introducing registers that\nare used to store data and to test incoming data against the stored one. Unlike\nthe standard automata, the expressive power of register automata depends on\nwhether they are deterministic, non-deterministic, or universal. Among these,\nuniversal register automata suit synthesis best as they can specify\nrequest-grant properties and allow for succinct conjunction. Because the\nsynthesis problem from universal register automata is undecidable, researchers\nstudied a decidable variant, called register-bounded synthesis, where\nadditionally a bound on the number of registers in a sought transducer is\ngiven. In those synthesis works, however, automata can only compare data for\nequality, which limits synthesis applications. In this paper, we extend\nregister-bounded synthesis to domains with the natural order <. To this end, we\nprove a key Pumping Lemma for a finite abstraction of behaviour of register\nautomata, which allows us to reduce synthesis to synthesis of register-free\ntransducers. As a result, we show that register-bounded synthesis from\nuniversal register automata over domain (N, <) is decidable in 2ExpTime as in\nthe equality-only case, giving the order for free.",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems (RSs) are software tools and algorithms developed to\nalleviate the problem of information overload, which makes it difficult for a\nuser to make right decisions. Two main paradigms toward the recommendation\nproblem are collaborative filtering and content-based filtering, which try to\nrecommend the best items using ratings and content available. These methods\ntypically face infamous problems including cold-start, diversity, scalability,\nand great computational expense. We argue that the uptake of deep learning and\nreinforcement learning methods is also questionable due to their computational\ncomplexities and uninterpretability. In this paper, we approach the\nrecommendation problem from a new prospective. We borrow ideas from cluster\nhead selection algorithms in wireless sensor networks and adapt them to the\nrecommendation problem. In particular, we propose Load Balanced Recommender\nSystem (LBRS), which uses a probabilistic scheme for item recommendation.\nFurthermore, we factor in the importance of items in the recommendation\nprocess, which significantly improves the recommendation accuracy. We also\nintroduce a method that considers a heterogeneity among items, in order to\nbalance the similarity and diversity trade-off. Finally, we propose a new\nmetric for diversity, which emphasizes the importance of diversity not only\nfrom an intra-list perspective, but also from a between-list point of view.\nWith experiments in a simulation study performed on RecSim, we show that LBRS\nis effective and can outperform baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "In this work we study the problem of measuring the fairness of a machine\nlearning model under noisy information. Focusing on group fairness metrics, we\ninvestigate the particular but common situation when the evaluation requires\ncontrolling for the confounding effect of covariate variables. In a practical\nsetting, we might not be able to jointly observe the covariate and group\ninformation, and a standard workaround is to then use proxies for one or more\nof these variables. Prior works have demonstrated the challenges with using a\nproxy for sensitive attributes, and strong independence assumptions are needed\nto provide guarantees on the accuracy of the noisy estimates. In contrast, in\nthis work we study using a proxy for the covariate variable and present a\ntheoretical analysis that aims to characterize weaker conditions under which\naccurate fairness evaluation is possible.\nFurthermore, our theory identifies potential sources of errors and decouples\nthem into two interpretable parts $\\gamma$ and $\\epsilon$. The first part\n$\\gamma$ depends solely on the performance of the proxy such as precision and\nrecall, whereas the second part $\\epsilon$ captures correlations between all\nthe variables of interest. We show that in many scenarios the error in the\nestimates is dominated by $\\gamma$ via a linear dependence, whereas the\ndependence on the correlations $\\epsilon$ only constitutes a lower order term.\nAs a result we expand the understanding of scenarios where measuring model\nfairness via proxies can be an effective approach. Finally, we compare, via\nsimulations, the theoretical upper-bounds to the distribution of simulated\nestimation errors and show that assuming some structure on the data, even weak,\nis key to significantly improve both theoretical guarantees and empirical\nresults.",

Cardiorespiratory signals were acquired from a\nsmart shirt with integrated textile sensors alongside ground-truth VO$_2$ from\na metabolic system on twenty-two young healthy adults. Participants performed\none ramp-incremental and three pseudorandom binary sequence exercise protocols\nto assess a range of VO$_2$ dynamics.

Optimal history length was determined through minimum\nvalidation loss across hyperparameter values. The best performing model encoded\n218 s history length (TCN-VO$_2$ A), with 187 s, 97 s, and 76 s yielding less\nthan 3% deviation from the optimal validation loss. TCN-VO$_2$ A showed strong\nprediction accuracy (mean, 95% CI) across all exercise intensities (-22\nml.min$^{-1}$, [-262, 218]), spanning transitions from low-moderate (-23\nml.min$^{-1}$, [-250, 204]), low-heavy (14 ml.min$^{-1}$, [-252, 280]),\nventilatory threshold-heavy (-49 ml.min$^{-1}$, [-274, 176]), and maximal (-32\nml.min$^{-1}$, [-261, 197]) exercise.

    "abstract": "We present a simplified, task-agnostic multi-modal pre-training approach that\ncan accept either video or text input, or both for a variety of end tasks.\nExisting pre-training are task-specific by adopting either a single cross-modal\nencoder that requires both modalities, limiting their use for retrieval-style\nend tasks or more complex multitask learning with two unimodal encoders,\nlimiting early cross-modal fusion. We instead introduce new pretraining masking\nschemes that better mix across modalities (e.g. by forcing masks for text to\npredict the closest video embeddings) while also maintaining separability (e.g.\nunimodal predictions are sometimes required, without using all the input).\nExperimental results show strong performance across a wider range of tasks than\nany previous methods, often outperforming task-specific pre-training.",

We resolve this problem by introducing a\nrobust unsupervised multi-object tracking (MOT) model: AttU-Net.

AttU-Net shows\nbetter unsupervised MOT tracking performance over variational inference-based\nstate-of-the-art baselines. We evaluate our method in the MNIST and the Atari\ngame video benchmark.

    "abstract": "This is a short note on the performance of the ALI-G algorithm (Berrada et\nal., 2020) as reported in (Loizou et al., 2021). ALI-G (Berrada et al., 2020)\nand SPS (Loizou et al., 2021) are both adaptations of the Polyak step-size to\noptimize machine learning models that can interpolate the training data. The\nmain algorithmic differences are that (1) SPS employs a multiplicative constant\nin the denominator of the learning-rate while ALI-G uses an additive constant,\nand (2) SPS uses an iteration-dependent maximal learning-rate while ALI-G uses\na constant one. There are also differences in the analysis provided by the two\nworks, with less restrictive assumptions proposed in (Loizou et al., 2021). In\ntheir experiments, (Loizou et al., 2021) did not use momentum for ALI-G (which\nis a standard part of the algorithm) or standard hyper-parameter tuning (for\ne.g. learning-rate and regularization). Hence this note as a reference for the\nimproved performance that ALI-G can obtain with well-chosen hyper-parameters.\nIn particular, we show that when training a ResNet-34 on CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100, the performance of ALI-G can reach respectively 93.5% (+6%) and 76%\n(+8%) with a very small amount of tuning. Thus ALI-G remains a very competitive\nmethod for training interpolating neural networks.",

To this\nend, developers extensively test these systems to eliminate bugs that\nnegatively affect functionality. In addition to functional bugs, however, there\nis another important class of bugs: performance bugs. These bugs negatively\naffect the response time of a database system and can therefore affect the\noverall performance of the system. Despite their impact on end-user experience,\nperformance bugs have received considerably less attention than functional\nbugs.\nIn this paper, we present AMOEBA, a system for automatically detecting\nperformance bugs in database systems. The core idea behind AMOEBA is to\nconstruct query pairs that are semantically equivalent to each other and then\ncompare their response time on the same database system. If the queries exhibit\na significant difference in their runtime performance, then the root cause is\nlikely a performance bug in the system. We propose a novel set of structure and\npredicate mutation rules for constructing query pairs that are likely to\nuncover performance bugs. We introduce feedback mechanisms for improving the\nefficacy and computational efficiency of the tool. We evaluate AMOEBA on two\nwidely-used DBMSs, namely PostgreSQL and CockroachDB.

    "abstract": "Story visualization is an under-explored task that falls at the intersection\nof many important research directions in both computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing. In this task, given a series of natural language captions\nwhich compose a story, an agent must generate a sequence of images that\ncorrespond to the captions. Prior work has introduced recurrent generative\nmodels which outperform text-to-image synthesis models on this task. However,\nthere is room for improvement of generated images in terms of visual quality,\ncoherence and relevance. We present a number of improvements to prior modeling\napproaches, including (1) the addition of a dual learning framework that\nutilizes video captioning to reinforce the semantic alignment between the story\nand generated images, (2) a copy-transform mechanism for\nsequentially-consistent story visualization, and (3) MART-based transformers to\nmodel complex interactions between frames. We present ablation studies to\ndemonstrate the effect of each of these techniques on the generative power of\nthe model for both individual images as well as the entire narrative.\nFurthermore, due to the complexity and generative nature of the task, standard\nevaluation metrics do not accurately reflect performance. Therefore, we also\nprovide an exploration of evaluation metrics for the model, focused on aspects\nof the generated frames such as the presence/quality of generated characters,\nthe relevance to captions, and the diversity of the generated images.

By solving a governing equation in each generalized\nspace, the shape and size of the SPH kernel can be spatially changed in the\nphysical space so that a spatial resolution is adaptively varied a priori\ndepending on the deformation characteristics, and thus, a low-cost calculation\nwith the less number of particles is achieved in complex shape structures.",

Hypotheses associated with the research model are tested using a\ndataset that contains responses from 299 CIOs, IT managers, and lead\narchitects. Results show that dynamic enterprise architecture capabilities\npositively influence the firm's process innovation and business/IT alignment.\nThese mediating forces are both positively associated with organizational\nbenefits.

In this paper, we study the problem of how to imitate tasks when\nthere exist discrepancies between the expert and agent MDP. These discrepancies\nacross domains could include differing dynamics, viewpoint, or morphology; we\npresent a novel framework to learn correspondences across such domains.\nImportantly, in contrast to prior works, we use unpaired and unaligned\ntrajectories containing only states in the expert domain, to learn this\ncorrespondence. We utilize a cycle-consistency constraint on both the state\nspace and a domain agnostic latent space to do this. In addition, we enforce\nconsistency on the temporal position of states via a normalized position\nestimator function, to align the trajectories across the two domains.

Compared to the conventional tandem-based approach that\ncombines speech recognition and language understanding as separate modules, the\nnew approach extracts users' intentions directly from the speech signals,\nresulting in joint optimization and low latency. Such an approach, however, is\ntypically designed to process one intention at a time, which leads users to\ntake multiple rounds to fulfill their requirements while interacting with a\ndialogue system. In this paper, we propose a streaming end-to-end framework\nthat can process multiple intentions in an online and incremental way. The\nbackbone of our framework is a unidirectional RNN trained with the\nconnectionist temporal classification (CTC) criterion. By this design, an\nintention can be identified when sufficient evidence has been accumulated, and\nmultiple intentions can be identified sequentially. We evaluate our solution on\nthe Fluent Speech Commands (FSC) dataset and the intent detection accuracy is\nabout 97 % on all multi-intent settings. This result is comparable to the\nperformance of the state-of-the-art non-streaming models, but is achieved in an\nonline and incremental way.

    "abstract": "Massive amounts of data are expected to be generated by the billions of\nobjects that form the Internet of Things (IoT). A variety of automated services\nsuch as monitoring will largely depend on the use of different Machine Learning\n(ML) algorithms. Traditionally, ML models are processed by centralized cloud\ndata centers, where IoT readings are offloaded to the cloud via multiple\nnetworking hops in the access, metro, and core layers. This approach will\ninevitably lead to excessive networking power consumptions as well as\nQuality-of-Service (QoS) degradation such as increased latency. Instead, in\nthis paper, we propose a distributed ML approach where the processing can take\nplace in intermediary devices such as IoT nodes and fog servers in addition to\nthe cloud. We abstract the ML models into Virtual Service Requests (VSRs) to\nrepresent multiple interconnected layers of a Deep Neural Network (DNN). Using\nMixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), we design an optimization model that\nallocates the layers of a DNN in a Cloud/Fog Network (CFN) in an energy\nefficient way. We evaluate the impact of DNN input distribution on the\nperformance of the CFN and compare the energy efficiency of this approach to\nthe baseline where all layers of DNNs are processed in the centralized Cloud\nData Center (CDC).",

    "abstract": "To make a modular robotic system both capable and scalable, the controller\nmust be equally as modular as the mechanism. Given the large number of designs\nthat can be generated from even a small set of modules, it becomes impractical\nto create a new system-wide controller for each design. Instead, we construct a\nmodular control policy that handles a broad class of designs. We take the view\nthat a module is both form and function, i.e. both mechanism and controller. As\nthe modules are physically re-configured, the policy automatically\nre-configures to match the kinematic structure. This novel policy is trained\nwith a new model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, which interleaves\nmodel learning and trajectory optimization to guide policy learning for\nmultiple designs simultaneously. Training the policy on a varied set of designs\nteaches it how to adapt its behavior to the design. We show that the policy can\nthen generalize to a larger set of designs not seen during training. We\ndemonstrate one policy controlling many designs with different combinations of\nlegs and wheels to locomote both in simulation and on real robots.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has successfully demonstrated new types of data poisoning\nattacks. To address this problem, some researchers have proposed both offline\nand online data poisoning detection defenses which employ machine learning\nalgorithms to identify such attacks. In this work, we take a different approach\nto preventing data poisoning attacks which relies on cryptographically-based\nauthentication and provenance to ensure the integrity of the data used to train\na machine learning model. The same approach is also used to prevent software\npoisoning and model poisoning attacks. A software poisoning attack maliciously\nalters one or more software components used to train a model. Once the model\nhas been trained it can also be protected against model poisoning attacks which\nseek to alter a model's predictions by modifying its underlying parameters or\nstructure. Finally, an evaluation set or test set can also be protected to\nprovide evidence if they have been modified by a second data poisoning attack.\nTo achieve these goals, we propose VAMP which extends the previously proposed\nAMP system, that was designed to protect media objects such as images, video\nfiles or audio clips, to the machine learning setting. We first provide\nrequirements for authentication and provenance for a secure machine learning\nsystem. Next, we demonstrate how VAMP's manifest meets these requirements to\nprotect a machine learning system's datasets, software components, and models.",

Knowledge Distillation has recently emerged to tackle this issue, by\nrefining the server model using aggregated knowledge from heterogeneous users,\nother than directly averaging their model parameters.

    "abstract": "Research in Cognitive Science suggests that humans understand and represent\nknowledge of the world through causal relationships. In addition to\nobservations, they can rely on experimenting and counterfactual reasoning --\ni.e. referring to an alternative course of events -- to identify causal\nrelations and explain atypical situations. Different instances of control\nsystems, such as smart homes, would benefit from having a similar causal model,\nas it would help the user understand the logic of the system and better react\nwhen needed. However, while data-driven methods achieve high levels of\ncorrelation detection, they mainly fall short of finding causal relations,\nnotably being limited to observations only. Notably, they struggle to identify\nthe cause from the effect when detecting a correlation between two variables.\nThis paper introduces a new way to learn causal models from a mixture of\nexperiments on the environment and observational data. The core of our method\nis the use of selected interventions, especially our learning takes into\naccount the variables where it is impossible to intervene, unlike other\napproaches. The causal model we obtain is then used to generate Causal Bayesian\nNetworks, which can be later used to perform diagnostic and predictive\ninference. We use our method on a smart home simulation, a use case where\nknowing causal relations pave the way towards explainable systems. Our\nalgorithm succeeds in generating a Causal Bayesian Network close to the\nsimulation's ground truth causal interactions, showing encouraging prospects\nfor application in real-life systems.",

Our work builds upon generative adversarial\nnetworks (GAN) and reinforcement learning, and introduces an imitation learning\nframework where an ensemble of classifiers and an imitation policy are trained\nin tandem given pre-processed reference clips. The classifiers are trained to\ndiscriminate the reference motion from the motion generated by the imitation\npolicy, while the policy is rewarded for fooling the discriminators. Using our\nGAN-based approach, multiple motor control policies can be trained separately\nto imitate different behaviors. In runtime, our system can respond to external\ncontrol signal provided by the user and interactively switch between different\npolicies. Compared to existing methods, our proposed approach has the following\nattractive properties: 1) achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance\nwithout manually designing and fine tuning a reward function; 2) directly\ncontrols the character without having to track any target reference pose\nexplicitly or implicitly through a phase state; and 3) supports interactive\npolicy switching without requiring any motion generation or motion matching\nmechanism.

    "abstract": "Users' clicks on Web search results are one of the key signals for evaluating\nand improving web search quality and have been widely used as part of current\nstate-of-the-art Learning-To-Rank(LTR) models. With a large volume of search\nlogs available for major search engines, effective models of searcher click\nbehavior have emerged to evaluate and train LTR models. However, when modeling\nthe users' click behavior, considering the bias of the behavior is imperative.\nIn particular, when a search result is not clicked, it is not necessarily\nchosen as not relevant by the user, but instead could have been simply missed,\nespecially for lower-ranked results. These kinds of biases in the click log\ndata can be incorporated into the click models, propagating the errors to the\nresulting LTR ranking models or evaluation metrics. In this paper, we propose\nthe De-biased Reinforcement Learning Click model (DRLC). The DRLC model relaxes\npreviously made assumptions about the users' examination behavior and resulting\nlatent states. To implement the DRLC model, convolutional neural networks are\nused as the value networks for reinforcement learning, trained to learn a\npolicy to reduce bias in the click logs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe DRLC model, we first compare performance with the previous state-of-art\napproaches using established click prediction metrics, including log-likelihood\nand perplexity. We further show that DRLC also leads to improvements in ranking\nperformance. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRLC model in\nlearning to reduce bias in click logs, leading to improved modeling performance\nand showing the potential for using DRLC for improving Web search quality.",

Recent studies have shown\nthat token labels can convey crucial task-specific information and enrich token\nsemantics. However, as far as we know, due to completely abstain from sequence\ntagging mechanism, all prior span-based work fails to use token label\nin-formation. To solve this problem, we pro-pose Sequence Tagging enhanced\nSpan-based Network (STSN), a span-based joint extrac-tion network that is\nenhanced by token BIO label information derived from sequence tag-ging based\nNER.

    "title": "An interpretable object detection based model for the diagnosis of  neonatal lung diseases using Ultrasound images",
    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, Lung Ultrasound (LUS) has been increasingly used\nto diagnose and monitor different lung diseases in neonates. It is a non\ninvasive tool that allows a fast bedside examination while minimally handling\nthe neonate. Acquiring a LUS scan is easy, but understanding the artifacts\nconcerned with each respiratory disease is challenging. Mixed artifact patterns\nfound in different respiratory diseases may limit LUS readability by the\noperator. While machine learning (ML), especially deep learning can assist in\nautomated analysis, simply feeding the ultrasound images to an ML model for\ndiagnosis is not enough to earn the trust of medical professionals. The\nalgorithm should output LUS features that are familiar to the operator instead.\nTherefore, in this paper we present a unique approach for extracting seven\nmeaningful LUS features that can be easily associated with a specific\npathological lung condition: Normal pleura, irregular pleura, thick pleura,\nAlines, Coalescent B-lines, Separate B-lines and Consolidations. These\nartifacts can lead to early prediction of infants developing later respiratory\ndistress symptoms. A single multi-class region proposal-based object detection\nmodel faster-RCNN (fRCNN) was trained on lower posterior lung ultrasound videos\nto detect these LUS features which are further linked to four common neonatal\ndiseases. Our results show that fRCNN surpasses single stage models such as\nRetinaNet and can successfully detect the aforementioned LUS features with a\nmean average precision of 86.4%. Instead of a fully automatic diagnosis from\nimages without any interpretability, detection of such LUS features leave the\nultimate control of diagnosis to the clinician, which can result in a more\ntrustworthy intelligent system.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale unlabeled data has allowed recent progress in self-supervised\nlearning methods that learn rich visual representations. State-of-the-art\nself-supervised methods for learning representations from images (MoCo and\nBYOL) use an inductive bias that different augmentations (e.g. random crops) of\nan image should produce similar embeddings. We show that such methods are\nvulnerable to backdoor attacks where an attacker poisons a part of the\nunlabeled data by adding a small trigger (known to the attacker) to the images.\nThe model performance is good on clean test images but the attacker can\nmanipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger at test time.\nBackdoor attacks have been studied extensively in supervised learning and to\nthe best of our knowledge, we are the first to study them for self-supervised\nlearning. Backdoor attacks are more practical in self-supervised learning since\nthe unlabeled data is large and as a result, an inspection of the data to avoid\nthe presence of poisoned data is prohibitive. We show that in our targeted\nattack, the attacker can produce many false positives for the target category\nby using the trigger at test time. We also propose a knowledge distillation\nbased defense algorithm that succeeds in neutralizing the attack. Our code is\navailable here: https://github.com/UMBCvision/SSL-Backdoor .",

    "abstract": "To support complex search tasks, where the initial information requirements\nare complex or may change during the search, a search engine must adapt the\ninformation delivery as the user's information requirements evolve. To support\nthis dynamic ranking paradigm effectively, search result ranking must\nincorporate both the user feedback received, and the information displayed so\nfar. To address this problem, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based\napproach, RLIrank. We first build an adapted reinforcement learning framework\nto integrate the key components of the dynamic search. Then, we implement a new\nLearning to Rank (LTR) model for each iteration of the dynamic search, using a\nrecurrent Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM), which estimates the\ngain for each next result, learning from each previously ranked document. To\nincorporate the user's feedback, we develop a word-embedding variation of the\nclassic Rocchio Algorithm, to help guide the ranking towards the high-value\ndocuments. Those innovations enable RLIrank to outperform the previously\nreported methods from the TREC Dynamic Domain Tracks 2017 and exceed all the\nmethods in 2016 TREC Dynamic Domain after multiple search iterations, advancing\nthe state of the art for dynamic search.",

Hence, direct minimization of the Bellman error can\nresult in significantly biased Q-function estimates. We explain why fixing the\ntarget Q-network in Deep Q-Networks and Fitted Q Evaluation provides a way of\novercoming this confounding, thus shedding new light on this popular but not\nwell understood trick in the deep RL literature. An alternative approach to\naddress confounding is to leverage techniques developed in the causality\nliterature, notably instrumental variables (IV).

This paper analyzes and compares a wide range of\nrecent IV methods in the context of offline policy evaluation (OPE), where the\ngoal is to estimate the value of a policy using logged data only.

    "abstract": "Code changes constitute one of the most important features of software\nevolution. Studying them can provide insights into the nature of software\ndevelopment and also lead to practical solutions - recommendations and\nautomations of popular changes for developers.\nIn our work, we developed a tool called PythonChangeMiner that allows to\ndiscover code change patterns in the histories of Python projects. We validated\nthe tool and then employed it to discover patterns in the dataset of 120\nprojects from four different domains of software engineering. We manually\ncategorized patterns that occur in more than one project from the standpoint of\ntheir structure and content, and compared different domains and patterns in\nthat regard. We conducted a survey of the authors of the discovered changes:\n82.9% of them said that they can give the change a name and 57.9% expressed\ntheir desire to have the changes automated, indicating the ability of the tool\nto discover valuable patterns. Finally, we interviewed 9 members of a popular\nintegrated development environment (IDE) development team to estimate the\nfeasibility of automating the discovered changes. It was revealed that\nindependence from the context and high precision made a pattern a better\ncandidate for automation. The patterns received mainly positive reviews and\nseveral were ranked as very likely for automation.",

    "abstract": "Distantly supervision automatically generates plenty of training samples for\nrelation extraction. However, it also incurs two major problems: noisy labels\nand imbalanced training data. Previous works focus more on reducing wrongly\nlabeled relations (false positives) while few explore the missing relations\nthat are caused by incompleteness of knowledge base (false negatives).\nFurthermore, the quantity of negative labels overwhelmingly surpasses the\npositive ones in previous problem formulations. In this paper, we first provide\na thorough analysis of the above challenges caused by negative data. Next, we\nformulate the problem of relation extraction into as a positive unlabeled\nlearning task to alleviate false negative problem.

The complementary effect of multi-view mammogram\nimages provides valuable information about the breast anatomical prior\nstructure and is of great significance in digital mammography interpretation.\nHowever, unlike radiologists who can utilize the natural reasoning ability to\nidentify masses based on multiple mammographic views, how to endow the existing\nobject detection models with the capability of multi-view reasoning is vital\nfor decision-making in clinical diagnosis but remains the boundary to explore.\nIn this paper, we propose an Anatomy-aware Graph convolutional Network (AGN),\nwhich is tailored for mammogram mass detection and endows existing detection\nmethods with multi-view reasoning ability. The proposed AGN consists of three\nsteps. Firstly, we introduce a Bipartite Graph convolutional Network (BGN) to\nmodel the intrinsic geometric and semantic relations of ipsilateral views.\nSecondly, considering that the visual asymmetry of bilateral views is widely\nadopted in clinical practice to assist the diagnosis of breast lesions, we\npropose an Inception Graph convolutional Network (IGN) to model the structural\nsimilarities of bilateral views. Finally, based on the constructed graphs, the\nmulti-view information is propagated through nodes methodically, which equips\nthe features learned from the examined view with multi-view reasoning ability.\nExperiments on two standard benchmarks reveal that AGN significantly exceeds\nthe state-of-the-art performance.

Recently, with the growing diversity of systems to\nbe reasoned about (probabilistic, cyber-physical, etc.), the focus shifted to\nquantitative settings which resulted in a number of expressivity results for\nquantitative logics and behavioral metrics. Each of these quantitative\nexpressivity results uses a tailor-made argument; distilling the essence of\nthese arguments is non-trivial, yet important to support the design of\nexpressive modal logics for new quantitative settings. In this paper, we\npresent the first categorical framework for deriving quantitative expressivity\nresults, based on the new notion of approximating family.

While very\neffective on benchmark domains, this approach does not scale well when solving\nreal-world problems that require long plans. We propose a set of techniques\nthat allow the planner to compute LP consistency checks lazily where possible,\nsignificantly reducing the computation time required, thus allowing the planner\nto solve larger problem instances within an acceptable time-frame. We also\npropose an algorithm to perform duration-dependent goal checking more\nselectively. Furthermore, we propose an LP formulation with a smaller footprint\nthat removes linearity restrictions on discrete effects applied within segments\nof the plan where a numeric fluent is not duration dependent. The effectiveness\nof these techniques is demonstrated on domains that use a mix of discrete and\ncontinuous effects, which is typical of real-world planning problems.

The first threshold represents the willingness of an agent to adopt\nan opinion if the agent has no opinion at all, while the second threshold\nstates for willingness to acquire second opinion. The goal is to add as few\nagents as possible to the initial seed-sets such that, once the process started\nwith these seed-sets stabilizes, each agent has either both opinions or none.\nWe show that the problem is NP-hard. Further, we investigate the complexity\nfrom the parameterized point-of-view. The problem is W[1]-hard with respect to\nthe solution size. The problem remains W[1]-hard even for the combination of\nparameters the solution size and treewidth of the network even if all\nthresholds are at most 3, or the activation process stabilizes within 4 rounds.\nOn the other hand, the problem is FPT when parameterized by the number of\nrounds, maximum threshold, and treewidth.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained using stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD)-based optimizers. Recently, the adaptive moment estimation (Adam)\noptimizer has become very popular due to its adaptive momentum, which tackles\nthe dying gradient problem of SGD. Nevertheless, existing optimizers are still\nunable to exploit the optimization curvature information efficiently. This\npaper proposes a new AngularGrad optimizer that considers the behavior of the\ndirection/angle of consecutive gradients. This is the first attempt in the\nliterature to exploit the gradient angular information apart from its\nmagnitude. The proposed AngularGrad generates a score to control the step size\nbased on the gradient angular information of previous iterations. Thus, the\noptimization steps become smoother as a more accurate step size of immediate\npast gradients is captured through the angular information. Two variants of\nAngularGrad are developed based on the use of Tangent or Cosine functions for\ncomputing the gradient angular information. Theoretically, AngularGrad exhibits\nthe same regret bound as Adam for convergence purposes. Nevertheless, extensive\nexperiments conducted on benchmark data sets against state-of-the-art methods\nreveal a superior performance of AngularGrad.

    "title": "Aligning Visual Prototypes with BERT Embeddings for Few-Shot Learning",
    "abstract": "Few-shot learning (FSL) is the task of learning to recognize previously\nunseen categories of images from a small number of training examples. This is a\nchallenging task, as the available examples may not be enough to unambiguously\ndetermine which visual features are most characteristic of the considered\ncategories. To alleviate this issue, we propose a method that additionally\ntakes into account the names of the image classes. While the use of class names\nhas already been explored in previous work, our approach differs in two key\naspects. First, while previous work has aimed to directly predict visual\nprototypes from word embeddings, we found that better results can be obtained\nby treating visual and text-based prototypes separately. Second, we propose a\nsimple strategy for learning class name embeddings using the BERT language\nmodel, which we found to substantially outperform the GloVe vectors that were\nused in previous work. We furthermore propose a strategy for dealing with the\nhigh dimensionality of these vectors, inspired by models for aligning\ncross-lingual word embeddings. We provide experiments on miniImageNet, CUB and\ntieredImageNet, showing that our approach consistently improves the\nstate-of-the-art in metric-based FSL.",

    "abstract": "As remote sensing (RS) data obtained from different sensors become available\nlargely and openly, multimodal data processing and analysis techniques have\nbeen garnering increasing interest in the RS and geoscience community. However,\ndue to the gap between different modalities in terms of imaging sensors,\nresolutions, and contents, embedding their complementary information into a\nconsistent, compact, accurate, and discriminative representation, to a great\nextent, remains challenging. To this end, we propose a shared and specific\nfeature learning (S2FL) model. S2FL is capable of decomposing multimodal RS\ndata into modality-shared and modality-specific components, enabling the\ninformation blending of multi-modalities more effectively, particularly for\nheterogeneous data sources. Moreover, to better assess multimodal baselines and\nthe newly-proposed S2FL model, three multimodal RS benchmark datasets, i.e.,\nHouston2013 -- hyperspectral and multispectral data, Berlin -- hyperspectral\nand synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, Augsburg -- hyperspectral, SAR, and\ndigital surface model (DSM) data, are released and used for land cover\nclassification. Extensive experiments conducted on the three datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority and advancement of our S2FL model in the task of\nland cover classification in comparison with previously-proposed\nstate-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, the baseline codes and datasets used\nin this paper will be made available freely at\nhttps://github.com/danfenghong/ISPRS_S2FL.",

Recently, many online methods have emerged to narrow the\nperformance gap between training data (source domain) and test data (target\ndomain) by fine-tuning on annotations of test data which are usually in\nshortage. In this paper, we propose a novel method to tackle domain shift by\nfirst introducing adversarial domain adaptation to the VOS task, with\nsupervised training on the source domain and unsupervised training on the\ntarget domain. By fusing appearance and motion features with a convolution\nlayer, and by adding supervision onto the motion branch, our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on DAVIS2016 with 82.6% mean IoU score after\nsupervised training.

    "abstract": "Hidden features in neural network usually fail to learn informative\nrepresentation for 3D segmentation as supervisions are only given on output\nprediction, while this can be solved by omni-scale supervision on intermediate\nlayers. In this paper, we bring the first omni-scale supervision method to\npoint cloud segmentation via the proposed gradual Receptive Field Component\nReasoning (RFCR), where target Receptive Field Component Codes (RFCCs) are\ndesigned to record categories within receptive fields for hidden units in the\nencoder. Then, target RFCCs will supervise the decoder to gradually infer the\nRFCCs in a coarse-to-fine categories reasoning manner, and finally obtain the\nsemantic labels. Because many hidden features are inactive with tiny magnitude\nand make minor contributions to RFCC prediction, we propose a Feature\nDensification with a centrifugal potential to obtain more unambiguous features,\nand it is in effect equivalent to entropy regularization over features. More\nactive features can further unleash the potential of our omni-supervision\nmethod. We embed our method into four prevailing backbones and test on three\nchallenging benchmarks. Our method can significantly improve the backbones in\nall three datasets.

    "abstract": "Demand response (DR) refers to change in electricity consumption pattern of\ncustomers during on-peak hours in lieu of financial gains to reduce stress on\ndistribution systems. Existing dynamic price models have not provided adequate\nsuccess to price-based demand response (PBDR) programs. It happened as these\nmodels have raised typical socio-economic problems pertaining to cross-subsidy,\nfree-riders, social inequity, assured profit of utilities, financial gains and\ncomfort of customers, etc. This paper presents a new dynamic price model for\nPBDR in distribution systems which aims to overcome some of the above mentioned\nproblems of the existing price models. The main aim of the developed price\nmodel is to overcome the problems of cross-subsidy and free-riders of the\nexisting price models for widespread acceptance, deployment and efficient\nutilization of PBDR programs in contemporary distribution systems. Proposed\nprice model generates demand-linked price signal that imposes different price\nsignals to different customers during on-peak hours and remains static\notherwise. This makes proposed model a class apart from other existing models.\nThe novelty of the proposed model lies in the fact that the financial benefits\nand penalties pertaining to DR are self-adjusted among customers while\npreserving social equity and profit of the utility. Such an ideology has not\nbeen yet addressed in the literature. Detailed investigation of application\nresults on a standard test bench reveals that the proposed model equally cares\nregarding the interests of both customers and utility. For economic assessment,\na comparison of the proposed price model with the existing pricing models is\nalso performed.",

Recent developments address this issue through so-called\npredictive safety filters, which assess if a proposed learning-based control\ninput can lead to constraint violations and modifies it if necessary to ensure\nsafety for all future time steps. The theoretical guarantees of such predictive\nsafety filters rely on the model assumptions and minor deviations can lead to\nfailure of the filter putting the system at risk. This paper introduces an\nauxiliary soft-constrained predictive control problem that is always feasible\nat each time step and asymptotically stabilizes the feasible set of the\noriginal safety filter, thereby providing a recovery mechanism in\nsafety-critical situations. This is achieved by a simple constraint tightening\nin combination with a terminal control barrier function. By extending\ndiscrete-time control barrier function theory, we establish that the proposed\nauxiliary problem provides a `predictive' control barrier function. The\nresulting algorithm is demonstrated using numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of time-sensitive applications and services has driven\nenhancements to computing infrastructures. The main challenge that needs\naddressing for these applications is the optimal placement of the end-users\ndemands to reduce the total power consumption and delay. One of the widely\nadopted paradigms to address such a challenge is fog computing. Placing fog\nunits close to end-users at the edge of the network can help mitigate some of\nthe latency and energy efficiency issues. Compared to the traditional\nhyperscale cloud data centres, fog computing units are constrained by\ncomputational power, hence, the capacity of fog units plays a critical role in\nmeeting the stringent demands of the end-users due to intensive processing\nworkloads. In this paper, we aim to optimize the placement of virtual machines\n(VMs) demands originating from end-users in a fog computing setting by\nformulating a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to minimize the\ntotal power consumption through the use of a federated architecture made up of\nmultiple distributed fog cells. The obtained results show an increase in\nprocessing capacity in the fog layer and a reduction in the power consumption\nby up to 26% compared to the Non-Federated fogs network.",

    "abstract": "Many methods have been developed in trajectory planning in order to achieve\nsmooth and accurate motion with considering the constraints of kinematics\nconstraints such as angular position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk. The\nproblem of using the combination of n-order polynomials is that there is no\nideally match between the segments of trajectory path at the via point in terms\nof the number of kinematic constraints. It leads to generate undesirable\ntrajectory path at the via point that connects between two segments of the\ntrajectory path. In this paper, we aim to investigate the effect of increasing\nto higher order polynomial blends on the accuracy of the via points with\nconsidering different kinematics constraints. Based on that, the methodology\nthat was used in this paper is based on the polynomial segment with the higher\npolynomial blend (PSPB). Three techniques implemented which are 4-3-4 PSPB,\n5-4-5 PSPB, and 6-5-6 PSPB. Each technique implemented based on applying\ndifferent kinematic constraints. The three techniques validated using a\nmodeling design in SemiMechanics. According to the methodology, the result\nanalyzed and discussed in terms of angular position, angular velocity, angular\nacceleration, and angular jerk based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and\nAverage Difference Error (ADE). The result shows that RMSE of angular position\nfor 4-3-4 PSPB-1, 4-3-4 PSPB-2, 5-4-5 PSPB-1, 5-4-5 PSPB-2, 6-5-6 PSPB-1, and\n6-5-6 PSPB-2 are 0.4574, 0.0172, 10.9089, 0.1242, 0.6153, and 0.3128 degrees\nrespectively. At the same time, the ADE are 0.0455, 0.0017, 1.0855, 0.0124,\n0.0612, and 0.0311 degrees respectively. Thus, the error is increased obviously\nwhen there is no ideal match at the via point in terms of a number of kinematic\nconstraints.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to create a decision-making agent for\nautonomous driving. However, previous approaches provide only black-box\nsolutions, which do not offer information on how confident the agent is about\nits decisions. An estimate of both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of\nthe agent's decisions is fundamental for real-world applications of autonomous\ndriving. Therefore, this paper introduces the Ensemble Quantile Networks (EQN)\nmethod, which combines distributional RL with an ensemble approach, to obtain a\ncomplete uncertainty estimate. The distribution over returns is estimated by\nlearning its quantile function implicitly, which gives the aleatoric\nuncertainty, whereas an ensemble of agents is trained on bootstrapped data to\nprovide a Bayesian estimation of the epistemic uncertainty. A criterion for\nclassifying which decisions that have an unacceptable uncertainty is also\nintroduced. The results show that the EQN method can balance risk and time\nefficiency in different occluded intersection scenarios, by considering the\nestimated aleatoric uncertainty. Furthermore, it is shown that the trained\nagent can use the epistemic uncertainty information to identify situations that\nthe agent has not been trained for and thereby avoid making unfounded,\npotentially dangerous, decisions outside of the training distribution.",

    "abstract": "In a dialogue system pipeline, a natural language generation (NLG) unit\nconverts the dialogue direction and content to a corresponding natural language\nrealization. A recent trend for dialogue systems is to first pre-train on large\ndatasets and then fine-tune in a supervised manner using datasets annotated\nwith application-specific features. Though novel behaviours can be learned from\ncustom annotation, the required effort severely bounds the quantity of the\ntraining set, and the application-specific nature limits the reuse. In light of\nthe recent success of data-driven approaches, we propose the novel future\nbridging NLG (FBNLG) concept for dialogue systems and simulators. The critical\nstep is for an FBNLG to accept a future user or system utterance to bridge the\npresent context towards. Future bridging enables self supervised training over\nannotation-free datasets, decoupled the training of NLG from the rest of the\nsystem. An FBNLG, pre-trained with massive datasets, is expected to apply in\nclassical or new dialogue scenarios with minimal adaptation effort. We evaluate\na prototype FBNLG to show that future bridging can be a viable approach to a\nuniversal few-shot NLG for task-oriented and chit-chat dialogues.",

Fake\nnews spread has gained attention from researchers due to its vicious nature.\nproliferation of misinformation in all media, from the internet to cable news,\npaid advertising and local news outlets, has made it essential for people to\nidentify the misinformation and sort through the facts. Researchers are trying\nto analyze the credibility of information and curtail false information on such\nplatforms. Credibility is the believability of the piece of information at\nhand.

Our\nobjective is to maximize energy efficiency and minimize the average delay on\nall services by allocating the limited radio and NFV resources. In addition,\ndue to the traffic conditions and mobility of users, we let some Virtual\nNetwork Functions (VNFs) to migrate from their current locations to other\nlocations to satisfy the Quality of Service requirements. We formulate our\nproblem to find near-optimal locations of UAVs, transmit power, subcarrier\nassignment, placement, and scheduling the requested service's functions over\nthe UAVs and perform suitable VNF migration. Then we propose a novel\nHierarchical Hybrid Continuous and Discrete Action (HHCDA) deep reinforcement\nlearning method to solve our problem. Finally, the convergence and\ncomputational complexity of the proposed algorithm and its performance analyzed\nfor different parameters. Simulation results show that our proposed HHCDA\nmethod decreases the request reject rate and average delay by 31.5% and 20% and\nincreases the energy efficiency by 40% compared to DDPG method.",

While\nrecent Deep Learning-based solutions achieve satisfactory performance, their\nhigh computational cost renders their application in real-life settings in\nwhich computations need to be performed on embedded platforms intractable. In\nthis paper, we analyze the efficiency of two popular voxel-based 3D object\ndetection methods providing a good compromise between high performance and\nspeed based on two aspects, their ability to detect objects located at large\ndistances from the agent and their ability to operate in real time on embedded\nplatforms equipped with high-performance GPUs.

Moreover, models trained on near objects\nachieve similar or better performance compared to those trained on all objects\nin the scene. This means that the models learn object appearance\nrepresentations mostly from near objects. Our findings suggest that a\nconsiderable part of the computations of existing methods is focused on\nlocations of the scene that do not contribute with successful detection.

    "abstract": "Personalized conversation models (PCMs) generate responses according to\nspeaker preferences. Existing personalized conversation tasks typically require\nmodels to extract speaker preferences from user descriptions or their\nconversation histories, which are scarce for newcomers and inactive users. In\nthis paper, we propose a few-shot personalized conversation task with an\nauxiliary social network. The task requires models to generate personalized\nresponses for a speaker given a few conversations from the speaker and a social\nnetwork. Existing methods are mainly designed to incorporate descriptions or\nconversation histories. Those methods can hardly model speakers with so few\nconversations or connections between speakers. To better cater for newcomers\nwith few resources, we propose a personalized conversation model (PCM) that\nlearns to adapt to new speakers as well as enabling new speakers to learn from\nresource-rich speakers. Particularly, based on a meta-learning based PCM, we\npropose a task aggregator (TA) to collect other speakers' information from the\nsocial network. The TA provides prior knowledge of the new speaker in its\nmeta-learning. Experimental results show our methods outperform all baselines\nin appropriateness, diversity, and consistency with speakers.",

    "abstract": "The need for accurate yield estimates for viticulture is becoming more\nimportant due to increasing competition in the wine market worldwide. One of\nthe most promising methods to estimate the harvest is berry counting, as it can\nbe approached non-destructively, and its process can be automated. In this\narticle, we present a method that addresses the challenge of occluded berries\nwith leaves to obtain a more accurate estimate of the number of berries that\nwill enable a better estimate of the harvest. We use generative adversarial\nnetworks, a deep learning-based approach that generates a likely scenario\nbehind the leaves exploiting learned patterns from images with non-occluded\nberries. Our experiments show that the estimate of the number of berries after\napplying our method is closer to the manually counted reference. In contrast to\napplying a factor to the berry count, our approach better adapts to local\nconditions by directly involving the appearance of the visible berries.\nFurthermore, we show that our approach can identify which areas in the image\nshould be changed by adding new berries without explicitly requiring\ninformation about hidden areas.",

Based on this abstract representation, the WNOS takes network\ncontrol programs written on a centralized, high-level view of the network and\nautomatically generates distributed cross-layer control programs based on\ndistributed optimization theory that are executed by each individual node on an\nabstract representation of the radio hardware.

Finally, we illustrate a prototype\nimplementation of WNOS on software-defined radio devices and test its\neffectiveness by considering specific cross-layer control problems.\nExperimental results indicate that, based on the automatically generated\ndistributed control programs, WNOS achieves 18%, 56% and 80.4% utility gain in\nnetworks with low, medium and high levels of interference; maybe more\nimportantly, we illustrate how the global network behavior can be controlled by\nmodifying a few lines of code on a centralized abstraction.",

In this\nstudy, we implemented and tested the swept rule for solving two-dimensional\nproblems on heterogeneous computing systems across two distinct systems.

    "title": "Fact-driven Logical Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Logical reasoning, which is closely related to human cognition, is of vital\nimportance in human's understanding of texts. Recent years have witnessed\nincreasing attentions on machine's logical reasoning abilities. However,\nprevious studies commonly apply ad-hoc methods to model pre-defined relation\npatterns, such as linking named entities, which only considers global knowledge\ncomponents that are related to commonsense, without local perception of\ncomplete facts or events. Such methodology is obviously insufficient to deal\nwith complicated logical structures. Therefore, we argue that the natural logic\nunits would be the group of backbone constituents of the sentence such as the\nsubject-verb-object formed \"facts\", covering both global and local knowledge\npieces that are necessary as the basis for logical reasoning. Beyond building\nthe ad-hoc graphs, we propose a more general and convenient fact-driven\napproach to construct a supergraph on top of our newly defined fact units, and\nenhance the supergraph with further explicit guidance of local question and\noption interactions. Experiments on two challenging logical reasoning benchmark\ndatasets, ReClor and LogiQA, show that our proposed model, \\textsc{Focal\nReasoner}, outperforms the baseline models dramatically. It can also be\nsmoothly applied to other downstream tasks such as MuTual, a dialogue reasoning\ndataset, achieving competitive results.",

The initialization is\ncast as an optimization problem where we minimize a combination of encoding and\ndecoding losses of the input activations, which is further constrained by a\nuser-defined latent code. The optimization problem is then restructured into\nthe well-known Sylvester equation, which has fast and efficient gradient-free\nsolutions. Our data-driven method achieves a boost in performance compared to\nrandom initialization methods, both before start of training and after training\nis over.

To address this issue, domain\nadaptation (DA) is one solution and many unsupervised DA methods have been\nproposed. These methods focus on a scenario of single source domain to single\ntarget domain. However, we will face such problem that test data comes from\nmultiple target domains. This problem can be addressed by producing one model\nper target domain, but this solution is too costly. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel unsupervised multi-target domain adaption (MTDA) method for ASC, which\ncan adapt to multiple target domains simultaneously and make use of the\nunderlying relation among multiple domains. Specifically, our approach combines\ntraditional adversarial adaptation with two novel discriminator tasks that\nlearns a common subspace shared by all domains. Furthermore, we propose to\ndivide the target domain into the easy-to-adapt and hard-to-adapt domain, which\nenables the system to pay more attention to hard-to-adapt domain in training.\nThe experimental results on the DCASE 2020 Task 1-A dataset and the DCASE 2019\nTask 1-B dataset show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the\nprevious unsupervised DA methods.",

    "abstract": "Face recognition has achieved significant progress in deep-learning era due\nto the ultra-large-scale and well-labeled datasets. However, training on\nultra-large-scale datasets is time-consuming and takes up a lot of hardware\nresource. Therefore, how to design an appropriate training approach is very\ncrucial and indispensable. The computational and hardware cost of training\nultra-large-scale datasets mainly focuses on the Fully-Connected (FC) layer\nrather than convolutional layers. To this end, we propose a novel training\napproach for ultra-large-scale face datasets, termed Faster Face Classification\n(F$^2$C). In F$^2$C, we first define a Gallery Net and a Probe Net that are\nused to generate identities' centers and extract faces' features for face\nrecognition, respectively. Gallery Net has the same structure as Probe Net and\ninherits the parameters from Probe Net with a moving average paradigm. After\nthat, to reduce the training time and hardware resource occupancy of the FC\nlayer, we propose the Dynamic Class Pool that stores the features from Gallery\nNet and calculates the inner product (logits) with positive samples (its\nidentities appear in Dynamic Class Pool) in each mini-batch. Dynamic Class Pool\ncan be regarded as a substitute for the FC layer and its size is much smaller\nthan FC, which is the reason why Dynamic Class Pool can largely reduce the time\nand resource cost. For negative samples (its identities are not appear in the\nDynamic Class Pool), we minimize the cosine similarities between negative\nsamples and Dynamic Class Pool. Then, to improve the update efficiency and\nspeed of Dynamic Class Pool's parameters, we design the Dual Loaders including\nIdentity-based and Instance-based Loaders. Dual Loaders load images from given\ndataset by instances and identities to generate batches for training.",

In particular,\nthere is a strong interest in exploring the possibilities in performing\nconvolution on graphs using an extension of the GNN architecture, generally\nreferred to as Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN). Convolution on\ngraphs has been achieved mainly in two forms: spectral and spatial\nconvolutions. Due to the higher flexibility in exploring and exploiting the\ngraph structure of data, recently, there is an increasing interest in\ninvestigating the possibilities that the spatial approach can offer. The idea\nof finding a way to adapt the network behaviour to the inputs they process to\nmaximize the total performances has aroused much interest in the neural\nnetworks literature over the years. This paper presents a novel method to adapt\nthe behaviour of a GCNN to the input proposing two ways to perform spatial\nconvolution on graphs using input-based filters which are dynamically\ngenerated. Our model also investigates the problem of discovering and refining\nrelations among nodes. The experimental assessment confirms the capabilities of\nthe proposed approach, which achieves satisfying results using simple\narchitectures with a low number of filters.",

As more and more CPS adopt Deep Neural Networks (Deep\nNeural Network (dnns), these systems can be vulnerable to attacks. . Prior work\nhas demonstrated the susceptibility of CPS to False Data Injection Attacks\n(False Data Injection Attacks (fdias), which can cause significant damage. We\nidentify a new category of attacks on these systems. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that DNN based CPS are also subject to these attacks. These\nattacks, which we call Ripple False Data Injection Attacks (rfdia), use minimal\ninput perturbations to stealthily change the dnn output. The input\nperturbations propagate as ripples through multiple dnn layers to affect the\noutput in a targeted manner. We develop an automated technique to synthesize\nrfdias against DNN-based CPS. Our technique models the attack as an\noptimization problem using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (Mixed Integer\nLinear Program (milp)). We define an abstraction for dnnbased cps that allows\nus to automatically: 1) identify the critical inputs, and 2) find the smallest\nperturbations that produce output changes.

This paper\nprovides a comprehensive description of a novel learning framework that allows\nfield and service robots to interpret and correctly execute natural language\ninstructions in a priori unknown, unstructured environments. Integral to our\napproach is its use of language as a \"sensor\" -- inferring spatial,\ntopological, and semantic information implicit in natural language utterances\nand then exploiting this information to learn a distribution over a latent\nenvironment model. We incorporate this distribution in a probabilistic language\ngrounding model and infer a distribution over a symbolic representation of the\nrobot's action space. We use imitation learning to identify a belief space\npolicy that reasons over the environment and behavior distributions. We\nevaluate our framework through a variety of different navigation and mobile\nmanipulation experiments.",

Three\ndifferent word-level text highlighting methodologies are implemented and\nevaluated. The first method uses TF-IDF scores directly to highlight important\nparts of the text.

    "abstract": "In empirical game-theoretic analysis (EGTA), game models are extended\niteratively through a process of generating new strategies based on learning\nfrom experience with prior strategies. The strategy exploration problem in EGTA\nis how to direct this process so to construct effective models with minimal\niteration. A variety of approaches have been proposed in the literature,\nincluding methods based on classic techniques and novel concepts. Comparing the\nperformance of these alternatives can be surprisingly subtle, depending\nsensitively on criteria adopted and measures employed. We investigate some of\nthe methodological considerations in evaluating strategy exploration, defining\nkey distinctions and identifying a few general principles based on examples and\nexperimental observations. In particular, we emphasize the fact that empirical\ngames create a space of strategies that should be evaluated as a whole. Based\non this fact, we suggest that the minimum regret constrained profile (MRCP)\nprovides a particularly robust basis for evaluating a space of strategies, and\npropose a local search method for MRCP that outperforms previous approaches.\nHowever, the computation of MRCP is not always feasible especially in large\ngames. In this scenario, we highlight consistency considerations for comparing\nacross different approaches. Surprisingly, we find that recent works violate\nthese considerations that are necessary for evaluation, which may result in\nmisleading conclusions on the performance of different approaches.

    "abstract": "A classical question in economics is whether complex, randomized selling\nprotocols can improve a firm's revenue beyond that of simple,\ntake-it-or-leave-it posted prices. In 1981, Myerson answered this question with\nan emphatic \"No\" for a monopolist selling a single product. By contrast, there\nis no crisp answer for multiple products, and a major focus of Bayesian\nmechanism design has been understanding the increase in revenue from pricing\nlotteries over products instead of deterministic products, under different\nclasses of valuation functions and different families of prior customer\ndistributions.\nIn this paper, we ask the same question for assortment optimization, where\nproducts have exogenously-fixed prices, and the decision is on a set of\nsubstitute products to offer. To formalize such a question, we introduce a\nBayesian mechanism design problem where customers have ordinal preferences for\nproducts with fixed prices, in which assortments correspond to deterministic\nmechanisms. Meanwhile, randomized mechanisms correspond to lotteries whose\npayment is restricted equal the fixed price of the randomly-allocated product,\na significant departure from the lotteries currently studied in Bayesian\nmechanism design.\nWe first show that for general ordinal preference distributions, lotteries\nunder this restriction can still earn higher revenue than any deterministic\nassortment. We then derive a natural sufficient condition on the distribution\nwhich ensures the optimality of assortments. Importantly, this sufficient\ncondition captures common distributions used in the assortment optimization\nliterature, including Multi-Nomial Logit (MNL), Markov Chain choice models,\nTversky's Elimination by Aspects model, and mixtures of any one of these with\nIndependent Demand Models. The takeaway is that unless a firm has a very\nsophisticated model for consumer choice, assortments are optimal.",

In this paper, we generalize the verification variant to the setting\nwhere each agent is equipped with multiple incomplete preference lists: Each\nlist (called a layer) is a ranking of items in a possibly different way\naccording to a different criterion.\nIn particular, we introduce three multi-layer verification problems, each\ncorresponds to an optimality notion that weakens the notion of global\noptimality (that is, pareto optimality in multiple layers) in a different way.\nInformally, the first notion requires that, for each group of agents whose size\nis exactly some input parameter k, the agents in the group will not be able to\ntrade their assigned items among themselves and benefit in at least alpha\nlayers; the second notion is similar, but it concerns all groups of size at\nmost k rather than exactly k; the third notion strengthens these notions by\nrequiring that groups of k agents will not be part of possibly larger groups\nthat benefit in at least alpha layers. We study the three problems from the\nperspective of parameterized complexity under several natural parameterizations\nsuch as the number of layers, the number of agents, the number of items, the\nnumber of allocated items, the maximum length of a preference list, and more.\nWe present an almost comprehensive picture of the parameterized complexity of\nthe problems with respect to these parameters.",

Specifically, any spatial convolution layer of the\nCNN can be replaced by two successive convolution layers: the first is a set of\nthree-dimensional orthonormal basis filters, followed by a layer of\none-dimensional filters that represents the original spatial filters in the\nbasis space. We jointly fine-tune both the basis and the filter representation\nto directly mitigate any performance loss due to the truncation.

Our model is a conditional variational autoencoder that can\nbe animated with incomplete driving signals, such as human pose and facial\nkeypoints, and produces a high-quality representation of human geometry and\nview-dependent appearance. The core intuition behind our method is that better\ndrivability and generalization can be achieved by disentangling the driving\nsignals and remaining generative factors, which are not available during\nanimation. To this end, we explicitly account for information deficiency in the\ndriving signal by introducing a latent space that exclusively captures the\nremaining information, thus enabling the imputation of the missing factors\nrequired during full-body animation, while remaining faithful to the driving\nsignal. We also propose a learnable localized compression for the driving\nsignal which promotes better generalization, and helps minimize the influence\nof global chance-correlations often found in real datasets. For a given driving\nsignal, the resulting variational model produces a compact space of uncertainty\nfor missing factors that allows for an imputation strategy best suited to a\nparticular application.

    "abstract": "Modeling powerful interactions is a critical challenge in Click-through rate\n(CTR) prediction, which is one of the most typical machine learning tasks in\npersonalized advertising and recommender systems. Although developing\nhand-crafted interactions is effective for a small number of datasets, it\ngenerally requires laborious and tedious architecture engineering for extensive\nscenarios. In recent years, several neural architecture search (NAS) methods\nhave been proposed for designing interactions automatically. However, existing\nmethods only explore limited types and connections of operators for interaction\ngeneration, leading to low generalization ability. To address these problems,\nwe propose a more general automated method for building powerful interactions\nnamed AutoPI. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: AutoPI\nadopts a more general search space in which the computational graph is\ngeneralized from existing network connections, and the interactive operators in\nthe edges of the graph are extracted from representative hand-crafted works. It\nallows searching for various powerful feature interactions to produce higher\nAUC and lower Logloss in a wide variety of applications. Besides, AutoPI\nutilizes a gradient-based search strategy for exploration with a significantly\nlow computational cost. Experimentally, we evaluate AutoPI on a diverse suite\nof benchmark datasets, demonstrating the generalizability and efficiency of\nAutoPI over hand-crafted architectures and state-of-the-art NAS algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across\nvarious machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head\nself-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image\npatches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such\nflexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can\nfacilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain\nshifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We\nsystematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments\nencompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following\nintriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe\nocclusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1\naccuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content.\n(b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local\ntextures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to\nCNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate\nshape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system,\npreviously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape\nrepresentation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic\nsegmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a\nsingle ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high\naccuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional\nand few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to\nflexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention\nmechanism.",

The difficulty of this problem originates from the\nviewpoint dependent appearance of a transparent object, which quickly makes\nreconstruction methods tailored for diffuse surfaces fail disgracefully. In\nthis paper, we introduce a fixed viewpoint approach to dense surface\nreconstruction of transparent objects based on refraction of light. We present\na simple setup that allows us to alter the incident light paths before light\nrays enter the object by immersing the object partially in a liquid, and\ndevelop a method for recovering the object surface through reconstructing and\ntriangulating such incident light paths. Our proposed approach does not need to\nmodel the complex interactions of light as it travels through the object,\nneither does it assume any parametric form for the object shape nor the exact\nnumber of refractions and reflections taken place along the light paths. It can\ntherefore handle transparent objects with a relatively complex shape and\nstructure, with unknown and inhomogeneous refractive index. We also show that\nfor thin transparent objects, our proposed acquisition setup can be further\nsimplified by adopting a single refraction approximation. Experimental results\non both synthetic and real data demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our\nproposed approach.",

In\nthis way, any CNN architecture can be adapted for non-integer resizing.

While this\nranking step is traditionally performed using heuristics, or by sorting outputs\nproduced by pointwise regression or classification models, Learning to Rank\nalgorithms have recently presented themselves as competitive and viable\nalternatives. Despite improving ranking accuracy on average however, these\ntechniques do not account for the possibility that assets positioned at the\nextreme ends of the ranked list -- which are ultimately used to construct the\nlong/short portfolios -- can assume different distributions in the input space,\nand thus lead to sub-optimal strategy performance. Drawing from research in\nInformation Retrieval that demonstrates the utility of contextual information\nembedded within top-ranked documents to learn the query's characteristics to\nimprove ranking, we propose an analogous approach: exploiting the features of\nboth out- and under-performing instruments to learn a model for refining the\noriginal ranked list. Under a re-ranking framework, we adapt the Transformer\narchitecture to encode the features of extreme assets for refining our\nselection of long/short instruments obtained with an initial retrieval.\nBacktesting on a set of 31 currencies, our proposed methodology significantly\nboosts Sharpe ratios -- by approximately 20% over the original LTR algorithms\nand double that of traditional baselines.",

This work is motivated by the ongoing\nchallenge of computational complexity and optimality in high-dimensional\nnon-convex optimal control. We address these key challenges with the following\napproach. First, we identify a surrogate modeling methodology which takes as\ninput the initial state and a time series of control inputs, and outputs an\napproximation of the objective function and constraint functions. Importantly\nthis approach entirely absorbs the individual state transition dynamics.\nAdditionally, the dependence on the initial state means we can apply\ndimensionality reduction to compress this variable while retaining most of its\ninformation. Uncertainty in the surrogate objective may affect the result\noptimality. Critically, however, uncertainty in the surrogate constraint\nfunctions could lead to infeasibility, i.e. unsafe actions. Therefore, we apply\nWasserstein ambiguity sets to \"robustify\" our surrogate modeling approach\nsubject to worst-case out-of-sample modeling error based on the distribution of\ntest data residuals.

In this paper, we propose a\nDL-based implicit feedback architecture to inherit the low-overhead\ncharacteristic, which uses neural networks (NNs) to replace the precoding\nmatrix indicator (PMI) encoding and decoding modules.

Beyond the alone autoencoder-like architecture, EGU-Net is a\ntwo-stream Siamese deep network, which learns an additional network from the\npure or nearly-pure endmembers to correct the weights of another unmixing\nnetwork by sharing network parameters and adding spectrally meaningful\nconstraints (e.g., non-negativity and sum-to-one) towards a more accurate and\ninterpretable unmixing solution. Furthermore, the resulting general framework\nis not only limited to pixel-wise spectral unmixing but also applicable to\nspatial information modeling with convolutional operators for spatial-spectral\nunmixing. Experimental results conducted on three different datasets with the\nground-truth of abundance maps corresponding to each material demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of the EGU-Net over state-of-the-art unmixing\nalgorithms.

On the other hand, the accuracy of the\nreconstruction is insufficient in many of these methods, so it leads to\ndegraded accuracy of anomaly detection. To improve the accuracy of the\nreconstruction, we consider defining loss function in the frequency domain. In\ngeneral, we know that natural images contain many low-frequency components and\nfew high-frequency components. Hence, to improve the accuracy of the\nreconstruction of high-frequency components, we introduce a new loss function\nnamed weighted frequency domain loss(WFDL).

    "abstract": "Pelvic ring disruptions result from blunt injury mechanisms and are often\nfound in patients with multi-system trauma. To grade pelvic fracture severity\nin trauma victims based on whole-body CT, the Tile AO/OTA classification is\nfrequently used. Due to the high volume of whole-body trauma CTs generated in\nbusy trauma centers, an automated approach to Tile classification would provide\nsubstantial value, e.,g., to prioritize the reading queue of the attending\ntrauma radiologist. In such scenario, an automated method should perform\ngrading based on a transparent process and based on interpretable features to\nenable interaction with human readers and lower their workload by offering\ninsights from a first automated read of the scan. This paper introduces an\nautomated yet interpretable pelvic trauma decision support system to assist\nradiologists in fracture detection and Tile grade classification. The method\noperates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans and first detects\ndistinct pelvic fractures on CT with high specificity using a Faster-RCNN model\nthat are then interpreted using a structural causal model based on clinical\nbest practices to infer an initial Tile grade. The Bayesian causal model and\nfinally, the object detector are then queried for likely co-occurring fractures\nthat may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating\npoint of the detector, resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and\ncorresponding final Tile grade. Our method is transparent in that it provides\nfinding location and type using the object detector, as well as information on\nimportant counterfactuals that would invalidate the system's recommendation and\nachieves an AUC of 83.3%/85.1% for translational/rotational instability.\nDespite being designed for human-machine teaming, our approach does not\ncompromise on performance compared to previous black-box approaches.",

Economical and rapid\ntesting, as well as diagnosis, is urgently needed to control the pandemic. At\npresent, the Covid-19 testing is costly and time-consuming. Chest X-Ray (CXR)\ntesting can be the fastest, scalable, and non-invasive method. The existing\nmethods suffer due to the limited CXR samples available from Covid-19. Thus,\ninspired by the limitations of the open-source work in this field, we propose\nattention guided contrastive CNN architecture (AC-CovidNet) for Covid-19\ndetection in CXR images.

We compute the sensitivity of the proposed method over the\npublicly available Covid-19 dataset.

    "title": "Covariance-Free Sparse Bayesian Learning",
    "abstract": "Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) is a powerful framework for tackling the\nsparse coding problem while also providing uncertainty quantification. However,\nthe most popular inference algorithms for SBL become too expensive for\nhigh-dimensional problems due to the need to maintain a large covariance\nmatrix. To resolve this issue, we introduce a new SBL inference algorithm that\navoids explicit computation of the covariance matrix, thereby saving\nsignificant time and space. Instead of performing costly matrix inversions, our\ncovariance-free method solves multiple linear systems to obtain provably\nunbiased estimates of the posterior statistics needed by SBL. These systems can\nbe solved in parallel, enabling further acceleration of the algorithm via\ngraphics processing units. In practice, our method can be up to thousands of\ntimes faster than existing baselines, reducing hours of computation time to\nseconds. We showcase how our new algorithm enables SBL to tractably tackle\nhigh-dimensional signal recovery problems, such as deconvolution of calcium\nimaging data and multi-contrast reconstruction of magnetic resonance images.\nFinally, we open-source a toolbox containing all of our implementations to\ndrive future research in SBL.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is one of the main diseases affecting men worldwide. The\nGleason scoring system is the primary diagnostic tool for prostate cancer. This\nis obtained via the visual analysis of cancerous patterns in prostate biopsies\nperformed by expert pathologists, and the aggregation of the main Gleason\ngrades in a combined score. Computer-aided diagnosis systems allow to reduce\nthe workload of pathologists and increase the objectivity. Recently, efforts\nhave been made in the literature to develop algorithms aiming the direct\nestimation of the global Gleason score at biopsy/core level with global labels.\nHowever, these algorithms do not cover the accurate localization of the Gleason\npatterns into the tissue. In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based system\nable to detect local cancerous patterns in the prostate tissue using only the\nglobal-level Gleason score during training. The methodological core of this\nwork is the proposed weakly-supervised-trained convolutional neural network,\nWeGleNet, based on a multi-class segmentation layer after the feature\nextraction module, a global-aggregation, and the slicing of the background\nclass for the model loss estimation during training. We obtained a Cohen's\nquadratic kappa (k) of 0.67 for the pixel-level prediction of cancerous\npatterns in the validation cohort. We compared the model performance for\nsemantic segmentation of Gleason grades with supervised state-of-the-art\narchitectures in the test cohort. We obtained a pixel-level k of 0.61 and a\nmacro-averaged f1-score of 0.58, at the same level as fully-supervised methods.\nRegarding the estimation of the core-level Gleason score, we obtained a k of\n0.76 and 0.67 between the model and two different pathologists. WeGleNet is\ncapable of performing the semantic segmentation of Gleason grades similarly to\nfully-supervised methods without requiring pixel-level annotations.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KG) and associated Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models\nhave recently begun to be explored in the context of drug discovery and have\nthe potential to assist in key challenges such as target identification. In the\ndrug discovery domain, KGs can be employed as part of a process which can\nresult in lab-based experiments being performed, or impact on other decisions,\nincurring significant time and financial costs and most importantly, ultimately\ninfluencing patient healthcare. For KGE models to have impact in this domain, a\nbetter understanding of not only of performance, but also the various factors\nwhich determine it, is required.\nIn this study we investigate, over the course of many thousands of\nexperiments, the predictive performance of five KGE models on two public drug\ndiscovery-oriented KGs. Our goal is not to focus on the best overall model or\nconfiguration, instead we take a deeper look at how performance can be affected\nby changes in the training setup, choice of hyperparameters, model parameter\ninitialisation seed and different splits of the datasets. Our results highlight\nthat these factors have significant impact on performance and can even affect\nthe ranking of models. Indeed these factors should be reported along with model\narchitectures to ensure complete reproducibility and fair comparisons of future\nwork, and we argue this is critical for the acceptance of use, and impact of\nKGEs in a biomedical setting.

    "abstract": "The Gleason scoring system is the primary diagnostic and prognostic tool for\nprostate cancer. In recent years, with the development of digitisation devices,\nthe use of computer vision techniques for the analysis of biopsies has\nincreased. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the development of\nalgorithms to automatically detect individual cribriform patterns belonging to\nGleason grade 4 has not yet been studied in the literature. The objective of\nthe work presented in this paper is to develop a deep-learning-based system\nable to support pathologists in the daily analysis of prostate biopsies. The\nmethodological core of this work is a patch-wise predictive model based on\nconvolutional neural networks able to determine the presence of cancerous\npatterns. In particular, we train from scratch a simple self-design\narchitecture. The cribriform pattern is detected by retraining the set of\nfilters of the last convolutional layer in the network. From the reconstructed\nprediction map, we compute the percentage of each Gleason grade in the tissue\nto feed a multi-layer perceptron which provides a biopsy-level score.mIn our\nSICAPv2 database, composed of 182 annotated whole slide images, we obtained a\nCohen's quadratic kappa of 0.77 in the test set for the patch-level Gleason\ngrading with the proposed architecture trained from scratch. Our results\noutperform previous ones reported in the literature. Furthermore, this model\nreaches the level of fine-tuned state-of-the-art architectures in a\npatient-based four groups cross validation. In the cribriform pattern detection\ntask, we obtained an area under ROC curve of 0.82. Regarding the biopsy Gleason\nscoring, we achieved a quadratic Cohen's Kappa of 0.81 in the test subset.\nShallow CNN architectures trained from scratch outperform current\nstate-of-the-art methods for Gleason grades classification.",

In\nparticular, for a single-server queue, as the traffic intensity approaches 1,\nthe policy achieves a scaling for the queue length processes that is similar to\nthe shortest remaining processing time first policy. Our analysis quantifies\nhow the tail of the service time distribution affects the benefits one can gain\nfrom service-time-based scheduling policies. When the service times are\nmisspecified, we further quantify how imperfect observation of the service time\naffects the performance of the two-class priority rule through both theoretical\nand numerical analysis.
