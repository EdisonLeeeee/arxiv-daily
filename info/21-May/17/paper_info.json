    "title": "A Unified Metamodel for NoSQL and Relational Databases",
    "abstract": "The Database field is undergoing significant changes. Although relational\nsystems are still predominant, the interest in NoSQL systems is continuously\nincreasing. In this scenario, polyglot persistence is envisioned as the\ndatabase architecture to be prevalent in the future.\nMulti-model database tools normally use a generic or unified metamodel to\nrepresent schemas of the data model that they support. Such metamodels\nfacilitate developing utilities, as they can be built on a common\nrepresentation. Also, the number of mappings required to migrate databases from\na data model to another is reduced, and integrability is favored.\nIn this paper, we present the U-Schema unified metamodel able to represent\nlogical schemas for the four most popular NoSQL paradigms (columnar, document,\nkey-value, and graph) as well as relational schemas. We will formally define\nthe mappings between U-Schema and the data model defined for each paradigm. How\nthese mappings have been implemented and validated will be discussed, and some\napplications of U-Schema will be shown.\nTo achieve flexibility to respond to data changes, most of NoSQL systems are\n\"schema-on-write,\" and the declaration of schemas is not required. Such an\nabsence of schema declaration makes structural variability possible, i.e.,\nstored data of the same entity type can have different structure. Moreover,\ndata relationships supported by each data model are different. We will show how\nall these issues have been tackled in our approach.\nOur metamodel goes beyond the existing proposals by distinguishing entity\ntypes and relationship types, representing aggregation and reference\nrelationships, and including the notion of structural variability. Our\ncontributions also include developing schema extraction strategies for\nschemaless systems of each NoSQL data model, and tackling performance and\nscalability in the implementation for each store.",

    "abstract": "The recent emergence of deepfake videos leads to an important societal\nquestion: how can we know if a video that we watch is real or fake? In three\nonline studies with 15,016 participants, we present authentic videos and\ndeepfakes and ask participants to identify which is which. We compare the\nperformance of ordinary participants against the leading computer vision\ndeepfake detection model and find them similarly accurate while making\ndifferent kinds of mistakes. Together, participants with access to the model's\nprediction are more accurate than either alone, but inaccurate model\npredictions often decrease participants' accuracy. We embed randomized\nexperiments and find: incidental anger decreases participants' performance and\nobstructing holistic visual processing of faces also hinders participants'\nperformance while mostly not affecting the model's. These results suggest that\nconsidering emotional influences and harnessing specialized, holistic visual\nprocessing of ordinary people could be promising defenses against\nmachine-manipulated media.",

In\nthis paper, we investigate short-packet communications to provide both\nreliability and security guarantees simultaneously with an eavesdropper. In\nparticular, an outage probability considering both reliability and secrecy is\ndefined according to the characteristics of short-packet transmission, while\nthe effective throughput in the sense of outage is established as the\nperformance metric. Specifically, a general analytical framework is proposed to\napproximate the outage probability and effective throughput. Furthermore,\nclosed-form expressions for these quantities are derived for the high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Both effective throughput obtained via a\ngeneral analytical framework and a high-SNR approximation are maximized under\nan outage-probability constraint by searching for the optimal blocklength.\nNumerical results verify the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed\nanalytical framework, and illustrate the influence of the main system\nparameters on the blocklength and system performance under the\noutage-probability constraint.",

    "abstract": "We consider active learning for binary classification in the agnostic\npool-based setting. The vast majority of works in active learning in the\nagnostic setting are inspired by the CAL algorithm where each query is\nuniformly sampled from the disagreement region of the current version space.\nThe sample complexity of such algorithms is described by a quantity known as\nthe disagreement coefficient which captures both the geometry of the hypothesis\nspace as well as the underlying probability space. To date, the disagreement\ncoefficient has been justified by minimax lower bounds only, leaving the door\nopen for superior instance dependent sample complexities. In this work we\npropose an algorithm that, in contrast to uniform sampling over the\ndisagreement region, solves an experimental design problem to determine a\ndistribution over examples from which to request labels. We show that the new\napproach achieves sample complexity bounds that are never worse than the best\ndisagreement coefficient-based bounds, but in specific cases can be\ndramatically smaller. From a practical perspective, the proposed algorithm\nrequires no hyperparameters to tune (e.g., to control the aggressiveness of\nsampling), and is computationally efficient by means of assuming access to an\nempirical risk minimization oracle (without any constraints). Empirically, we\ndemonstrate that our algorithm is superior to state of the art agnostic active\nlearning algorithms on image classification datasets.",

The smart doorbell will be able to\nrecognize the known/unknown person with at most accuracy. The smart doorbell\nsystem is also having additional detection functionalities such as harmful\nweapon detection, noteworthy vehicle detection, animal/pet detection.

Accuracy is initially low when\ncommunicating about concepts with more variable associations, but rapidly\nincreases as participants form ad hoc conventions. Together, our findings\nsuggest that people cope with variability by maintaining well-calibrated\nuncertainty about their partner and appropriately adaptable representations of\ntheir own.",

    "abstract": "Attention mechanisms have shown promising results in sequence modeling tasks\nthat require long-term memory. Recent work investigated mechanisms to reduce\nthe computational cost of preserving and storing memories. However, not all\ncontent in the past is equally important to remember. We propose Expire-Span, a\nmethod that learns to retain the most important information and expire the\nirrelevant information. This forgetting of memories enables Transformers to\nscale to attend over tens of thousands of previous timesteps efficiently, as\nnot all states from previous timesteps are preserved. We demonstrate that\nExpire-Span can help models identify and retain critical information and show\nit can achieve strong performance on reinforcement learning tasks specifically\ndesigned to challenge this functionality. Next, we show that Expire-Span can\nscale to memories that are tens of thousands in size, setting a new state of\nthe art on incredibly long context tasks such as character-level language\nmodeling and a frame-by-frame moving objects task. Finally, we analyze the\nefficiency of Expire-Span compared to existing approaches and demonstrate that\nit trains faster and uses less memory.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are the so-called third generation of neural\nnetworks which attempt to more closely match the functioning of the biological\nbrain. They inherently encode temporal data, allowing for training with less\nenergy usage and can be extremely energy efficient when coded on neuromorphic\nhardware. In addition, they are well suited for tasks involving event-based\nsensors, which match the event-based nature of the SNN. However, SNNs have not\nbeen as effectively applied to real-world, large-scale tasks as standard\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to the algorithmic and training\ncomplexity. To exacerbate the situation further, the input representation is\nunconventional and requires careful analysis and deep understanding. In this\npaper, we propose \\textit{SpikeMS}, the first deep encoder-decoder SNN\narchitecture for the real-world large-scale problem of motion segmentation\nusing the event-based DVS camera as input. To accomplish this, we introduce a\nnovel spatio-temporal loss formulation that includes both spike counts and\nclassification labels in conjunction with the use of new techniques for SNN\nbackpropagation. In addition, we show that \\textit{SpikeMS} is capable of\n\\textit{incremental predictions}, or predictions from smaller amounts of test\ndata than it is trained on. This is invaluable for providing outputs even with\npartial input data for low-latency applications and those requiring fast\npredictions.

The goal of the robot is to safely collect\nobservations of the disturbance and construct an accurate estimate of the\nunderlying disturbance function. We use Gaussian Process (GP) to get an\nestimate of the disturbance from data with a high-confidence bound on the\nregression error. Furthermore, we use neural Contraction Metrics to derive a\ntracking controller and the corresponding high-confidence uncertainty tube\naround the nominal trajectory planned for the robot, based on the estimate of\nthe disturbance. From the robustness of the Contraction Metric, error bound can\nbe pre-computed and used by the motion planner such that the actual trajectory\nis guaranteed to be safe. As the robot collects more and more observations\nalong its trajectory, the estimate of the disturbance becomes more and more\naccurate, which in turn improves the performance of the tracking controller and\nenlarges the free space that the robot can safely explore. We evaluate the\nproposed method using a carefully designed environment with a ground vehicle.\nResults show that with the proposed method the robot can thoroughly explore the\nenvironment safely and quickly.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to develop new mathematical and computational tools for\nmodeling the distribution of portfolio returns across portfolios. We establish\nrelevant mathematical formulas and propose efficient algorithms, drawing upon\npowerful techniques in computational geometry and the literature on splines, to\ncompute the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function,\nand the k-th moment of the probability function. Our algorithmic tools and\nimplementations efficiently handle portfolios with 10000 assets, and compute\nmoments of order k up to 40 in a few seconds, thus handling real-life\nscenarios. We focus on the long-only strategy which is the most common type of\ninvestment, i.e. on portfolios whose weights are non-negative and sum up to 1;\nour approach is readily generalizable. Thus, we leverage a geometric\nrepresentation of the stock market, where the investment set defines a simplex\npolytope. The cumulative distribution function corresponds to a portfolio score\ncapturing the percentage of portfolios yielding a return not exceeding a given\nvalue. We introduce closed-form analytic formulas for the first 4 moments of\nthe cross-sectional returns distribution, as well as a novel algorithm to\ncompute all higher moments. We show that the first 4 moments are a direct\nmapping of the asset returns' moments. All of our algorithms and solutions are\nfully general and include the special case of equal asset returns, which was\nsometimes excluded in previous works. Finally, we apply our portfolio score in\nthe design of new performance measures and asset management.

The SG-dominated grid is\ntraditionally analyzed in a mechanical-centric view which ignores fast\nelectrical dynamics and focuses on the torque-speed dynamics. By contrast,\nanalysis of the emergent IBR-dominated grid usually takes the\nelectrical-centric view which focuses on the voltage-current interaction. In\nthis article, a port-mapping method is proposed to fill the gap between these\napproaches and combine them in a unified model. Specifically, the mechanical\ndynamics are mapped to the electrical impedance seen at the electrical port;\nand the electrical dynamics are also mapped to the torque coefficient seen at\nthe mechanical port. The bidirectional mapping gives additional flexibility and\ninsights to analyze the sub-system interactions in whole-system dynamics and\nguide the tuning of parameter.

We build a co-occurrence\nnetwork of words using a web-scraped corpus of more than 7,000 peer-reviewed\nrecent ML papers -- consisting of papers both related and unrelated to TwML. We\nuse community detection to obtain semantic clusters of words in this network\nthat can infer relative positions of TwML topics. We propose an innovative\nfingerprinting algorithm to obtain probabilistic similarity scores for\nindividual words, then combine them to give a paper-level relevance score. The\noutcomes of our analysis inform a number of interesting insights on advancing\nthe field of TwML research.",

    "abstract": "Coordination is often critical to forming prosocial behaviors -- behaviors\nthat increase the overall sum of rewards received by all agents in a\nmulti-agent game. However, state of the art reinforcement learning algorithms\noften suffer from converging to socially less desirable equilibria when\nmultiple equilibria exist. Previous works address this challenge with explicit\nreward shaping, which requires the strong assumption that agents can be forced\nto be prosocial. We propose using a less restrictive peer-rewarding mechanism,\ngifting, that guides the agents toward more socially desirable equilibria while\nallowing agents to remain selfish and decentralized. Gifting allows each agent\nto give some of their reward to other agents. We employ a theoretical framework\nthat captures the benefit of gifting in converging to the prosocial equilibrium\nby characterizing the equilibria's basins of attraction in a dynamical system.\nWith gifting, we demonstrate increased convergence of high risk, general-sum\ncoordination games to the prosocial equilibrium both via numerical analysis and\nexperiments.",

    "abstract": "Estimating 3D human poses from video is a challenging problem. The lack of 3D\nhuman pose annotations is a major obstacle for supervised training and for\ngeneralization to unseen datasets. In this work, we address this problem by\nproposing a weakly-supervised training scheme that does not require 3D\nannotations or calibrated cameras. The proposed method relies on temporal\ninformation and triangulation. Using 2D poses from multiple views as the input,\nwe first estimate the relative camera orientations and then generate 3D poses\nvia triangulation. The triangulation is only applied to the views with high 2D\nhuman joint confidence. The generated 3D poses are then used to train a\nrecurrent lifting network (RLN) that estimates 3D poses from 2D poses. We\nfurther apply a multi-view re-projection loss to the estimated 3D poses and\nenforce the 3D poses estimated from multi-views to be consistent. Therefore,\nour method relaxes the constraints in practice, only multi-view videos are\nrequired for training, and is thus convenient for in-the-wild settings. At\ninference, RLN merely requires single-view videos. The proposed method\noutperforms previous works on two challenging datasets, Human3.6M and\nMPI-INF-3DHP.

The steep growth and vast adoption of IoT devices reinforce the\nimportance of sound and robust cybersecurity practices during the device\ndevelopment life-cycles. IoT-related vulnerabilities, if successfully exploited\ncan affect, not only the device itself, but also the application field in which\nthe IoT device operates. Evidently, identifying and addressing every single\nvulnerability is an arduous, if not impossible, task. Attack taxonomies can\nassist in classifying attacks and their corresponding vulnerabilities. Security\ncountermeasures and best practices can then be leveraged to mitigate threats\nand vulnerabilities before they emerge into catastrophic attacks and ensure\noverall secure IoT operation. Therefore, in this paper, we provide an attack\ntaxonomy which takes into consideration the different layers of IoT stack,\ni.e., device, infrastructure, communication, and service, and each layer's\ndesignated characteristics which can be exploited by adversaries. Furthermore,\nusing nine real-world cybersecurity incidents, that had targeted IoT devices\ndeployed in the consumer, commercial, and industrial sectors, we describe the\nIoT-related vulnerabilities, exploitation procedures, attacks, impacts, and\npotential mitigation mechanisms and protection strategies.

    "abstract": "A key way to construct complex distributed systems is through modular\ncomposition of linearizable concurrent objects. A prominent example is shared\nregisters, which have crash-tolerant implementations on top of message-passing\nsystems, allowing the advantages of shared memory to carry over to\nmessage-passing. Yet linearizable registers do not always behave properly when\nused inside randomized programs. A strengthening of linearizability, called\nstrong linearizability, has been shown to preserve probabilistic behavior, as\nwell as other hypersafety properties. In order to exploit composition and\nabstraction in message-passing systems, it is crucial to know whether there\nexist strongly-linearizable implementations of registers in message-passing.\nThis paper answers the question in the negative: there are no\nstrongly-linearizable fault-tolerant message-passing implementations of\nmulti-writer registers, max-registers, snapshots or counters. This result is\nproved by reduction from the corresponding result by Helmi et al. The reduction\nis a novel extension of the BG simulation that connects shared-memory and\nmessage-passing, supports long-lived objects, and preserves strong\nlinearizability. The main technical challenge arises from the discrepancy\nbetween the potentially minuscule fraction of failures to be tolerated in the\nsimulated message-passing algorithm and the large fraction of failures that can\nafflict the simulating shared-memory system. The reduction is general and can\nbe viewed as the reverse of the ABD simulation of shared memory in\nmessage-passing.",

Recently, vendors have\nintroduced programmable Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) that enable\ncomputations to be offloaded to the edge of the network. There is great\ninterest in both the HPC and high-performance data analytics communities in\nunderstanding the roles these devices may play in the data paths of upcoming\nsystems.\nThis paper focuses on characterizing both the networking and computing\naspects of NVIDIA's new BlueField-2 SmartNIC when used in an Ethernet\nenvironment. For the networking evaluation we conducted multiple transfer\nexperiments between processors located at the host, the SmartNIC, and a remote\nhost. These tests illuminate how much processing headroom is available on the\nSmartNIC during transfers. For the computing evaluation we used the stress-ng\nbenchmark to compare the BlueField-2 to other servers and place realistic\nbounds on the types of offload operations that are appropriate for the\nhardware.\nOur findings from this work indicate that while the BlueField-2 provides a\nflexible means of processing data at the network's edge, great care must be\ntaken to not overwhelm the hardware. While the host can easily saturate the\nnetwork link, the SmartNIC's embedded processors may not have enough computing\nresources to sustain more than half the expected bandwidth when using\nkernel-space packet processing. From a computational perspective, encryption\noperations, memory operations under contention, and on-card IPC operations on\nthe SmartNIC perform significantly better than the general-purpose servers used\nfor comparisons in our experiments.

Considering AU detection and facial expression recognition (FER)\nare two highly correlated tasks, and facial expression (FE) is relatively easy\nto annotate, we consider learning AU detection and FER in a multi-task manner.\nHowever, the performance of the AU detection task cannot be always enhanced due\nto the negative transfer in the multi-task scenario. To alleviate this issue,\nwe propose a Meta Auxiliary Learning method (MAL) that automatically selects\nhighly related FE samples by learning adaptative weights for the training FE\nsamples in a meta learning manner. The learned sample weights alleviate the\nnegative transfer from two aspects: 1) balance the loss of each task\nautomatically, and 2) suppress the weights of FE samples that have large\nuncertainties.

    "title": "Ordering-Based Causal Discovery with Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "It is a long-standing question to discover causal relations among a set of\nvariables in many empirical sciences. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has\nachieved promising results in causal discovery from observational data.\nHowever, searching the space of directed graphs and enforcing acyclicity by\nimplicit penalties tend to be inefficient and restrict the existing RL-based\nmethod to small scale problems. In this work, we propose a novel RL-based\napproach for causal discovery, by incorporating RL into the ordering-based\nparadigm. Specifically, we formulate the ordering search problem as a\nmulti-step Markov decision process, implement the ordering generating process\nwith an encoder-decoder architecture, and finally use RL to optimize the\nproposed model based on the reward mechanisms designed for~each ordering. A\ngenerated ordering would then be processed using variable selection to obtain\nthe final causal graph. We analyze the consistency and computational complexity\nof the proposed method, and empirically show that a pretrained model can be\nexploited to accelerate training. Experimental results on both synthetic and\nreal data sets shows that the proposed method achieves a much improved\nperformance over existing RL-based method.",

Therefore, this paper proposes an importance weighted\nadversarial autoencoder-based method to transfer anomaly detection knowledge in\nan unsupervised manner, particularly for a rarely studied scenario where a\ntarget domain has no labeled normal/abnormal data while only normal data from a\nrelated source domain exist. Specifically, the method learns to align the\ndistributions of normal data in both source and target domains, but leave the\ndistribution of abnormal data in the target domain unchanged. In this way, an\nobvious gap can be produced between the distributions of normal and abnormal\ndata in the target domain, therefore enabling the anomaly detection in the\ndomain.

To effectively realize the energy-efficient\nunderwater emergency response and adequately harness merits of different\nunderwater communication links (UCL), this article proposes an underwater\nemergency communication network (UECN) aided by multiple UCLs and autonomous\nunderwater vehicles (AUV) to collect underwater emergency data.

Second, based on the\ndistribution of IUSNs, we dispatch AUVs to assist IUSNs in underwater\ncommunication by jointly solving the optimal AUV position and velocity, which\ncan dramatically shorten the amount of time for data collection and motion.\nFinally, the best tradeoff between response efficiency and energy consumption\nis achieved by multiobjective optimization, where the amount of time for\nemergency response and the total energy consumption are simultaneously\nminimized, subject to a given set of transmit power,\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), outage probability, and energy\nconstraints.

    "abstract": "There is considerable interest in designing meta-reinforcement learning\n(meta-RL) algorithms, which enable autonomous agents to adapt new tasks from\nsmall amount of experience. In meta-RL, the specification (such as reward\nfunction) of current task is hidden from the agent. In addition, states are\nhidden within each task owing to sensor noise or limitations in realistic\nenvironments. Therefore, the meta-RL agent faces the challenge of specifying\nboth the hidden task and states based on small amount of experience. To address\nthis, we propose estimating disentangled belief about task and states,\nleveraging an inductive bias that the task and states can be regarded as global\nand local features of each task. Specifically, we train a hierarchical\nstate-space model (HSSM) parameterized by deep neural networks as an\nenvironment model, whose global and local latent variables correspond to task\nand states, respectively. Because the HSSM does not allow analytical\ncomputation of posterior distribution, i.e., belief, we employ amortized\ninference to approximate it. After the belief is obtained, we can augment\nobservations of a model-free policy with the belief to efficiently train the\npolicy. Moreover, because task and state information are factorized and\ninterpretable, the downstream policy training is facilitated compared with the\nprior methods that did not consider the hierarchical nature. Empirical\nvalidations on a GridWorld environment confirm that the HSSM can separate the\nhidden task and states information. Then, we compare the meta-RL agent with the\nHSSM to prior meta-RL methods in MuJoCo environments, and confirm that our\nagent requires less training data and reaches higher final performance.",

The\nstate-of-the-art techniques in this area fall into three groups: cache-aware\ntiled looping algorithms, cache-oblivious divide-and-conquer trapezoidal\nalgorithms, and Krylov subspace methods.\nIn this paper, we present two efficient parallel algorithms for performing\nlinear stencil computations. Current direct solvers in this domain are\ncomputationally inefficient, and Krylov methods require manual labor and\nmathematical training. We solve these problems for linear stencils by using DFT\npreconditioning on a Krylov method to achieve a direct solver which is both\nfast and general. Indeed, while all currently available algorithms for solving\ngeneral linear stencils perform $\\Theta(NT)$ work, where $N$ is the size of the\nspatial grid and $T$ is the number of timesteps, our algorithms perform $o(NT)$\nwork.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we give the first algorithms that use fast\nFourier transforms to compute final grid data by evolving the initial data for\nmany timesteps at once. Our algorithms handle both periodic and aperiodic\nboundary conditions, and achieve polynomially better performance bounds (i.e.,\ncomputational complexity and parallel runtime) than all other existing\nsolutions.\nInitial experimental results show that implementations of our algorithms that\nevolve grids of roughly $10^7$ cells for around $10^5$ timesteps run orders of\nmagnitude faster than state-of-the-art implementations for periodic stencil\nproblems, and 1.3$\\times$ to 8.5$\\times$ faster for aperiodic stencil problems.",

We show that checking that all time-divergent paths of a\ntimed automaton satisfy such a window parity objective can be done in\npolynomial space, and that the corresponding timed games can be solved in\nexponential time. This matches the complexity class of timed parity games,\nwhile adding the ability to reason about time bounds.

    "abstract": "It is known that the kinematics of the human body skeleton reveals valuable\ninformation in action recognition. Recently, modeling skeletons as\nspatio-temporal graphs with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) has been\nreported to solidly advance the state-of-the-art performance. However,\nGCN-based approaches exclusively learn from raw skeleton data, and are expected\nto extract the inherent structural information on their own. This paper\ndescribes REGINA, introducing a novel way to REasoning Graph convolutional\nnetworks IN Human Action recognition. The rationale is to provide to the GCNs\nadditional knowledge about the skeleton data, obtained by handcrafted features,\nin order to facilitate the learning process, while guaranteeing that it remains\nfully trainable in an end-to-end manner. The challenge is to capture\ncomplementary information over the dynamics between consecutive frames, which\nis the key information extracted by state-of-the-art GCN techniques. Moreover,\nthe proposed strategy can be easily integrated in the existing GCN-based\nmethods, which we also regard positively. Our experiments were carried out in\nwell known action recognition datasets and enabled to conclude that REGINA\ncontributes for solid improvements in performance when incorporated to other\nGCN-based approaches, without any other adjustment regarding the original\nmethod.

    "abstract": "Self-adjusting computation is an approach for automatically producing dynamic\nalgorithms from static ones. The approach works by tracking control and data\ndependencies, and propagating changes through the dependencies when making an\nupdate. Extensively studied in the sequential setting, some results on parallel\nself-adjusting computation exist, but are either only applicable to limited\nclasses of computations, such as map-reduce, or are ad-hoc systems with no\ntheoretical analysis of their performance.\nIn this paper, we present the first system for parallel self-adjusting\ncomputation that applies to a wide class of nested parallel algorithms and\nprovides theoretical bounds on the work and span of the resulting dynamic\nalgorithms. As with bounds in the sequential setting, our bounds relate a\n\"distance\" measure between computations on different inputs to the cost of\npropagating an update. However, here we also consider parallelism in the\npropagation cost. The main innovation in the paper is in using Series-Parallel\ntrees (SP trees) to track sequential and parallel control dependencies to allow\npropagation of changes to be applied safely in parallel. We show both\ntheoretically and through experiments that our system allows algorithms to\nproduce updated results over large datasets significantly faster than\nfrom-scratch execution. We demonstrate our system with several example\napplications, including algorithms for dynamic sequences and dynamic trees.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised node classification on graphs is an important research\nproblem, with many real-world applications in information retrieval such as\ncontent classification on a social network and query intent classification on\nan e-commerce query graph. While traditional approaches are largely\ntransductive, recent graph neural networks (GNNs) integrate node features with\nnetwork structures, thus enabling inductive node classification models that can\nbe applied to new nodes or even new graphs in the same feature space. However,\ninter-graph differences still exist across graphs within the same domain. Thus,\ntraining just one global model (e.g., a state-of-the-art GNN) to handle all new\ngraphs, whilst ignoring the inter-graph differences, can lead to suboptimal\nperformance.\nIn this paper, we study the problem of inductive node classification across\ngraphs. Unlike existing one-model-fits-all approaches, we propose a novel\nmeta-inductive framework called MI-GNN to customize the inductive model to each\ngraph under a meta-learning paradigm. That is, MI-GNN does not directly learn\nan inductive model; it learns the general knowledge of how to train a model for\nsemi-supervised node classification on new graphs. To cope with the differences\nacross graphs, MI-GNN employs a dual adaptation mechanism at both the graph and\ntask levels. More specifically, we learn a graph prior to adapt for the\ngraph-level differences, and a task prior to adapt for the task-level\ndifferences conditioned on a graph.

    "abstract": "The benefits of deep neural networks (DNNs) have become of interest for\nsafety critical applications like medical ones or automated driving. Here,\nhowever, quantitative insights into the DNN inner representations are\nmandatory. One approach to this is concept analysis, which aims to establish a\nmapping between the internal representation of a DNN and intuitive semantic\nconcepts. Such can be sub-objects like human body parts that are valuable for\nvalidation of pedestrian detection. To our knowledge, concept analysis has not\nyet been applied to large object detectors, specifically not for sub-parts.\nTherefore, this work first suggests a substantially improved version of the\nNet2Vec approach (arXiv:1801.03454) for post-hoc segmentation of sub-objects.\nIts practical applicability is then demonstrated on a new concept dataset by\ntwo exemplary assessments of three standard networks, including the larger Mask\nR-CNN model (arXiv:1703.06870): (1) the consistency of body part similarity,\nand (2) the invariance of internal representations of body parts with respect\nto the size in pixels of the depicted person. The findings show that the\nrepresentation of body parts is mostly size invariant, which may suggest an\nearly intelligent fusion of information in different size categories.",

    "abstract": "Companies and network operators perform risk assessment to inform\npolicy-making, guide infrastructure investments or to comply with security\nstandards such as ISO 27001. Due to the size and complexity of these networks,\nrisk assessment techniques such as attack graphs or trees describe the attacker\nwith a finite set of rules. This characterization of the attacker can easily\nmiss attack vectors or overstate them, potentially leading to incorrect risk\nestimation.\nIn this work, we propose the first methodology to justify a rule-based\nattacker model. Conceptually, we add another layer of abstraction on top of the\nsymbolic model of cryptography, which reasons about protocols and abstracts\ncryptographic primitives. This new layer reasons about Internet-scale networks\nand abstracts protocols.\nWe show, in general, how the soundness and completeness of a rule-based model\ncan be ensured by verifying trace properties, linking soundness to safety\nproperties and completeness to liveness properties. We then demonstrate the\napproach for a recently proposed threat model that quantifies the\nconfidentiality of email communication on the Internet, including DNS, DNSSEC,\nand SMTP. Using off-the-shelf protocol verification tools, we discover two\nflaws in their threat model. After fixing them, we show that it provides\nsymbolic soundness.",

    "title": "Exploring the Intrinsic Probability Distribution for Hyperspectral  Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "In recent years, neural network-based anomaly detection methods have\nattracted considerable attention in the hyperspectral remote sensing domain due\nto the powerful reconstruction ability compared with traditional methods.\nHowever, actual probability distribution statistics hidden in the latent space\nare not discovered by exploiting the reconstruction error because the\nprobability distribution of anomalies is not explicitly modeled. To address the\nissue, we propose a novel probability distribution representation detector\n(PDRD) that explores the intrinsic distribution of both the background and the\nanomalies in original data for hyperspectral anomaly detection in this paper.\nFirst, we represent the hyperspectral data with multivariate Gaussian\ndistributions from a probabilistic perspective. Then, we combine the local\nstatistics with the obtained distributions to leverage the spatial information.\nFinally, the difference between the corresponding distributions of the test\npixel and the average expectation of the pixels in the Chebyshev neighborhood\nis measured by computing the modified Wasserstein distance to acquire the\ndetection map. We conduct the experiments on four real data sets to evaluate\nthe performance of our proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate the\naccuracy and efficiency of our proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art\ndetection methods.",

    "abstract": "Decision lists (DLs) find a wide range of uses for classification problems in\nMachine Learning (ML), being implemented in a number of ML frameworks. DLs are\noften perceived as interpretable. However, building on recent results for\ndecision trees (DTs), we argue that interpretability is an elusive goal for\nsome DLs. As a result, for some uses of DLs, it will be important to compute\n(rigorous) explanations. Unfortunately, and in clear contrast with the case of\nDTs, this paper shows that computing explanations for DLs is computationally\nhard. Motivated by this result, the paper proposes propositional encodings for\ncomputing abductive explanations (AXps) and contrastive explanations (CXps) of\nDLs. Furthermore, the paper investigates the practical efficiency of a\nMARCO-like approach for enumerating explanations. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that, for DLs used in practical settings, the use of SAT oracles\noffers a very efficient solution, and that complete enumeration of explanations\nis most often feasible.",

Explainable methods are considered the gateway to alleviate many of\nthese concerns. In this study we demonstrate that the generated explanations\nare volatile to changes in model training that are perpendicular to the\nclassification task and model structure. This raises further questions about\ntrust in deep learning models for healthcare. Mainly, whether the models\ncapture underlying causal links in the data or just rely on spurious\ncorrelations that are made visible via explanation methods. We demonstrate that\nthe output of explainability methods on deep neural networks can vary\nsignificantly by changes of hyper-parameters, such as the random seed or how\nthe training set is shuffled. We introduce a measure of explanation consistency\nwhich we use to highlight the identified problems on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. We\nfind explanations of identical models but with different training setups have a\nlow consistency: $\\approx$ 33% on average. On the contrary, kernel methods are\nrobust against any orthogonal changes, with explanation consistency at 94%.

Although these methods have the innate ability to handle\nnested NER, they suffer from high computational cost, ignorance of boundary\ninformation, under-utilization of the spans that partially match with entities,\nand difficulties in long entity recognition. To tackle these issues, we propose\na two-stage entity identifier.

Through boundary regression, entities\nof any length can be covered theoretically, which improves the ability to\nrecognize long entities.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed unprecedented success achieved by deep learning\nmodels in the field of computer vision. However, their vulnerability towards\ncarefully crafted adversarial examples has also attracted the increasing\nattention of researchers. Motivated by the observation that adversarial\nexamples are due to the non-robust feature learned from the original dataset by\nmodels, we propose the concepts of salient feature(SF) and trivial feature(TF).\nThe former represents the class-related feature, while the latter is usually\nadopted to mislead the model. We extract these two features with coupled\ngenerative adversarial network model and put forward a novel detection and\ndefense method named salient feature extractor (SFE) to defend against\nadversarial attacks. Concretely, detection is realized by separating and\ncomparing the difference between SF and TF of the input. At the same time,\ncorrect labels are obtained by re-identifying SF to reach the purpose of\ndefense. Extensive experiments are carried out on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet\ndatasets where SFE shows state-of-the-art results in effectiveness and\nefficiency compared with baselines.

    "title": "Threshold Martingales and the Evolution of Forecasts",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a martingale that characterizes two properties of\nevolving forecast distributions. Ideal forecasts of a future event behave as\nmartingales, sequen- tially updating the forecast to leverage the available\ninformation as the future event approaches. The threshold martingale introduced\nhere measures the proportion of the forecast distribution lying below a\nthreshold. In addition to being calibrated, a threshold martingale has\nquadratic variation that accumulates to a total determined by a quantile of the\ninitial forecast distribution. Deviations from calibration or to- tal\nvolatility signal problems in the underlying model. Calibration adjustments are\nwell-known, and we augment these by introducing a martingale filter that\nimproves volatility while guaranteeing smaller mean squared error. Thus,\npost-processing can rectify problems with calibration and volatility without\nrevisiting the original forecast- ing model. We apply threshold martingales\nfirst to forecasts from simulated models and then to models that predict the\nwinner in professional basketball games.",

    "abstract": "Typical Node.js applications extensively rely on packages hosted in the npm\nregistry. As such packages may be used by thousands of other packages or\napplications, it is important to assess their code coverage. Moreover,\nincreasing code coverage may help detect previously unknown issues. In this\npaper, we introduce TESA, a new tool that automatically assembles a test suite\nfor any package in the npm registry. The test suite includes 1) tests written\nfor the target package and usually hosted in its development repository, and 2)\ntests selected from dependent packages. The former tests allow assessing the\ncode coverage of the target package, while the latter ones can increase code\ncoverage by exploiting third-party tests that also exercise code in the target\npackage. We use TESA to assess the code coverage of 500 popular npm packages.\nThen, we demonstrate that TESA can significantly increase code coverage by\nincluding tests from dependent packages. Finally, we show that the test suites\nassembled by TESA increase the effectiveness of existing dynamic program\nanalyses to identify performance issues that are not detectable when only\nexecuting the developer's tests.",

In this study, we leverage\nwell-established cognitive models coming from anthropology in order to\ncharacterise the personal network of collaborations between scientists, i.e.,\nthe network considered from the standpoint of each individual researcher\n(referred to as ego network), in terms of the cognitive investment they devote\nto the different collaborations. Building upon these models, we study the\ninterplay between the structure of academic collaborations, academic\nperformance, and academic mobility at different career stages. We take into\naccount both purely academic mobility (i.e., the number of affiliation changes)\nand geographical mobility (i.e., physical relocations to different countries).\nFor our investigation, we rely on a dataset comprising the geo-referenced\npublications of a group of 81,500 authors extracted from Scopus, one of the\nbiggest repositories of academic knowledge. Our main finding is that there is a\nclear correlation between the structure of co-authorship ego networks and\nacademic performance indices: the more one publishes and the higher their\nimpact, the larger their collaboration network. However, we observe a capacity\nbound effect, whereby, beyond a certain point, higher performances become\nincreasingly less correlated with large collaboration networks. We also find\nthat international academic migrants are better at growing their networks than\nresearchers that only migrate within the same country, but the latter seem to\nbe better in exploiting their collaboration to achieve higher impact. High\nacademic mobility does not appear to translate into better academic performance\nor larger collaboration networks.",

However, its definition\ntacitly assumes that new information is used at any time, which is not always\nthe case: the instants at which information is collected and used are dependent\non a certain query process. We propose a model that accounts for the discrete\ntime nature of many monitoring processes, considering a pull-based\ncommunication model in which the freshness of information is only important\nwhen the receiver generates a query: if the monitoring process is not using the\nvalue, the age of the last update is irrelevant. We then define the Age of\nInformation at Query (QAoI), a more general metric that fits the pull-based\nscenario, and show how its optimization can lead to very different choices from\ntraditional push-based AoI optimization when using a Packet Erasure Channel\n(PEC) and with limited link availability.

This two-step solution involves two independently trained\nmodels, which may not be well compatible with each other. A small estimation\nerror of the first step could cause a severe performance drop of the second\none. While on the other hand, the first step can only utilize limited\ninformation from the LR image, which makes it difficult to predict a highly\naccurate blur kernel. Towards these issues, instead of considering these two\nsteps separately, we adopt an alternating optimization algorithm, which can\nestimate the blur kernel and restore the SR image in a single model.\nSpecifically, we design two convolutional neural modules, namely\n\\textit{Restorer} and \\textit{Estimator}. \\textit{Restorer} restores the SR\nimage based on the predicted kernel, and \\textit{Estimator} estimates the blur\nkernel with the help of the restored SR image. We alternate these two modules\nrepeatedly and unfold this process to form an end-to-end trainable network. In\nthis way, \\textit{Estimator} utilizes information from both LR and SR images,\nwhich makes the estimation of the blur kernel easier. More importantly,\n\\textit{Restorer} is trained with the kernel estimated by \\textit{Estimator},\ninstead of the ground-truth kernel, thus \\textit{Restorer} could be more\ntolerant to the estimation error of \\textit{Estimator}. Extensive experiments\non synthetic datasets and real-world images show that our model can largely\noutperform state-of-the-art methods and produce more visually favorable results\nat a much higher speed.

The lower frequencies of the legacy frequency bands of\nmacro outdoor cells manage to provide coverage inside buildings, however, new\nfrequencies foreseen for the 5th generation (5G) of mobile communications in\nthe millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum penetrate very poorly into buildings.\nTherefore, a massive densification of the network would require to deploy a\nlarge number of indoor small cells, which would lead to high deployment costs\nto install the necessary wired/optical backhaul.

    "title": "DoS and DDoS Mitigation Using Variational Autoencoders",
    "abstract": "DoS and DDoS attacks have been growing in size and number over the last\ndecade and existing solutions to mitigate these attacks are in general\ninefficient. Compared to other types of malicious cyber attacks, DoS and DDoS\nattacks are particularly more challenging to combat. With their ability to mask\nthemselves as legitimate traffic, developing methods to detect these types of\nattacks on a packet or flow level, has proven to be a difficult task. In this\npaper, we explore the potential of Variational Autoencoders to serve as a\ncomponent within an intelligent security solution that differentiates between\nnormal and malicious traffic. Two methods based on the ability of Variational\nAutoencoders to learn latent representations from network traffic flows are\nproposed. The first method resorts to a classifier based on the latent\nencodings obtained from Variational Autoencoders learned from traffic traces.\nThe second method is rather an anomaly detection method where the Variational\nAutoencoder is used to learn the abstract feature representations of\nexclusively legitimate traffic. Then anomalies are filtered out by relying on\nthe reconstruction loss of the Variational Autoencoder.\nBoth of the proposed methods have been thoroughly tested on two separate\ndatasets with a similar feature space. The results show that both methods are\npromising, with a slight superiority of the classifier based method over the\nanomaly based one.\n%that the first method is able to successfully detect individual traffic\nflows with high precision on the training and validation data, slightly less\nsuccessfully on the test data. For the second method, the Variational\nAutoencoder will require further adjustments to be able to sufficiently filter\nout anomalies from network traffic flows.",

    "abstract": "A well-known challenge in the semantics of programming languages is how to\ncombine non-determinism and probability. At a technical level, the problem\narises from the fact that there is a no distributive law between the powerset\nmonad and the distribution monad - as noticed some twenty years ago by Plotkin.\nMore recently, it has become clear that there is a distributive law of the\nmultiset monad over the distribution monad. This article elaborates the details\nof this distributivity and shows that there is a rich underlying theory\nrelating multisets and probability distributions. It is shown that the new\ndistributive law, called parallel multinomial law, can be defined in (at least)\nfour equivalent ways. It involves putting multinomial distributions in parallel\nand commutes with hypergeometric distributions. Further, it is shown that this\ndistributive law commutes with a new form of zipping for multisets. Abstractly,\nthis can be described in terms of monoidal structure for a fixed-size multiset\nfunctor, when lifted to the Kleisli category of the distribution monad.\nConcretely, an application of the theory to sampling semantics is included.",

This renders\ncellular network coverage from outdoor cell sites difficult. Indoor small cells\nand distributed antennas along train tracks are often considered as a solution,\nbut the cost and the need for optical fiber backhaul are often prohibitive. To\nalleviate this issue, we describe an out-of-band repeater that converts a sub-6\nGHz cell signal from a small cell installed at a cell tower to a mmWave\nfrequency for the fronthaul to buildings or distributed antenna sites, where\nthe signal is downconverted to the original frequency and emitted for example\ninside a building. This concept does not require fiber deployment, provides\nbackward compatibility to equipment already in use, and additional indoor\ncapacity is gained while outdoor networks are offloaded. The architecture and\nhardware prototype implementation are described, and measurements are reported\nto demonstrate the functionality and compatibility with commercial\ninfrastructure and mobile terminals.",

The dataset has two testing scenarios, chunk mode and full\nmode, depending on whether the grounded chunk is provided or retrieved from a\nlarge conversational pool. Experimental results show that state-of-the-art QA\nsystems trained on existing QA datasets have limited zero-shot ability and tend\nto predict our questions as unanswerable.

    "abstract": "Reservoir computing (RC) offers efficient temporal data processing with a low\ntraining cost by separating recurrent neural networks into a fixed network with\nrecurrent connections and a trainable linear network. The quality of the fixed\nnetwork, called reservoir, is the most important factor that determines the\nperformance of the RC system. In this paper, we investigate the influence of\nthe hierarchical reservoir structure on the properties of the reservoir and the\nperformance of the RC system. Analogous to deep neural networks, stacking\nsub-reservoirs in series is an efficient way to enhance the nonlinearity of\ndata transformation to high-dimensional space and expand the diversity of\ntemporal information captured by the reservoir. These deep reservoir systems\noffer better performance when compared to simply increasing the size of the\nreservoir or the number of sub-reservoirs. Low frequency components are mainly\ncaptured by the sub-reservoirs in later stage of the deep reservoir structure,\nsimilar to observations that more abstract information can be extracted by\nlayers in the late stage of deep neural networks. When the total size of the\nreservoir is fixed, tradeoff between the number of sub-reservoirs and the size\nof each sub-reservoir needs to be carefully considered, due to the degraded\nability of individual sub-reservoirs at small sizes. Improved performance of\nthe deep reservoir structure alleviates the difficulty of implementing the RC\nsystem on hardware systems.",

    "abstract": "Recent data protection regulations (such as GDPR and CCPA) grant consumers\nvarious rights, including the right to access, modify or delete any personal\ninformation collected about them (and retained) by a service provider. To\nexercise these rights, one must submit a verifiable consumer request proving\nthat collected data indeed pertains to them. This action is relatively\nstraightforward for consumers with active accounts with a service provider at\nthe time of data collection, since they can use standard (e.g., password-based)\nmeans of authentication to validate their requests. However, a major conundrum\narises from the need to support consumers without accounts to exercise their\nrights. To this end, some service providers began requiring these accountless\nconsumers to reveal and prove their identities (e.g., using government-issued\ndocuments, utility bills or credit card numbers) as part of issuing a\nverifiable consumer request. While understandable as a short-term cure, this\napproach is, at the same time, cumbersome and expensive for service providers\nas well as very privacy-invasive for consumers. Consequently, there is a strong\nneed to provide better means of authenticating requests from accountless\nconsumers. To achieve this, we propose VICEROY, a privacy-preserving and\nscalable framework for producing proofs of data ownership, which can be used as\na basis for verifiable consumer requests. Building upon existing web techniques\nand features (e.g., cookies), VICEROY allows accountless consumers to interact\nwith service providers, and later prove -- in a privacy-preserving manner --\nthat they are the same person, with minimal requirements for both parties. We\ndesign and implement VICEROY with the emphasis on security/privacy,\ndeployability and usability. We also thoroughly assess its practicality via\nextensive experiments.",

Efficiency is\nespecially impressive because directly computing an optimal plan is\nintractable, even for modestly complex tasks, and yet people successfully solve\nmyriad everyday problems despite limited cognitive resources. Standard accounts\nin psychology, economics, and artificial intelligence have suggested this is\nbecause people have a mental representation of a task and then use heuristics\nto plan in that representation. However, this approach generally assumes that\nmental representations are fixed. Here, we propose that mental representations\ncan be controlled and that this provides opportunities to adaptively simplify\nproblems so they can be more easily reasoned about -- a process we refer to as\nconstrual. We construct a formal model of this process and, in a series of\nlarge, pre-registered behavioral experiments, show both that construal is\nsubject to online cognitive control and that people form value-guided\nconstruals that optimally balance the complexity of a representation and its\nutility for planning and acting.

Applying\nthis method to study how BERT uses relative clause (RC) span information, we\nfound that BERT uses information about RC spans during agreement prediction\nusing the linguistically strategy. We also found that counterfactual\nrepresentations generated for a specific RC subtype influenced the number\nprediction in sentences with other RC subtypes, suggesting that information\nabout RC boundaries was encoded abstractly in BERT's representation.",

    "title": "Open-set Face Recognition for Small Galleries Using Siamese Networks",
    "abstract": "Face recognition has been one of the most relevant and explored fields of\nBiometrics. In real-world applications, face recognition methods usually must\ndeal with scenarios where not all probe individuals were seen during the\ntraining phase (open-set scenarios). Therefore, open-set face recognition is a\nsubject of increasing interest as it deals with identifying individuals in a\nspace where not all faces are known in advance. This is useful in several\napplications, such as access authentication, on which only a few individuals\nthat have been previously enrolled in a gallery are allowed. The present work\nintroduces a novel approach towards open-set face recognition focusing on small\ngalleries and in enrollment detection, not identity retrieval. A Siamese\nNetwork architecture is proposed to learn a model to detect if a face probe is\nenrolled in the gallery based on a verification-like approach. Promising\nresults were achieved for small galleries on experiments carried out on\nPubfig83, FRGCv1 and LFW datasets. State-of-the-art methods like HFCN and HPLS\nwere outperformed on FRGCv1. Besides, a new evaluation protocol is introduced\nfor experiments in small galleries on LFW.",

    "abstract": "Human fallibility, unpredictable operating environments, and the\nheterogeneity of hardware devices are driving the need for software to be able\nto adapt as seen in the Internet of Things or telecommunication networks.\nUnfortunately, mainstream programming languages do not readily allow a software\ncomponent to sense and respond to its operating environment, by discovering,\nreplacing, and communicating with components that are not part of the original\nsystem design, while maintaining static correctness guarantees. In particular,\nif a new component is discovered at runtime, there is no guarantee that its\ncommunication behaviour is compatible with existing components.\nWe address this problem by using multiparty session types with explicit\nconnection actions, a type formalism used to model distributed communication\nprotocols. By associating session types with software components, the discovery\nprocess can check protocol compatibility and, when required, correctly replace\ncomponents without jeapordising safety.\nWe present the design and implementation of EnsembleS, the first actor-based\nlanguage with adaptive features and a static session type system, and apply it\nto a case study based on an adaptive DNS server. We formalise the type system\nof EnsembleS and prove the safety of well-typed programs, making essential use\nof recent advances in non-classical multiparty session types.",

In this setting, the choice of\npreconditioner is crucial to ensure fast convergence and retain the inherent\nparallelism of the saddle point formulation. We propose new preconditioning\napproaches for the model term and observation error covariance term which lead\nto fast convergence of preconditioned Krylov subspace methods, and many of\nthese suggested approximations are highly parallelisable. In particular our\nnovel approach includes model information in the model term within the\npreconditioner, which to our knowledge has not previously been considered for\ndata assimilation problems. We develop new theory demonstrating the\neffectiveness of the new preconditioners for a specific class of problems.\nLinear and non-linear numerical experiments reveal that our new approach leads\nto faster convergence than existing state-of-the-art preconditioners for a\nbroader range of problems than indicated by the theory alone.

To answer these\nquestions, we introduce SCAT (Supporting Context for Ambiguous Translations), a\nnew English-French dataset comprising supporting context words for 14K\ntranslations that professional translators found useful for pronoun\ndisambiguation. Using SCAT, we perform an in-depth analysis of the context used\nto disambiguate, examining positional and lexical characteristics of the\nsupporting words.

    "abstract": "Ensembles of machine learning models yield improved system performance as\nwell as robust and interpretable uncertainty estimates; however, their\ninference costs may often be prohibitively high. \\emph{Ensemble Distribution\nDistillation} is an approach that allows a single model to efficiently capture\nboth the predictive performance and uncertainty estimates of an ensemble. For\nclassification, this is achieved by training a Dirichlet distribution over the\nensemble members' output distributions via the maximum likelihood criterion.\nAlthough theoretically principled, this criterion exhibits poor convergence\nwhen applied to large-scale tasks where the number of classes is very high. In\nour work, we analyze this effect and show that the Dirichlet log-likelihood\ncriterion classes with low probability induce larger gradients than\nhigh-probability classes. This forces the model to focus on the distribution of\nthe ensemble tail-class probabilities. We propose a new training objective that\nminimizes the reverse KL-divergence to a \\emph{Proxy-Dirichlet} target derived\nfrom the ensemble.

    "abstract": "We present a unified and hardware efficient architecture for two stage voice\ntrigger detection (VTD) and false trigger mitigation (FTM) tasks. Two stage VTD\nsystems of voice assistants can get falsely activated to audio segments\nacoustically similar to the trigger phrase of interest. FTM systems cancel such\nactivations by using post trigger audio context. Traditional FTM systems rely\non automatic speech recognition lattices which are computationally expensive to\nobtain on device. We propose a streaming transformer (TF) encoder architecture,\nwhich progressively processes incoming audio chunks and maintains audio context\nto perform both VTD and FTM tasks using only acoustic features. The proposed\njoint model yields an average 18% relative reduction in false reject rate (FRR)\nfor the VTD task at a given false alarm rate. Moreover, our model suppresses\n95% of the false triggers with an additional one second of post-trigger audio.\nFinally, on-device measurements show 32% reduction in runtime memory and 56%\nreduction in inference time compared to non-streaming version of the model.",

Our numerical analysis employs a novel overlap method that\nconstructs \"numerically global\" (i.e., with spatial domain arbitrarily large\nbut finite) flow solutions with initial data covering analytically distinct\nregions. Our numerical results show that for certain prescribed families of\nperturbations, there are two classes of initial data that lead to distinct\nbehaviors under mean curvature flow. Firstly, there is a \"near\" class of\ninitial data which lead to the same singular behaviour as an unperturbed\nsolution; in particular, the curvature at the tip of the hypersurface blows up\nat a Type-II rate no slower than $(T-t)^{-1}$. Secondly, there is a \"far\" class\nof initial data which lead to solutions developing a local Type-I nondegenerate\nneckpinch under mean curvature flow.

    "abstract": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to devastate globally, the use of chest\nX-ray (CXR) imaging as a complimentary screening strategy to RT-PCR testing\ncontinues to grow given its routine clinical use for respiratory complaint. As\npart of the COVID-Net open source initiative, we introduce COVID-Net CXR-2, an\nenhanced deep convolutional neural network design for COVID-19 detection from\nCXR images built using a greater quantity and diversity of patients than the\noriginal COVID-Net. To facilitate this, we also introduce a new benchmark\ndataset composed of 19,203 CXR images from a multinational cohort of 16,656\npatients from at least 51 countries, making it the largest, most diverse\nCOVID-19 CXR dataset in open access form. The COVID-Net CXR-2 network achieves\nsensitivity and positive predictive value of 95.5%/97.0%, respectively, and was\naudited in a transparent and responsible manner. Explainability-driven\nperformance validation was used during auditing to gain deeper insights in its\ndecision-making behaviour and to ensure clinically relevant factors are\nleveraged for improving trust in its usage. Radiologist validation was also\nconducted, where select cases were reviewed and reported on by two\nboard-certified radiologists with over 10 and 19 years of experience,\nrespectively, and showed that the critical factors leveraged by COVID-Net CXR-2\nare consistent with radiologist interpretations. While not a production-ready\nsolution, we hope the open-source, open-access release of COVID-Net CXR-2 and\nthe respective CXR benchmark dataset will encourage researchers, clinical\nscientists, and citizen scientists to accelerate advancements and innovations\nin the fight against the pandemic.",

It\ngeneralizes arbitrary sampling rate conversion by accommodating time-varying\nconversion ratios, i.e., it can efficiently adapt to instantaneous changes of\nthe input and output sampling rates. This approach is based on appropriately\nfactorizing the time-varying discrete-time filter used for the conversion.\nCommon filters that satisfy this factorization property are those where the\nunderlying continuous-time filter consists of linear combinations of\nexponentials, e.g., those described by linear constant-coefficient differential\nequations. This factorization separates the computation into two parts: one\nconsisting of a factor solely depending on the output sampling instants and the\nother consists of a summation -- that can be computed recursively -- whose\nterms depend solely on the input sampling instants and its number of terms is\ngiven by a relationship between input and output sampling instants. Thus,\nnonuniform sampling rates can be accommodated by updating the factors involved\nand adjusting the number of terms added. When the impulse response consists of\nexponentials, computing the factors can be done recursively in an efficient\nmanner.",

Analogously, if a sofic\nshift is quotiented by a sofic equivalence relation, we call the resulting\nsystem sofically presented. Generalizing an observation of Fried, for all\ndiscrete countable monoids M, we show that M-subshift/SFT systems are precisely\nthe expansive dynamical M-systems, where S_1/S_2 denotes the class of systems\nobtained by quotienting subshifts in S_1 by (relative) subshifts in S_2. We\nshow that for all finitely generated infinite monoids M, M-SFT \\subsetneq\nM-sofic \\subsetneq M-SFT/SFT = M-sofic/SFT \\subsetneq M-SFT/sofic =\nM-sofic/sofic, and that Ma\\~n\\'e's theorem about the dimension of expansive\nsystems characterizes the virtually cyclic groups.\nIn the case of one-dimensional actions, Ma\\~ne's theorem generalizes to\nsofically presented systems, which also have finite topological dimension. The\nbasis of this is the construction of an explicit metric for a sofically\npresented system. We show that any finite connected simplicial complex is a\nconnected component of a finitely presented system, and prove that conjugacy of\none-dimensional sofically presented dynamical systems is undecidable. A key\nidea is the introduction of so-called automatic spaces. We also study the\nautomorphism groups and periodic points of sofically presented systems.\nWe also perform two case studies.

A\ntotal of 472 days of my sleep data was collected with an Oura ring and combined\nwith lifestyle, environmental, and psychological data. Such n-of-1 QS projects\npose a number of challenges: heterogeneous data sources; missing values; high\ndimensionality; dynamic feedback loops; human biases. This paper directly\naddresses these challenges with an end-to-end QS pipeline that produces robust\ndescriptive models. Sleep quality is one of the most difficult modelling\ntargets in QS research, due to high noise and a large number of\nweakly-contributing factors. Sleep quality was selected so that approaches from\nthis paper would generalise to most other n-of-1 QS projects. Techniques are\npresented for combining and engineering features for the different classes of\ndata types, sample frequencies, and schema - including event logs, weather, and\ngeo-spatial data. Statistical analyses for outliers, normality,\n(auto)correlation, stationarity, and missing data are detailed, along with a\nproposed method for hierarchical clustering to identify correlated groups of\nfeatures. The missing data was overcome using a combination of knowledge-based\nand statistical techniques, including several multivariate imputation\nalgorithms. \"Markov unfolding\" is presented for collapsing the time series into\na collection of independent observations, whilst incorporating historical\ninformation. The final model was interpreted in two ways: by inspecting the\ninternal $\\beta$-parameters, and using the SHAP framework. These two\ninterpretation techniques were combined to produce a list of the 16\nmost-predictive features, demonstrating that an observational study can greatly\nnarrow down the number of features that need to be considered when designing\ninterventional QS studies.",

First, we\npredict the target resolution from the degraded manga via the Scale Estimation\nNetwork (SE-Net) with spatial voting scheme. Then, at the target resolution, we\nrestore the region-wise bitonal screentones via the Manga Restoration Network\n(MR-Net) discriminatively, depending on the degradation degree. Specifically,\nthe original screentones are directly restored in pattern-identifiable regions,\nand visually plausible screentones are synthesized in pattern-agnostic regions.\nQuantitative evaluation on synthetic data and visual assessment on real-world\ncases illustrate the effectiveness of our method.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic modelling of complex systems plays an essential, yet often\ncomputationally intensive role across the quantitative sciences. Recent\nadvances in quantum information processing have elucidated the potential for\nquantum simulators to exhibit memory advantages for such tasks. Heretofore, the\nfocus has been on lossless memory compression, wherein the advantage is\ntypically in terms of lessening the amount of information tracked by the model,\nwhile -- arguably more practical -- reductions in memory dimension are not\nalways possible. Here we address the case of lossy compression for quantum\nstochastic modelling of continuous-time processes, introducing a method for\ncoarse-graining in quantum state space that drastically reduces the requisite\nmemory dimension for modelling temporal dynamics whilst retaining near-exact\nstatistics. In contrast to classical coarse-graining, this compression is not\nbased on sacrificing temporal resolution, and brings memory-efficient,\nhigh-fidelity stochastic modelling within reach of present quantum\ntechnologies.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Currently, only behavioral speech understanding tests are\navailable, which require active participation of the person. As this is\ninfeasible for certain populations, an objective measure of speech\nintelligibility is required. Recently, brain imaging data has been used to\nestablish a relationship between stimulus and brain response. Linear models\nhave been successfully linked to speech intelligibility but require per-subject\ntraining. We present a deep-learning-based model incorporating dilated\nconvolutions that can be used to predict speech intelligibility without\nsubject-specific (re)training. Methods: We evaluated the performance of the\nmodel as a function of input segment length, EEG frequency band and receptive\nfield size while comparing it to a baseline model. Next, we evaluated\nperformance on held-out data and finetuning. Finally, we established a link\nbetween the accuracy of our model and the state-of-the-art behavioral MATRIX\ntest. Results: The model significantly outperformed the baseline for every\ninput segment length (p$\\leq10^{-9}$), for all EEG frequency bands except the\ntheta band (p$\\leq0.001$) and for receptive field sizes larger than 125~ms\n(p$\\leq0.05$). Additionally, finetuning significantly increased the accuracy\n(p$\\leq0.05$) on a held-out dataset. Finally, a significant correlation\n(r=0.59, p=0.0154) was found between the speech reception threshold estimated\nusing the behavioral MATRIX test and our objective method. Conclusion: Our\nproposed dilated convolutional model can be used as a proxy for speech\nintelligibility. Significance: Our method is the first to predict the speech\nreception threshold from EEG for unseen subjects, contributing to objective\nmeasures of speech intelligibility.",

However, it is difficult to produce high-quality arbitrary view\nsynthetic X-ray images in real-time due to limited CT scanning resolution, high\ncomputation resource demand or algorithm complexity. Our goal is to generate\nhigh-resolution synthetic X-ray images in real-time by upsampling\nlow-resolution im-ages. Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) has been well\nstudied in recent years and has been proven to be more powerful than\ntraditional Single Image Su-per-Resolution (SISR). RefSR can produce fine\ndetails by utilizing the reference image but it still inevitably generates some\nartifacts and noise. In this paper, we propose texture transformer\nsuper-resolution with frequency domain (TTSR-FD). We introduce frequency domain\nloss as a constraint to further improve the quality of the RefSR results with\nfine details and without obvious artifacts. This makes a real-time synthetic\nX-ray image-guided procedure VR simulation system possible. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first paper utilizing the frequency domain as part of\nthe loss functions in the field of super-resolution. We evaluated TTSR-FD on\nour synthetic X-ray image dataset and achieved state-of-the-art results.",

Based on measured acoustic paths to predict\nthe sound pressure generated by external sources and the headphone at the ear\ndrum, the FIR filter coefficients of the ANC controller are optimized for\ndifferent sound fields. Due to the acoustic feedback path between the\nloudspeaker and the microphone, a stability constraint based on the Nyquist\nstability criterion is introduced. Performance degradations due to reinsertions\nof the headphone and intra-subject variations are addressed by simultaneously\noptimizing the controller for several measurement repetitions of the acoustic\npaths. Simulations show that the controller optimized for an ipsilateral\nexcitation produces an attenuation of at least -10 dB that extends\napproximately to +45{\\deg} and -65{\\deg} from the ipsilateral DoA. The\ncontroller optimized for a diffuse-field excitation achieves an attenuation of\nat least -10 dB over a wider range of DoAs on the ipsilateral side, namely\n+90{\\deg} to -90{\\deg}. Optimizing the controller for several measurement\nrepetitions is shown to be effective against performance degradations due to\nreinsertions and intra-subject variations.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic data generation is of great interest in diverse applications, such\nas for privacy protection. Deep generative models, such as variational\nautoencoders (VAEs), are a popular approach for creating such synthetic\ndatasets from original data. Despite the success of VAEs, there are limitations\nwhen it comes to the bimodal and skewed marginal distributions. These deviate\nfrom the unimodal symmetric distributions that are encouraged by the normality\nassumption typically used for the latent representations in VAEs. While there\nare extensions that assume other distributions for the latent space, this does\nnot generally increase flexibility for data with many different distributions.\nTherefore, we propose a novel method, pre-transformation variational\nautoencoders (PTVAEs), to specifically address bimodal and skewed data, by\nemploying pre-transformations at the level of original variables. Two types of\ntransformations are used to bring the data close to a normal distribution by a\nseparate parameter optimization for each variable in a dataset. We compare the\nperformance of our method with other state-of-the-art methods for synthetic\ndata generation. In addition to the visual comparison, we use a utility\nmeasurement for a quantitative evaluation. The results show that the PTVAE\napproach can outperform others in both bimodal and skewed data generation.\nFurthermore, the simplicity of the approach makes it usable in combination with\nother extensions of VAE.",
