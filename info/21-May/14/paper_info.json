    "title": "Orienting, Framing, Bridging, Magic, and Counseling: How Data Scientists  Navigate the Outer Loop of Client Collaborations in Industry and Academia",
    "abstract": "Data scientists often collaborate with clients to analyze data to meet a\nclient's needs. What does the end-to-end workflow of a data scientist's\ncollaboration with clients look like throughout the lifetime of a project? To\ninvestigate this question, we interviewed ten data scientists (5 female, 4\nmale, 1 non-binary) in diverse roles across industry and academia. We\ndiscovered that they work with clients in a six-stage outer-loop workflow,\nwhich involves 1) laying groundwork by building trust before a project begins,\n2) orienting to the constraints of the client's environment, 3) collaboratively\nframing the problem, 4) bridging the gap between data science and domain\nexpertise, 5) the inner loop of technical data analysis work, 6) counseling to\nhelp clients emotionally cope with analysis results. This novel outer-loop\nworkflow contributes to CSCW by expanding the notion of what collaboration\nmeans in data science beyond the widely-known inner-loop technical workflow\nstages of acquiring, cleaning, analyzing, modeling, and visualizing data. We\nconclude by discussing the implications of our findings for data science\neducation, parallels to design work, and unmet needs for tool development.",

    "abstract": "The research field of Embodied AI has witnessed substantial progress in\nvisual navigation and exploration thanks to powerful simulating platforms and\nthe availability of 3D data of indoor and photorealistic environments. These\ntwo factors have opened the doors to a new generation of intelligent agents\ncapable of achieving nearly perfect PointGoal Navigation. However, such\narchitectures are commonly trained with millions, if not billions, of frames\nand tested in simulation. Together with great enthusiasm, these results yield a\nquestion: how many researchers will effectively benefit from these advances? In\nthis work, we detail how to transfer the knowledge acquired in simulation into\nthe real world. To that end, we describe the architectural discrepancies that\ndamage the Sim2Real adaptation ability of models trained on the Habitat\nsimulator and propose a novel solution tailored towards the deployment in\nreal-world scenarios. We then deploy our models on a LoCoBot, a Low-Cost Robot\nequipped with a single Intel RealSense camera. Different from previous work,\nour testing scene is unavailable to the agent in simulation. The environment is\nalso inaccessible to the agent beforehand, so it cannot count on scene-specific\nsemantic priors. In this way, we reproduce a setting in which a research group\n(potentially from other fields) needs to employ the agent visual navigation\ncapabilities as-a-Service. Our experiments indicate that it is possible to\nachieve satisfying results when deploying the obtained model in the real world.\nOur code and models are available at https://github.com/aimagelab/LoCoNav.",

    "abstract": "Given an arbitrary matrix $A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$, we consider the\nfundamental problem of computing $Ax$ for any $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $Ax$\nis $s$-sparse. While fast algorithms exist for particular choices of $A$, such\nas the discrete Fourier transform, there is currently no $o(n^2)$ algorithm\nthat treats the unstructured case. In this paper, we devise a randomized\napproach to tackle the unstructured case. Our method relies on a representation\nof $A$ in terms of certain real-valued mutually unbiased bases derived from\nKerdock sets. In the preprocessing phase of our algorithm, we compute this\nrepresentation of $A$ in $O(n^3\\log n)$ operations. Next, given any unit vector\n$x\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $Ax$ is $s$-sparse, our randomized fast transform\nuses this representation of $A$ to compute the entrywise $\\epsilon$-hard\nthreshold of $Ax$ with high probability in only $O(sn +\n\\epsilon^{-2}\\|A\\|_{2\\to\\infty}^2n\\log n)$ operations.

    "title": "A Graph Neural Network Approach for Product Relationship Prediction",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks have revolutionized many machine learning tasks in\nrecent years, ranging from drug discovery, recommendation systems, image\nclassification, social network analysis to natural language understanding. This\npaper shows their efficacy in modeling relationships between products and\nmaking predictions for unseen product networks. By representing products as\nnodes and their relationships as edges of a graph, we show how an inductive\ngraph neural network approach, named GraphSAGE, can efficiently learn\ncontinuous representations for nodes and edges. These representations also\ncapture product feature information such as price, brand, or engineering\nattributes. They are combined with a classification model for predicting the\nexistence of the relationship between products. Using a case study of the\nChinese car market, we find that our method yields double the prediction\nperformance compared to an Exponential Random Graph Model-based method for\npredicting the co-consideration relationship between cars. While a vanilla\nGraphSAGE requires a partial network to make predictions, we introduce an\n`adjacency prediction model' to circumvent this limitation. This enables us to\npredict product relationships when no neighborhood information is known.\nFinally, we demonstrate how a permutation-based interpretability analysis can\nprovide insights on how design attributes impact the predictions of\nrelationships between products. This work provides a systematic method to\npredict the relationships between products in many different markets.",

    "abstract": "Although board games and video games have been studied for decades in\nartificial intelligence research, challenging word games remain relatively\nunexplored. Word games are not as constrained as games like chess or poker.\nInstead, word game strategy is defined by the players' understanding of the way\nwords relate to each other. The word game Codenames provides a unique\nopportunity to investigate common sense understanding of relationships between\nwords, an important open challenge. We propose an algorithm that can generate\nCodenames clues from the language graph BabelNet or from any of several\nembedding methods - word2vec, GloVe, fastText or BERT. We introduce a new\nscoring function that measures the quality of clues, and we propose a weighting\nterm called DETECT that incorporates dictionary-based word representations and\ndocument frequency to improve clue selection. We develop BabelNet-Word\nSelection Framework (BabelNet-WSF) to improve BabelNet clue quality and\novercome the computational barriers that previously prevented leveraging\nlanguage graphs for Codenames. Extensive experiments with human evaluators\ndemonstrate that our proposed innovations yield state-of-the-art performance,\nwith up to 102.8% improvement in precision@2 in some cases.

    "abstract": "Research in sociology and linguistics shows that people use language not only\nto express their own identity but to understand the identity of others. Recent\nwork established a connection between expression of identity and emoji usage on\nsocial media, through use of emoji skin tone modifiers. Motivated by that\nfinding, this work asks if, as with language, readers are sensitive to such\nacts of self-expression and use them to understand the identity of authors. In\nbehavioral experiments (n=488), where text and emoji content of social media\nposts were carefully controlled before being presented to participants, we find\nin the affirmative -- emoji are a salient signal of author identity. That\nsignal is distinct from, and complementary to, the one encoded in language.\nParticipant groups (based on self-identified ethnicity) showed no differences\nin how they perceive this signal, except in the case of the default yellow\nemoji. While both groups associate this with a White identity, the effect was\nstronger in White participants. Our finding that emoji can index social\nvariables will have experimental applications for researchers but also\nimplications for designers: supposedly ``neutral`` defaults may be more\nrepresentative of some users than others.",

    "abstract": "Intracranial hemorrhage occurs when blood vessels rupture or leak within the\nbrain tissue or elsewhere inside the skull. It can be caused by physical trauma\nor by various medical conditions and in many cases leads to death. The\ntreatment must be started as soon as possible, and therefore the hemorrhage\nshould be diagnosed accurately and quickly. The diagnosis is usually performed\nby a radiologist who analyses a Computed Tomography (CT) scan containing a\nlarge number of cross-sectional images throughout the brain. Analysing each\nimage manually can be very time-consuming, but automated techniques can help\nspeed up the process. While much of the recent research has focused on solving\nthis problem by using supervised machine learning algorithms,\npublicly-available training data remains scarce due to privacy concerns. This\nproblem can be alleviated by unsupervised algorithms. In this paper, we propose\na fully-unsupervised algorithm which is based on the mixture models. Our\nalgorithm utilizes the fact that the properties of hemorrhage and healthy\ntissues follow different distributions, and therefore an appropriate\nformulation of these distributions allows us to separate them through an\nExpectation-Maximization process. In addition, our algorithm is able to\nadaptively determine the number of clusters such that all the hemorrhage\nregions can be found without including noisy voxels. We demonstrate the results\nof our algorithm on publicly-available datasets that contain all different\nhemorrhage types in various sizes and intensities, and our results are compared\nto earlier unsupervised and supervised algorithms. The results show that our\nalgorithm can outperform the other algorithms with most hemorrhage types.",

An accurate\nprediction with a 30, 60, or 90 minute prediction horizon has the potential of\nsaving millions of dollars in emergency care costs. In this paper, we treat the\nproblem as one of function approximation, where the value of the BG level at\ntime $t+h$ (where $h$ the prediction horizon) is considered to be an unknown\nfunction of $d$ readings prior to the time $t$. This unknown function may be\nsupported in particular on some unknown submanifold of the $d$-dimensional\nEuclidean space. While manifold learning is classically done in a\nsemi-supervised setting, where the entire data has to be known in advance, we\nuse recent ideas to achieve an accurate function approximation in a supervised\nsetting; i.e., construct a model for the target function.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a unified batch-online learning approach is introduced to\nlearn a linear representation of nonlinear system dynamics using the Koopman\noperator. The presented system modeling approach leverages a novel incremental\nKoopman-based update law that retrieves a mini-batch of samples stored in a\nmemory to not only minimizes the instantaneous Koopman operator's\nidentification errors but also the identification errors for the batch of\nretrieved samples. Discontinuous modifications of gradient flows are presented\nfor the online update law to assure finite-time convergence under\neasy-to-verify conditions defined on the batch of data. Therefore, this unified\nonline-batch framework allows performing joint sample- and time-domain analysis\nfor converging the Koopman operator's parameters. More specifically, it is\nshown that if the collected mini-batch of samples guarantees a rank condition,\nthen finite-time guarantee in the time domain can be certified and the settling\ntime depends on the quality of collected samples being reused in the update\nlaw. Moreover, the efficiency of the proposed Koopman-based update law is\nfurther analyzed by showing that the identification regret in continuous time\ngrows sub-linearly with time. Furthermore, to avoid learning corrupted dynamics\ndue to the selection of an inappropriate set of Koopman observables, a\nhigher-layer meta learner employs a discrete Bayesian optimization algorithm to\nobtain the best library of observable functions for the operator. Since\nfinite-time convergence of the Koopman model for each set of observable is\nguaranteed under a rank condition on stored data, the fitness of each set of\nobservables can be obtained based on the identification error on the stored\nsamples in the proposed framework and even without implementing any controller\nbased on the learned system.",

    "abstract": "The paper studies distributed binary hypothesis testing over a two-hop\nnetwork where both the relay and the receiver decide on the hypothesis. Both\ncommunication links are subject to expected rate constraints, which differs\nfrom the classical assumption of maximum rate constraints. We exactly\ncharacterize the set of type-II error exponent pairs at the relay and the\nreceiver when both type-I error probabilities are constrained by the same value\n$\\epsilon>0$. No tradeoff is observed between the two exponents, i.e., one can\nsimultaneously attain maximum type-II error exponents both at the relay and at\nthe receiver. For $\\epsilon_1 \\neq \\epsilon_2$, we present an achievable\nexponents region, which we obtain with a scheme that applies different versions\nof a basic two-hop scheme, which is shown to be optimal in previous works under\nmaximum rate constraints. More specifically, the basic two-hop scheme is used\nin our scheme with two choices of parameters and rates, depending on the\ntransmitter's observed sequence. For $\\epsilon_1=\\epsilon_2$ a single choice is\nshown to be sufficient. Numerical simulations indicate that extending to three\nor more parameter choices is never beneficial.",

Input\nitems have sizes, and they also belong to a certain number of types. The new\nconcept deals with the comparison of optimal solutions for the cases where\nitems of distinct types can and cannot be packed together, respectively. The\nproblem is related to greedy bin packing algorithms and to batched bin packing,\nand we discuss some of those concepts as well. We analyze max-OEBP, where a\npacked bin is valid if by excluding its largest item, the total size of items\nis below 1. For this variant, we study the case of general item sizes, and the\nparametric case with bounded item sizes, which shows the effect of small items.\nFinally, we briefly discuss min-OEBP, where a bin is valid if the total size of\nits items excluding the smallest item is below 1, which is known to be an\nentirely different problem.",

    "abstract": "Training a neural network model for recognizing multiple labels associated\nwith an image, including identifying unseen labels, is challenging, especially\nfor images that portray numerous semantically diverse labels. As challenging as\nthis task is, it is an essential task to tackle since it represents many\nreal-world cases, such as image retrieval of natural images. We argue that\nusing a single embedding vector to represent an image, as commonly practiced,\nis not sufficient to rank both relevant seen and unseen labels accurately. This\nstudy introduces an end-to-end model training for multi-label zero-shot\nlearning that supports semantic diversity of the images and labels. We propose\nto use an embedding matrix having principal embedding vectors trained using a\ntailored loss function. In addition, during training, we suggest up-weighting\nin the loss function image samples presenting higher semantic diversity to\nencourage the diversity of the embedding matrix. Extensive experiments show\nthat our proposed method improves the zero-shot model's quality in tag-based\nimage retrieval achieving SoTA results on several common datasets (NUS-Wide,\nCOCO, Open Images).",

    "abstract": "Video streaming platforms such as Youtube, Twitch, and DLive allow users to\nlive-stream video content for viewers who can optionally express their\nappreciation through monetary donations. DLive is one of the smaller and\nlesser-known streaming platforms, and historically has had fewer content\nmoderation practices. It has thus become a popular place for violent extremists\nand other clandestine groups to earn money and propagandize. What is the\nfinancial structure of the DLive streaming ecosystem and how much money is\nchanging hands? In the past it has been difficult to understand how far-right\nextremists fundraise via podcasts and video streams because of the secretive\nnature of the activity and because of the difficulty of getting data from\nsocial media platforms. This paper describes a novel experiment to collect and\nanalyze data from DLive's publicly available ledgers of transactions in order\nto understand the financial structure of the clandestine, extreme far-right\nvideo streaming community. The main findings of this paper are, first, that the\nmajority of donors are using micropayments in varying frequencies, but a small\nhandful of donors spend large amounts of money to finance their favorite\nstreamers. Next, the timing of donations to high-profile far-right streamers\nfollows a fairly predictable pattern that is closely tied to a broadcast\nschedule. Finally, the far-right video streaming financial landscape is divided\ninto separate cliques which exhibit very little crossover in terms of sizable\ndonations. This work will be important to technology companies, policymakers,\nand researchers who are trying to understand how niche social media services,\nincluding video platforms, are being exploited by extremists to propagandize\nand fundraise.",

Even though large neural networks are more powerful than simpler\nstatistical models, they are especially hard to train on small datasets. This\npaper not only presents a model with grater flexibility than the other proposed\nneural networks, but also presents a model that is effective on smaller\ndatasets. To improve performance on small data, six regularisation methods were\ntested. The results show that the GRU combined with 20% Dropout achieved the\nlowest RMSE scores.

MWBDs are diverse and\ninclude various injectable, ingestible, implantable, and wearable devices.\nWhile the growth of MWBDs increases the flexibility of medical services, the\nadoption of these technologies brings privacy and security risks for their\nusers. MWBDs can operate with sensitive, private information and affect\npatients through the use of stimulation and drug delivery. Therefore, these\ndevices require trust and need to be secure. Embedding protective mechanisms\ninto MWBDs is challenging because they are restricted in size, power budget, as\nwell as processing and storage capabilities. Nevertheless, MWBDs need to be at\nleast minimally securable in the face of evolving threats. The main intent of\nthis work is to make the primary stakeholders of MWBDs aware of associated\nrisks and to help the architects and the manufacturers of MWBDs protect their\nemerging designs in a repeatable and structured manner. Making MWBDs securable\nbegins with performing threat modeling. This paper introduces a domain-specific\nqualitative-quantitative threat model dedicated to MWBDs.

    "abstract": "Sequential information contains short- to long-range dependencies; however,\nlearning long-timescale information has been a challenge for recurrent neural\nnetworks. Despite improvements in long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), the\nforgetting mechanism results in the exponential decay of information, limiting\ntheir capacity to capture long-timescale information. Here, we propose a power\nlaw forget gate, which instead learns to forget information along a slower\npower law decay function. Specifically, the new gate learns to control the\npower law decay factor, p, allowing the network to adjust the information decay\nrate according to task demands. Our experiments show that an LSTM with power\nlaw forget gates (pLSTM) can effectively capture long-range dependencies beyond\nhundreds of elements on image classification, language modeling, and\ncategorization tasks, improving performance over the vanilla LSTM. We also\ninspected the revised forget gate by varying the initialization of p, setting p\nto a fixed value, and ablating cells in the pLSTM network. The results show\nthat the information decay can be controlled by the learnable decay factor p,\nwhich allows pLSTM to achieve its superior performance. Altogether, we found\nthat LSTM with the proposed forget gate can learn long-term dependencies,\noutperforming other recurrent networks in multiple domains; such gating\nmechanism can be integrated into other architectures for improving the learning\nof long timescale information in recurrent neural networks.",

JuliaSim can build accelerated surrogates from component-based\nmodels, such as those conforming to the FMI standard, using continuous-time\necho state networks (CTESN). The foundation of this environment,\nModelingToolkit.jl, is an acausal modeling language which can compose the\ntrained surrogates as components within its staged compilation process. As a\ncomplementary factor we present the JuliaSim model library, a standard library\nwith differential-algebraic equations and pre-trained surrogates, which can be\ncomposed using the modeling system for design, optimization, and control. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the surrogate-accelerated modeling and\nsimulation approach on HVAC dynamics by showing that the CTESN surrogates\naccurately capture the dynamics of a HVAC cycle at less than 4\\% error while\naccelerating its simulation by 340x. We illustrate the use of surrogate\nacceleration in the design process via global optimization of simulation\nparameters using the embedded surrogate, yielding a speedup of two orders of\nmagnitude to find the optimum. We showcase the surrogate deployed in a\nco-simulation loop, as a drop-in replacement for one of the coupled FMUs,\nallowing engineers to effectively explore the design space of a coupled system.\nTogether this demonstrates a workflow for automating the integration of machine\nlearning techniques into traditional modeling and simulation processes.",

    "abstract": "The development of an automatic way to extract user opinions about products,\nmovies, and foods from online social network (OSN) interactions is among the\nmain interests of sentiment analysis and opinion mining studies. Existing\napproaches in the sentiment analysis domain mostly do not discriminate the\nsentences of different types of users, even though some users are always\nnegative and some are always positive. Thus, finding a way to identify these\ntwo types of user is significant because their attitudes can change the\nanalysis of user reviews of businesses and products. Due to the complexity of\nnatural language processing, pure text mining methods may lead to\nmisunderstandings about the exact nature of the sentiments expressed in review\ntext. In this study, we propose a neural network classifier to predict the\npresence of biased users on the basis of users' psychological behaviors. The\nidentification of the psychological behaviors of users allows us to find overly\npositive and overly negative users and to categorize these users' attitudes\nregardless of the content of their review texts.

In this architecture, processing and memory units are\nimplemented as separate blocks interchanging data intensively and continuously.\nThis data transfer is responsible for a large part of the power consumption.\nThe next generation computer technology is expected to solve problems at the\nexascale.

    "abstract": "Online stores often utilize product relationships such as bundles and\nsubstitutes to improve their catalog quality and guide customers through myriad\nchoices. Entity resolution using pairwise product matching models offers a\nmeans of inferring relationships between products. In mature data repositories,\nthe relationships may be mostly correct but require incremental improvements\nowing to errors in the original data or in the entity resolution system. It is\ncritical to devise incremental entity resolution (IER) approaches for improving\nthe health of relationships. However, most existing research on IER focuses on\nthe addition of new products or information into existing relationships.\nRelatively little research has been done for detecting low quality within\ncurrent relationships.\nThis paper proposes a novel method for identifying inconsistent clusters\n(IC), existing groups of related products that do not belong together. We\npropose to treat the identification of inconsistent clusters as a supervised\nlearning task which predicts whether a graph of products with similarities as\nweighted edges should be partitioned into multiple clusters. In this case, the\nproblem becomes a classification task on weighted graphs and represents an\ninteresting application area for modern tools such as Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs). We demonstrate that existing Message Passing neural networks perform\nwell at this task, exceeding traditional graph processing techniques.

    "abstract": "Modern processors can offer hardware primitives that allow a process to run\nin isolation. These primitives implement a trusted execution environment (TEE)\nin which a program can run such that the integrity and confidentiality of its\nexecution are guaranteed. Intel's Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) is an example\nof such primitives and its isolated processes are called \\emph{enclaves}. These\nguarantees, however, can be easily thwarted if the enclave has not been\nproperly designed. Its interface with the untrusted software stack is arguably\nthe largest attack surface that adversaries can exploit; unintended\ninteractions with untrusted code can expose the enclave to memory corruption\nattacks, for instance. In this paper, we propose a notion of an \\emph{orderly}\nenclave which splits its behaviour into several execution phases each of which\nimposes a set of restrictions on accesses to untrusted memory, phase\ntransitions and registers sanitisation. A violation to these restrictions\nindicates an undesired behaviour which could be harnessed to perpetrate attacks\nagainst the enclave. We also introduce \\Analyser{}: a tool that uses symbolic\nexecution to carry out the validation of an enclave against our notion of an\norderly enclave; in this process, it also looks for some typical\nmemory-corruption vulnerabilities. We discuss how our approach can prevent and\nflag enclave vulnerabilities that have been identified in the literature.\nMoreover, we have evaluated how our approach fares in the analysis of some\npractical enclaves. \\Analyser{} was able to identify real vulnerabilities on\nthese enclaves which have been acknowledged and fixed by their maintainers.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a unified framework to jointly model images, text, and human\nattention traces. Our work is built on top of the recent Localized Narratives\nannotation framework [30], where each word of a given caption is paired with a\nmouse trace segment. We propose two novel tasks: (1) predict a trace given an\nimage and caption (i.e., visual grounding), and (2) predict a caption and a\ntrace given only an image. Learning the grounding of each word is challenging,\ndue to noise in the human-provided traces and the presence of words that cannot\nbe meaningfully visually grounded. We present a novel model architecture that\nis jointly trained on dual tasks (controlled trace generation and controlled\ncaption generation). To evaluate the quality of the generated traces, we\npropose a local bipartite matching (LBM) distance metric which allows the\ncomparison of two traces of different lengths. Extensive experiments show our\nmodel is robust to the imperfect training data and outperforms the baselines by\na clear margin. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model pre-trained on the\nproposed tasks can be also beneficial to the downstream task of COCO's guided\nimage captioning.

    "abstract": "There is an increasing amount of evidence that in cases with little or no\ndata in a target language, training on a different language can yield\nsurprisingly good results. However, currently there are no established\nguidelines for choosing the training (source) language. In attempt to solve\nthis issue we thoroughly analyze a state-of-the-art multilingual model and try\nto determine what impacts good transfer between languages. As opposed to the\nmajority of multilingual NLP literature, we don't only train on English, but on\na group of almost 30 languages. We show that looking at particular syntactic\nfeatures is 2-4 times more helpful in predicting the performance than an\naggregated syntactic similarity. We find out that the importance of syntactic\nfeatures strongly differs depending on the downstream task - no single feature\nis a good performance predictor for all NLP tasks. As a result, one should not\nexpect that for a target language $L_1$ there is a single language $L_2$ that\nis the best choice for any NLP task (for instance, for Bulgarian, the best\nsource language is French on POS tagging, Russian on NER and Thai on NLI).

    "abstract": "Software developers often rely on natural language text that appears in\nsoftware engineering artifacts to access critical information as they build and\nwork on software systems. For example, developers access requirements documents\nto understand what to build, comments in source code to understand design\ndecisions, answers to questions on Q&A sites to understand APIs, and so on. To\naid software developers in accessing and using this natural language\ninformation, software engineering researchers often use techniques from natural\nlanguage processing. In this paper, we explore whether frame semantics, a\ngeneral linguistic approach, which has been used on requirements text, can also\nhelp address problems that occur when applying lexicon analysis based\ntechniques to text associated with program comprehension activities. We assess\nthe applicability of generic semantic frame parsing for this purpose, and based\non the results, we propose SEFrame to tailor semantic frame parsing for program\ncomprehension uses. We evaluate the correctness and robustness of the approach\nfinding that SEFrame is correct in between 73% and 74% of the cases and that it\ncan parse text from a variety of software artifacts used to support program\ncomprehension.

    "title": "Sparse Nonnegative Convolution Is Equivalent to Dense Nonnegative  Convolution",
    "abstract": "Computing the convolution $A\\star B$ of two length-$n$ vectors $A,B$ is an\nubiquitous computational primitive. Applications range from string problems to\nKnapsack-type problems, and from 3SUM to All-Pairs Shortest Paths. These\napplications often come in the form of nonnegative convolution, where the\nentries of $A,B$ are nonnegative integers. The classical algorithm to compute\n$A\\star B$ uses the Fast Fourier Transform and runs in time $O(n\\log n)$.\nHowever, often $A$ and $B$ satisfy sparsity conditions, and hence one could\nhope for significant improvements. The ideal goal is an $O(k\\log k)$-time\nalgorithm, where $k$ is the number of non-zero elements in the output, i.e.,\nthe size of the support of $A\\star B$. This problem is referred to as sparse\nnonnegative convolution, and has received considerable attention in the\nliterature; the fastest algorithms to date run in time $O(k\\log^2 n)$.\nThe main result of this paper is the first $O(k\\log k)$-time algorithm for\nsparse nonnegative convolution. Our algorithm is randomized and assumes that\nthe length $n$ and the largest entry of $A$ and $B$ are subexponential in $k$.\nSurprisingly, we can phrase our algorithm as a reduction from the sparse case\nto the dense case of nonnegative convolution, showing that, under some mild\nassumptions, sparse nonnegative convolution is equivalent to dense nonnegative\nconvolution for constant-error randomized algorithms. Specifically, if $D(n)$\nis the time to convolve two nonnegative length-$n$ vectors with success\nprobability $2/3$, and $S(k)$ is the time to convolve two nonnegative vectors\nwith output size $k$ with success probability $2/3$, then\n$S(k)=O(D(k)+k(\\log\\log k)^2)$.\nOur approach uses a variety of new techniques in combination with some old\nmachinery from linear sketching and structured linear algebra, as well as new\ninsights on linear hashing, the most classical hash function.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has unveiled a theory for reasoning about the decisions made by\nbinary classifiers: a classifier describes a Boolean function, and the reasons\nbehind an instance being classified as positive are the prime-implicants of the\nfunction that are satisfied by the instance. One drawback of these works is\nthat they do not explicitly treat scenarios where the underlying data is known\nto be constrained, e.g., certain combinations of features may not exist, may\nnot be observable, or may be required to be disregarded. We propose a more\ngeneral theory, also based on prime-implicants, tailored to taking constraints\ninto account. The main idea is to view classifiers in the presence of\nconstraints as describing partial Boolean functions, i.e., that are undefined\non instances that do not satisfy the constraints. We prove that this simple\nidea results in reasons that are no less (and sometimes more) succinct. That\nis, not taking constraints into account (e.g., ignored, or taken as negative\ninstances) results in reasons that are subsumed by reasons that do take\nconstraints into account. We illustrate this improved parsimony on synthetic\nclassifiers and classifiers learned from real data.",

    "abstract": "A popular method of improving the throughput of blockchain systems is by\nrunning smaller side blockchains that push the hashes of their blocks onto a\ntrusted blockchain. Side blockchains are vulnerable to stalling attacks where a\nside blockchain node pushes the hash of a block to the trusted blockchain but\nmakes the block unavailable to other nodes in the side blockchain. Recently,\nSheng et al. proposed a data availability oracle based on LDPC codes and a data\ndispersal protocol as a solution to the above problem. While showing great\nimprovements, the codes and the dispersal protocol were designed disjointly\nfrom each other which may not be optimal in terms of the communication cost\nassociated with the oracle. In this paper, we provide a tailored dispersal\nprotocol and a specialized LDPC code construction based on the Progressive Edge\nGrowth (PEG) algorithm called the dispersal-efficient PEG (DE-PEG) algorithm\naimed to reduce the communication cost associated with the new dispersal\nprotocol. Our new code construction reduces the communication cost, and\nadditionally, is less restrictive in terms of system design.",

    "abstract": "We study Bayesian automated mechanism design in unstructured dynamic\nenvironments, where a principal repeatedly interacts with an agent, and takes\nactions based on the strategic agent's report of the current state of the\nworld. Both the principal and the agent can have arbitrary and potentially\ndifferent valuations for the actions taken, possibly also depending on the\nactual state of the world. Moreover, at any time, the state of the world may\nevolve arbitrarily depending on the action taken by the principal. The goal is\nto compute an optimal mechanism which maximizes the principal's utility in the\nface of the self-interested strategic agent.\nWe give an efficient algorithm for computing optimal mechanisms, with or\nwithout payments, under different individual-rationality constraints, when the\ntime horizon is constant. Our algorithm is based on a sophisticated linear\nprogram formulation, which can be customized in various ways to accommodate\nricher constraints. For environments with large time horizons, we show that the\nprincipal's optimal utility is hard to approximate within a certain constant\nfactor, complementing our algorithmic result. We further consider a special\ncase of the problem where the agent is myopic, and give a refined efficient\nalgorithm whose time complexity scales linearly in the time horizon. Moreover,\nwe show that memoryless mechanisms do not provide a good solution for our\nproblem, in terms of both optimality and computational tractability. These\nresults paint a relatively complete picture for automated dynamic mechanism\ndesign in unstructured environments.

    "abstract": "Enterprise information systems allow companies to maintain detailed records\nof their business process executions. These records can be extracted in the\nform of event logs, which capture the execution of activities across multiple\ninstances of a business process. Event logs may be used to analyze business\nprocesses at a fine level of detail using process mining techniques. Among\nother things, process mining techniques allow us to discover a process model\nfrom an event log -- an operation known as automated process discovery. Despite\na rich body of research in the field, existing automated process discovery\ntechniques do not fully capture the concurrency inherent in a business process.\nSpecifically, the bulk of these techniques treat two activities A and B as\nconcurrent if sometimes A completes before B and other times B completes before\nA.

This paper addresses this gap by presenting a refined version of an\nautomated process discovery technique, namely Split Miner, that discovers true\nconcurrency relations from event logs containing start and end timestamps for\neach activity. The proposed technique is also able to differentiate between\nexclusive and inclusive choices.

    "abstract": "Recovering badly damaged face images is a useful yet challenging task,\nespecially in extreme cases where the masked or damaged region is very large.\nOne of the major challenges is the ability of the system to generalize on faces\noutside the training dataset. We propose to tackle this extreme inpainting task\nwith a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that utilizes\nstructural information, such as edges, as a prior condition. Edge information\ncan be obtained from the partially masked image and a structurally similar\nimage or a hand drawing. In our proposed conditional GAN, we pass the\nconditional input in every layer of the encoder while maintaining consistency\nin the distributions between the learned weights and the incoming conditional\ninput. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with badly damaged face\nexamples.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been popularly used in analyzing\ngraph-structured data, showing promising results in various applications such\nas node classification, link prediction and network recommendation. In this\npaper, we present a new graph attention neural network, namely GIPA, for\nattributed graph data learning. GIPA consists of three key components:\nattention, feature propagation and aggregation. Specifically, the attention\ncomponent introduces a new multi-layer perceptron based multi-head to generate\nbetter non-linear feature mapping and representation than conventional\nimplementations such as dot-product. The propagation component considers not\nonly node features but also edge features, which differs from existing GNNs\nthat merely consider node features. The aggregation component uses a residual\nconnection to generate the final embedding. We evaluate the performance of GIPA\nusing the Open Graph Benchmark proteins (ogbn-proteins for short) dataset. The\nexperimental results reveal that GIPA can beat the state-of-the-art models in\nterms of prediction accuracy, e.g., GIPA achieves an average ROC-AUC of\n$0.8700\\pm 0.0010$ and outperforms all the previous methods listed in the\nogbn-proteins leaderboard.",

Existing\nsystems use the same embedding model to compute representations (embeddings)\nfor the query and gallery images. Such systems inherently face a hard\naccuracy-efficiency trade-off: the embedding model needs to be large enough to\nensure high accuracy, yet small enough to enable query-embedding computation on\nresource-constrained platforms. This trade-off could be mitigated if gallery\nembeddings are generated from a large model and query embeddings are extracted\nusing a compact model. The key to building such a system is to ensure\nrepresentation compatibility between the query and gallery models.

The other by modifying\nthe architectures that compute the embeddings, leading to compatibility-aware\nneural architecture search (CMP-NAS). We test CMP-NAS on challenging retrieval\ntasks for fashion images (DeepFashion2), and face images (IJB-C). Compared to\nordinary (homogeneous) visual search using the largest embedding model\n(paragon), CMP-NAS achieves 80-fold and 23-fold cost reduction while\nmaintaining accuracy within 0.3% and 1.6% of the paragon on DeepFashion2 and\nIJB-C respectively.",

High-precision\ntime synchronization communications, such as Time Triggered Ethernet (TTE),\nhave been successfully developed for wired networks. However, the high cost of\ndeploying additional equipment and extra wiring limits the scalability of these\nnetworks. Therefore, in this paper, a hybrid wired/wireless high-precision time\nsynchronization network based on a combination of high-speed TTE and 5G\nUltra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) is proposed. The main\nmotivation is to comply with the low latency, low jitter, and high reliability\nrequirements of time critical applications, such as smart grid synchrophasor\ncommunications. Therefore, in the proposed hybrid network architecture, a\nhigh-speed TTE is considered as the main bus (i.e., backbone network), whereas\na Precision Time Protocol (PTP) aided 5G-URLLC-based wireless access is used as\na sub-network. The main challenge is to achieve interoperability between the\nPTP aided URLLC and the TTE, while ensuring high precision timing and\nsynchronization.

    "abstract": "As an enhanced version of Random Testing (RT), Adaptive Random Testing (ART)\naims to improve the failure detection effectiveness of RT by distributing the\ntest cases more evenly in the input domain. Many ART algorithms have been\nproposed based on different criteria. Among them, the Fixed-Size-Candidate-Set\nART (FSCS-ART) is one of the most effective and classical algorithms. FSCS-ART\nensures high failure detection effectiveness using selecting the candidate test\ncase which farthest from the previously executed test cases as the next test\ncase. Although FSCS-ART has good failure detection effectiveness, it also has\nsome drawbacks, such as computational overhead problem. In this paper, we\npropose an enhanced version of FSCS-ART, namely Vantage Point Partitioning\nStrategy based ART (VPPS-ART). VPPS-ART attempts to solve the computational\noverhead problem of FSCS-ART using vantage point partitioning strategy and\nensures the failure detection effectiveness of FSCS-ART. VPPS-ART achieves the\npartitioning of the input domain space by using a Vantage Point tree (VP-tree)\nand finds the nearest executed test cases of a candidate test case in the\npartitioned sub-domains, which reduces the time overhead significantly compared\nto the entire input domain search computation. Besides, to match the dynamic\ninsertion process of FSCS-ART, we modify the structure of the traditional\nVP-tree to support dynamic data. The simulation results present that VPPS-ART\nhas a great lower time overhead compared to FSCS-ART, and also guarantees\nsimilar or better failure detection effectiveness than FSCS-ART. The VPPS-ART\nalso shows strength in comparison with the KDFC-ART algorithms, a series of\nenhanced ART algorithms based on KD-tree.

For example, a health-monitoring system that is designed under the\nassumption that weight is reported in imperial units (lbs) will malfunction\nwhen encountering weight reported in metric units (kilograms). Similar to\nsoftware debugging, which aims to find bugs in the mechanism (source code or\nruntime conditions), our goal is to debug the data to identify potential\nsources of disconnect between the assumptions about the data and the systems\nthat operate on that data. Specifically, we seek which properties of the data\ncause a data-driven system to malfunction.

Such\nidentification is necessary to repair the system and resolve the disconnect\nbetween data and system. Our technique is based on causal reasoning through\ninterventions: when a system malfunctions for a dataset, DataExposer alters the\ndata profiles and observes changes in the system's behavior due to the\nalteration. Unlike statistical observational analysis that reports mere\ncorrelations, DataExposer reports causally verified root causes, in terms of\ndata profiles, of the system malfunction.

    "abstract": "Recommender system usually faces popularity bias issues: from the data\nperspective, items exhibit uneven (long-tail) distribution on the interaction\nfrequency; from the method perspective, collaborative filtering methods are\nprone to amplify the bias by over-recommending popular items. It is undoubtedly\ncritical to consider popularity bias in recommender systems, and existing work\nmainly eliminates the bias effect. However, we argue that not all biases in the\ndata are bad -- some items demonstrate higher popularity because of their\nbetter intrinsic quality. Blindly pursuing unbiased learning may remove the\nbeneficial patterns in the data, degrading the recommendation accuracy and user\nsatisfaction.\nThis work studies an unexplored problem in recommendation -- how to leverage\npopularity bias to improve the recommendation accuracy. The key lies in two\naspects: how to remove the bad impact of popularity bias during training, and\nhow to inject the desired popularity bias in the inference stage that generates\ntop-K recommendations. This questions the causal mechanism of the\nrecommendation generation process. Along this line, we find that item\npopularity plays the role of confounder between the exposed items and the\nobserved interactions, causing the bad effect of bias amplification. To achieve\nour goal, we propose a new training and inference paradigm for recommendation\nnamed Popularity-bias Deconfounding and Adjusting (PDA). It removes the\nconfounding popularity bias in model training and adjusts the recommendation\nscore with desired popularity bias via causal intervention. We demonstrate the\nnew paradigm on latent factor model and perform extensive experiments on three\nreal-world datasets. Empirical studies validate that the deconfounded training\nis helpful to discover user real interests and the inference adjustment with\npopularity bias could further improve the recommendation accuracy.",

    "title": "Semi-Supervised Variational Reasoning for Medical Dialogue Generation",
    "abstract": "Medical dialogue generation aims to provide automatic and accurate responses\nto assist physicians to obtain diagnosis and treatment suggestions in an\nefficient manner. In medical dialogues two key characteristics are relevant for\nresponse generation: patient states (such as symptoms, medication) and\nphysician actions (such as diagnosis, treatments). In medical scenarios\nlarge-scale human annotations are usually not available, due to the high costs\nand privacy requirements. Hence, current approaches to medical dialogue\ngeneration typically do not explicitly account for patient states and physician\nactions, and focus on implicit representation instead. We propose an end-to-end\nvariational reasoning approach to medical dialogue generation. To be able to\ndeal with a limited amount of labeled data, we introduce both patient state and\nphysician action as latent variables with categorical priors for explicit\npatient state tracking and physician policy learning, respectively. We propose\na variational Bayesian generative approach to approximate posterior\ndistributions over patient states and physician actions. We use an efficient\nstochastic gradient variational Bayes estimator to optimize the derived\nevidence lower bound, where a 2-stage collapsed inference method is proposed to\nreduce the bias during model training. A physician policy network composed of\nan action-classifier and two reasoning detectors is proposed for augmented\nreasoning ability. We conduct experiments on three datasets collected from\nmedical platforms. Our experimental results show that the proposed method\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of objective and subjective\nevaluation metrics. Our experiments also indicate that our proposed\nsemi-supervised reasoning method achieves a comparable performance as\nstate-of-the-art fully supervised learning baselines for physician policy\nlearning.",

To\nillustrate the power of these geometry-aware methods and their corresponding\nnon-uniform analysis, we consider two important problems in machine learning:\npolicy gradient optimization in reinforcement learning (PG), and generalized\nlinear model training in supervised learning (GLM). For PG, we find that\nnormalizing the gradient ascent method can accelerate convergence to\n$O(e^{-t})$ while incurring less overhead than existing algorithms.

    "abstract": "Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols are traditionally\ndeveloped to support reliable distributed computing. For applications where the\nprotocol participants are economic agents, recent works highlighted the\nimportance of accountability: the ability to identify participants who provably\nviolate the protocol. We propose to evaluate the security of an accountable\nprotocol in terms of its liveness resilience, the minimum number of Byzantine\nnodes when liveness is violated, and its accountable safety resilience, the\nminimum number of accountable Byzantine nodes when safety is violated. We\ncharacterize the optimal tradeoffs between these two resiliences in different\nnetwork environments, and identify an availability-accountability dilemma: in\nan environment with dynamic participation, no protocol can simultaneously be\naccountably-safe and live. We provide a resolution to this dilemma by\nconstructing an optimally-resilient accountability gadget to checkpoint a\nlongest chain protocol, such that the full ledger is live under dynamic\nparticipation and the checkpointed prefix ledger is accountable. Our\naccountability gadget construction is black-box and can use any BFT protocol\nwhich is accountable under static participation. Using HotStuff as the black\nbox, we implemented our construction as a protocol for the Ethereum 2.0 beacon\nchain, and our Internet-scale experiments with more than 4000 nodes show that\nthe protocol can achieve the required scalability and has better latency than\nthe current solution Gasper, while having the advantage of being provably\nsecure.

    "abstract": "The idea of using a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) consisting of a\nlarge array of passive scattering elements to assist wireless communication\nsystems has recently attracted much attention from academia and industry. A\ncentral issue with RIS is how much power they can effectively convey to the\ntarget radio nodes. Regarding this question, several power level models exist\nin the literature but few have been validated through experiments. In this\npaper, we propose a radar cross section-based received power model for an\nRIS-aided wireless communication system that is rooted in the physical\nproperties of RIS. Our proposed model follows the intuition that the received\npower is related to the distances from the transmitter/receiver to the RIS, the\nangles in the TX-RIS-RX triangle, the effective area of each element, and the\nreflection coefficient of each element. To the best of our knowledge, this\npaper is the first to model the angle-dependent phase shift of the reflection\ncoefficient, which is typically ignored in existing literature. We further\nmeasure the received power with our experimental platform in different\nscenarios to validate our model. The measurement results show that our model is\nappropriate both in near field and far field and can characterize the impact of\nangles well.",

    "abstract": "Contract element extraction (CEE) is the novel task of automatically\nidentifying and extracting legally relevant elements such as contract dates,\npayments, and legislation references from contracts. Automatic methods for this\ntask view it as a sequence labeling problem and dramatically reduce human\nlabor. However, as contract genres and element types may vary widely, a\nsignificant challenge for this sequence labeling task is how to transfer\nknowledge from one domain to another, i.e., cross-domain CEE. Cross-domain CEE\ndiffers from cross-domain named entity recognition (NER) in two important ways.\nFirst, contract elements are far more fine-grained than named entities, which\nhinders the transfer of extractors. Second, the extraction zones for\ncross-domain CEE are much larger than for cross-domain NER. As a result, the\ncontexts of elements from different domains can be more diverse. We propose a\nframework, the Bi-directional Feedback cLause-Element relaTion network\n(Bi-FLEET), for the cross-domain CEE task that addresses the above challenges.\nBi-FLEET has three main components: (1) a context encoder, (2) a clause-element\nrelation encoder, and (3) an inference layer. To incorporate invariant\nknowledge about element and clause types, a clause-element graph is constructed\nacross domains and a hierarchical graph neural network is adopted in the\nclause-element relation encoder. To reduce the influence of context variations,\na multi-task framework with a bi-directional feedback scheme is designed in the\ninference layer, conducting both clause classification and element extraction.\nThe experimental results over both cross-domain NER and CEE tasks show that\nBi-FLEET significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

While many deepfake detection models can detect\ndifferent types of deepfakes separately, they perform poorly on generalizing\nthe detection performance over multiple types of deepfake. This motivates us to\ndevelop a generalized model to detect different types of deepfakes. Therefore,\nin this work, we introduce a practical digital forensic tool to detect\ndifferent types of deepfakes simultaneously and propose Transfer learning-based\nAutoencoder with Residuals (TAR). The ultimate goal of our work is to develop a\nunified model to detect various types of deepfake videos with high accuracy,\nwith only a small number of training samples that can work well in real-world\nsettings.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a high-level circuit obfuscation technique to prevent the\ntheft of intellectual property (IP) of integrated circuits. In particular, our\ntechnique protects a class of circuits that relies on constant multiplications,\nsuch as filters and neural networks, where the constants themselves are the IP\nto be protected. By making use of decoy constants and a key-based scheme, a\nreverse engineer adversary at an untrusted foundry is rendered incapable of\ndiscerning true constants from decoy constants. The time-multiplexed constant\nmultiplication (TMCM) block of such circuits, which realizes the multiplication\nof an input variable by a constant at a time, is considered as our case study\nfor obfuscation. Furthermore, two TMCM design architectures are taken into\naccount; an implementation using a multiplier and a multiplierless shift-adds\nimplementation. Optimization methods are also applied to reduce the hardware\ncomplexity of these architectures. The well-known satisfiability (SAT) and\nautomatic test pattern generation (ATPG) attacks are used to determine the\nvulnerability of the obfuscated designs. It is observed that the proposed\ntechnique incurs small overheads in area, power, and delay that are comparable\nto the hardware complexity of prominent logic locking methods. Yet, the\nadvantage of our approach is in the insight that constants -- instead of\narbitrary circuit nodes -- become key-protected.",

    "abstract": "In distributed machine learning (DML), the training data is distributed\nacross multiple worker nodes to perform the underlying training in parallel.\nOne major problem affecting the performance of DML algorithms is presence of\nstragglers. These are nodes that are terribly slow in performing their task\nwhich results in under-utilization of the training data that is stored in them.\nTowards this, gradient coding mitigates the impact of stragglers by adding\nsufficient redundancy in the data. Gradient coding and other straggler\nmitigation schemes assume that the straggler behavior of the worker nodes is\nidentical. Our experiments on the Amazon AWS cluster however suggest otherwise\nand we see that there is a correlation in the straggler behavior across\niterations. To model this, we introduce a heterogeneous straggler model where\nnodes are categorized into two classes, slow and active. To better utilize\ntraining data stored with slow nodes, we modify the existing gradient coding\nschemes with shuffling of the training data among workers. Our results (both\nsimulation and cloud experiments) suggest remarkable improvement with shuffling\nover existing schemes.

To be\nspecific, we obtain the similarity confidence weights based on the initial\nnoisy similarity signals learned from local structures and construct a priority\nloss function for smooth similarity-preserving learning. Besides, global\ninformation based on clustering is utilized to distill the image pairs by\nremoving contradictory similarity signals.

Typically, the main\nobjective of automatic metro traffic regulation methods is to minimize the\ndelay time of trains while passengers' satisfaction is not considered. Instead,\nin this work, a novel framework that integrates a passenger flow module (PFM)\nand a train operation module (TOM) is proposed with the aim of simultaneously\nminimizing traffic delays and passengers' discomfort.

The two modules interact with each other so that the headway\ntime is automatically adjusted when a platform is overcrowded, and the train\ntraffic is immediately regulated according to the new headway time.

    "title": "The Dynamic k-Mismatch Problem",
    "abstract": "The text-to-pattern Hamming distances problem asks to compute the Hamming\ndistances between a given pattern of length $m$ and all length-$m$ substrings\nof a given text of length $n\\ge m$. We focus on the $k$-mismatch version of the\nproblem, where a distance needs to be returned only if it does not exceed a\nthreshold $k$. We assume $n\\le 2m$ (in general, one can partition the text into\noverlapping blocks). In this work, we show data structures for the dynamic\nversion of this problem supporting two operations: An update performs a\nsingle-letter substitution in the pattern or the text, and a query, given an\nindex $i$, returns the Hamming distance between the pattern and the text\nsubstring starting at position $i$, or reports that it exceeds $k$.\nFirst, we show a data structure with $\\tilde{O}(1)$ update and $\\tilde{O}(k)$\nquery time. Then we show that $\\tilde{O}(k)$ update and $\\tilde{O}(1)$ query\ntime is also possible. These two provide an optimal trade-off for the dynamic\n$k$-mismatch problem with $k \\le \\sqrt{n}$: we prove that, conditioned on the\nstrong 3SUM conjecture, one cannot simultaneously achieve $k^{1-\\Omega(1)}$\ntime for all operations.\nFor $k\\ge \\sqrt{n}$, we give another lower bound, conditioned on the Online\nMatrix-Vector conjecture, that excludes algorithms taking $n^{1/2-\\Omega(1)}$\ntime per operation. This is tight for constant-sized alphabets: Clifford et al.\n(STACS 2018) achieved $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ time per operation in that case,\nbut with $\\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$ time per operation for large alphabets. We\nimprove and extend this result with an algorithm that, given $1\\le x\\le k$,\nachieves update time $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{n}{k} +\\sqrt{\\frac{nk}{x}})$ and query\ntime $\\tilde{O}(x)$. In particular, for $k\\ge \\sqrt{n}$, an appropriate choice\nof $x$ yields $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt[3]{nk})$ time per operation, which is\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ when no threshold $k$ is provided.",

The Spatial Logic\nof Closure Spaces, SLCS, extends Modal Logic with reachability connectives\nthat, in turn, can be used for expressing interesting spatial properties, such\nas \"being near to\" or \"being surrounded by\". SLCS constitutes the kernel of a\nsolid logical framework for reasoning about discrete space, such as graphs and\ndigital images, interpreted as quasi discrete closure spaces. In particular,\nthe spatial model checker VoxLogicA, that uses an extended version of SLCS, has\nbeen used successfully in the domain of medical imaging.

In medical imaging such\nrepresentations of space are increasingly relevant, due to recent developments\nof 3D scanning and visualisation techniques that exploit mesh processing.

Other unlearning approaches by refactoring model or training data\nstruggle to gain a balance between overhead and model usability.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach, dubbed as DeepObliviate, to implement\nmachine unlearning efficiently, without modifying the normal training mode. Our\napproach improves the original training process by storing intermediate models\non the hard disk. Given a data point to unlearn, we first quantify its temporal\nresidual memory left in stored models.

Last, we stitch an unlearned model by combining the\nretrained models and uninfluenced models. We extensively evaluate our approach\non five datasets and deep learning models.

We decouple our learning process\ninto the image generation step and the I2I translation step. In the first step\nwe propose two novel techniques: source-target initialization and\nself-initialization of the adaptor layer. The former finetunes the pretrained\ngenerative model (e.g., StyleGAN) on source and target data. The latter allows\nto initialize all non-pretrained network parameters without the need of any\ndata. These techniques provide a better initialization for the I2I translation\nstep. In addition, we introduce an auxiliary GAN that further facilitates the\ntraining of deep I2I systems even from small datasets. In extensive experiments\non three datasets, (Animal faces, Birds, and Foods), we show that we outperform\nexisting methods and that mFID improves on several datasets with over 25\npoints.",

    "abstract": "Document layout analysis is crucial for understanding document structures. On\nthis task, vision and semantics of documents, and relations between layout\ncomponents contribute to the understanding process. Though many works have been\nproposed to exploit the above information, they show unsatisfactory results.\nNLP-based methods model layout analysis as a sequence labeling task and show\ninsufficient capabilities in layout modeling. CV-based methods model layout\nanalysis as a detection or segmentation task, but bear limitations of\ninefficient modality fusion and lack of relation modeling between layout\ncomponents. To address the above limitations, we propose a unified framework\nVSR for document layout analysis, combining vision, semantics and relations.\nVSR supports both NLP-based and CV-based methods. Specifically, we first\nintroduce vision through document image and semantics through text embedding\nmaps. Then, modality-specific visual and semantic features are extracted using\na two-stream network, which are adaptively fused to make full use of\ncomplementary information. Finally, given component candidates, a relation\nmodule based on graph neural network is incorported to model relations between\ncomponents and output final results. On three popular benchmarks, VSR\noutperforms previous models by large margins. Code will be released soon.",

    "abstract": "Table structure recognition is a challenging task due to the various\nstructures and complicated cell spanning relations. Previous methods handled\nthe problem starting from elements in different granularities (rows/columns,\ntext regions), which somehow fell into the issues like lossy heuristic rules or\nneglect of empty cell division. Based on table structure characteristics, we\nfind that obtaining the aligned bounding boxes of text region can effectively\nmaintain the entire relevant range of different cells. However, the aligned\nbounding boxes are hard to be accurately predicted due to the visual\nambiguities. In this paper, we aim to obtain more reliable aligned bounding\nboxes by fully utilizing the visual information from both text regions in\nproposed local features and cell relations in global features. Specifically, we\npropose the framework of Local and Global Pyramid Mask Alignment, which adopts\nthe soft pyramid mask learning mechanism in both the local and global feature\nmaps. It allows the predicted boundaries of bounding boxes to break through the\nlimitation of original proposals. A pyramid mask re-scoring module is then\nintegrated to compromise the local and global information and refine the\npredicted boundaries. Finally, we propose a robust table structure recovery\npipeline to obtain the final structure, in which we also effectively solve the\nproblems of empty cells locating and division.

    "abstract": "What we expect from radiology AI algorithms will shape the selection and\nimplementation of AI in the radiologic practice. In this paper I consider\nprevailing expectations of AI and compare them to expectations that we have of\nhuman readers. I observe that the expectations from AI and radiologists are\nfundamentally different. The expectations of AI are based on a strong and\njustified mistrust about the way that AI makes decisions. Because AI decisions\nare not well understood, it is difficult to know how the algorithms will behave\nin new, unexpected situations. However, this mistrust is not mirrored in our\nexpectations of human readers. Despite well-proven idiosyncrasies and biases in\nhuman decision making, we take comfort from the assumption that others make\ndecisions in a way as we do, and we trust our own decision making. Despite poor\nability to explain decision making processes in humans, we accept explanations\nof decisions given by other humans. Because the goal of radiology is the most\naccurate radiologic interpretation, our expectations of radiologists and AI\nshould be similar, and both should reflect a healthy mistrust of complicated\nand partially opaque decision processes undergoing in computer algorithms and\nhuman brains. This is generally not the case now.",

    "title": "LANA: Towards Personalized Deep Knowledge Tracing Through  Distinguishable Interactive Sequences",
    "abstract": "In educational applications, Knowledge Tracing (KT), the problem of\naccurately predicting students' responses to future questions by summarizing\ntheir knowledge states, has been widely studied for decades as it is considered\na fundamental task towards adaptive online learning. Among all the proposed KT\nmethods, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and its variants are by far the most\neffective ones due to the high flexibility of the neural network. However, DKT\noften ignores the inherent differences between students (e.g. memory skills,\nreasoning skills, ...), averaging the performances of all students, leading to\nthe lack of personalization, and therefore was considered insufficient for\nadaptive learning. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we proposed\nLeveled Attentive KNowledge TrAcing (LANA), which firstly uses a novel\nstudent-related features extractor (SRFE) to distill students' unique inherent\nproperties from their respective interactive sequences. Secondly, the pivot\nmodule was utilized to dynamically reconstruct the decoder of the neural\nnetwork on attention of the extracted features, successfully distinguishing the\nperformance between students over time. Moreover, inspired by Item Response\nTheory (IRT), the interpretable Rasch model was used to cluster students by\ntheir ability levels, and thereby utilizing leveled learning to assign\ndifferent encoders to different groups of students. With pivot module\nreconstructed the decoder for individual students and leveled learning\nspecialized encoders for groups, personalized DKT was achieved. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on two real-world large-scale datasets demonstrated that\nour proposed LANA improves the AUC score by at least 1.00% (i.e. EdNet 1.46%\nand RAIEd2020 1.00%), substantially surpassing the other State-Of-The-Art KT\nmethods.",

Reinforcement Learning (RL), the dominant paradigm by which an\nagent might learn to solve arbitrary solvable problems, gives an agent a\ndangerous incentive: to gain arbitrary \"power\" in order to intervene in the\nprovision of their own reward. We review the arguments that generally\nintelligent algorithmic-information-theoretic reinforcement learners such as\nHutter's (2005) AIXI would seek arbitrary power, including over us. Then, using\nan information-theoretic exploration schedule, and a setup inspired by causal\ninfluence theory, we present a variant of AIXI which learns to not seek\narbitrary power; we call it \"unambitious\". We show that our agent learns to\naccrue reward at least as well as a human mentor, while relying on that mentor\nwith diminishing probability. And given a formal assumption that we probe\nempirically, we show that eventually, the agent's world-model incorporates the\nfollowing true fact: intervening in the \"outside world\" will have no effect on\nreward acquisition; hence, it has no incentive to shape the outside world.",

The diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment\n(MCI) is considered an effective means to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nDoctors diagnose MCI based on various clinical examinations, which are\nexpensive and the diagnosis results rely on the knowledge of doctors.\nTherefore, it is necessary to develop a robot diagnostic system to eliminate\nthe influence of human factors and obtain a higher accuracy rate. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Group Feature Domain Adversarial Neural Network\n(GF-DANN) for amnestic MCI (aMCI) diagnosis, which involves two important\nmodules.

A Dual Branch Domain Adaptation (DBDA) module is carefully designed\nto reduce the distribution difference between the source and target domain in a\ndomain adaption way. On three types of data set, GF-DANN achieves the best\naccuracy compared with classic machine learning and deep learning methods. On\nthe DMS data set, GF-DANN has obtained an accuracy rate of 89.47%, and the\nsensitivity and specificity are 90% and 89%.

Finding efficient strategies to select which carousels to display is an\nactive research topic of great industrial interest. In this setting, the\noverall quality of the recommendations of a new algorithm cannot be assessed by\nmeasuring solely its individual recommendation quality. Rather, it should be\nevaluated in a context where other recommendation lists are already available,\nto account for how they complement each other. This is not considered by\ntraditional offline evaluation protocols. Hence, we propose an offline\nevaluation protocol for a carousel setting in which the recommendation quality\nof a model is measured by how much it improves upon that of an already\navailable set of carousels. We report experiments on publicly available\ndatasets on the movie domain and notice that under a carousel setting the\nranking of the algorithms change. In particular, when a SLIM carousel is\navailable, matrix factorization models tend to be preferred, while item-based\nmodels are penalized. We also propose to extend ranking metrics to the\ntwo-dimensional carousel layout in order to account for a known position bias,\ni.e. users will not explore the lists sequentially, but rather concentrate on\nthe top-left corner of the screen.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has caused an enormous burden on healthcare facilities around the\nworld. Cohorting patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) into \"bubbles\"\nhas been proposed as an infection-control mechanism. In this paper, we present\na novel and flexible model for clustering patient care in healthcare facilities\ninto bubbles in order to minimize infection spread. Our model aims to control a\nvariety of costs to patients/residents and HCPs so as to avoid hidden,\ndownstream adverse effects of clustering patient care. This model leads to a\ndiscrete optimization problem that we call the BubbleClustering problem. This\nproblem takes as input a temporal visit graph, representing HCP mobility,\nincluding visits by HCPs to patient/resident rooms. The output of the problem\nis a rewired visit graph, obtained by partitioning HCPs and patient rooms into\nbubbles and rewiring HCP visits to patient rooms so that patient-care is\nlargely confined to the constructed bubbles. Even though the BubbleClustering\nproblem is intractable in general, we present an integer linear programming\n(ILP) formulation of the problem that can be solved optimally for problem\ninstances that arise from typical hospital units and long-term-care facilities.\nWe call our overall solution approach Cost-aware Rewiring of Networks (CoRN).\nWe evaluate CoRN using fine-grained-movement data from a\nhospital-medical-intensive-care unit as well as two long-term-care facilities.\nThese data were obtained using sensor systems we built and deployed. The main\ntakeaway from our experimental results is that it is possible to use CoRN to\nsubstantially reduce infection spread by cohorting patients and HCPs without\nsacrificing patient-care, and with minimal excess costs to HCPs in terms of\ntime and distances traveled during a shift.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN), one of the most powerful machine learning\nalgorithms, is increasingly leveraged to overcome the bottleneck of effectively\nexploring and analyzing massive data to boost advanced scientific development.\nIt is not a surprise that cloud computing providers offer the cloud-based DNN\nas an out-of-the-box service. Though there are some benefits from the\ncloud-based DNN, the interaction mechanism among two or multiple entities in\nthe cloud inevitably induces new privacy risks. This survey presents the most\nrecent findings of privacy attacks and defenses appeared in cloud-based neural\nnetwork services. We systematically and thoroughly review privacy attacks and\ndefenses in the pipeline of cloud-based DNN service, i.e., data manipulation,\ntraining, and prediction. In particular, a new theory, called cloud-based ML\nprivacy game, is extracted from the recently published literature to provide a\ndeep understanding of state-of-the-art research. Finally, the challenges and\nfuture work are presented to help researchers to continue to push forward the\ncompetitions between privacy attackers and defenders.",

    "abstract": "The goal of one-class collaborative filtering (OCCF) is to identify the\nuser-item pairs that are positively-related but have not been interacted yet,\nwhere only a small portion of positive user-item interactions (e.g., users'\nimplicit feedback) are observed. For discriminative modeling between positive\nand negative interactions, most previous work relied on negative sampling to\nsome extent, which refers to considering unobserved user-item pairs as\nnegative, as actual negative ones are unknown. However, the negative sampling\nscheme has critical limitations because it may choose \"positive but unobserved\"\npairs as negative. This paper proposes a novel OCCF framework, named as BUIR,\nwhich does not require negative sampling. To make the representations of\npositively-related users and items similar to each other while avoiding a\ncollapsed solution, BUIR adopts two distinct encoder networks that learn from\neach other; the first encoder is trained to predict the output of the second\nencoder as its target, while the second encoder provides the consistent targets\nby slowly approximating the first encoder. In addition, BUIR effectively\nalleviates the data sparsity issue of OCCF, by applying stochastic data\naugmentation to encoder inputs. Based on the neighborhood information of users\nand items, BUIR randomly generates the augmented views of each positive\ninteraction each time it encodes, then further trains the model by this\nself-supervision. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that BUIR consistently\nand significantly outperforms all baseline methods by a large margin especially\nfor much sparse datasets in which any assumptions about negative interactions\nare less valid.",

    "abstract": "Crack detection is of great significance for monitoring the integrity and\nwell-being of the infrastructure such as bridges and underground pipelines,\nwhich are harsh environments for people to access. In recent years, computer\nvision techniques have been applied in detecting cracks in concrete structures.\nHowever, they suffer from variances in light conditions and shadows, lacking\nrobustness and resulting in many false positives. To address the uncertainty in\nvision, human inspectors actively touch the surface of the structures, guided\nby vision, which has not been explored in autonomous crack detection. In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach to detect and reconstruct cracks in concrete\nstructures using vision-guided active tactile perception. Given an RGB-D image\nof a structure, the rough profile of the crack in the structure surface will\nfirst be segmented with a fine-tuned Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, and a\nset of contact points are generated to guide the collection of tactile images\nby a camera-based optical tactile sensor. When contacts are made, a pixel-wise\nmask of the crack can be obtained from the tactile images and therefore the\nprofile of the crack can be refined by aligning the RGB-D image and the tactile\nimages. Extensive experiment results have shown that the proposed method\nimproves the effectiveness and robustness of crack detection and reconstruction\nsignificantly, compared to crack detection with vision only, and has the\npotential to enable robots to help humans with the inspection and repair of the\nconcrete infrastructure.",

To learn equations rather than maps, standard\nnon-linearities can be replaced with structured building blocks of atomic\nfunctions. However, without strong priors on sparsity and structure,\nrepresentational complexity and numerical conditioning limit this direct\napproach. To scale to realistic settings in science and engineering, we propose\nan informed equation learning system.

    "abstract": "For tabletop rearrangement problems with overhand grasps, storage space\noutside the tabletop workspace, or buffers, can temporarily hold objects which\ngreatly facilitates the resolution of a given rearrangement task. This brings\nforth the natural question of how many running buffers are required so that\ncertain classes of tabletop rearrangement problems are feasible. In this work,\nwe examine the problem for both the labeled (where each object has a specific\ngoal pose) and the unlabeled (where goal poses of objects are interchangeable)\nsettings. On the structural side, we observe that finding the minimum number of\nrunning buffers (MRB) can be carried out on a dependency graph abstracted from\na problem instance, and show that computing MRB on dependency graphs is\nNP-hard. We then prove that under both labeled and unlabeled settings, even for\nuniform cylindrical objects, the number of required running buffers may grow\nunbounded as the number of objects to be rearranged increases; we further show\nthat the bound for the unlabeled case is tight. On the algorithmic side, we\ndevelop highly effective algorithms for finding MRB for both labeled and\nunlabeled tabletop rearrangement problems, scalable to over a hundred objects\nunder very high object density. Employing these algorithms, empirical\nevaluations show that random labeled and unlabeled instances, which more\nclosely mimics real-world setups, have much smaller MRBs.",

To achieve better generalization, we propose a novel\nneighborhood-aware NAS formulation to identify flat-minima architectures in the\nsearch space, with the assumption that flat minima generalize better than sharp\nminima. The phrase \"flat-minima architecture\" refers to architectures whose\nperformance is stable under small perturbations in the architecture (e.g.,\nreplacing a convolution with a skip connection). Our formulation takes the\n\"flatness\" of an architecture into account by aggregating the performance over\nthe neighborhood of this architecture. We demonstrate a principled way to apply\nour formulation to existing search algorithms, including sampling-based\nalgorithms and gradient-based algorithms. To facilitate the application to\ngradient-based algorithms, we also propose a differentiable representation for\nthe neighborhood of architectures. Based on our formulation, we propose\nneighborhood-aware random search (NA-RS) and neighborhood-aware differentiable\narchitecture search (NA-DARTS).

    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) has been utilized pervasively in the Internet of Things\n(IoT). One typical application of DL in IoT is device identification from\nwireless signals, namely Non-cryptographic Device Identification (NDI).\nHowever, learning components in NDI systems have to evolve to adapt to\noperational variations, such a paradigm is termed as Incremental Learning (IL).\nVarious IL algorithms have been proposed and many of them require dedicated\nspace to store the increasing amount of historical data, and therefore, they\nare not suitable for IoT or mobile applications. However, conventional IL\nschemes can not provide satisfying performance when historical data are not\navailable. In this paper, we address the IL problem in NDI from a new\nperspective, firstly, we provide a new metric to measure the degree of\ntopological maturity of DNN models from the degree of conflict of\nclass-specific fingerprints. We discover that an important cause for\nperformance degradation in IL enabled NDI is owing to the conflict of devices'\nfingerprints. Second, we also show that the conventional IL schemes can lead to\nlow topological maturity of DNN models in NDI systems. Thirdly, we propose a\nnew Channel Separation Enabled Incremental Learning (CSIL) scheme without using\nhistorical data, in which our strategy can automatically separate devices'\nfingerprints in different learning stages and avoid potential conflict.\nFinally, We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework using real\ndata from ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), an application of\nIoT in aviation. The proposed framework has the potential to be applied to\naccurate identification of IoT devices in a variety of IoT applications and\nservices.

What happened was not\nexactly a shift to an online learning model but a transition to a new approach\ncalled Emergency Remote Teaching. It is a temporary strategy to keep activities\ngoing on until it is safe again to return to the physical facilities of\nuniversities. This new setting became a challenge to both teachers and\nstudents. The lack of interaction and classroom socialization became obstacles\nfor students to continue engaged. Before the pandemic, hackathons --\nshort-lived events (1 to 3 days) where participants intensively collaboration\nto develop software prototypes -- were starting to be explored as an\nalternative venue to engage students in acquiring and practicing technical\nskills. In this paper, we present an experience report on the usage of an\nonline hackathon as a resource to engage students in the development of their\nsemester project in a distributed applications course during this emergency\nremote teaching period. We describe details of the intervention and present an\nanalysis of the students' perspective of the approach. One of the important\nfindings was the efficient usage of the Discord communication tool -- already\nused by all students while playing games -- which helped them socialize and\nkeep them continuously engaged in synchronous group work, \"virtually\ncollocated\".",

Frequent pattern mining is considered an essential task\nin the network science literature. In addition to the numerous applications,\nthe investigation of frequent pattern mining in networks directly impacts other\nanalytical approaches, such as clustering, quasi-clique and clique mining, and\nlink prediction. In nearly all the algorithms proposed for frequent pattern\nmining in temporal networks, the networks are represented as sequences of\nstatic networks. Then, the inter- or intra-network patterns are mined. This\ntype of representation imposes a computation-expressiveness trade-off to the\nmining problem. In this paper, we propose a novel representation that can\npreserve the temporal aspects of the network losslessly. Then, we introduce the\nconcept of constrained interval graphs (CIGs). Next, we develop a series of\nalgorithms for mining the complete set of frequent temporal patterns in a\ntemporal network data set.

Our method models imitation learning as a state estimation\nproblem, with the state defined as the end-effector's pose at the point where\nobject interaction begins, as observed from the demonstration. By modelling a\nmanipulation task as a coarse, approach trajectory followed by a fine,\ninteraction trajectory, this state estimator can be trained in a\nself-supervised manner, by automatically moving the end-effector's camera\naround the object. At test time, the end-effector is moved to the estimated\nstate through a linear path, at which point the demonstration's end-effector\nvelocities are simply repeated, enabling convenient acquisition of a complex\ninteraction trajectory without actually needing to explicitly learn a policy.\nReal-world experiments on 8 everyday tasks show that our method can learn a\ndiverse range of skills from just a single human demonstration, whilst also\nyielding a stable and interpretable controller.",

We show that the outcomes of the analysis can be very useful\nto support decision processes at many levels.

The results show that\nthe mean efficiency scores fall between 0.85 and 0.93 for all professors no\nmatters their category. In spite of enabling more fairness, such an approach\nsuffers from its exclusive character, which is contrary to the democratic\nspirit of DEA. The second case tries to cope with this deficiency through the\nassessment of the faculty members as a single sample drawn from the same\npopulation, i.e., Assistant professors, Associate professors, and Full\nprofessors are treated equally, only on the ground of their respective inputs\nand outputs, no matters their academic rank. A clear efficiency decline is\nreported, basically due to the very nature of DEA as a procedure that is more\nefficiency than output focused.",

Previous pruning methods often zero out\nunimportant channels in training in a deterministic manner, which reduces CNN's\nlearning capacity and results in suboptimal performance. To address this\nproblem, we develop a probability-based pruning algorithm, called batch\nwhitening channel pruning (BWCP), which can stochastically discard unimportant\nchannels by modeling the probability of a channel being activated. BWCP has\nseveral merits. (1) It simultaneously trains and prunes CNNs from scratch in a\nprobabilistic way, exploring larger network space than deterministic methods.\n(2) BWCP is empowered by the proposed batch whitening tool, which is able to\nempirically and theoretically increase the activation probability of useful\nchannels while keeping unimportant channels unchanged without adding any extra\nparameters and computational cost in inference. (3) Extensive experiments on\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet with various network architectures show that\nBWCP outperforms its counterparts by achieving better accuracy given limited\ncomputational budgets. For example, ResNet50 pruned by BWCP has only 0.70\\%\nTop-1 accuracy drop on ImageNet, while reducing 43.1\\% FLOPs of the plain\nResNet50.",

As scheduling non-determinism creates\nexponentially large spaces of thread interleavings, SMC attempts to partition\nthis space into equivalence classes and explore only a few representatives from\neach class. The efficiency of this approach depends on two factors: (a) the\ncoarseness of the partitioning, and (b) the time to generate representatives in\neach class. For this reason, the search for coarse partitionings that are\nefficiently explorable is an active research challenge.\nIn this work we present RVF-SMC, a new SMC algorithm that uses a novel\n\\emph{reads-value-from (RVF)} partitioning. Intuitively, two interleavings are\ndeemed equivalent if they agree on the value obtained in each read event, and\nread events induce consistent causal orderings between them. The RVF\npartitioning is provably coarser than recent approaches based on Mazurkiewicz\nand \"reads-from\" partitionings. Our experimental evaluation reveals that RVF is\nquite often a very effective equivalence, as the underlying partitioning is\nexponentially coarser than other approaches.

However,\nresults of current approaches still fall short of their promise of\nhigh-resolution synthesis. We hypothesize that this is mostly due to the highly\nengineered nature of these approaches which often rely on auxiliary losses and\nintermediate steps such as mask generators. In this note, we present an\northogonal approach to this task, where the generative model is based on pure\nlikelihood training without additional objectives. To do so, we first optimize\na powerful compression model with adversarial training which learns to\nreconstruct its inputs via a discrete latent bottleneck and thereby effectively\nstrips the latent representation of high-frequency details such as texture.\nSubsequently, we train an autoregressive transformer model to learn the\ndistribution of the discrete image representations conditioned on a tokenized\nversion of the layouts. Our experiments show that the resulting system is able\nto synthesize high-quality images consistent with the given layouts. In\nparticular, we improve the state-of-the-art FID score on COCO-Stuff and on\nVisual Genome by up to 19% and 53% and demonstrate the synthesis of images up\nto 512 x 512 px on COCO and Open Images.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new generative model for 3D garment deformations that enables us\nto learn, for the first time, a data-driven method for virtual try-on that\neffectively addresses garment-body collisions. In contrast to existing methods\nthat require an undesirable postprocessing step to fix garment-body\ninterpenetrations at test time, our approach directly outputs 3D garment\nconfigurations that do not collide with the underlying body. Key to our success\nis a new canonical space for garments that removes pose-and-shape deformations\nalready captured by a new diffused human body model, which extrapolates body\nsurface properties such as skinning weights and blendshapes to any 3D point. We\nleverage this representation to train a generative model with a novel\nself-supervised collision term that learns to reliably solve garment-body\ninterpenetrations. We extensively evaluate and compare our results with\nrecently proposed data-driven methods, and show that our method is the first to\nsuccessfully address garment-body contact in unseen body shapes and motions,\nwithout compromising realism and detail.",

    "title": "Contrastive Learning of Image Representations with Cross-Video  Cycle-Consistency",
    "abstract": "Recent works have advanced the performance of self-supervised representation\nlearning by a large margin. The core among these methods is intra-image\ninvariance learning. Two different transformations of one image instance are\nconsidered as a positive sample pair, where various tasks are designed to learn\ninvariant representations by comparing the pair. Analogically, for video data,\nrepresentations of frames from the same video are trained to be closer than\nframes from other videos, i.e. intra-video invariance. However, cross-video\nrelation has barely been explored for visual representation learning. Unlike\nintra-video invariance, ground-truth labels of cross-video relation is usually\nunavailable without human labors. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive\nlearning method which explores the cross-video relation by using\ncycle-consistency for general image representation learning. This allows to\ncollect positive sample pairs across different video instances, which we\nhypothesize will lead to higher-level semantics. We validate our method by\ntransferring our image representation to multiple downstream tasks including\nvisual object tracking, image classification, and action recognition. We show\nsignificant improvement over state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods.\nProject page is available at https://happywu.github.io/cycle_contrast_video.",

Next, we propose a hybrid network update strategy that targets specific\nnetwork components, which balances efficiency and accuracy.

International\nchallenges have become the standard for validation of biomedical image analysis\nmethods. However, the actual performance of participating (even the winning)\nalgorithms on \"real-world\" clinical data often remains unclear, as the data\nincluded in challenges are usually acquired in very controlled settings at few\ninstitutions. The seemingly obvious solution of just collecting increasingly\nmore data from more institutions in such challenges does not scale well due to\nprivacy and ownership hurdles. Towards alleviating these concerns, we are\nproposing the FeTS challenge 2021 to cater towards both the development and the\nevaluation of models for the segmentation of intrinsically heterogeneous (in\nappearance, shape, and histology) brain tumors, namely gliomas. Specifically,\nthe FeTS 2021 challenge uses clinically acquired, multi-institutional magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) scans from the BraTS 2020 challenge, as well as from\nvarious remote independent institutions included in the collaborative network\nof a real-world federation (https://www.fets.ai/). The goals of the FeTS\nchallenge are directly represented by the two included tasks: 1) the\nidentification of the optimal weight aggregation approach towards the training\nof a consensus model that has gained knowledge via federated learning from\nmultiple geographically distinct institutions, while their data are always\nretained within each institution, and 2) the federated evaluation of the\ngeneralizability of brain tumor segmentation models \"in the wild\", i.e. on data\nfrom institutional distributions that were not part of the training datasets.",

This is commonly\nachieved by obtaining multiple undersampled images, simultaneously, through\nparallel imaging. In this paper, we propose the Dual-Octave Network (DONet),\nwhich is capable of learning multi-scale spatial-frequency features from both\nthe real and imaginary components of MR data, for fast parallel MR image\nreconstruction. More specifically, our DONet consists of a series of\nDual-Octave convolutions (Dual-OctConv), which are connected in a dense manner\nfor better reuse of features. In each Dual-OctConv, the input feature maps and\nconvolutional kernels are first split into two components (ie, real and\nimaginary), and then divided into four groups according to their spatial\nfrequencies. Then, our Dual-OctConv conducts intra-group information updating\nand inter-group information exchange to aggregate the contextual information\nacross different groups. Our framework provides three appealing benefits: (i)\nIt encourages information interaction and fusion between the real and imaginary\ncomponents at various spatial frequencies to achieve richer representational\ncapacity. (ii) The dense connections between the real and imaginary groups in\neach Dual-OctConv make the propagation of features more efficient by feature\nreuse. (iii) DONet enlarges the receptive field by learning multiple\nspatial-frequency features of both the real and imaginary components.

In this context the use of mathematical models for epidemics is of\ngreat importance, since they are useful tools to study the underlying outbreak\nnumbers and allow one to test the effectiveness of different strategies used to\ncombat the associated diseases. This work deals with the development and\ncalibration of an epidemic model to describe the 2016 outbreak of Zika virus in\nBrazil. A system of 8 differential equations with 8 parameters is employed to\nmodel the evolution of the infection through two populations. Nominal values\nfor the model parameters are estimated from the literature. An inverse problem\nis formulated and solved by comparing the system response to real data from the\noutbreak. The calibrated results presents realistic parameters and returns\nreasonable descriptions, with the curve shape similar to the outbreak evolution\nand peak value close to the highest number of infected people during 2016.\nConsiderations about the lack of data for some initial conditions are also made\nthrough an analysis over the response behavior according to their change in\nvalue.",

    "abstract": "A basic requirement for a mathematical model is often that its solution\n(output) shouldn't change much if the model's parameters (input) are perturbed.\nThis is important because the exact values of parameters may not be known and\none would like to avoid being mislead by an output obtained using incorrect\nvalues. Thus, it's rarely enough to address an application by formulating a\nmodel, solving the resulting optimization problem and presenting the solution\nas the answer. One would need to confirm that the model is suitable, i.e.,\n\"good,\" and this can, at least in part, be achieved by considering a family of\noptimization problems constructed by perturbing parameters of concern. The\nresulting sensitivity analysis uncovers troubling situations with unstable\nsolutions, which we referred to as \"bad\" models, and indicates better model\nformulations. Embedding an actual problem of interest within a family of\nproblems is also a primary path to optimality conditions as well as\ncomputationally attractive, alternative problems, which under ideal\ncircumstances, and when properly tuned, may even furnish the minimum value of\nthe actual problem. The tuning of these alternative problems turns out to be\nintimately tied to finding multipliers in optimality conditions and thus\nemerges as a main component of several optimization algorithms. In fact, the\ntuning amounts to solving certain dual optimization problems. In this tutorial,\nwe'll discuss the opportunities and insights afforded by this broad\nperspective.",

Recent efforts have sought to leverage machine learning methods\nto tackle the challenge of astronomical transient classification, with ever\nimproving success. Transformers are a recently developed deep learning\narchitecture, first proposed for natural language processing, that have shown a\ngreat deal of recent success. In this work we develop a new transformer\narchitecture, which uses multi-head self attention at its core, for general\nmulti-variate time-series data.

We apply the\ntime-series transformer to the task of photometric classification, minimising\nthe reliance of expert domain knowledge for feature selection, while achieving\nresults comparable to state-of-the-art photometric classification methods.

Because\nof the need to explore a wide range of alternative scenarios and other sources\nof uncertainties in a computationally efficient manner, climate models can only\ntake us so far, as they require significant computational resources, especially\nwhen attempting to characterize extreme events, which are rare and thus demand\nlong and numerous simulations in order to accurately represent their changing\nstatistics.
