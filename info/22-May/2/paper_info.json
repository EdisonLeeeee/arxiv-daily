    "abstract": "Architects and systems designers artfully balance multiple competing design\nconstraints during the design process but are unable to translate between\nsystem metrics and end user experience. This work presents three methodologies\nto fill in this gap. The first is an incentive-compatible methodology that\ndetermines a \"ground truth\" measurement of users' value of speed in terms of US\ndollars, and find that users would accept a performance losses of 10%, 20%, and\n30% to their personal computer in exchange for \\$2.27, \\$4.07, and \\$4.43 per\nday, respectively. However, while highly accurate the methodology is a\npainstaking process and does not scale with large numbers of participants. To\nallow for scalability, we introduce a second methodology -- a lab-based\nsimulation experiment -- which finds that users would accept a permanent\nperformance loss of 10%, 20%, and 30% to their personal computer in exchange\nfor \\$127, \\$169, and \\$823, respectively. Finally, to allow for even greater\nscalability, we introduce a third methodology -- a survey -- and observe that\nthe lack of incentive compatibility and the lack of hands-on experience with\nthrottled device performance skews the results significantly, thus\ndemonstrating the need for lab-based or incentive compatible study designs. By\nquantifying the tradeoff between user satisfaction and performance, we enable\narchitects and systems designers to make more nuanced tradeoffs between design\nrequirements.",

The\ndata-driven insights would allow educational institutions and educators to\ndevelop and implement pedagogical interventions targeting academically at-risk\nstudents.

For hierarchical data, instead of\ntraditional Euclidean space, hyperbolic space as an embedding space has shown\nthe promise of high fidelity and low memory consumption; however, existing\nhyperbolic KGE methods neglect to model them. To address this issue, we propose\na novel KGE model -- hyperbolic hierarchical KGE (HypHKGE).

Moreover, we define the hyperbolic\nhierarchical transformations based on the theory of hyperbolic geometry, which\nutilize hierarchies that we preserved to infer the links.

    "abstract": "Multimodal sentiment analysis has been studied under the assumption that all\nmodalities are available. However, such a strong assumption does not always\nhold in practice, and most of multimodal fusion models may fail when partial\nmodalities are missing. Several works have addressed the missing modality\nproblem; but most of them only considered the single modality missing case, and\nignored the practically more general cases of multiple modalities missing. To\nthis end, in this paper, we propose a Tag-Assisted Transformer Encoder (TATE)\nnetwork to handle the problem of missing uncertain modalities. Specifically, we\ndesign a tag encoding module to cover both the single modality and multiple\nmodalities missing cases, so as to guide the network's attention to those\nmissing modalities. Besides, we adopt a new space projection pattern to align\ncommon vectors. Then, a Transformer encoder-decoder network is utilized to\nlearn the missing modality features. At last, the outputs of the Transformer\nencoder are used for the final sentiment classification.

    "abstract": "Inversion techniques are widely used to reconstruct subsurface physical\nproperties (e.g., velocity, conductivity, and others) from surface-based\ngeophysical measurements (e.g., seismic, electric/magnetic (EM) data). The\nproblems are governed by partial differential equations~(PDEs) like the wave or\nMaxwell's equations. Solving geophysical inversion problems is challenging due\nto the ill-posedness and high computational cost. To alleviate those issues,\nrecent studies leverage deep neural networks to learn the inversion mappings\nfrom geophysical measurements to the geophysical property directly.\nIn this paper, we show that such a mapping can be well modeled by a\n\\textit{very shallow}~(but not wide) network with only five layers. This is\nachieved based on our new finding of an intriguing property: \\textit{a\nnear-linear relationship between the input and output, after applying integral\ntransform in high dimensional space.} In particular, when dealing with the\ninversion from seismic data to subsurface velocity governed by a wave equation,\nthe integral results of velocity with Gaussian kernels are linearly correlated\nto the integral of seismic data with sine kernels. Furthermore, this property\ncan be easily turned into a light-weight encoder-decoder network for inversion.\nThe encoder contains the integration of seismic data and the linear\ntransformation without need for fine-tuning. The decoder only consists of a\nsingle transformer block to reverse the integral of velocity.\nExperiments show that this interesting property holds for two geophysics\ninversion problems over four different datasets.

Regarding the latter, a recent\nconcept of twin-width [Bonnet et al., FOCS 2020] appears to be very useful. For\ninstance, the question of these authors [CGTA 2019] about where is the exact\nlimit of fixed-parameter tractability of FO model checking on permutation\ngraphs has been answered by Bonnet et al. in 2020 quite easily, using the newly\nintroduced twin-width. We prove that such exact characterization of hereditary\nsubclasses with tractable FO model checking naturally extends from permutation\nto circle graphs (the intersection graphs of chords in a circle). Namely, we\nprove that under usual complexity assumptions, FO model checking of a\nhereditary class of circle graphs is in FPT if and only if the class excludes\nsome permutation graph. We also prove a similar excluded-subgraphs\ncharacterization for hereditary classes of interval graphs with FO model\nchecking in FPT, which concludes the line a research of interval classes with\ntractable FO model checking started in [Ganian et al., ICALP 2013].

In this\nway, the proposed GCN-FFNN model learns from two types of input\nrepresentations, i.e. grid and graph data, obtained via the discretization of\nthe PDE domain. The GCN-FFNN model is trained in two phases. In the first\nphase, the model parameters of each stream are trained separately. Both streams\nemploy the same error function to adjust their parameters by enforcing the\nmodels to satisfy the given PDE as well as its initial and boundary conditions\non grid or graph collocation (training) data. In the second phase, the learned\nparameters of two-stream layers are frozen and their learned representation\nsolutions are fed to fully connected layers whose parameters are learned using\nthe previously used error function. The learned GCN-FFNN model is tested on\ntest data located both inside and outside the PDE domain. The obtained\nnumerical results demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed\nGCN-FFNN model over individual GCN and FFNN models on 1D-Burgers,\n1D-Schr\\\"odinger, 2D-Burgers and 2D-Schr\\\"odinger equations.",

    "abstract": "Convincing people to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is a key societal\nchallenge in the present times. As a first step towards this goal, many prior\nworks have relied on social media analysis to understand the specific concerns\nthat people have towards these vaccines, such as potential side-effects,\nineffectiveness, political factors, and so on. Though there are datasets that\nbroadly classify social media posts into Anti-vax and Pro-Vax labels, there is\nno dataset (to our knowledge) that labels social media posts according to the\nspecific anti-vaccine concerns mentioned in the posts. In this paper, we have\ncurated CAVES, the first large-scale dataset containing about 10k COVID-19\nanti-vaccine tweets labelled into various specific anti-vaccine concerns in a\nmulti-label setting. This is also the first multi-label classification dataset\nthat provides explanations for each of the labels. Additionally, the dataset\nalso provides class-wise summaries of all the tweets. We also perform\npreliminary experiments on the dataset and show that this is a very challenging\ndataset for multi-label explainable classification and tweet summarization, as\nis evident by the moderate scores achieved by some state-of-the-art models.

As a remedy, we\npropose Learning to Split (ls), an algorithm for automatic bias detection.\nGiven a dataset with input-label pairs, ls learns to split this dataset so that\npredictors trained on the training split generalize poorly to the testing\nsplit. This performance gap provides a proxy for measuring the degree of bias\nin the learned features and can therefore be used to reduce biases. Identifying\nnon-generalizable splits is challenging as we don't have any explicit\nannotations about how to split. In this work, we show that the prediction\ncorrectness of the testing example can be used as a source of weak supervision:\ngeneralization performance will drop if we move examples that are predicted\ncorrectly away from the testing split, leaving only those that are\nmispredicted. We evaluate our approach on Beer Review, Waterbirds, CelebA and\nMNLI. Empirical results show that ls is able to generate astonishingly\nchallenging splits that correlate with human-identified biases. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that combining robust learning algorithms (such as group DRO) with\nsplits identified by ls enables automatic de-biasing.

It\nis well-known that BO does not scale well for high-dimensional problems because\nthe GPR model requires substantially more data points to achieve sufficient\naccuracy and acquisition optimization becomes computationally expensive in high\ndimensions. Several recent works aim at addressing these issues, e.g., methods\nthat implement online variable selection or conduct the search on a\nlower-dimensional sub-manifold of the original search space. Advancing our\nprevious work of PCA-BO that learns a linear sub-manifold, this paper proposes\na novel kernel PCA-assisted BO (KPCA-BO) algorithm, which embeds a non-linear\nsub-manifold in the search space and performs BO on this sub-manifold.\nIntuitively, constructing the GPR model on a lower-dimensional sub-manifold\nhelps improve the modeling accuracy without requiring much more data from the\nobjective function. Also, our approach defines the acquisition function on the\nlower-dimensional sub-manifold, making the acquisition optimization more\nmanageable.\nWe compare the performance of KPCA-BO to the vanilla BO and PCA-BO on the\nmulti-modal problems of the COCO/BBOB benchmark suite. Empirical results show\nthat KPCA-BO outperforms BO in terms of convergence speed on most test\nproblems, and this benefit becomes more significant when the dimensionality\nincreases.

    "abstract": "There are several measures for fairness in ranking, based on different\nunderlying assumptions and perspectives. PL optimization with the REINFORCE\nalgorithm can be used for optimizing black-box objective functions over\npermutations. In particular, it can be used for optimizing fairness measures.\nHowever, though effective for queries with a moderate number of repeating\nsessions, PL optimization has room for improvement for queries with a small\nnumber of repeating sessions.\nIn this paper, we present a novel way of representing permutation\ndistributions, based on the notion of permutation graphs. Similar to PL, our\ndistribution representation, called PPG, can be used for black-box optimization\nof fairness. Different from PL, where pointwise logits are used as the\ndistribution parameters, in PPG pairwise inversion probabilities together with\na reference permutation construct the distribution. As such, the reference\npermutation can be set to the best sampled permutation regarding the objective\nfunction, making PPG suitable for both deterministic and stochastic rankings.\nOur experiments show that PPG, while comparable to PL for larger session\nrepetitions (i.e., stochastic ranking), improves over PL for optimizing\nfairness metrics for queries with one session (i.e., deterministic ranking).\nAdditionally, when accurate utility estimations are available, e.g., in tabular\nmodels, the performance of PPG in fairness optimization is significantly\nboosted compared to lower quality utility estimations from a learning to rank\nmodel, leading to a large performance gap with PL. Finally, the pairwise\nprobabilities make it possible to impose pairwise constraints such as \"item\n$d_1$ should always be ranked higher than item $d_2$.\" Such constraints can be\nused to simultaneously optimize the fairness metric and control another\nobjective such as ranking performance.",

First, canonical self attention has a quadratic complexity\nw.r.t. the input time series length, thus falling short in efficiency. Second,\ndifferent variables' time series often have distinct temporal dynamics, which\nexisting studies fail to capture, as they use the same model parameter space,\ne.g., projection matrices, for all variables' time series, thus falling short\nin accuracy. To ensure high efficiency and accuracy, we propose Triformer, a\ntriangular, variable-specific attention. (i) Linear complexity: we introduce a\nnovel patch attention with linear complexity.

When a group of competing advertisers is managed by\na common agency, many forms of collusion, such as bid rigging, can be\nimplemented by coordinating bidding strategies, dramatically increasing\nadvertisers' value. We study the problem of finding bids and monetary transfers\nmaximizing the utility of a group of colluders, under GSP and VCG mechanisms.\nFirst, we introduce an abstract bid optimization problem -- called weighted\nutility problem (WUP) -- , which is useful in proving our results. We show that\nthe utilities of bidding strategies are related to the length of paths in a\ndirected acyclic weighted graph, whose structure and weights depend on the\nmechanism under study. This allows us to solve WUP in polynomial time by\nfinding a shortest path of the graph. Next, we switch to our original problem,\nfocusing on two settings that differ for the incentives they allow for.\nIncentive constraints ensure that colluders do not leave the agency, and they\ncan be enforced by implementing monetary transfers between the agency and the\nadvertisers. In particular, we study the arbitrary transfers setting, where any\nkind of monetary transfer to and from the advertisers is allowed, and the more\nrealistic limited liability setting, in which no advertiser can be paid by the\nagency. In the former, we cast the problem as a WUP instance and solve it by\nour graph-based algorithm, while, in the latter, we formulate it as a linear\nprogram with exponentially-many variables efficiently solvable by applying the\nellipsoid algorithm to its dual.

Recent reconstruction attacks apply a gradient inversion\noptimization on the gradient update of a single minibatch to reconstruct the\nprivate data used by clients during training. As the state-of-the-art\nreconstruction attacks solely focus on single update, realistic adversarial\nscenarios are overlooked, such as observation across multiple updates and\nupdates trained from multiple mini-batches. A few studies consider a more\nchallenging adversarial scenario where only model updates based on multiple\nmini-batches are observable, and resort to computationally expensive simulation\nto untangle the underlying samples for each local step. In this paper, we\npropose AGIC, a novel Approximate Gradient Inversion Attack that efficiently\nand effectively reconstructs images from both model or gradient updates, and\nacross multiple epochs. In a nutshell, AGIC (i) approximates gradient updates\nof used training samples from model updates to avoid costly simulation\nprocedures, (ii) leverages gradient/model updates collected from multiple\nepochs, and (iii) assigns increasing weights to layers with respect to the\nneural network structure for reconstruction quality.

Our main conclusion from this study is that the MDD, endowed with\nthe capability of full-duplex but less demand on SI cancellation than in-band\nfull-duplex (IBFD), outperforms both the conventional TDD and IBFD in combating\nchannel aging.",

We describe a\ncompute-in-memory (CIM) technique called FPIRM using Racetrack Memory (RM) to\naccelerate CNNs for edge systems. Using transverse read, a technique that can\ndetermine the number of '1's multiple adjacent domains, FPIRM can efficiently\nimplement multi-operand bulk-bitwise and addition computations, and two-operand\nmultiplication. We discuss how FPIRM can implement both variable precision\ninteger and floating point arithmetic. This allows both CNN inference and\non-device training without expensive data movement to the cloud. Based on these\nfunctions we demonstrate implementation of several CNNs with back propagation\nusing RM CIM and compare these to state-of-the-art implementations of CIM\ninference and training in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays.

    "abstract": "While universalism is a foundational principle of science, a growing stream\nof research finds that scientific contributions are evaluated differently\ndepending on the gender of the author, with women tending to receive fewer\ncitations relative to men, even for work of comparable quality. Strikingly,\nresearch also suggests that these gender gaps are visible even under blinded\nreview, wherein the evaluator is not aware of the gender of the author. In this\narticle, we consider whether gender differences in writing styles -- how men\nand women communicate their work -- may contribute to these observed gender\ngaps. We ground our investigation in a previously established framework for\ncharacterizing the linguistic style of written text, which distinguishes\nbetween two sets of features -- informational (i.e., features that emphasize\nfacts) and involved (i.e., features that emphasize relationships). Using a\nlarge, matched sample of academic papers and patents, we find significant\ndifferences in writing style by gender; women use more involved features in\ntheir writing, a pattern that holds universally across fields. The magnitude of\nthe effect varies across fields, with larger gender differences observed in the\nsocial sciences and arts humanities and smaller gaps in the physical sciences\nand technology. Subsequently, we show that gender differences in writing style\nmay have parallels in reading preferences; papers and patents with more\ninformational features tend to be cited more by men, while those with more\ninvolved features tend to be cited more by women, even after controlling for\nthe gender of the author, inventor, and patent attorney. Our findings suggest\nthat formal written text is not devoid of personal character, which could\ncontribute to bias in evaluation, thereby compromising the norm of\nuniversalism.",

Although adaptive model refinement can be\nemployed for enhanced effectiveness, it is cumbersome for the traditional\nmesh-based methods to perform while modeling the evolving localizations. In\nthis work, neural network-enhanced reproducing kernel particle method (NN-RKPM)\nis proposed, where the location, orientation, and shape of the solution\ntransition near a localization is automatically captured by the NN\napproximation via a block-level neural network optimization. The weights and\nbiases in the blocked parametrization network control the location and\norientation of the localization. The designed basic four-kernel NN block is\ncapable of capturing a triple junction or a quadruple junction topological\npattern, while more complicated localization topological patters are captured\nby the superposition of multiple four-kernel NN blocks. The standard RK\napproximation is then utilized to approximate the smooth part of the solution,\nwhich permits a much coarser discretization than the high-resolution\ndiscretization needed to capture sharp solution transitions with the\nconventional methods. A regularization of the neural network approximation is\nadditionally introduced for discretization-independent material responses.

    "title": "Designing for Responsible Trust in AI Systems: A Communication  Perspective",
    "abstract": "Current literature and public discourse on \"trust in AI\" are often focused on\nthe principles underlying trustworthy AI, with insufficient attention paid to\nhow people develop trust. Given that AI systems differ in their level of\ntrustworthiness, two open questions come to the fore: how should AI\ntrustworthiness be responsibly communicated to ensure appropriate and equitable\ntrust judgments by different users, and how can we protect users from deceptive\nattempts to earn their trust? We draw from communication theories and\nliterature on trust in technologies to develop a conceptual model called MATCH,\nwhich describes how trustworthiness is communicated in AI systems through\ntrustworthiness cues and how those cues are processed by people to make trust\njudgments. Besides AI-generated content, we highlight transparency and\ninteraction as AI systems' affordances that present a wide range of\ntrustworthiness cues to users. By bringing to light the variety of users'\ncognitive processes to make trust judgments and their potential limitations, we\nurge technology creators to make conscious decisions in choosing reliable\ntrustworthiness cues for target users and, as an industry, to regulate this\nspace and prevent malicious use. Towards these goals, we define the concepts of\nwarranted trustworthiness cues and expensive trustworthiness cues, and propose\na checklist of requirements to help technology creators identify appropriate\ncues to use. We present a hypothetical use case to illustrate how practitioners\ncan use MATCH to design AI systems responsibly, and discuss future directions\nfor research and industry efforts aimed at promoting responsible trust in AI.",

Understanding how each component of an evolutionary\nalgorithm influences its problem-solving success improves our ability to target\nparticular problem domains. Our work focuses on evaluating selection schemes,\nwhich choose individuals to contribute genetic material to the next generation.\nWe introduce four diagnostic search spaces for testing the strengths and\nweaknesses of selection schemes: the exploitation rate diagnostic, ordered\nexploitation rate diagnostic, contradictory objectives diagnostic, and the\nmulti-path exploration diagnostic. Each diagnostic is handcrafted to isolate\nand measure the relative exploitation and exploration characteristics of\nselection schemes. In this study, we use our diagnostics to evaluate six\npopulation selection methods: truncation selection, tournament selection,\nfitness sharing, lexicase selection, nondominated sorting, and novelty search.\nExpectedly, tournament and truncation selection excelled in gradient\nexploitation but poorly explored search spaces, and novelty search excelled at\nexploration but failed to exploit fitness gradients. Fitness sharing performed\npoorly across all diagnostics, suggesting poor overall exploitation and\nexploration abilities. Nondominated sorting was best for maintaining\npopulations comprised of individuals with different trade-offs of multiple\nobjectives, but struggled to effectively exploit fitness gradients. Lexicase\nselection balanced search space exploration with exploitation, generally\nperforming well across diagnostics. Our work demonstrates the value of\ndiagnostic search spaces for building a deeper understanding of selection\nschemes, which can then be used to improve or develop new selection methods.",

This growing area of research has exposed the limitation of\naccessibility of EHR datasets for all, as well as the reproducibility of\ndifferent modeling frameworks. One reason for these limitations is the lack of\nstandardized pre-processing pipelines. MIMIC is a freely available EHR dataset\nin a raw format that has been used in numerous studies. The absence of\nstandardized pre-processing steps serves as a major barrier to the wider\nadoption of the dataset.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems usually face the issue of filter bubbles:\noverrecommending homogeneous items based on user features and historical\ninteractions. Filter bubbles will grow along the feedback loop and\ninadvertently narrow user interests. Existing work usually mitigates filter\nbubbles by incorporating objectives apart from accuracy such as diversity and\nfairness. However, they typically sacrifice accuracy, hurting model fidelity\nand user experience. Worse still, users have to passively accept the\nrecommendation strategy and influence the system in an inefficient manner with\nhigh latency, e.g., keeping providing feedback (e.g., like and dislike) until\nthe system recognizes the user intention.\nThis work proposes a new recommender prototype called UserControllable\nRecommender System (UCRS), which enables users to actively control the\nmitigation of filter bubbles. Functionally, 1) UCRS can alert users if they are\ndeeply stuck in filter bubbles. 2) UCRS supports four kinds of control commands\nfor users to mitigate the bubbles at different granularities. 3) UCRS can\nrespond to the controls and adjust the recommendations on the fly. The key to\nadjusting lies in blocking the effect of out-of-date user representations on\nrecommendations, which contains historical information inconsistent with the\ncontrol commands. As such, we develop a causality-enhanced User-Controllable\nInference (UCI) framework, which can quickly revise the recommendations based\non user controls in the inference stage and utilize counterfactual inference to\nmitigate the effect of out-of-date user representations. Experiments on three\ndatasets validate that the UCI framework can effectively recommend more desired\nitems based on user controls, showing promising performance w.r.t. both\naccuracy and diversity.",

In this\npaper, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning method named RoSA that\nfocuses on utilizing non-aligned augmented views for node-level representation\nlearning.

Then we\nintroduce adversarial training as an auxiliary method to increase sampling\ndiversity and enhance the robustness of our model.

    "abstract": "Medical event prediction (MEP) is a fundamental task in the medical domain,\nwhich needs to predict medical events, including medications, diagnosis codes,\nlaboratory tests, procedures, outcomes, and so on, according to historical\nmedical records. The task is challenging as medical data is a type of complex\ntime series data with heterogeneous and temporal irregular characteristics.\nMany machine learning methods that consider the two characteristics have been\nproposed for medical event prediction. However, most of them consider the two\ncharacteristics separately and ignore the correlations among different types of\nmedical events, especially relations between historical medical events and\ntarget medical events. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network based\non attention mechanism, called cross-event attention-based time-aware network\n(CATNet), for medical event prediction. It is a time-aware, event-aware and\ntask-adaptive method with the following advantages: 1) modeling heterogeneous\ninformation and temporal information in a unified way and considering temporal\nirregular characteristics locally and globally respectively, 2) taking full\nadvantage of correlations among different types of events via cross-event\nattention. Experiments on two public datasets (MIMIC-III and eICU) show CATNet\ncan be adaptive with different MEP tasks and outperforms other state-of-the-art\nmethods on various MEP tasks.

    "title": "A Digital Twin Framework for Cyber Security in Cyber-Physical Systems",
    "abstract": "Currently, most of the research in digital twins focuses on simulation and\noptimization. Digital twins are especially useful for critical systems.\nHowever, digital twins can also be used for safety and cyber security. The idea\nof this paper is motivated by the limitations of cyber security in\nCyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). We introduce an efficient synchronization\napproach to maintain the state between the virtual environment and the physical\nenvironment. In this case, we can receive prompt feedback by conducting\nsecurity analysis in the virtual domain. Thus, helping to enhance the cyber\nsecurity of CPSs, we propose a digital twin-based framework. Based on the\napproach, the security of the CPSs can be protected by the digital twin system.\nMoreover, the proposed architecture has also been optimized to meet the\nsecurity requirements and maintain less network burden for CPSs",

    "abstract": "Predicting the geographic location (geo-localization) from a single\nground-level RGB image taken anywhere in the world is a very challenging\nproblem. The challenges include huge diversity of images due to different\nenvironmental scenarios, drastic variation in the appearance of the same\nlocation depending on the time of the day, weather, season, and more\nimportantly, the prediction is made from a single image possibly having only a\nfew geo-locating cues. For these reasons, most existing works are restricted to\nspecific cities, imagery, or worldwide landmarks. In this work, we focus on\ndeveloping an efficient solution to planet-scale single-image geo-localization.\nTo this end, we propose TransLocator, a unified dual-branch transformer network\nthat attends to tiny details over the entire image and produces robust feature\nrepresentation under extreme appearance variations. TransLocator takes an RGB\nimage and its semantic segmentation map as inputs, interacts between its two\nparallel branches after each transformer layer, and simultaneously performs\ngeo-localization and scene recognition in a multi-task fashion. We evaluate\nTransLocator on four benchmark datasets - Im2GPS, Im2GPS3k, YFCC4k, YFCC26k and\nobtain 5.5%, 14.1%, 4.9%, 9.9% continent-level accuracy improvement over the\nstate-of-the-art. TransLocator is also validated on real-world test images and\nfound to be more effective than previous methods.",

One inherent challenge of this task is\nthe emerging nature of e-commerce products -- we see new types of products with\ntheir unique set of new attributes constantly. Most prior works on this matter\nmine new values for a set of known attributes but cannot handle new attributes\nthat arose from constantly changing data. In this work, we study the attribute\nmining problem in an open-world setting to extract novel attributes and their\nvalues. Instead of providing comprehensive training data, the user only needs\nto provide a few examples for a few known attribute types as weak supervision.\nWe propose a principled framework that first generates attribute value\ncandidates and then groups them into clusters of attributes. The candidate\ngeneration step probes a pre-trained language model to extract phrases from\nproduct titles. Then, an attribute-aware fine-tuning method optimizes a\nmultitask objective and shapes the language model representation to be\nattribute-discriminative.

Existing methodologies that use sparse depth\nfrom visual SLAM mainly employ point features. However, point features have\nlimitations in preserving structural regularities owing to texture-less\nenvironments and sparsity problems. To deal with these issues, we perform depth\ncompletion with visual SLAM using line features, which can better contain\nstructural regularities than point features. The proposed methodology creates a\nconvex hull region by performing constrained Delaunay triangulation with depth\ninterpolation using line features. However, the generated depth includes\nlow-frequency information and is discontinuous at the convex hull boundary.\nTherefore, we propose a mesh depth refinement (MDR) module to address this\nproblem. The MDR module effectively transfers the high-frequency details of an\ninput image to the interpolated depth and plays a vital role in bridging the\nconventional and deep learning-based approaches. The Struct-MDC outperforms\nother state-of-the-art algorithms on public and our custom datasets, and even\noutperforms supervised methodologies for some metrics.

    "abstract": "Since context modeling is critical for estimating depth from a single image,\nresearchers put tremendous effort into obtaining global context. Many global\nmanipulations are designed for traditional CNN-based architectures to overcome\nthe locality of convolutions. Attention mechanisms or transformers originally\ndesigned for capturing long-range dependencies might be a better choice, but\nusually complicates architectures and could lead to a decrease in inference\nspeed. In this work, we propose a pure transformer architecture called SideRT\nthat can attain excellent predictions in real-time. In order to capture better\nglobal context, Cross-Scale Attention (CSA) and Multi-Scale Refinement (MSR)\nmodules are designed to work collaboratively to fuse features of different\nscales efficiently. CSA modules focus on fusing features of high semantic\nsimilarities, while MSR modules aim to fuse features at corresponding\npositions. These two modules contain a few learnable parameters without\nconvolutions, based on which a lightweight yet effective model is built. This\narchitecture achieves state-of-the-art performances in real-time (51.3 FPS) and\nbecomes much faster with a reasonable performance drop on a smaller backbone\nSwin-T (83.1 FPS). Furthermore, its performance surpasses the previous\nstate-of-the-art by a large margin, improving AbsRel metric 6.9% on KITTI and\n9.7% on NYU.

Hence, supplementing PFR with FFR requires a sophisticated control\nsystem and a high fidelity diesel electric generator model to design these\ncontrol systems.

    "abstract": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses have faced unprecedented challenges\nwhen trying to remain open. Because COVID-19 spreads through aerosolized\ndroplets, businesses were forced to distance their services; in some cases,\ndistancing may have involved moving business services online. In this work, we\nexplore digitization strategies used by small businesses that remained open\nduring the pandemic, and survey/interview small businesses owners to understand\npreliminary challenges associated with moving online. Furthermore, we analyze\npayments from 400K businesses across Japan, Australia, United States, Great\nBritain, and Canada. Following initial government interventions, we observe (at\nminimum for each country) a 47% increase in digitizing businesses compared to\npre-pandemic levels, with about 80% of surveyed businesses digitizing in under\na week. From both our quantitative models and our surveys/interviews, we find\nthat businesses rapidly digitized at the start of the pandemic in preparation\nof future uncertainty. We also conduct a case-study of initial digitization in\nthe United States, examining finer relationships between specific government\ninterventions, business sectors, political orientation, and resulting\ndigitization shifts. Finally, we discuss the implications of rapid & widespread\ndigitization for small businesses in the context of usability challenges and\ninterpersonal interactions, while highlighting potential shifts in pre-existing\nsocial norms.",

On\nthe other hand, people are stressed, becoming more anxious during COVID-19\npandemic situation and exhibits symptoms of behavioral disorder. To measure the\nsymptoms of behavioral disorder, usually psychiatrist use long hour sessions\nand inputs from specific questionnaire. This process is time consuming and\nsometime is ineffective to detect the right behavioral disorder. Also, reserved\npeople sometime hesitate to follow this process. We have created a digital\nframework which can detect behavioral disorder and prescribe virtual Cognitive\nBehavioral Therapy (vCBT) for recovery. By using this framework people can\ninput required data that are highly responsible for the three behavioral\ndisorders namely depression, anxiety and internet addiction.

    "abstract": "The past few years have witnessed the great success of Diffusion models~(DMs)\nin generating high-fidelity samples in generative modeling tasks. A major\nlimitation of the DM is its notoriously slow sampling procedure which normally\nrequires hundreds to thousands of time discretization steps of the learned\ndiffusion process to reach the desired accuracy. Our goal is to develop a fast\nsampling method for DMs with much less number of steps while retaining high\nsample quality. To this end, we systematically analyze the sampling procedure\nin DMs and identify key factors that affect the sample quality, among which the\nmethod of discretization is most crucial. By carefully examining the learned\ndiffusion process, we propose Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler~(DEIS).\nIt is based on the Exponential Integrator designed for discretizing ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) and leverages a semilinear structure of the\nlearned diffusion process to reduce the discretization error. The proposed\nmethod can be applied to any DMs and can generate high-fidelity samples in as\nfew as 10 steps. In our experiments, it takes about 3 minutes on one A6000 GPU\nto generate $50k$ images from CIFAR10.\nMoreover, by directly using pre-trained DMs, we achieve the state-of-art\nsampling performance when the number of score function evaluation~(NFE) is\nlimited, e.g., 3.37 FID and 9.74 Inception score with only 15 NFEs on CIFAR10.",

To alleviate it, unsupervised RL, a framework that\npre-trains the agent in a task-agnostic manner without access to the\ntask-specific reward, leverages active exploration for distilling diverse\nexperience into essential skills or reusable knowledge. For exploiting such\nbenefits also in robotic manipulation, we propose an unsupervised method for\ntransferable manipulation skill discovery that ties structured exploration\ntoward interacting behavior and transferable skill learning. It not only\nenables the agent to learn interaction behavior, the key aspect of the robotic\nmanipulation learning, without access to the environment reward, but also to\ngeneralize to arbitrary downstream manipulation tasks with the learned\ntask-agnostic skills.

In many cases, this approach improves the forecast error and\nreduces the required training data.

Therefore, we extended this idea to temporal convolutional networks to\nconsider those seasonalities.

    "abstract": "Chlorine is a widely used disinfectant and proxy for water quality (WQ)\nmonitoring in water distribution networks (WDN). Chlorine-based WQ regulation\nand control aims to maintain pathogen-free water. Chlorine residual evolution\nwithin WDN is commonly modeled using the typical single-species decay and\nreaction dynamics that account for network-wide, spatiotemporal chlorine\nconcentrations only. Prior studies have proposed more advanced and accurate\ndescriptions via multi-species dynamics. This paper presents a host of novel\nstate-space, control-theoretic representations of multi-species water quality\ndynamics. These representations describe decay, reaction, and transport of\nchlorine and a fictitious reactive substance to reflect realistic complex\nscenarios in WDN. Such dynamics are simulated over space- and time-discretized\ngrids of the transport partial differential equation and the nonlinear reaction\nordinary differential equation. To that end, this paper (i) provides a full\ndescription on how to formulate a high fidelity model-driven state-space\nrepresentation of the multi-species water quality dynamics and (ii)\ninvestigates the applicability and performance of different Eulerian-based\nschemes (Lax-Wendroff, backward Euler, and Crank- Nicolson) and\nLagrangian-based schemes (method of characteristics) in contrast with EPANET\nand its EPANET-MSX extension.

To overcome this problem, we follow a two-step approach: we first\ngenerate matching candidates using a pre-trained sentence transformer (so\ncalled bi-encoder). In a second step, we use fine-tuned transformer\ncross-encoders to generate the best candidates. We evaluate our approach on\nmultiple datasets and show that it is feasible and produces competitive\nresults.",

However, high fluctuations and increasing electrification cause huge\nforecast variability, not reflected in traditional point estimates.\nProbabilistic load forecasts take future uncertainties into account and thus\nallow more informed decision-making for the planning and operation of\nlow-carbon energy systems. We propose an approach for flexible conditional\ndensity forecasting of short-term load based on Bernstein polynomial\nnormalizing flows, where a neural network controls the parameters of the flow.\nIn an empirical study with 363 smart meter customers, our density predictions\ncompare favorably against Gaussian and Gaussian mixture densities.

Different\nfrom early researches that needed to rely on extra human resources and\nexpertise to help construct the system, recent researches focused on how to\nbuild DSMD in a purely data-driven manner. However, the previous data-driven\nDSMD methods largely overlooked the system interpretability, which is critical\nfor a medical application, and they also suffered from the data sparsity issue\nat the same time.

Moreover, we collect a new DSMD dataset,\nwhich has a much larger scale, more diverse patterns and is of higher quality\nthan the existing ones. The experiments show that our method obtains 7.7%,\n10.0%, 3.0% absolute improvement in diagnosis accuracy respectively on three\ndatasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of its rational decision process and\nmodel design.

In contrast to the existing active and wearable systems such as\nexoskeletons, we aim to create a lightweight and intuitive interface, capable\nof guiding its wearers towards more ergonomic and healthy working conditions.\nTo achieve this, a vibrotactile device called ErgoTac is employed to develop\nthree different feedback modalities that are able to provide a directional\nguidance at the body segments towards a desired pose. In addition, an\nevaluation is made to find the most suitable, comfortable, and intuitive\nfeedback modality for the user. Therefore, these modalities are first compared\nexperimentally on fifteen subjects wearing eight ErgoTac devices to achieve\ntargeted arm and torso configurations. The most effective directional feedback\nmodality is then evaluated on five subjects in a set of experiments in which an\nergonomic optimisation module provides the optimised body posture while\nperforming heavy lifting or forceful exertion tasks. The results yield strong\nevidence on the usefulness and the intuitiveness of one of the developed\nmodalities in providing guidance towards ergonomic working conditions, by\nminimising the effect of an external load on body joints.

However, the same embedding dimension for both dense entities and sparse\nentities will cause either over parameterization (sparse entities) or under\nfitting (dense entities). Normally, a large dimension is set to get better\nperformance. Meanwhile, the inference time grows log-linearly with the number\nof entities for all entities are traversed and compared. Both the parameter and\ninference become challenges when working with huge amounts of entities. Thus,\nwe propose PIE, a \\textbf{p}arameter and \\textbf{i}nference \\textbf{e}fficient\nsolution.

    "abstract": "Image harmonization aims to achieve visual consistency in composite images by\nadapting a foreground to make it compatible with a background. However,\nexisting methods always only use the real image as the positive sample to guide\nthe training, and at most introduce the corresponding composite image as a\nsingle negative sample for an auxiliary constraint, which leads to limited\ndistortion knowledge, and further causes a too large solution space, making the\ngenerated harmonized image distorted. Besides, none of them jointly constrain\nfrom the foreground self-style and foreground-background style consistency,\nwhich exacerbates this problem. Moreover, recent region-aware adaptive instance\nnormalization achieves great success but only considers the global background\nfeature distribution, making the aligned foreground feature distribution\nbiased. To address these issues, we propose a self-consistent style contrastive\nlearning scheme (SCS-Co). By dynamically generating multiple negative samples,\nour SCS-Co can learn more distortion knowledge and well regularize the\ngenerated harmonized image in the style representation space from two aspects\nof the foreground self-style and foreground-background style consistency,\nleading to a more photorealistic visual result.

Previous works have made efforts to\nlearn image-adaptive output color values of LUTs for flexible enhancement but\nneglect the importance of sampling strategy. They adopt a sub-optimal uniform\nsampling point allocation, limiting the expressiveness of the learned LUTs\nsince the (tri-)linear interpolation between uniform sampling points in the LUT\ntransform might fail to model local non-linearities of the color transform.\nFocusing on this problem, we present AdaInt (Adaptive Intervals Learning), a\nnovel mechanism to achieve a more flexible sampling point allocation by\nadaptively learning the non-uniform sampling intervals in the 3D color space.\nIn this way, a 3D LUT can increase its capability by conducting dense sampling\nin color ranges requiring highly non-linear transforms and sparse sampling for\nnear-linear transforms. The proposed AdaInt could be implemented as a compact\nand efficient plug-and-play module for a 3D LUT-based method. To enable the\nend-to-end learning of AdaInt, we design a novel differentiable operator called\nAiLUT-Transform (Adaptive Interval LUT Transform) to locate input colors in the\nnon-uniform 3D LUT and provide gradients to the sampling intervals.

    "abstract": "Text-based generative art has seen an explosion of interest in 2021. Online\ncommunities around text-based generative art as a novel digital medium have\nquickly emerged. This short paper identifies five types of prompt modifiers\nused by practitioners in the community of text-based generative art based on a\n3-month ethnographic study on Twitter. The novel taxonomy of prompt modifiers\nprovides researchers a conceptual starting point for investigating the\npractices of text-based generative art, but also may help practitioners of\ntext-based generative art improve their images. The paper concludes with a\ndiscussion of research opportunities in the space of text-based generative art\nand the broader implications of prompt engineering from the perspective of\nhuman-AI interaction in future applications beyond the use case of text-based\ngenerative art.",

    "abstract": "Student diversity, like academic background, learning styles, career and life\ngoals, ethnicity, age, social and emotional characteristics, course load and\nwork schedule, offers unique opportunities in education, like learning new\nskills, peer mentoring and example setting. But student diversity can be\nchallenging too as it adds variability in the way in which students learn and\nprogress over time. A single teaching approach is likely to be ineffective and\nresult in students not meeting their potential. Automated support could address\nlimitations of traditional teaching by continuously assessing student learning\nand implementing needed interventions. This paper discusses a novel methodology\nbased on data analytics and Machine Learning to measure and causally diagnose\nthe progress and shortcomings of student learning, and then utilizes the\ninsight gained on individuals to optimize learning. Diagnosis pertains to\ndynamic diagnostic formative assessment, which aims to uncover the causes of\nlearning shortcomings. The methodology groups learning difficulties into four\ncategories: recall from memory, concept adjustment, concept modification, and\nproblem decomposition into sub-goals (sub-problems) and concept combination.\nData models are predicting the occurrence of each of the four challenge types,\nas well as a student's learning trajectory. The models can be used to\nautomatically create real-time, student-specific interventions (e.g., learning\ncues) to address less understood concepts. We envision that the system will\nenable new adaptive pedagogical approaches to unleash student learning\npotential through customization of the course material to the background,\nabilities, situation, and progress of each student; and leveraging\ndiversity-related learning experiences.",

    "title": "A Validation Procedure for the Estimation of Reachable Regions in  Football",
    "abstract": "Modelling the trajectorial motion of humans along the ground is a\nfoundational task in the quantitative analysis of sports like association\nfootball. Most existing models of football player motion have not been\nvalidated yet with respect to actual data. One of the reasons for this lack is\nthat performing such a validation is not straightforward, because models of\nplayer motion are usually phrased in a way that emphasises possibly reachable\npositions rather than expected positions. Since positional data of football\nplayers typically contains outliers, this data may misrepresent the range of\nactually reachable positions.\nThis paper proposes a validation routine for trajectorial motion models that\nmeasures and optimises the ability of a motion model to accurately predict all\npossibly reachable positions by favoring the smallest predicted area of\nreachable positions that encompasses all observed reached positions up to a\nmanually defined threshold. We demonstrate validation and optimisation on four\ndifferent motion models, assuming (a) motion with constant speed, (b) motion\nwith constant acceleration, (c) motion with constant acceleration with a speed\nlimit, and (d) motion along two segments with constant speed. Our results show\nthat assuming motion with constant speed or constant acceleration without a\nlimit on the achievable speed is particularly inappropriate for an accurate\ndistinction between reachable and unreachable locations. Motion along two\nsegments of constant speed provides by far the highest accuracy among the\ntested models and serves as an efficient and accurate approximation of\nreal-world player motion.",

To resolve the\nsample efficiency issue in learning the high-dimensional and complex control of\ndexterous grasping, we propose an effective representation of grasping state\ncharacterizing the spatial interaction between the gripper and the target\nobject. To represent gripper-object interaction, we adopt Interaction Bisector\nSurface (IBS) which is the Voronoi diagram between two close by 3D geometric\nobjects and has been successfully applied in characterizing spatial relations\nbetween 3D objects. We found that IBS is surprisingly effective as a state\nrepresentation since it well informs the fine-grained control of each finger\nwith spatial relation against the target object. This novel grasp\nrepresentation, together with several technical contributions including a fast\nIBS approximation, a novel vector-based reward and an effective training\nstrategy, facilitate learning a strong control model of high-DOF grasping with\ngood sample efficiency, dynamic adaptability, and cross-category generality.\nExperiments show that it generates high-quality dexterous grasp for complex\nshapes with smooth grasping motions.",

    "abstract": "Student assessment is one of the most fundamental tasks in the field of AI\nEducation (AIEd). One of the most common approach to student assessment is\nKnowledge Tracing (KT), which evaluates a student's knowledge state by\npredicting whether the student will answer a given question correctly or not.\nHowever, in the context of multiple choice (polytomous) questions, conventional\nKT approaches are limited in that they only consider the binary (dichotomous)\ncorrectness label (i.e., correct or incorrect), and disregard the specific\noption chosen by the student. Meanwhile, Option Tracing (OT) attempts to model\na student by predicting which option they will choose for a given question, but\noverlooks the correctness information. In this paper, we propose\nDichotomous-Polytomous Multi-Task Learning (DP-MTL), a multi-task learning\nframework that combines KT and OT for more precise student assessment. In\nparticular, we show that the KT objective acts as a regularization term for OT\nin the DP-MTL framework, and propose an appropriate architecture for applying\nour method on top of existing deep learning-based KT models. We experimentally\nconfirm that DP-MTL significantly improves both KT and OT performances, and\nalso benefits downstream tasks such as Score Prediction (SP).",

    "title": "Exploration and Exploitation in Federated Learning to Exclude Clients  with Poisoned Data",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is one of the hot research topics, and it utilizes\nMachine Learning (ML) in a distributed manner without directly accessing\nprivate data on clients. However, FL faces many challenges, including the\ndifficulty to obtain high accuracy, high communication cost between clients and\nthe server, and security attacks related to adversarial ML. To tackle these\nthree challenges, we propose an FL algorithm inspired by evolutionary\ntechniques. The proposed algorithm groups clients randomly in many clusters,\neach with a model selected randomly to explore the performance of different\nmodels. The clusters are then trained in a repetitive process where the worst\nperforming cluster is removed in each iteration until one cluster remains. In\neach iteration, some clients are expelled from clusters either due to using\npoisoned data or low performance. The surviving clients are exploited in the\nnext iteration. The remaining cluster with surviving clients is then used for\ntraining the best FL model (i.e., remaining FL model). Communication cost is\nreduced since fewer clients are used in the final training of the FL model. To\nevaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conduct a number of\nexperiments using FEMNIST dataset and compare the result against the random FL\nalgorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm\noutperforms the baseline algorithm in terms of accuracy, communication cost,\nand security.",

Our\nproposed model combines several unique advantages: (i) Contrary to existing\napproaches that require large training datasets, we are able to identify\nphysical parameters from only a single video. (ii) The use of neural implicit\nrepresentations enables the processing of high-resolution videos and the\nsynthesis of photo-realistic images.

    "abstract": "Given two images of different anime roles, anime style recognition (ASR) aims\nto learn abstract painting style to determine whether the two images are from\nthe same work, which is an interesting but challenging problem. Unlike\nbiometric recognition, such as face recognition, iris recognition, and person\nre-identification, ASR suffers from a much larger semantic gap but receives\nless attention. In this paper, we propose a challenging ASR benchmark. Firstly,\nwe collect a large-scale ASR dataset (LSASRD), which contains 20,937 images of\n190 anime works and each work at least has ten different roles. In addition to\nthe large-scale, LSASRD contains a list of challenging factors, such as complex\nilluminations, various poses, theatrical colors and exaggerated compositions.\nSecondly, we design a cross-role protocol to evaluate ASR performance, in which\nquery and gallery images must come from different roles to validate an ASR\nmodel is to learn abstract painting style rather than learn discriminative\nfeatures of roles. Finally, we apply two powerful person re-identification\nmethods, namely, AGW and TransReID, to construct the baseline performance on\nLSASRD. Surprisingly, the recent transformer model (i.e., TransReID) only\nacquires a 42.24% mAP on LSASRD. Therefore, we believe that the ASR task of a\nhuge semantic gap deserves deep and long-term research. We will open our\ndataset and code at https://github.com/nkjcqvcpi/ASR.",

    "abstract": "Distribution can be a feature of the software evolution process. In other\nwords, temporally and spatially distributed teams and organizations can develop\nand work on a software application. The simplest case is to outsource\nproduction and employ workforce at distributed sites so that multiple\ndistributed teams can work on a project within a parallel framework. If this\ndistribution is global, it will be called the global software evolution or\ndevelopment. A higher level of distribution is defined as decentralization and\ndecentralized software evolution, which means that software development can be\nindependent of the initial provider. It also means that software execution is\nindependent of the initial provider and the initial system so that the software\napplication can easily be reused in different and new projects. However, the\nhigh level architecture is managed within a practically centralized framework\nin the decentralized software evolution. Most of the large scale open-source\nprojects are exemplars of this level. In terms of distribution, there is a\nhigher level of decentralized software evolution called \"distributed cognition\nand leadership\". At this level of distribution, all system levels evolve within\na distributed framework, and there are no centralized points in the project\nnetwork and its evolution process. Some open-source software applications are\nthe exemplars of this last level. Not only is the distributed software\nevolution faced with certain challenges and opportunities to reach its goals,\nbut it has also caused some challenges and opportunities in other fields. This\npaper conducts a general review of the distributed software evolution. For this\npurpose, the paper first addresses the importance of the distributed software\nevolution, and then introduces its noteworthy paradigms.",

So one axis agreement has been considered\nin this work (i.e., the robots agree on a direction and its orientation).

    "abstract": "Scene text image super-resolution (STISR) has been regarded as an important\npre-processing task for text recognition from low-resolution scene text images.\nMost recent approaches use the recognizer's feedback as clues to guide\nsuper-resolution. However, directly using recognition clue has two problems: 1)\nCompatibility. It is in the form of probability distribution, has an obvious\nmodal gap with STISR - a pixel-level task; 2) Inaccuracy. it usually contains\nwrong information, thus will mislead the main task and degrade super-resolution\nperformance. In this paper, we present a novel method C3-STISR that jointly\nexploits the recognizer's feedback, visual and linguistical information as\nclues to guide super-resolution. Here, visual clue is from the images of texts\npredicted by the recognizer, which is informative and more compatible with the\nSTISR task; while linguistical clue is generated by a pre-trained\ncharacter-level language model, which is able to correct the predicted texts.\nWe design effective extraction and fusion mechanisms for the triple cross-modal\nclues to generate a comprehensive and unified guidance for super-resolution.\nExtensive experiments on TextZoom show that C3-STISR outperforms the SOTA\nmethods in fidelity and recognition performance.

    "abstract": "Citizen science and machine learning should be considered for monitoring the\ncoastal and ocean environment due to the scale of threats posed by climate\nchange and the limited resources to fill knowledge gaps. Using data from the\nannotation activity of citizen scientists in a Swedish marine project, we\nconstructed Deep Neural Network models to predict forthcoming engagement. We\ntested the models to identify patterns in annotation engagement. Based on the\nresults, it is possible to predict whether an annotator will remain active in\nfuture sessions. Depending on the goals of individual citizen science projects,\nit may also be necessary to identify either those volunteers who will leave or\nthose who will continue annotating. This can be predicted by varying the\nthreshold for the prediction. The engagement metrics used to construct the\nmodels are based on time and activity and can be used to infer latent\ncharacteristics of volunteers and predict their task interest based on their\nactivity patterns. They can estimate if volunteers can accomplish a given\nnumber of tasks in a certain amount of time, identify early on who is likely to\nbecome a top contributor or identify who is likely to quit and provide them\nwith targeted interventions. The novelty of our predictive models lies in the\nuse of Deep Neural Networks and the sequence of volunteer annotations.

    "abstract": "Quality assessment for User Generated Content (UGC) videos plays an important\nrole in ensuring the viewing experience of end-users. Previous UGC video\nquality assessment (VQA) studies either use the image recognition model or the\nimage quality assessment (IQA) models to extract frame-level features of UGC\nvideos for quality regression, which are regarded as the sub-optimal solutions\nbecause of the domain shifts between these tasks and the UGC VQA task. In this\npaper, we propose a very simple but effective UGC VQA model, which tries to\naddress this problem by training an end-to-end spatial feature extraction\nnetwork to directly learn the quality-aware spatial feature representation from\nraw pixels of the video frames. We also extract the motion features to measure\nthe temporal-related distortions that the spatial features cannot model. The\nproposed model utilizes very sparse frames to extract spatial features and\ndense frames (i.e. the video chunk) with a very low spatial resolution to\nextract motion features, which thereby has low computational complexity. With\nthe better quality-aware features, we only use the simple multilayer perception\nlayer (MLP) network to regress them into the chunk-level quality scores, and\nthen the temporal average pooling strategy is adopted to obtain the video-level\nquality score. We further introduce a multi-scale quality fusion strategy to\nsolve the problem of VQA across different spatial resolutions, where the\nmulti-scale weights are obtained from the contrast sensitivity function of the\nhuman visual system. The experimental results show that the proposed model\nachieves the best performance on five popular UGC VQA databases, which\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model.

    "abstract": "We present an approach to learn voice-face representations from the talking\nface videos, without any identity labels. Previous works employ cross-modal\ninstance discrimination tasks to establish the correlation of voice and face.\nThese methods neglect the semantic content of different videos, introducing\nfalse-negative pairs as training noise. Furthermore, the positive pairs are\nconstructed based on the natural correlation between audio clips and visual\nframes. However, this correlation might be weak or inaccurate in a large amount\nof real-world data, which leads to deviating positives into the contrastive\nparadigm. To address these issues, we propose the cross-modal prototype\ncontrastive learning (CMPC), which takes advantage of contrastive methods and\nresists adverse effects of false negatives and deviate positives. On one hand,\nCMPC could learn the intra-class invariance by constructing semantic-wise\npositives via unsupervised clustering in different modalities. On the other\nhand, by comparing the similarities of cross-modal instances from that of\ncross-modal prototypes, we dynamically recalibrate the unlearnable instances'\ncontribution to overall loss. Experiments show that the proposed approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on various voice-face\nassociation evaluation protocols. Additionally, in the low-shot supervision\nsetting, our method also has a significant improvement compared to previous\ninstance-wise contrastive learning.",

    "abstract": "Directional area scattering factor (DASF) is a critical canopy structural\nparameter for vegetation monitoring. It provides an efficient tool for\ndecoupling of canopy structure and leaf optics from canopy reflectance. Current\nstandard approach to estimate DASF from canopy bidirectional reflectance factor\n(BRF) is based on the assumption that in the weakly absorbing 710 to 790 nm\nspectral interval, leaf scattering does not change much with the concentration\nof dry matter and thus its variation can be neglected. This results in biased\nestimates of DASF and consequently leads to uncertainty in DASF-related\napplications. This study proposes a new approach to account for variations in\nconcentrations of this biochemical constituent, which additionally uses the\ncanopy BRF at 2260 nm. In silico analysis of the proposed approach suggests\nsignificant increase in accuracy over the standard technique by a relative root\nmean square error (rRMSE) of 49% and 34% for one- and three dimensional scenes,\nrespectively. When compared with indoor multi-angular hyperspectral\nmeasurements reported in literature, the mean absolute error has reduced by 68%\nfor needle leaf and 20% for broadleaf canopies. Thus, the proposed DASF\nestimation approach outperforms the current one and can be used more reliably\nin DASF-related applications, such as vegetation monitoring of functional\ntraits, dynamics, and radiation budget.",

In\naddition to predicting the yield, we demonstrated the model's ability to\nsuggest the optimum (highest yield) reaction conditions.

The main contribution is the controlled fault data generation that\nenables to generate unobserved fault types and severity levels in the target\ndomain by having only access to the healthy samples in the target domain and\nfaulty samples in the source domain. To evaluate the ability of the proposed\nmethod to bridge domain gaps in different domain adaption settings, we conduct\nPartial as well as OpenSet&Partial domain adaptation experiments on two bearing\nfault diagnostics case studies.

As many medical topics have limited annotated textual\ndata in practical settings, FSL-based natural language processing (NLP) methods\nhold substantial promise. We aimed to conduct a systematic review to explore\nthe state of FSL methods for medical NLP. Materials and Methods: We searched\nfor articles published between January 2016 and August 2021 using\nPubMed/Medline, Embase, ACL Anthology, and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. To\nidentify the latest relevant methods, we also searched other sources such as\npreprint servers (eg., medRxiv) via Google Scholar. We included all articles\nthat involved FSL and any type of medical text. We abstracted articles based on\ndata source(s), aim(s), training set size(s), primary method(s)/approach(es),\nand evaluation method(s). Results: 31 studies met our inclusion criteria-all\npublished after 2018; 22 (71%) since 2020. Concept extraction/named entity\nrecognition was the most frequently addressed task (13/31; 42%), followed by\ntext classification (10/31; 32%). Twenty-one (68%) studies reconstructed\nexisting datasets to create few-shot scenarios synthetically, and MIMIC-III was\nthe most frequently used dataset (7/31; 23%). Common methods included FSL with\nattention mechanisms (12/31; 39%), prototypical networks (8/31; 26%), and\nmeta-learning (6/31; 19%). Discussion: Despite the potential for FSL in\nbiomedical NLP, progress has been limited compared to domain-independent FSL.\nThis may be due to the paucity of standardized, public datasets, and the\nrelative underperformance of FSL methods on biomedical topics. Creation and\nrelease of specialized datasets for biomedical FSL may aid method development\nby enabling comparative analyses.",

While such a paradigm typically optimizes the classification and\nregression independently, leading to task misalignment (accurate prediction\nboxes have no high target confidence scores). In this paper, to alleviate this\nmisalignment, we propose a novel tracking paradigm, called SiamLA. Within this\nparadigm, a series of simple, yet effective localization-aware components are\nintroduced, to generate localization-aware target confidence scores.\nSpecifically, with the proposed localization-aware dynamic label (LADL) loss\nand localization-aware label smoothing (LALS) strategy, collaborative\noptimization between the classification and regression is achieved, enabling\nclassification scores to be aware of location state, not just appearance\nsimilarity. Besides, we propose a separate localization branch, centered on a\nlocalization-aware feature aggregation (LAFA) module, to produce location\nquality scores to further modify the classification scores. Consequently, the\nresulting target confidence scores, are more discriminative for the location\nstate, allowing accurate prediction boxes tend to be predicted as high scores.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on six challenging benchmarks, including\nGOT-10k, TrackingNet, LaSOT, TNL2K, OTB100 and VOT2018.

To address\nthese issues, here we introduce PyramidCLIP, which constructs an input pyramid\nwith different semantic levels, and aligns visual elements and linguistic\nelements in the form of hierarchy via intra-level semantics alignment and\ncross-level relation alignment. Furthermore, we adjust the objective function\nby softening the loss of negative samples (unpaired samples) so as to weaken\nthe strict constraint during the pre-training stage, thus mitigating the risk\nof the model being over-confident. Experiments on three downstream tasks,\nincluding zero-shot image classification, zero-shot image-text retrieval and\nimage object detection, verify the effectiveness of the proposed PyramidCLIP.\nIn particular, with the same amount of pre-training data of 15 millions\nimage-text pairs, PyramidCLIP exceeds CLIP by 19.2%/18.5%/19.6% respectively,\nwith the image encoder being ResNet-50/ViT-B32/ViT-B16 on ImageNet zero-shot\nclassification top-1 accuracy. When scaling to larger datasets, the results of\nPyramidCLIP only trained for 8 epochs using 128M image-text pairs are very\nclose to that of CLIP trained for 32 epochs using 400M training data.",

However, the automatic classification of CSAM is a challenging\nfield of research, largely due to the inaccessibility of target data that is -\nand should forever be - private and in sole possession of law enforcement\nagencies. To aid researchers in drawing insights from unseen data and safely\nproviding further understanding of CSAM images, we propose an analysis template\nthat goes beyond the statistics of the dataset and respective labels. It\nfocuses on the extraction of automatic signals, provided both by pre-trained\nmachine learning models, e.g., object categories and pornography detection, as\nwell as image metrics such as luminance and sharpness. Only aggregated\nstatistics of sparse signals are provided to guarantee the anonymity of\nchildren and adolescents victimized. The pipeline allows filtering the data by\napplying thresholds to each specified signal and provides the distribution of\nsuch signals within the subset, correlations between signals, as well as a bias\nevaluation. We demonstrated our proposal on the Region-based annotated Child\nPornography Dataset (RCPD), one of the few CSAM benchmarks in the literature,\ncomposed of over 2000 samples among regular and CSAM images, produced in\npartnership with Brazil's Federal Police. Although noisy and limited in several\nsenses, we argue that automatic signals can highlight important aspects of the\noverall distribution of data, which is valuable for databases that can not be\ndisclosed.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a discrete-time information-update system, where a\nservice provider can proactively retrieve information from the information\nsource to update its data and users query the data at the service provider. One\nexample is crowdsensing-based applications. In order to keep users satisfied,\nthe application desires to provide users with fresh data, where the freshness\nis measured by the Age-of-Information (AoI). However, maintaining fresh data\nrequires the application to update its database frequently, which incurs an\nupdate cost (e.g., incentive payment). Hence, there exists a natural tradeoff\nbetween the AoI and the update cost at the service provider who needs to make\nupdate decisions. To capture this tradeoff, we formulate an optimization\nproblem with the objective of minimizing the total cost, which is the sum of\nthe staleness cost (which is a function of the AoI) and the update cost. Then,\nwe provide two useful guidelines for the design of efficient update policies.\nFollowing these guidelines and assuming that the aggregated request arrival\nprocess is Bernoulli, we prove that there exists a threshold-based policy that\nis optimal among all online policies and thus focus on the class of\nthreshold-based policies. Furthermore, we derive the closed-form formula for\ncomputing the long-term average cost under any threshold-based policy and\nobtain the optimal threshold. Finally, we perform extensive simulations using\nboth synthetic data and real traces to verify our theoretical results and\ndemonstrate the superior performance of the optimal threshold-based policy\ncompared with several baseline policies.",

In this work, we identify and construct an\nexplicit set of neural network classifiers that achieve optimality. Since\neffective neural networks in practice are typically both wide and deep, we\nanalyze infinitely wide networks that are also infinitely deep. In particular,\nusing the recent connection between infinitely wide neural networks and Neural\nTangent Kernels, we provide explicit activation functions that can be used to\nconstruct networks that achieve optimality. Interestingly, these activation\nfunctions are simple and easy to implement, yet differ from commonly used\nactivations such as ReLU or sigmoid. More generally, we create a taxonomy of\ninfinitely wide and deep networks and show that these models implement one of\nthree well-known classifiers depending on the activation function used: (1)\n1-nearest neighbor (model predictions are given by the label of the nearest\ntraining example); (2) majority vote (model predictions are given by the label\nof the class with greatest representation in the training set); or (3) singular\nkernel classifiers (a set of classifiers containing those that achieve\noptimality).

    "abstract": "Internet-scale distributed systems often replicate data at multiple\ngeographic locations to provide low latency and high availability. The\nConflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) is a framework that provides a\nprincipled approach to maintaining eventual consistency among data replicas.\nCRDTs have been notoriously difficult to design and implement correctly. Subtle\ndeep bugs lie in the complex and tedious handling of all possible cases of\nconflicting data updates. We argue that the CRDT design should be formally\nspecified and model-checked to uncover deep bugs. The implementation further\nneeds to be systematically tested. On the one hand, the testing needs to\ninherit the exhaustive nature of the model checking and ensures the coverage of\ntesting. On the other hand, the testing is expected to find coding errors which\ncannot be detected by design level verification.\nTowards the challenges above, we propose the Model Checking-driven\nExplorative Testing (MET) framework. At the design level, MET uses TLA+ to\nspecify and model check CRDT designs. At the implementation level, MET conducts\nmodel checking-driven explorative testing, in the sense that the test cases are\nautomatically generated from the model checking traces. The system execution is\ncontrolled to proceed deterministically, following the model checking trace.\nThe explorative testing systematically controls and permutes all\nnondeterministic message reorderings.\nWe apply MET in our practical development of CRDTs. The bugs in both designs\nand implementations of CRDTs are found. As for bugs which can be found by\ntraditional testing techniques, MET greatly reduces the cost of fixing the\nbugs. Moreover, MET can find subtle deep bugs which cannot be found by existing\ntechniques at a reasonable cost. We further discuss how MET provides us with\nsufficient confidence in the correctness of our CRDT designs and\nimplementations.",

As\na result, local optimization with hand-tuned heuristic methods from human\nexperts are often adopted in practice.

In this work, we propose a synthetic dataset,\ncontaining SVCs in the form of images as well as ground truths. We show the\nusage of this dataset by an application that automatically extracts a graph\nrepresentation from an SVC image. This is done by training a model via common\nsupervised learning methods. As there currently exist no large-scale public\ndatasets for the detailed analysis of SVC, we propose the Synthetic SVC (SSVC)\ndataset comprising 12,000 images with respective bounding box annotations and\ndetailed graph representations.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of approximating the edit distance of two strings in\nsublinear time, in a setting where one or both string(s) are preprocessed, as\ninitiated by Goldenberg, Rubinstein, Saha (STOC '20). Specifically, in the $(k,\nK)$-gap edit distance problem, the goal is to distinguish whether the edit\ndistance of two strings is at most $k$ or at least $K$. We obtain the following\nresults:\n* After preprocessing one string in time $n^{1+o(1)}$, we can solve $(k, k\n\\cdot n^{o(1)})$-gap edit distance in time $(n/k + k) \\cdot n^{o(1)}$.\n* After preprocessing both strings separately in time $n^{1+o(1)}$, we can\nsolve $(k, k \\cdot n^{o(1)})$-gap edit distance in time $k \\cdot n^{o(1)}$.\nBoth results improve upon some previously best known result, with respect to\neither the gap or the query time or the preprocessing time.\nOur algorithms build on the framework by Andoni, Krauthgamer and Onak (FOCS\n'10) and the recent sublinear-time algorithm by Bringmann, Cassis, Fischer and\nNakos (STOC '22). We replace many complicated parts in their algorithm by\nfaster and simpler solutions which exploit the preprocessing.",

    "title": "FRANCIS: Fast Reaction Algorithms for Network Coordination In Switches",
    "abstract": "Distributed protocols are widely used to support network functions such as\nclock synchronization and multicast. As the network gets larger and faster, it\nis increasingly challenging for these protocols to react quickly to network\nevents. The theory community has made significant progress in developing\ndistributed message passing algorithms with improved convergence times. With\nthe emerging programmability at switches, it now becomes feasible to adopt and\nadapt these theoretical advances for networking functions. In this paper, we\npropose FRANCIS, a new framework for running message passing algorithms on\nprogrammable switches to enable fast reactions to network events in large\nnetworks. We introduce an execution engine with computing and communication\nprimitives for supporting message passing algorithms in P4 switches. We\nexemplify the framework's usefulness by improving the resiliency and reaction\ntimes of clock synchronization and source-routed multicast. In particular, our\napproach allows lower clock drift than Sundial and PTP, quickly recovers from\nmultiple failures, and reduces the time uncertainty bound by up to 5x. Compared\nwith state-of-the-art multicast solutions, our approach uses packet headers up\nto 33\\% smaller and has an order of magnitude faster reaction time.",

Our experiments used 3 separate\nfeature sets across 4 wetland sites as input into 8 candidate machine learning\nalgorithms, providing 96 sets of experimental configurations.

    "abstract": "Pretrained language models often do not perform tasks in ways that are in\nline with our preferences, e.g., generating offensive text or factually\nincorrect summaries. Recent work approaches the above issue by learning from a\nsimple form of human evaluation: comparisons between pairs of model-generated\ntask outputs. Comparison feedback conveys limited information about human\npreferences per human evaluation. Here, we propose to learn from natural\nlanguage feedback, which conveys more information per human evaluation. We\nlearn from language feedback on model outputs using a three-step learning\nalgorithm. First, we condition the language model on the initial output and\nfeedback to generate many refinements. Second, we choose the refinement with\nthe highest similarity to the feedback. Third, we finetune a language model to\nmaximize the likelihood of the chosen refinement given the input. In synthetic\nexperiments, we first evaluate whether language models accurately incorporate\nfeedback to produce refinements, finding that only large language models (175B\nparameters) do so. Using only 100 samples of human-written feedback, our\nlearning algorithm finetunes a GPT-3 model to roughly human-level\nsummarization.",

However, tracking these small\nsatellites still depends on ground-based operations. Autonomous navigation\ncould be a possible solution considering challenges presented by costly ground\noperations and limited onboard power available for small satellites. There have\nbeen various studies on autonomous navigation methods for cislunar missions.\nOne of them, LiAISON, provides an autonomous orbit determination solution\nsolely using inter-satellite measurements. This study aims at providing a\ndetailed performance analysis of crosslink radiometric measurements based on\nautonomous orbit determination for cislunar small satellite formations\nconsidering the effects of measurement type, measurement accuracy, bias,\nformation geometry, and network topology. This study shows that range\nobservations provide better state estimation accuracy than range-rate\nobservations for the autonomous navigation system in cislunar space.\nLine-of-sight angle measurements derived from radiometric measurements do not\nimprove the overall system performance. In addition, less precise crosslink\nmeasurement methods could be an option for formations in the high observable\norbital configurations. It was found that measurement biases and measurements\nwith high intervals reduce the overall system performance.

In this paper, the outage performance of uplink\nRSMA transmission with randomly deployed users is investigated, taking both\nuser scheduling schemes and power allocation strategies into consideration.\nSpecifically, the greedy user scheduling (GUS) and cumulative distribution\nfunction (CDF) based user scheduling (CUS) schemes are considered, which could\nmaximize the rate performance and guarantee access fairness, respectively.\nMeanwhile, we re-investigate cognitive power allocation (CPA) strategy, and\npropose a new rate-fairness oriented power allocation (FPA) strategy to enhance\nthe scheduled users rate fairness. By employing order statistics and stochastic\ngeometry, an analytical expression of the outage probability for each\nscheduling scheme combining power allocation is derived to characterize the\nperformance. To get more insights, the achieved diversity order of each scheme\nis also derived. Theoretical results demonstrate that both GUS and CUS schemes\napplying CPA or FPA strategy can achieve full diversity orders, and the\napplication of CPA strategy in RSMA can effectively eliminate the secondary\nuser's diversity order constraint from the primary user.

    "abstract": "This study presents an autonomous orbit determination system based on\ncrosslink radiometric measurements applied to a future lunar CubeSat mission to\nclearly highlight its advantages with respect to existing ground-based\nnavigation strategies. This work is based on the Linked Autonomous\nInterplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAISON) method which provides an\nautonomous navigation solution solely using satellite-to-satellite\nmeasurements, such as range and/or range-rate, to estimate absolute spacecraft\nstates when at least one of the involved spacecraft has an orbit with a unique\nsize, shape, and orientation. The lunar vicinity is a perfect candidate for\nthis type of application due to the asymmetrical gravity field: the selected\nlunar mission, an Earth-Moon L2 (EML2) Halo orbiter, has an inter-satellite\nlink between a lunar elliptical frozen orbiter. Simulation results show that,\neven in case of high-measurement errors (in the order of 100 m, 1 sigma, the\nnavigation filter estimates the true states of spacecraft at EML2 with an error\nin the order of 500 m for position, and 2 mm/s for velocity, respectively and\nthe elliptical lunar frozen orbiter states can be estimated in the order of 100\nm for position and 1 cm/s for velocity, respectively. This study shows that\nrange-only measurements provide better state estimation than range-rate-only\nmeasurements for this specific situation. Different bias handling strategies\nare also investigated. It has been found that even a less accurate ranging\nmethod, such as data-aided ranging, provides a sufficient orbit determination\nsolution. This would simplify the communication system design for the selected\nCubeSat mission. The most observable states are found to be position states of\nthe lunar orbiter via the observability analysis.

For example, dynamic race detection\nrelies on efficient \"on-the-fly\" determination of dependencies between\nsequential and parallel tasks (e.g. to quickly determine whether or not two\nmemory accesses occur in parallel). Several solutions to this \"parallel order\nmaintenance\" problem has been proposed, but they all have several drawbacks,\nincluding lack of provable bounds, high asymptotic or practical overheads, and\npoor support for parallel execution.\nIn this paper, we present a solution to the parallel order maintenance\nproblem that is provably efficient, fully parallel, and practical. Our\nalgorithm -- called DePa -- represents a computation as a graph and encodes\nvertices in the graph with two components: a dag-depth and a fork-path. In this\nencoding, each query requires $O(f/\\omega)$ work, where $f$ is the minimum\ndynamic nesting depth of the two vertices compared, and $\\omega$ is the\nword-size. In the common case (where $f$ is small, e.g., less than 100), each\nquery requires only a single memory lookup and a small constant number of\nbitwise instructions.

    "abstract": "Data integration has been recently challenged by the need to handle large\nvolumes of data, arriving at high velocity from a variety of sources, which\ndemonstrate varying levels of veracity. This challenging setting, often\nreferred to as big data, renders many of the existing techniques, especially\nthose that are human-intensive, obsolete. Big data also produces technological\nadvancements such as Internet of things, cloud computing, and deep learning,\nand accordingly, provides a new, exciting, and challenging research agenda.\nGiven the availability of data and the improvement of machine learning\ntechniques, this blog discusses the respective roles of humans and machines in\nachieving cognitive tasks in matching, aiming to determine whether traditional\nroles of humans and machines are subject to change. Such investigation, we\nbelieve, will pave a way to better utilize both human and machine resources in\nnew and innovative manners. We shall discuss two possible modes of change,\nnamely humans out and humans in. Humans out aim at exploring out-of-the-box\nlatent matching reasoning using machine learning algorithms when attempting to\noverpower human matcher performance. Pursuing out-of-the-box thinking, machine\nand deep learning can be involved in matching. Humans in explores how to better\ninvolve humans in the matching loop by assigning human matchers with a\nsymmetric role to algorithmic matcher in the matching process.",

    "abstract": "DETR-style detectors stand out amongst in-domain scenarios, but their\nproperties in domain shift settings are under-explored. This paper aims to\nbuild a simple but effective baseline with a DETR-style detector on domain\nshift settings based on two findings. For one, mitigating the domain shift on\nthe backbone and the decoder output features excels in getting favorable\nresults. For another, advanced domain alignment methods in both parts further\nenhance the performance. Thus, we propose the Object-Aware Alignment (OAA)\nmodule and the Optimal Transport based Alignment (OTA) module to achieve\ncomprehensive domain alignment on the outputs of the backbone and the detector.\nThe OAA module aligns the foreground regions identified by pseudo-labels in the\nbackbone outputs, leading to domain-invariant based features. The OTA module\nutilizes sliced Wasserstein distance to maximize the retention of location\ninformation while minimizing the domain gap in the decoder outputs. We\nimplement the findings and the alignment modules into our adaptation method,\nand it benchmarks the DETR-style detector on the domain shift settings.\nExperiments on various domain adaptive scenarios validate the effectiveness of\nour method.",

For the frictionless\nlateral beam-to-beam contact, a surface-to-surface contact algorithm combined\nwith an active set strategy and a penalty method is employed. The lateral\nboundary surface of the beam is parameterized by its axis and cross-sectional\nboundary curves with NURBS basis functions having at least $C^2$-continuity,\nwhich yields a continuous surface metric and curvature for the closest point\nprojection. Three-dimensional constitutive laws of hyperelastic materials are\nconsidered.

    "abstract": "Building models that can be rapidly adapted to numerous tasks using only a\nhandful of annotated examples is an open challenge for multimodal machine\nlearning research. We introduce Flamingo, a family of Visual Language Models\n(VLM) with this ability. Flamingo models include key architectural innovations\nto: (i) bridge powerful pretrained vision-only and language-only models, (ii)\nhandle sequences of arbitrarily interleaved visual and textual data, and (iii)\nseamlessly ingest images or videos as inputs. Thanks to their flexibility,\nFlamingo models can be trained on large-scale multimodal web corpora containing\narbitrarily interleaved text and images, which is key to endow them with\nin-context few-shot learning capabilities. We perform a thorough evaluation of\nthe proposed Flamingo models, exploring and measuring their ability to rapidly\nadapt to a variety of image and video understanding benchmarks. These include\nopen-ended tasks such as visual question-answering, where the model is prompted\nwith a question which it has to answer, captioning tasks, which evaluate the\nability to describe a scene or an event, and close-ended tasks such as multiple\nchoice visual question-answering. For tasks lying anywhere on this spectrum, we\ndemonstrate that a single Flamingo model can achieve a new state of the art for\nfew-shot learning, simply by prompting the model with task-specific examples.\nOn many of these benchmarks, Flamingo actually surpasses the performance of\nmodels that are fine-tuned on thousands of times more task-specific data.",

This is\nespecially a challenging problem because the research community still lacks a\ncoherent dataset for assessing the adaptability of LMs to frequently-updated\nknowledge corpus such as Wikipedia. To this end, we introduce TemporalWiki, a\nlifelong benchmark for ever-evolving LMs that utilizes the difference between\nconsecutive snapshots of English Wikipedia and English Wikidata for training\nand evaluation, respectively. The benchmark hence allows researchers to\nperiodically track an LM's ability to retain previous knowledge and acquire\nupdated/new knowledge at each point in time. We also find that training an LM\non the diff data through continual learning methods achieves similar or better\nperplexity than on the entire snapshot in our benchmark with 12 times less\ncomputational cost, which verifies that factual knowledge in LMs can be safely\nupdated with minimal training data via continual learning.

    "abstract": "Range and charge anxiety remain essential barriers to a faster electric\nvehicle market diffusion. To this end, quickly and reliably finding suitable\ncharging stations may foster an electric vehicle uptake by mitigating drivers'\nanxieties. Here, existing commercial services help drivers to find available\nstations based on real-time availability data but struggle with data\ninaccuracy, e.g., due to conventional vehicles blocking the access to public\ncharging stations. In this context, recent works have studied stochastic search\nmethods to account for availability uncertainty in order to minimize a driver's\ndetour until reaching an available charging station. So far, both practical and\ntheoretical approaches ignore driver coordination enabled by charging requests\ncentralization or sharing of data, e.g., sharing observations of charging\nstations' availability or visit intentions between drivers. Against this\nbackground, we study coordinated stochastic search algorithms, which help to\nreduce station visit conflicts and improve the drivers' charging experience. We\nmodel a multi-agent stochastic charging station search problem as a\nfinite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce an online solution\nframework applicable to static and dynamic policies. In contrast to static\npolicies, dynamic policies account for information updates during policy\nplanning and execution. We present a hierarchical implementation of a\nsingle-agent heuristic for decentralized decision making and a rollout\nalgorithm for centralized decision making. Extensive numerical studies show\nthat compared to an uncoordinated setting, a decentralized setting with\nvisit-intentions sharing decreases the system cost by 26%, which is nearly as\ngood as the 28% cost decrease achieved in a centralized setting, and saves up\nto 23% of a driver's search time while increasing her search reliability.",

However, in many real-world optimization problems, the computations of\nthe objective function or constraints involve computationally expensive\nnumerical simulations or physical experiments. Surrogate-assisted evolutionary\nalgorithms (SAEAs) have recently gained increased attention because of their\nsearch capabilities for solving these computationally expensive optimization\nproblems. The main idea of SAEAs is the integration of an evolutionary\nalgorithm with a selected surrogate model. In this paper, we propose a novel\nsurrogate model based on a Lipschitz underestimation of the\nexpensive-to-compute objective function. We also develop a differential\nevolution-based algorithm, that utilizes the Lipschitz-based surrogate model,\nalong with a standard radial basis function surrogate model and a local search\nprocedure. This algorithm, called Lipschitz Surrogate-assisted Differential\nEvolution (LSADE), is designed for high-dimensional computationally expensive\nproblems. The experimental results on seven benchmark functions of dimensions\n30, 50, 100, and 200 show that the proposed method utilizing the\nLipschitz-based surrogate model is competitive compared with the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms under a limited computational budget, being\nespecially effective for the very complicated benchmark functions in high\ndimensions.",

The code generation process involves the selection of adequate code\ntransformations, tuning parameters, and parallelization strategies. We propose\nan alternative to time-intensive autotuning, scenario-specific performance\nmodels, or black-box machine learning to select the best-performing\nconfiguration.\nThis paper identifies the relevant performance-defining mechanisms for\nmemory-intensive GPU applications through a performance model coupled with an\nanalytic hardware metric estimator. This enables a quick exploration of large\nconfiguration spaces to identify highly efficient code candidates with high\naccuracy.\nWe examine the changes of the A100 GPU architecture compared to the\npredecessor V100 and address the challenges of how to model the data transfer\nvolumes through the new memory hierarchy.\nWe show how our method can be coupled to the pystencils stencil code\ngenerator, which is used to generate kernels for a range-four 3D-25pt stencil\nand a complex two-phase fluid solver based on the Lattice Boltzmann Method. For\nboth, it delivers a ranking that can be used to select the best-performing\ncandidate.\nThe method is not limited to stencil kernels but can be integrated into any\ncode generator that can generate the required address expressions.",

    "abstract": "Semantic parsing is an important NLP problem, particularly for voice\nassistants such as Alexa and Google Assistant. State-of-the-art (SOTA) semantic\nparsers are seq2seq architectures based on large language models that have been\npretrained on vast amounts of text. To better leverage that pretraining, recent\nwork has explored a reformulation of semantic parsing whereby the output\nsequences are themselves natural language sentences, but in a controlled\nfragment of natural language. This approach delivers strong results,\nparticularly for few-shot semantic parsing, which is of key importance in\npractice and the focus of our paper. We push this line of work forward by\nintroducing an automated methodology that delivers very significant additional\nimprovements by utilizing modest amounts of unannotated data, which is\ntypically easy to obtain. Our method is based on a novel synthesis of four\ntechniques: joint training with auxiliary unsupervised tasks; constrained\ndecoding; self-training; and paraphrasing. We show that this method delivers\nnew SOTA few-shot performance on the Overnight dataset, particularly in very\nlow-resource settings, and very compelling few-shot results on a new semantic\nparsing dataset.",

In the previous attempt of (Sealfon 2016}, by adding Laplace noise to\neach edge weight or to each output distance, to achieve DP with some fixed\nbudget, with high probability the maximal absolute error among all published\npairwise distances is roughly $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of nodes. It was\nshown that this error could be reduced for some special graphs, which, however,\nis hard for general graphs. Therefore, whether the approximation error can be\nreduced to sublinear in $n$ is posted as an interesting open problem.\nWe break the linear barrier on the distance approximation error of previous\nresult, by proposing an algorithm that releases a constructed synthetic graph\nprivately. Computing all pairwise distances on the constructed graph only\nintroduces $\\tilde O(n^{1/2})$ error in answering all pairwise shortest path\ndistances for fixed privacy parameter. Our method is based on a novel graph\ndiameter (link length) augmentation via constructing \"shortcuts\" for the paths.\nBy adding a set of shortcut edges to the original graph, we show that any node\npair has a shortest path with link length $\\tilde O(n^{1/2})$. Then by adding\nnoises with some positive mean to the edge weights, we show that the new graph\nis differentially private and can be published to answer all pairwise shortest\npath distances with $\\tilde O(n^{1/2})$ approximation error using standard APSP\ncomputation.\nAdditionally, we consider the graph with small feedback vertex set number. A\nfeedback vertex set (FVS) of a graph is a set of vertices whose removal leaves\na graph without cycles, and the feedback vertex set number of a graph, $k$, is\nthe size of a smallest feedback vertex set.

    "abstract": "Aircraft collision avoidance systems have long been a key factor in keeping\nour airspace safe. Over the past decade, the FAA has supported the development\nof a new family of collision avoidance systems called the Airborne Collision\nAvoidance System X (ACAS X), which model the collision avoidance problem as a\nMarkov decision process (MDP). Variants of ACAS X have been created for both\nmanned (ACAS Xa) and unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu and ACAS sXu). The variants\nprimarily differ in the types of collision avoidance maneuvers they issue. For\nexample, ACAS Xa issues vertical collision avoidance advisories, while ACAS Xu\nand ACAS sXu allow for horizontal advisories due to reduced aircraft\nperformance capabilities. Currently, a new variant of ACAS X, called ACAS Xr,\nis being developed to provide collision avoidance capability to rotorcraft and\nAdvanced Air Mobility (AAM) vehicles. Due to the desire to minimize deviation\nfrom the prescribed flight path of these aircraft, speed adjustments have been\nproposed as a potential collision avoidance maneuver for aircraft using ACAS\nXr. In this work, we investigate the effect of speed change advisories on the\nsafety and operational efficiency of collision avoidance systems. We develop an\nMDP-based collision avoidance logic that issues speed advisories and compare\nits performance to that of horizontal and vertical logics through Monte Carlo\nsimulation on existing airspace encounter models. Our results show that while\nspeed advisories are able to reduce collision risk, they are neither as safe\nnor as efficient as their horizontal and vertical counterparts.",

However, the process of converting\nopen-ended analytic questions into testable hypotheses is complex and often\nill-defined. Beyond high-level descriptions, the visual analytics literature\nlacks a formalization that can be operationalized for analysis and automation.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel grammar to express hypothesis-based analytic\nquestions for visual analysis. Drawing from prior work in science and\neducation, our grammar defines a formal way to express sets of verifiable\nhypotheses as a \"hypothesis space\". Our proposed use of hypothesis spaces\ncontributes a new lens to unify concepts of user goals, the capabilities of a\ndataset, visual analysis, and testable hypotheses. As a result, we can\nreformulate abstract classes of visual analysis goals, such as analytic and\ndata-related tasks, in a way that is suitable for analysis and automation. We\ndemonstrate use cases of our grammar in real-world analytic applications\nincluding VAST challenges, Kaggle competitions, and pre-existing task\ntaxonomies.

However, the\nmost natural way that human seek or test their knowledge is via human\nconversations. Therefore, we propose a new Spoken Conversational Question\nAnswering task (SCQA), aiming at enabling the systems to model complex dialogue\nflows given the speech documents. In this task, our main objective is to build\nthe system to deal with conversational questions based on the audio recordings,\nand to explore the plausibility of providing more cues from different\nmodalities with systems in information gathering. To this end, instead of\ndirectly adopting automatically generated speech transcripts with highly noisy\ndata, we propose a novel unified data distillation approach, DDNet, which\neffectively ingests cross-modal information to achieve fine-grained\nrepresentations of the speech and language modalities. Moreover, we propose a\nsimple and novel mechanism, termed Dual Attention, by encouraging better\nalignments between audio and text to ease the process of knowledge transfer. To\nevaluate the capacity of SCQA systems in a dialogue-style interaction, we\nassemble a Spoken Conversational Question Answering (Spoken-CoQA) dataset with\nmore than 40k question-answer pairs from 4k conversations.

In this work, we propose the MQT Bench benchmark\nsuite (as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)) based on four core traits:\n(1) cross-level support for different abstraction levels, (2) accessibility via\nan easy to use web interface (https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/mqtbench), (3)\nprovision of a broad selection of benchmarks to facilitate generalizability, as\nwell as (4) extendability to future algorithms, gate-sets, and hardware\narchitectures. By comprising more than 30.000 benchmark circuits ranging from 2\nup to 130 qubits on four abstraction levels, MQT Bench presents a first step\ntowards benchmarking different abstraction levels with a single benchmark\nsuite.",

    "title": "One Model to Synthesize Them All: Multi-contrast Multi-scale Transformer  for Missing Data Imputation",
    "abstract": "Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used in clinical\npractice as each contrast provides complementary information. However, the\navailability of each contrast may vary amongst patients in reality. This poses\nchallenges to both radiologists and automated image analysis algorithms. A\ngeneral approach for tackling this problem is missing data imputation, which\naims to synthesize the missing contrasts from existing ones. While several\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) based algorithms have been proposed, they\nsuffer from the fundamental limitations of CNN models, such as requirement for\nfixed numbers of input and output channels, inability to capture long-range\ndependencies, and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we formulate missing\ndata imputation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem and propose a\nmulti-contrast multi-scale Transformer (MMT), which can take any subset of\ninput contrasts and synthesize those that are missing. MMT consists of a\nmulti-scale Transformer encoder that builds hierarchical representations of\ninputs combined with a multi-scale Transformer decoder that generates the\noutputs in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Thanks to the proposed multi-contrast Swin\nTransformer blocks, it can efficiently capture intra- and inter-contrast\ndependencies for accurate image synthesis. Moreover, MMT is inherently\ninterpretable. It allows us to understand the importance of each input contrast\nin different regions by analyzing the in-built attention maps of Transformer\nblocks in the decoder. Extensive experiments on two large-scale multi-contrast\nMRI datasets demonstrate that MMT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods\nquantitatively and qualitatively.",

Traditionally, the selection of\nappropriate maskers and gain levels has been informed by expert opinion, which\nmay not representative of the target population, or by listening tests, which\ncan be time-consuming and labour-intensive.

    "abstract": "Photoacoustic (PA) imaging has been widely applied in both preclinical and\nclinical applications. With a significantly increasing number of data\nacquisition channels, fast and high-quality image reconstruction for real-time\nPA imaging is an open challenge in this community. In this paper, we propose a\nFPGA-accelerated method to achieve a much faster image reconstruction speed by\n20~60 times compared with using CPU, with much-reduced system cost and power\nbudget, from dozens of Watt (CPU) to 1~2 Watt (FPGA). Equivalently, the energy\nefficiency ratio (EER) is improved by ~1000 times. This FPGA acceleration\nmethod can be easily adapted to the most widely used algorithms, such as\ndelay-and-sum (DAS) and its variants (e.g. DMAS, DAS-CF). We have performed\nin-vivo human finger experiments to demonstrate the feasibility and potential\nof the proposed method. To our best knowledge, this is the first study of\naccelerating PA image reconstruction based on FPGA platform.",

However, optimal VAR model order selection methods,\ncommonly relying on the Akaike or Bayesian Information Criteria (AIC/BIC), are\ntypically not designed for multi-trial data. Here we derive the BIC methods for\nmulti-trial ensemble data which are gathered after the detection of the events.\nWe show using simulated bivariate AR models that the multi-trial BIC is able to\nrecover the real model order. We also demonstrate with simulated transient\nevents and real data that the multi-trial BIC is able to estimate a\nsufficiently small model order for dynamic system modeling.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel adversarial distortion learning (ADL) for denoising two-\nand three-dimensional (2D/3D) biomedical image data. The proposed ADL consists\nof two auto-encoders: a denoiser and a discriminator. The denoiser removes\nnoise from input data and the discriminator compares the denoised result to its\nnoise-free counterpart. This process is repeated until the discriminator cannot\ndifferentiate the denoised data from the reference. Both the denoiser and the\ndiscriminator are built upon a proposed auto-encoder called Efficient-Unet.\nEfficient-Unet has a light architecture that uses the residual blocks and a\nnovel pyramidal approach in the backbone to efficiently extract and re-use\nfeature maps. During training, the textural information and contrast are\ncontrolled by two novel loss functions. The architecture of Efficient-Unet\nallows generalizing the proposed method to any sort of biomedical data. The 2D\nversion of our network was trained on ImageNet and tested on biomedical\ndatasets whose distribution is completely different from ImageNet; so, there is\nno need for re-training. Experimental results carried out on magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI), dermatoscopy, electron microscopy and X-ray datasets show that\nthe proposed method achieved the best on each benchmark.

    "abstract": "Interacting particle system (IPS) models have proven to be highly successful\nfor describing the spatial movement of organisms. However, it has proven\nchallenging to infer the interaction rules directly from data. In the field of\nequation discovery, the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics\n(WSINDy) methodology has been shown to be very computationally efficient for\nidentifying the governing equations of complex systems, even in the presence of\nsubstantial noise. Motivated by the success of IPS models to describe the\nspatial movement of organisms, we develop WSINDy for second order IPSs to model\nthe movement of communities of cells. Specifically, our approach learns the\ndirectional interaction rules that govern the dynamics of a heterogeneous\npopulation of migrating cells. Rather than aggregating cellular trajectory data\ninto a single best-fit model, we learn the models for each individual cell.\nThese models can then be efficiently classified according to the active classes\nof interactions present in the model. From these classifications, aggregated\nmodels are constructed hierarchically to simultaneously identify different\nspecies of cells present in the population and determine best-fit models for\neach species. We demonstrate the efficiency and proficiency of the method on\nseveral test scenarios, motivated by common cell migration experiments.",

    "title": "Efficient solution of robust optimal control problems using local  reduction",
    "abstract": "Robust optimal control enables ensuring correct operation of a system subject\nto uncertainty. Existing methods for nonlinear robust control often use\nscenario-based approaches to formulate the control problem as nonlinear\noptimisation problems. Solving the resulting optimisation problems is a\nchallenge due to the size of the problem. Mitigating the size of the problem by\nreducing the number of scenarios requires knowledge about how the uncertainty\naffects the system. This paper draws from local reduction methods used in\nsemi-infinite optimisation to propose a new method to solve robust optimal\ncontrol problems without a priori knowledge of the system or the uncertainty.\nBy iteratively adding interim worst-case scenarios to the problem, we ensure\nrobustness as well as provide control over the total number of scenarios. The\nmethod is validated in two case studies: temperature control in a residential\nbuilding and flow control in a centrifugal compressor. In the building case\nstudy, with 590 uncertain parameters, the usual approach based on boundary\nvalues for each parameter would give $2^{590}$ scenarios. Our method only\nneeded to include 68 scenarios in order to provide constraint satisfaction when\ntested for random realisations of uncertainties. In the compressor case study,\nthe number of scenarios was reduced from 512 to nine, facilitating the\nnumerical solution of the nonlinear optimisation problem while satisfying\nstrict safety constraints.",

    "abstract": "Aima. To determine to what extent the problem of forward fitting visibilities\nmeasured by the Spectrometer/Telescope Imaging X-rays (STIX) on-board Solar\nOrbiter is more challenging with respect to the same problem in the case of\nprevious hard X-ray solar imaging missions; to identify an effective\noptimization scheme for parametric imaging for STIX. Methods. This paper\nintroduces a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for forward fitting\nSTIX visibilities and compares its effectiveness with respect to the standard\nsimplex-based optimization algorithm used so far for the analysis of\nvisibilities measured by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic\nImager (RHESSI). This comparison is made by considering experimental\nvisibilities measured by both RHESSI and STIX, and synthetic visibilities\ngenerated by accounting for the STIX signal formation model. Results. We found\nout that the parametric imaging approach based on PSO is as reliable as the one\nbased on the simplex method in the case of RHESSI visibilities. However, PSO is\nsignificantly more robust when applied to STIX simulated and experimental\nvisibilities. Conclusions. Standard deterministic optimization is not effective\nenough for forward-fitting the few visibilities sampled by STIX in the angular\nfrequency plane. Therefore a more sofisticated optimization scheme must be\nintroduced for parametric imaging in the case of the Solar Orbiter X-ray\ntelescope. The forward-fitting routine based on PSO we introduced in this paper\nproved to be significantly robust and reliable, and could be considered as an\neffective candidate tool for parametric imaging in the STIX context.",

    "abstract": "For patients suffering from brain tumor, prognosis estimation and treatment\ndecisions are made by a multidisciplinary team based on a set of preoperative\nMR scans. Currently, the lack of standardized and automatic methods for tumor\ndetection and generation of clinical reports represents a major hurdle. In this\nstudy, we investigate glioblastomas, lower grade gliomas, meningiomas, and\nmetastases, through four cohorts of up to 4000 patients. Tumor segmentation\nmodels were trained using the AGU-Net architecture with different preprocessing\nsteps and protocols. Segmentation performances were assessed in-depth using a\nwide-range of voxel and patient-wise metrics covering volume, distance, and\nprobabilistic aspects. Finally, two software solutions have been developed,\nenabling an easy use of the trained models and standardized generation of\nclinical reports: Raidionics and Raidionics-Slicer. Segmentation performances\nwere quite homogeneous across the four different brain tumor types, with an\naverage true positive Dice ranging between 80% and 90%, patient-wise recall\nbetween 88% and 98%, and patient-wise precision around 95%. With our Raidionics\nsoftware, running on a desktop computer with CPU support, tumor segmentation\ncan be performed in 16 to 54 seconds depending on the dimensions of the MRI\nvolume. For the generation of a standardized clinical report, including the\ntumor segmentation and features computation, 5 to 15 minutes are necessary. All\ntrained models have been made open-access together with the source code for\nboth software solutions and validation metrics computation. In the future, an\nautomatic classification of the brain tumor type would be necessary to replace\nmanual user input. Finally, the inclusion of post-operative segmentation in\nboth software solutions will be key for generating complete post-operative\nstandardized clinical reports.",
