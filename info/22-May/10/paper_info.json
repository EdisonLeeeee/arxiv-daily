    "abstract": "A randomized algorithm for computing a data sparse representation of a given\nrank structured matrix $A$ (a.k.a. an $\\mathcal{H}$-matrix) is presented. The\nalgorithm draws on the randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD), and\noperates under the assumption that algorithms for rapidly applying $A$ and\n$A^{*}$ to vectors are available. The algorithm analyzes the hierarchical tree\nthat defines the rank structure using graph coloring algorithms to generate a\nset of random test vectors. The matrix is then applied to the test vectors, and\nin a final step the matrix itself is reconstructed by the observed input-output\npairs. The method presented is an evolution of the \"peeling algorithm\" of L.\nLin, J. Lu, and L. Ying, \"Fast construction of hierarchical matrix\nrepresentation from matrix-vector multiplication,\" JCP, 230(10), 2011. For the\ncase of uniform trees, the new method substantially reduces the pre-factor of\nthe original peeling algorithm. More significantly, the new technique leads to\ndramatic acceleration for many non-uniform trees since it constructs sample\nvectors that are optimized for a given tree. The algorithm is particularly\neffective for kernel matrices involving a set of points restricted to a lower\ndimensional object than the ambient space, such as a boundary integral equation\ndefined on a surface in three dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Self-attention based models such as vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged\nas a very competitive architecture alternative to convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) in computer vision. Despite increasingly stronger variants with\never-higher recognition accuracies, due to the quadratic complexity of\nself-attention, existing ViTs are typically demanding in computation and model\nsize. Although several successful design choices (e.g., the convolutions and\nhierarchical multi-stage structure) of prior CNNs have been reintroduced into\nrecent ViTs, they are still not sufficient to meet the limited resource\nrequirements of mobile devices. This motivates a very recent attempt to develop\nlight ViTs based on the state-of-the-art MobileNet-v2, but still leaves a\nperformance gap behind. In this work, pushing further along this under-studied\ndirection we introduce EdgeViTs, a new family of light-weight ViTs that, for\nthe first time, enable attention-based vision models to compete with the best\nlight-weight CNNs in the tradeoff between accuracy and on-device efficiency.\nThis is realized by introducing a highly cost-effective local-global-local\n(LGL) information exchange bottleneck based on optimal integration of\nself-attention and convolutions. For device-dedicated evaluation, rather than\nrelying on inaccurate proxies like the number of FLOPs or parameters, we adopt\na practical approach of focusing directly on on-device latency and, for the\nfirst time, energy efficiency. Specifically, we show that our models are\nPareto-optimal when both accuracy-latency and accuracy-energy trade-offs are\nconsidered, achieving strict dominance over other ViTs in almost all cases and\ncompeting with the most efficient CNNs.",

    "abstract": "Representation of Euclidean objects in a digital space has been a focus of\nresearch for over 30 years. Digital line segments are particularly important as\nother digital objects depend on their definition (e.g., digital convex objects\nor digital star-shaped objects). It may be desirable for the digital line\nsegment systems to satisfy some nice properties that their Euclidean\ncounterparts also satisfy. The system is a consistent digital line segment\nsystem (CDS) if it satisfies five properties, most notably the subsegment\nproperty (the intersection of any two digital line segments should be\nconnected) and the prolongation property (any digital line segment should be\nable to be extended into a digital line). It is known that any CDS must have\n$\\Omega(\\log n)$ Hausdorff distance to their Euclidean counterparts, where $n$\nis the number of grid points on a segment. In fact this lower bound even\napplies to consistent digital rays (CDR) where for a fixed $p \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}^2$, we consider the digital segments from $p$ to $q$ for each $q \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}^2$. In this paper, we consider families of weak consistent digital\nrays (WCDR) where we maintain four of the CDR properties but exclude the\nprolongation property. In this paper, we give a WCDR construction that has\noptimal Hausdorff distance to the exact constant. That is, we give a\nconstruction whose Hausdorff distance is 1.5 under the $L_\\infty$ metric, and\nwe show that for every $\\epsilon > 0$, it is not possible to have a WCDR with\nHausdorff distance at most $1.5 - \\epsilon$.",

    "abstract": "Image blurring refers to the degradation of an image wherein the image's\noverall sharpness decreases. Image blurring is caused by several factors.\nAdditionally, during the image acquisition process, noise may get added to the\nimage. Such a noisy and blurred image can be represented as the image resulting\nfrom the convolution of the original image with the associated point spread\nfunction, along with additive noise. However, the blurred image often contains\ninadequate information to uniquely determine the plausible original image.\nBased on the availability of blurring information, image deblurring methods can\nbe classified as blind and non-blind. In non-blind image deblurring, some prior\ninformation is known regarding the corresponding point spread function and the\nadded noise. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of\nnon-blind image deblurring methods with respect to the identification and\nelimination of noise present in blurred images. In this study, three non-blind\nimage deblurring methods, namely Wiener deconvolution, Lucy-Richardson\ndeconvolution, and regularized deconvolution were comparatively analyzed for\nnoisy images featuring salt-and-pepper noise. Two types of blurring effects\nwere simulated, namely motion blurring and Gaussian blurring. The said three\nnon-blind deblurring methods were applied under two scenarios: direct\ndeblurring of noisy blurred images and deblurring of images after denoising\nthrough the application of the adaptive median filter. The obtained results\nwere then compared for each scenario to determine the best approach for\ndeblurring noisy images.",

As with its predecessor, EVIMO2 provides labels in the form\nof per-pixel ground truth depth and segmentation as well as camera and object\nposes. All sequences use data from physical cameras and many sequences feature\nmultiple independently moving objects. Typically, such labeled data is\nunavailable in physical event camera datasets. Thus, EVIMO2 will serve as a\nchallenging benchmark for existing algorithms and rich training set for the\ndevelopment of new algorithms. In particular, EVIMO2 is suited for supporting\nresearch in motion and object segmentation, optical flow, structure from\nmotion, and visual (inertial) odometry in both monocular or stereo\nconfigurations.\nEVIMO2 consists of 41 minutes of data from three 640$\\times$480 event\ncameras, one 2080$\\times$1552 classical color camera, inertial measurements\nfrom two six axis inertial measurement units, and millimeter accurate object\nposes from a Vicon motion capture system. The dataset's 173 sequences are\narranged into three categories. 3.75 minutes of independently moving household\nobjects, 22.55 minutes of static scenes, and 14.85 minutes of basic motions in\nshallow scenes. Some sequences were recorded in low-light conditions where\nconventional cameras fail. Depth and segmentation are provided at 60 Hz for the\nevent cameras and 30 Hz for the classical camera.

In this paper, we observe that certain DP\nmechanisms are amenable to a posteriori privacy analysis that exploits the fact\nthat some outputs leak less information about the input database than others.\nTo exploit this phenomenon, we introduce output differential privacy (ODP) and\na new composition experiment, and leverage these new constructs to obtain\nsignificant privacy budget savings and improved privacy-utility tradeoffs under\ncomposition. All of this comes at no cost in terms of privacy; we do not weaken\nthe privacy guarantee.\nTo demonstrate the applicability of our a posteriori privacy analysis\ntechniques, we analyze two well-known mechanisms: the Sparse Vector Technique\nand the Propose-Test-Release framework. We then show how our techniques can be\nused to save privacy budget in more general contexts: when a differentially\nprivate iterative mechanism terminates before its maximal number of iterations\nis reached, and when the output of a DP mechanism provides unsatisfactory\nutility. Examples of the former include iterative optimization algorithms,\nwhereas examples of the latter include training a machine learning model with a\nlarge generalization error.

Inspired by behavioral economics, we recognize that humans care about\nmore than just team efficiency -- humans also have biases and expectations for\nteam dynamics. Our hypothesis is that the way inclusive robots divide the task\n(i.e., how the robots split a larger task into subtask allocations) should be\nboth legible and fair to the human partner. In this paper we introduce a\nbilevel optimization approach that enables robot teams to identify high-level\nsubtask allocations and low-level trajectories that optimize for legibility,\nfairness, or a combination of both objectives. We then test our resulting\nalgorithm across studies where humans watch or play with robot teams. We find\nthat our approach to generating legible teams makes the human's role clear, and\nthat humans typically prefer to join and collaborate with legible teams instead\nof teams that only optimize for efficiency. Incorporating fairness alongside\nlegibility further encourages participation: when humans play with robots, we\nfind that they prefer (potentially inefficient) teams where the subtasks or\neffort are evenly divided.

    "abstract": "We introduce an integral representation of the Monge-Amp\\`ere equation, which\nleads to a new finite difference method based upon numerical quadrature. The\nresulting scheme is monotone and fits immediately into existing convergence\nproofs for the Monge-Amp\\`ere equation with either Dirichlet or optimal\ntransport boundary conditions. The use of higher-order quadrature schemes\nallows for substantial reduction in the component of the error that depends on\nthe angular resolution of the finite difference stencil. This, in turn, allows\nfor significant improvements in both stencil width and formal truncation error.\nWe present two different implementations of this method. The first exploits the\nspectral accuracy of the trapezoid rule on uniform angular discretizations to\nallow for computation on a nearest-neighbors finite difference stencil over a\nlarge range of grid refinements. The second uses higher-order quadrature to\nproduce superlinear convergence while simultaneously utilizing narrower\nstencils than other monotone methods. Computational results are presented in\ntwo dimensions for problems of various regularity.",

Research has shown that deep neural\nnets make confident mispredictions on OoD inputs. Therefore, it is critical to\nidentify OoD inputs for safe and reliable deployment of deep neural nets. Often\na threshold is applied on a similarity score to detect OoD inputs. One such\nsimilarity is angular similarity which is the dot product of latent\nrepresentation with the mean class representation. Angular similarity encodes\nuncertainty, for example, if the angular similarity is less, it is less certain\nthat the input belongs to that class. However, we observe that, different\nclasses have different distributions of angular similarity. Therefore, applying\na single threshold for all classes is not ideal since the same similarity score\nrepresents different uncertainties for different classes. In this paper, we\npropose norm-scaling which normalizes the logits separately for each class.\nThis ensures that a single value consistently represents similar uncertainty\nfor various classes. We show that norm-scaling, when used with maximum softmax\nprobability detector, achieves 9.78% improvement in AUROC, 5.99% improvement in\nAUPR and 33.19% reduction in FPR95 metrics over previous state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

Existing works on the deep\nlearning (DL) model for CSI feedback have shown efficient compression and\nrecovery in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. However, practical DL\nnetworks require sizeable wireless CSI datasets during training to achieve high\nmodel accuracy. To address this labor-intensive problem, this work develops an\nefficient training enhancement solution of DL-based feedback architecture based\non a modest dataset by exploiting the complex CSI features, and augmenting CSI\ndataset based on domain knowledge.

    "abstract": "The challenges of learning a robust 6D pose function lie in 1) severe\nocclusion and 2) systematic noises in depth images. Inspired by the success of\npoint-pair features, the goal of this paper is to recover the 6D pose of an\nobject instance segmented from RGB-D images by locally matching pairs of\noriented points between the model and camera space. To this end, we propose a\nnovel Bi-directional Correspondence Mapping Network (BiCo-Net) to first\ngenerate point clouds guided by a typical pose regression, which can thus\nincorporate pose-sensitive information to optimize generation of local\ncoordinates and their normal vectors. As pose predictions via geometric\ncomputation only rely on one single pair of local oriented points, our BiCo-Net\ncan achieve robustness against sparse and occluded point clouds. An ensemble of\nredundant pose predictions from locally matching and direct pose regression\nfurther refines final pose output against noisy observations. Experimental\nresults on three popularly benchmarking datasets can verify that our method can\nachieve state-of-the-art performance, especially for the more challenging\nsevere occluded scenes.

    "abstract": "The progression of innovation and technology and ease of inter-connectivity\namong networks has allowed us to evolve towards one of the promising areas, the\nInternet of Vehicles. Nowadays, modern vehicles are connected to a range of\nnetworks, including intra-vehicle networks and external networks. However, a\nprimary challenge in the automotive industry is to make the vehicle safe and\nreliable; particularly with the loopholes in the existing traditional\nprotocols, cyber-attacks on the vehicle network are rising drastically.\nPractically every vehicle uses the universal Controller Area Network (CAN) bus\nprotocol for the communication between electronic control units to transmit key\nvehicle functionality and messages related to driver safety. The CAN bus\nsystem, although its critical significance, lacks the key feature of any\nprotocol authentication and authorization. Resulting in compromises of CAN bus\nsecurity leads to serious issues to both car and driver safety. This paper\ndiscusses the security issues of the CAN bus protocol and proposes an Intrusion\nDetection System (IDS) that detects known attacks on in-vehicle networks.\nMultiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are employed to provide\nrecognition of known potential cyber-attacks based on messages, timestamps, and\ndata packets traveling through the CAN. The main objective of this paper is to\naccurately detect cyberattacks by considering time-series features and attack\nfrequency. The majority of the evaluated AI algorithms, when considering attack\nfrequency, correctly identify known attacks with remarkable accuracy of more\nthan 99%. However, these models achieve approximately 92% to 97% accuracy when\ntimestamps are not taken into account. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Xgboost,\nand SVC have proved to the well-performing classifiers.",

    "abstract": "Wideband extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a\npromising technique to achieve Tbps data rates in future 6G systems through\nbeamforming and spatial multiplexing. Due to the extensive bandwidth and the\nhuge number of antennas for wideband XL-MIMO, a significant near-field beam\nsplit effect will be induced, where beams at different frequencies are focused\non different locations. The near-field beam split effect results in a severe\narray gain loss, so existing works mainly focus on compensating for this loss\nby utilizing the time delay (TD) beamformer. By contrast, this paper\ndemonstrates that although the near-field beam split effect degrades the array\ngain, it also provides a new possibility to realize fast near-field beam\ntraining. Specifically, we first reveal the mechanism of the near-field\ncontrollable beam split effect. This effect indicates that, by dedicatedly\ndesigning the delay parameters, a TD beamformer is able to control the degree\nof the near-field beam split effect, i.e., beams at different frequencies can\nflexibly occupy the desired location range. Due to the similarity with the\ndispersion of natural light caused by a prism, this effect is also termed as\nthe near-field rainbow in this paper. Then, taking advantage of the near-field\nrainbow effect, a fast wideband beam training scheme is proposed. In our\nscheme, the close form of the beamforming vector is elaborately derived to\nenable beams at different frequencies to be focused on different desired\nlocations. By this means, the optimal beamforming vector with the largest array\ngain can be rapidly searched out by generating multiple beams focused on\nmultiple locations simultaneously through only one radio-frequency (RF) chain.\nFinally, simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme is able to realize\nnear-optimal nearfield beam training with a very low training overhead.",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in\nmany graph-based tasks such as node classification and graph classification.\nHowever, many recent works have demonstrated that an attacker can mislead GNN\nmodels by slightly perturbing the graph structure. Existing attacks to GNNs are\neither under the less practical threat model where the attacker is assumed to\naccess the GNN model parameters, or under the practical black-box threat model\nbut consider perturbing node features that are shown to be not enough\neffective. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap and consider black-box\nattacks to GNNs with structure perturbation as well as with theoretical\nguarantees. We propose to address this challenge through bandit techniques.\nSpecifically, we formulate our attack as an online optimization with bandit\nfeedback. This original problem is essentially NP-hard due to the fact that\nperturbing the graph structure is a binary optimization problem. We then\npropose an online attack based on bandit optimization which is proven to be\n{sublinear} to the query number $T$, i.e., $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N}T^{3/4})$ where\n$N$ is the number of nodes in the graph. Finally, we evaluate our proposed\nattack by conducting experiments over multiple datasets and GNN models. The\nexperimental results on various citation graphs and image graphs show that our\nattack is both effective and efficient.

    "abstract": "Early detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia\ncoli (E. coli) is an essential task for public health. The conventional\nculture-based methods for bacterial colony detection usually take >24 hours to\nget the final read-out. Here, we demonstrate a bacterial colony-forming-unit\n(CFU) detection system exploiting a thin-film-transistor (TFT)-based image\nsensor array that saves ~12 hours compared to the Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA)-approved methods. To demonstrate the efficacy of this CFU\ndetection system, a lensfree imaging modality was built using the TFT image\nsensor with a sample field-of-view of ~10 cm^2. Time-lapse images of bacterial\ncolonies cultured on chromogenic agar plates were automatically collected at\n5-minute intervals. Two deep neural networks were used to detect and count the\ngrowing colonies and identify their species. When blindly tested with 265\ncolonies of E. coli and other coliform bacteria (i.e., Citrobacter and\nKlebsiella pneumoniae), our system reached an average CFU detection rate of\n97.3% at 9 hours of incubation and an average recovery rate of 91.6% at ~12\nhours. This TFT-based sensor can be applied to various microbiological\ndetection methods. Due to the large scalability, ultra-large field-of-view, and\nlow cost of the TFT-based image sensors, this platform can be integrated with\neach agar plate to be tested and disposed of after the automated CFU count. The\nimaging field-of-view of this platform can be cost-effectively increased to\n>100 cm^2 to provide a massive throughput for CFU detection using, e.g.,\nroll-to-roll manufacturing of TFTs as used in the flexible display industry.",

Based on the findings that skilled operators in such\nenvironments choose predetermined control strategies (e.g., grasping and\nscattering) and their durations based on sensor values, %thereby improving the\nrobustness of their actions, we propose a novel non-parametric policy search\nalgorithm: Gaussian process self-triggered policy search (GPSTPS). GPSTPS has\ntwo types of control policies: action and duration. A gating mechanism either\nmaintains the action selected by the action policy for the duration specified\nby the duration policy or updates the action and duration by passing new\nobservations to the policy; therefore, it is categorized as self-triggered.\nGPSTPS simultaneously learns both policies by trial and error based on sparse\nGP priors and variational learning to maximize the return. To verify the\nperformance of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on\ngarbage-grasping-scattering task for a waste crane with weak observations using\na simulation and a robotic waste crane system.

    "abstract": "The dense rain accumulation in heavy rain can significantly wash out images\nand thus destroy the background details of images. Although existing deep rain\nremoval models lead to improved performance for heavy rain removal, we find\nthat most of them ignore the detail reconstruction accuracy of rain-free\nimages. In this paper, we propose a dual-stage progressive enhancement network\n(DPENet) to achieve effective deraining with structure-accurate rain-free\nimages. Two main modules are included in our framework, namely a rain streaks\nremoval network (R$^2$Net) and a detail reconstruction network (DRNet). The\nformer aims to achieve accurate rain removal, and the latter is designed to\nrecover the details of rain-free images. We introduce two main strategies\nwithin our networks to achieve trade-off between the effectiveness of deraining\nand the detail restoration of rain-free images. Firstly, a dilated dense\nresidual block (DDRB) within the rain streaks removal network is presented to\naggregate high/low level features of heavy rain. Secondly, an enhanced residual\npixel-wise attention block (ERPAB) within the detail reconstruction network is\ndesigned for context information aggregation. We also propose a comprehensive\nloss function to highlight the marginal and regional accuracy of rain-free\nimages. Extensive experiments on benchmark public datasets show both efficiency\nand effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving structure-preserving\nrain-free images for heavy rain removal.

Most of the existing domain\nadaptation methods for time-series data borrow the ideas from the existing\nmethods for non-time series data to extract the domain-invariant\nrepresentation. However, two peculiar difficulties to time-series data have not\nbeen solved. 1) It is not a trivial task to model the domain-invariant and\ncomplex dependence among different timestamps. 2) The domain-variant\ninformation is important but how to leverage them is almost underexploited.\nFortunately, the stableness of causal structures among different domains\ninspires us to explore the structures behind the time-series data.

In this\nwork, we attempt to tap this potential of state-of-the-art NLP models and\ntransfer their ability to boost performance in related tasks. Our proposed\nclassification of numbers into entities helps NLP models perform well on\nseveral tasks, including a handcrafted Fill-In-The-Blank (FITB) task and on\nquestion answering using joint embeddings, outperforming the BERT and RoBERTa\nbaseline classification.",

    "abstract": "In object detection, non-maximum suppression (NMS) methods are extensively\nadopted to remove horizontal duplicates of detected dense boxes for generating\nfinal object instances. However, due to the degraded quality of dense detection\nboxes and not explicit exploration of the context information, existing NMS\nmethods via simple intersection-over-union (IoU) metrics tend to underperform\non multi-oriented and long-size objects detection. Distinguishing with general\nNMS methods via duplicate removal, we propose a novel graph fusion network,\nnamed GFNet, for multi-oriented object detection. Our GFNet is extensible and\nadaptively fuse dense detection boxes to detect more accurate and holistic\nmulti-oriented object instances. Specifically, we first adopt a locality-aware\nclustering algorithm to group dense detection boxes into different clusters. We\nwill construct an instance sub-graph for the detection boxes belonging to one\ncluster. Then, we propose a graph-based fusion network via Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN) to learn to reason and fuse the detection boxes for generating\nfinal instance boxes. Extensive experiments both on public available\nmulti-oriented text datasets (including MSRA-TD500, ICDAR2015, ICDAR2017-MLT)\nand multi-oriented object datasets (DOTA) verify the effectiveness and\nrobustness of our method against general NMS methods in multi-oriented object\ndetection.",

The robotic scanning was developed to follow a\nspinal curvature with deep learning and apply consistent forces to the patient'\nback. Methods: 23 scoliosis patients were scanned with US devices both,\nrobotically and manually. Two human raters measured each subject's spinous\nprocess angles (SPA) on robotic and manual coronal images. Results: The robotic\nmethod showed high intra- (ICC > 0.85) and inter-rater (ICC > 0.77)\nreliabilities. Compared with the manual method, the robotic approach showed no\nsignificant difference (p < 0.05) when measuring coronal deformity angles. The\nMAD for intra-rater analysis lies within an acceptable range from 0 deg to 5\ndeg for a minimum of 86% and a maximum 97% of a total number of the measured\nangles.

    "abstract": "Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention,\nsince it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing\nraw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g.,\nmotion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the\ncoarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB\nand motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a\nnovel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion\nEnhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for\nthe RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the\nmotion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to\nenhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is\nthen strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and\nCross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality\nwith spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines\nthe two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments\non the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.",

    "abstract": "The widespread image applications have greatly promoted the vision-based\ntasks, in which the Image Quality Assessment (IQA) technique has become an\nincreasingly significant issue. For user enjoyment in multimedia systems, the\nIQA exploits image fidelity and aesthetics to characterize user experience;\nwhile for other tasks such as popular object recognition, there exists a low\ncorrelation between utilities and perceptions. In such cases, the\nfidelity-based and aesthetics-based IQA methods cannot be directly applied. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a utility-oriented IQA in object\nrecognition. In particular, we initialize our research in the scenario of\nunderwater fish detection, which is a critical task that has not yet been\nperfectly addressed. Based on this task, we build an Underwater Image Utility\nDatabase (UIUD) and a learning-based Underwater Image Utility Measure (UIUM).\nInspired by the top-down design of fidelity-based IQA, we exploit the deep\nmodels of object recognition and transfer their features to our UIUM.\nExperiments validate that the proposed transfer-learning-based UIUM achieves\npromising performance in the recognition task.

Dominant approaches to\ndisentangle a sensitive attribute from textual representations rely on learning\nsimultaneously a penalization term that involves either an adversarial loss\n(e.g., a discriminator) or an information measure (e.g., mutual information).\nHowever, these methods require the training of a deep neural network with\nseveral parameter updates for each update of the representation model. As a\nmatter of fact, the resulting nested optimization loop is both time consuming,\nadding complexity to the optimization dynamic, and requires a fine\nhyperparameter selection (e.g., learning rates, architecture). In this work, we\nintroduce a family of regularizers for learning disentangled representations\nthat do not require training. These regularizers are based on statistical\nmeasures of similarity between the conditional probability distributions with\nrespect to the sensitive attributes.

    "abstract": "With the advent of multi-core systems, GPUs and FPGAs, loop parallelization\nhas become a promising way to speed-up program execution. In order to stay up\nwith time, various performance-oriented programming languages provide a\nmultitude of constructs to allow programmers to write parallelizable loops.\nCorrespondingly, researchers have developed techniques to automatically\nparallelize loops that do not carry dependences across iterations, and/or call\npure functions. However, in managed languages with platform-independent\nruntimes such as Java, it is practically infeasible to perform complex\ndependence analysis during JIT compilation. In this paper, we propose\nAutoTornado, a first of its kind static+JIT loop parallelizer for Java programs\nthat parallelizes loops for heterogeneous architectures using TornadoVM (a\nGraal-based VM that supports insertion of @Parallel constructs for loop\nparallelization).\nAutoTornado performs sophisticated dependence and purity analysis of Java\nprograms statically, in the Soot framework, to generate constraints encoding\nconditions under which a given loop can be parallelized. The generated\nconstraints are then fed to the Z3 theorem prover (which we have integrated\nwith Soot) to annotate canonical for loops that can be parallelized using the\n@Parallel construct. We have also added runtime support in TornadoVM to use\nstatic analysis results for loop parallelization. Our evaluation over several\nstandard parallelization kernels shows that AutoTornado correctly parallelizes\n61.3% of manually parallelizable loops, with an efficient static analysis and a\nnear-zero runtime overhead. To the best of our knowledge, AutoTornado is not\nonly the first tool that performs program-analysis based parallelization for a\nreal-world JVM, but also the first to integrate Z3 with Soot for loop\nparallelization.",

A heuristic descent\nsearch method is applied to search the optimal velocity at which the propeller\nand the elevator are engaged. A significant improvement of power required at\nmedium and high speed with acceptable rotor airloads increment was found by\nusing the Hybrid Trim strategy in the speed range of 0-100m/s, with regard to a\npre-configured pitch angle schedule. The corresponding control variables\nobtained locate in a reasonable control range, with a maximum power reduced of\n13% at 100m/s, which showcases the potential of the Hybrid Trim strategy.",

    "title": "Double-Side Near-Field Channel Estimation for Extremely Large-Scale MIMO  System",
    "abstract": "Accurate channel estimation is essential to empower extremely large-scale\nMIMO (XL-MIMO) in 6G networks with ultra-high spectral efficiency.\nUnfortunately, most of the existing channel estimation methods designed for\nXL-MIMO fail to consider a double-side near-field scenario, where both\ntransmitter and receiver are equipped with extremely large-scale antenna\narrays. The existing channel estimation schemes cannot be directly applied to\nthe double-side near-field scenario. In this paper, based on this scenario, we\nfirst derive double-side near-field Rayleigh distance (DS-RD) and effective\ndouble-side near-field Rayleigh distance (EDS-RD) to determine the range of the\ndouble-side near-field region. Then, a double-side near-field channel model is\nproposed to match this scenario, where the distance of the transmitter from the\nreceiver is smaller than EDS-RD. In the proposed channel model, the line of\nsight (LoS) path component is modeled by the geometric free assumption while\nnon-line of sight (NLoS) path components are modeled by the near-field array\nresponse vectors. Finally, a double-side near-field channel estimation\nalgorithm is proposed to solve the channel estimation problem in this scenario,\nwhere the LoS path component and NLoS path components are estimated separately.\nNumerical simulation results demonstrate that, the proposed channel estimation\nalgorithm is able to outperform the existing methods.",

    "title": "Near-optimal Algorithms for Stochastic Online Bin Packing",
    "abstract": "We study the online bin packing problem under two stochastic settings. In the\nbin packing problem, we are given n items with sizes in (0,1] and the goal is\nto pack them into the minimum number of unit-sized bins. First, we study bin\npacking under the i.i.d. model, where item sizes are sampled independently and\nidentically from a distribution in (0,1]. Both the distribution and the total\nnumber of items are unknown. The items arrive one by one and their sizes are\nrevealed upon their arrival and they must be packed immediately and irrevocably\nin bins of size 1. We provide a simple meta-algorithm that takes an offline\n$\\alpha$-asymptotic approximation algorithm and provides a polynomial-time\n$(\\alpha + \\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm for online bin packing under the\ni.i.d. model, where $\\varepsilon$>0 is a small constant. Using the AFPTAS for\noffline bin packing, we thus provide a linear time\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm for online bin packing under i.i.d.\nmodel, thus settling the problem.\nWe then study the random-order model, where an adversary specifies the items,\nbut the order of arrival of items is drawn uniformly at random from the set of\nall permutations of the items. Kenyon's seminal result [SODA'96] showed that\nthe Best-Fit algorithm has a competitive ratio of at most 3/2 in the\nrandom-order model, and conjectured the ratio to be around 1.15. However, it\nhas been a long-standing open problem to break the barrier of 3/2 even for\nspecial cases. Recently, Albers et al. [Algorithmica'21] showed an improvement\nto 5/4 competitive ratio in the special case when all the item sizes are\ngreater than 1/3. For this special case, we settle the analysis by showing that\nBest-Fit has a competitive ratio of 1. We make further progress by breaking the\nbarrier of 3/2 for the 3-Partition problem, a notoriously hard special case of\nbin packing, where all item sizes lie in (1/4,1/2].",

    "abstract": "Recently, correlation filter has been widely applied in unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) tracking due to its high frame rates, robustness and low\ncalculation resources. However, it is fragile because of two inherent defects,\ni.e, boundary effect and filter corruption. Some methods by enlarging the\nsearch area can mitigate the boundary effect, yet introducing the undesired\nbackground distractors. Another approaches can alleviate the temporal\ndegeneration of learned filters by introducing the temporal regularizer, which\ndepends on the assumption that the filers between consecutive frames should be\ncoherent. In fact, sometimes the filers at the ($t-1$)th frame is vulnerable to\nheavy occlusion from backgrounds, which causes that the assumption does not\nhold. To handle them, in this work, we propose a novel $\\ell_{1}$\nregularization correlation filter with adaptive contextual learning and\nkeyfilter selection for UAV tracking. Firstly, we adaptively detect the\npositions of effective contextual distractors by the aid of the distribution of\nlocal maximum values on the response map of current frame which is generated by\nusing the previous correlation filter model. Next, we eliminate inconsistent\nlabels for the tracked target by removing one on each distractor and develop a\nnew score scheme for each distractor. Then, we can select the keyfilter from\nthe filters pool by finding the maximal similarity between the target at the\ncurrent frame and the target template corresponding to each filter in the\nfilters pool. Finally, quantitative and qualitative experiments on three\nauthoritative UAV datasets show that the proposed method is superior to the\nstate-of-the-art tracking methods based on correlation filter framework.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has recently achieved remarkable performance in image\nclassification tasks, which depends heavily on massive annotation. However, the\nclassification mechanism of existing deep learning models seems to contrast to\nhumans' recognition mechanism. With only a glance at an image of the object\neven unknown type, humans can quickly and precisely find other same category\nobjects from massive images, which benefits from daily recognition of various\nobjects. In this paper, we attempt to build a generalizable framework that\nemulates the humans' recognition mechanism in the image classification task,\nhoping to improve the classification performance on unseen categories with the\nsupport of annotations of other categories. Specifically, we investigate a new\ntask termed Comparison Knowledge Translation (CKT). Given a set of fully\nlabeled categories, CKT aims to translate the comparison knowledge learned from\nthe labeled categories to a set of novel categories. To this end, we put\nforward a Comparison Classification Translation Network (CCT-Net), which\ncomprises a comparison classifier and a matching discriminator. The comparison\nclassifier is devised to classify whether two images belong to the same\ncategory or not, while the matching discriminator works together in an\nadversarial manner to ensure whether classified results match the truth.\nExhaustive experiments show that CCT-Net achieves surprising generalization\nability on unseen categories and SOTA performance on target categories.",

To this end, we discuss modifications of the\nunderlying expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which is needed to fit the\nparameters of the GMM, to allow for structurally constrained covariances.\nFurther, we investigate splitting the 2D time and frequency estimation problem\nin wideband systems into cascaded 1D estimations with the help of the GMM. The\nproposed cascaded GMM approach drastically reduces the complexity and memory\nrequirements. We observe that due to the training on realistic channel data,\nthe proposed GMM estimators seem to inherently perform a trade-off between\nsaving complexity/parameters and estimation performance. We compare these\nlow-complexity approaches to a practical and low cost method that relies on the\npower delay profile (PDP) and the Doppler spectrum (DS).

Although manual picking can produce accurate normal\nmoveout (NMO) velocities from the velocity spectra of prestack gathers, it is\ntime-consuming and becomes infeasible with the emergence of large amount of\nseismic data. Numerous automatic velocity picking methods have thus been\ndeveloped. In recent years, deep learning (DL) methods have produced good\nresults on the seismic data with medium and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).\nUnfortunately, it still lacks a picking method to automatically generate\naccurate velocities in the situations of low SNR.

In\nparticular, we transform the velocity picking problem into a semantic\nsegmentation problem based on the velocity spectrum images.

Surprisingly,\nall existing multilingual code-switching methods disregard the inherent\nsemantic structure in SLU, i.e., most utterances contain one or more slots, and\neach slot consists of one or more words. In this paper, we propose to exploit\nthe \"utterance-slot-word\" structure of SLU and systematically model this\nstructure by a multi-level contrastive learning framework at the utterance,\nslot, and word levels. We develop novel code-switching schemes to generate hard\nnegative examples for contrastive learning at all levels. Furthermore, we\ndevelop a label-aware joint model to leverage label semantics for cross-lingual\nknowledge transfer. Our experimental results show that our proposed methods\nsignificantly improve the performance compared with the strong baselines on two\nzero-shot cross-lingual SLU benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are used to model dynamical\nprocesses in a large number of scientific fields, ranging from finance to\nbiology. In many applications standard local models are not sufficient to\naccurately account for certain non-local phenomena such as, e.g., interactions\nat a distance. In order to properly capture these phenomena non-local nonlinear\nPDE models are frequently employed in the literature. In this article we\npropose two numerical methods based on machine learning and on Picard\niterations, respectively, to approximately solve non-local nonlinear PDEs. The\nproposed machine learning-based method is an extended variant of a deep\nlearning-based splitting-up type approximation method previously introduced in\nthe literature and utilizes neural networks to provide approximate solutions on\na subset of the spatial domain of the solution. The Picard iterations-based\nmethod is an extended variant of the so-called full history recursive\nmultilevel Picard approximation scheme previously introduced in the literature\nand provides an approximate solution for a single point of the domain. Both\nmethods are mesh-free and allow non-local nonlinear PDEs with Neumann boundary\nconditions to be solved in high dimensions. In the two methods, the numerical\ndifficulties arising due to the dimensionality of the PDEs are avoided by (i)\nusing the correspondence between the expected trajectory of reflected\nstochastic processes and the solution of PDEs (given by the Feynman-Kac\nformula) and by (ii) using a plain vanilla Monte Carlo integration to handle\nthe non-local term. We evaluate the performance of the two methods on five\ndifferent PDEs arising in physics and biology. In all cases, the methods yield\ngood results in up to 10 dimensions with short run times.

    "abstract": "When applied to a real-world safety critical system like the power grid,\ngeneral machine learning methods suffer from expensive training, non-physical\nsolutions, and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, many\nrecent works have explored the inclusion of grid physics (i.e., domain\nexpertise) into their method design, primarily through inclusion of system\nconstraints and technical limits, reducing search space and crafting latent\nspace. Yet, there is no general framework to evaluate the practicality of these\napproaches in power grid tasks, and limitations exist regarding scalability,\ngeneralization, interpretability, etc. This work formalizes a new concept of\nphysical interpretability which assesses 'how does a ML model make predictions\nin a physically meaningful way?' and introduces a pyramid evaluation framework\nthat identifies a set of dimensions that a practical method should satisfy.\nInspired by the framework, the paper further develops GridWarm, a novel\ncontingency analysis warm starter for MadIoT cyberattack, based on a\nconditional Gaussian random field. This method serves as an instance of an ML\nmodel that can incorporate diverse domain knowledge and improve on different\ndimensions that the framework has identified.

Current\napproaches to this task mainly focus on improving the response generation model\nby recognizing the emotion of the user or predicting a target emotion to guide\nthe generation of responses. Such models only exploit partial information (the\nuser's emotion or the target emotion used as a guiding signal) and do not\nconsider multiple information together. In addition to the emotional style of\nthe response, the intent of the response is also very important for empathetic\nresponding. Thus, we propose a novel empathetic response generation model that\ncan consider multiple state information including emotions and intents\nsimultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a state management method to\ndynamically update the dialogue states, in which the user's emotion is first\nrecognized, then the target emotion and intent are obtained via predefined\nshift patterns with the user's emotion as input. The obtained information is\nused to control the response generation.

Some recent works show that, in\nlow-light conditions, object detectors using raw image data are more robust\nthan detectors using image data processed by a traditional ISP pipeline. To\nimprove detection performance in low-light conditions, one can fine-tune the\ndetector to use raw image data or use a dedicated low-light neural pipeline\ntrained with paired low- and normal-light data to restore and enhance the\nimage. However, different camera sensors have different spectral sensitivity\nand learning-based models using raw images process data in the sensor-specific\ncolor space. Thus, once trained, they do not guarantee generalization to other\ncamera sensors. We propose to improve generalization to unseen camera sensors\nby implementing a minimal neural ISP pipeline for machine cognition, named\nGenISP, that explicitly incorporates Color Space Transformation to a\ndevice-independent color space. We also propose a two-stage color processing\nimplemented by two image-to-parameter modules that take down-sized image as\ninput and regress global color correction parameters. Moreover, we propose to\ntrain our proposed GenISP under the guidance of a pre-trained object detector\nand avoid making assumptions about perceptual quality of the image, but rather\noptimize the image representation for machine cognition. At the inference\nstage, GenISP can be paired with any object detector. We perform extensive\nexperiments to compare our method to other low-light image restoration and\nenhancement methods in an extrinsic task-based evaluation and validate that\nGenISP can generalize to unseen sensors and object detectors. Finally, we\ncontribute a low-light dataset of 7K raw images annotated with 46K bounding\nboxes for task-based benchmarking of future low-light image restoration and\nobject detection.",

While it is possible to\ncheck for collisions at a point using standard algorithms, to date no practical\nmethod exists for computing collision-free C-space regions with rigorous\ncertificates due to the complexities of mapping task-space obstacles through\nthe kinematics. In this work, we present the first to our knowledge method for\ngenerating such regions and certificates through convex optimization. Our\nmethod, called C-Iris (C-space Iterative Regional Inflation by Semidefinite\nprogramming), generates large, convex polytopes in a rational parametrization\nof the configuration space which are guaranteed to be collision-free. Such\nregions have been shown to be useful for both optimization-based and randomized\nmotion planning. Our regions are generated by alternating between two convex\noptimization problems: (1) a simultaneous search for a maximal-volume ellipse\ninscribed in a given polytope and a certificate that the polytope is\ncollision-free and (2) a maximal expansion of the polytope away from the\nellipse which does not violate the certificate. The volume of the ellipse and\nsize of the polytope are allowed to grow over several iterations while being\ncollision-free by construction. Our method works in arbitrary dimensions, only\nmakes assumptions about the convexity of the obstacles in the task space, and\nscales to realistic problems in manipulation. We demonstrate our algorithm's\nability to fill a non-trivial amount of collision-free C-space in a 3-DOF\nexample where the C-space can be visualized, as well as the scalability of our\nalgorithm on a 7-DOF KUKA iiwa and a 12-DOF bimanual manipulator.",

AKI-BERT is a\nBERT model pre-trained on the clinical notes of patients having risks for AKI.\nOur experiments on Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III)\ndataset demonstrate that AKI-BERT can yield performance improvements for early\nAKI prediction, thus expanding the utility of the BERT model from general\nclinical domain to disease-specific domain.",

    "abstract": "Two-sided online matching platforms have been employed in various markets.\nHowever, agents' preferences in present market are usually implicit and unknown\nand must be learned from data. With the growing availability of side\ninformation involved in the decision process, modern online matching\nmethodology demands the capability to track preference dynamics for agents\nbased on their contextual information. This motivates us to consider a novel\nContextual Online Matching Bandit prOblem (COMBO), which allows dynamic\npreferences in matching decisions. Existing works focus on multi-armed bandit\nwith static preference, but this is insufficient: the two-sided preference\nchanges as along as one-side's contextual information updates, resulting in\nnon-static matching. In this paper, we propose a Centralized Contextual -\nExplore Then Commit (CC-ETC) algorithm to adapt to the COMBO. CC-ETC solves\nonline matching with dynamic preference. In theory, we show that CC-ETC\nachieves a sublinear regret upper bound O(log(T)) and is a rate-optimal\nalgorithm by proving a matching lower bound. In the experiments, we demonstrate\nthat CC-ETC is robust to variant preference schemes, dimensions of contexts,\nreward noise levels, and contexts variation levels.",

    "abstract": "Keratoconus is a severe eye disease that leads to deformation of the cornea.\nIt impacts people aged 10-25 years and is the leading cause of blindness in\nthat demography. Corneal topography is the gold standard for keratoconus\ndiagnosis. It is a non-invasive process performed using expensive and bulky\nmedical devices called corneal topographers. This makes it inaccessible to\nlarge populations, especially in the Global South. Low-cost smartphone-based\ncorneal topographers, such as SmartKC, have been proposed to make keratoconus\ndiagnosis accessible. Similar to medical-grade topographers, SmartKC outputs\ncurvature heatmaps and quantitative metrics that need to be evaluated by\ndoctors for keratoconus diagnosis. An automatic scheme for evaluation of these\nheatmaps and quantitative values can play a crucial role in screening\nkeratoconus in areas where doctors are not available. In this work, we propose\na dual-head convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying keratoconus on\nthe heatmaps generated by SmartKC. Since SmartKC is a new device and only had a\nsmall dataset (114 samples), we developed a 2-stage transfer learning strategy\n-- using historical data collected from a medical-grade topographer and a\nsubset of SmartKC data -- to satisfactorily train our network.

To exploit the potential gains\nthat the mobility of RABS can bring in the system, the minimum rate among all\nusers is maximized by jointly optimizing the RABS deployment, user association\nand subcarrier allocation.

    "abstract": "Shaping codes are used to generate code sequences in which the symbols obey a\nprescribed probability distribution. They arise naturally in the context of\nsource coding for noiseless channels with unequal symbol costs. Recently,\nshaping codes have been proposed to extend the lifetime of flash memory and\nreduce DNA synthesis time. In this paper, we study a general class of shaping\ncodes for noiseless finite-state channels with cost and i.i.d. sources. We\nestablish a relationship between the code rate and minimum average symbol cost.\nWe then determine the rate that minimizes the average cost per source symbol\n(total cost). An equivalence is established between codes minimizing average\nsymbol cost and codes minimizing total cost, and a separation theorem is\nproved, showing that optimal shaping can be achieved by a concatenation of\noptimal compression and optimal shaping for a uniform i.i.d. source.",

    "abstract": "Controlling the environmental parameters, including light in greenhouses,\nincreases the crop yield; however, the electricity cost of supplemental\nlighting can be high. Therefore, the importance of applying cost-effective\nlighting methods arises. In this paper, an optimal supplemental lighting\ncontrol approach is developed considering a variational inference Bayesian\nNeural Network (BNN) model for sunlight prediction. The predictive model is\nvalidated through testing the model on the historical solar data of a site\nlocated at North Carolina ($R^{2}$=0.9971, RMSE=1.8%). The proposed lighting\napproach is shown to minimize electricity cost by considering the BNN-based\nsunlight prediction, plant light needs, and variable electricity pricing when\nsolving the underlying optimization problem. For evaluation, the new strategy\nis compared to: 1) a Markov-based prediction method, which solves the same\noptimization problem, assuming a Markov model for sunlight prediction; 2) a\nheuristic method which aims to supply a fixed amount of light. Simulation\nstudies are conducted to examine the electricity cost improvements of the\nBNN-based approach. The results show that the BNN-based approach reduces cost\nby (on average) 2.27% and 43.91% compared to the Markov prediction-based method\nand the heuristic method, respectively, throughout a year.",

This leads\nto the accurate extraction of functionally-graded continuous fibers.

    "abstract": "Low-rank tensor factorization or completion is well-studied and applied in\nvarious online settings, such as online tensor factorization (where the\ntemporal mode grows) and online tensor completion (where incomplete slices\narrive gradually). However, in many real-world settings, tensors may have more\ncomplex evolving patterns: (i) one or more modes can grow; (ii) missing entries\nmay be filled; (iii) existing tensor elements can change. Existing methods\ncannot support such complex scenarios. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a\nGeneralized Online Canonical Polyadic (CP) Tensor factorization and completion\nframework (named GOCPT) for this general setting, where we maintain the CP\nstructure of such dynamic tensors during the evolution. We show that existing\nonline tensor factorization and completion setups can be unified under the\nGOCPT framework. Furthermore, we propose a variant, named GOCPTE, to deal with\ncases where historical tensor elements are unavailable (e.g., privacy\nprotection), which achieves similar fitness as GOCPT but with much less\ncomputational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our GOCPT can improve\nfitness by up to 2:8% on the JHU Covid data and 9:2% on a proprietary patient\nclaim dataset over baselines.

    "abstract": "A number of engineering and scientific problems require representing and\nmanipulating probability distributions over large alphabets, which we may think\nof as long vectors of reals summing to $1$. In some cases it is required to\nrepresent such a vector with only $b$ bits per entry. A natural choice is to\npartition the interval $[0,1]$ into $2^b$ uniform bins and quantize entries to\neach bin independently. We show that a minor modification of this procedure --\napplying an entrywise non-linear function (compander) $f(x)$ prior to\nquantization -- yields an extremely effective quantization method. For example,\nfor $b=8 (16)$ and $10^5$-sized alphabets, the quality of representation\nimproves from a loss (under KL divergence) of $0.1 (0.5)$ bits/entry to\n$10^{-4} (10^{-9})$ bits/entry. Compared to floating point representations, our\ncompander method improves the loss from $10^{-1}(10^{-6})$ to\n$10^{-4}(10^{-9})$ bits/entry. These numbers hold for both real-world data\n(word frequencies in books and DNA $k$-mer counts) and for synthetic randomly\ngenerated distributions. Theoretically, we set up a minimax optimality\ncriterion and show that the compander $f(x) ~\\propto~\n\\mathrm{ArcSinh}(\\sqrt{(1/2) (K \\log K) x})$ achieves near-optimal performance,\nattaining a KL-quantization loss of $\\asymp 2^{-2b} \\log^2 K$ for a $K$-letter\nalphabet and $b\\to \\infty$. Interestingly, a similar minimax criterion for the\nquadratic loss on the hypercube shows optimality of the standard uniform\nquantizer. This suggests that the $\\mathrm{ArcSinh}$ quantizer is as\nfundamental for KL-distortion as the uniform quantizer for quadratic\ndistortion.",

The\nmain bottleneck of the GP method lies in the inversion of a covariance matrix,\nwhose cost grows cubically with respect to the size of samples. To improve the\nscalability of the GP method while retaining desirable accuracy, we draw\ninspiration from SGP approximations, where inducing points are introduced to\nsummarize the information of samples. More precisely, our SGP method uses a\nGaussian prior associated with a low-rank kernel generated by inducing points\nrandomly selected from samples. In the SGP method, the size of the matrix to be\ninverted is proportional to the number of inducing points, which is much less\nthan the size of the samples. The numerical experiments show that the SGP\nmethod using less than half of the uniform samples as inducing points achieves\ncomparable accuracy to the GP method using the same number of uniform samples,\nwhich significantly reduces the computational cost. We give the existence proof\nfor the approximation to the solution of a PDE and provide rigorous error\nanalysis.",

    "abstract": "Space-time memory (STM) based video object segmentation (VOS) networks\nusually keep increasing memory bank every several frames, which shows excellent\nperformance. However, 1) the hardware cannot withstand the ever-increasing\nmemory requirements as the video length increases. 2) Storing lots of\ninformation inevitably introduces lots of noise, which is not conducive to\nreading the most important information from the memory bank. In this paper, we\npropose a Recurrent Dynamic Embedding (RDE) to build a memory bank of constant\nsize. Specifically, we explicitly generate and update RDE by the proposed\nSpatio-temporal Aggregation Module (SAM), which exploits the cue of historical\ninformation. To avoid error accumulation owing to the recurrent usage of SAM,\nwe propose an unbiased guidance loss during the training stage, which makes SAM\nmore robust in long videos. Moreover, the predicted masks in the memory bank\nare inaccurate due to the inaccurate network inference, which affects the\nsegmentation of the query frame. To address this problem, we design a novel\nself-correction strategy so that the network can repair the embeddings of masks\nwith different qualities in the memory bank. Extensive experiments show our\nmethod achieves the best tradeoff between performance and speed. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/Limingxing00/RDE-VOS-CVPR2022.",

We set up an open source evaluation framework and\nleaderboards for both standardized and specialized hardware. The competition\ninvolves three tracks. The standard hardware track T1 evaluates algorithms on\nan Azure VM with limited DRAM, often the bottleneck in serving billion-scale\nindices, where the embedding data can be hundreds of GigaBytes in size. It uses\nFAISS~\\citep{Faiss17} as the baseline.

Since news in different domains has different features, researchers\nhave be-gun to use single domain label for fake news detection recently. This\nemerg-ing field is called multi-domain fake news detection (MFND). Existing\nworks show that using single domain label can improve the accuracy of fake news\ndetection model. However, there are two problems in previous works. Firstly,\nthey ignore that a piece of news may have features from different domains. The\nsingle domain label focuses only on the features of the news on particu-lar\ndomain. This may reduce the performance of the model. Secondly, their model\ncannot transfer the domain knowledge to the other dataset without domain label.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel model, FuDFEND, which solves the limitations\nabove by introducing the fuzzy inference mechanism. Specifically, FuDFEND\nutilizes a neural network to fit the fuzzy inference process which constructs a\nfuzzy domain label for each news item. Then, the feature extraction module uses\nthe fuzzy domain label to extract the multi-domain features of the news and\nobtain the total feature representation. Fi-nally, the discriminator module\nuses the total feature representation to dis-criminate whether the news item is\nfake news.

Several genetic mutations and\npredisposing factors that contribute to TAA have been studied in mouse models\nto characterize specific changes in aortic microstructure and material\nproperties that result from a wide range of mechanobiological insults.\nAssessments of TAA progression in vivo is largely limited to measurements of\naneurysm size and growth rate. It has been shown that aortic geometry alone is\nnot sufficient to predict the patient-specific progression of TAA but\ncomputational modeling of the evolving biomechanics of the aorta could predict\nfuture geometry and properties from initiating insults. In this work, we\npresent an integrated framework to train a deep operator network\n(DeepONet)-based surrogate model to identify contributing factors for TAA by\nusing FE-based datasets of aortic growth and remodeling resulting from\nprescribed insults. For training data, we investigate multiple types of TAA\nrisk factors and spatial distributions within a constrained mixture model to\ngenerate axial--azimuthal maps of aortic dilatation and distensibility. The\ntrained network is then capable of predicting the initial distribution and\nextent of the insult from a given set of dilatation and distensibility\ninformation.

    "abstract": "Recent cost volume pyramid based deep neural networks have unlocked the\npotential of efficiently leveraging high-resolution images for depth inference\nfrom multi-view stereo. In general, those approaches assume that the depth of\neach pixel follows a unimodal distribution. Boundary pixels usually follow a\nmulti-modal distribution as they represent different depths; Therefore, the\nassumption results in an erroneous depth prediction at the coarser level of the\ncost volume pyramid and can not be corrected in the refinement levels leading\nto wrong depth predictions. In contrast, we propose constructing the cost\nvolume by non-parametric depth distribution modeling to handle pixels with\nunimodal and multi-modal distributions. Our approach outputs multiple depth\nhypotheses at the coarser level to avoid errors in the early stage. As we\nperform local search around these multiple hypotheses in subsequent levels, our\napproach does not maintain the rigid depth spatial ordering and, therefore, we\nintroduce a sparse cost aggregation network to derive information within each\nvolume. We evaluate our approach extensively on two benchmark datasets: DTU and\nTanks & Temples. Our experimental results show that our model outperforms\nexisting methods by a large margin and achieves superior performance on\nboundary regions.

    "abstract": "Recent literature focuses on utilizing the entity information in the\nsentence-level relation extraction (RE), but this risks leaking superficial and\nspurious clues of relations. As a result, RE still suffers from unintended\nentity bias, i.e., the spurious correlation between entity mentions (names) and\nrelations. Entity bias can mislead the RE models to extract the relations that\ndo not exist in the text. To combat this issue, some previous work masks the\nentity mentions to prevent the RE models from overfitting entity mentions.\nHowever, this strategy degrades the RE performance because it loses the\nsemantic information of entities. In this paper, we propose the CORE\n(Counterfactual Analysis based Relation Extraction) debiasing method that\nguides the RE models to focus on the main effects of textual context without\nlosing the entity information. We first construct a causal graph for RE, which\nmodels the dependencies between variables in RE models. Then, we propose to\nconduct counterfactual analysis on our causal graph to distill and mitigate the\nentity bias, that captures the causal effects of specific entity mentions in\neach instance. Note that our CORE method is model-agnostic to debias existing\nRE systems during inference without changing their training processes.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate that our CORE yields significant\ngains on both effectiveness and generalization for RE.

In situations where\nthe training and testing data are drawn from different domains, a typical\napproach is to apply domain adaptation techniques to improve face PAD\nperformance with the help of target domain data. However, it has always been a\nnon-trivial challenge to collect sufficient data samples in the target domain,\nespecially for attack samples. This paper introduces a teacher-student\nframework to improve the cross-domain performance of face PAD with one-class\ndomain adaptation. In addition to the source domain data, the framework\nutilizes only a few genuine face samples of the target domain. Under this\nframework, a teacher network is trained with source domain samples to provide\ndiscriminative feature representations for face PAD. Student networks are\ntrained to mimic the teacher network and learn similar representations for\ngenuine face samples of the target domain. In the test phase, the similarity\nscore between the representations of the teacher and student networks is used\nto distinguish attacks from genuine ones. To evaluate the proposed framework\nunder one-class domain adaptation settings, we devised two new protocols and\nconducted extensive experiments.

    "abstract": "Much of the success of fingerprint recognition is attributed to\nminutiae-based fingerprint representation. It was believed that minutiae\ntemplates could not be inverted to obtain a high fidelity fingerprint image,\nbut this assumption has been shown to be false. The success of deep learning\nhas resulted in alternative fingerprint representations (embeddings), in the\nhope that they might offer better recognition accuracy as well as\nnon-invertibility of deep network-based templates. We evaluate whether deep\nfingerprint templates suffer from the same reconstruction attacks as the\nminutiae templates. We show that while a deep template can be inverted to\nproduce a fingerprint image that could be matched to its source image, deep\ntemplates are more resistant to reconstruction attacks than minutiae templates.\nIn particular, reconstructed fingerprint images from minutiae templates yield a\nTAR of about 100.0% (98.3%) @ FAR of 0.01% for type-I (type-II) attacks using a\nstate-of-the-art commercial fingerprint matcher, when tested on NIST SD4. The\ncorresponding attack performance for reconstructed fingerprint images from deep\ntemplates using the same commercial matcher yields a TAR of less than 1% for\nboth type-I and type-II attacks; however, when the reconstructed images are\nmatched using the same deep network, they achieve a TAR of 85.95% (68.10%) for\ntype-I (type-II) attacks. Furthermore, what is missing from previous\nfingerprint template inversion studies is an evaluation of the black-box attack\nperformance, which we perform using 3 different state-of-the-art fingerprint\nmatchers. We conclude that fingerprint images generated by inverting minutiae\ntemplates are highly susceptible to both white-box and black-box attack\nevaluations, while fingerprint images generated by deep templates are resistant\nto black-box evaluations and comparatively less susceptible to white-box\nevaluations.",

    "abstract": "To achieve communication-efficient federated multitask learning (FMTL), we\npropose an over-the-air FMTL (OAFMTL) framework, where multiple learning tasks\ndeployed on edge devices share a non-orthogonal fading channel under the\ncoordination of an edge server (ES). In OA-FMTL, the local updates of edge\ndevices are sparsified, compressed, and then sent over the uplink channel in a\nsuperimposed fashion. The ES employs over-the-air computation in the presence\nof intertask interference. More specifically, the model aggregations of all the\ntasks are reconstructed from the channel observations concurrently, based on a\nmodified version of the turbo compressed sensing (Turbo-CS) algorithm (named as\nM-Turbo-CS). We analyze the performance of the proposed OA-FMTL framework\ntogether with the M-Turbo-CS algorithm. Furthermore, based on the analysis, we\nformulate a communication-learning optimization problem to improve the system\nperformance by adjusting the power allocation among the tasks at the edge\ndevices. Numerical simulations show that our proposed OAFMTL effectively\nsuppresses the inter-task interference, and achieves a learning performance\ncomparable to its counterpart with orthogonal multi-task transmission. It is\nalso shown that the proposed inter-task power allocation optimization algorithm\nsubstantially reduces the overall communication overhead by appropriately\nadjusting the power allocation among the tasks.",

Recently, knowledge distillation (KD) for GNNs has\nenabled remarkable progress in graph model compression and knowledge transfer.\nHowever, most of the existing KD methods require a large volume of real data,\nwhich are not readily available in practice, and may preclude their\napplicability in scenarios where the teacher model is trained on rare or hard\nto acquire datasets. To address this problem, we propose the first end-to-end\nframework for data-free adversarial knowledge distillation on graph structured\ndata (DFAD-GNN). To be specific, our DFAD-GNN employs a generative adversarial\nnetwork, which mainly consists of three components: a pre-trained teacher model\nand a student model are regarded as two discriminators, and a generator is\nutilized for deriving training graphs to distill knowledge from the teacher\nmodel into the student model.

However, much recent evidence shows\nthat large-size pre-trained language models (PLMs) do not satisfy this\nproperty. In this paper, we perform experiments using probing tasks to assess\nPLM's LNP understanding. Unlike previous studies that only examined negation\nexpressions, we expand the boundary of the investigation to lexical semantics.\nThrough experiments, we observe that PLMs violate the LNP frequently. To\nalleviate the issue, we propose a novel intermediate training task, names\nmeaning-matching, designed to directly learn a meaning-text correspondence,\ninstead of relying on the distributional hypothesis. Through multiple\nexperiments, we find that the task enables PLMs to learn lexical semantic\ninformation. Also, through fine-tuning experiments on 7 GLUE tasks, we confirm\nthat it is a safe intermediate task that guarantees a similar or better\nperformance of downstream tasks.

However, inpainting on stereo images with\nmissing regions has not been explored thoroughly, which is also a significant\nbut different problem. One crucial requirement for stereo image inpainting is\nstereo consistency. To achieve it, we propose an Iterative Geometry-Aware Cross\nGuidance Network (IGGNet). The IGGNet contains two key ingredients, i.e., a\nGeometry-Aware Attention (GAA) module and an Iterative Cross Guidance (ICG)\nstrategy. The GAA module relies on the epipolar geometry cues and learns the\ngeometry-aware guidance from one view to another, which is beneficial to make\nthe corresponding regions in two views consistent. However, learning guidance\nfrom co-existing missing regions is challenging. To address this issue, the ICG\nstrategy is proposed, which can alternately narrow down the missing regions of\nthe two views in an iterative manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed network outperforms the latest stereo image inpainting model and\nstate-of-the-art single image inpainting models.",

This\ncontinues to be a significant area of interest with the rise of new\nstate-of-the-art methods that are based on diffusion models. However, diffusion\nmodels provide very little control over the generated image, which led to\nsubsequent works exploring techniques like classifier guidance, that provides a\nway to trade off diversity with fidelity. In this work, we explore techniques\nto condition diffusion models with carefully crafted input noise artifacts.\nThis allows generation of images conditioned on semantic attributes. This is\ndifferent from existing approaches that input Gaussian noise and further\nintroduce conditioning at the diffusion model's inference step. Our experiments\nover several examples and conditional settings show the potential of our\napproach.",

In this\nsense, a complete and fair benchmark (i.e., including large-scale pre-training\ndatasets and a variety of downstream datasets) is essential for VLP. But how to\nconstruct such a benchmark in Chinese remains a critical problem. To this end,\nwe develop a large-scale Chinese cross-modal benchmark called Zero for AI\nresearchers to fairly compare VLP models. We release two pre-training datasets\nand five fine-tuning datasets for downstream tasks. Furthermore, we propose a\nnovel pre-training framework of pre-Ranking + Ranking for cross-modal learning.\nSpecifically, we apply global contrastive pre-ranking to learn the individual\nrepresentations of images and Chinese texts, respectively. We then fuse the\nrepresentations in a fine-grained ranking manner via an image-text cross\nencoder and a text-image cross encoder. To further enhance the capability of\nthe model, we propose a two-way distillation strategy consisting of\ntarget-guided Distillation and feature-guided Distillation.

    "abstract": "Image retrieval methods for place recognition learn global image descriptors\nthat are used for fetching geo-tagged images at inference time. Recent works\nhave suggested employing weak and self-supervision for mining hard positives\nand hard negatives in order to improve localization accuracy and robustness to\nvisibility changes (e.g. in illumination or view point). However, generating\nhard positives, which is essential for obtaining robustness, is still limited\nto hard-coded or global augmentations.

Our method learns local and global augmentation policies which will\nincrease the training loss, while the image retrieval network is forced to\nlearn more powerful features for discriminating increasingly difficult\nexamples. This approach allows the image retrieval network to generalize beyond\nthe hard examples presented in the data and learn features that are robust to a\nwide range of variations.

    "abstract": "Until recently, the number of public real-world text images was insufficient\nfor training scene text recognizers. Therefore, most modern training methods\nrely on synthetic data and operate in a fully supervised manner. Nevertheless,\nthe amount of public real-world text images has increased significantly lately,\nincluding a great deal of unlabeled data. Leveraging these resources requires\nsemi-supervised approaches; however, the few existing methods do not account\nfor vision-language multimodality structure and therefore suboptimal for\nstate-of-the-art multimodal architectures. To bridge this gap, we present\nsemi-supervised learning for multimodal text recognizers (SemiMTR) that\nleverages unlabeled data at each modality training phase. Notably, our method\nrefrains from extra training stages and maintains the current three-stage\nmultimodal training procedure. Our algorithm starts by pretraining the vision\nmodel through a single-stage training that unifies self-supervised learning\nwith supervised training. More specifically, we extend an existing visual\nrepresentation learning algorithm and propose the first contrastive-based\nmethod for scene text recognition. After pretraining the language model on a\ntext corpus, we fine-tune the entire network via a sequential, character-level,\nconsistency regularization between weakly and strongly augmented views of text\nimages. In a novel setup, consistency is enforced on each modality separately.\nExtensive experiments validate that our method outperforms the current training\nschemes and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple scene text\nrecognition benchmarks.",

Since involved data usually contain sensitive information\nlike user locations, healthcare records and financial transactions, privacy\nprotection has become an increasingly pressing need in the implementation of\ndecentralized stochastic optimization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a\ndecentralized stochastic gradient descent algorithm which is embedded with\ninherent privacy protection for every participating agent against other\nparticipating agents and external eavesdroppers. This proposed algorithm builds\nin a dynamics based gradient-obfuscation mechanism to enable privacy protection\nwithout compromising optimization accuracy, which is in significant difference\nfrom differential-privacy based privacy solutions for decentralized\noptimization that have to trade optimization accuracy for privacy.

    "abstract": "Cross-modal recipe retrieval has attracted research attention in recent\nyears, thanks to the availability of large-scale paired data for training.\nNevertheless, obtaining adequate recipe-image pairs covering the majority of\ncuisines for supervised learning is difficult if not impossible. By\ntransferring knowledge learnt from a data-rich cuisine to a data-scarce\ncuisine, domain adaptation sheds light on this practical problem. Nevertheless,\nexisting works assume recipes in source and target domains are mostly\noriginated from the same cuisine and written in the same language. This paper\nstudies unsupervised domain adaptation for image-to-recipe retrieval, where\nrecipes in source and target domains are in different languages. Moreover, only\nrecipes are available for training in the target domain. A novel recipe mixup\nmethod is proposed to learn transferable embedding features between the two\ndomains. Specifically, recipe mixup produces mixed recipes to form an\nintermediate domain by discretely exchanging the section(s) between source and\ntarget recipes. To bridge the domain gap, recipe mixup loss is proposed to\nenforce the intermediate domain to locate in the shortest geodesic path between\nsource and target domains in the recipe embedding space. By using Recipe 1M\ndataset as source domain (English) and Vireo-FoodTransfer dataset as target\ndomain (Chinese), empirical experiments verify the effectiveness of recipe\nmixup for cross-lingual adaptation in the context of image-to-recipe retrieval.",

Masked auto-encoding for feature pretraining and multi-scale\nhybrid convolution-transformer architectures can further unleash the potentials\nof ViT, leading to state-of-the-art performances on image classification,\ndetection and semantic segmentation. In this paper, our ConvMAE framework\ndemonstrates that multi-scale hybrid convolution-transformer can learn more\ndiscriminative representations via the mask auto-encoding scheme.

One striking characteristic of our approach is that, conversely to\nrelated work it does not require any max-pooling or voxelization operation.\nInstead, the proposed operator used to learn the point cloud embedding in the\nencoder extracts permutation-invariant features from the point cloud via a\nsoft-pooling of feature activations, which are able to preserve fine-grained\ngeometric details. These features are then passed on to a decoder architecture.\nDue to the compression in the encoder, a typical limitation of this type of\narchitectures is that they tend to lose parts of the input shape structure. We\npropose to overcome this limitation by using skip connections specifically\ndevised for point clouds, where links between corresponding layers in the\nencoder and the decoder are established. As part of these connections, we\nintroduce a transformation matrix that projects the features from the encoder\nto the decoder and vice-versa.

Moreover, the data\nstructure is deterministic.\nMore precisely, for any integer $d_{\\star}$, the data structure preprocesses\na graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges in $\\hat{O}(md_{\\star})$ time and\nuses $\\tilde{O}(\\min\\{m,nd_{\\star}\\})$ space.

We present\na novel approach to this problem using reinforcement learning, and as\ndemonstrated on a finger-less 14-link planar model that learns to brachiate\nacross challenging handhold sequences.

Despite the\nmany recent successes of NAS, current approaches still fall far short of the\ndream of automating an entire neural network architecture design from scratch.\nMost existing approaches require highly structured design spaces formulated\nmanually by domain experts. In this work, we develop techniques that enable\nefficient NAS in a significantly larger design space. To accomplish this, we\npropose to perform NAS in an abstract search space of program properties. Our\nkey insights are as follows: (1) the abstract search space is significantly\nsmaller than the original search space, and (2) architectures with similar\nprogram properties also have similar performance; thus, we can search more\nefficiently in the abstract search space. To enable this approach, we also\npropose an efficient synthesis procedure, which accepts a set of promising\nprogram properties, and returns a satisfying neural architecture. We implement\nour approach, $\\alpha$NAS, within an evolutionary framework, where the\nmutations are guided by the program properties.

Such a property is of fundamental\nimportance for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and yet, to date, there is no\nwidely agreed-upon formal treatment of CPS resiliency. We present an STL-based\nframework for reasoning about resiliency in CPS in which resiliency has a\nsyntactic characterization in the form of an STL-based Resiliency Specification\n(SRS). Given an arbitrary STL formula $\\varphi$, time bounds $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$, the SRS of $\\varphi$, $R_{\\alpha,\\beta}(\\varphi)$, is the STL formula\n$\\neg\\varphi\\mathbf{U}_{[0,\\alpha]}\\mathbf{G}_{[0,\\beta)}\\varphi$, specifying\nthat recovery from a violation of $\\varphi$ occur within time $\\alpha$\n(recoverability), and subsequently that $\\varphi$ be maintained for duration\n$\\beta$ (durability). These $R$-expressions, which are atoms in our SRS logic,\ncan be combined using STL operators, allowing one to express composite\nresiliency specifications, e.g., multiple SRSs must hold simultaneously, or the\nsystem must eventually be resilient. We define a quantitative semantics for\nSRSs in the form of a Resilience Satisfaction Value (ReSV) function $r$ and\nprove its soundness and completeness w.r.t. STL's Boolean semantics. The\n$r$-value for $R_{\\alpha,\\beta}(\\varphi)$ atoms is a singleton set containing a\npair quantifying recoverability and durability. The $r$-value for a composite\nSRS formula results in a set of non-dominated recoverability-durability pairs,\ngiven that the ReSVs of subformulas might not be directly comparable (e.g., one\nsubformula has superior durability but worse recoverability than another). To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-dimensional quantitative\nsemantics for an STL-based logic. Two case studies demonstrate the practical\nutility of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Virtual facial avatars will play an increasingly important role in immersive\ncommunication, games and the metaverse, and it is therefore critical that they\nbe inclusive. This requires accurate recovery of the appearance, represented by\nalbedo, regardless of age, sex, or ethnicity. While significant progress has\nbeen made on estimating 3D facial geometry, albedo estimation has received less\nattention. The task is fundamentally ambiguous because the observed color is a\nfunction of albedo and lighting, both of which are unknown. We find that\ncurrent methods are biased towards light skin tones due to (1) strongly biased\npriors that prefer lighter pigmentation and (2) algorithmic solutions that\ndisregard the light/albedo ambiguity. To address this, we propose a new\nevaluation dataset (FAIR) and an algorithm (TRUST) to improve albedo estimation\nand, hence, fairness. Specifically, we create the first facial albedo\nevaluation benchmark where subjects are balanced in terms of skin color, and\nmeasure accuracy using the Individual Typology Angle (ITA) metric. We then\naddress the light/albedo ambiguity by building on a key observation: the image\nof the full scene -- as opposed to a cropped image of the face -- contains\nimportant information about lighting that can be used for disambiguation. TRUST\nregresses facial albedo by conditioning both on the face region and a global\nillumination signal obtained from the scene image. Our experimental results\nshow significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods on albedo\nestimation, both in terms of accuracy and fairness. The evaluation benchmark\nand code will be made available for research purposes at\nhttps://trust.is.tue.mpg.de.",

Video leaks participants'\non-screen information because eyeglasses and other reflective objects\nunwittingly expose partial screen contents. Using mathematical modeling and\nhuman subjects experiments, this research explores the extent to which emerging\nwebcams might leak recognizable textual information gleamed from eyeglass\nreflections captured by webcams. The primary goal of our work is to measure,\ncompute, and predict the factors, limits, and thresholds of recognizability as\nwebcam technology evolves in the future. Our work explores and characterizes\nthe viable threat models based on optical attacks using multi-frame super\nresolution techniques on sequences of video frames. Our experimental results\nand models show it is possible to reconstruct and recognize on-screen text with\na height as small as 10 mm with a 720p webcam. We further apply this threat\nmodel to web textual content with varying attacker capabilities to find\nthresholds at which text becomes recognizable. Our user study with 20\nparticipants suggests present-day 720p webcams are sufficient for adversaries\nto reconstruct textual content on big-font websites. Our models further show\nthat the evolution toward 4K cameras will tip the threshold of text leakage to\nreconstruction of most header texts on popular websites. Our research proposes\nnear-term mitigations, and justifies the importance of following the principle\nof least privilege for long-term defense against this attack.

Previous SOTA systems still\nemploy a sequence-to-sequence generation method, which merely captures the\ntable as a linear structure and is brittle when table layouts change. We seek\nto go beyond this paradigm by (1) effectively expressing the relations of\ncontent pieces in the table, and (2) making our model robust to\ncontent-invariant structural transformations. Accordingly, we propose an\nequivariance learning framework, which encodes tables with a structure-aware\nself-attention mechanism. This prunes the full self-attention structure into an\norder-invariant graph attention that captures the connected graph structure of\ncells belonging to the same row or column, and it differentiates between\nrelevant cells and irrelevant cells from the structural perspective. Our\nframework also modifies the positional encoding mechanism to preserve the\nrelative position of tokens in the same cell but enforce position invariance\namong different cells. Our technology is free to be plugged into existing\ntable-to-text generation models, and has improved T5-based models to offer\nbetter performance on ToTTo and HiTab.

The proposed method consists of two phases. In the first phase,\nwe determine the interior eigenvalues of the underlying unknown obstacle from\nthe far-field data via the indicating behaviour of the linear sampling method.\nThen we further determine the associated interior eigenfunctions by solving a\nconstrained optimization problem, again only involving the far-field data. In\nthe second phase, we propose a novel iteration scheme of Newton's type to\nidentify the boundary surface of the obstacle. By using the interior\neigenfunctions determined in the first phase, we can avoid computing any direct\nscattering problem at each Newton's iteration. The proposed method is\nparticularly valuable for recovering a sound-hard obstacle, where the Newton's\nformula involves the geometric quantities of the unknown boundary surface in a\nnatural way.

A more promising way is to\nleverage available physical prior and domain knowledge to develop scientific DL\nmodels, known as physics-informed deep learning (PiDL). In most existing PiDL\nframeworks, e.g., physics-informed neural networks, the physics prior is mainly\nutilized to regularize neural network training by incorporating governing\nequations into the loss function in a soft manner. In this work, we propose a\nnew direction to leverage physics prior knowledge by baking the mathematical\nstructures of governing equations into the neural network architecture design.\nIn particular, we develop a novel PDE-preserved neural network (PPNN) for\nrapidly predicting parametric spatiotemporal dynamics, given the governing PDEs\nare (partially) known. The discretized PDE structures are preserved in PPNN as\nconvolutional residual network (ConvResNet) blocks, which are formulated in a\nmulti-resolution setting.

    "abstract": "The vision-based grasp detection method is an important research direction in\nthe field of robotics. However, due to the rectangle metric of the grasp\ndetection rectangle's limitation, a false-positive grasp occurs, resulting in\nthe failure of the real-world robot grasp task. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel generative convolutional neural network model to improve the accuracy and\nrobustness of robot grasp detection in real-world scenes. First, a\nGaussian-based guided training method is used to encode the quality of the\ngrasp point and grasp angle in the grasp pose, highlighting the highest-quality\ngrasp point position and grasp angle and reducing the generation of\nfalse-positive grasps. Simultaneously, deformable convolution is used to obtain\nthe shape features of the object in order to guide the subsequent network to\nthe position. Furthermore, a global-local feature fusion method is introduced\nin order to efficiently obtain finer features during the feature reconstruction\nstage, allowing the network to focus on the features of the grasped objects. On\nthe Cornell Grasping Datasets and Jacquard Datasets, our method achieves\nexcellent performance of 99.0$\\%$ and 95.9$\\%$, respectively.

    "abstract": "Robotic manipulation of deformable linear objects (DLOs) has broad\napplication prospects in many fields. However, a key issue is to obtain the\nexact deformation models (i.e., how robot motion affects DLO deformation),\nwhich are hard to theoretically calculate and vary among different DLOs. Thus,\nshape control of DLOs is challenging, especially for large deformation control\nwhich requires global and more accurate models. In this paper, we propose a\ncoupled offline and online data-driven method for efficiently learning a global\ndeformation model, allowing for both accurate modeling through offline learning\nand further updating for new DLOs via online adaptation. Specifically, the\nmodel approximated by a neural network is first trained offline on random data,\nthen seamlessly migrated to the online phase, and further updated online during\nactual manipulation. Several strategies are introduced to improve the model's\nefficiency and generalization ability. We propose a convex-optimization-based\ncontroller, and analyze the system's stability using the Lyapunov method.\nDetailed simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our method can\nefficiently and precisely estimate the deformation model, and achieve large\ndeformation control of untrained DLOs in 2D and 3D dual-arm manipulation tasks\nbetter than the existing methods. It accomplishes all 24 tasks with different\ndesired shapes on different DLOs in the real world, using only simulation data\nfor the offline learning.",

This increases the\naccuracy of the proposed algorithm by adding clustered data before the final\nclassification step, ensuring a more accurate algorithm.

    "abstract": "This work aims to tackle Model Inversion (MI) attack on Split Federated\nLearning (SFL). SFL is a recent distributed training scheme where multiple\nclients send intermediate activations (i.e., feature map), instead of raw data,\nto a central server. While such a scheme helps reduce the computational load at\nthe client end, it opens itself to reconstruction of raw data from intermediate\nactivation by the server. Existing works on protecting SFL only consider\ninference and do not handle attacks during training. So we propose ResSFL, a\nSplit Federated Learning Framework that is designed to be MI-resistant during\ntraining. It is based on deriving a resistant feature extractor via\nattacker-aware training, and using this extractor to initialize the client-side\nmodel prior to standard SFL training. Such a method helps in reducing the\ncomputational complexity due to use of strong inversion model in client-side\nadversarial training as well as vulnerability of attacks launched in early\ntraining epochs. On CIFAR-100 dataset, our proposed framework successfully\nmitigates MI attack on a VGG-11 model with a high reconstruction\nMean-Square-Error of 0.050 compared to 0.005 obtained by the baseline system.\nThe framework achieves 67.5% accuracy (only 1% accuracy drop) with very low\ncomputation overhead.

By contrast, in wireless communications,\ntypically, both the LoS and NLoS paths are exploited for achieving diversity or\nmultiplexing gains. Hence, we shed light on the NLoS exploitation vs. reduction\ntradeoffs in a monostatic ISAC scenario. In particular, we optimize the\ntransmit power of each signal path to maximize the communication rate, while\nguaranteeing the sensing performance for the target. The non-convex problem\nformulated is firstly solved in closed form for a single-NLoS-link scenario,\nthen we harness the popular successive convex approximation (SCA) method for a\ngeneral multiple-NLoS-link scenario. Our simulation results characterize the\nfundamental performance tradeoffs between sensing and communication,\ndemonstrating that the available DoFs in the ISAC channel should be efficiently\nexploited in a way that is distinctly different from that of communication-only\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of COVID-19 forced schools to swiftly transition from in-person\nclasses to online or remote offerings, making educators and learners alike rely\non online videoconferencing platforms. Platforms like Zoom offer audio-visual\nchannels of communication and include features that are designed to approximate\nthe classroom experience. However, it is not clear how students' learning\nexperiences are affected by affordances of the videoconferencing platforms or\nwhat underlying factors explain the differential effects of these affordances\non class experiences of engagement, interaction, and satisfaction. In order to\nfind out, we conducted two online survey studies: Study 1 (N = 176)\ninvestigated the effects of three types of videoconferencing affordances (i.e.,\nmodality, interactivity, and agency affordances) on class experience during the\nfirst two months after the transition to online learning. Results showed that\nusage of the three kinds of affordances was positively correlated with\nstudents' class engagement, interaction, and satisfaction. Perceived anonymity,\nnonverbal cues, and comfort level were found to be the key mediators. In\naddition, students' usage of video cameras in class was influenced by their\nclassmates. Study 2 (N = 256) tested the proposed relationships at a later\nstage of the pandemic and found similar results, thus serving as a constructive\nreplication. This paper focuses on reporting the results of Study 1 since it\ncaptures the timely reactions from students when they first went online, and\nthe second study plays a supplementary role in verifying Study 1 and thereby\nextending its external validity. Together, the two studies provide insights for\ninstructors on how to leverage different videoconferencing affordances to\nenhance the virtual learning experience.

    "abstract": "We introduce a method for assigning photorealistic relightable materials to\n3D shapes in an automatic manner. Our method takes as input a photo exemplar of\na real object and a 3D object with segmentation, and uses the exemplar to guide\nthe assignment of materials to the parts of the shape, so that the appearance\nof the resulting shape is as similar as possible to the exemplar. To accomplish\nthis goal, our method combines an image translation neural network with a\nmaterial assignment neural network. The image translation network translates\nthe color from the exemplar to a projection of the 3D shape and the part\nsegmentation from the projection to the exemplar. Then, the material prediction\nnetwork assigns materials from a collection of realistic materials to the\nprojected parts, based on the translated images and perceptual similarity of\nthe materials. One key idea of our method is to use the translation network to\nestablish a correspondence between the exemplar and shape projection, which\nallows us to transfer materials between objects with diverse structures.\nAnother key idea of our method is to use the two pairs of (color, segmentation)\nimages provided by the image translation to guide the material assignment,\nwhich enables us to ensure the consistency in the assignment. We demonstrate\nthat our method allows us to assign materials to shapes so that their\nappearances better resemble the input exemplars, improving the quality of the\nresults over the state-of-the-art method, and allowing us to automatically\ncreate thousands of shapes with high-quality photorealistic materials.

This task demands the technique in computer\nvision, natural language processing, and robotics. We bring these disciplines\ntogether on this open challenge, which is essential to human-robot interaction.\nCritically, the key challenge lies in inferring the category of objects from\nlinguistic instructions and accurately estimating the 6-DoF information of\nunseen objects from the known classes. In contrast, previous works focus on\ninferring the pose of object candidates at the instance level. This\nsignificantly limits its applications in real-world scenarios.In this paper, we\npropose a language-guided 6-DoF category-level object localization model to\nachieve robotic grasping by comprehending human intention. To this end, we\npropose a novel two-stage method. Particularly, the first stage grounds the\ntarget in the RGB image through language description of names, attributes, and\nspatial relations of objects. The second stage extracts and segments point\nclouds from the cropped depth image and estimates the full 6-DoF object pose at\ncategory-level. Under such a manner, our approach can locate the specific\nobject by following human instructions, and estimate the full 6-DoF pose of a\ncategory-known but unseen instance which is not utilized for training the\nmodel. Extensive experimental results show that our method is competitive with\nthe state-of-the-art language-conditioned grasp method.

    "abstract": "Model predictive control (MPC) has become the most widely used advanced\ncontrol method in process industry. In many cases, forecasts of the\ndisturbances are available, e.g., predicted renewable power generation based on\nweather forecast. While the predictions of disturbances may not be accurate,\nutilizing the information can significantly improve the control performance in\nresponse to the disturbances. By exploiting process and disturbance models,\nfuture system behaviour can be predicted and used to optimise control actions\nvia minimisation of an economical cost function which incorporates these\npredictions. However, stability guarantee of the resulting closed-loop system\nis often difficult in this approach when the processes are nonlinear. Proposed\nin the following article is a contraction-constrained predictive controller\nwhich optimises process economy whilst ensuring stabilisation to operating\ntargets subject to disturbance measurements and forecasts.",

Existing QA works mostly focus on specific question types,\nknowledge domains, or reasoning skills. The specialty in QA research hinders\nsystems from modeling commonalities between tasks and generalization for wider\napplications. To address this issue, we present ProQA, a unified QA paradigm\nthat solves various tasks through a single model. ProQA takes a unified\nstructural prompt as the bridge and improves the QA-centric ability by\nstructural prompt-based pre-training. Through a structurally designed\nprompt-based input schema, ProQA concurrently models the knowledge\ngeneralization for all QA tasks while keeping the knowledge customization for\nevery specific QA task. Furthermore, ProQA is pre-trained with structural\nprompt-formatted large-scale synthesized corpus, which empowers the model with\nthe commonly-required QA ability. Experimental results on 11 QA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that ProQA consistently boosts performance on both full data\nfine-tuning, few-shot learning, and zero-shot testing scenarios.

In this paper,\nwe investigate the problem of federated unsupervised anomaly detection and\npresent a Federated Exemplar-based Deep Neural Network (Fed-ExDNN) to conduct\nanomaly detection for multivariate time series data on different edge devices.\nSpecifically, we first design an Exemplar-based Deep Neural network (ExDNN) to\nlearn local time series representations based on their compatibility with an\nexemplar module which consists of hidden parameters learned to capture\nvarieties of normal patterns on each edge device. Next, a constrained\nclustering mechanism (FedCC) is employed on the centralized server to align and\naggregate the parameters of different local exemplar modules to obtain a\nunified global exemplar module. Finally, the global exemplar module is deployed\ntogether with a shared feature encoder to each edge device and anomaly\ndetection is conducted by examining the compatibility of testing data to the\nexemplar module. Fed-ExDNN captures local normal time series patterns with\nExDNN and aggregates these patterns by FedCC, and thus can handle the\nheterogeneous data distributed over different edge devices simultaneously.\nThoroughly empirical studies on six public datasets show that ExDNN and\nFed-ExDNN can outperform state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms and\nfederated learning techniques.",

    "abstract": "Despite the plethora of successful Super-Resolution Reconstruction (SRR)\nmodels applied to natural images, their application to remote sensing imagery\ntends to produce poor results. Remote sensing imagery is often more complicated\nthan natural images and has its peculiarities such as being of lower\nresolution, it contains noise, and often depicting large textured surfaces. As\na result, applying non-specialized SRR models on remote sensing imagery results\nin artifacts and poor reconstructions. To address these problems, this paper\nproposes an architecture inspired by previous research work, introducing a\nnovel approach for forcing an SRR model to output realistic remote sensing\nimages: instead of relying on feature-space similarities as a perceptual loss,\nthe model considers pixel-level information inferred from the normalized\nDigital Surface Model (nDSM) of the image. This strategy allows the application\nof better-informed updates during the training of the model which sources from\na task (elevation map inference) that is closely related to remote sensing.\nNonetheless, the nDSM auxiliary information is not required during production\nand thus the model infers a super-resolution image without any additional data\nbesides its low-resolution pairs. We assess our model on two remotely sensed\ndatasets of different spatial resolutions that also contain the DSM pairs of\nthe images: the DFC2018 dataset and the dataset containing the national Lidar\nfly-by of Luxembourg. Based on visual inspection, the inferred super-resolution\nimages exhibit particularly superior quality.

Their ability to boost a model's robustness depends on two\nfactors, viz-a-viz, the model architecture, and the type of augmentations.\nAugmentations are very specific to a dataset, and it is not imperative that all\nkinds of augmentation would necessarily produce a positive effect on a model's\nperformance. Hence there is a need to identify augmentations that perform\nconsistently well across a variety of datasets and also remain invariant to the\ntype of architecture, convolutions, and the number of parameters used. Hence\nthere is a need to identify augmentations that perform consistently well across\na variety of datasets and also remain invariant to the type of architecture,\nconvolutions, and the number of parameters used. This paper evaluates the\neffect of parameters using 3x3 and depth-wise separable convolutions on\ndifferent augmentation techniques on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets.\nStatistical Evidence shows that techniques such as Cutouts and Random\nhorizontal flip were consistent on both parametrically low and high\narchitectures. Depth-wise separable convolutions outperformed 3x3 convolutions\nat higher parameters due to their ability to create deeper networks.\nAugmentations resulted in bridging the accuracy gap between the 3x3 and\ndepth-wise separable convolutions, thus establishing their role in model\ngeneralization.

    "title": "Single-view 3D Body and Cloth Reconstruction under Complex Poses",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D human shape reconstruction from single images have\nshown impressive results, leveraging on deep networks that model the so-called\nimplicit function to learn the occupancy status of arbitrarily dense 3D points\nin space. However, while current algorithms based on this paradigm, like\nPiFuHD, are able to estimate accurate geometry of the human shape and clothes,\nthey require high-resolution input images and are not able to capture complex\nbody poses. Most training and evaluation is performed on 1k-resolution images\nof humans standing in front of the camera under neutral body poses. In this\npaper, we leverage publicly available data to extend existing implicit\nfunction-based models to deal with images of humans that can have arbitrary\nposes and self-occluded limbs. We argue that the representation power of the\nimplicit function is not sufficient to simultaneously model details of the\ngeometry and of the body pose. We, therefore, propose a coarse-to-fine approach\nin which we first learn an implicit function that maps the input image to a 3D\nbody shape with a low level of detail, but which correctly fits the underlying\nhuman pose, despite its complexity. We then learn a displacement map,\nconditioned on the smoothed surface and on the input image, which encodes the\nhigh-frequency details of the clothes and body. In the experimental section, we\nshow that this coarse-to-fine strategy represents a very good trade-off between\nshape detail and pose correctness, comparing favorably to the most recent\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Our code will be made publicly available.",

Quantifying the data\nfreshness through age of information (AoI), in this paper, we jointly design\nsampling and non-slot based scheduling policies to minimize the maximum\ntime-average age of information (MAoI) among sensors with the constraints of\naverage energy cost and finite queue stability. To overcome the intractability\ninvolving high couplings of such a complex stochastic process, we first focus\non the single-sensor time-average AoI optimization problem and convert the\nconstrained Markov decision process (CMDP) into an unconstrained Markov\ndecision process (MDP) by the Lagrangian method. With the infinite-time average\nenergy and AoI expression expended as the Bellman equation, the single-sensor\ntime-average AoI optimization problem can be approached through the\nsteady-state distribution probability. Further, we propose a low-complexity\nsub-optimal sampling and semi-distributed scheduling scheme for the\nmulti-sensor scenario. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme\nreduces the MAoI significantly while achieving a balance between the sampling\nrate and service rate for multiple sensors.",

One of its aims is to preserve the semantic content of text being\ntranslated from source to target domain. However, it does not explicitly\nmaintain other attributes between the source and translated text, for e.g.,\ntext length and descriptiveness. Maintaining constraints in transfer has\nseveral downstream applications, including data augmentation and de-biasing. We\nintroduce a method for such constrained unsupervised text style transfer by\nintroducing two complementary losses to the generative adversarial network\n(GAN) family of models. Unlike the competing losses used in GANs, we introduce\ncooperative losses where the discriminator and the generator cooperate and\nreduce the same loss. The first is a contrastive loss and the second is a\nclassification loss, aiming to regularize the latent space further and bring\nsimilar sentences across domains closer together. We demonstrate that such\ntraining retains lexical, syntactic, and domain-specific constraints between\ndomains for multiple benchmark datasets, including ones where more than one\nattribute change. We show that the complementary cooperative losses improve\ntext quality, according to both automated and human evaluation measures.",

Furthermore, the initial load and capacity of the node are defined,\nrespectively, as well as the load redistribution strategy and the status\njudgment rules for the cascading failure model.

In this paper we study the\nhierarchy of turedos according to their lookup radius and the dimension of\nspace using notions of simulation up to spatio-temporal rescaling (a standard\napproach in cellular automata or self-assembly systems).

Using stricter notions of\nsimulation, intrinsic universality becomes impossible, even in dimension 3, and\nthere is a strict radius hierarchy.

Current KGC research mostly follows\nan entity ranking protocol, wherein the effectiveness is measured by the\npredicted rank of a masked entity in a test triple. The overall performance is\nthen given by a micro(-average) metric over all individual answer entities. Due\nto the incomplete nature of the large-scale knowledge bases, such an entity\nranking setting is likely affected by unlabelled top-ranked positive examples,\nraising questions on whether the current evaluation protocol is sufficient to\nguarantee a fair comparison of KGC systems. To this end, this paper presents a\nsystematic study on whether and how the label sparsity affects the current KGC\nevaluation with the popular micro metrics. Specifically, inspired by the TREC\nparadigm for large-scale information retrieval (IR) experimentation, we create\na relatively \"complete\" judgment set based on a sample from the popular\nFB15k-237 dataset following the TREC pooling method. According to our analysis,\nit comes as a surprise that switching from the original labels to our\n\"complete\" labels results in a drastic change of system ranking of a variety of\n13 popular KGC models in terms of micro metrics. Further investigation\nindicates that the IR-like macro(-average) metrics are more stable and\ndiscriminative under different settings, meanwhile, less affected by label\nsparsity. Thus, for KGC evaluation, we recommend conducting TREC-style pooling\nto balance between human efforts and label completeness, and reporting also the\nIR-like macro metrics to reflect the ranking nature of the KGC task.",

Our investigation also indicates that overall, unsupervised\nlearning methods generalise better than supervised learning models in our\nconsidered scenarios. Using SHAP values to explain these results indicates that\nthe lack of generalisability is mainly due to the presence of strong\ncorrespondence between the values of one or more features and Attack/Benign\nclasses in one dataset-model combination and its absence in other datasets that\nhave different feature distributions.",

For the\ncharging station to take a microgrid (MG) structure, an economical and\nenergy-efficient power management scheme is required for the power provision of\nEVs while considering the local load demand of the MG. For these purposes, this\nstudy presents the power management scheme of interdependent MG and EV fleets\naided by a novel EV charg-ing/discharging scheduling algorithm. In this\nalgorithm, the maximum amount of discharging power from parked EVs is\ndetermined based on the difference between local load demand and photovoltaic\n(PV) power production to alleviate imbalances occurred between them. For the\npower management of the MG with charging/discharging scheduling of parked EVs\nin the PV-based charging station, multi-objective optimization is performed to\nminimize the operating cost and grid dependency. In addition, the proposed\nscheme maximizes the utilization of EV charging/discharging while satisfying\nthe charging requirements of parked EVs. Moreover, a more economical and\nenergy-efficient PV-based charging station is established using the future\ntrends of local load demand and PV power production predicted by a gated\nrecurrent unit (GRU) network.

    "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to study convergence and error estimates of the\nMonte Carlo method for the Navier-Stokes equations with random data. To\ndiscretize in space and time, the Monte Carlo method is combined with a\nsuitable deterministic discretization scheme, such as a finite volume method.\nWe assume that the initial data, force and the viscosity coefficients are\nrandom variables and study both, the statistical convergence rates as well as\nthe approximation errors. Since the compressible Navier-Stokes equations are\nnot known to be uniquely solvable in the class of global weak solutions, we\ncannot apply pathwise arguments to analyze the random Navier-Stokes equations.\nInstead we have to apply intrinsic stochastic compactness arguments via the\nSkorokhod representation theorem and the Gy\\\"{o}ngy-Krylov method. Assuming\nthat the numerical solutions are bounded in probability, we prove that the\nMonte Carlo finite volume method converges to a statistical strong solution.\nThe convergence rates are discussed as well. Numerical experiments illustrate\ntheoretical results.",

    "abstract": "In 3D face reconstruction, orthogonal projection has been widely employed to\nsubstitute perspective projection to simplify the fitting process. This\napproximation performs well when the distance between camera and face is far\nenough. However, in some scenarios that the face is very close to camera or\nmoving along the camera axis, the methods suffer from the inaccurate\nreconstruction and unstable temporal fitting due to the distortion under the\nperspective projection. In this paper, we aim to address the problem of\nsingle-image 3D face reconstruction under perspective projection. Specifically,\na deep neural network, Perspective Network (PerspNet), is proposed to\nsimultaneously reconstruct 3D face shape in canonical space and learn the\ncorrespondence between 2D pixels and 3D points, by which the 6DoF (6 Degrees of\nFreedom) face pose can be estimated to represent perspective projection.\nBesides, we contribute a large ARKitFace dataset to enable the training and\nevaluation of 3D face reconstruction solutions under the scenarios of\nperspective projection, which has 902,724 2D facial images with ground-truth 3D\nface mesh and annotated 6DoF pose parameters.

Such a discussion is necessary for optimal system design,\nleveraging advanced data-processing capabilities to support decision-making\ninvolving humans, but it is also key to identifying the opportunities and risks\npresented by ever-increasing levels of machine autonomy. Within this context,\nwe focus on the following questions: (i) How does HCI currently look like for\nstate-of-the-art AutoML algorithms, especially during the stages of\ndevelopment, deployment, and maintenance? (ii) Do the expectations of HCI\nwithin AutoML frameworks vary for different types of users and stakeholders?\n(iii) How can HCI be managed so that AutoML solutions acquire human trust and\nbroad acceptance? (iv) As AutoML systems become more autonomous and capable of\nlearning from complex open-ended environments, will the fundamental nature of\nHCI evolve? To consider these questions, we project existing literature in HCI\ninto the space of AutoML; this connection has, to date, largely been\nunexplored. In so doing, we review topics including user-interface design,\nhuman-bias mitigation, and trust in artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally,\nto rigorously gauge the future of HCI, we contemplate how AutoML may manifest\nin effectively open-ended environments. This discussion necessarily reviews\nprojected developmental pathways for AutoML, such as the incorporation of\nreasoning, although the focus remains on how and why HCI may occur in such a\nframework rather than on any implementational details.

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in many areas, more\nand more studies focus on protecting DNN models from intellectual property (IP)\ninfringement. Many existing methods apply digital watermarking to protect the\nDNN models. The majority of them either embed a watermark directly into the\ninternal network structure/parameters or insert a zero-bit watermark by\nfine-tuning a model to be protected with a set of so-called trigger samples.\nThough these methods work very well, they were designed for individual DNN\nmodels, which cannot be directly applied to deep ensemble models (DEMs) that\ncombine multiple DNN models to make the final decision. It motivates us to\npropose a novel black-box watermarking method in this paper for DEMs, which can\nbe used for verifying the integrity of DEMs. In the proposed method, a certain\nnumber of sensitive samples are carefully selected through mimicking real-world\nDEM attacks and analyzing the prediction results of the sub-models of the\nnon-attacked DEM and the attacked DEM on the carefully crafted dataset. By\nanalyzing the prediction results of the target DEM on these carefully crafted\nsensitive samples, we are able to verify the integrity of the target DEM.\nDifferent from many previous methods, the proposed method does not modify the\noriginal DEM to be protected, which indicates that the proposed method is\nlossless. Experimental results have shown that the DEM integrity can be\nreliably verified even if only one sub-model was attacked, which has good\npotential in practice.",

To obtain fine-grained visual features,we present\ncontrastive learning supervised by click through data to fine-tune the visual\nencoder. To reduce sample selection bias, firstly we train the visual encoder\noffline by leveraging both unbiased self-supervision and click supervision\nsignals. Secondly, we incorporate a debiasing network in the online CTR\npredictor to adjust the visual features by contrasting high impression items\nwith selected items with lower impressions.We deploy the framework in the\nvisual sponsor search system at Alibaba. Offline experiments on billion-scale\ndatasets and online experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can\nmake accurate and unbiased predictions.",

    "abstract": "Multi-fingered hands could be used to achieve many dexterous manipulation\ntasks, similarly to humans, and tactile sensing could enhance the manipulation\nstability for a variety of objects. However, tactile sensors on multi-fingered\nhands have a variety of sizes and shapes. Convolutional neural networks (CNN)\ncan be useful for processing tactile information, but the information from\nmulti-fingered hands needs an arbitrary pre-processing, as CNNs require a\nrectangularly shaped input, which may lead to unstable results. Therefore, how\nto process such complex shaped tactile information and utilize it for achieving\nmanipulation skills is still an open issue. This paper presents a control\nmethod based on a graph convolutional network (GCN) which extracts geodesical\nfeatures from the tactile data with complicated sensor alignments. Moreover,\nobject property labels are provided to the GCN to adjust in-hand manipulation\nmotions. Distributed tri-axial tactile sensors are mounted on the fingertips,\nfinger phalanges and palm of an Allegro hand, resulting in 1152 tactile\nmeasurements. Training data is collected with a data-glove to transfer human\ndexterous manipulation directly to the robot hand. The GCN achieved high\nsuccess rates for in-hand manipulation. We also confirmed that fragile objects\nwere deformed less when correct object labels were provided to the GCN. When\nvisualizing the activation of the GCN with a PCA, we verified that the network\nacquired geodesical features. Our method achieved stable manipulation even when\nan experimenter pulled a grasped object and for untrained objects.",

However, existing monocular hair modeling methods are either tricky to\ndeploy in digital systems (e.g., due to their dependence on complex user\ninteractions or large databases) or can produce only a coarse geometry. In this\npaper, we introduce NeuralHDHair, a flexible, fully automatic system for\nmodeling high-fidelity hair from a single image. The key enablers of our system\nare two carefully designed neural networks: an IRHairNet (Implicit\nrepresentation for hair using neural network) for inferring high-fidelity 3D\nhair geometric features (3D orientation field and 3D occupancy field)\nhierarchically and a GrowingNet(Growing hair strands using neural network) to\nefficiently generate 3D hair strands in parallel.

To improve the efficiency of\na traditional hair growth algorithm, we adopt a local neural implicit function\nto grow strands based on the estimated 3D hair geometric features.

    "abstract": "In distributed or federated optimization and learning, communication between\nthe different computing units is often the bottleneck, and gradient compression\nis a widely used technique for reducing the number of bits sent within each\ncommunication round of iterative methods. There are two classes of compression\noperators and separate algorithms making use of them. In the case of unbiased\nrandom compressors with bounded variance (e.g., rand-k), the DIANA algorithm of\nMishchenko et al. [2019], which implements a variance reduction technique for\nhandling the variance introduced by compression, is the current state of the\nart. In the case of biased and contractive compressors (e.g., top-k), the EF21\nalgorithm of Richt\\'arik et al. [2021], which implements an error-feedback\nmechanism for handling the error introduced by compression, is the current\nstate of the art. These two classes of compression schemes and algorithms are\ndistinct, with different analyses and proof techniques. In this paper, we unify\nthem into a single framework and propose a new algorithm, recovering DIANA and\nEF21 as particular cases. We prove linear convergence under certain conditions.\nOur general approach works with a new, larger class of compressors, which\nincludes unbiased and biased compressors as particular cases, and has two\nparameters, the bias and the variance. These gives a finer control and allows\nus to inherit the best of the two worlds: biased compressors, whose good\nperformance in practice is recognized, can be used. And independent randomness\nat the compressors allows to mitigate the effects of compression, with the\nconvergence rate improving when the number of parallel workers is large.

    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation aims to predict items that an anonymous user\nwould like to purchase based on her short behavior sequence. The current\napproaches towards session-based recommendation only focus on modeling users'\ninterest preferences, while they all ignore a key attribute of an item, i.e.,\nthe price. Many marketing studies have shown that the price factor\nsignificantly influences users' behaviors and the purchase decisions of users\nare determined by both price and interest preferences simultaneously. However,\nit is nontrivial to incorporate price preferences for session-based\nrecommendation. Firstly, it is hard to handle heterogeneous information from\nvarious features of items to capture users' price preferences. Secondly, it is\ndifficult to model the complex relations between price and interest preferences\nin determining user choices.\nTo address the above challenges, we propose a novel method Co-guided\nHeterogeneous Hypergraph Network (CoHHN) for session-based recommendation.\nTowards the first challenge, we devise a heterogeneous hypergraph to represent\nheterogeneous information and rich relations among them. A dual-channel\naggregating mechanism is then designed to aggregate various information in the\nheterogeneous hypergraph. After that, we extract users' price preferences and\ninterest preferences via attention layers. As to the second challenge, a\nco-guided learning scheme is designed to model the relations between price and\ninterest preferences and enhance the learning of each other. Finally, we\npredict user actions based on item features and users' price and interest\npreferences. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed CoHHN. Further analysis reveals the significance\nof price for session-based recommendation.",

    "abstract": "The performance of highly parallel applications on distributed-memory systems\nis influenced by many factors. Analytic performance modeling techniques aim to\nprovide insight into performance limitations and are often the starting point\nof optimization efforts. However, coupling analytic models across the system\nhierarchy (socket, node, network) fails to encompass the intricate interplay\nbetween the program code and the hardware, especially when execution and\ncommunication bottlenecks are involved. In this paper we investigate the effect\nof \"bottleneck evasion\" and how it can lead to automatic overlap of\ncommunication overhead with computation. Bottleneck evasion leads to a gradual\nloss of the initial bulk-synchronous behavior of a parallel code so that its\nprocesses become desynchronized. This occurs most prominently in memory-bound\nprograms, which is why we choose memory-bound benchmark and application codes,\nspecifically an MPI-augmented STREAM Triad, sparse matrix-vector\nmultiplication, and a collective-avoiding Chebyshev filter diagonalization code\nto demonstrate the consequences of desynchronization on two different\nsupercomputing platforms. We investigate the role of idle waves as possible\ntriggers for desynchronization and show the impact of automatic asynchronous\ncommunication for a spectrum of code properties and parameters, such as\nsaturation point, matrix structures, domain decomposition, and communication\nconcurrency. Our findings reveal how eliminating synchronization points (such\nas collective communication or barriers) precipitates performance improvements\nthat go beyond what can be expected by simply subtracting the overhead of the\ncollective from the overall runtime.",

    "abstract": "Robust imitation learning using disturbance injections overcomes issues of\nlimited variation in demonstrations. However, these methods assume\ndemonstrations are optimal, and that policy stabilization can be learned via\nsimple augmentations. In real-world scenarios, demonstrations are often of\ndiverse-quality, and disturbance injection instead learns sub-optimal policies\nthat fail to replicate desired behavior. To address this issue, this paper\nproposes a novel imitation learning framework that combines both policy\nrobustification and optimal demonstration learning. Specifically, this\ncombinatorial approach forces policy learning and disturbance injection\noptimization to focus on mainly learning from high task achievement\ndemonstrations, while utilizing low achievement ones to decrease the number of\nsamples needed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through\nexperiments using an excavation task in both simulations and a real robot,\nresulting in high-achieving policies that are more stable and robust to\ndiverse-quality demonstrations. In addition, this method utilizes all of the\nweighted sub-optimal demonstrations without eliminating them, resulting in\npractical data efficiency benefits.",

    "abstract": "The window mechanism, introduced by Chatterjee et al. for mean-payoff and\ntotal-payoff objectives in two-player turn-based games on graphs, refines\nlong-term objectives with time bounds. This mechanism has proven useful in a\nvariety of settings, and most recently in timed systems.\nIn the timed setting, the so-called fixed timed window parity objectives have\nbeen studied. A fixed timed window parity objective is defined with respect to\nsome time bound and requires that, at all times, we witness a time frame, i.e.,\na window, of size less than the fixed bound in which the smallest priority is\neven. In this work, we focus on the bounded timed window parity objective. Such\nan objective is satisfied if there exists some bound for which the fixed\nobjective is satisfied. The satisfaction of bounded objectives is robust to\nmodeling choices such as constants appearing in constraints, unlike fixed\nobjectives, for which the choice of constants may affect the satisfaction for a\ngiven bound.\nWe show that verification of bounded timed window objectives in timed\nautomata can be performed in polynomial space, and that timed games with these\nobjectives can be solved in exponential time, even for multi-objective\nextensions. This matches the complexity classes of the fixed case. We also\nprovide a comparison of the different variants of window parity objectives.",

In this paper, we evaluate a\nnew approach to query building in which users express concepts as objects on a\nvisual canvas and compare this with traditional form-based query building in a\nlab-based user study. The results demonstrate the potential of visual\ninterfaces to mitigate some of the shortcomings associated with form-based\ninterfaces and encourage more exploratory search behaviour.

We\ntrace both the historical roots and current landmark work that have been\nshaping the field and categorize these works under three broad umbrellas: (i)\nthose grounded in Western canonical philosophy, (ii) mathematical and\nstatistical methods, and (iii) those emerging from critical\ndata/algorithm/information studies. We also survey the field and explore\nemerging trends by examining the rapidly growing body of literature that falls\nunder the broad umbrella of AI Ethics. To that end, we read and annotated\npeer-reviewed papers published over the past four years in two premier\nconferences: FAccT and AIES. We organize the literature based on an annotation\nscheme we developed according to three main dimensions: whether the paper deals\nwith concrete applications, use-cases, and/or people's lived experience; to\nwhat extent it addresses harmed, threatened, or otherwise marginalized groups;\nand if so, whether it explicitly names such groups. We note that although the\ngoals of the majority of FAccT and AIES papers were often commendable, their\nconsideration of the negative impacts of AI on traditionally marginalized\ngroups remained shallow. Taken together, our conceptual analysis and the data\nfrom annotated papers indicate that the field would benefit from an increased\nfocus on ethical analysis grounded in concrete use-cases, people's experiences,\nand applications as well as from approaches that are sensitive to structural\nand historical power asymmetries.",

    "abstract": "Visual inspection software has become a key factor in the manufacturing\nindustry for quality control and process monitoring. Semantic segmentation\nmodels have gained importance since they allow for more precise examination.\nThese models, however, require large image datasets in order to achieve a fair\naccuracy level. In some cases, training data is sparse or lacks of sufficient\nannotation, a fact that especially applies to highly specialized production\nenvironments. Data augmentation represents a common strategy to extend the\ndataset. Still, it only varies the image within a narrow range. In this\narticle, a novel strategy is proposed to augment small image datasets. The\napproach is applied to surface monitoring of carbon fibers, a specific industry\nuse case. We apply two different methods to create binary labels: a\nproblem-tailored trigonometric function and a WGAN model. Afterwards, the\nlabels are translated into color images using pix2pix and used to train a\nU-Net. The results suggest that the trigonometric function is superior to the\nWGAN model. However, a precise examination of the resulting images indicate\nthat WGAN and image-to-image translation achieve good segmentation results and\nonly deviate to a small degree from traditional data augmentation. In summary,\nthis study examines an industry application of data synthesization using\ngenerative adversarial networks and explores its potential for monitoring\nsystems of production environments. \\keywords{Image-to-Image Translation,\nCarbon Fiber, Data Augmentation, Computer Vision, Industrial Monitoring,\nAdversarial Learning.",

In turn, interactive Boolean evaluation aims\nat unveiling the underlying truth value of a Boolean expression by frugally\nprobing the truth values of individual values. The required number of probes\ndepends on the Boolean provenance structure and on the (a-priori unknown) probe\nanswers. Prior work has analyzed and aimed to optimize the expected number of\nprobes, where expectancy is with respect to a probability distribution over\nprobe answers. This paper gives a novel worst-case analysis for the problem,\ninspired by the decision tree depth of Boolean functions.\nSpecifically, we introduce a notion of evasive provenance expressions, namely\nexpressions, where one may need to probe all variables in the worst case. We\nshow that read-once expressions are evasive, and identify an additional class\nof expressions (acyclic monotone 2-DNF) for which evasiveness may be decided in\nPTIME. As for the more general question of finding the optimal strategy, we\nshow that it is coNP-hard in general. We are still able to identify a sub-class\nof provenance expressions that is \"far from evasive\", namely, where an optimal\nworst-case strategy probes only log(n) out of the n variables in the\nexpression, and show that we can find this optimal strategy in polynomial time.",

    "title": "Enough Hot Air: The Role of Immersion Cooling",
    "abstract": "Air cooling is the traditional solution to chill servers in data centers.\nHowever, the continuous increase in global data center energy consumption\ncombined with the increase of the racks' power dissipation calls for the use of\nmore efficient alternatives. Immersion cooling is one such alternative. In this\npaper, we quantitatively examine and compare air cooling and immersion cooling\nsolutions. The examined characteristics include power usage efficiency (PUE),\ncomputing and power density, cost, and maintenance overheads. A direct\ncomparison shows a reduction of about 50% in energy consumption and a reduction\nof about two-thirds of the occupied space, by using immersion cooling. In\naddition, the higher heat capacity of used liquids in immersion cooling\ncompared to air allows for much higher rack power densities. Moreover,\nimmersion cooling requires less capital and operational expenditures. However,\nchallenging maintenance procedures together with the increased number of IT\nfailures are the main downsides. By selecting immersion cooling, cloud\nproviders must trade-off the decrease in energy and cost and the increase in\npower density with its higher maintenance and reliability concerns. Finally, we\nargue that retrofitting an air-cooled data center with immersion cooling will\nresult in high costs and is generally not recommended.",

The deep manifold sampler was recently proposed as a\nmeans to iteratively sample variable-length protein sequences by exploiting the\ngradients from a function predictor. We introduce an alternative approach to\nthis guided sampling procedure, multi-segment preserving sampling, that enables\nthe direct inclusion of domain-specific knowledge by designating preserved and\nnon-preserved segments along the input sequence, thereby restricting variation\nto only select regions. We present its effectiveness in the context of antibody\ndesign by training two models: a deep manifold sampler and a GPT-2 language\nmodel on nearly six million heavy chain sequences annotated with the IGHV1-18\ngene. During sampling, we restrict variation to only the\ncomplementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the input.

Researchers have studied\ntextual, visual, and audio content, but typically in isolation. Yet, harmful\ncontent often combines multiple modalities, as in the case of memes, which are\nof particular interest due to their viral nature. With this in mind, here we\noffer a comprehensive survey with a focus on harmful memes. Based on a\nsystematic analysis of recent literature, we first propose a new typology of\nharmful memes, and then we highlight and summarize the relevant state of the\nart. One interesting finding is that many types of harmful memes are not really\nstudied, e.g., such featuring self-harm and extremism, partly due to the lack\nof suitable datasets. We further find that existing datasets mostly capture\nmulti-class scenarios, which are not inclusive of the affective spectrum that\nmemes can represent. Another observation is that memes can propagate globally\nthrough repackaging in different languages and that they can also be\nmultilingual, blending different cultures. We conclude by highlighting several\nchallenges related to multimodal semiotics, technological constraints and\nnon-trivial social engagement, and we present several open-ended aspects such\nas delineating online harm and empirically examining related frameworks and\nassistive interventions, which we believe will motivate and drive future\nresearch.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a learning-based visual peg-in-hole that enables training\nwith several shapes in simulation, and adapting to arbitrary unseen shapes in\nreal world with minimal sim-to-real cost. The core idea is to decouple the\ngeneralization of the sensory-motor policy to the design of a fast-adaptable\nperception module and a simulated generic policy module. The framework consists\nof a segmentation network (SN), a virtual sensor network (VSN), and a\ncontroller network (CN). Concretely, the VSN is trained to measure the pose of\nthe unseen shape from a segmented image. After that, given the shape-agnostic\npose measurement, the CN is trained to achieve generic peg-in-hole. Finally,\nwhen applying to real unseen holes, we only have to fine-tune the SN required\nby the simulated VSN+CN. To further minimize the transfer cost, we propose to\nautomatically collect and annotate the data for the SN after one-minute human\nteaching. Simulated and real-world results are presented under the\nconfigurations of eye-to/in-hand. An electric vehicle charging system with the\nproposed policy inside achieves a 10/10 success rate in 2-3s, using only\nhundreds of auto-labeled samples for the SN transfer.",

    "title": "Multi-modal Semantic SLAM for Complex Dynamic Environments",
    "abstract": "Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is one of the most essential\ntechniques in many real-world robotic applications. The assumption of static\nenvironments is common in most SLAM algorithms, which however, is not the case\nfor most applications. Recent work on semantic SLAM aims to understand the\nobjects in an environment and distinguish dynamic information from a scene\ncontext by performing image-based segmentation. However, the segmentation\nresults are often imperfect or incomplete, which can subsequently reduce the\nquality of mapping and the accuracy of localization. In this paper, we present\na robust multi-modal semantic framework to solve the SLAM problem in complex\nand highly dynamic environments. We propose to learn a more powerful object\nfeature representation and deploy the mechanism of looking and thinking twice\nto the backbone network, which leads to a better recognition result to our\nbaseline instance segmentation model. Moreover, both geometric-only clustering\nand visual semantic information are combined to reduce the effect of\nsegmentation error due to small-scale objects, occlusion and motion blur.\nThorough experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the\nproposed method. The results show that our method can precisely identify\ndynamic objects under recognition imperfection and motion blur. Moreover, the\nproposed SLAM framework is able to efficiently build a static dense map at a\nprocessing rate of more than 10 Hz, which can be implemented in many practical\napplications. Both training data and the proposed method is open sourced at\nhttps://github.com/wh200720041/MMS_SLAM.",

In this\npaper, we propose CounterGeDi - an ensemble of generative discriminators (GeDi)\nto guide the generation of a DialoGPT model toward more polite, detoxified, and\nemotionally laden counterspeech. We generate counterspeech using three datasets\nand observe significant improvement across different attribute scores. The\npoliteness and detoxification scores increased by around 15% and 6%\nrespectively, while the emotion in the counterspeech increased by at least 10%\nacross all the datasets. We also experiment with triple-attribute control and\nobserve significant improvement over single attribute results when combining\ncomplementing attributes, e.g., politeness, joyfulness and detoxification.

    "abstract": "We study turn-based quantitative games of infinite duration opposing two\nantagonistic players and played over graphs. This model is widely accepted as\nproviding the adequate framework for formalizing the synthesis question for\nreactive systems. This important application motivates the question of strategy\ncomplexity: which valuations (or payoff functions) admit optimal positional\nstrategies (without memory)? Valuations for which both players have optimal\npositional strategies have been characterized by Gimbert and Zielonka for\nfinite graphs and by Colcombet and Niwi\\'nski for infinite graphs.\nHowever, for reactive synthesis, existence of optimal positional strategies\nfor the opponent (which models an antagonistic environment) is irrelevant.\nDespite this fact, not much is known about valuations for which the protagonist\nadmits optimal positional strategies, regardless of the opponent. In this work,\nwe characterize valuations which admit such strategies over infinite graphs.\nOur characterization uses the vocabulary of universal graphs, which has also\nproved useful in understanding recent breakthrough results regarding the\ncomplexity of parity games.\nMore precisely, we show that a valuation admitting universal graphs which are\nmonotonic and well-ordered is positional over all game graphs, and -- more\nsurprisingly -- that the converse is also true for valuations admitting neutral\ncolors. We prove the applicability and elegance of the framework by unifying a\nnumber of known positionality results, proving a few stronger ones, and\nestablishing closure under lexicographical products.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous mobility on demand services have the potential to disrupt the\nfuture mobility system landscape. Ridepooling services in particular can\ndecrease land consumption and increase transportation efficiency by increasing\nthe average vehicle occupancy. Nevertheless, because ridepooling services\nrequire a sufficient user base for pooling to take effect, their performance\ncan suffer if multiple operators offer such a service and must split the\ndemand. This study presents a simulation framework for evaluating the impact of\ncompetition and cooperation among multiple ridepooling providers. Two different\nkinds of interaction via a broker platform are compared with the base cases of\na single monopolistic operator and two independent operators with divided\ndemand. In the first, the broker presents trip offers from all operators to\ncustomers (similar to a mobility-as-a-service platform), who can then freely\nchoose an operator. In the second, a regulated broker platform can manipulate\noperator offers with the goal of shifting the customer-operator assignment from\na user equilibrium towards a system optimum. To model adoptions of the service\ndesign depending on the different interaction scenario, a game setting is\nintroduced. Within alternating turns between operators, operators can adapt\nparameters of their service (fleet size and objective function) to maximize\nprofit. Results for a case study based on Manhattan taxi data, show that\noperators generate the highest profit in the broker setting while operating the\nlargest fleet. Additionally, pooling efficiency can nearly be maintained\ncompared to a single operator. With the resulting increased service rate, the\nregulated competition benefits not only operators (profit) and cities\n(increased pooling efficiency), but also customers. Contrarily, when users can\ndecide freely, the lowest pooling efficiency and operator profit is observed.",

In\ndetails, while homomorphic encryption blinds a semi-honest server at learning\nstage, differential privacy protects the data from semi-honest clients\nparticipating in the training process as well as curious end-users with\nblack-box or white-box access to the trained model. This paper provides with\nnew theoretical and practical results to enable these techniques to be\neffectively combined. In particular, by means of a novel stochastic\nquantization operator, we prove differential privacy guarantees in a context\nwhere the noise is quantified and bounded due to the use of homomorphic\nencryption.

    "abstract": "Automotive embedded algorithms have very high constraints in terms of\nlatency, accuracy and power consumption. In this work, we propose to train\nspiking neural networks (SNNs) directly on data coming from event cameras to\ndesign fast and efficient automotive embedded applications. Indeed, SNNs are\nmore biologically realistic neural networks where neurons communicate using\ndiscrete and asynchronous spikes, a naturally energy-efficient and hardware\nfriendly operating mode. Event data, which are binary and sparse in space and\ntime, are therefore the ideal input for spiking neural networks. But to date,\ntheir performance was insufficient for automotive real-world problems, such as\ndetecting complex objects in an uncontrolled environment. To address this\nissue, we took advantage of the latest advancements in matter of spike\nbackpropagation - surrogate gradient learning, parametric LIF, SpikingJelly\nframework - and of our new \\textit{voxel cube} event encoding to train 4\ndifferent SNNs based on popular deep learning networks: SqueezeNet, VGG,\nMobileNet, and DenseNet. As a result, we managed to increase the size and the\ncomplexity of SNNs usually considered in the literature. In this paper, we\nconducted experiments on two automotive event datasets, establishing new\nstate-of-the-art classification results for spiking neural networks. Based on\nthese results, we combined our SNNs with SSD to propose the first spiking\nneural networks capable of performing object detection on the complex GEN1\nAutomotive Detection event dataset.",

    "abstract": "Efficient prediction of internet traffic is an essential part of Self\nOrganizing Network (SON) for ensuring proactive management. There are many\nexisting solutions for internet traffic prediction with higher accuracy using\ndeep learning. But designing individual predictive models for each service\nprovider in the network is challenging due to data heterogeneity, scarcity, and\nabnormality. Moreover, the performance of the deep sequence model in network\ntraffic prediction with limited training data has not been studied extensively\nin the current works. In this paper, we investigated and evaluated the\nperformance of the deep transfer learning technique in traffic prediction with\ninadequate historical data leveraging the knowledge of our pre-trained model.\nFirst, we used a comparatively larger real-world traffic dataset for source\ndomain prediction based on five different deep sequence models: Recurrent\nNeural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), LSTM Encoder-Decoder\n(LSTM_En_De), LSTM_En_De with Attention layer (LSTM_En_De_Atn), and Gated\nRecurrent Unit (GRU). Then, two best-performing models, LSTM_En_De and\nLSTM_En_De_Atn, from the source domain with an accuracy of 96.06% and 96.05%\nare considered for the target domain prediction. Finally, four smaller traffic\ndatasets collected for four particular sources and destination pairs are used\nin the target domain to compare the performance of the standard learning and\ntransfer learning in terms of accuracy and execution time. According to our\nexperimental result, transfer learning helps to reduce the execution time for\nmost cases, while the model's accuracy is improved in transfer learning with a\nlarger training session.",

By removing redundant or noisy\nfeatures, the accuracy of ranking or classification can be improved and the\ncomputational cost of the subsequent learning steps can be reduced.

While for\ndecades confined to theoretical algorithmic papers, quantum computing is now\nbecoming a viable tool to tackle realistic problems, in particular\nspecial-purpose solvers based on the Quantum Annealing paradigm. This paper\naims to explore the feasibility of using currently available quantum computing\narchitectures to solve some quadratic feature selection algorithms for both\nranking and classification. The experimental analysis includes 15\nstate-of-the-art datasets. The effectiveness obtained with quantum computing\nhardware is comparable to that of classical solvers, indicating that quantum\ncomputers are now reliable enough to tackle interesting problems. In terms of\nscalability, current generation quantum computers are able to provide a limited\nspeedup over certain classical algorithms and hybrid quantum-classical\nstrategies show lower computational cost for problems of more than a thousand\nfeatures.",

    "abstract": "Purpose. Ability to locate and track ultrasound images in the 3D operating\nspace is of great benefit for multiple clinical applications. This is often\naccomplished by tracking the probe using a precise but expensive optical or\nelectromagnetic tracking system. Our goal is to develop a simple and low cost\naugmented reality echography framework using a standard RGB-D Camera.\nMethods. A prototype system consisting of an Occipital Structure Core RGB-D\ncamera, a specifically-designed 3D marker, and a fast point cloud registration\nalgorithm FaVoR was developed and evaluated on an Ultrasonix ultrasound system.\nThe probe was calibrated on a 3D-printed N-wire phantom using the software PLUS\ntoolkit. The proposed calibration method is simplified, requiring no additional\nmarkers or sensors attached to the phantom. Also, a visualization software\nbased on OpenGL was developed for the augmented reality application.\nResults. The calibrated probe was used to augment a real-world video in a\nsimulated needle insertion scenario. The ultrasound images were rendered on the\nvideo, and visually-coherent results were observed. We evaluated the end-to-end\naccuracy of our AR US framework on localizing a cube of 5 cm size. From our two\nexperiments, the target pose localization error ranges from 5.6 to 5.9 mm and\nfrom -3.9 to 4.2 degrees.\nConclusion. We believe that with the potential democratization of RGB-D\ncameras integrated in mobile devices and AR glasses in the future, our\nprototype solution may facilitate the use of 3D freehand ultrasound in clinical\nroutine. Future work should include a more rigorous and thorough evaluation, by\ncomparing the calibration accuracy with those obtained by commercial tracking\nsolutions in both simulated and real medical scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is a pivotal technology in application domains that\nrequire connectivity and interoperability between large numbers of devices. IoT\nsystems predominantly use a software-defined network (SDN) architecture as\ntheir core communication backbone. This architecture offers several advantages,\nincluding the flexibility to make IoT networks self-adaptive through software\nprogrammability. In general, self-adaptation solutions need to periodically\nmonitor, reason about, and adapt a running system. The adaptation step involves\ngenerating an adaptation strategy and applying it to the running system\nwhenever an anomaly arises. In this paper, we argue that, rather than\ngenerating individual adaptation strategies, the goal should be to adapt the\nlogic / code of the running system in such a way that the system itself would\nlearn how to steer clear of future anomalies, without triggering\nself-adaptation too frequently. We instantiate and empirically assess this idea\nin the context of IoT networks. Specifically, using genetic programming (GP),\nwe propose a self-adaptation solution that continuously learns and updates the\ncontrol constructs in the data-forwarding logic of SDN-based IoT networks. Our\nevaluation, performed using open-source synthetic and industrial data,\nindicates that, compared to a baseline adaptation technique that attempts to\ngenerate individual adaptations, our GP-based approach is more effective in\nresolving network congestion, and further, reduces the frequency of adaptation\ninterventions over time. In addition, we compare our approach against a\nstandard data-forwarding algorithm from the network literature, demonstrating\nthat our approach significantly reduces packet loss.",

Here, one\nis faced with a severe incompatibility in geometry representation: While CAD is\nusually based on surface representations, analysis mostly relies on volumetric\nrepresentations. The forward pass, i.e., converting CAD data to computational\nmeshes, is well understood and established. However, the same does not hold for\nthe inverse direction, i.e., CAD reconstruction of deformed geometries\nresulting, e.g., from shape optimization. The few reconstruction methods\nreported mainly rely on spline fitting, in particular methods that rely on\ncreating new splines simililar to shape reconstruction from 3D imaging. In\ncontrast, this paper studies a novel approach that reuses the CAD data given in\nthe initial design. We show that this concept leads to precise shape\nreconstructions while also preserving the initial notion of features defined\nduring design. Furthermore, reusing the initial CAD representation reduces the\nshape reconstruction problem to a shape modification problem. We study this\nunique feature and show that it enables the reconstruction of CAD data from\ncomputational meshes by composing each spline in the initial CAD data with a\nsingle, global deformation spline. While post-processing is needed for use in\ncurrent CAD software, this novel approach not only allows creating watertight\nmodels, but also enables reconstructing complete CAD models even from\ndefeatured computational meshes.",

    "abstract": "Significant progress has been made on visual captioning, largely relying on\npre-trained features and later fixed object detectors that serve as rich inputs\nto auto-regressive models. A key limitation of such methods, however, is that\nthe output of the model is conditioned only on the object detector's outputs.\nThe assumption that such outputs can represent all necessary information is\nunrealistic, especially when the detector is transferred across datasets. In\nthis work, we reason about the graphical model induced by this assumption, and\npropose to add an auxiliary input to represent missing information such as\nobject relationships. We specifically propose to mine attributes and\nrelationships from the Visual Genome dataset and condition the captioning model\non them. Crucially, we propose (and show to be important) the use of a\nmulti-modal pre-trained model (CLIP) to retrieve such contextual descriptions.\nFurther, object detector models are frozen and do not have sufficient richness\nto allow the captioning model to properly ground them. As a result, we propose\nto condition both the detector and description outputs on the image, and show\nqualitatively and quantitatively that this can improve grounding. We validate\nour method on image captioning, perform thorough analyses of each component and\nimportance of the pre-trained multi-modal model, and demonstrate significant\nimprovements over the current state of the art, specifically +7.5% in CIDEr and\n+1.3% in BLEU-4 metrics.",

    "abstract": "It is not accurate to make recommendations only based one single current\nsession. Therefore, multi-session-based recommendation(MSBR) is a solution for\nthe problem. Compared with the previous MSBR models, we have made three\nimprovements in this paper. First, the previous work choose to use all the\nhistory sessions of the user and/or of his similar users. When the user's\ncurrent interest changes greatly from the past, most of these sessions can only\nhave negative impacts. Therefore, we select a large number of randomly chosen\nsessions from the dataset as candidate sessions to avoid over depending on\nhistory data. Then we only choose to use the most similar sessions to get the\nmost useful information while reduce the noise caused by dissimilar sessions.\nSecond, in real-world datasets, short sessions account for a large proportion.\nThe RNN often used in previous work is not suitable to process short sessions,\nbecause RNN only focuses on the sequential relationship, which we find is not\nthe only relationship between items in short sessions. So, we designed a more\nsuitable method named GAFE based on attention to process short sessions. Third,\nAlthough there are few long sessions, they can not be ignored. Not like\nprevious models, which simply process long sessions in the same way as short\nsessions, we propose LSIS, which can split the interest of long sessions, to\nmake better use of long sessions. Finally, to help recommendations, we also\nhave considered users' long-term interests captured by a multi-layer GRU.\nConsidering the four points above, we built the model ENIREC.

    "abstract": "We explore a novel method to perceive and manipulate 3D articulated objects\nthat generalizes to enable a robot to articulate unseen classes of objects. We\npropose a vision-based system that learns to predict the potential motions of\nthe parts of a variety of articulated objects to guide downstream motion\nplanning of the system to articulate the objects. To predict the object\nmotions, we train a neural network to output a dense vector field representing\nthe point-wise motion direction of the points in the point cloud under\narticulation. We then deploy an analytical motion planner based on this vector\nfield to achieve a policy that yields maximum articulation. We train the vision\nsystem entirely in simulation, and we demonstrate the capability of our system\nto generalize to unseen object instances and novel categories in both\nsimulation and the real world, deploying our policy on a Sawyer robot with no\nfinetuning. Results show that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance\nin both simulated and real-world experiments.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation for person re-identification (Person Re-ID) is\nthe task of transferring the learned knowledge on the labeled source domain to\nthe unlabeled target domain. Most of the recent papers that address this\nproblem adopt an offline training setting. More precisely, the training of the\nRe-ID model is done assuming that we have access to the complete training\ntarget domain data set. In this paper, we argue that the target domain\ngenerally consists of a stream of data in a practical real-world application,\nwhere data is continuously increasing from the different network's cameras. The\nRe-ID solutions are also constrained by confidentiality regulations stating\nthat the collected data can be stored for only a limited period, hence the\nmodel can no longer get access to previously seen target images. Therefore, we\npresent a new yet practical online setting for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\nfor person Re-ID with two main constraints: Online Adaptation and Privacy\nProtection. We then adapt and evaluate the state-of-the-art UDA algorithms on\nthis new online setting using the well-known Market-1501, Duke, and MSMT17\nbenchmarks.",

    "title": "Accelerating potential evaluation over unstructured meshes in two  dimensions",
    "abstract": "The accurate and efficient evaluation of potentials with singular or\nweakly-singular kernels is of great importance for the numerical solution of\npartial differential equations. When the integration domain of the potential is\nirregular and is discretized by an unstructured mesh, the function spaces of\nnear field and self-interactions are non-compact, and, thus, their computations\ncannot be easily accelerated. In this paper, we propose several novel and\ncomplementary techniques for accelerating the evaluation of potentials over\nunstructured meshes. Firstly, we observe that the standard approximation of the\nnear field by a ball or a triangle often leads to an over-estimated near field.\nWe rigorously characterize the geometry of the near field, and show that this\nanalysis can be used to reduce the number of near field interaction\ncomputations dramatically. Secondly, as the near field can be made arbitrarily\nsmall by increasing the order of the far field quadrature rule, the expensive\nnear field interaction computation can be efficiently offloaded onto the\nFMM-based far field interaction computation, which leverages the computational\nefficiency of highly optimized parallel FMM libraries. Finally, we observe that\nthe usual arrangement in which the interpolation nodes are placed on the same\nmesh over which the potential is integrated results in an artificially large\nnumber of near field interaction calculations, since the discretization points\ntend to cluster near the boundaries of mesh elements. We show that the use of a\nseparate staggered mesh for interpolation effectively reduces the cost of near\nfield and self-interaction computations. Besides these contributions, we\npresent a robust and extensible framework for the evaluation and interpolation\nof 2-D volume potentials over complicated geometries. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the techniques with several numerical experiments.",

    "abstract": "The rapid increase in the adoption of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices raises\ncritical privacy concerns as these devices can access a variety of sensitive\ndata. The current status quo of relying on manufacturers' cloud services to\nprocess this data is especially problematic since users cede control once their\ndata leaves their home. Multiple recent incidents further call into question if\nvendors can indeed be trusted with users' data. At the same time, users desire\ncompelling features supported by IoT devices and ML-based cloud inferences\nwhich compels them to subscribe to manufacturer-managed cloud services. An\nalternative to use a local in-home hub requires substantial hardware\ninvestment, management, and scalability limitations. This paper proposes\nSelf-Serviced IoT (SSIoT), a clean-slate approach of using a hybrid hub-cloud\nsetup to enable privacy-aware computation offload for IoT applications.\nUniquely, SSIoT enables opportunistic computation offload to public cloud\nproviders while still ensuring that the end-user retains complete end-to-end\ncontrol of their private data reducing the trust required from public cloud\nproviders. We show that SSIoT can leverage emerging function-as-a-service\ncomputation (e.g. AWS Lambda) to make these offloads cost-efficient, scalable\nand high performance as long as key limitations of being stateless, limited\nresources, and security isolation can be addressed. We build an end-to-end\nprototype of SSIoT and evaluate it using several micro-benchmarks and example\napplications representing real-world IoT use cases. Our results show that SSIoT\nis highly scalable, as compared to local-only approaches which struggle with as\nlittle as 2-4 apps in parallel. We also show that SSIoT is cost-efficient\n(operating a smart doorbell for $10 a year) at the cost of minimal additional\nlatency as compared to a local-only hub, even with a hardware ML accelerator.",

    "abstract": "Along with the popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, an\nincreasing number of backdoor injection attacks are designed to maliciously\nthreaten Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deployed in safety-critical systems.\nAlthough there exist various defense methods that can effectively erase\nbackdoor triggers from DNNs, they still greatly suffer from a non-negligible\nAttack Success Rate (ASR) as well as a major loss in benign accuracy. Inspired\nby the observation that a backdoored DNN will form new clusters in its feature\nspace for poisoned data, in this paper we propose a novel backdoor defense\nmethod named MCL based on model-contrastive learning. Specifically,\nmodel-contrastive learning to implement backdoor defense consists of two steps.\nFirst, we use the backdoor attack trigger synthesis technique to invert the\ntrigger. Next, the inversion trigger is used to construct poisoned data, so\nthat model-contrastive learning can be used, which makes the feature\nrepresentations of poisoned data close to that of the benign data while staying\naway from the original poisoned feature representations. Through extensive\nexperiments against five start-of-the-art attack methods on multiple benchmark\ndatasets, using only 5% of clean data, MCL is more effective for reducing\nbackdoor threats while maintaining higher accuracy of benign data. MCL can make\nthe benign accuracy degenerate by less than 1%.",

The Whittle--Mat\\'ern\nprior is characterized by a mean function and a covariance operator that is\ntaken as a negative power of an elliptic differential operator. This approach\nis flexible in that it can incorporate a wide range of prior information\nincluding non-stationary effects, but it is currently computationally\nadvantageous only for integer values of the exponent. In this paper, we derive\nan efficient method for handling all admissible noninteger values of the\nexponent. The method first discretizes the covariance operator using finite\nelements and quadrature, and uses preconditioned Krylov subspace solvers for\nshifted linear systems to efficiently apply the resulting covariance matrix to\na vector. This approach can be used for generating samples from the\ndistribution in two different ways: by solving a stochastic partial\ndifferential equation, and by using a truncated Karhunen-Lo\\`eve expansion. We\nshow how to incorporate this prior representation into the infinite-dimensional\nBayesian formulation, and show how to efficiently compute the maximum a\nposteriori estimate, and approximate the posterior variance. Although the focus\nof this paper is on Bayesian inverse problems, the techniques developed here\nare applicable to solving systems with fractional Laplacians and Gaussian\nrandom fields.

    "abstract": "Trajectory optimization offers mature tools for motion planning in\nhigh-dimensional spaces under dynamic constraints. However, when facing complex\nconfiguration spaces, cluttered with obstacles, roboticists typically fall back\nto sampling-based planners that struggle in very high dimensions and with\ncontinuous differential constraints. Indeed, obstacles are the source of many\ntextbook examples of problematic nonconvexities in the trajectory-optimization\nproblem. Here we show that convex optimization can, in fact, be used to\nreliably plan trajectories around obstacles. Specifically, we consider planning\nproblems with collision-avoidance constraints, as well as cost penalties and\nhard constraints on the shape, the duration, and the velocity of the\ntrajectory. Combining the properties of B\\'ezier curves with a\nrecently-proposed framework for finding shortest paths in Graphs of Convex Sets\n(GCS), we formulate the planning problem as a compact mixed-integer\noptimization. In stark contrast with existing mixed-integer planners, the\nconvex relaxation of our programs is very tight, and a cheap rounding of its\nsolution is typically sufficient to design globally-optimal trajectories. This\nreduces the mixed-integer program back to a simple convex optimization, and\nautomatically provides optimality bounds for the planned trajectories. We name\nthe proposed planner GCS, after its underlying optimization framework. We\ndemonstrate GCS in simulation on a variety of robotic platforms, including a\nquadrotor flying through buildings and a dual-arm manipulator (with fourteen\ndegrees of freedom) moving in a confined space. Using numerical experiments on\na seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator, we show that GCS can outperform\nwidely-used sampling-based planners by finding higher-quality trajectories in\nless time.",

    "title": "Static Analysis for AWS Best Practices in Python Code",
    "abstract": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud\nprovider, offering over 200 fully featured services, including compute,\ndatabase, storage, networking and content delivery, machine learning, Internet\nof Things and many others. AWS SDKs provide access to AWS services through API\nendpoints. However, incorrect use of these APIs can lead to code defects,\ncrashes, performance issues, and other problems.\nThis paper presents automated static analysis rules, developed in the context\nof a commercial service for detection of code defects and security\nvulnerabilities, to identify deviations from AWS best practices in Python\napplications that use the AWS SDK. Such applications use the AWS SDK for\nPython, called \"Boto3\", to access AWS cloud services. However, precise static\nanalysis of Python applications that use cloud SDKs requires robust type\ninference for inferring the types of cloud service clients. The dynamic style\nof Boto3 APIs poses unique challenges for type resolution, as does the\ninterprocedural style in which service clients are used in practice. In support\nof our best-practices goal, we present a layered strategy for type inference\nthat combines multiple type-resolution and tracking strategies in a staged\nmanner. From our experiments across >3,000 popular Python GitHub repos that\nmake use of the AWS SDK, our layered type inference system achieves 85%\nprecision and 100% recall in inferring Boto3 clients in Python client code.\nAdditionally, we present a representative sample of eight AWS best-practice\nrules that detect a wide range of issues including pagination, polling, and\nbatch operations. We have assessed the efficacy of these rules based on\nreal-world developer feedback. Developers have accepted more than 85% of the\nrecommendations made by five out of eight Python rules, and almost 83% of all\nrecommendations.",

Furthermore, there is no\nconsensus on how to construct and interpret a higher-order generalisation of\nmutual information (MI). In this manuscript, we show that a recently proposed\nmodel-free definition of higher-order interactions amongst binary variables\n(MFIs), like mutual information, is a M\\\"obius inversion on a Boolean algebra,\nbut of surprisal instead of entropy. This gives an information-theoretic\ninterpretation to the MFIs, and by extension to Ising interactions. We study\nthe dual objects to MI and MFIs on the order-reversed lattice, and find that\ndual MI is related to the previously studied differential mutual information,\nwhile dual interactions (outeractions) are interactions with respect to a\ndifferent background state. Unlike mutual information, in- and outeractions\nuniquely identify all six 2-input logic gates, the dy- and triadic\ndistributions, and different causal dynamics that are identical in terms of\ntheir Shannon-information content.",

    "abstract": "Automatic Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has attracted increasing\nattention in the last 20 years since facial expressions play a central role in\nhuman communication. Most FER methodologies utilize Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)\nthat are powerful tools when it comes to data analysis. However, despite their\npower, these networks are prone to overfitting, as they often tend to memorize\nthe training data. What is more, there are not currently a lot of in-the-wild\n(i.e. in unconstrained environment) large databases for FER. To alleviate this\nissue, a number of data augmentation techniques have been proposed. Data\naugmentation is a way to increase the diversity of available data by applying\nconstrained transformations on the original data. One such technique, which has\npositively contributed to various classification tasks, is Mixup. According to\nthis, a DNN is trained on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their\ncorresponding labels. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of Mixup for\nin-the-wild FER in which data have large variations in head poses, illumination\nconditions, backgrounds and contexts. We then propose a new data augmentation\nstrategy which is based on Mixup, called MixAugment. According to this, the\nnetwork is trained concurrently on a combination of virtual examples and real\nexamples; all these examples contribute to the overall loss function. We\nconduct an extensive experimental study that proves the effectiveness of\nMixAugment over Mixup and various state-of-the-art methods. We further\ninvestigate the combination of dropout with Mixup and MixAugment, as well as\nthe combination of other data augmentation techniques with MixAugment.",

The scheme can\npreserve a general polytropic equilibrium state and achieve total energy\nconservation up to machine precision with carefully designed spatial and\ntemporal discretizations.

One non-trivial challenge\nencountered in the procedure is the complexity of the equilibrium state, which\nis governed by the Lane-Emden equation. For total energy conservation, we\npresent second- and third-order RK time discretization, where different source\nterm approximations are introduced in each stage of the RK method to ensure the\nconservation of total energy. A carefully designed slope limiter for spherical\nsymmetry is also introduced to eliminate oscillations near discontinuities\nwhile maintaining the well-balanced and total-energy-conserving properties.\nExtensive numerical examples -- including a toy model of stellar core-collapse\nwith a phenomenological equation of state that results in core-bounce and shock\nformation -- are provided to demonstrate the desired properties of the proposed\nmethods, including the well-balanced property, high-order accuracy, shock\ncapturing capability, and total energy conservation.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an introspective deep metric learning (IDML) framework\nfor uncertainty-aware comparisons of images. Conventional deep metric learning\nmethods produce confident semantic distances between images regardless of the\nuncertainty level. However, we argue that a good similarity model should\nconsider the semantic discrepancies with caution to better deal with ambiguous\nimages for more robust training. To achieve this, we propose to represent an\nimage using not only a semantic embedding but also an accompanying uncertainty\nembedding, which describes the semantic characteristics and ambiguity of an\nimage, respectively. We further propose an introspective similarity metric to\nmake similarity judgments between images considering both their semantic\ndifferences and ambiguities. Our framework attains state-of-the-art performance\non the widely used CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products datasets\nfor image retrieval. We further evaluate our framework for image classification\non the ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, which shows that\nequipping existing data mixing methods with the proposed introspective metric\nconsistently achieves better results (e.g., +0.44 for CutMix on ImageNet-1K).\nCode is available at: https://github.com/wangck20/IDML.",

Particularly, we\npresent a differential chaos shift keying (DCSK)-based WPT architecture, that\nemploys an analog correlator at the receiver, in order to boost the energy\nharvesting (EH) performance. We take into account the nonlinearities of the EH\nprocess and derive closed-form analytical expressions for the harvested direct\ncurrent (DC) under a generalized Nakagami-m block fading model. We show that,\nin this framework, both the peak-to-average-power-ratio of the received signal\nand the harvested DC, depend on the parameters of the transmitted waveform.\nFurthermore, we investigate the case of deterministic unmodulated chaotic\nwaveforms and demonstrate that, in the absence of a correlator, modulation does\nnot affect the achieved harvested DC. On the other hand, it is shown that for\nscenarios with a correlator-aided receiver, DCSK significantly outperforms the\nunmodulated case. Based on this observation, we propose a novel DCSK-based\nsignal design, which further enhances the WPT capability of the proposed\narchitecture; corresponding analytical expressions for the harvested DC are\nalso derived. Our results demonstrate that the proposed architecture and the\nassociated signal design, can achieve significant EH gains in DCSK-based WPT\nsystems.

We derive a registration method that is fast, generic, fully\nautomatic, does not require any initialization and can naturally generate\nvisualizations aiding interpretability and explainability. Our approach is\nevaluated on a clinical dataset of paired MR volumes and ultrasound sequences.",

    "title": "Structure Learning in Graphical Models from Indirect Observations",
    "abstract": "This paper considers learning of the graphical structure of a $p$-dimensional\nrandom vector $X \\in R^p$ using both parametric and non-parametric methods.\nUnlike the previous works which observe $x$ directly, we consider the indirect\nobservation scenario in which samples $y$ are collected via a sensing matrix $A\n\\in R^{d\\times p}$, and corrupted with some additive noise $w$, i.e, $Y = AX +\nW$. For the parametric method, we assume $X$ to be Gaussian, i.e., $x\\in\nR^p\\sim N(\\mu, \\Sigma)$ and $\\Sigma \\in R^{p\\times p}$. For the first time, we\nshow that the correct graphical structure can be correctly recovered under the\nindefinite sensing system ($d < p$) using insufficient samples ($n < p$). In\nparticular, we show that for the exact recovery, we require dimension $d =\n\\Omega(p^{0.8})$ and sample number $n = \\Omega(p^{0.8}\\log^3 p)$. For the\nnonparametric method, we assume a nonparanormal distribution for $X$ rather\nthan Gaussian. Under mild conditions, we show that our graph-structure\nestimator can obtain the correct structure. We derive the minimum sample number\n$n$ and dimension $d$ as $n\\gtrsim (deg)^4 \\log^4 n$ and $d \\gtrsim p +\n(deg\\cdot\\log(d-p))^{\\beta/4}$, respectively, where deg is the maximum Markov\nblanket in the graphical model and $\\beta > 0$ is some fixed positive constant.\nAdditionally, we obtain a non-asymptotic uniform bound on the estimation error\nof the CDF of $X$ from indirect observations with inexact knowledge of the\nnoise distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this bound is derived for the\nfirst time and may serve as an independent interest. Numerical experiments on\nboth real-world and synthetic data are provided confirm the theoretical\nresults.",

    "abstract": "Traditional memory writing operations proceed one bit at a time, where e.g.\nan individual magnetic domain is force-flipped by a localized external field.\nOne way to increase material storage capacity would be to write several bits at\na time in the bulk of the material. However, the manipulation of bits is\ncommonly done through quasi-static operations. While simple to model, this\nmethod is known to reduce memory capacity. In this paper, we demonstrate how a\nreinforcement learning agent can exploit the dynamical response of a simple\nmulti-bit mechanical system to restore its memory to full capacity. To do so,\nwe introduce a model framework consisting of a chain of bi-stable springs,\nwhich is manipulated on one end by the external action of the agent. We show\nthat the agent manages to learn how to reach all available states for three\nsprings, even though some states are not reachable through adiabatic\nmanipulation, and that both the training speed and convergence within physical\nparameter space are improved using transfer learning techniques. Interestingly,\nthe agent also points to an optimal design of the system in terms of writing\ntime. In fact, it appears to learn how to take advantage of the underlying\nphysics: the control time exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the internal\ndissipation, reaching a minimum at a cross-over shown to verify a mechanically\nmotivated scaling relation.",

    "abstract": "Iterative methods play an important role in science and engineering\napplications, with uses ranging from linear system solvers in finite element\nmethods to optimization solvers in model predictive control. Recently, a new\ncomputational strategy for iterative methods called ARCHITECT was proposed by\nLi et al. in [1] that uses the redundant number representation to create\n\"stable digits\" in the Most-significant Digits (MSDs) of an iterate, allowing\nthe future iterations to assume the stable MSDs have not changed their value,\neliminating the need to recompute them. In this work, we present a theoretical\nanalysis of how these \"stable digits\" arise in iterative methods by showing\nthat a Fejer monotone sequence in the redundant number representation can\ndevelop stable MSDs in the elements of the sequence as the sequence grows in\nlength. This property of Fejer monotone sequences allows us to expand the class\nof iterative methods known to have MSD stability when using the redundant\nnumber representation to include any fixed-point iteration of a contractive\nLipschitz continuous function. We then show that this allows for the\ntheoretical guarantee of digit stability not just in the Jacobi method that was\npreviously analyzed by Li et al. in [2], but also in other commonly used\nmethods such as Newton's method.",

    "abstract": "The Li-ion battery is a complex physicochemical system that generally takes\napplied current as input and terminal voltage as output. The mappings from\ncurrent to voltage can be described by several kinds of models, such as\naccurate but inefficient physics-based models, and efficient but sometimes\ninaccurate equivalent circuit and black-box models. To realize accuracy and\nefficiency simultaneously in battery modeling, we propose to build a\ndata-driven surrogate for a battery system while incorporating the underlying\nphysics as constraints. In this work, we innovatively treat the functional\nmapping from current curve to terminal voltage as a composite of operators,\nwhich is approximated by the powerful deep operator network (DeepONet). Its\nlearning capability is firstly verified through a predictive test for Li-ion\nconcentration at two electrodes. In this experiment, the physics-informed\nDeepONet is found to be more robust than the purely data-driven DeepONet,\nespecially in temporal extrapolation scenarios. A composite surrogate is then\nconstructed for mapping current curve and solid diffusivity to terminal voltage\nwith three operator networks, in which two parallel physics-informed DeepONets\nare firstly used to predict Li-ion concentration at two electrodes, and then\nbased on their surface values, a DeepONet is built to give terminal voltage\npredictions. Since the surrogate is differentiable anywhere, it is endowed with\nthe ability to learn from data directly, which was validated by using terminal\nvoltage measurements to estimate input parameters. The proposed surrogate built\nupon operator networks possesses great potential to be applied in on-board\nscenarios, such as battery management system, since it integrates efficiency\nand accuracy by incorporating underlying physics, and also leaves an interface\nfor model refinement through a totally differentiable model structure.",

    "abstract": "Due to the sophisticated imaging process, an identical scene captured by\ndifferent cameras could exhibit distinct imaging patterns, introducing distinct\nproficiency among the super-resolution (SR) models trained on images from\ndifferent devices. In this paper, we investigate a novel and practical task\ncoded cross-device SR, which strives to adapt a real-world SR model trained on\nthe paired images captured by one camera to low-resolution (LR) images captured\nby arbitrary target devices. The proposed task is highly challenging due to the\nabsence of paired data from various imaging devices. To address this issue, we\npropose an unsupervised domain adaptation mechanism for real-world SR, named\nDual ADversarial Adaptation (DADA), which only requires LR images in the target\ndomain with available real paired data from a source camera. DADA employs the\nDomain-Invariant Attention (DIA) module to establish the basis of target model\ntraining even without HR supervision. Furthermore, the dual framework of DADA\nfacilitates an Inter-domain Adversarial Adaptation (InterAA) in one branch for\ntwo LR input images from two domains, and an Intra-domain Adversarial\nAdaptation (IntraAA) in two branches for an LR input image. InterAA and IntraAA\ntogether improve the model transferability from the source domain to the\ntarget. We empirically conduct experiments under six Real to Real adaptation\nsettings among three different cameras, and achieve superior performance\ncompared with existing state-of-the-art approaches. We also evaluate the\nproposed DADA to address the adaptation to the video camera, which presents a\npromising research topic to promote the wide applications of real-world\nsuper-resolution.

    "abstract": "Beamforming is a powerful tool designed to enhance speech signals from the\ndirection of a target source. Computing the beamforming filter requires\nestimating spatial covariance matrices (SCMs) of the source and noise signals.\nTime-frequency masks are often used to compute these SCMs. Most studies of\nmask-based beamforming have assumed that the sources do not move. However,\nsources often move in practice, which causes performance degradation. In this\npaper, we address the problem of mask-based beamforming for moving sources. We\nfirst review classical approaches to tracking a moving source, which perform\nonline or blockwise computation of the SCMs. We show that these approaches can\nbe interpreted as computing a sum of instantaneous SCMs weighted by attention\nweights. These weights indicate which time frames of the signal to consider in\nthe SCM computation. Online or blockwise computation assumes a heuristic and\ndeterministic way of computing these attention weights that, although simple,\nmay not result in optimal performance. We thus introduce a learning-based\nframework that computes optimal attention weights for beamforming. We achieve\nthis using a neural network implemented with self-attention layers. We show\nexperimentally that our proposed framework can greatly improve beamforming\nperformance in moving source situations while maintaining high performance in\nnon-moving situations, thus enabling the development of mask-based beamformers\nrobust to source movements.",

For\nthe automatic detection of ICMEs we propose a pipeline using a method that has\nrecently proven successful in medical image segmentation. Comparing it to an\nexisting method, we find that while achieving similar results, our model\noutperforms the baseline regarding training time by a factor of approximately\n20, thus making it more applicable for other datasets. The method has been\ntested on in situ data from the Wind spacecraft between 1997 and 2015 with a\nTrue Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.64. Out of the 640 ICMEs, 466 were detected\ncorrectly by our algorithm, producing a total of 254 False Positives.\nAdditionally, it produced reasonable results on datasets with fewer features\nand smaller training sets from Wind, STEREO-A and STEREO-B with True Skill\nStatistics of 0.56, 0.57 and 0.53, respectively. Our pipeline manages to find\nthe start of an ICME with a mean absolute error (MAE) of around 2 hours and 56\nminutes, and the end time with a MAE of 3 hours and 20 minutes. The relatively\nfast training allows straightforward tuning of hyperparameters and could\ntherefore easily be used to detect other structures and phenomena in solar wind\ndata, such as corotating interaction regions.",

In this paper, we propose to\noptimize the VVC complexity at intra-frame prediction, with a two-stage\nframework of deep feature fusion and probability estimation. At the first\nstage, we employ the deep convolutional network to extract the spatialtemporal\nneighboring coding features. Then we fuse all reference features obtained by\ndifferent convolutional kernels to determine an optimal intra coding depth. At\nthe second stage, we employ a probability-based model and the spatial-temporal\ncoherence to select the candidate partition modes within the optimal coding\ndepth. Finally, these selected depths and partitions are executed whilst\nunnecessary computations are excluded.

Most\nprior works usually perform the fusion task by means of multifarious\npixel-level priors. Yet the intrinsic effects of a large distribution gap\nbetween HS-MS data due to differences in the spatial and spectral resolution\nare less investigated. The gap might be caused by unknown sensor-specific\nproperties or highly-mixed spectral information within one pixel (due to low\nspatial resolution). To this end, we propose a subpixel-level HS\nsuper-resolution framework by devising a novel decoupled-and-coupled network,\ncalled DC-Net, to progressively fuse HS-MS information from the pixel- to\nsubpixel-level, from the image- to feature-level. As the name suggests, DC-Net\nfirst decouples the input into common (or cross-sensor) and sensor-specific\ncomponents to eliminate the gap between HS-MS images before further fusion, and\nthen fully blends them by a model-guided coupled spectral unmixing (CSU) net.\nMore significantly, we append a self-supervised learning module behind the CSU\nnet by guaranteeing the material consistency to enhance the detailed\nappearances of the restored HS product.

However, existing LL1-based HU\nalgorithms use a three-factor parameterization of the tensor (i.e., the\nhyperspectral image cube), which leads to a number of challenges including high\nper-iteration complexity, slow convergence, and difficulties in incorporating\nstructural prior information. This work puts forth an LL1 tensor\ndecomposition-based HU algorithm that uses a constrained two-factor\nre-parameterization of the tensor data. As a consequence, a two-block\nalternating gradient projection (GP)-based LL1 algorithm is proposed for HU.\nWith carefully designed projection solvers, the GP algorithm enjoys a\nrelatively low per-iteration complexity. Like in MF-based HU, the factors under\nour parameterization correspond to the endmembers and abundances.

However, our\nresults can apply to other applications of bandit algorithms where missing data\nis expected to occur. We assess the resulting operating characteristics,\nincluding the expected reward (i.e., allocation results). Different\nprobabilities of missingness in both arms are considered. The key finding of\nour work is that when using the simplest strategy of ignoring missing data, the\ncorresponding impact on the performance of multi-armed bandit strategies varies\naccording to their way of balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off.\nAlgorithms that are geared towards exploration continue to assign samples to\nthe arm with more missing responses, and this arm is perceived as the superior\narm by the algorithm. By contrast, algorithms that are geared towards\nexploitation would do the opposite and not assign samples to the arms with more\nmissing responses.

In addition, we analyzed the\ninfluence of different molecular fingerprints, and the effects of molecular\ngraphs and molecular fingerprints on the performance of the FP-GNN model.\nAnalysis of the anti-noise ability and interpretation ability also indicated\nthat FP-GNN was competitive in real-world situations.",

In addition, WKGM is flexible and thus can\nsynergistically combine various traditional k-space PI models, generating\nlearning-based priors to produce high-fidelity reconstructions.

For long-distance\ncommunication, the only viable approach is teleportation of quantum states,\nwhich requires a prior distribution of entangled pairs (EPs) of qubits.\nEstablishment of EPs across remote nodes can incur significant latency due to\nthe low probability of success of the underlying physical processes. To reduce\nEP generation latency, prior works have looked at selection of efficient\nentanglement-routing paths and simultaneous use of multiple such paths for EP\ngeneration. In this paper, we propose and investigate a complementary technique\nto reduce EP generation latency--to pre-distribute EPs over certain\n(pre-determined) pairs of network nodes; these pre-distributed EPs can then be\nused to generate EPs for the requested pairs, when needed, with lower\ngeneration latency. For such an pre-distribution approach to be most effective,\nwe need to address an optimization problem of selection of node-pairs where the\nEPs should be pre-distributed to minimize the generation latency of expected EP\nrequests, under a given cost constraint. In this paper, we appropriately\nformulate the above optimization problem and design two efficient algorithms,\none of which is a greedy approach based on an approximation algorithm for a\nspecial case.

However,\nmost of these methods represent low-rank prior by hand-crafted nuclear norm,\nwhich cannot accurately approximate the low-rank prior over the entire dataset\nthrough a fixed regularization parameter. In this paper, we propose a learned\nlow-rank method for dynamic MR imaging. In particular, we unrolled the\nsemi-quadratic splitting method (HQS) algorithm for the partially separable\n(PS) model to a network, in which the low-rank is adaptively characterized by a\nlearnable null-space transform.

The mathematical model of linear quantum control\nsystems is presented first, then some fundamental control-theoretic notions\nsuch as stability, controllability and observability are given, which are\nclosely related to several important problems in quantum information technology\nsuch as decoherence-free subsystems, quantum non-demolition variables, and\nback-action evasion measurements. After that, quantum Gaussian states are\nintroduced, in particular, an information-theoretic uncertainty relation is\npresented which often gives a better bound for mixed Gaussian states than the\nwell-known Heisenberg uncertainty relation. The quantum Kalman filter is\npresented for quantum linear systems, which is the quantum analogy of the\nKalman filter for classical (namely, non-quantum-mechanical) linear systems.\nThe quantum Kalman canonical decomposition for quantum linear systems is\nrecorded, and its application is illustrated by means of a recent experiment.\nAs single- and multi-photon states are useful resources in quantum information\ntechnology, the response of quantum systems to these types of input is\npresented. Finally, feedback control of quantum linear systems is briefly\nintroduced, and a recent experiment is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nquantum linear systems and networks theory.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, hyperspectral imaging is recognized as cornerstone remote sensing\ntechnology. The explosive growth in image data volume and instrument data\nrates, compete with limited on-board storage resources and downlink bandwidth,\nmaking hyperspectral image data compression a mission critical on-board\nprocessing task. The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)\nextended the previous issue of the CCSDS-123.0 Recommended Standard for multi-\nand hyperspectral image compression to provide with Near-Lossless compression\nfunctionality. A key feature of the CCSDS-123.0-B-2 is the improved Hybrid\nEntropy Coder, which at low bit rates, provides substantially better\ncompression performance than the Issue 1 entropy coders. In this paper, we\nintroduce a high-throughput hardware implementation of the CCSDS-123.0-B-2\nHybrid Entropy Coder. The introduced architecture exploits the systolic design\npattern to provide modularity and latency insensitivity in a deep and elastic\npipeline achieving a constant throughput of 1 sample/cycle with a small FPGA\nresource footprint. This architecture is described in portable VHDL RTL and is\nimplemented, validated and demonstrated on a commercially available Xilinx\nKCU105 development board hosting a Xilinx Kintex Ultrascale XCKU040 SRAM FPGA,\nand thus, is directly transferable to Xilinx Radiation Tolerant Kintex\nUltraScale XQRKU060 space-grade devices for space deployments. Moreover,\nstate-of-the-art SpaceFibre (ECSS-E-ST-50-11C) serial link interface and test\nequipment were used in the validation platform to emulate an on-board\ndeployment. The introduced CCSDS-123.0-B-2 Hybrid Entropy Encoder achieves a\nconstant throughput performance of 305 MSamples/s. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first published fully-compliant architecture and\nhigh-throughput implementation of the CCSDS-123.0-B-2 Hybrid Entropy Coder,\ntargeting space-grade FPGA technology.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning techniques have shown great potential in medical image\nprocessing, particularly through accurate and reliable image segmentation on\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans or computed tomography (CT) scans, which\nallow the localization and diagnosis of lesions. However, training these\nsegmentation models requires a large number of manually annotated pixel-level\nlabels, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, in contrast to\nimage-level labels that are easier to obtain. It is imperative to resolve this\nproblem through weakly-supervised semantic segmentation models using\nimage-level labels as supervision since it can significantly reduce human\nannotation efforts. Most of the advanced solutions exploit class activation\nmapping (CAM). However, the original CAMs rarely capture the precise boundaries\nof lesions. In this study, we propose the strategy of multi-scale inference to\nrefine CAMs by reducing the detail loss in single-scale reasoning. For\nsegmentation, we develop a novel model named Mixed-UNet, which has two parallel\nbranches in the decoding phase. The results can be obtained after fusing the\nextracted features from two branches. We evaluate the designed Mixed-UNet\nagainst several prevalent deep learning-based segmentation approaches on our\ndataset collected from the local hospital and public datasets. The validation\nresults demonstrate that our model surpasses available methods under the same\nsupervision level in the segmentation of various lesions from brain imaging.",

    "abstract": "Acute leukemia is a type of blood cancer with a high mortality rate. Current\ntherapeutic methods include bone marrow transplantation, supportive therapy,\nand chemotherapy. Although a satisfactory remission of the disease can be\nachieved, the risk of recurrence is still high. Therefore, novel treatments are\ndemanding. Chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) therapy has emerged as a\npromising approach to treat and cure acute leukemia. To harness the therapeutic\npotential of CAR-T cell therapy for blood diseases, reliable cell morphological\nidentification is crucial. Nevertheless, the identification of CAR-T cells is a\nbig challenge posed by their phenotypic similarity with other blood cells. To\naddress this substantial clinical challenge, herein we first construct a CAR-T\ndataset with 500 original microscopy images after staining. Following that, we\ncreate a novel integrated model called RCMNet (ResNet18 with CBAM and MHSA)\nthat combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer. The model\nshows 99.63% top-1 accuracy on the public dataset. Compared with previous\nreports, our model obtains satisfactory results for image classification.\nAlthough testing on the CAR-T cells dataset, a decent performance is observed,\nwhich is attributed to the limited size of the dataset. Transfer learning is\nadapted for RCMNet and a maximum of 83.36% accuracy has been achieved, which is\nhigher than other SOTA models. The study evaluates the effectiveness of RCMNet\non a big public dataset and translates it to a clinical dataset for diagnostic\napplications.",

We find a lack of\nresearch on the transaction aspects that closely characterize user behavior.\nSecond, we apply Shannon entropy in information theory to propose a\ndecentralization index for blockchain transactions.

Third, we apply our index to empirically\nanalyze the dynamics of DeFi token transfers.

Comparison of DeFi applications shows that exchange and\nlending are more decentralized than payment and derivatives. We also discover\nthat a greater return of ether, the native coin of the Ethereum blockchain,\npredicts a greater decentralization level in stablecoin transfer that includes\nether as collateral.

Our experimental results demonstrate that these added text\nembeddings improve the overall performance of the model compared to\nstate-of-the-art segmentation methods. We explore four different datasets and\nprovide insights for size-specific improvements. Our proposed text-guided\nattention network (TGANet) can generalize well to variable-sized polyps in\ndifferent datasets.",

    "title": "Site Generalization: Stroke Lesion Segmentation on Magnetic Resonance  Images from Unseen Sites",
    "abstract": "There are considerable interests in automatic stroke lesion segmentation on\nmagnetic resonance (MR) images in the medical imaging field, as strokes are the\nmain cause of various cerebrovascular diseases. Although deep learning-based\nmodels have been proposed for this task, generalizing these models to unseen\nsites is difficult due to not only the large intersite discrepancy among\ndifferent scanners, imaging protocols, and populations but also the variations\nin stroke lesion shape, size, and location. Thus, we propose a U-net--based\nsegmentation network termed SG-Net to improve unseen site generalization for\nstroke lesion segmentation on MR images. Specifically, we first propose masked\nadaptive instance normalization (MAIN) to minimize intersite discrepancies,\nstandardizing input MR images from different sites into a site-unrelated style\nby dynamically learning affine parameters from the input. Then, we leverage a\ngradient reversal layer to force the U-net encoder to learn site-invariant\nrepresentation, which further improves the model generalization in conjunction\nwith MAIN. Finally, inspired by the \"pseudosymmetry\" of the human brain, we\nintroduce a simple, yet effective data augmentation technique that can be\nembedded within SG-Net to double the sample size while halving memory\nconsumption. As a result, stroke lesions from the whole brain can be easily\nidentified within a hemisphere, improving the simplicity of training.\nExperimental results on the benchmark Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After\nStroke (ATLAS) dataset, which includes MR images from 9 different sites,\ndemonstrate that under the \"leave-one-site-out\" setting, the proposed SG-Net\nsubstantially outperforms recently published methods in terms of quantitative\nmetrics and qualitative comparisons.",

    "abstract": "The origin of the quiet Sun magnetism is under debate. Investigating the\nsolar cycle variation observationally in more detail can give us clues about\nhow to resolve the controversies. We investigate the solar cycle variation of\nthe most magnetically quiet regions and their surface gravity oscillation\n($f$-) mode integrated energy ($E_f$). We use 12 years of HMI data and apply a\nstringent selection criteria, based on spatial and temporal quietness, to avoid\nany influence of active regions (ARs). We develop an automated high-throughput\npipeline to go through all available magnetogram data and to compute $E_f$ for\nthe selected quiet regions. We observe a clear solar cycle dependence of the\nmagnetic field strength in the most quiet regions containing several\nsupergranular cells. For patch sizes smaller than a supergranular cell, no\nsignificant cycle dependence is detected. The $E_f$ at the supergranular scale\nis not constant over time. During the late ascending phase of Cycle 24 (SC24,\n2011-2012), it is roughly constant, but starts diminishing in 2013, as the\nmaximum of SC24 is approached. This trend continues until mid-2017, when hints\nof strengthening at higher southern latitudes are seen. Slow strengthening\ncontinues, stronger at higher latitudes than at the equatorial regions, but\n$E_f$ never returns back to the values seen in 2011-2012. Also, the\nstrengthening trend continues past the solar minimum, to the years when SC25 is\nalready clearly ascending. Hence the $E_f$ behavior is not in phase with the\nsolar cycle. The anticorrelation of $E_f$ with the solar cycle in gross terms\nis expected, but the phase shift of several years indicates a connection to the\npoloidal large-scale magnetic field component rather than the toroidal one.\nCalibrating AR signals with the QS $E_f$ does not reveal significant\nenhancement of the $f$-mode prior to AR emergence.",

Some questions naturally arise that whether a TTS system can\nachieve human-level quality, how to define/judge human-level quality and how to\nachieve it. In this paper, we answer these questions by first defining\nhuman-level quality based on statistical significance of measurement and\ndescribing the guidelines to judge it, and then proposing a TTS system called\nNaturalSpeech that achieves human-level quality on a benchmark dataset.\nSpecifically, we leverage a variational autoencoder (VAE) for end-to-end text\nto waveform generation, with several key designs to enhance the capacity of\nprior from text and reduce the complexity of posterior from speech, including\nphoneme pre-training, differentiable duration modeling, bidirectional\nprior/posterior modeling, and memory mechanism in VAE. Experiment evaluations\non popular LJSpeech dataset show that our proposed NaturalSpeech achieves -0.01\nCMOS (comparative mean opinion score) to human recordings on sentence level,\nwith Wilcoxon signed rank test at p-level p>>0.05, which demonstrates no\nstatistically significant difference from human recordings for the first time\non this dataset.",

Strong speech enhancement front-ends are\navailable, however, they typically require that the ASR model is retrained to\ncope with the processing artifacts. In this paper we explore a speaker\nreinforcement strategy for improving recognition performance without retraining\nthe acoustic model (AM). This is achieved by remixing the enhanced signal with\nthe unprocessed input to alleviate the processing artifacts. We evaluate the\nproposed approach using a DNN speaker extraction based speech denoiser trained\nwith a perceptually motivated loss function. Results show that (without AM\nretraining) our method yields about 23% and 25% relative accuracy gains\ncompared with the unprocessed for the monoaural simulated and real CHiME-4\nevaluation sets, respectively, and outperforms a state-of-the-art reference\nmethod.",

However, we find that these\nnetworks can only utilize a limited spatial range of input information through\nattribution analysis.

In order to activate more input\npixels for reconstruction, we propose a novel Hybrid Attention Transformer\n(HAT). It combines channel attention and self-attention schemes, thus making\nuse of their complementary advantages. Moreover, to better aggregate the\ncross-window information, we introduce an overlapping cross-attention module to\nenhance the interaction between neighboring window features. In the training\nstage, we additionally propose a same-task pre-training strategy to bring\nfurther improvement. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the\nproposed modules, and the overall method significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods by more than 1dB.
