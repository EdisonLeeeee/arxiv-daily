    "abstract": "Human collaboration with systems within the Computational Creativity (CC)\nfield is often restricted to shallow interactions, where the creative\nprocesses, of systems and humans alike, are carried out in isolation, without\nany (or little) intervention from the user, and without any discussion about\nhow the unfolding decisions are taking place. Fruitful co-creation requires a\nsustained ongoing interaction that can include discussions of ideas,\ncomparisons to previous/other works, incremental improvements and revisions,\netc. For these interactions, communication is an intrinsic factor. This means\ngiving a voice to CC systems and enabling two-way communication channels\nbetween them and their users so that they can: explain their processes and\ndecisions, support their ideas so that these are given serious consideration by\ntheir creative collaborators, and learn from these discussions to further\nimprove their creative processes. For this, we propose a set of design\nprinciples for CC systems that aim at supporting greater co-creation and\ncollaboration with their human collaborators.",

    "abstract": "While multi-class 3D detectors are needed in many robotics applications,\ntraining them with fully labeled datasets can be expensive in labeling cost. An\nalternative approach is to have targeted single-class labels on disjoint data\nsamples. In this paper, we are interested in training a multi-class 3D object\ndetection model, while using these single-class labeled data. We begin by\ndetailing the unique stance of our \"Single-Class Supervision\" (SCS) setting\nwith respect to related concepts such as partial supervision and semi\nsupervision. Then, based on the case study of training the multi-class version\nof Range Sparse Net (RSN), we adapt a spectrum of algorithms -- from supervised\nlearning to pseudo-labeling -- to fully exploit the properties of our SCS\nsetting, and perform extensive ablation studies to identify the most effective\nalgorithm and practice. Empirical experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show\nthat proper training under SCS can approach or match full supervision training\nwhile saving labeling costs.",

    "abstract": "Soil consolidation is closely related to seepage, stability, and settlement\nof geotechnical buildings and foundations, and directly affects the use and\nsafety of superstructures. Nowadays, the unidirectional consolidation theory of\nsoils is widely used in certain conditions and approximate calculations. The\nmulti-directional theory of soil consolidation is more reasonable than the\nunidirectional theory in practical applications, but it is much more\ncomplicated in terms of index determination and solution. To address the above\nproblem, in this paper, we propose a deep learning method using\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINN) to predict the excess pore water\npressure of two-dimensional soil consolidation. In the proposed method, (1) a\nfully connected neural network is constructed, (2) the computational domain,\npartial differential equation (PDE), and constraints are defined to generate\ndata for model training, and (3) the PDE of two-dimensional soil consolidation\nand the model of the neural network is connected to reduce the loss of the\nmodel. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparison with\nthe numerical solution of PDE for two-dimensional consolidation. Using this\nmethod, the excess pore water pressure could be predicted simply and\nefficiently. In addition, the method was applied to predict the soil excess\npore water pressure in the foundation in a real case at Tianjin port, China.\nThe proposed deep learning approach can be used to investigate the large and\ncomplex multi-directional soil consolidation.",

Low-level tasks allow for robust quantitative\nevaluations, but are not indicative of the complex usage of a visualization.\nOpen-ended tasks, while excellent for insight-based evaluations, are typically\nunstructured and require time-consuming interviews. Bridging this gap, we\npropose inferential tasks: a complementary task category based on inferential\nlearning in psychology.

We first contribute a new\nchallenge benchmark for comparing humans and distributional large language\nmodels (LLMs). Our benchmark contains two problem-solving domains (planning and\nexplanation generation) and is designed to require generalization to new,\nout-of-distribution problems expressed in language. We find that humans are far\nmore robust than LLMs on this benchmark. Next, we propose a hybrid\nParse-and-Solve model, which augments distributional LLMs with a structured\nsymbolic reasoning module.

We revive classical space-time patches-nearest-neighbors\napproaches and adapt them to a scalable unconditional generative model, without\nany learning. This simple baseline surprisingly outperforms single-video GANs\nin visual quality and realism (confirmed by quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations), and is disproportionately faster (runtime reduced from several\ndays to seconds). Our approach is easily scaled to Full-HD videos. We also use\nthe same framework to demonstrate video analogies and spatio-temporal\nretargeting.

Thus, we aim to automate coding of human behavior for\nuse in psychotherapy and research with the help of artificial intelligence (AI)\ntools. Here, we present an analysis plan. Methods: Videos of a gold-standard\nsemi-structured diagnostic interview of 25 youth with obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder (OCD) and 12 youth without a psychiatric diagnosis (no-OCD) will be\nanalyzed. Youth were between 8 and 17 years old. Features from the videos will\nbe extracted and used to compute ratings of behavior, which will be compared to\nratings of behavior produced by mental health professionals trained to use a\nspecific behavioral coding manual. We will test the effect of OCD diagnosis on\nthe computationally-derived behavior ratings using multivariate analysis of\nvariance (MANOVA). Using the generated features, a binary classification model\nwill be built and used to classify OCD/no-OCD classes. Discussion: Here, we\npresent a pre-defined plan for how data will be pre-processed, analyzed and\npresented in the publication of results and their interpretation. A challenge\nfor the proposed study is that the AI approach will attempt to derive\nbehavioral ratings based solely on vision, whereas humans use visual,\nparalinguistic and linguistic cues to rate behavior. Another challenge will be\nusing machine learning models for body and facial movement detection trained\nprimarily on adults and not on children. If the AI tools show promising\nresults, this pre-registered analysis plan may help reduce interpretation bias.\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov - H-18010607",

Although typically intended to elicit humour, they have been\nincreasingly used to spread hatred, trolling, and cyberbullying, as well as to\ntarget specific individuals, communities, or society on political,\nsocio-cultural, and psychological grounds. While previous work has focused on\ndetecting harmful, hateful, and offensive memes, identifying whom they attack\nremains a challenging and underexplored area. Here we aim to bridge this gap.\nIn particular, we create a dataset where we annotate each meme with its\nvictim(s) such as the name of the targeted person(s), organization(s), and\ncommunity(ies). We then propose DISARM (Detecting vIctimS targeted by hARmful\nMemes), a framework that uses named entity recognition and person\nidentification to detect all entities a meme is referring to, and then,\nincorporates a novel contextualized multimodal deep neural network to classify\nwhether the meme intends to harm these entities. We perform several systematic\nexperiments on three test setups, corresponding to entities that are (a) all\nseen while training, (b) not seen as a harmful target on training, and (c) not\nseen at all on training. The evaluation results show that DISARM significantly\noutperforms ten unimodal and multimodal systems. Finally, we show that DISARM\nis interpretable and comparatively more generalizable and that it can reduce\nthe relative error rate for harmful target identification by up to 9 points\nabsolute over several strong multimodal rivals.",

    "abstract": "The majority of traditional text-to-video retrieval systems operate in static\nenvironments, i.e., there is no interaction between the user and the agent\nbeyond the initial textual query provided by the user. This can be suboptimal\nif the initial query has ambiguities, which would lead to many falsely\nretrieved videos. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework for\nVideo Retrieval using Dialog (ViReD), which enables the user to interact with\nan AI agent via multiple rounds of dialog. The key contribution of our\nframework is a novel multimodal question generator that learns to ask questions\nthat maximize the subsequent video retrieval performance. Our multimodal\nquestion generator uses (i) the video candidates retrieved during the last\nround of interaction with the user and (ii) the text-based dialog history\ndocumenting all previous interactions, to generate questions that incorporate\nboth visual and linguistic cues relevant to video retrieval. Furthermore, to\ngenerate maximally informative questions, we propose an Information-Guided\nSupervision (IGS), which guides the question generator to ask questions that\nwould boost subsequent video retrieval accuracy. We validate the effectiveness\nof our interactive ViReD framework on the AVSD dataset, showing that our\ninteractive method performs significantly better than traditional\nnon-interactive video retrieval systems.

    "title": "Visualization Guidelines for Model Performance Communication Between  Data Scientists and Subject Matter Experts",
    "abstract": "Presenting the complexities of a model's performance is a communication\nbottleneck that threatens collaborations between data scientists and subject\nmatter experts. Accuracy and error metrics alone fail to tell the whole story\nof a model - its risks, strengths, and limitations - making it difficult for\nsubject matter experts to feel confident in deciding to use a model. As a\nresult, models may fail in unexpected ways if their weaknesses are not clearly\nunderstood. Alternatively, models may go unused, as subject matter experts\ndisregard poorly presented models in favor of familiar, yet arguably\nsubstandard methods. In this paper, we propose effective use of visualization\nas a medium for communication between data scientists and subject matter\nexperts. Our research addresses the gap between common practices in model\nperformance communication and the understanding of subject matter experts and\ndecision makers. We derive a set of communication guidelines and recommended\nvisualizations for communicating model performance based on interviews of both\ndata scientists and subject matter experts at the same organization. We conduct\na follow-up study with subject matter experts to evaluate the efficacy of our\nguidelines in presentations of model performance with and without our\nrecommendations. We find that our proposed guidelines made subject matter\nexperts more aware of the tradeoffs of the presented model. Participants\nrealized that current communication methods left them without a robust\nunderstanding of the model's performance, potentially giving them misplaced\nconfidence in the use of the model.",

    "abstract": "As the most significant data source in smart mobility systems, GPS\ntrajectories can help identify user travel mode. However, these GPS datasets\nmay contain users' private information (e.g., home location), preventing many\nusers from sharing their private information with a third party. Hence,\nidentifying travel modes while protecting users' privacy is a significant\nissue. To address this challenge, we use federated learning (FL), a\nprivacy-preserving machine learning technique that aims at collaboratively\ntraining a robust global model by accessing users' locally trained models but\nnot their raw data. Specifically, we designed a novel ensemble-based Federated\nDeep Neural Network (eFedDNN). The ensemble method combines the outputs of the\ndifferent models learned via FL by the users and shows an accuracy that\nsurpasses comparable models reported in the literature. Extensive experimental\nstudies on a real-world open-access dataset from Montreal demonstrate that the\nproposed inference model can achieve accurate identification of users' mode of\ntravel without compromising privacy.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical assemblies can exhibit complex relative motions, during which\ncollisions between moving parts and their surroundings must be avoided. To\ndefine feasible design spaces for each part's shape, \"maximal\" collision-free\npointsets can be computed using configuration space modeling techniques such as\nMinkowski operations and sweep/unsweep. For example, for a pair of parts\nundergoing a given relative motion, to make the problem well-posed, the\ngeometry of one part (chosen arbitrarily) must be fixed to compute the maximal\nshape of the other part by an unsweep operation. Making such arbitrary choices\nin a multi-component assembly can place unnecessary restrictions on the design\nspace. A broader family of collision-free pairs of parts can be explored, if\nfixing the geometry of a component is not required. In this paper, we formalize\nthis family of collision-free shapes and introduce a generic method for\ngenerating a broad subset of them. Our procedure, which is an extension of the\nunsweep, allows for co-generation of a pair of geometries which are modified\nincrementally and simultaneously to avoid collision. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness and scalability of our procedure in both 2D and 3D by generating\na variety of collision-free shapes. Notably, we show that our approach can\nautomatically generate freeform cam and follower profiles, gear teeth, and\nscrew threads, starting from colliding blocks of materials, solely from a\nspecification of relative motion and without the use of any feature-informed\nheuristics. Moreover, our approach provides continuous measures of collision\nthat can be incorporated into standard gradient-descent design optimization,\nallowing for simultaneous collision-free and physics-informed co-design of\nmechanical parts for assembly.",

Another alternative is to learn these policies with no\nsupervision via deep reinforcement learning, however, these algorithms require\na large amount of computing time to perform well on complex tasks with\nhigh-dimensional state and action spaces, such as those found in StarCraft II.\nAutomatic curriculum learning is a recent mechanism comprised of techniques\ndesigned to speed up deep reinforcement learning by adjusting the difficulty of\nthe current task to be solved according to the agent's current capabilities.\nDesigning a proper curriculum, however, can be challenging for sufficiently\ncomplex tasks, and thus we leverage human demonstrations as a way to guide\nagent exploration during training.

However, current\napproaches to tackle this problem are mostly restricted to simple systems. In\nthis paper, we propose a new method to combine model-based safety with\nmodel-free reinforcement learning by explicitly finding a low-dimensional model\nof the system controlled by a RL policy and applying stability and safety\nguarantees on that simple model. We use a complex bipedal robot Cassie, which\nis a high dimensional nonlinear system with hybrid dynamics and underactuation,\nand its RL-based walking controller as an example. We show that a\nlow-dimensional dynamical model is sufficient to capture the dynamics of the\nclosed-loop system. We demonstrate that this model is linear, asymptotically\nstable, and is decoupled across control input in all dimensions. We further\nexemplify that such linearity exists even when using different RL control\npolicies. Such results point out an interesting direction to understand the\nrelationship between RL and optimal control: whether RL tends to linearize the\nnonlinear system during training in some cases. Furthermore, we illustrate that\nthe found linear model is able to provide guarantees by safety-critical optimal\ncontrol framework, e.g., Model Predictive Control with Control Barrier\nFunctions, on an example of autonomous navigation using Cassie while taking\nadvantage of the agility provided by the RL-based controller.",

    "abstract": "The extreme multi-label classification (XMC) task aims at tagging content\nwith a subset of labels from an extremely large label set. The label vocabulary\nis typically defined in advance by domain experts and assumed to capture all\nnecessary tags. However in real world scenarios this label set, although large,\nis often incomplete and experts frequently need to refine it. To develop\nsystems that simplify this process, we introduce the task of open vocabulary\nXMC (OXMC): given a piece of content, predict a set of labels, some of which\nmay be outside of the known tag set. Hence, in addition to not having training\ndata for some labels - as is the case in zero-shot classification - models need\nto invent some labels on-the-fly. We propose GROOV, a fine-tuned seq2seq model\nfor OXMC that generates the set of labels as a flat sequence and is trained\nusing a novel loss independent of predicted label order. We show the efficacy\nof the approach, experimenting with popular XMC datasets for which GROOV is\nable to predict meaningful labels outside the given vocabulary while performing\non par with state-of-the-art solutions for known labels.",

So machine learning tasks need to be spread across\nmultiple servers, turning the centralized machine learning into a distributed\none. However, privacy remains an unsolved problem in distributed machine\nlearning. Multi-key homomorphic encryption is one of the suitable candidates to\nsolve the problem. However, the most recent result of the Multi-key homomorphic\nencryption scheme (MKTFHE) only supports the NAND gate. Although it is Turing\ncomplete, it requires efficient encapsulation of the NAND gate to further\nsupport mathematical calculation. This paper designs and implements a series of\noperations on positive and negative integers accurately. First, we design basic\nbootstrapped gates with the same efficiency as that of the NAND gate. Second,\nwe construct practical $k$-bit complement mathematical operators based on our\nbasic binary bootstrapped gates. The constructed created can perform addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication, and division on both positive and negative\nintegers. Finally, we demonstrated the generality of the designed operators by\nachieving a distributed privacy-preserving machine learning algorithm, i.e.\nlinear regression with two different solutions.

The lack\nof systematic description and modeling support for these sparse tensor\naccelerators impedes hardware designers from efficient and effective design\nspace exploration. This paper first presents a unified taxonomy to\nsystematically describe the diverse sparse tensor accelerator design space.\nBased on the proposed taxonomy, it then introduces Sparseloop, the first fast,\naccurate, and flexible analytical modeling framework to enable early-stage\nevaluation and exploration of sparse tensor accelerators. Sparseloop\ncomprehends a large set of architecture specifications, including various\ndataflows and sparse acceleration features (e.g., elimination of zero-based\ncompute). Using these specifications, Sparseloop evaluates a design's\nprocessing speed and energy efficiency while accounting for data movement and\ncompute incurred by the employed dataflow as well as the savings and overhead\nintroduced by the sparse acceleration features using stochastic tensor density\nmodels. Across representative accelerators and workloads, Sparseloop achieves\nover 2000 times faster modeling speed than cycle-level simulations, maintains\nrelative performance trends, and achieves 0.1% to 8% average error.

Objective: We wanted to know the key challenges that make RC\nhandling difficult, how these impact the emotions of software practitioners,\nwhat influences their RC handling, and how RC handling can be made less\nemotionally challenging. Method: We followed a mixed-methods approach. We\nconducted two survey studies, with 40 participants and 201 participants\nrespectively. The presentation of key quantitative data was followed by\ndescriptive statistical analysis, and the qualitative data was analysed using\nStrauss-Corbinian Grounded Theory, and Socio-Technical Grounded Theory analysis\ntechniques. Findings:We found (1) several key factors that make RC handling an\nemotional challenge, (2) varying emotions that practitioners feel when it is\nchallenging to handle RCs, (3) how stakeholders, including practitioners\nthemselves, peers, managers and customers, influence the RC handling and how\npractitioners feel due to the stakeholder influence, and (4) practices that can\nbe used to better handle RCs. Conclusion: Some challenges are technical and\nsome are social which also belong to aspects of agile practice, emotional\nintelligence, and cognitive intelligence. Therefore, to better handle RCs with\npositive emotions in socio-technical environments, agility, emotional\nintelligence, and cognitive intelligence need to cooperate with each other.",

This enables efficient inference but necessitates re-computation of\nthe backbone whenever a new source domain is added. Moreover, state-of-the-art\nmethods derive their universal model from a collection of backbones -- normally\none for each source domain -- and the backbones may be constrained to have the\nsame architecture as the universal model. We propose a CDFSML method that is\ninspired by the classic stacking approach to meta learning. It imposes no\nconstraints on the backbones' architecture or feature shape and does not incur\nthe computational overhead of (re-)computing a universal model. Given a\ntarget-domain task, it fine-tunes each backbone independently, uses\ncross-validation to extract meta training data from the task's instance-scarce\nsupport set, and learns a simple linear meta classifier from this data.

This method achieves lexical enhancement by constructing a flat lattice,\nwhich mitigates the difficulties posed by blurred word boundaries and the lack\nof word semantics. To this end, FLAT uses the position information of the\nstarting and ending characters to connect the matching words. However, this\nmethod is likely to match more words when dealing with long texts, resulting in\nvery long input sequences. Therefore, it increases the memory used by\nself-attention and computational costs. To deal with this issue, we advocate a\nnovel lexical enhancement method, InterFormer, that effectively reduces the\namount of computational and memory costs by constructing the non-flat-lattice.\nFurthermore, we implement a complete model, namely NFLAT, for the Chinese NER\ntask. NFLAT decouples lexicon fusion and context feature encoding. Compared\nwith FLAT, it reduces unnecessary attention calculations in \"word-character\"\nand \"word-word\". This reduces the memory usage by about 50\\% and can use more\nextensive lexicons or higher batches for network training.

In\nthis paper, we fill this gap by presenting a human-annotated explainable CAusal\nREasoning dataset (e-CARE), which contains over 21K causal reasoning questions,\ntogether with natural language formed explanations of the causal questions.\nExperimental results show that generating valid explanations for causal facts\nstill remains especially challenging for the state-of-the-art models, and the\nexplanation information can be helpful for promoting the accuracy and stability\nof causal reasoning models.",

    "abstract": "The polar receiver architecture is a receiver design that captures the\nenvelope and phase information of the signal rather than its in-phase and\nquadrature components. Several studies have demonstrated the robustness of\npolar receivers to phase noise and other nonlinearities. Yet, the\ninformation-theoretic limits of polar receivers with finite-precision\nquantizers have not been investigated in the literature. The main contribution\nof this work is to identify the optimal signaling strategy for the additive\nwhite Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with polar quantization at the output. More\nprecisely, we show that the capacity-achieving modulation scheme has an\namplitude phase shift keying (APSK) structure. Using this result, the capacity\nof the AWGN channel with polar quantization at the output is established by\nnumerically optimizing the probability mass function of the amplitude. The\ncapacity of the polar-quantized AWGN channel with $b_1$-bit phase quantizer and\noptimized single-bit magnitude quantizer is also presented. Our numerical\nfindings suggest the existence of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) thresholds, above\nwhich the number of amplitude levels of the optimal APSK scheme and their\nrespective probabilities change abruptly. Moreover, the manner in which the\ncapacity-achieving input evolves with increasing SNR depends on the number of\nphase quantization bits.",

Especially, with the help of deep neural\nnetworks, great progress has been achieved so far. However, it remains less\ninvestigated on BIQA for night-time images (NTIs) which usually suffer from\ncomplicated authentic distortions such as reduced visibility, low contrast,\nadditive noises, and color distortions. These diverse authentic degradations\nparticularly challenges the design of effective deep neural network for blind\nNTI quality evaluation (NTIQE). In this paper, we propose a novel deep\ndecomposition and bilinear pooling network (DDB-Net) to better address this\nissue. The DDB-Net contains three modules, i.e., an image decomposition module,\na feature encoding module, and a bilinear pooling module. The image\ndecomposition module is inspired by the Retinex theory and involves decoupling\nthe input NTI into an illumination layer component responsible for illumination\ninformation and a reflectance layer component responsible for content\ninformation. Then, the feature encoding module involves learning multi-scale\nfeature representations of degradations that are rooted in the two decoupled\ncomponents separately. Finally, by modeling illumination-related and\ncontent-related degradations as two-factor variations, the two multi-scale\nfeature sets are bilinearly pooled and concatenated together to form a unified\nrepresentation for quality prediction. The superiority of the proposed DDB-Net\nis well validated by extensive experiments on two publicly available night-time\nimage databases.",

In this paper, Metropolis-Hastings Random\nWalk (MHRW) and Random Walk with Jumps (RWwJ) sampling strategies are\nintroduced, including the procedure of collecting nodes, the underlying\nmathematical theory, and corresponding estimators. We compared our methods and\nexisting research outcomes and found that MHRW performs better when estimating\ndegree distribution (61% less error than RWwJ) and graph order (0.69% less\nerror than RWwJ), while RWwJ estimates follower and following ratio average and\nmutual relationship proportion in adjacent relationship with better results,\nwith 13% less error and 6% less error than MHRW. We analyze the reasons for the\noutcomes and give possible future work directions.",

    "abstract": "The goal of building intelligent dialogue systems has largely been separately\npursued under two motives: task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, and\nopen-domain systems for chit-chat (CC). Although previous TOD dialogue systems\nwork well in the testing sets of benchmarks, they would lead to undesirable\nfailure when being exposed to natural scenarios in practice, where user\nutterances can be of high motive-diversity that fusing both TOD and CC in\nmulti-turn interaction. Since an industrial TOD system should be able to\nconverse with the user between TOD and CC motives, constructing a fuse-motive\ndialogue dataset that contains both TOD or CC is important. Most prior work\nrelies on crowd workers to collect and annotate large scale dataset and is\nrestricted to English language setting. Our work, on the contrary, addresses\nthis problem in a more effective way and releases a multi-turn dialogues\ndataset called CCET (Chinese Chat-Enhanced-Task).

Indeed, the effectiveness of PRF methods may well depend on the\nquality of the feedback signal and thus on the effectiveness of the first-stage\nranker. This aspect however has received little attention before.\nIn this paper we control the quality of the feedback signal and measure its\nimpact on a range of PRF methods, including traditional bag-of-words methods\n(Rocchio), and dense vector-based methods (learnt and not learnt). Our results\nshow the important role the quality of the feedback signal plays on the\neffectiveness of PRF methods. Importantly, and surprisingly, our analysis\nreveals that not all PRF methods are the same when dealing with feedback\nsignals of varying quality.

To this end, we build a new EM corpus and\nre-construct EM benchmarks to challenge critical assumptions implicit in the\nprevious benchmark construction process by step-wisely changing the restricted\nentities, balanced labels, and single-modal records in previous benchmarks into\nopen entities, imbalanced labels, and multimodal records in an open\nenvironment.

While\nresearch is being done in English to quantify and mitigate bias, debiasing\nmethods in Indic Languages are either relatively nascent or absent for some\nIndic languages altogether. Most Indic languages are gendered, i.e., each noun\nis assigned a gender according to each language's grammar rules. As a\nconsequence, evaluation differs from what is done in English. This paper\nevaluates the gender stereotypes in Hindi and Marathi languages. The\nmethodologies will differ from the ones in the English language because there\nare masculine and feminine counterparts in the case of some words.

    "abstract": "NER has been traditionally formulated as a sequence labeling task. However,\nthere has been recent trend in posing NER as a machine reading comprehension\ntask (Wang et al., 2020; Mengge et al., 2020), where entity name (or other\ninformation) is considered as a question, text as the context and entity value\nin text as answer snippet. These works consider MRC based on a single question\n(entity) at a time. We propose posing NER as a multi-question MRC task, where\nmultiple questions (one question per entity) are considered at the same time\nfor a single text. We propose a novel BERT-based multi-question MRC (NER-MQMRC)\narchitecture for this formulation. NER-MQMRC architecture considers all\nentities as input to BERT for learning token embeddings with self-attention and\nleverages BERT-based entity representation for further improving these token\nembeddings for NER task. Evaluation on three NER datasets show that our\nproposed architecture leads to average 2.5 times faster training and 2.3 times\nfaster inference as compared to NER-SQMRC framework based models by considering\nall entities together in a single pass. Further, we show that our model\nperformance does not degrade compared to single-question based MRC (NER-SQMRC)\n(Devlin et al., 2019) leading to F1 gain of +0.41%, +0.32% and +0.27% for\nAE-Pub, Ecommerce5PT and Twitter datasets respectively.

To avoid the reduction of the explanation\nvalidity caused by correlated features, forward selection and aspect\nconsolidation were implemented.\nResults: Some black-box models outperformed DTs and LR. The forward-selected\nfeatures correspond to brain areas previously associated with AD. Shapley\nvalues identified biologically plausible associations with moderate to strong\ncorrelations with feature importances. The most important RF features to\npredict AD conversion were the volume of the amygdalae, and a cognitive test\nscore.

The core of this task is\nto train a point-to-box regressor on well-labeled images that can be used to\npredict credible bounding boxes for each point annotation. We challenge the\nprior belief that existing CNN-based detectors are not compatible with this\ntask. Based on the classic R-CNN architecture, we propose an effective\npoint-to-box regressor: Group R-CNN. Group R-CNN first uses instance-level\nproposal grouping to generate a group of proposals for each point annotation\nand thus can obtain a high recall rate. To better distinguish different\ninstances and improve precision, we propose instance-level proposal assignment\nto replace the vanilla assignment strategy adopted in the original R-CNN\nmethods. As naive instance-level assignment brings converging difficulty, we\npropose instance-aware representation learning which consists of instance-aware\nfeature enhancement and instance-aware parameter generation to overcome this\nissue. Comprehensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method. Specifically, Group R-CNN significantly\noutperforms the prior method Point DETR by 3.9 mAP with 5% well-labeled images,\nwhich is the most challenging scenario.

A main limitation\nof conventional NeRFs is that they often fail to produce high-quality\nrenderings under novel viewpoints that are significantly different from the\ntraining viewpoints. In this paper, instead of exploiting few-shot image\nsynthesis, we study the novel view extrapolation setting that (1) the training\nimages can well describe an object, and (2) there is a notable discrepancy\nbetween the training and test viewpoints' distributions. We present RapNeRF\n(RAy Priors) as a solution. Our insight is that the inherent appearances of a\n3D surface's arbitrary visible projections should be consistent. We thus\npropose a random ray casting policy that allows training unseen views using\nseen views. Furthermore, we show that a ray atlas pre-computed from the\nobserved rays' viewing directions could further enhance the rendering quality\nfor extrapolated views. A main limitation is that RapNeRF would remove the\nstrong view-dependent effects because it leverages the multi-view consistency\nproperty.",

In this paper, we study an energy\nefficient cooperation scheme which employs network coding to enhance the energy\nefficiency for mobile devices. Herein we propose that the mobile devices are\nclustered into mobile small cells with one of the mobile devices acting as a\ngroup head with basic transceiver, coding and relaying functionalities. Group\nheads coordinate the transmissions from the mobile devices in the mobile small\ncell to the network's base stations. The objective function of the cooperative\nscheme is to minimize mobile devices' energy consumption subject to a certain\nbit error probability. The proposed network-coding based scheme has been\nevaluated by means of numerical simulations and compared to both a conventional\ndirect transmit scheme, with no cooperation groups, and a cooperative relaying\nscheme. Results show that, with network-coded cooperation, energy efficiency\nmay significantly increase provided the density of base stations and mobile\ndevices is below a certain value. Above this value none of the compared\ncooperation schemes may improve energy efficiency, but rather power consumption\nis reduced only when mobile devices transmit via base stations in their close\nproximity.",

Existing methods usually rely on a co-association (CA) matrix\nthat measures how many times two samples are grouped into the same cluster\naccording to the base clusterings to achieve ensemble clustering. However, when\nthe constructed CA matrix is of low quality, the performance will degrade. In\nthis paper, we propose a simple yet effective CA matrix self-enhancement\nframework that can improve the CA matrix to achieve better clustering\nperformance. Specifically, we first extract the high-confidence (HC)\ninformation from the base clusterings to form a sparse HC matrix. By\npropagating the highly-reliable information of the HC matrix to the CA matrix\nand complementing the HC matrix according to the CA matrix simultaneously, the\nproposed method generates an enhanced CA matrix for better clustering.\nTechnically, the proposed model is formulated as a symmetric constrained convex\noptimization problem, which is efficiently solved by an alternating iterative\nalgorithm with convergence and global optimum theoretically guaranteed.\nExtensive experimental comparisons with twelve state-of-the-art methods on\neight benchmark datasets substantiate the effectiveness, flexibility and\nefficiency of the proposed model in ensemble clustering.

Currently, computational\npredictions of drug-gene interactions mainly focus on the binding interactions\nwithout considering other relation types like agonist, antagonist, etc. In\naddition, existing methods either heavily rely on high-quality domain features\nor are intrinsically transductive, which limits the capacity of models to\ngeneralize to drugs/genes that lack external information or are unseen during\nthe training process. To address these problems, we propose a novel\nCommunicative Subgraph representation learning for Multi-relational Inductive\ndrug-Gene interactions prediction (CoSMIG), where the predictions of drug-gene\nrelations are made through subgraph patterns, and thus are naturally inductive\nfor unseen drugs/genes without retraining or utilizing external domain\nfeatures. Moreover, the model strengthened the relations on the drug-gene graph\nthrough a communicative message passing mechanism. To evaluate our method, we\ncompiled two new benchmark datasets from DrugBank and DGIdb.

In the\nfirst stage, the configuration of the deeper layers is learned automatically\nand finetuned over the target dataset. Later, in the second stage, the\nredundant filters are pruned from the fine-tuned CNN to decrease the network's\ncomplexity for the target task while preserving the performance. This two-stage\nmechanism finds a compact version of the pre-trained CNN with optimal structure\n(number of filters in a convolutional layer, number of neurons in a dense\nlayer, and so on) from the hypothesis space. The efficacy of the proposed\nmethod is evaluated using VGG-16, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-121 on CalTech-101,\nCalTech-256, and Stanford Dogs datasets. The proposed TASCNet reduces the\ncomputational complexity of pre-trained CNNs over the target task by reducing\nboth trainable parameters and FLOPs which enables resource-efficient knowledge\ntransfer.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in self-supervised modeling of text and images open new\nopportunities for computational models of child language acquisition, which is\nbelieved to rely heavily on cross-modal signals. However, prior studies have\nbeen limited by their reliance on vision models trained on large image datasets\nannotated with a pre-defined set of depicted object categories. This is (a) not\nfaithful to the information children receive and (b) prohibits the evaluation\nof such models with respect to category learning tasks, due to the pre-imposed\ncategory structure.

    "abstract": "Robust perception is an essential component to enable long-term operation of\nmobile robots. It depends on failure resilience through reliable sensor data\nand preprocessing, as well as failure awareness through introspection, for\nexample the ability to self-assess localization performance. This paper\npresents CorAl: a principled, intuitive, and generalizable method to measure\nthe quality of alignment between pairs of point clouds, which learns to detect\nalignment errors in a self-supervised manner. CorAl compares the differential\nentropy in the point clouds separately with the entropy in their union to\naccount for entropy inherent to the scene. By making use of dual entropy\nmeasurements, we obtain a quality metric that is highly sensitive to small\nalignment errors and still generalizes well to unseen environments. In this\nwork, we extend our previous work on lidar-only CorAl to radar data by\nproposing a two-stage filtering technique that produces high-quality point\nclouds from noisy radar scans. Thus we target robust perception in two ways: by\nintroducing a method that introspectively assesses alignment quality, and\napplying it to an inherently robust sensor modality. We show that our filtering\ntechnique combined with CorAl can be applied to the problem of alignment\nclassification, and that it detects small alignment errors in urban settings\nwith up to 98% accuracy, and with up to 96% if trained only in a different\nenvironment. Our lidar and radar experiments demonstrate that CorAl outperforms\nprevious methods both on the ETH lidar benchmark, which includes several indoor\nand outdoor environments, and the large-scale Oxford and MulRan radar data sets\nfor urban traffic scenarios The results also demonstrate that CorAl generalizes\nvery well across substantially different environments without the need of\nretraining.",

    "abstract": "Many startups and companies worldwide have been using project management\nsoftware and tools to monitor, track and manage their projects. For software\nprojects, the number of tasks from the beginning to the end is quite a large\nnumber that sometimes takes a lot of time and effort to search and link the\ncurrent task to a group of previous ones for further references. This paper\nproposes an efficient task dependency recommendation algorithm to suggest tasks\ndependent on a given task that the user has just created. We present an\nefficient feature engineering step and construct a deep neural network to this\naim. We performed extensive experiments on two different large projects\n(MDLSITE from moodle.org and FLUME from apache.org) to find the best features\nin 28 combinations of features and the best performance model using two\nembedding methods (GloVe and FastText). We consider three types of models (GRU,\nCNN, LSTM) using Accuracy@K, MRR@K, and Recall@K (where K = 1, 2, 3, and 5) and\nbaseline models using traditional methods: TF-IDF with various matching score\ncalculating such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance,\nand Chebyshev distance. After many experiments, the GloVe Embedding and CNN\nmodel reached the best result in our dataset, so we chose this model as our\nproposed method. In addition, adding the time filter in the post-processing\nstep can significantly improve the recommendation system's performance. The\nexperimental results show that our proposed method can reach 0.2335 in\nAccuracy@1 and MRR@1 and 0.2011 in Recall@1 of dataset FLUME. With the MDLSITE\ndataset, we obtained 0.1258 in Accuracy@1 and MRR@1 and 0.1141 in Recall@1. In\nthe top 5, our model reached 0.3040 in Accuracy@5, 0.2563 MRR@5, and 0.2651\nRecall@5 in FLUME.

In this paper, we present a\nflexible and high-performance 3D detection framework, named MPPNet, for 3D\ntemporal object detection with point cloud sequences. We propose a novel\nthree-hierarchy framework with proxy points for multi-frame feature encoding\nand interactions to achieve better detection. The three hierarchies conduct\nper-frame feature encoding, short-clip feature fusion, and whole-sequence\nfeature aggregation, respectively. To enable processing long-sequence point\nclouds with reasonable computational resources, intra-group feature mixing and\ninter-group feature attention are proposed to form the second and third feature\nencoding hierarchies, which are recurrently applied for aggregating multi-frame\ntrajectory features. The proxy points not only act as consistent object\nrepresentations for each frame, but also serve as the courier to facilitate\nfeature interaction between frames. The experiments on largeWaymo Open dataset\nshow that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods with large margins\nwhen applied to both short (e.g., 4-frame) and long (e.g., 16-frame) point\ncloud sequences.

    "abstract": "We present TIPS-GAN, a new approach to improve the accuracy and stability in\nunsupervised adversarial 2D to 3D human pose estimation. In our work we\ndemonstrate that the human kinematic skeleton should not be assumed as one\nspatially dependent structure. In fact, we believe when a full 2D pose is\nprovided during training, there is an inherent bias learned where the 3D\ncoordinate of a keypoint is spatially codependent on the 2D locations of all\nother keypoints. To investigate our theory we follow previous adversarial\napproaches but trained two generators on spatially independent parts of the\nkinematic skeleton, the torso and the legs. During our study we find that\nimproving self-consistency is key to lowering the evaluation error and\ntherefore introduce new consistency constraints within the standard adversarial\ncycle. We then produced a final TIPS model via knowledge distillation which can\npredict the 3D coordinates for the entire 2D pose with improved results.\nFurthermore we help address the question left unanswered in prior adversarial\nlearning papers of how long to train for a truly unsupervised scenario. We show\nthat two independent generators training adversarially can hold a minimum error\nagainst a discriminator for a longer period of time than that of a solo\ngenerator which will diverge due to the adversarial network becoming unstable.\nTIPS decreases the average error by 18\\% when compared to that of a baseline\nsolo generator.

These results\nhave inspired efforts to understand the limits of LLMs so as to evaluate how\nfar we are from achieving human level general natural language understanding.\nIn this work, we challenge the capability of LLMs with the new task of Ethical\nQuandary Generative Question Answering. Ethical quandary questions are more\nchallenging to address because multiple conflicting answers may exist to a\nsingle quandary. We propose a system, AiSocrates, that provides an answer with\na deliberative exchange of different perspectives to an ethical quandary, in\nthe approach of Socratic philosophy, instead of providing a closed answer like\nan oracle. AiSocrates searches for different ethical principles applicable to\nthe ethical quandary and generates an answer conditioned on the chosen\nprinciples through prompt-based few-shot learning. We also address safety\nconcerns by providing a human controllability option in choosing ethical\nprinciples. We show that AiSocrates generates promising answers to ethical\nquandary questions with multiple perspectives, 6.92% more often than answers\nwritten by human philosophers by one measure, but the system still needs\nimprovement to match the coherence of human philosophers fully.

The problem has been considered before but the proposed\nneural architectures are complex and the results are often mixed. In this work,\nwe use a simple and general GNN architecture and aim at obtaining crisp\nexperimental results and a deeper understanding: either the policy greedy in\nthe learned value function achieves close to 100% generalization over instances\nlarger than those used in training, or the failure must be understood, and\npossibly fixed, logically. For this, we exploit the relation established\nbetween the expressive power of GNNs and the $C_{2}$ fragment of first-order\nlogic (namely, FOL with 2 variables and counting quantifiers). We find for\nexample that domains with general policies that require more expressive\nfeatures can be solved with GNNs once the states are extended with suitable\n\"derived atoms\" encoding role compositions and transitive closures that do not\nfit into $C_{2}$. The work follows the GNN approach for learning optimal\ngeneral policies in a supervised fashion (Stahlberg, Bonet, Geffner, 2022); but\nthe learned policies are no longer required to be optimal (which expands the\nscope, as many planning domains do not have general optimal policies) and are\nlearned without supervision.

In this work, we\npropose a probabilistic generative approach which incorporates domain\nknowledge, i.e., community membership, as a fundamental model for regular\nbehavior, and thus flag potential anomalies deviating from this pattern. In\nfact, community membership act as the building blocks of a null model to\nidentify the regular interaction patterns. The structural information is\nincluded in the model through latent variables for community membership and\nanomaly parameter. The algorithm aims at inferring these latent parameters and\nthen output the labels identifying anomalies on the network edges.",

    "abstract": "The task of machine reading comprehension (MRC) is a useful benchmark to\nevaluate the natural language understanding of machines. It has gained\npopularity in the natural language processing (NLP) field mainly due to the\nlarge number of datasets released for many languages. However, the research in\nMRC has been understudied in several domains, including religious texts. The\ngoal of the Qur'an QA 2022 shared task is to fill this gap by producing\nstate-of-the-art question answering and reading comprehension research on\nQur'an. This paper describes the DTW entry to the Quran QA 2022 shared task.\nOur methodology uses transfer learning to take advantage of available Arabic\nMRC data. We further improve the results using various ensemble learning\nstrategies. Our approach provided a partial Reciprocal Rank (pRR) score of 0.49\non the test set, proving its strong performance on the task.",

For channel coding, we\nshow that the recently proposed algorithm of Tridenski and Zamir for computing\nstrong converse exponent has the attractive property that the objective\nfunction alternately takes the forms appearing in Arimoto's and Dueck and\nK\\\"orner's exponents. Because of this property, the convergence of the\nalgorithm directly implies the match of the two exponents. Then, we consider a\nspecial case of Tridenski et al.'s generalized algorithm of that has not been\nexamined in depth. We show that the objective function of this algorithm also\nhas the interesting property that it takes the forms of Dueck and K\\\"orner's\nexponent and another representation of the strong converse exponent derived by\nArimoto's algorithm. This particular case is important because the objective\nfunction in this case can be used to prove that the Gallager and Csisz\\'ar and\nK\\\"orner error exponents agree.63 For lossy source coding, we propose two new\nalgorithms for computing the Csisz\\'ar and K\\\"orner's strong converse exponent.\nWe also define a function similar to Blahut's error exponent with a negative\nslope parameter for source coding. We show that one of the proposed algorithms\nhas the property that the objective function alternately takes the forms of\nCsisz\\'ar and K\\\"orner's exponent and the newly defined exponent function. The\nconvergence of the algorithm proves that the new exponent function coincides\nwith the Csisz\\'ar and K\\\"orner exponent. We also prove that Arimoto algorithm\nfor computing error exponent of lossy source coding can work for negative $\\rho\n\\ge -1$ and thus can be used to compute the new exponent function.

A\ntypical solution for few-shot generation is to transfer a well-trained GAN\nmodel from a data-rich source domain to the data-deficient target domain. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel self-supervised transfer scheme termed D3T-GAN,\naddressing the cross-domain GANs transfer in few-shot image generation.\nSpecifically, we design two individual strategies to transfer knowledge between\ngenerators and discriminators, respectively. To transfer knowledge between\ngenerators, we conduct a data-dependent transformation, which projects and\nreconstructs the target samples into the source generator space. Then, we\nperform knowledge transfer from transformed samples to generated samples. To\ntransfer knowledge between discriminators, we design a multi-level discriminant\nknowledge distillation from the source discriminator to the target\ndiscriminator on both the real and fake samples. Extensive experiments show\nthat our method improve the quality of generated images and achieves the\nstate-of-the-art FID scores on commonly used datasets.",

The key design\nproperty in RPKI that allows our attacks is the tradeoff between connectivity\nand security: when networks cannot retrieve RPKI information from publication\npoints, they make routing decisions in BGP without validating RPKI. We exploit\nthis tradeoff to develop attacks that prevent the retrieval of the RPKI objects\nfrom the public repositories, thereby disabling RPKI validation and exposing\nthe RPKI-protected networks to prefix hijack attacks.\nWe demonstrate experimentally that at least 47% of the public repositories\nare vulnerable against a specific version of our attacks, a rate-limiting\noff-path downgrade attack. We also show that all the current RPKI relying party\nimplementations are vulnerable to attacks by a malicious publication point.\nThis translates to 20.4% of the IPv4 address space.\nWe provide recommendations for preventing our downgrade attacks. However,\nresolving the fundamental problem is not straightforward: if the relying\nparties prefer security over connectivity and insist on RPKI validation when\nROAs cannot be retrieved, the victim AS may become disconnected from many more\nnetworks than just the one that the adversary wishes to hijack.

As a corollary,\nletting $\\epsilon$ go to $0$, we obtain a sequential algorithm for testing\ncloseness when no a priori bound on $TV(\\mathcal{D}_1, \\mathcal{D}_2)$ is given\nthat has a sample complexity\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\frac{n^{2/3}}{TV(\\mathcal{D}_1, \\mathcal{D}_2)^{4/3}})$:\nthis improves over the $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\frac{n/\\log n}{TV(\\mathcal{D}_1,\n\\mathcal{D}_2)^{2} })$ tester of \\cite{daskalakis2017optimal} and is optimal up\nto multiplicative constants. We also establish limitations of sequential\nalgorithms for the problem of testing identity and closeness: they can improve\nthe worst case number of samples by at most a constant factor.",

In\nthe current study, we assess the performance and added value of processing\ncomplete digital endoscopic video sequences for the automatic recognition of\nstone morphological features during a standard-of-care intra-operative session.\nTo this end, a computer-aided video classifier was developed to predict in-situ\nthe morphology of stone using an intra-operative digital endoscopic video\nacquired in a clinical setting.\nThe proposed technique was evaluated on pure (i.e. include one morphology)\nand mixed (i.e. include at least two morphologies) stones involving \"Ia/Calcium\nOxalate Monohydrate (COM)\", \"IIb/ Calcium Oxalate Dihydrate (COD)\" and\n\"IIIb/Uric Acid (UA)\" morphologies. 71 digital endoscopic videos (50 exhibited\nonly one morphological type and 21 displayed two) were analyzed using the\nproposed video classifier (56840 frames processed in total). Using the proposed\napproach, diagnostic performances (averaged over both pure and mixed stone\ntypes) were as follows: balanced accuracy=88%, sensitivity=80%,\nspecificity=95%, precision=78% and F1-score=78%.\nThe obtained results demonstrate that AI applied on digital endoscopic video\nsequences is a promising tool for collecting morphological information during\nthe time-course of the stone fragmentation process without resorting to any\nhuman intervention for stone delineation or selection of good quality steady\nframes.

While\ndetecting drivers' stress and negative emotions can significantly help with\nthis goal, understanding what might be associated with increases in drivers'\nnegative emotions and high stress level, might better help with planning\ninterventions. While studies have provided significant insight into detecting\ndrivers' emotions and stress levels; not many studies focused on the reasons\nbehind changes in stress levels and negative emotions. In this study, by using\na naturalistic driving study database, we analyze the changes in the driving\nscene, including road objects and the dynamical relationship between the ego\nvehicle and the lead vehicle with respect to changes in drivers'\npsychophysiological metrics (i.e., heart rate (HR) and facial expressions). We\nfind that different road objects might be associated with varying levels of\nincrease in drivers' HR as well as different proportions of negative facial\nemotions detected through computer vision. Our results indicate that larger\nvehicles on the road, such as trucks and buses, are associated with the highest\namount of increase in drivers' HR as well as negative emotions. Additionally,\nwe provide evidence that shorter distances to the lead vehicle in naturalistic\ndriving, as well as the higher standard deviation in the distance, might be\nassociated with a higher number of abrupt increases in drivers' HR, depicting a\npossible increase in stress level.

    "abstract": "People perceive the world with multiple senses (e.g., through hearing sounds,\nreading words and seeing objects). However, most existing AI systems only\nprocess an individual modality. This paper presents an approach that excels at\nhandling multiple modalities of information with a single model. In our\n\"{SkillNet}\" model, different parts of the parameters are specialized for\nprocessing different modalities. Unlike traditional dense models that always\nactivate all the model parameters, our model sparsely activates parts of the\nparameters whose skills are relevant to the task. Such model design enables\nSkillNet to learn skills in a more interpretable way. We develop our model for\nfive modalities including text, image, sound, video and code. Results show\nthat, SkillNet performs comparably to five modality-specific fine-tuned models.\nMoreover, our model supports self-supervised pretraining with the same sparsely\nactivated way, resulting in better initialized parameters for different\nmodalities. We find that pretraining significantly improves the performance of\nSkillNet on five modalities, on par with or even better than baselines with\nmodality-specific pretraining.

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in adversarial machine learning is to quantify how much\ntraining data is needed in the presence of evasion attacks. In this paper we\naddress this issue within the framework of PAC learning, focusing on the class\nof decision lists. Given that distributional assumptions are essential in the\nadversarial setting, we work with probability distributions on the input data\nthat satisfy a Lipschitz condition: nearby points have similar probability. Our\nkey results illustrate that the adversary's budget (that is, the number of bits\nit can perturb on each input) is a fundamental quantity in determining the\nsample complexity of robust learning. Our first main result is a\nsample-complexity lower bound: the class of monotone conjunctions (essentially\nthe simplest non-trivial hypothesis class on the Boolean hypercube) and any\nsuperclass has sample complexity at least exponential in the adversary's\nbudget. Our second main result is a corresponding upper bound: for every fixed\n$k$ the class of $k$-decision lists has polynomial sample complexity against a\n$\\log(n)$-bounded adversary. This sheds further light on the question of\nwhether an efficient PAC learning algorithm can always be used as an efficient\n$\\log(n)$-robust learning algorithm under the uniform distribution.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel space-efficient graph coarsening technique for n-vertex\nseparable graphs G, in particular for planar graphs, called cloud partition,\nwhich partitions the vertices V(G) into disjoint sets C of size O(log n) such\nthat each C induces a connected subgraph of G. Using this partition P we\nconstruct a so-called structure-maintaining minor F of G via specific\ncontractions within the disjoint sets such that F has O(n/log n) vertices. The\ncombination of (F, P) is referred to as a cloud decomposition. We call a graph\nG=(V, E) separable if it admits to an O(n^c)-separator theorem for some\nconstant c < 1 meaning there exists a separator S subset V that partitions V\ninto {A, S, B} such that no vertices of A and B are adjacent in G and neither A\nnor B contain more than c'n vertices for a fixed constant c' < 1. Due to the\nlast property such separators are called balanced. This famously includes\nplanar graphs, which admit an O(sqrt(n) n)-separator theorem. For planar graphs\nwe show that a cloud decomposition can be constructed in O(n) time and using\nO(n) bits. Given a cloud decomposition (F, P) constructed for a planar graph G\nwe are able to find a balanced separator of G in O(n/log n) time. Contrary to\nrelated publications, we do not make use of an embedding of the input graph.\nThis allows us to construct the succinct encoding scheme for planar graphs due\nto Blelloch and Farzan (CPM 2010) in O(n) time and O(n) bits improving both\nruntime and space by a factor of Theta(log n). As an additional application of\nour cloud decomposition we show that a tree decomposition for planar graphs of\nwidth O(n^(1/2 + epsilon)) for any epsilon > 0 can be constructed in O(n) bits\nand a time linear in the size of the tree decomposition. Finally, we generalize\nour cloud decomposition from planar graphs to arbitrary separable graphs.",

The computation of \"abstract sameness relations\" is assumed to play an\nimportant role in human language acquisition and processing, especially in\nlearning more complex grammar rules. In order to investigate this mechanism in\nBERT and other pre-trained language models (PLMs), the experiment designs from\nstudies with infants were taken as the starting point. On this basis, we\ndesigned experimental settings in which each element from the original studies\nwas mapped to a component of language models.

    "abstract": "The recently proposed CP language adopts Compositional Programming: a new\nmodular programming style that solves challenging problems such as the\nExpression Problem. CP is implemented on top of a polymorphic core language\nwith disjoint intersection types called Fi+. The semantics of Fi+ employs an\nelaboration to a target language and relies on a sophisticated proof technique\nto prove the coherence of the elaboration. Unfortunately, the proof technique\nis technically challenging and hard to scale to many common features, including\nrecursion or impredicative polymorphism. Thus, the original formulation of Fi+\ndoes not support the two later features, which creates a gap between theory and\npractice, since CP fundamentally relies on them.\nThis paper presents a new formulation of Fi+ based on a type-directed\noperational semantics (TDOS). The TDOS approach was recently proposed to model\nthe semantics of languages with disjoint intersection types (but without\npolymorphism). Our work shows that the TDOS approach can be extended to\nlanguages with disjoint polymorphism and model the full Fi+ calculus. Unlike\nthe elaboration semantics, which gives the semantics to Fi+ indirectly via a\ntarget language, the TDOS approach gives a semantics to Fi+ directly. With a\nTDOS, there is no need for a coherence proof. Instead, we can simply prove that\nthe semantics is deterministic. The proof of determinism only uses simple\nreasoning techniques, such as straightforward induction, and is able to handle\nproblematic features such as recursion and impredicative polymorphism. This\nremoves the gap between theory and practice and validates the original proofs\nof correctness for CP. We formalized the TDOS variant of the Fi+ calculus and\nall its proofs in the Coq proof assistant.",

The PA-PIR-SI problem includes one or more remote servers storing\ncopies of a dataset of $K$ messages, and a user who knows $M$ out of $K$\nmessages -- the identities of which are unknown to the server -- as a prior\nside information, and wishes to retrieve one of the remaining $K-M$ messages.\nThe goal of the user is to minimize the amount of information they must\ndownload from the server while revealing no information about the identity of\nthe desired message.

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning-based approaches for visual-inertial odometry\n(VIO) have shown remarkable performance outperforming traditional geometric\nmethods. Yet, all existing methods use both the visual and inertial\nmeasurements for every pose estimation incurring potential computational\nredundancy. While visual data processing is much more expensive than that for\nthe inertial measurement unit (IMU), it may not always contribute to improving\nthe pose estimation accuracy. In this paper, we propose an adaptive\ndeep-learning based VIO method that reduces computational redundancy by\nopportunistically disabling the visual modality. Specifically, we train a\npolicy network that learns to deactivate the visual feature extractor on the\nfly based on the current motion state and IMU readings. A Gumbel-Softmax trick\nis adopted to train the policy network to make the decision process\ndifferentiable for end-to-end system training. The learned strategy is\ninterpretable, and it shows scenario-dependent decision patterns for adaptive\ncomplexity reduction. Experiment results show that our method achieves a\nsimilar or even better performance than the full-modality baseline with up to\n78.8% computational complexity reduction for KITTI dataset evaluation.

    "abstract": "Recent time-contrastive learning approaches manage to learn invariant object\nrepresentations without supervision. This is achieved by mapping successive\nviews of an object onto close-by internal representations. When considering\nthis learning approach as a model of the development of human object\nrecognition, it is important to consider what visual input a toddler would\ntypically observe while interacting with objects. First, human vision is highly\nfoveated, with high resolution only available in the central region of the\nfield of view. Second, objects may be seen against a blurry background due to\ninfants' limited depth of field. Third, during object manipulation a toddler\nmostly observes close objects filling a large part of the field of view due to\ntheir rather short arms. Here, we study how these effects impact the quality of\nvisual representations learnt through time-contrastive learning. To this end,\nwe let a visually embodied agent \"play\" with objects in different locations of\na near photo-realistic flat. During each play session the agent views an object\nin multiple orientations before turning its body to view another object. The\nresulting sequence of views feeds a time-contrastive learning algorithm. Our\nresults show that visual statistics mimicking those of a toddler improve object\nrecognition accuracy in both familiar and novel environments. We argue that\nthis effect is caused by the reduction of features extracted in the background,\na neural network bias for large features in the image and a greater similarity\nbetween novel and familiar background regions.

    "abstract": "Formulated as a conditional generation problem, face animation aims at\nsynthesizing continuous face images from a single source image driven by a set\nof conditional face motion. Previous works mainly model the face motion as\nconditions with 1D or 2D representation (e.g., action units, emotion codes,\nlandmark), which often leads to low-quality results in some complicated\nscenarios such as continuous generation and largepose transformation. To tackle\nthis problem, the conditions are supposed to meet two requirements, i.e.,\nmotion information preserving and geometric continuity. To this end, we propose\na novel representation based on a 3D geometric flow, termed facial flow, to\nrepresent the natural motion of the human face at any pose. Compared with other\nprevious conditions, the proposed facial flow well controls the continuous\nchanges to the face. After that, in order to utilize the facial flow for face\nediting, we build a synthesis framework generating continuous images with\nconditional facial flows. To fully take advantage of the motion information of\nfacial flows, a hierarchical conditional framework is designed to combine the\nextracted multi-scale appearance features from images and motion features from\nflows in a hierarchical manner. The framework then decodes multiple fused\nfeatures back to images progressively. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",

These candidate items are then ranked and pruned in later stages of\nrecommender systems using a more complex ranking model. Since candidate\ngeneration is the top of the recommendation funnel, it is important to retrieve\na high-recall candidate set to feed into downstream ranking models. A common\napproach for candidate generation is to leverage approximate nearest neighbor\n(ANN) search from a single dense query embedding; however, this approach this\ncan yield a low-diversity result set with many near duplicates. As users often\nhave multiple interests, candidate retrieval should ideally return a diverse\nset of candidates reflective of the user's multiple interests.

By\nquerying each of a user's mixture component in proportion to their mixture\nweights, we retrieve a high-diversity set of candidates reflecting elements\nfrom each of a user's interests.

    "title": "The Mechanism of Prediction Head in Non-contrastive Self-supervised  Learning",
    "abstract": "Recently the surprising discovery of the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL)\nmethod by Grill et al. shows the negative term in contrastive loss can be\nremoved if we add the so-called prediction head to the network. This initiated\nthe research of non-contrastive self-supervised learning. It is mysterious why\neven when there exist trivial collapsed global optimal solutions, neural\nnetworks trained by (stochastic) gradient descent can still learn competitive\nrepresentations. This phenomenon is a typical example of implicit bias in deep\nlearning and remains little understood.\nIn this work, we present our empirical and theoretical discoveries on\nnon-contrastive self-supervised learning. Empirically, we find that when the\nprediction head is initialized as an identity matrix with only its off-diagonal\nentries being trainable, the network can learn competitive representations even\nthough the trivial optima still exist in the training objective. Theoretically,\nwe present a framework to understand the behavior of the trainable, but\nidentity-initialized prediction head. Under a simple setting, we characterized\nthe substitution effect and acceleration effect of the prediction head. The\nsubstitution effect happens when learning the stronger features in some neurons\ncan substitute for learning these features in other neurons through updating\nthe prediction head. And the acceleration effect happens when the substituted\nfeatures can accelerate the learning of other weaker features to prevent them\nfrom being ignored. These two effects enable the neural networks to learn all\nthe features rather than focus only on learning the stronger features, which is\nlikely the cause of the dimensional collapse phenomenon. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is also the first end-to-end optimization guarantee for\nnon-contrastive methods using nonlinear neural networks with a trainable\nprediction head and normalization.",

Our sketching operator, based on a scheme for compressed sensing by Li\net al. and Bakshi et al., uses a combination of a sparse parity check matrix\nand a partial DFT matrix. Our main contribution is the design and analysis of a\ntwo-stage iterative algorithm which recovers the singular vectors by exploiting\nthe simultaneously sparse and low-rank structure of the matrix. We derive a\nnonasymptotic bound on the probability of exact recovery. We also show how the\nscheme can be adapted to tackle matrices that are approximately sparse and\nlow-rank.

    "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Personalised medicine remains a major challenge\nfor scientists. The rapid growth of Machine learning and Deep learning has made\nit a feasible alternative for predicting the most appropriate therapy for\nindividual patients. However, the lack of interpretation of their results and\nhigh computational requirements make many reluctant to use these methods.\nMethods: Several Machine learning and Deep learning models have been\nimplemented into a single software tool, SIBILA. Once the models are trained,\nSIBILA applies a range of interpretability methods to identify the input\nfeatures that each model considered the most important to predict. In addition,\nall the features obtained are put in common to estimate the global attribution\nof each variable to the predictions. To facilitate its use by non-experts,\nSIBILA is also available to all users free of charge as a web server at\nhttps://bio-hpc.ucam.edu/sibila/.\nResults: SIBILA has been applied to three case studies to show its accuracy\nand efficiency in classification and regression problems. The first two cases\nproved that SIBILA can make accurate predictions even on uncleaned datasets.\nThe last case demonstrates that SIBILA can be applied to medical contexts with\nreal data.\nConclusion: With the aim of becoming a powerful decision-making tool for\nclinicians, SIBILA has been developed. SIBILA is a novel software tool that\nleverages interpretable machine learning to make accurate predictions and\nexplain how models made those decisions. SIBILA can be run on high-performance\ncomputing platforms, drastically reducing computing times.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of verifying that the functions of a program meet\ntheir contracts, specified by pre/postconditions. We follow an approach based\non constrained Horn clauses (CHCs) by which the verification problem is reduced\nto the problem of checking satisfiability of a set of clauses derived from the\ngiven program and contracts. We consider programs that manipulate algebraic\ndata types (ADTs) and a class of contracts specified by catamorphisms, that is,\nfunctions defined by simple recursion schemata on the given ADTs. We show by\nseveral examples that state-of-the-art CHC satisfiability tools are not\neffective at solving the satisfiability problems obtained by direct translation\nof the contracts into CHCs. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a\ntransformation technique that removes the ADT terms from CHCs and derives new\nsets of clauses that work on basic sorts only, such as integers and booleans.\nThus, when using the derived CHCs there is no need for induction rules on ADTs.\nWe prove that the transformation is sound, that is, if the derived set of CHCs\nis satisfiable, then so is the original set. We also prove that the\ntransformation always terminates for the class of contracts specified by\ncatamorphisms. Finally, we present the experimental results obtained by an\nimplementation of our technique when verifying many non-trivial contracts for\nADT manipulating programs.",

    "abstract": "Despite the recent success of deep learning architectures, person\nre-identification (ReID) remains a challenging problem in real-word\napplications. Several unsupervised single-target domain adaptation (STDA)\nmethods have recently been proposed to limit the decline in ReID accuracy\ncaused by the domain shift that typically occurs between source and target\nvideo data. Given the multimodal nature of person ReID data (due to variations\nacross camera viewpoints and capture conditions), training a common CNN\nbackbone to address domain shifts across multiple target domains, can provide\nan efficient solution for real-time ReID applications. Although multi-target\ndomain adaptation (MTDA) has not been widely addressed in the ReID literature,\na straightforward approach consists in blending different target datasets, and\nperforming STDA on the mixture to train a common CNN. However, this approach\nmay lead to poor generalization, especially when blending a growing number of\ndistinct target domains to train a smaller CNN.\nTo alleviate this problem, we introduce a new MTDA method based on knowledge\ndistillation (KD-ReID) that is suitable for real-time person ReID applications.\nOur method adapts a common lightweight student backbone CNN over the target\ndomains by alternatively distilling from multiple specialized teacher CNNs,\neach one adapted on data from a specific target domain. Extensive experiments\nconducted on several challenging person ReID datasets indicate that our\napproach outperforms state-of-art methods for MTDA, including blending methods,\nparticularly when training a compact CNN backbone like OSNet. Results suggest\nthat our flexible MTDA approach can be employed to design cost-effective ReID\nsystems for real-time video surveillance applications.",

    "abstract": "We consider replication-based distributed storage systems in which each node\nstores the same quantum of data and each data bit stored has the same\nreplication factor across the nodes. Such systems are referred to as\n\\textit{balanced distributed databases}. When existing nodes leave or new nodes\nare added unto this system, the balanced nature of the database is lost, either\ndue to the reduction in the replication factor, or due to non-uniformity of the\nstorage at the nodes. This triggers a \\textit{rebalancing} algorithm, which\nexchanges data between the nodes so that the balance of the database is\nreinstated. In a recent work by Krishnan et al., coded transmissions were used\nto rebalance a carefully designed distributed database from a node removal or\naddition. These coded rebalancing schemes have optimal communication load,\nhowever require the file-size to be at least exponential in the system\nparameters. In this work, we consider a \\textit{cyclic balanced database}\n(where data is cyclically placed in the system nodes) and present coded\nrebalancing schemes for node removal and addition in such a database. These\ndatabases (and the associated rebalancing schemes) require the file-size to be\nonly \\textit{cubic} in the number of nodes in the system.

We\npresent a method to train a classification system that achieves paragon\nperformance in both error rate and NFR, at the inference cost of a single\nmodel.

LDI affords the model flexibility to reduce error rate along with\nNFR. The method uses a homogeneous ensemble as the reference model for LDI,\nhence the name Ensemble LDI, or ELODI.

    "abstract": "Multilingual pre-trained models are known to suffer from the curse of\nmultilinguality, which causes per-language performance to drop as they cover\nmore languages. We address this issue by introducing language-specific modules,\nwhich allows us to grow the total capacity of the model, while keeping the\ntotal number of trainable parameters per language constant. In contrast with\nprior work that learns language-specific components post-hoc, we pre-train the\nmodules of our Cross-lingual Modular (X-Mod) models from the start. Our\nexperiments on natural language inference, named entity recognition and\nquestion answering show that our approach not only mitigates the negative\ninterference between languages, but also enables positive transfer, resulting\nin improved monolingual and cross-lingual performance. Furthermore, our\napproach enables adding languages post-hoc with no measurable drop in\nperformance, no longer limiting the model usage to the set of pre-trained\nlanguages.",

    "title": "Topologically-Aware Deformation Fields for Single-View 3D Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "We present a new framework for learning 3D object shapes and dense\ncross-object 3D correspondences from just an unaligned category-specific image\ncollection. The 3D shapes are generated implicitly as deformations to a\ncategory-specific signed distance field and are learned in an unsupervised\nmanner solely from unaligned image collections without any 3D supervision.\nGenerally, image collections on the internet contain several intra-category\ngeometric and topological variations, for example, different chairs can have\ndifferent topologies, which makes the task of joint shape and correspondence\nestimation much more challenging. Because of this, prior works either focus on\nlearning each 3D object shape individually without modeling cross-instance\ncorrespondences or perform joint shape and correspondence estimation on\ncategories with minimal intra-category topological variations. We overcome\nthese restrictions by learning a topologically-aware implicit deformation field\nthat maps a 3D point in the object space to a higher dimensional point in the\ncategory-specific canonical space. At inference time, given a single image, we\nreconstruct the underlying 3D shape by first implicitly deforming each 3D point\nin the object space to the learned category-specific canonical space using the\ntopologically-aware deformation field and then reconstructing the 3D shape as a\ncanonical signed distance field. Both canonical shape and deformation field are\nlearned end-to-end in an inverse-graphics fashion using a learned recurrent ray\nmarcher (SRN) as a differentiable rendering module. Our approach, dubbed TARS,\nachieves state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity on several datasets:\nShapeNet, Pascal3D+, CUB, and Pix3D chairs.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of stabilizing an undisturbed, scalar, linear system\nover a \"timing\" channel, namely a channel where information is communicated\nthrough the timestamps of the transmitted symbols. Each symbol transmitted from\na sensor to a controller in a closed-loop system is received subject to some to\nrandom delay. The sensor can encode messages in the waiting times between\nsuccessive transmissions and the controller must decode them from the\ninter-reception times of successive symbols. This set-up is analogous to a\ntelephone system where a transmitter signals a phone call to a receiver through\na \"ring\" and, after the random delay required to establish the connection; the\nreceiver is aware of the \"ring\" being received. Since there is no data payload\nexchange between the sensor and the controller, this set-up provides an\nabstraction for performing event-triggering control with zero-payload rate. We\nshow the following requirement for stabilization: for the state of the system\nto converge to zero in probability, the timing capacity of the channel should\nbe, essentially, at least as large as the entropy rate of the system.\nConversely, in the case the symbol delays are exponentially distributed, we\nshow an \"almost\" tight sufficient condition using a coding strategy that\nrefines the estimate of the decoded message every time a new symbol is\nreceived. Our results generalize previous zero-payload event-triggering control\nstrategies, revealing a fundamental limit in using timing information for\nstabilization, independent of any transmission strategy.",

    "abstract": "Audio-visual automatic speech recognition is a promising approach to robust\nASR under noisy conditions. However, up until recently it had been\ntraditionally studied in isolation assuming the video of a single speaking face\nmatches the audio, and selecting the active speaker at inference time when\nmultiple people are on screen was put aside as a separate problem. As an\nalternative, recent work has proposed to address the two problems\nsimultaneously with an attention mechanism, baking the speaker selection\nproblem directly into a fully differentiable model. One interesting finding was\nthat the attention indirectly learns the association between the audio and the\nspeaking face even though this correspondence is never explicitly provided at\ntraining time. In the present work we further investigate this connection and\nexamine the interplay between the two problems. With experiments involving over\n50 thousand hours of public YouTube videos as training data, we first evaluate\nthe accuracy of the attention layer on an active speaker selection task.\nSecondly, we show under closer scrutiny that an end-to-end model performs at\nleast as well as a considerably larger two-step system that utilizes a hard\ndecision boundary under various noise conditions and number of parallel face\ntracks.",

    "abstract": "When a model's performance differs across socially or culturally relevant\ngroups--like race, gender, or the intersections of many such groups--it is\noften called \"biased.\" While much of the work in algorithmic fairness over the\nlast several years has focused on developing various definitions of model\nfairness (the absence of group-wise model performance disparities) and\neliminating such \"bias,\" much less work has gone into rigorously measuring it.\nIn practice, it important to have high quality, human digestible measures of\nmodel performance disparities and associated uncertainty quantification about\nthem that can serve as inputs into multi-faceted decision-making processes. In\nthis paper, we show both mathematically and through simulation that many of the\nmetrics used to measure group-wise model performance disparities are themselves\nstatistically biased estimators of the underlying quantities they purport to\nrepresent. We argue that this can cause misleading conclusions about the\nrelative group-wise model performance disparities along different dimensions,\nespecially in cases where some sensitive variables consist of categories with\nfew members. We propose the \"double-corrected\" variance estimator, which\nprovides unbiased estimates and uncertainty quantification of the variance of\nmodel performance across groups. It is conceptually simple and easily\nimplementable without statistical software package or numerical optimization.\nWe demonstrate the utility of this approach through simulation and show on a\nreal dataset that while statistically biased estimators of model group-wise\nmodel performance disparities indicate statistically significant between-group\nmodel performance disparities, when accounting for statistical bias in the\nestimator, the estimated group-wise disparities in model performance are no\nlonger statistically significant.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been widely adopted for channel state information\n(CSI)-fingerprinting indoor localization systems. These systems usually consist\nof two main parts, i.e., a positioning network that learns the mapping from\nhigh-dimensional CSI to physical locations and a tracking system that utilizes\nhistorical CSI to reduce the positioning error. This paper presents a new\nlocalization system with high accuracy and generality. On the one hand, the\nreceptive field of the existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\npositioning networks is limited, restricting their performance as useful\ninformation in CSI is not explored thoroughly. As a solution, we propose a\nnovel attention-augmented Residual CNN to utilize the local information and\nglobal context in CSI exhaustively. On the other hand, considering the\ngenerality of a tracking system, we decouple the tracking system from the CSI\nenvironments so that one tracking system for all environments becomes possible.\nSpecifically, we remodel the tracking problem as a denoising task and solve it\nwith deep trajectory prior. Furthermore, we investigate how the precision\ndifference of inertial measurement units will adversely affect the tracking\nperformance and adopt plug-and-play to solve the precision difference problem.\nExperiments show the superiority of our methods over existing approaches in\nperformance and generality improvement.",

Prior to these, the\nstate of the art models based on the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which is a fourth\norder equation, allowed for derivation of surface tension models through\nthermodynamic arguments. In contrast, the second-order phase field models do\nnot follow a known energy law, and deriving a surface tension term for these\nmodels using thermodynamic arguments is not straight-forward. In this work, we\njustify that the energy-based surface tension model from the Cahn-Hilliard\ncontext can be adopted for second-order phase field models as well, and assess\nits performance. We test the surface tension model on three different\nsecond-order phase field equations; the conservative diffuse interface model of\nChiu and Lin [1], and two models based on the modified Allen-Cahn equation\nintroduced by Sun and Beckermann [2]. Using canonical tests, we illustrate the\nlower magnitude of spurious currents, better accuracy, and superior convergence\nproperties of the energy-based surface tension model compared to the continuum\nsurface force (CSF) model, which is a popular choice that is used in\nconjunction with second order phase field methods.

    "abstract": "Quantum computing (QC) offers a new computing paradigm that has the potential\nto provide significant speedups over classical computing. Each additional qubit\ndoubles the size of the computational state space available to a quantum\nalgorithm. Such exponentially expanding reach underlies QC's power, but at the\nsame time puts demanding requirements on the quantum processing units (QPU)\nhardware. On the other hand, purely classical simulations of quantum circuits\non either central processing unit (CPU) or graphics processing unit (GPU) scale\npoorly as they quickly become bottlenecked by runtime and memory. This paper\nintroduces CutQC, a scalable hybrid computing approach that distributes a large\nquantum circuit onto quantum (QPU) and classical platforms (CPU or GPU) for\nco-processing. CutQC demonstrates evaluation of quantum circuits that are\nlarger than the limit of QPU or classical simulation, and achieves much higher\nquantum circuit evaluation fidelity than the large NISQ devices achieve in\nreal-system runs.",

These methods lack mechanisms for modeling\nexplicitly non-discriminative regions which raises false-positive rates. We\npropose novel regularization terms, which enable the model to seek both\nnon-discriminative and discriminative regions, while discouraging unbalanced\nsegmentations and using only image class label. Our method is composed of two\nnetworks: a localizer that yields segmentation mask, followed by a classifier.\nThe training loss pushes the localizer to build a segmentation mask that holds\nmost discrimiantive regions while simultaneously modeling background regions.\nComprehensive experiments over two histology datasets showed the merits of our\nmethod in reducing false positives and accurately segmenting ROI.",

Hence, stable\nand robust motion correction is necessary to reconstruct high-resolution 3D\nfetal brain volume for clinical diagnosis and quantitative analysis. However,\nthe conventional registration-based correction has a limited capture range and\nis insufficient for detecting relatively large motions. Here, we present a\nnovel Affinity Fusion-based Framework for Iteratively Random Motion (AFFIRM)\ncorrection of the multi-slice fetal brain MRI. It learns the sequential motion\nfrom multiple stacks of slices and integrates the features between 2D slices\nand reconstructed 3D volume using affinity fusion, which resembles the\niterations between slice-to-volume registration and volumetric reconstruction\nin the regular pipeline. The method accurately estimates the motion regardless\nof brain orientations and outperforms other state-of-the-art learning-based\nmethods on the simulated motion-corrupted data, with a 48.4% reduction of mean\nabsolute error for rotation and 61.3% for displacement. We then incorporated\nAFFIRM into the multi-resolution slice-to-volume registration and tested it on\nthe real-world fetal MRI scans at different gestation stages.

Understanding the dynamics of news information creation and\ndispersion is important to accurately ascribe credit to influential work and\nunderstand how societal narratives develop. These dynamics can be modelled\nthrough a combination of information-theoretic natural language processing and\nnetworks; and can be parameterised using large quantities of textual data.\nHowever, it is challenging to see \"the wood for the trees\", i.e., to detect\nsmall but important flows of information in a sea of noise. Here we develop new\ncomparative techniques to estimate temporal information flow between pairs of\ntext producers. Using both simulated and real text data we compare the\nreliability and sensitivity of methods for estimating textual information flow,\nshowing that a metric that normalises by local neighbourhood structure provides\na robust estimate of information flow in large networks. We apply this metric\nto a large corpus of news organisations on Twitter and demonstrate its\nusefulness in identifying influence within an information ecosystem, finding\nthat average information contribution to the network is not correlated with the\nnumber of followers or the number of tweets. This suggests that small local\norganisations and right-wing organisations which have lower average follower\ncounts still contribute significant information to the ecosystem. Further, the\nmethods are applied to smaller full-text datasets of specific news events\nacross news sites and Russian troll bots on Twitter.

However, the Yoneda embedding does not preserve coproducts. It is\nperhaps less well-known that if we restrict the codomain of the Yoneda\nembedding to the full subcategory of limit-preserving functors, then this\nembedding preserves colimits, while still enjoying most of the other useful\nproperties of the Yoneda embedding.

    "title": "Faster quantum mixing of Markov chains in non-regular graph with fewer  qubits",
    "abstract": "Sampling from the stationary distribution is one of the fundamental tasks of\nMarkov chain-based algorithms and has important applications in machine\nlearning, combinatorial optimization and network science. For the quantum case,\nqsampling from Markov chains can be constructed as preparing quantum states\nwith amplitudes arbitrarily close to the square root of a stationary\ndistribution instead of classical sampling from a stationary distribution. In\nthis paper, a new qsampling algorithm for all reversible Markov chains is\nconstructed by discrete-time quantum walks and works without any limit compared\nwith existing results. In detail, we build a qsampling algorithm that not only\naccelerates non-regular graphs but also keeps the speed-up of existing quantum\nalgorithms for regular graphs. In non-regular graphs, the invocation of the\nquantum fast-forward algorithm accelerates existing state-of-the-art qsampling\nalgorithms for both discrete-time and continuous-time cases, especially on\nsparse graphs. Compared to existing algorithms we reduce log n, where n is the\nnumber of graph vertices. In regular graphs, our result matches other quantum\nalgorithms, and our reliance on the gap of Markov chains achieves quadratic\nspeedup compared with classical cases. For both cases, we reduce the number of\nancilla qubits required compared to the existing results. In some widely used\ngraphs and a series of sparse graphs where stationary distributions are\ndifficult to reach quickly, our algorithm is the first algorithm to achieve\ncomplete quadratic acceleration (without log factor) over the classical case\nwithout any limit. To enlarge success probability amplitude amplification is\nintroduced. We construct a new reflection on stationary state with fewer\nancilla qubits and think it may have independent application.",

    "abstract": "Variational quantum algorithms are the leading candidate for near-term\nadvantage on noisy quantum hardware. When training a parametrized quantum\ncircuit to solve a specific task, the choice of ansatz is one of the most\nimportant factors that determines the trainability and performance of the\nalgorithm. Problem-tailored ansatzes have become the standard for tasks in\noptimization or quantum chemistry, and yield more efficient algorithms with\nbetter performance than unstructured approaches. In quantum machine learning\n(QML), however, the literature on ansatzes that are motivated by the training\ndata structure is scarce. Considering that it is widely known that unstructured\nansatzes can become untrainable with increasing system size and circuit depth,\nit is of key importance to also study problem-tailored circuit architectures in\na QML context. In this work, we introduce an ansatz for learning tasks on\nweighted graphs that respects an important graph symmetry, namely equivariance\nunder node permutations. We evaluate the performance of this ansatz on a\ncomplex learning task on weighted graphs, where a ML model is used to implement\na heuristic for a combinatorial optimization problem. We analytically study the\nexpressivity of our ansatz at depth one, and numerically compare the\nperformance of our model on instances with up to 20 qubits to ansatzes where\nthe equivariance property is gradually broken. We show that our ansatz\noutperforms all others even in the small-instance regime. Our results\nstrengthen the notion that symmetry-preserving ansatzes are a key to success in\nQML and should be an active area of research in order to enable near-term\nadvantages in this field.",

    "abstract": "Prediction of an individual's race and ethnicity plays an important role in\nsocial science and public health research. Examples include studies of racial\ndisparity in health and voting. Recently, Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding\n(BISG), which uses Bayes' rule to combine information from Census surname files\nwith the geocoding of an individual's residence, has emerged as a leading\nmethodology for this prediction task. Unfortunately, BISG suffers from two\nCensus data problems that contribute to unsatisfactory predictive performance\nfor minorities. First, the decennial Census often contains zero counts for\nminority racial groups in the Census blocks where some members of those groups\nreside. Second, because the Census surname files only include frequent names,\nmany surnames -- especially those of minorities -- are missing from the list.\nTo address the zero counts problem, we introduce a fully Bayesian Improved\nSurname Geocoding (fBISG) methodology that accounts for potential measurement\nerror in Census counts by extending the na\\\"ive Bayesian inference of the BISG\nmethodology to full posterior inference. To address the missing surname\nproblem, we supplement the Census surname data with additional data on last,\nfirst, and middle names taken from the voter files of six Southern states where\nself-reported race is available. Our empirical validation shows that the fBISG\nmethodology and name supplements significantly improve the accuracy of race\nimputation across all racial groups, and especially for Asians.

However, MPI cannot provide information regarding associations\nand causal relations among poverty factors. Does education cause income\ninequality in a specific region? Is lacking education a cause of health issues?\nBy not knowing causal relations, policy maker cannot pinpoint root causes of\npoverty issues of a specific population, which might not be the same across\ndifferent population. Additionally, MPI requires binary data, which cannot be\nanalyzed by most of causal inference frameworks. In this work, we proposed an\nexploratory-data-analysis framework for finding possible causal relations with\nconfidence intervals among binary data. The proposed framework provides not\nonly how severe the issue of poverty is, but it also provides the causal\nrelations among poverty factors. Moreover, knowing a confidence interval of\ndegree of causal direction lets us know how strong a causal relation is.\nWe evaluated the proposed framework with several baseline approaches in\nsimulation datasets as well as using two real-world datasets as case studies 1)\nTwin births of the United States: the relation between birth weight and\nmortality of twin, and 2) Thailand population surveys from 378k households of\nChiang Mai and 353k households of Khon Kaen provinces.

The second case study reveals that smoking\nassociates with drinking alcohol in both provinces and there is a causal\nrelation of smoking causes drinking alcohol in only Chiang Mai province.

For such OFDM-based\ntransceivers, many core physical layer functions related to channel estimation,\ndemapping, and decoding are implemented for specific choices of channel types\nand modulation schemes, among others. To decouple hard-wired choices from the\nreceiver chain and thereby enhance the flexibility of IoT deployment in many\nnovel scenarios without changing the underlying hardware, we explore a novel,\nmodular Machine Learning (ML)-based receiver chain design. Here, ML blocks\nreplace the individual processing blocks of an OFDM receiver, and we\nspecifically describe this swapping for the legacy channel estimation, symbol\ndemapping, and decoding blocks with Neural Networks (NNs). A unique aspect of\nthis modular design is providing flexible allocation of processing functions to\nthe legacy or ML blocks, allowing them to interchangeably coexist. Furthermore,\nwe study the implementation cost-benefits of the proposed NNs in\nresource-constrained IoT devices through pruning and quantization, as well as\nemulation of these compressed NNs within Field Programmable Gate Arrays\n(FPGAs). Our evaluations demonstrate that the proposed modular NN-based\nreceiver improves bit error rate of the traditional non-ML receiver by\naveragely 61% and 10% for the simulated and over-the-air datasets,\nrespectively.

Unlike the square systems and\nnonsquare systems with fewer outputs than inputs, which can be completely\nlinearized, we consider the problem of linearizing nonsquare systems with more\noutputs than inputs. In particular, the system is linearized by decomposing the\nstate using a diffeomorphism, which is chosen such that the output of the\nsystem is a linear combination of the outputs of integrator chains, and the\ninput of the system is chosen to cancel the nonlinearities using feedback\nlinearization. In the case of nonsquare systems with more outputs than inputs,\nwe observe that the resulting linear system can be stabilized even though it is\nuncontrollable at all times. This apparent contradiction is due to the\nswitching behavior in the control action. We apply the input-output\nlinearization method to linearize the longitudinal aircraft dynamics and\ndemonstrate asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system despite the\nswitching behavior.",

Under forcing, even the single\npendulum may exhibit chaos, providing a simple example of a damped-driven\nsystem. All multi-armed pendulums are characterized by the existence of\nindex-one saddle points, which mediate the transport of trajectories in the\nsystem, providing a simple mechanical analog of various complex transport\nphenomena, from biolocomotion to transport within the solar system. Further,\npendulum systems have long been used to design and test both linear and\nnonlinear control strategies, with the addition of more arms making the problem\nmore challenging.
