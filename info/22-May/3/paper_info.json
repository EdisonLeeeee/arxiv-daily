    "abstract": "Having a rich multimodal inner language is an important component of human\nintelligence that enables several necessary core cognitive functions such as\nmultimodal prediction, translation, and generation. Building upon the Conscious\nTuring Machine (CTM), a machine model for consciousness as proposed by Blum and\nBlum (2021), we describe the desiderata of a multimodal language called\nBrainish, comprising words, images, audio, and sensations combined in\nrepresentations that the CTM's processors use to communicate with each other.\nWe define the syntax and semantics of Brainish before operationalizing this\nlanguage through the lens of multimodal artificial intelligence, a vibrant\nresearch area studying the computational tools necessary for processing and\nrelating information from heterogeneous signals. Our general framework for\nlearning Brainish involves designing (1) unimodal encoders to segment and\nrepresent unimodal data, (2) a coordinated representation space that relates\nand composes unimodal features to derive holistic meaning across multimodal\ninputs, and (3) decoders to map multimodal representations into predictions\n(for fusion) or raw data (for translation or generation). Through discussing\nhow Brainish is crucial for communication and coordination in order to achieve\nconsciousness in the CTM, and by implementing a simple version of Brainish and\nevaluating its capability of demonstrating intelligence on multimodal\nprediction and retrieval tasks on several real-world image, text, and audio\ndatasets, we argue that such an inner language will be important for advances\nin machine models of intelligence and consciousness.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: In contrast to current AI technology, natural intelligence --\nthe kind of autonomous intelligence that is realized in the brains of animals\nand humans to attain in their natural environment goals defined by a repertoire\nof innate behavioral schemata -- is far superior in terms of learning speed,\ngeneralization capabilities, autonomy and creativity. How are these strengths,\nby what means are ideas and imagination produced in natural neural networks?\nMethods: Reviewing the literature, we put forward the argument that both our\nnatural environment and the brain are of low complexity, that is, require for\ntheir generation very little information and are consequently both highly\nstructured. We further argue that the structures of brain and natural\nenvironment are closely related.\nResults: We propose that the structural regularity of the brain takes the\nform of net fragments (self-organized network patterns) and that these serve as\nthe powerful inductive bias that enables the brain to learn quickly, generalize\nfrom few examples and bridge the gap between abstractly defined general goals\nand concrete situations.\nConclusions: Our results have important bearings on open problems in\nartificial neural network research.",

In this paper, we explore the\nconsequences of this inherent lack of self-awareness towards impairing the\nmodel performance, ultimately resulting in both Type I and II errors over time.\nTo that end, we propose augmenting the Markov Graph construction with a\nsuperposition-based adjacency matrix. Here, our method leverages an induced\nstochasticity to reactively learn a locally-adaptive decision boundary based on\nthe performance of the individual rewrites in a bi-variate beta setting. We\nalso surface a data augmentation strategy that leverages template-based\ngeneration in abridging complex conversation hierarchies of dialogs so as to\nsimplify the learning process. All in all, we demonstrate that our self-aware\nmodel improves the overall PR-AUC by 27.45%, achieves a relative defect\nreduction of up to 31.22%, and is able to adapt quicker to changes in global\npreferences across a large number of customers.",

NER research typically focuses on the\ncreation of new ways of training NER, with relatively less emphasis on\nresources and evaluation. Further, state of the art (SOTA) NER models, trained\non standard datasets, typically report only a single performance measure\n(F-score) and we don't really know how well they do for different entity types\nand genres of text, or how robust are they to new, unseen entities. In this\npaper, we perform a broad evaluation of NER using a popular dataset, that takes\ninto consideration various text genres and sources constituting the dataset at\nhand. Additionally, we generate six new adversarial test sets through small\nperturbations in the original test set, replacing select entities while\nretaining the context. We also train and test our models on randomly generated\ntrain/dev/test splits followed by an experiment where the models are trained on\na select set of genres but tested genres not seen in training. These\ncomprehensive evaluation strategies were performed using three SOTA NER models.\nBased on our results, we recommend some useful reporting practices for NER\nresearchers, that could help in providing a better understanding of a SOTA\nmodel's performance in future.",

    "abstract": "Prior research on exposure fairness in the context of recommender systems has\nfocused mostly on disparities in the exposure of individual or groups of items\nto individual users of the system. The problem of how individual or groups of\nitems may be systemically under or over exposed to groups of users, or even all\nusers, has received relatively less attention. However, such systemic\ndisparities in information exposure can result in observable social harms, such\nas withholding economic opportunities from historically marginalized groups\n(allocative harm) or amplifying gendered and racialized stereotypes\n(representational harm). Previously, Diaz et al. developed the expected\nexposure metric -- that incorporates existing user browsing models that have\npreviously been developed for information retrieval -- to study fairness of\ncontent exposure to individual users. We extend their proposed framework to\nformalize a family of exposure fairness metrics that model the problem jointly\nfrom the perspective of both the consumers and producers. Specifically, we\nconsider group attributes for both types of stakeholders to identify and\nmitigate fairness concerns that go beyond individual users and items towards\nmore systemic biases in recommendation. Furthermore, we study and discuss the\nrelationships between the different exposure fairness dimensions proposed in\nthis paper, as well as demonstrate how stochastic ranking policies can be\noptimized towards said fairness goals.",

    "abstract": "One of the most impressive results of recent NLP history is the ability of\npre-trained language models to solve new tasks in a zero-shot setting. To\nachieve this, NLP tasks are framed as natural language prompts, generating a\nresponse indicating the predicted output.

In this paper, we explore methods to utilize\nunlabeled data to improve zero-shot performance.

Our method makes it possible to\nfine-tune the model either with extra unlabeled training data, or directly on\ntest input at inference time in an unsupervised manner. In experiments, our\napproach outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot learner, T0 (Sanh et al.,\n2022), on 9 out of 11 datasets across 4 NLP tasks by up to 10.6 absolute points\nin terms of accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach,\ncalled ROKI, that accurately tracks internal resource utilization and\nallocation associated with each packet (or session), making it possible to tame\nresource exhaustion caused by {\\mu}DoS attacks. Since ROKI focuses on capturing\nthe symptom of DoS, it can effectively mitigate previously unknown {\\mu}DoS\nattacks. To enable a finer-grain resource tracking, ROKI provided in concept\nthe accounting capabilities to each packet itself, so we called data-driven: it\nmonitors resource utilization at the link, network, transport layers in the\nkernel, as well as application layers, and attributes back to the associated\npacket. Given the resource usages of each packet, ROKI can reclaim (or prevent)\nthe system resources from malicious packets (or attackers) whenever it\nencounters system-wide resource exhaustion. To provide lightweight resource\ntracking, ROKI carefully multiplexes hardware performance counters whenever\nnecessary. Our evaluation shows that ROKI's approach is indeed effective in\nmitigating real-world {\\mu}DoS attacks with negligible performance overheads -\nincurring 3%-4% throughput and latency overheads on average when the system is\nthrottled.",

In this\npaper, we explore the efficacy of audio-visual self-supervised learning from\nuncurated long-form content i.e movies. Studying its differences with\nconventional short-form content, we identify a non-i.i.d distribution of data,\ndriven by the nature of movies. Specifically, we find long-form content to\nnaturally contain a diverse set of semantic concepts (semantic diversity),\nwhere a large portion of them, such as main characters and environments often\nreappear frequently throughout the movie (reoccurring semantic concepts). In\naddition, movies often contain content-exclusive artistic artifacts, such as\ncolor palettes or thematic music, which are strong signals for uniquely\ndistinguishing a movie (non-semantic consistency). Capitalizing on these\nobservations, we comprehensively study the effect of emphasizing within-movie\nnegative sampling in a contrastive learning setup. Our view is different from\nthose of prior works who consider within-video positive sampling, inspired by\nthe notion of semantic persistency over time, and operate in a short-video\nregime.

This paper also accounts for the\nmonthly and annual demand charges based on realistic utility tariffs.\nFurthermore, BESS life degradation is considered in the model to ensure no\nreplacement is needed during the considered planning horizon. Different from\nthe literature, this paper offers pragmatic MILP formulations to tally BESS\ncharge/discharge cycles using the cumulative charge/discharge energy concept.\nMcCormick relaxations and the Big-M method are utilized to relax the bi-linear\nterms in the BESS operational constraints. Finally, a robust optimization-based\nMILP model is proposed and leveraged to account for uncertainties in\nelectricity price, solar generation, and XFCS demand. Case studies were\nperformed to signify the efficacy of the proposed formulations.",

    "abstract": "Many human pose estimation methods estimate Skinned Multi-Person Linear\n(SMPL) models and regress the human joints from these SMPL estimates. In this\nwork, we show that the most widely used SMPL-to-joint linear layer (joint\nregressor) is inaccurate, which may mislead pose evaluation results. To achieve\na more accurate joint regressor, we propose a method to create\npseudo-ground-truth SMPL poses, which can then be used to train an improved\nregressor. Specifically, we optimize SMPL estimates coming from a\nstate-of-the-art method so that its projection matches the silhouettes of\nhumans in the scene, as well as the ground-truth 2D joint locations. While the\nquality of this pseudo-ground-truth is challenging to assess due to the lack of\nactual ground-truth SMPL, with the Human 3.6m dataset, we qualitatively show\nthat our joint locations are more accurate and that our regressor leads to\nimproved pose estimations results on the test set without any need for\nretraining.

The key to this result is the consideration of\nthis enumeration problem on 2-degenerate graphs, which is proven to be possible\nin time $\\mathcal{O}(1.9767^n)$. We also show new lower bound results by\nconstructing a family of graphs of order $n$ with $\\Omega(1.4890^n)$ minimal\nconnected dominating sets, while previous examples achieved $\\Omega(1.4422^n)$.\nOur construction results in lower bounds for a few special graph classes.\nWe also address essential questions concerning output-sensitive enumeration.\nNamely, we give reasons why our algorithm cannot be turned into an enumeration\nalgorithm that guarantees polynomial delay without much efforts. More\nprecisely, we prove that it is NP-complete to decide, given a graph $G$ and a\nvertex set $U$, if there exists a minimal connected dominating set $D$ with\n$U\\subseteq D$, even if $G$ is known to be 2-degenerate. Our reduction also\nshows that even any subexponential delay is not easy to achieve for enumerating\nminimal connected dominating sets. Another reduction shows that no\nFPT-algorithms can be expected for this extension problem concerning minimal\nconnected dominating sets, parameterized by $|U|$. We also relate our\nenumeration problem to the famous open Hitting Set Transversal problem, which\ncan be phrased in our context as the question to enumerate all minimal\ndominating sets of a graph with polynomial delay by showing that a\npolynomial-delay enumeration algorithm for minimal connected dominating sets\nimplies an affirmative algorithmic solution to the Hitting Set Transversal\nproblem.",

    "abstract": "The ground truth for cascading failure in power system can only be obtained\nthrough a detailed dynamic model involving nonlinear differential and algebraic\nequations whose solution process is computationally expensive. This has\nprohibited adoption of such models for cascading failure simulation. To solve\nthis, we propose a fast cascading failure simulation approach based on implicit\nBackward Euler method (BEM) with stiff decay property. Unfortunately, BEM\nsuffers from hyperstability issue in case of oscillatory instability and\nconverges to the unstable equilibrium. We propose a predictor-corrector\napproach to fully address the hyperstability issue in BEM. The predictor\nidentifies oscillatory instability based on eigendecomposition of the system\nmatrix at the post-disturbance unstable equilibrium obtained as a byproduct of\nBEM. The corrector uses right eigenvectors to identify the group of machines\nparticipating in the unstable mode. This helps in applying appropriate\nprotection schemes as in ground truth. We use Trapezoidal method (TM)-based\nsimulation as the benchmark to validate the results of the proposed approach on\nthe IEEE 118-bus network, 2,383-bus Polish grid, and IEEE 68-bus system. The\nproposed approach is able to track the cascade path and replicate the end\nresults of TM-based simulation with very high accuracy while reducing the\naverage simulation time by approximately 10-35 fold.

In this paper, we decouple the\ntwo issues via robust stochastic model aggregation, in the sense that our\nproposed DP mechanisms and the defense against Byzantine attacks have separated\ninfluence on the learning performance. Leveraging robust stochastic model\naggregation, at each iteration, each worker calculates the difference between\nthe local model and the global one, followed by sending the element-wise signs\nto the master node, which enables robustness to Byzantine attacks. Further, we\ndesign two DP mechanisms to perturb the uploaded signs for the purpose of\nprivacy preservation, and prove that they are $(\\epsilon,0)$-DP by exploiting\nthe properties of noise distributions. With the tools of Moreau envelop and\nproximal point projection, we establish the convergence of the proposed\nalgorithm when the cost function is nonconvex.

    "title": "Gaze-enhanced Crossmodal Embeddings for Emotion Recognition",
    "abstract": "Emotional expressions are inherently multimodal -- integrating facial\nbehavior, speech, and gaze -- but their automatic recognition is often limited\nto a single modality, e.g. speech during a phone call. While previous work\nproposed crossmodal emotion embeddings to improve monomodal recognition\nperformance, despite its importance, an explicit representation of gaze was not\nincluded. We propose a new approach to emotion recognition that incorporates an\nexplicit representation of gaze in a crossmodal emotion embedding framework. We\nshow that our method outperforms the previous state of the art for both\naudio-only and video-only emotion classification on the popular One-Minute\nGradual Emotion Recognition dataset. Furthermore, we report extensive ablation\nexperiments and provide detailed insights into the performance of different\nstate-of-the-art gaze representations and integration strategies. Our results\nnot only underline the importance of gaze for emotion recognition but also\ndemonstrate a practical and highly effective approach to leveraging gaze\ninformation for this task.",

    "title": "Learn to Understand Negation in Video Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Negation is a common linguistic skill that allows human to express what we do\nNOT want. Naturally, one might expect video retrieval to support\nnatural-language queries with negation, e.g., finding shots of kids sitting on\nthe floor and not playing with the dog. However, the state-of-the-art deep\nlearning based video retrieval models lack such ability, as they are typically\ntrained on video description datasets such as MSR-VTT and VATEX that lack\nnegated descriptions. Their retrieved results basically ignore the negator in\nthe sample query, incorrectly returning videos showing kids playing with the\ndog. In this paper, we present the first study on learning to understand\nnegation in video retrieval and make contributions as follows. First, by\nre-purposing two existing datasets, i.e. MSR-VTT and VATEX, we propose a new\nevaluation protocol for testing video retrieval with negation. Second, we\npropose a learning based method for training a negation-aware video retrieval\nmodel. The key idea is to first construct a soft negative caption for a\nspecific training video by partially negating its original caption, and then\ncompute a bidirectionally constrained loss on the triplet. This auxiliary loss\nis then weightedly added to a standard retrieval loss. Experiments on the\nre-purposed benchmarks show that re-training the CLIP (Contrastive\nLanguage-Image Pre-Training) model by the proposed method clearly improves its\nability to handle queries with negation. In addition, its performance on the\noriginal benchmarks is also improved. Data and source code will be released.",

    "abstract": "Automatic font generation remains a challenging research issue due to the\nlarge amounts of characters with complicated structures. Typically, only a few\nsamples can serve as the style/content reference (termed few-shot learning),\nwhich further increases the difficulty to preserve local style patterns or\ndetailed glyph structures. We investigate the drawbacks of previous studies and\nfind that a coarse-grained discriminator is insufficient for supervising a font\ngenerator. To this end, we propose a novel Component-Aware Module (CAM), which\nsupervises the generator to decouple content and style at a more fine-grained\nlevel, \\textit{i.e.}, the component level. Different from previous studies\nstruggling to increase the complexity of generators, we aim to perform more\neffective supervision for a relatively simple generator to achieve its full\npotential, which is a brand new perspective for font generation. The whole\nframework achieves remarkable results by coupling component-level supervision\nwith adversarial learning, hence we call it Component-Guided GAN, shortly\nCG-GAN. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art one-shot font generation methods.

    "abstract": "Autonomous systems (AS) often use Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifiers to\nallow them to operate in complex, high dimensional, non-linear, and dynamically\nchanging environments. Due to the complexity of these environments, DNN\nclassifiers may output misclassifications due to experiencing new tasks in\ntheir operational environments, which were not identified during development.\nRemoving a system from operation and retraining it to include the new\nidentified task becomes economically infeasible as the number of such\nautonomous systems increase. Additionally, such misclassifications may cause\nfinancial losses and safety threats to the AS or to other operators in its\nenvironment. In this paper, we propose to reduce such threats by investigating\nif DNN classifiers can adapt its knowledge to learn new information in the AS's\noperational environment, using only a limited number of observations\nencountered sequentially during operation. This allows the AS to adapt to new\nencountered information and hence increases the AS's reliability on doing\ncorrect classifications. However, retraining DNNs on different observations\nthan used in prior training is known to cause catastrophic forgetting or\nsignificant model drift. We investigate if this problem can be controlled by\nusing Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) whilst learning from limited new\nobservations. We carry out experiments using original and noisy versions of the\nMNIST dataset to represent known and new information to DNN classifiers.\nResults show that using EWC does make the process of adaptation to new\ninformation a lot more controlled, and thus allowing for reliable adaption of\nASs to new information in their operational environment.",

In\naddition, to understand how existing MOT algorithms perform on AnimalTrack and\nprovide baselines for future comparison, we extensively evaluate 14\nstate-of-the-art representative trackers. The evaluation results demonstrate\nthat, not surprisingly, most of these trackers become degenerated due to the\ndifferences between pedestrians and animals in various aspects (e.g., pose,\nmotion, appearance, etc), and more efforts are desired to improve multi-animal\ntracking.

So far, our understanding of the learning behavior of DNNs\ntrained by noisy segmentation labels remains limited. In this study, we address\nthis deficiency in both binary segmentation of biological microscopy images and\nmulti-class segmentation of natural images. We classify segmentation labels\naccording to their noise transition matrices (NTM) and compare performance of\nDNNs trained by different types of labels. When we randomly sample a small\nfraction (e.g., 10%) or flipping a large fraction (e.g., 90%) of the\nground-truth labels to train DNNs, their segmentation performance remains\nlargely the same. This indicates that DNNs learn structures hidden in labels\nrather than pixel-level labels per se in their supervised training for semantic\nsegmentation. We call these hidden structures \"meta-structures\". When we use\nlabels with different perturbations to the meta-structures to train DNNs, their\nperformance in feature extraction and segmentation degrades consistently. In\ncontrast, addition of meta-structure information substantially improves\nperformance of an unsupervised model in binary semantic segmentation. We\nformulate meta-structures mathematically as spatial density distributions and\nquantify semantic information of different types of labels, which we find to\ncorrelate strongly with ranks of their NTM.

    "abstract": "Deep Ensemble (DE) is an effective alternative to Bayesian neural networks\nfor uncertainty quantification in deep learning. The uncertainty of DE is\nusually conveyed by the functional inconsistency among the ensemble members,\nsay, the disagreement among their predictions. Yet, the functional\ninconsistency stems from unmanageable randomness and may easily collapse in\nspecific cases. To render the uncertainty of DE reliable, we propose a\nrefinement of DE where the functional inconsistency is explicitly\ncharacterized, and further tuned w.r.t. the training data and certain priori\nbeliefs. Specifically, we describe the functional inconsistency with the\nempirical covariance of the functions dictated by ensemble members, which,\nalong with the mean, define a Gaussian process (GP). Then, with specific priori\nuncertainty imposed, we maximize functional evidence lower bound to make the GP\nspecified by DE approximate the Bayesian posterior. In this way, we relate DE\nto Bayesian inference to enjoy reliable Bayesian uncertainty. Moreover, we\nprovide strategies to make the training efficient. Our approach consumes only\nmarginally added training cost than the standard DE, but achieves better\nuncertainty quantification than DE and its variants across diverse scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning provides a privacy guarantee for generating good deep\nlearning models on distributed clients with different kinds of data.\nNevertheless, dealing with non-IID data is one of the most challenging problems\nfor federated learning. Researchers have proposed a variety of methods to\neliminate the negative influence of non-IIDness. However, they only focus on\nthe non-IID data provided that the universal class distribution is balanced. In\nmany real-world applications, the universal class distribution is long-tailed,\nwhich causes the model seriously biased. Therefore, this paper studies the\njoint problem of non-IID and long-tailed data in federated learning and\nproposes a corresponding solution called Federated Ensemble Distillation with\nImbalance Calibration (FEDIC). To deal with non-IID data, FEDIC uses model\nensemble to take advantage of the diversity of models trained on non-IID data.\nThen, a new distillation method with logit adjustment and calibration gating\nnetwork is proposed to solve the long-tail problem effectively. We evaluate\nFEDIC on CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, and ImageNet-LT with a highly non-IID\nexperimental setting, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods of\nfederated learning and long-tail learning.

However, tradtional quantization methods (such as\nquantization aware training and post training quantization) require original\ndata for the fine-tuning or calibration of quantized model, which makes them\ninapplicable to the cases that original data are not accessed due to privacy or\nsecurity. This gives birth to the data-free quantization with synthetic data\ngeneration. While current DFQ methods still suffer from severe performance\ndegradation when quantizing a model into lower bit, caused by the low\ninter-class separability of semantic features. To this end, we propose a new\nand effective data-free quantization method termed ClusterQ, which utilizes the\nsemantic feature distribution alignment for synthetic data generation. To\nobtain high inter-class separability of semantic features, we cluster and align\nthe feature distribution statistics to imitate the distribution of real data,\nso that the performance degradation is alleviated. Moreover, we incorporate the\nintra-class variance to solve class-wise mode collapse.

Context can also be important in deep\nlearning-based program repair to provide extra information about the bug and\nits fix. Existing techniques, however, treat context in an arbitrary manner, by\nextracting code in close proximity of the buggy statement within the enclosing\nfile, class, or method, without any analysis to find actual relations with the\nbug. To reduce noise, they use a predefined maximum limit on the number of\ntokens to be used as context. We present a program slicing-based approach, in\nwhich instead of arbitrarily including code as context, we analyze statements\nthat have a control or data dependency on the buggy statement. We propose a\nnovel concept called dual slicing, which leverages the context of both buggy\nand fixed versions of the code to capture relevant repair ingredients.

The spectral element method is used to discretize\nthe spatial fluid domain, whereas the classical explicit 4-stage 4th order\nRunge-Kutta scheme is employed for the temporal integration.

The results are showing excellent agreement,\nultimately validating the solver and emphasizing the geometrical flexibility\nand high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed solver strategy. Lastly, an\nextensive investigation of non-resolved energy from the pseudo-impulse is\ncarried out to characterise the induced spurious oscillations of the free\nsurface quantities leading to a verification of a proposal on how to\nefficiently and accurately calculate added mass and damping coefficients in\npseudo-impulsive solvers.",

For example, Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMIs), which\nconsist of physical meters that collect usage data about public utilities such\nas power and water, are an important building block in a smart city. In a\ntypical sensor network, the measurement devices are connected through a\ncomputer network, which exposes them to cyber attacks. Furthermore, the data is\ncentrally managed at the operator's servers, making it vulnerable to insider\nthreats.\nOur goal is to protect the integrity of data collected by large-scale sensor\nnetworks and the firmware in measurement devices from cyber attacks and insider\nthreats. To this end, we first develop a comprehensive threat model for attacks\nagainst data and firmware integrity, which can target any of the stakeholders\nin the operation of the sensor network. Next, we use our threat model to\nanalyze existing defense mechanisms, including signature checks, remote\nfirmware attestation, anomaly detection, and blockchain-based secure logs.\nHowever, the large size of the Trusted Computing Base and a lack of scalability\nlimit the applicability of these existing mechanisms.

    "abstract": "This article investigates physical layer security (PLS) in reconfigurable\nintelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output\nmultiple-antenna-eavesdropper (MIMOME) channels. Existing researches ignore the\nproblem that secrecy rate can not be calculated if the eavesdropper's\ninstantaneous channel state information (CSI) is unknown. Furthermore, without\nthe secrecy rate expression, beamforming and phase shifter optimization with\nthe purpose of PLS enhancement is not available. To address these problems, we\nfirst give the expression of secrecy outage probability for any beamforming\nvector and phase shifter matrix as the RIS-assisted PLS metric, which is\nmeasured based on the eavesdropper's statistical CSI. Then, with the aid of the\nexpression, we formulate the minimization problem of secrecy outage probability\nthat is solved via alternately optimizing beamforming vectors and phase shift\nmatrices. In the case of single-antenna transmitter or single-antenna\nlegitimate receiver, the proposed alternating optimization (AO) scheme can be\nsimplified to reduce computational complexity. Finally, it is demonstrated that\nthe secrecy outage probability is significantly reduced with the proposed\nmethods compared to current RIS-assisted PLS systems.",

    "abstract": "While the deep learning techniques promote the rapid development of the\nspeech enhancement (SE) community, most schemes only pursue the performance in\na black-box manner and lack adequate model interpretability. Inspired by\nTaylor's approximation theory, we propose an interpretable decoupling-style SE\nframework, which disentangles the complex spectrum recovery into two separate\noptimization problems \\emph{i.e.}, magnitude and complex residual estimation.\nSpecifically, serving as the 0th-order term in Taylor's series, a filter\nnetwork is delicately devised to suppress the noise component only in the\nmagnitude domain and obtain a coarse spectrum. To refine the phase\ndistribution, we estimate the sparse complex residual, which is defined as the\ndifference between target and coarse spectra, and measures the phase gap. In\nthis study, we formulate the residual component as the combination of various\nhigh-order Taylor terms and propose a lightweight trainable module to replace\nthe complicated derivative operator between adjacent terms. Finally, following\nTaylor's formula, we can reconstruct the target spectrum by the superimposition\nbetween 0th-order and high-order terms. Experimental results on two benchmark\ndatasets show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance over\nprevious competing baselines in various evaluation metrics.

However, one obvious deficiency for the existing CGEC\nevaluation system is that the evaluation values are significantly influenced by\nthe Chinese word segmentation results or different language models. The\nevaluation values of the same error correction model can vary considerably\nunder different word segmentation systems or different language models.\nHowever, it is expected that these metrics should be independent of the word\nsegmentation results and language models, as they may lead to a lack of\nuniqueness and comparability in the evaluation of different methods. To this\nend, we propose three novel evaluation metrics for CGEC in two dimensions:\nreference-based and reference-less. In terms of the reference-based metric, we\nintroduce sentence-level accuracy and char-level BLEU to evaluate the corrected\nsentences. Besides, in terms of the reference-less metric, we adopt char-level\nmeaning preservation to measure the semantic preservation degree of the\ncorrected sentences.

In this paper, channel measurement campaigns\nin indoor scenarios at 201-209~GHz are reported. Four different communication\nscenarios including 90 transmitter-receiver pairs are measured in two channel\nmeasurement campaigns of a meeting room and an office room, respectively. The\ntwo measurement campaigns contains four scenarios, namely, a meeting room,\ncubicle area, hallway and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) case. The propagation of\nmulti-path components (MPCs) in the four scenarios is characterized by the\npower-delay-angular profiles. Based on them, the temporal and spatial\nconsistency for varying receiver locations in the complex hallway and NLoS\nscenarios are verified. To characterize, the large-scale best-direction and\nomni-directional path losses in indoor scenarios are separately analyzed and\nmodeled by the close-in (CI) model. Furthermore, the small-scale channel\nparameters, e.g., the number of clusters, delay spread, angular spread, and\ncluster time-of-arrival are analyzed and modeled by proper distributions. As a\ngeneral framework, a ray-tracing-statistical hybrid model is proposed for\nwireless propagation at 201-209~GHz, although, admittedly, the measurement\nresults and analysis reveal that the channel characteristics in various indoor\nscenarios exhibit noticeable differences that need tailored parameter settings.",

    "abstract": "We identify and demonstrate a weakness of Petri Nets (PN) in specifying\ncomplex behavior. Specifically, we show how, when specifying multiple\nrequirements in one Petri net model, modelers are obliged to specify mechanisms\nfor combining these requirements. This yields, in many cases,\nover-specification and incorrect models. We demonstrate how some execution\npaths are missed, and some are generated unintentionally. To support this\nclaim, we analyze Petri net models from the literature, identify the\ncombination mechanisms, and demonstrate their effect on the correctness of the\nmodel. To address this problem, we propose to model the system behavior using\nbehavioral programming (BP), a software development and modeling paradigm\ndesigned for seamless integration of independent requirements. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate how the semantics of BP, which define how to interweave scenarios\ninto a single model, allow avoiding the over-specification. Additionally, while\nBP maintains the same mathematical properties as PN, it provides means for\nchanging the model dynamically, thus increasing the agility of the\nspecification. We compare BP and PN in quantitative and qualitative measures by\nanalyzing the models, their generated execution paths, and the specification\nprocess. Finally, while BP is supported by tools that allow for applying formal\nmethods and reasoning techniques to the model, it lacks the legacy of PN tools\nand algorithms. To address this issue, we propose semantics and a tool for\ntranslating BP models to PN and vice versa.",

Each of these categories appears to capture different\ncharacteristics of relevance. Previous work has investigated how relevance\nsignals from sparse retrievers could be combined with those from dense\nretrievers via interpolation. Such interpolation would generally lead to higher\nretrieval effectiveness. In this paper we consider the problem of combining the\nrelevance signals from sparse and dense retrievers in the context of Pseudo\nRelevance Feedback (PRF). This context poses two key challenges: (1) When\nshould interpolation occur: before, after, or both before and after the PRF\nprocess? (2) Which sparse representation should be considered: a zero-shot\nbag-of-words model (BM25), or a learnt sparse representation? To answer these\nquestions we perform a thorough empirical evaluation considering an effective\nand scalable neural PRF approach (Vector-PRF), three effective dense retrievers\n(ANCE, TCTv2, DistillBERT), and one state-of-the-art learnt sparse retriever\n(uniCOIL).

    "title": "A Two-Stream AMR-enhanced Model for Document-level Event Argument  Extraction",
    "abstract": "Most previous studies aim at extracting events from a single sentence, while\ndocument-level event extraction still remains under-explored. In this paper, we\nfocus on extracting event arguments from an entire document, which mainly faces\ntwo critical problems: a) the long-distance dependency between trigger and\narguments over sentences; b) the distracting context towards an event in the\ndocument. To address these issues, we propose a Two-Stream Abstract meaning\nRepresentation enhanced extraction model (TSAR). TSAR encodes the document from\ndifferent perspectives by a two-stream encoding module, to utilize local and\nglobal information and lower the impact of distracting context. Besides, TSAR\nintroduces an AMR-guided interaction module to capture both intra-sentential\nand inter-sentential features, based on the locally and globally constructed\nAMR semantic graphs. An auxiliary boundary loss is introduced to enhance the\nboundary information for text spans explicitly. Extensive experiments\nillustrate that TSAR outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large margin,\nwith 2.54 F1 and 5.13 F1 performance gain on the public RAMS and WikiEvents\ndatasets respectively, showing the superiority in the cross-sentence arguments\nextraction.

    "abstract": "In automotive power electronics, distortion and electromagnetic interference\n(EMI) generated by the switching action of power semiconductors can be a\nsignificant challenge for the design of a compact, lightweight vehicle. As\nsemiconductor switching frequencies increase, e.g., through the introduction of\nnew materials, such as gallium nitride and silicon carbide, this problem\nbecomes more severe. We present a control scheme for an automotive dc-to-dc\nconverter that reduces the EMI generated by shaping switching distortion\npredictively at the run time. The multistep model-predictive control scheme\nchooses the subsequent switching state that optimizes the output spectrum\naccording to predefined criteria. To achieve real-time operation, it evaluates\nthe possible switching state candidates for the next modulation step without\nexplicitly solving a single Fourier transform. In addition, the switching rate\nand voltage ripple are controlled in a single unified control law. We present\nand experimentally validate that the control scheme can indeed run at real time\nalready with currently available mid-range hardware. The results demonstrate\nthat the largest spectral peak of the switching distortion can be decreased by\n48 dB compared to conventional pulse-width modulation. Furthermore, spectral\ngaps can be implemented in the output distortion and altered in real-time,\nallowing certain frequency bands -- e.g., bands used by other sensitive\nelectronics such as sensors, communication busses, or tuners -- to be kept free\nof EMI from the converter's switching actions.",

Ke Jie is invincible in the world championship--can\nhe still win the title this time? Go is one of the most popular board games in\nEast Asia, with a stable professional sports system that has lasted for decades\nin China, Japan, and Korea. There are mature data-driven analysis technologies\nfor many sports, such as soccer, basketball, and esports. However, developing\nsuch technology for Go remains nontrivial and challenging due to the lack of\ndatasets, meta-information, and in-game statistics. This paper creates the\nProfessional Go Dataset (PGD), containing 98,043 games played by 2,148\nprofessional players from 1950 to 2021. After manual cleaning and labeling, we\nprovide detailed meta-information for each player, game, and tournament.\nMoreover, the dataset includes analysis results for each move in the match\nevaluated by advanced AlphaZero-based AI. To establish a benchmark for PGD, we\nfurther analyze the data and extract meaningful in-game features based on prior\nknowledge related to Go that can indicate the game status. With the help of\ncomplete meta-information and constructed in-game features, our results\nprediction system achieves an accuracy of 75.30%, much higher than several\nstate-of-the-art approaches (64%-65%). As far as we know, PGD is the first\ndataset for data-driven analytics in Go and even in board games. Beyond this\npromising result, we provide more examples of tasks that benefit from our\ndataset. The ultimate goal of this paper is to bridge this ancient game and the\nmodern data science community. It will advance research on Go-related analytics\nto enhance the fan experience, help players improve their ability, and\nfacilitate other promising aspects.

Employing the\nsame spectrum resource, a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) dual-functional\nradar-communication (DFRC) base station detects the radar-centric user\n(R-user), while transmitting mixed multicast-unicast messages both to the\nR-user and to the communication-centric user (C-user). In particular, the\nmulticast information is intended for both the R- and C-users, whereas the\nunicast information is only intended for the C-user. More explicitly, NOMA is\nemployed to facilitate this double spectrum sharing, where the multicast and\nunicast signals are superimposed in the power domain and the superimposed\ncommunication signals are also exploited as radar probing waveforms. A\nbeamformer-based NOMA-aided joint Rad-MU-Com framework is proposed for the\nsystem having a single R-user and a single C-user. Based on this framework, the\nunicast rate maximization problem is formulated by optimizing the beamformers\nemployed, while satisfying the rate requirement of multicast and the predefined\naccuracy of the radar beam pattern.

Most existing HGNN-based\napproaches are supervised or semi-supervised learning methods requiring graphs\nto be annotated, which is costly and time-consuming. Self-supervised\ncontrastive learning has been proposed to address the problem of requiring\nannotated data by mining intrinsic information hidden within the given data.\nHowever, the existing contrastive learning methods are inadequate for\nheterogeneous graphs because they construct contrastive views only based on\ndata perturbation or pre-defined structural properties (e.g., meta-path) in\ngraph data while ignore the noises that may exist in both node attributes and\ngraph topologies. We develop for the first time a novel and robust\nheterogeneous graph contrastive learning approach, namely HGCL, which\nintroduces two views on respective guidance of node attributes and graph\ntopologies and integrates and enhances them by reciprocally contrastive\nmechanism to better model heterogeneous graphs. In this new approach, we adopt\ndistinct but most suitable attribute and topology fusion mechanisms in the two\nviews, which are conducive to mining relevant information in attributes and\ntopologies separately. We further use both attribute similarity and topological\ncorrelation to construct high-quality contrastive samples.

In practice, the\nsemantic information is defined by the pragmatic task of the receiver and\ncannot be known to the transmitter. The actual observable data at the\ntransmitter can also have non-identical distribution with the empirical data in\nthe shared background knowledge library. To address these practical issues,\nthis paper proposes a new neural network-based semantic communication system\nfor image transmission, where the task is unaware at the transmitter and the\ndata environment is dynamic. The system consists of two main parts, namely the\nsemantic extraction (SE) network and the data adaptation (DA) network. The SE\nnetwork learns how to extract the semantic information using a receiver-leading\ntraining process. By using domain adaptation technique from transfer learning,\nthe DA network learns how to convert the data observed into a similar form of\nthe empirical data that the SE network can process without re-training.\nNumerical experiments show that the proposed method can be adaptive to\nobservable datasets while keeping high performance in terms of both data\nrecovery and task execution.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel end-to-end curriculum learning approach that leverages\nlarge volumes of unlabelled great ape camera trap footage to improve supervised\nspecies detector construction in challenging real-world jungle environments. In\ncontrast to previous semi-supervised methods, our approach gradually improves\ndetection quality by steering training towards virtuous self-reinforcement. To\nachieve this, we propose integrating pseudo-labelling with dynamic curriculum\nlearning policies. We show that such dynamics and controls can avoid learning\ncollapse and gradually tie detector adjustments to higher model quality. We\nprovide theoretical arguments and ablations, and confirm significant\nperformance improvements against various state-of-the-art systems when\nevaluating on the Extended PanAfrican Dataset holding several thousand camera\ntrap videos of great apes. We note that system performance is strongest for\nsmaller labelled ratios, which are common in ecological applications. Our\napproach, although designed with wildlife data in mind, also shows competitive\nbenchmarks for generic object detection in the MS-COCO dataset, indicating\nwider applicability of introduced concepts.

    "abstract": "Let $P$ be a set of $n$ colored points. We develop efficient data structures\nthat store $P$ and can answer chromatic $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) queries.\nSuch a query consists of a query point $q$ and a number $k$, and asks for the\ncolor that appears most frequently among the $k$ points in $P$ closest to $q$.\nAnswering such queries efficiently is the key to obtain fast $k$-NN\nclassifiers. Our main aim is to obtain query times that are independent of $k$\nwhile using near-linear space.\nWe show that this is possible using a combination of two data structures. The\nfirst data structure allow us to compute a region containing exactly the\n$k$-nearest neighbors of a query point $q$, and the second data structure can\nthen report the most frequent color in such a region. This leads to linear\nspace data structures with query times of $O(n^{1 / 2} \\log n)$ for points in\n$\\mathbb{R}^1$, and with query times varying between $O(n^{2/3}\\log^{2/3} n)$\nand $O(n^{5/6} {\\rm polylog} n)$, depending on the distance measure used, for\npoints in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Since these query times are still fairly large we\nalso consider approximations. If we are allowed to report a color that appears\nat least $(1-\\varepsilon)f^*$ times, where $f^*$ is the frequency of the most\nfrequent color, we obtain a query time of $O(\\log n +\n\\log\\log_{\\frac{1}{1-\\varepsilon}} n)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^1$ and expected query\ntimes ranging between $\\tilde{O}(n^{1/2}\\varepsilon^{-3/2})$ and\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{1/2}\\varepsilon^{-5/2})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ using near-linear\nspace (ignoring polylogarithmic factors).",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is a loss in cognitive or physical performance due to various\nphysiological factors such as insufficient sleep, long work hours, stress, and\nphysical exertion. It has an adverse effect on the human body and can slow down\nreaction times, reduce attention, and limit short-term memory. Hence, there is\na need to monitor a person's state to avoid extreme fatigue conditions that can\nresult in physiological complications. However, tools to understand and assess\nfatigue are minimal. This paper first focuses on building an experimental setup\nthat induces cognitive fatigue (CF) and physical fatigue (PF) through multiple\ncognitive and physical tasks while simultaneously recording physiological data.\nSecond, self-reported visual analog scores (VAS) from the participants are\nreported after each task to confirm fatigue induction. Finally, an evaluation\nsystem is built that utilizes machine learning (ML) models to detect states of\nCF and PF from sensor data, thus providing an objective measure. Random Forest\nperforms the best in detecting PF with an accuracy of 80.5% while correctly\npredicting the true PF condition 88% of the time. On the other hand, the long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network produces the best results in\ndetecting CF in the subjects (with 84.1% accuracy, 0.9 recall).",

Conventional 2D lane detection from a monocular\nimage yields poor performance of following planning and control tasks in\nautonomous driving due to the case of uneven road. Predicting the 3D lane\nlayout is thus necessary and enables effective and safe driving. However,\nexisting 3D lane detection datasets are either unpublished or synthesized from\na simulated environment, severely hampering the development of this field. In\nthis paper, we take steps towards addressing these issues. By exploiting the\nexplicit relationship between point clouds and image pixels, a dataset\nannotation pipeline is designed to automatically generate high-quality 3D lane\nlocations from 2D lane annotations in 211K road scenes. In addition, we present\nan extrinsic-free, anchor-free method, called SALAD, regressing the 3D\ncoordinates of lanes in image view without converting the feature map into the\nbird's-eye view (BEV). To facilitate future research on 3D lane detection, we\nbenchmark the dataset and provide a novel evaluation metric, performing\nextensive experiments of both existing approaches and our proposed method. The\naim of our work is to revive the interest of 3D lane detection in a real-world\nscenario.

    "abstract": "As deep learning advances, there is an ever-growing demand for models capable\nof synthesizing information from multi-modal resources to address the complex\ntasks raised from real-life applications. Recently, many large multi-modal\ndatasets have been collected, on which researchers actively explore different\nmethods of fusing multi-modal information. However, little attention has been\npaid to quantifying the contribution of different modalities within the\nproposed models. In this paper, we propose the {\\bf SH}apley v{\\bf A}lue-based\n{\\bf PE}rceptual (SHAPE) scores that measure the marginal contribution of\nindividual modalities and the degree of cooperation across modalities. Using\nthese scores, we systematically evaluate different fusion methods on different\nmulti-modal datasets for different tasks. Our experiments suggest that for some\ntasks where different modalities are complementary, the multi-modal models\nstill tend to use the dominant modality alone and ignore the cooperation across\nmodalities. On the other hand, models learn to exploit cross-modal cooperation\nwhen different modalities are indispensable for the task. In this case, the\nscores indicate it is better to fuse different modalities at relatively early\nstages. We hope our scores can help improve the understanding of how the\npresent multi-modal models operate on different modalities and encourage more\nsophisticated methods of integrating multiple modalities.",

To obtain training images from images that already contain manually\ndesigned graphic layout data, previous work suggests masking design elements\n(e.g., texts and embellishments) as model inputs, which inevitably leaves hint\nof the ground truth. We study the misalignment between the training inputs\n(with hint masks) and test inputs (without masks), and design a novel domain\nalignment module (DAM) to narrow this gap. For training, we built a large-scale\nlayout dataset which consists of 60,548 advertising posters with annotated\nlayout information. To evaluate the generated layouts, we propose three novel\nmetrics according to aesthetic intuitions. Through both quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed model can synthesize\nhigh-quality graphic layouts according to image compositions.",

Therefore, the domain adaptation\ncan benefit from a subset of source data composed solely of helpful and\nrelevant samples. The proposed method effectively subsamples full source data\nto generate a small-scale meaningful subset. Therefore, training time is\nreduced, and performance is improved with our subsampled source data. To\nfurther verify the scalability of our method, we construct a new dataset called\nOcean Ship, which comprises 500 real and 200K synthetic sample images with\nground-truth labels. The SDSS achieved a state-of-the-art performance when\napplied on GTA5 to Cityscapes and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes public benchmark\ndatasets and a 9.13 mIoU improvement on our Ocean Ship dataset over a baseline\nmodel.",

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) learns from the temporal dynamics of user-item\ninteractions to predict the next ones. Fairness-aware recommendation mitigates\na variety of algorithmic biases in the learning of user preferences. This paper\naims at bringing a marriage between SR and algorithmic fairness. We propose a\nnovel fairness-aware sequential recommendation task, in which a new metric,\ninteraction fairness, is defined to estimate how recommended items are fairly\ninteracted by users with different protected attribute groups. We propose a\nmulti-task learning based deep end-to-end model, FairSR, which consists of two\nparts. One is to learn and distill personalized sequential features from the\ngiven user and her item sequence for SR. The other is fairness-aware preference\ngraph embedding (FPGE). The aim of FPGE is two-fold: incorporating the\nknowledge of users' and items' attributes and their correlation into entity\nrepresentations, and alleviating the unfair distributions of user attributes on\nitems. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets show FairSR can\noutperform state-of-the-art SR models in recommendation performance. In\naddition, the recommended items by FairSR also exhibit promising interaction\nfairness.",

    "abstract": "Rapid development of large-scale pre-training has resulted in foundation\nmodels that can act as effective feature extractors on a variety of downstream\ntasks and domains. Motivated by this, we study the efficacy of pre-trained\nvision models as a foundation for downstream continual learning (CL) scenarios.\nOur goal is twofold. First, we want to understand the compute-accuracy\ntrade-off between CL in the raw-data space and in the latent space of\npre-trained encoders. Second, we investigate how the characteristics of the\nencoder, the pre-training algorithm and data, as well as of the resulting\nlatent space affect CL performance. For this, we compare the efficacy of\nvarious pre-trained models in large-scale benchmarking scenarios with a vanilla\nreplay setting applied in the latent and in the raw-data space. Notably, this\nstudy shows how transfer, forgetting, task similarity and learning are\ndependent on the input data characteristics and not necessarily on the CL\nalgorithms. First, we show that under some circumstances reasonable CL\nperformance can readily be achieved with a non-parametric classifier at\nnegligible compute. We then show how models pre-trained on broader data result\nin better performance for various replay sizes. We explain this with\nrepresentational similarity and transfer properties of these representations.\nFinally, we show the effectiveness of self-supervised pre-training for\ndownstream domains that are out-of-distribution as compared to the pre-training\ndomain. We point out and validate several research directions that can further\nincrease the efficacy of latent CL including representation ensembling. The\ndiverse set of datasets used in this study can serve as a compute-efficient\nplayground for further CL research. The codebase is available under\nhttps://github.com/oleksost/latent_CL.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate multipoint evaluation is the problem of evaluating a\nmultivariate polynomial, given as a coefficient vector, simultaneously at\nmultiple evaluation points. In this work, we show that there exists a\ndeterministic algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation over any finite\nfield $\\mathbb{F}$ that outputs the evaluations of an $m$-variate polynomial of\ndegree less than $d$ in each variable at $N$ points in time \\[\n(d^m+N)^{1+o(1)}\\cdot\\poly(m,d,\\log|\\mathbb{F}|) \\] for all $m\\in\\N$ and all\nsufficiently large $d\\in\\mathbb{N}$.\nA previous work of Kedlaya and Umans (FOCS 2008, SICOMP 2011) achieved the\nsame time complexity when the number of variables $m$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$ and\nhad left the problem of removing this condition as an open problem. A recent\nwork of Bhargava, Ghosh, Kumar and Mohapatra (STOC 2022) answered this question\nwhen the underlying field is not \\emph{too} large and has characteristic less\nthan $d^{o(1)}$. In this work, we remove this constraint on the number of\nvariables over all finite fields, thereby answering the question of Kedlaya and\nUmans over all finite fields.\nOur algorithm relies on a non-trivial combination of ideas from three\nseemingly different previously known algorithms for multivariate multipoint\nevaluation, namely the algorithms of Kedlaya and Umans, that of Bj\\\"orklund,\nKaski and Williams (IPEC 2017, Algorithmica 2019), and that of Bhargava, Ghosh,\nKumar and Mohapatra, together with a result of Bombieri and Vinogradov from\nanalytic number theory about the distribution of primes in an arithmetic\nprogression.\nWe also present a second algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation\nthat is completely elementary and in particular, avoids the use of the\nBombieri--Vinogradov Theorem. However, it requires a mild assumption that the\nfield size is bounded by an exponential-tower in $d$ of bounded\n\\textit{height}.",

A\npractical model for this task needs to infer these priorities of the opponent\non the fly based on partial dialogues as input, without needing additional\nannotations for training. In this work, we propose a ranker for identifying\nthese priorities from negotiation dialogues. The model takes in a partial\ndialogue as input and predicts the priority order of the opponent.

Currently, this process is done manually by creating\naccurate masks of objects to be inserted and carefully blending them with the\ntarget scene or images, usually with the help of tools such as Photoshop or\nGIMP. While there have been several works on automatic selection of objects for\ncreating masks, the problem of object placement within an image with the\ncorrect position, scale, and harmony remains a difficult problem with limited\nexploration. Automatic object insertion in images or designs is a difficult\nproblem as it requires understanding of the scene geometry and the color\nharmony between objects.

    "abstract": "Spatial relations are fundamental to human cognition and are the most basic\nknowledge for us to understand and communicate about our physical surroundings.\nIn this paper, we ask the critical question: Are current vision-and-language\nmodels (VLMs) able to correctly understand spatial relations? To answer this\nquestion, we propose Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR), a novel benchmark task\nwith human labelled dataset for investigating VLMs' capabilities in recognising\n65 types of spatial relationships (e.g., under, in front of, facing etc.) in\nnatural text-image pairs. Specifically, given a caption and an image, the model\nneeds to perform binary classification and decide if the caption accurately\ndescribes the spatial relationships of two objects presented in the image.\nWhile being seemingly simple and straightforward, the task shows a large gap\nbetween human and model performance (human ceiling on the VSR task is above 95%\nand models only achieve around 70%). With fine-grained categorisation and\ncontrol on both concepts and relations, our VSR benchmark enables us to perform\ninteresting probing analysis to pinpoint VLMs' failure cases and the reasons\nbehind. We observe that VLMs' by-relation performances have little correlation\nwith the number of training examples and the tested models are in general\nincapable of recognising relations that concern orientations of objects. Also,\nVLMs have poor zero-shot generalisation toward unseen concepts. The dataset and\ncode are released at github.com/cambridgeltl/visual-spatial-reasoning.",

    "abstract": "A common requirement of plant breeding programs across the country is\ncompanion planting -- growing different species of plants in close proximity so\nthey can mutually benefit each other. However, the determination of companion\nplants requires meticulous monitoring of plant growth. The technique of ocular\nmonitoring is often laborious and error prone. The availability of image\nprocessing techniques can be used to address the challenge of plant growth\nmonitoring and provide robust solutions that assist plant scientists to\nidentify companion plants. This paper presents a new image processing algorithm\nto determine the amount of vegetation cover present in a given area, called\nfractional vegetation cover. The proposed technique draws inspiration from the\ntrusted Daubenmire method for vegetation cover estimation and expands upon it.\nBriefly, the idea is to estimate vegetation cover from images containing\nmultiple rows of plant species growing in close proximity separated by a\nmulti-segment PVC frame of known size. The proposed algorithm applies a Hough\nTransform and Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) to estimate the amount\nof vegetation cover within each segment of the PVC frame. The analysis when\nrepeated over images captured at regular intervals of time provides crucial\ninsights into plant growth. As a means of comparison, the proposed algorithm is\ncompared with SamplePoint and Canopeo, two trusted applications used for\nvegetation cover estimation. The comparison shows a 99% similarity with both\nSamplePoint and Canopeo demonstrating the accuracy and feasibility of the\nalgorithm for fractional vegetation cover estimation.",

To control the system, we combined fuzzy\nlogic with adaptive control theory. The system is extensively nonlinear and\nhighly sensitive to the controller's parameters, making it a real challenge to\nstudy these parameters' effect on the controller's performance. Using\nmetaheuristic algorithms for determining these parameters is a promising\nsolution. This paper proposes using a modified particle swarm optimization\n(MPSO) algorithm to optimize the controller. The algorithm shows a high ability\nto perform the global search and find a reasonable search space. The algorithm\nmodifies the search space of each particle based on its fitness function value\nand substitutes weak particles for new ones. These modifications have led to\nbetter accuracy and convergence rate. We prove the efficiency of the MPSO\nalgorithm by comparing it with the standard PSO and six other well-known\nmetaheuristic algorithms when optimizing the adaptive fuzzy logic controller of\nthe 3-DOF helicopter. The proposed method's effectiveness is shown through\ncomputer simulations while the system is subject to uncertainties and\ndisturbance.

    "abstract": "Detection of rare objects (e.g., traffic cones, traffic barrels and traffic\nwarning triangles) is an important perception task to improve the safety of\nautonomous driving. Training of such models typically requires a large number\nof annotated data which is expensive and time consuming to obtain. To address\nthe above problem, an emerging approach is to apply data augmentation to\nautomatically generate cost-free training samples. In this work, we propose a\nsystematic study on simple Copy-Paste data augmentation for rare object\ndetection in autonomous driving. Specifically, local adaptive instance-level\nimage transformation is introduced to generate realistic rare object masks from\nsource domain to the target domain. Moreover, traffic scene context is utilized\nto guide the placement of masks of rare objects. To this end, our data\naugmentation generates training data with high quality and realistic\ncharacteristics by leveraging both local and global consistency. In addition,\nwe build a new dataset named NM10k consisting 10k training images, 4k\nvalidation images and the corresponding labels with a diverse range of\nscenarios in autonomous driving. Experiments on NM10k show that our method\nachieves promising results on rare object detection.

    "abstract": "Micro-expression recognition (MER) is valuable because the involuntary nature\nof micro-expressions (MEs) can reveal genuine emotions. Most works recognize\nMEs by taking RGB videos or images as input. In fact, the activated facial\nregions in ME images are very small and the subtle motion can be easily\nsubmerged in the unrelated information. Facial landmarks are a low-dimensional\nand compact modality, which leads to much lower computational cost and can\npotentially concentrate more on ME-related features. However, the\ndiscriminability of landmarks for MER is not clear. Thus, this paper explores\nthe contribution of facial landmarks and constructs a new framework to\nefficiently recognize MEs with sole facial landmark information. Specially, we\ndesign a separate structure module to separately aggregate the spatial and\ntemporal information in the geometric movement graph based on facial landmarks,\nand a Geometric Two-Stream Graph Network is constructed to aggregate the\nlow-order geometric information and high-order semantic information of facial\nlandmarks. Furthermore, two core components are proposed to enhance features.\nSpecifically, a semantic adjacency matrix can automatically model the\nrelationship between nodes even long-distance nodes in a self-learning fashion;\nand an Adaptive Action Unit loss is introduced to guide the learning process\nsuch that the learned features are forced to have a synchronized pattern with\nfacial action units. Notably, this work tackles MER only utilizing geometric\nfeatures, processed based on a graph model, which provides a new idea with much\nhigher efficiency to promote MER. The experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method can achieve competitive or even superior performance with a\nsignificantly reduced computational cost, and facial landmarks can\nsignificantly contribute to MER and are worth further study for efficient ME\nanalysis.",

This paper presents a complete framework for extracting and\nprocessing crude oil-related events found in CrudeOilNews corpus, addressing\nthe issue of annotation scarcity and class imbalance by leveraging on the\neffectiveness of transfer learning.

The relationship between trust and uncertainty warrants approaches\ndesigned to maximize the former quality whilst minimizing the latter.\nUnfortunately, there is no consensus on an approach to ensure the\ntrustworthiness of IoT networks, in particular, addressing the uncertainty\nissues in a fine-grained way.

    "abstract": "The aim of reinforcement learning (RL) is to allow the agent to achieve the\nfinal goal. Most RL studies have focused on improving the efficiency of\nlearning to achieve the final goal faster. However, the RL model is very\ndifficult to modify an intermediate route in the process of reaching the final\ngoal. That is, the agent cannot be under control to achieve other sub-goals in\nthe existing studies. If the agent can go through the sub-goals on the way to\nthe destination, the RL can be applied and studied in various fields. In this\nstudy, I propose a methodology to achieve the user-defined sub-goals as well as\nthe final goal using memory editing. The memory editing is performed to\ngenerate various sub-goals and give an additional reward to the agent. In\naddition, the sub-goals are separately learned from the final goal. I set two\nsimple environments and various scenarios in the test environments. As a\nresult, the agent almost successfully passed the sub-goals as well as the final\ngoal under control. Moreover, the agent was able to be induced to visit the\nnovel state indirectly in the environments. I expect that this methodology can\nbe used in the fields that need to control the agent in a variety of scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WS-TAL), the methods\ncommonly follow the \"localization by classification\" procedure, which uses the\nsnippet predictions to form video class scores and then optimizes a video\nclassification loss. In this procedure, the snippet predictions (or snippet\nattention weights) are used to separate foreground and background. However, the\nsnippet predictions are usually inaccurate due to absence of frame-wise labels,\nand then the overall performance is hindered. In this paper, we propose a novel\nC$^3$BN to achieve robust snippet predictions. C$^3$BN includes two key designs\nby exploring the inherent characteristics of video data. First, because of the\nnatural continuity of adjacent snippets, we propose a micro data augmentation\nstrategy to increase the diversity of snippets with convex combination of\nadjacent snippets. Second, we propose a macro-micro consistency regularization\nstrategy to force the model to be invariant (or equivariant) to the\ntransformations of snippets with respect to video semantics, snippet\npredictions and snippet features. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed method on top of baselines for the WS-TAL tasks\nwith video-level and point-level supervision.",

    "title": "A Simple Approach to Improve Single-Model Deep Uncertainty via  Distance-Awareness",
    "abstract": "Accurate uncertainty quantification is a major challenge in deep learning, as\nneural networks can make overconfident errors and assign high confidence\npredictions to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. The most popular approaches to\nestimate predictive uncertainty in deep learning are methods that combine\npredictions from multiple neural networks, such as Bayesian neural networks\n(BNNs) and deep ensembles. However their practicality in real-time,\nindustrial-scale applications are limited due to the high memory and\ncomputational cost. Furthermore, ensembles and BNNs do not necessarily fix all\nthe issues with the underlying member networks. In this work, we study\nprincipled approaches to improve uncertainty property of a single network,\nbased on a single, deterministic representation. By formalizing the uncertainty\nquantification as a minimax learning problem, we first identify distance\nawareness, i.e., the model's ability to quantify the distance of a testing\nexample from the training data, as a necessary condition for a DNN to achieve\nhigh-quality (i.e., minimax optimal) uncertainty estimation. We then propose\nSpectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a simple method that\nimproves the distance-awareness ability of modern DNNs with two simple changes:\n(1) applying spectral normalization to hidden weights to enforce bi-Lipschitz\nsmoothness in representations and (2) replacing the last output layer with a\nGaussian process layer. On a suite of vision and language understanding\nbenchmarks, SNGP outperforms other single-model approaches in prediction,\ncalibration and out-of-domain detection. Furthermore, SNGP provides\ncomplementary benefits to popular techniques such as deep ensembles and data\naugmentation, making it a simple and scalable building block for probabilistic\ndeep learning.

Solid-state LiDAR (SSL),\na recently introduced LiDAR technique, can perceive high-resolution geometric\ninformation of the scenes, which can be potential utilised to receive accurate\ndepth information. Meanwhile, the fusion of the sensory information from LiDAR\nand camera can significantly enhance the sensing ability of the harvesting\nrobots. This work introduces a LiDAR-camera fusion-based visual sensing and\nperception strategy to perform accurate fruit localisation for a harvesting\nrobot in the apple orchards. Two SOTA extrinsic calibration methods,\ntarget-based and targetless-based, are applied and evaluated to obtain the\naccurate extrinsic matrix between the LiDAR and camera. With the extrinsic\ncalibration, the point clouds and color images are fused to perform fruit\nlocalisation using a one-stage instance segmentation network. Experimental\nshows that LiDAR-camera achieves better quality on visual sensing in the\nnatural environments. Meanwhile, introducing the LiDAR-camera fusion largely\nimproves the accuracy and robustness of the fruit localisation. Specifically,\nthe standard deviations of fruit localisation by using LiDAR-camera at 0.5 m,\n1.2 m, and 1.8 m are 0.245, 0.227, and 0.275 cm respectively.

    "abstract": "Grant-free protocols exploiting compressed sensing (CS) multi-user detection\n(MUD) are appealing for solving the random access problem in massive\nmachine-type communications (mMTC) with sporadic device activity. Such\nprotocols would greatly benefit from a prior deterministic knowledge of the\nsparsity level, i.e., instantaneous number of simultaneously active devices\n$K$. Aiming at this, herein we introduce a framework relying on coordinated\npilot transmissions (CPT) over a short phase at the beginning of the\ntransmission block for detecting $K$ in mMTC scenarios under Rayleigh fading.\nCPT can be implemented either as: i) U-CPT, which exploits only uplink\ntransmissions, or A-CPT, which includes also downlink transmissions for channel\nstate information (CSI) acquisition that resolve fading uncertainty. We discuss\ntwo specific implementations of A-CPT: ii) A-CPT-F, which implements CSI-based\nphase corrections while leveraging the same statistical inverse power control\nused by U-CPT, and iii) A-CPT-D, which implements a dynamic CSI-based inverse\npower control, although it requires some active devices to remain in silence if\ntheir corresponding channels are too faded. We derive a signal sparsity level\ndetector for each CPT mechanism by relaxing the original integer\ndetection/classification problem to an estimation problem in the continuous\nreal domain followed by a rounding operation. We show that the variance of the\nrelaxed estimator increases with $K^2$ and $K$ when operating with U-CPT and\nA-CPT mechanisms, respectively. The distribution of the estimators under U-CPT,\nA-CPT-F and A-CPT-D is found to follow an exponential, Gaussian, and Student's\n$t-$like distribution, respectively. Analyses evince the superiority of\nA-CPT-D, which is also corroborated via numerical results. We reveal several\ninteresting trade-offs and highlight potential research directions.",

    "abstract": "Frequency control plays a pivotal role in reliable power system operations.\nIt is conventionally performed in a hierarchical way that first rapidly\nstabilizes the frequency deviations and then slowly recovers the nominal\nfrequency. However, as the generation mix shifts from synchronous generators to\nrenewable resources, power systems experience larger and faster frequency\nfluctuations due to the loss of inertia, which adversely impacts the frequency\nstability. This has motivated active research in algorithms that jointly\naddress frequency degradation and economic efficiency in a fast timescale,\namong which the distributed averaging-based integral (DAI) control is a notable\none that sets controllable power injections directly proportional to the\nintegrals of frequency deviation and economic inefficiency signals.\nNevertheless, DAI do not typically consider the transient performance of the\nsystem following power disturbances and has been restricted to quadratic\noperational cost functions. This manuscript aims to leverage nonlinear optimal\ncontrollers to simultaneously achieve optimal transient frequency control and\nfind the most economic power dispatch for frequency restoration. To this end,\nwe integrate reinforcement learning (RL) to the classic DAI, which results in\nRL-DAI. Specifically, we use RL to learn a neural network-based control policy\nmapping from the integral variables of DAI to the controllable power injections\nwhich provides optimal transient frequency control, while DAI inherently\nensures the frequency restoration and optimal economic dispatch. Compared to\nexisting methods, we provide provable guarantees on the stability of the\nlearned controllers and extend allowable cost functions to a much larger class.\nSimulations on the 39-bus New England system illustrate our results.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, progress in NLU has been driven by benchmarks. These\nbenchmarks are typically collected by crowdsourcing, where annotators write\nexamples based on annotation instructions crafted by dataset creators. In this\nwork, we hypothesize that annotators pick up on patterns in the crowdsourcing\ninstructions, which bias them to write similar examples that are then\nover-represented in the collected data. We study this form of bias, termed\ninstruction bias, in 14 recent NLU benchmarks, showing that instruction\nexamples often exhibit concrete patterns, which are propagated by crowdworkers\nto the collected data. This extends previous work (Geva et al., 2019) and\nraises a new concern of whether we are modeling the dataset creator's\ninstructions, rather than the task. Through a series of experiments, we show\nthat, indeed, instruction bias can lead to overestimation of model performance,\nand that models struggle to generalize beyond biases originating in the\ncrowdsourcing instructions. We further analyze the influence of instruction\nbias in terms of pattern frequency and model size, and derive concrete\nrecommendations for creating future NLU benchmarks.",

Most of the existing studies\nfocus on the semantic learning of the code, whilst few studies are devoted to\ncross-language tasks. The main challenge of cross-language program\nclassification is how to extract semantic features of different programming\nlanguages. In order to cope with this difficulty, we propose a Unified Abstract\nSyntax Tree (namely UAST in this paper) neural network. In detail, the core\nidea of UAST consists of two unified mechanisms. First, UAST learns an AST\nrepresentation by unifying the AST traversal sequence and graph-like AST\nstructure for capturing semantic code features. Second, we construct a\nmechanism called unified vocabulary, which can reduce the feature gap between\ndifferent programming languages, so it can achieve the role of cross-language\nprogram classification. Besides, we collect a dataset containing 20,000 files\nof five programming languages, which can be used as a benchmark dataset for the\ncross-language program classification task. We have done experiments on two\ndatasets, and the results show that our proposed approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art baselines in terms of four evaluation metrics (Precision,\nRecall, F1-score, and Accuracy).",

    "abstract": "Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) technology aims to tackle the challenge of\nrestoring the degraded underwater images due to light absorption and\nscattering. To address problems, a novel U-Net based Reinforced Swin-Convs\nTransformer for the Underwater Image Enhancement method (URSCT-UIE) is\nproposed. Specifically, with the deficiency of U-Net based on pure\nconvolutions, we embedded the Swin Transformer into U-Net for improving the\nability to capture the global dependency. Then, given the inadequacy of the\nSwin Transformer capturing the local attention, the reintroduction of\nconvolutions may capture more local attention. Thus, we provide an ingenious\nmanner for the fusion of convolutions and the core attention mechanism to build\na Reinforced Swin-Convs Transformer Block (RSCTB) for capturing more local\nattention, which is reinforced in the channel and the spatial attention of the\nSwin Transformer. Finally, the experimental results on available datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed URSCT-UIE achieves state-of-the-art performance\ncompared with other methods in terms of both subjective and objective\nevaluations. The code will be released on GitHub after acceptance.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of forecasting multivariate aggregated\nhuman mobility while preserving the privacy of the individuals concerned.\nDifferential privacy, a state-of-the-art formal notion, has been used as the\nprivacy guarantee in two different and independent steps when training deep\nlearning models. On one hand, we considered \\textit{gradient perturbation},\nwhich uses the differentially private stochastic gradient descent algorithm to\nguarantee the privacy of each time series sample in the learning stage. On the\nother hand, we considered \\textit{input perturbation}, which adds differential\nprivacy guarantees in each sample of the series before applying any learning.\nWe compared four state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks: Long Short-Term\nMemory, Gated Recurrent Unit, and their Bidirectional architectures, i.e.,\nBidirectional-LSTM and Bidirectional-GRU. Extensive experiments were conducted\nwith a real-world multivariate mobility dataset, which we published openly\nalong with this paper. As shown in the results, differentially private deep\nlearning models trained under gradient or input perturbation achieve nearly the\nsame performance as non-private deep learning models, with loss in performance\nvarying between $0.57\\%$ to $2.8\\%$. The contribution of this paper is\nsignificant for those involved in urban planning and decision-making, providing\na solution to the human mobility multivariate forecast problem through\ndifferentially private deep learning models.",

    "abstract": "We revisit classic string problems considered in the area of parameterized\ncomplexity, and study them through the lens of dynamic data structures. That\nis, instead of asking for a static algorithm that solves the given instance\nefficiently, our goal is to design a data structure that efficiently maintains\na solution, or reports a lack thereof, upon updates in the instance.\nWe first consider the Closest String problem, for which we design randomized\ndynamic data structures with amortized update times $d^{\\mathcal{O}(d)}$ and\n$|\\Sigma|^{\\mathcal{O}(d)}$, respectively, where $\\Sigma$ is the alphabet and\n$d$ is the assumed bound on the maximum distance. These are obtained by\ncombining known static approaches to Closest String with color-coding.\nNext, we note that from a result of Frandsen et al.~[J. ACM'97] one can\neasily infer a meta-theorem that provides dynamic data structures for\nparameterized string problems with worst-case update time of the form\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log \\log n)$, where $k$ is the parameter in question and $n$ is\nthe length of the string. We showcase the utility of this meta-theorem by\ngiving such data structures for problems Disjoint Factors and Edit Distance. We\nalso give explicit data structures for these problems, with worst-case update\ntimes $\\mathcal{O}(k2^{k}\\log \\log n)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(k^2\\log \\log n)$,\nrespectively. Finally, we discuss how a lower bound methodology introduced by\nAmarilli et al.~[ICALP'21] can be used to show that obtaining update time\n$\\mathcal{O}(f(k))$ for Disjoint Factors and Edit Distance is unlikely already\nfor a constant value of the parameter $k$.",

    "title": "On Binary Networked Public Goods Game with Altruism",
    "abstract": "In the classical Binary Networked Public Goods (BNPG) game, a player can\neither invest in a public project or decide not to invest. Based on the\ndecisions of all the players, each player receives a reward as per his/her\nutility function. However, classical models of BNPG game do not consider\naltruism, which players often exhibit and can significantly affect equilibrium\nbehavior. Yu et al. [24] extended the classical BNPG game to capture the\naltruistic aspect of the players. We, in this paper, first study the problem of\ndeciding the existence of a Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium (PSNE) in a BNPG\ngame with altruism. This problem is already known to be NP-complete. We\ncomplement this hardness result by showing that the problem admits efficient\nalgorithms when the input network is either a tree or a complete graph. We\nfurther study the Altruistic Network Modification problem, where the task is to\ncompute if a target strategy profile can be made a PSNE by adding or deleting a\nfew edges. This problem is also known to be NP-complete. We strengthen this\nhardness result by exhibiting intractability results even for trees. A perhaps\nsurprising finding of our work is that the above problem remains NP-hard even\nfor bounded degree graphs when the altruism network is undirected, but becomes\npolynomial-time solvable when the altruism network is directed. We also show\nsome results on computing an MSNE and some parameterized complexity results. In\nsummary, our results show that it is much easier to predict how the players in\na BNPG game will behave compared to how the players in a BNPG game can be made\nto behave in a desirable way.",

    "abstract": "A logic has uniform interpolation if its formulas can be projected down to\ngiven subsignatures, preserving all logical consequences that do not mention\nthe removed symbols; the weaker property of (Craig) interpolation allows the\nprojected formula -- the interpolant -- to be different for each logical\nconsequence of the original formula. These properties are of importance, e.g.,\nin the modularization of logical theories. We study interpolation in the\ncontext of coalgebraic modal logics, i.e. modal logics axiomatized in rank 1,\nrestricting for clarity to the case with finitely many modalities. Examples of\nsuch logics include the modal logics K and KD, neighbourhood logic and its\nmonotone variant, finite-monoid-weighted logics, and coalition logic. We\nintroduce a notion of one-step (uniform) interpolation, which refers only to a\nrestricted logic without nesting of modalities, and show that a coalgebraic\nmodal logic has uniform interpolation if it has one-step interpolation.\nMoreover, we identify preservation of finite surjective weak pullbacks as a\nsufficient, and in the monotone case necessary, condition for one-step\ninterpolation. We thus prove or reprove uniform interpolation for most of the\nexamples listed above.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is a promising energy-efficient AI model when\nimplemented on neuromorphic hardware. However, it is a challenge to efficiently\ntrain SNNs due to their non-differentiability. Most existing methods either\nsuffer from high latency (i.e., long simulation time steps), or cannot achieve\nas high performance as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In this paper, we\npropose the Differentiation on Spike Representation (DSR) method, which could\nachieve high performance that is competitive to ANNs yet with low latency.\nFirst, we encode the spike trains into spike representation using (weighted)\nfiring rate coding. Based on the spike representation, we systematically derive\nthat the spiking dynamics with common neural models can be represented as some\nsub-differentiable mapping. With this viewpoint, our proposed DSR method trains\nSNNs through gradients of the mapping and avoids the common\nnon-differentiability problem in SNN training. Then we analyze the error when\nrepresenting the specific mapping with the forward computation of the SNN. To\nreduce such error, we propose to train the spike threshold in each layer, and\nto introduce a new hyperparameter for the neural models. With these components,\nthe DSR method can achieve state-of-the-art SNN performance with low latency on\nboth static and neuromorphic datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet,\nand DVS-CIFAR10.",

However, these methods rely on a critical assumption that\nthere is no treatment leakage: that is, the text only contains information\nabout the confounder and no information about treatment assignment. When this\nassumption does not hold, methods that control for text to adjust for\nconfounders face the problem of post-treatment (collider) bias. However, the\nassumption that there is no treatment leakage may be unrealistic in real-world\nsituations involving text, as human language is rich and flexible. Language\nappearing in a public policy document or health records may refer to the future\nand the past simultaneously, and thereby reveal information about the treatment\nassignment.\nIn this article, we define the treatment-leakage problem, and discuss the\nidentification as well as the estimation challenges it raises. Second, we\ndelineate the conditions under which leakage can be addressed by removing the\ntreatment-related signal from the text in a pre-processing step we define as\ntext distillation. Lastly, using simulation, we show how treatment leakage\nintroduces a bias in estimates of the average treatment effect (ATE) and how\ntext distillation can mitigate this bias.",

    "abstract": "Biological agents possess bodies that are mostly of soft tissues. Researchers\nhave resorted to soft bodies to investigate Artificial Life (ALife)-related\nquestions; similarly, a new era of soft-bodied robots has just begun.\nNevertheless, because of their infinite degrees of freedom, soft bodies pose\nunique challenges in terms of simulation, control, and optimization. Here we\npropose a novel soft-bodied agents formalism, namely Pressure-based Soft Agents\n(PSAs): they are bodies of gas enveloped by a chain of springs and masses, with\npressure pushing on the masses from inside the body. Pressure endows the agents\nwith structure, while springs and masses simulate softness and allow the agents\nto assume a large gamut of shapes. Actuation takes place by changing the length\nof springs or modulating global pressure. We optimize the controller of PSAs\nfor a locomotion task on hilly terrain and an escape task from a cage; the\nlatter is particularly suitable for soft-bodied agents, as it requires the\nagent to contort itself to squeeze through a small aperture. Our results\nsuggest that PSAs are indeed effective at those tasks and that controlling\npressure is fundamental for shape-changing. Looking forward, we envision PSAs\nto play a role in the modeling of soft-bodied agents, including soft robots and\nbiological cells.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has received high interest from researchers and\npractitioners to train machine learning (ML) models for healthcare. Ensuring\nthe trustworthiness of these models is essential. Especially bias, defined as a\ndisparity in the model's predictive performance across different subgroups, may\ncause unfairness against specific subgroups, which is an undesired phenomenon\nfor trustworthy ML models. In this research, we address the question to which\nextent bias occurs in medical FL and how to prevent excessive bias through\nreward systems. We first evaluate how to measure the contributions of\ninstitutions toward predictive performance and bias in cross-silo medical FL\nwith a Shapley value approximation method. In a second step, we design\ndifferent reward systems incentivizing contributions toward high predictive\nperformance or low bias. We then propose a combined reward system that\nincentivizes contributions toward both. We evaluate our work using multiple\nmedical chest X-ray datasets focusing on patient subgroups defined by patient\nsex and age. Our results show that we can successfully measure contributions\ntoward bias, and an integrated reward system successfully incentivizes\ncontributions toward a well-performing model with low bias. While the\npartitioning of scans only slightly influences the overall bias, institutions\nwith data predominantly from one subgroup introduce a favorable bias for this\nsubgroup. Our results indicate that reward systems, which focus on predictive\nperformance only, can transfer model bias against patients to an institutional\nlevel. Our work helps researchers and practitioners design reward systems for\nFL with well-aligned incentives for trustworthy ML.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized online learning (DOL) has been increasingly researched in the\nlast decade, mostly motivated by its wide applications in sensor networks,\ncommercial buildings, robotics (e.g., decentralized target tracking and\nformation control), smart grids, deep learning, and so forth. In this problem,\nthere are a network of agents who may be cooperative (i.e., decentralized\nonline optimization) or noncooperative (i.e., online game) through local\ninformation exchanges, and the local cost function of each agent is often\ntime-varying in dynamic and even adversarial environments. At each time, a\ndecision must be made by each agent based on historical information at hand\nwithout knowing future information on cost functions. Although this problem has\nbeen extensively studied in the last decade, a comprehensive survey is lacking.\nTherefore, this paper provides a thorough overview of DOL from the perspective\nof problem settings, communication, computation, and performances. In addition,\nsome potential future directions are also discussed in details.",

    "abstract": "We introduce two-crossing elections as a generalization of single-crossing\nelections, showing a number of new results. First, we show that two-crossing\nelections can be recognized in polynomial time, by reduction to the\nwell-studied consecutive ones problem. We also conjecture that recognizing\n$k$-crossing elections is NP-complete in general, providing evidence by\nrelating to a problem similar to consecutive ones proven to be hard in the\nliterature. Single-crossing elections exhibit a transitive majority relation,\nfrom which many important results follow. On the other hand, we show that the\nclassical Debord-McGarvey theorem can still be proven two-crossing, implying\nthat any weighted majority tournament is inducible by a two-crossing election.\nThis shows that many voting rules are NP-hard under two-crossing elections,\nincluding Kemeny and Slater. This is in contrast to the single-crossing case\nand outlines an important complexity boundary between single- and two-crossing.\nSubsequently, we show that for two-crossing elections the Young scores of all\ncandidates can be computed in polynomial time, by formulating a totally\nunimodular linear program. Finally, we consider the Chamberlin-Courant rule\nwith arbitrary disutilities and show that a winning committee can be computed\nin polynomial time, using an approach based on dynamic programming.",

    "abstract": "Document-level relation extraction (RE) aims at extracting relations among\nentities expressed across multiple sentences, which can be viewed as a\nmulti-label classification problem. In a typical document, most entity pairs do\nnot express any pre-defined relation and are labeled as \"none\" or \"no\nrelation\". For good document-level RE performance, it is crucial to distinguish\nsuch \\textit{none} class instances (entity pairs) from those of pre-defined\nclasses (relations). However, most existing methods only estimate the\nprobability of pre-defined relations independently without considering the\nprobability of \"no relation\". This ignores the context of entity pairs and the\nlabel correlations between the none class and pre-defined classes, leading to\nsub-optimal predictions. To address this problem, we propose a new multi-label\nloss that encourages large \\textit{margins} of label confidence scores between\neach pre-defined class and the none class, which enables captured label\ncorrelations and context-dependent thresholding for label prediction. To gain\nfurther robustness against positive-negative imbalance and mislabeled data that\ncould appear in real-world RE datasets, we propose a margin regularization and\na margin shifting technique. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly outperforms existing multi-label losses for document-level RE and\nworks well in other multi-label tasks such as emotion classification when none\nclass instances are available for training.",

    "abstract": "In real life, acoustic scenes and audio events are naturally correlated.\nHumans instinctively rely on fine-grained audio events as well as the overall\nsound characteristics to distinguish diverse acoustic scenes. Yet, most\nprevious approaches treat acoustic scene classification (ASC) and audio event\nclassification (AEC) as two independent tasks. A few studies on scene and event\njoint classification either use synthetic audio datasets that hardly match the\nreal world, or simply use the multi-task framework to perform two tasks at the\nsame time. Neither of these two ways makes full use of the implicit and\ninherent relation between fine-grained events and coarse-grained scenes. To\nthis end, this paper proposes a relation-guided ASC (RGASC) model to further\nexploit and coordinate the scene-event relation for the mutual benefit of scene\nand event recognition. The TUT Urban Acoustic Scenes 2018 dataset (TUT2018) is\nannotated with pseudo labels of events by a simple and efficient audio-related\npre-trained model PANN, which is one of the state-of-the-art AEC models. Then,\na prior scene-event relation matrix is defined as the average probability of\nthe presence of each event type in each scene class. Finally, the two-tower\nRGASC model is jointly trained on the real-life dataset TUT2018 for both scene\nand event classification. The following results are achieved. 1) RGASC\neffectively coordinates the true information of coarse-grained scenes and the\npseudo information of fine-grained events. 2) The event embeddings learned from\npseudo labels under the guidance of prior scene-event relations help reduce the\nconfusion between similar acoustic scenes. 3) Compared with other\n(non-ensemble) methods, RGASC improves the scene classification accuracy on the\nreal-life dataset.",

We formed three such rater pools for this study--specialized\nrater pools of raters from the U.S. who identify as African American, LGBTQ,\nand those who identify as neither.

We\nfound that rater identity is a statistically significant factor in how raters\nwill annotate toxicity for identity-related annotations. Using preliminary\ncontent analysis, we examined the comments with the most disagreement between\nrater pools and found nuanced differences in the toxicity annotations. Next, we\ntrained models on the annotations from each of the different rater pools, and\ncompared the scores of these models on comments from several test sets.\nFinally, we discuss how using raters that self-identify with the subjects of\ncomments can create more inclusive machine learning models, and provide more\nnuanced ratings than those by random raters.",

    "title": "An Early Fault Detection Method of Rotating Machines Based on Multiple  Feature Fusion with Stacking Architecture",
    "abstract": "Early fault detection (EFD) of rotating machines is important to decrease the\nmaintenance cost and improve the mechanical system stability. One of the key\npoints of EFD is developing a generic model to extract robust and\ndiscriminative features from different equipment for early fault detection.\nMost existing EFD methods focus on learning fault representation by one type of\nfeature. However, a combination of multiple features can capture a more\ncomprehensive representation of system state. In this paper, we propose an EFD\nmethod based on multiple feature fusion with stacking architecture (M2FSA). The\nproposed method can extract generic and discriminiative features to detect\nearly faults by combining time domain (TD), frequency domain (FD), and\ntime-frequency domain (TFD) features. In order to unify the dimensions of the\ndifferent domain features, Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) is utilized to\nlearn deep features in three domains. The architecture of the proposed M2FSA\nconsists of two layers. The first layer contains three base models, whose\ncorresponding inputs are different deep features. The outputs of the first\nlayer are concatenated to generate the input to the second layer, which\nconsists of a meta model. The proposed method is tested on three bearing\ndatasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is better than\nexisting methods both in sensibility and reliability.",

A successful controlled splitting\napproach should at least tackle the following two well-known and interrelated\nproblems: \"when to split?\" and \"where to split?\". Multiple previous\npublications consider these problems separately, and even those pursuing a\ncombined approach propose solutions with limited applicability.

Moreover, we are showing how our loss of\nsynchronism detection principle can be coupled with the known controlled\nsplitting techniques to form an integrated defense scheme against unintentional\nloss of synchronism.

    "abstract": "This work presents a probabilistic scheme for solving semilinear nonlocal\ndiffusion equations with volume constraints and integrable kernels. The\nnonlocal model of interest is defined by a time-dependent semilinear partial\nintegro-differential equation (PIDE), in which the integro-differential\noperator consists of both local convection-diffusion and nonlocal diffusion\noperators. Our numerical scheme is based on the direct approximation of the\nnonlinear Feynman-Kac formula that establishes a link between nonlinear PIDEs\nand stochastic differential equations. The exploitation of the Feynman-Kac\nrepresentation successfully avoids solving dense linear systems arising from\nnonlocality operators. Compared with existing stochastic approaches, our method\ncan achieve first-order convergence after balancing the temporal and spatial\ndiscretization errors, which is a significant improvement of existing\nprobabilistic/stochastic methods for nonlocal diffusion problems. Error\nanalysis of our numerical scheme is established. The effectiveness of our\napproach is shown in two numerical examples. The first example considers a\nthree-dimensional nonlocal diffusion equation to numerically verify the error\nanalysis results. The second example presents a physics problem motivated by\nthe study of heat transport in magnetically confined fusion plasmas.",

    "abstract": "Precise and timely traffic flow prediction plays a critical role in\ndeveloping intelligent transportation systems and has attracted considerable\nattention in recent decades. Despite the significant progress in this area\nbrought by deep learning, challenges remain. Traffic flows usually change\ndramatically in a short period, which prevents the current methods from\naccurately capturing the future trend and likely causes the over-fitting\nproblem, leading to unsatisfied accuracy. To this end, this paper proposes a\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based method that can forecast the short-term\ntraffic flow precisely and avoid local optimum problems during training.\nSpecifically, instead of using the non-stationary raw traffic data directly, we\nfirst decompose them into sub-components, where each one is less noisy than the\noriginal input. Afterward, Sample Entropy (SE) is employed to merge similar\ncomponents to reduce the computation cost. The merged features are fed into the\nLSTM, and we then introduce a spatiotemporal module to consider the neighboring\nrelationships in the recombined signals to avoid strong autocorrelation. During\ntraining, we utilize the Grey Wolf Algorithm (GWO) to optimize the parameters\nof LSTM, which overcome the overfitting issue. We conduct the experiments on a\nUK public highway traffic flow dataset, and the results show that the proposed\nmethod performs favorably against other state-of-the-art methods with better\nadaption performance on extreme outliers, delay effects, and trend-changing\nresponses.",

We present two\n$\\textit{adversarial planning}$ algorithms-one static and one adaptive-that\nperturb input planning instances to maximize cost (often substantially so). We\nevaluate the performance of the algorithms against two dominant planning\nalgorithms used in commercial applications (D* Lite and Fast Downward) and show\nboth are vulnerable to extremely limited adversarial action. Here, experiments\nshow that an adversary is able to increase plan costs in 66.9% of instances by\nonly removing a single action from the actions space (D* Lite) and render 70%\nof instances from an international planning competition unsolvable by removing\nonly three actions (Fast Forward). Finally, we show that finding an optimal\nperturbation in any search-based planning system is NP-hard.",

    "abstract": "Classification systems are often deployed in resource-constrained settings\nwhere labels must be assigned to inputs on a budget of time, memory, etc.\nBudgeted, sequential classifiers (BSCs) address these scenarios by processing\ninputs through a sequence of partial feature acquisition and evaluation steps\nwith early-exit options. This allows for an efficient evaluation of inputs that\nprevents unneeded feature acquisition. To approximate an intractable\ncombinatorial problem, current approaches to budgeted classification rely on\nwell-behaved loss functions that account for two primary objectives (processing\ncost and error). These approaches offer improved efficiency over traditional\nclassifiers but are limited by analytic constraints in formulation and do not\nmanage additional performance objectives. Notably, such methods do not\nexplicitly account for an important aspect of real-time detection systems --\nthe fraction of \"accepted\" predictions satisfying a confidence criterion\nimposed by a risk-averse monitor.\nWe propose a problem-specific genetic algorithm to build budgeted, sequential\nclassifiers with confidence-based reject options. Three objectives -- accuracy,\nprocessing time/cost, and coverage -- are considered. The algorithm emphasizes\nPareto efficiency while accounting for a notion of aggregate performance via a\nunique scalarization. Experiments show our method can quickly find globally\nPareto optimal solutions in very large search spaces and is competitive with\nexisting approaches while offering advantages for selective, budgeted\ndeployment scenarios.",

Data-driven machine learning models, such\nas deep neural networks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have become\nviable alternatives. However, pure black-box data-driven models mapping inputs\nto outputs without considering the underlying physics suffer from unstable and\ninaccurate generalization performance. This study proposes a machine-learned\nphysics-informed data-driven constitutive modeling approach for path-dependent\nmaterials based on the measurable material states. The proposed data-driven\nconstitutive model is designed with the consideration of universal\nthermodynamics principles, where the ISVs essential to the material\npath-dependency are inferred automatically from the hidden state of RNNs. The\nRNN describing the evolution of the data-driven machine-learned ISVs follows\nthe thermodynamics second law. To enhance the robustness and accuracy of RNN\nmodels, stochasticity is introduced to model training. The effects of the\nnumber of RNN history steps, the internal state dimension, the model\ncomplexity, and the strain increment on model performances have been\ninvestigated.

In particular, the present work is\nmotivated by the goal of reducing energy dissipation in turbulent flows, and\nthe example considered is the spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics of the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE). A major challenge associated with RL is\nthat substantial training data must be generated by repeatedly interacting with\nthe target system, making it costly when the system is computationally or\nexperimentally expensive. We mitigate this challenge in a data-driven manner by\ncombining dimensionality reduction via an autoencoder with a neural ODE\nframework to obtain a low-dimensional dynamical model from just a limited data\nset. We substitute this data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) in place of the\ntrue system during RL training to efficiently estimate the optimal policy,\nwhich can then be deployed on the true system. For the KSE actuated with\nlocalized forcing (\"jets\") at four locations, we demonstrate that we are able\nto learn a ROM that accurately captures the actuated dynamics as well as the\nunderlying natural dynamics just from snapshots of the KSE experiencing random\nactuations. Using this ROM and a control objective of minimizing dissipation\nand power cost, we extract a control policy from it using deep RL. We show that\nthe ROM-based control strategy translates well to the true KSE and highlight\nthat the RL agent discovers and stabilizes an underlying forced equilibrium\nsolution of the KSE system.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a high-order deferred correction algorithm combined with\npenalty iteration for solving free and moving boundary problems, using a\nfourth-order finite difference method. Typically, when free boundary problems\nare solved on a fixed computational grid, the order of the solution is low due\nto the discontinuity in the solution at the free boundary, even if a high order\nmethod is used. Using a detailed error analysis, we observe that the order of\nconvergence of the solution can be increased to fifth-order by solving\nsuccessively corrected finite difference systems, where the corrections are\nderived from the previously computed lower order solutions. Since our method\napplies corrections to the right-hand side of the system and does not destroy\nthe monotone property of the discretization matrix, penalty iterations converge\nquickly in only a few iterations given a good initial guess. We demonstrate the\nefficiency of our algorithm using several examples. Numerical results show that\nour algorithm gives exactly fifth-order convergence for both the solution and\nthe free boundary location in the ideal case. We also test our algorithm on\nchallenging American put option pricing problems. Our algorithm gives expected\nhigh-order convergence and compares favorably with existing methods that aim\nfor high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In modern interactive speech-based systems, speech is consumed and\ntranscribed incrementally prior to having disfluencies removed. This\npost-processing step is crucial for producing clean transcripts and high\nperformance on downstream tasks (e.g. machine translation). However, most\ncurrent state-of-the-art NLP models such as the Transformer operate\nnon-incrementally, potentially causing unacceptable delays. We propose a\nstreaming BERT-based sequence tagging model that, combined with a novel\ntraining objective, is capable of detecting disfluencies in real-time while\nbalancing accuracy and latency. This is accomplished by training the model to\ndecide whether to immediately output a prediction for the current input or to\nwait for further context. Essentially, the model learns to dynamically size its\nlookahead window. Our results demonstrate that our model produces comparably\naccurate predictions and does so sooner than our baselines, with lower flicker.\nFurthermore, the model attains state-of-the-art latency and stability scores\nwhen compared with recent work on incremental disfluency detection.",

On top of the well-established existing TC layer, we\nintroduce a SC layer that utilizes knowledge bases of communicating parties for\nthe exchange of semantic information.

To make these SC and TC\nlayers interact, we propose various measures based on the entropy of a clause\nin a knowledge base. These measures allow us to delineate various technical\nissues on SC such as a message selection problem for improving the knowledge\nbase at a receiver. Extending this, we showcase selected examples in which SC\nand TC layers interact with each other while taking into account constraints on\nphysical channels and efficiently utilizing channel resources.",

While widely used WMFC\napproaches have shown good performance using classical machine learning\ntechniques, recent advances in deep learning reveal a promising direction\ntowards fast and effective WMFC. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning\nframework for WMFC, Deep Fiber Clustering (DFC), which solves the unsupervised\nclustering problem as a self-supervised learning task with a domain-specific\npretext task to predict pairwise fiber distances. This accelerates the fiber\nrepresentation learning to handle a known challenge in WMFC, i.e., the\nsensitivity of clustering results to the point ordering along fibers. We design\na novel network architecture that represents input fibers as point clouds and\nallows the incorporation of additional sources of input information from gray\nmatter parcellation. Thus DFC makes use of the combined white matter fiber\ngeometry and gray matter anatomical parcellation to improve anatomical\ncoherence of fiber clusters. In addition, DFC conducts outlier removal in a\nnatural way by rejecting fibers with low cluster assignment probabilities. We\nevaluate DFC on three independently acquired cohorts (including data from 220\nsubjects) and compare it to several state-of-the-art WMFC algorithms.\nExperimental results demonstrate superior performance of DFC in terms of\ncluster compactness, generalization ability, anatomical coherence, and\ncomputational efficiency.

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need for streamlining radiology Quality Assurance (QA)\nprograms to make them better and faster. Here, we present a novel approach,\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)-Based QUality Assurance by Restricted\nInvestigation of Unequal Scores (AQUARIUS), for re-defining radiology QA, which\nreduces human effort by up to several orders of magnitude over existing\napproaches. AQUARIUS typically includes automatic comparison of AI-based image\nanalysis with natural language processing (NLP) on radiology reports. Only the\nusually small subset of cases with discordant reads is subsequently reviewed by\nhuman experts. To demonstrate the clinical applicability of AQUARIUS, we\nperformed a clinical QA study on Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection in\n1936 head CT scans from a large academic hospital. Immediately following image\nacquisition, scans were automatically analyzed for ICH using a commercially\navailable software (Aidoc, Tel Aviv, Israel). Cases rated positive for ICH by\nAI (ICH-AI+) were automatically flagged in radiologists' reading worklists,\nwhere flagging was randomly switched off with probability 50\\%. Using AQUARIUS\nwith NLP on final radiology reports and targeted expert neuroradiology review\nof only 29 discordantly classified cases reduced the human QA effort by 98.5\\%,\nwhere we found a total of six non-reported true ICH+ cases, with radiologists'\nmissed ICH detection rates of 0.52\\% and 2.5\\% for flagged and non-flagged\ncases, respectively. We conclude that AQUARIUS, by combining AI-based image\nanalysis with NLP-based pre-selection of cases for targeted human expert\nreview, can efficiently identify missed findings in radiology studies and\nsignificantly expedite radiology QA programs in a hybrid human-machine\ninteroperability approach.",

The main challenge when designing equivariant\nmodels for point clouds is how to trade-off the performance of the model and\nthe complexity. Existing equivariant models are either too complicate to\nimplement or very high complexity. The main aim of this study is to build a\ngeneral procedure to introduce group equivariant property to SOTA models for 3D\npoint clouds. The group equivariant models built form our procedure are simple\nto implement, less complexity in comparison with the existing ones, and they\npreserve the strengths of the original SOTA backbone. From the results of the\nexperiments on object classification, it is shown that our methods are superior\nto other group equivariant models in performance and complexity. Moreover, our\nmethod also helps to improve the mIoU of semantic segmentation models. Overall,\nby using a combination of only-finite-rotation equivariance and augmentation,\nour models can outperform existing full $SO(3)$-equivariance models with much\ncheaper complexity and GPU memory.

This\nrectification method led to consistent quality improvements on WMT\nEnglish-German, English-French, English-Czech and English-Chinese tasks, up to\n+0.3 BLEU at beam size 4 and +2.8 BLEU at beam size 200.",

Giallar requires no manual specifications, invariants, or\nproofs, and can automatically verify that a compiler pass preserves the\nsemantics of quantum circuits. To deal with unbounded loops in quantum\ncompilers, Giallar abstracts three loop templates, whose loop invariants can be\nautomatically inferred. To efficiently check the equivalence of arbitrary input\nand output circuits that have complicated matrix semantics representation,\nGiallar introduces a symbolic representation for quantum circuits and a set of\nrewrite rules for showing the equivalence of symbolic quantum circuits. With\nGiallar, we implemented and verified 44 (out of 56) compiler passes in 13\nversions of the Qiskit compiler, the open-source quantum compiler standard,\nduring which three bugs were detected in and confirmed by Qiskit. Our\nevaluation shows that most of Qiskit compiler passes can be automatically\nverified in seconds and verification imposes only a modest overhead to\ncompilation performance.",

    "abstract": "Background: Most of the existing machine learning models for security tasks,\nsuch as spam detection, malware detection, or network intrusion detection, are\nbuilt on supervised machine learning algorithms. In such a paradigm, models\nneed a large amount of labeled data to learn the useful relationships between\nselected features and the target class. However, such labeled data can be\nscarce and expensive to acquire. Goal: To help security practitioners train\nuseful security classification models when few labeled training data and many\nunlabeled training data are available. Method: We propose an adaptive framework\ncalled Dapper, which optimizes 1) semi-supervised learning algorithms to assign\npseudo-labels to unlabeled data in a propagation paradigm and 2) the machine\nlearning classifier (i.e., random forest). When the dataset class is highly\nimbalanced, Dapper then adaptively integrates and optimizes a data oversampling\nmethod called SMOTE. We use the novel Bayesian Optimization to search a large\nhyperparameter space of these tuning targets. Result: We evaluate Dapper with\nthree security datasets, i.e., the Twitter spam dataset, the malware URLs\ndataset, and the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset. Experimental results indicate that we\ncan use as low as 10% of original labeled data but achieve close or even better\nclassification performance than using 100% labeled data in a supervised way.\nConclusion: Based on those results, we would recommend using hyperparameter\noptimization with semi-supervised learning when dealing with shortages of\nlabeled security data.",

    "abstract": "Classical and contemporary distributed consensus protocols, may they be for\nbinary agreement, state machine replication, or blockchain consensus, require\nall protocol participants in a peer-to-peer system to agree on exactly the same\ninformation as part of the consensus payload. Although this model of consensus\nis extensively studied, and is useful for most consensus based decentralized\napplications, it falls short of defining correct distributed systems which\nmandate participant credential based privileged visibility into the consensus\npayload, through the consensus protocol itself. We introduce a new paradigm for\ndistributed consensus, called functional blockchain consensus. Functional\nblockchain consensus allows each blockchain protocol participant to agree on\nsome distinct sub-information of the list of transactions, as a function of the\ncredentials of the participant in the blockchain system, instead of agreeing on\nthe entire list of transactions. We motivate two adversary models, one with a\nstandard crash-fault adversary and another with a novel rational-fault\nadversary, to compromise functional blockchain consensus. We then present two\nversions of a blockchain protocol called SightSteeple, that achieves functional\nblockchain consensus in the said fault models. SightSteeple relies on a novel\ncombination of standard blockchain consensus and functional encryption, among\nother primitives, to achieve its goals of correctness.

Existing methods on noisy label have\nfocused on modifying classifier training procedure. It results in two possible\nproblems. First, these methods are not applicable to a pre-trained classifier\nwithout further access into training. Second, it is not easy to train a\nclassifier and remove all of negative effects from noisy labels simultaneously.\nFrom these problems, we suggests a new branch of approach, Noisy Prediction\nCalibration (NPC) in learning with noisy labels. Through the introduction and\nestimation of a new type of transition matrix via generative model, NPC\ncorrects the noisy prediction from the pre-trained classifier to the true label\nas a post-processing scheme. We prove that NPC theoretically aligns with the\ntransition matrix based methods. Yet, NPC provides more accurate pathway to\nestimate true label, even without involvement in classifier learning.

    "abstract": "The softmax layer in neural machine translation is designed to model the\ndistribution over mutually exclusive tokens. Machine translation, however, is\nintrinsically uncertain: the same source sentence can have multiple\nsemantically equivalent translations. Therefore, we propose to replace the\nsoftmax activation with a multi-label classification layer that can model\nambiguity more effectively. We call our loss function Single-label Contrastive\nObjective for Non-Exclusive Sequences (SCONES). We show that the multi-label\noutput layer can still be trained on single reference training data using the\nSCONES loss function. SCONES yields consistent BLEU score gains across six\ntranslation directions, particularly for medium-resource language pairs and\nsmall beam sizes. By using smaller beam sizes we can speed up inference by a\nfactor of 3.9x and still match or improve the BLEU score obtained using\nsoftmax. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SCONES can be used to train NMT\nmodels that assign the highest probability to adequate translations, thus\nmitigating the \"beam search curse\". Additional experiments on synthetic\nlanguage pairs with varying levels of uncertainty suggest that the improvements\nfrom SCONES can be attributed to better handling of ambiguity.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art 3D detection methods rely on supervised learning and large\nlabelled datasets. However, annotating lidar data is resource-consuming, and\ndepending only on supervised learning limits the applicability of trained\nmodels. Against this backdrop, here we propose using a self-supervised training\nstrategy to learn a general point cloud backbone model for downstream 3D vision\ntasks. 3D scene flow can be estimated with self-supervised learning using cycle\nconsistency, which removes labelled data requirements. Moreover, the perception\nof objects in the traffic scenarios heavily relies on making sense of the\nsparse data in the spatio-temporal context. Our main contribution leverages\nlearned flow and motion representations and combines a self-supervised backbone\nwith a 3D detection head focusing mainly on the relation between the scene flow\nand detection tasks. In this way, self-supervised scene flow training\nconstructs point motion features in the backbone, which help distinguish\nobjects based on their different motion patterns used with a 3D detection head.\nExperiments on KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks show that the proposed\nself-supervised pre-training increases 3D detection performance significantly.",

    "abstract": "Machine reading comprehension has aroused wide concerns, since it explores\nthe potential of model for text understanding. To further equip the machine\nwith the reasoning capability, the challenging task of logical reasoning is\nproposed. Previous works on logical reasoning have proposed some strategies to\nextract the logical units from different aspects. However, there still remains\na challenge to model the long distance dependency among the logical units.\nAlso, it is demanding to uncover the logical structures of the text and further\nfuse the discrete logic to the continuous text embedding. To tackle the above\nissues, we propose an end-to-end model Logiformer which utilizes a two-branch\ngraph transformer network for logical reasoning of text. Firstly, we introduce\ndifferent extraction strategies to split the text into two sets of logical\nunits, and construct the logical graph and the syntax graph respectively. The\nlogical graph models the causal relations for the logical branch while the\nsyntax graph captures the co-occurrence relations for the syntax branch.\nSecondly, to model the long distance dependency, the node sequence from each\ngraph is fed into the fully connected graph transformer structures. The two\nadjacent matrices are viewed as the attention biases for the graph transformer\nlayers, which map the discrete logical structures to the continuous text\nembedding space. Thirdly, a dynamic gate mechanism and a question-aware\nself-attention module are introduced before the answer prediction to update the\nfeatures. The reasoning process provides the interpretability by employing the\nlogical units, which are consistent with human cognition. The experimental\nresults show the superiority of our model, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art single model on two logical reasoning benchmarks.",

Community search\nallows for personalized community discovery and has a wide range of\napplications in large real-world networks. While community search has been\nwidely explored for single-layer graphs, the problem for multilayer graphs has\njust recently attracted attention. Existing community models in multilayer\ngraphs have several limitations, including disconnectivity, free-rider effect,\nresolution limits, and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we study the\nproblem of community search over large multilayer graphs.

Although the original standard defined the usage of DNS over UDP\n(DoUDP) as well as DNS over TCP (DoTCP), UDP has become the predominant\nprotocol used in the DNS. With the introduction of new Resource Records (RRs),\nthe sizes of DNS responses have increased considerably. Since this can lead to\ntruncation or IP fragmentation, the fallback to DoTCP as required by the\nstandard ensures successful DNS responses by overcoming the size limitations of\nDoUDP. However, the effects of the usage of DoTCP by stub resolvers are not\nextensively studied to this date. We close this gap by presenting a view at\nDoTCP from the Edge, issuing 12.1M DNS requests from 2,500 probes toward Public\nas well as Probe DNS recursive resolvers. In our measurement study, we observe\nthat DoTCP is generally slower than DoUDP, where the relative increase in\nResponse Time is less than 37% for most resolvers. While optimizations to DoTCP\ncan be leveraged to further reduce the response times, we show that support on\nPublic resolvers is still missing, hence leaving room for optimizations in the\nfuture. Moreover, we also find that Public resolvers generally have comparable\nreliability for DoTCP and DoUDP. However, Probe resolvers show a significantly\ndifferent behavior: DoTCP queries targeting Probe resolvers fail in 3 out of 4\ncases, and, therefore, do not comply with the standard.

Most existing works exploit either\nspatial-domain features or residual-domain features, while neglecting that two\ntypes of features are mutually correlated. In this paper, we propose a guided\nresiduals network, namely GRnet, which fuses spatial-domain and residual-domain\nfeatures in a mutually reinforcing way, to expose face images generated by\nDeepfake. Different from existing prediction based residual extraction methods,\nwe propose a manipulation trace extractor (MTE) to directly remove the content\nfeatures and preserve manipulation traces.

We conducted a large-scale\nconversation experiment with a conversational agent whose utterances were\nsynthesized with the model trained either with spontaneous speech or read\nspeech. The result showed that the subjects who interacted with the agent whose\nutterances were synthesized from spontaneous speech tended to show shorter\nresponse time and a larger number of backchannels. The result of a\nquestionnaire showed that subjects who interacted with the agent whose\nutterances were synthesized from spontaneous speech tended to rate their\nconversation with the agent as closer to a human conversation. These results\nsuggest that speech synthesis built on spontaneous speech is essential to\nrealize a conversational agent as a social actor.",

    "abstract": "Conversational Causal Emotion Entailment aims to detect causal utterances for\na non-neutral targeted utterance from a conversation. In this work, we build\nconversations as graphs to overcome implicit contextual modelling of the\noriginal entailment style. Following the previous work, we further introduce\nthe emotion information into graphs. Emotion information can markedly promote\nthe detection of causal utterances whose emotion is the same as the targeted\nutterance. However, it is still hard to detect causal utterances with different\nemotions, especially neutral ones. The reason is that models are limited in\nreasoning causal clues and passing them between utterances. To alleviate this\nproblem, we introduce social commonsense knowledge (CSK) and propose a\nKnowledge Enhanced Conversation graph (KEC). KEC propagates the CSK between two\nutterances. As not all CSK is emotionally suitable for utterances, we therefore\npropose a sentiment-realized knowledge selecting strategy to filter CSK. To\nprocess KEC, we further construct the Knowledge Enhanced Directed Acyclic Graph\nnetworks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms baselines and\ninfers more causes with different emotions from the targeted utterance.",

However, due to the complicated learning mechanism, these methods may\nbring some unnecessary performance losses. In this work, we rethink the\nadvantages of gradient operator in exposing face forgery, and design two\nplug-and-play modules by combining gradient operator with CNNs, namely tensor\npre-processing (TP) and manipulation trace attention (MTA) module.\nSpecifically, TP module refines the feature tensor of each channel in the\nnetwork by gradient operator to highlight the manipulation traces and improve\nthe feature representation. Moreover, MTA module considers two dimensions,\nnamely channel and manipulation traces, to force the network to learn the\ndistribution of manipulation traces. These two modules can be seamlessly\nintegrated into CNNs for end-to-end training. Experiments show that the\nproposed network achieves better results than prior works on five public\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "Ultra-reliability and low-latency are pivotal requirements of the new\ngeneration of communication networks. Over the past years, to increase\nthroughput, adaptive active antennas were introduced in advanced wireless\ncommunications, specifically in the domain of millimeter-wave (mmWave).\nConsequently, new lower-layer techniques were proposed to cope with the higher\ndimensional and electronic steerable beams. The transition from\nomni-directional to highly directional antennas presents a new type of wireless\nsystems that deliver high bandwidth, but that are susceptible to high losses\nand high latency variation. Classical approaches cannot close the rising gap\nbetween high throughput and low delay in those advanced systems. In this work,\nwe incorporate effective sliding window network coding solutions in mmWave\ncommunications. While legacy systems such as rateless codes improve delay, our\nresults show that they do not provide low latency communications (LLC - below\n10 ms), but fixed sliding window random linear network coding (RLNC), does.\nMoreover, adaptive sliding window RLNC obtains ultra-reliable LLC (URLLC - LLC\nwith maximum delay below 10 ms with more than 99% probability).",

    "abstract": "This paper argues that generative art driven by conformance to a visual\nand/or semantic corpus lacks the necessary criteria to be considered creative.\nAmong several issues identified in the literature, we focus on the fact that\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) that create a single image, in a vacuum,\nlack a concept of novelty regarding how their product differs from previously\ncreated ones. We envision that an algorithm that combines the novelty\npreservation mechanisms in evolutionary algorithms with the power of GANs can\ndeliberately guide its creative process towards output that is both good and\nnovel. In this paper, we use recent advances in image generation based on\nsemantic prompts using OpenAI's CLIP model, interrupting the GAN's iterative\nprocess with short cycles of evolutionary divergent search. The results of\nevolution are then used to continue the GAN's iterative process; we hypothesise\nthat this intervention will lead to more novel outputs. Testing our hypothesis\nusing novelty search with local competition, a quality-diversity evolutionary\nalgorithm that can increase visual diversity while maintaining quality in the\nform of adherence to the semantic prompt, we explore how different notions of\nvisual diversity can affect both the process and the product of the algorithm.\nResults show that even a simplistic measure of visual diversity can help\ncounter a drift towards similar images caused by the GAN. This first experiment\nopens a new direction for introducing higher intentionality and a more nuanced\ndrive for GANs.",

This is a\npopular topic due to the recent advances of inertial dynamics with damping in\nconvex optimization. Mathematically, the ground state of a rotating\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can be modelled as a minimizer of the\nGross-Pitaevskii energy functional with angular momentum rotational term under\nthe normalization constraint. We introduce two types of second-order flows as\nenergy minimization strategies for this constrained non-convex optimization\nproblem, in order to approach the ground state. The proposed artificial\ndynamics are novel second-order nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential\nequations with dissipation. Several numerical discretization schemes are\ndiscussed, including explicit and semi-implicit methods for temporal\ndiscretization, combined with a Fourier pseudospectral method for spatial\ndiscretization. These provide us a series of efficient and robust algorithms\nfor computing the ground states of rotating BECs. Particularly, the newly\ndeveloped algorithms turn out to be superior to the state-of-the-art numerical\nmethods based on the gradient flow. This is judged by the fact that larger size\nof time steps can be applied in explicit methods, and much smaller number of\ntime steps are needed in both explicit and semi-implicit discretizations, while\nevery time step encounters almost the same computational complexity in\ncomparison with the respective gradient flow type approaches.

RE is usually framed as a supervised machine\nlearning (ML) problem, where ML models are trained on annotated datasets.\nHowever, there are few annotated datasets for RE since the annotation process\ncan be costly and time-consuming. To address this, we developed Biographical,\nthe first semi-supervised dataset for RE. The dataset, which is aimed towards\ndigital humanities (DH) and historical research, is automatically compiled by\naligning sentences from Wikipedia articles with matching structured data from\nsources including Pantheon and Wikidata. By exploiting the structure of\nWikipedia articles and robust named entity recognition (NER), we match\ninformation with relatively high precision in order to compile annotated\nrelation pairs for ten different relations that are important in the DH domain.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset by training a\nstate-of-the-art neural model to classify relation pairs, and evaluate it on a\nmanually annotated gold standard set.

Here we propose a method\nfor measuring the affective, socially biased, component, thus enabling its\nremoval. That is, given a decision-making process, these affective measurements\nremove the affective bias in the decision, rendering it fair across a set of\ncategories defined by the method itself. We thus propose that this may solve\nthree key problems in intersectional fairness: (1) the definition of categories\nover which fairness is a consideration; (2) an infinite regress into smaller\nand smaller groups; and (3) ensuring a fair distribution based on basic human\nrights or other prior information. The primary idea in this paper is that\nfairness biases can be measured using affective coherence, and that this can be\nused to normalize outcome mappings. We aim for this conceptual work to expose a\nnovel method for handling fairness problems that uses emotional coherence as an\nindependent measure of bias that goes beyond statistical parity.",

    "abstract": "Recently, large-scale pre-training methods like CLIP have made great progress\nin multi-modal research such as text-video retrieval. In CLIP, transformers are\nvital for modeling complex multi-modal relations. However, in the vision\ntransformer of CLIP, the essential visual tokenization process, which produces\ndiscrete visual token sequences, generates many homogeneous tokens due to the\nredundancy nature of consecutive and similar frames in videos. This\nsignificantly increases computation costs and hinders the deployment of video\nretrieval models in web applications. In this paper, to reduce the number of\nredundant video tokens, we design a multi-segment token clustering algorithm to\nfind the most representative tokens and drop the non-essential ones. As the\nframe redundancy occurs mostly in consecutive frames, we divide videos into\nmultiple segments and conduct segment-level clustering. Center tokens from each\nsegment are later concatenated into a new sequence, while their original\nspatial-temporal relations are well maintained. We instantiate two clustering\nalgorithms to efficiently find deterministic medoids and iteratively partition\ngroups in high dimensional space. Through this token clustering and center\nselection procedure, we successfully reduce computation costs by removing\nredundant visual tokens. This method further enhances segment-level semantic\nalignment between video and text representations, enforcing the spatio-temporal\ninteractions of tokens from within-segment frames. Our method, coined as\nCenterCLIP, surpasses existing state-of-the-art by a large margin on typical\ntext-video benchmarks, while reducing the training memory cost by 35\\% and\naccelerating the inference speed by 14\\% at the best case.

    "abstract": "In a Fisher market, agents (users) spend a budget of (artificial) currency to\nbuy goods that maximize their utilities, and producers set prices on\ncapacity-constrained goods such that the market clears. The equilibrium prices\nin such a market are typically computed through the solution of a convex\nprogram, e.g., the Eisenberg-Gale program, that aggregates users' preferences\ninto a centralized social welfare objective. However, the computation of\nequilibrium prices using convex programs assumes that all transactions happen\nin a static market wherein all users are present simultaneously and relies on\ncomplete information on each user's budget and utility function.\nSince, in practice, information on users' utilities and budgets is unknown\nand users tend to arrive over time in the market, we study an online variant of\nFisher markets, wherein users enter the market sequentially. We focus on the\nsetting where users have linear utilities with privately known utility and\nbudget parameters drawn i.i.d. from a distribution $\\mathcal{D}$. In this\nsetting, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm to set prices that\npreserves user privacy while achieving a regret and capacity violation of\n$O(\\sqrt{n})$, where $n$ is the number of arriving users and the capacities of\nthe goods scale as $O(n)$. Here, our regret measure represents the optimality\ngap in the objective of the Eisenberg-Gale program between the online\nallocation policy and that of an offline oracle with complete information on\nusers' budgets and utilities. To establish the efficacy of our approach, we\nshow that even an algorithm that sets expected equilibrium prices with perfect\ninformation on the distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ cannot achieve both a regret and\nconstraint violation of better than $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we present\nnumerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of our approach relative\nto several benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Robotized warehouses are deployed to automatically distribute millions of\nitems brought by the massive logistic orders from e-commerce. A key to\nautomated item distribution is to plan paths for robots, also known as task\nplanning, where each task is to deliver racks with items to pickers for\nprocessing and then return the rack back. Prior solutions are unfit for\nlarge-scale robotized warehouses due to the inflexibility to time-varying item\narrivals and the low efficiency for high throughput. In this paper, we propose\na new task planning problem called TPRW, which aims to minimize the end-to-end\nmakespan that incorporates the entire item distribution pipeline, known as a\nfulfilment cycle. Direct extensions from state-of-the-art path finding methods\nare ineffective to solve the TPRW problem because they fail to adapt to the\nbottleneck variations of fulfillment cycles. In response, we propose Efficient\nAdaptive Task Planning, a framework for large-scale robotized warehouses with\ntime-varying item arrivals. It adaptively selects racks to fulfill at each\ntimestamp via reinforcement learning, accounting for the time-varying\nbottleneck of the fulfillment cycles. Then it finds paths for robots to\ntransport the selected racks. The framework adopts a series of efficient\noptimizations on both time and memory to handle large-scale item throughput.\nEvaluations on both synthesized and real data show an improvement of $37.1\\%$\nin effectiveness and $75.5\\%$ in efficiency over the state-of-the-arts.",

In deep neural networks,\nthe gradient followed by a single sample or a batch of samples is employed to\nsave computational resources and escape from saddle points.

The system promises high tractive performance in low\ngravity environments where tires have little traction for lack of weight. At\nEarth and Space 2021 we reported the performance of such spikes on a silty clay\nloam, a cohesive soil. We found that in such soil, traction below a critical\ndepth is provided by a zone of lateral soil failure. We also found that the\narticulation translates a horizontal draft force into a vertical penetration\nforce strong enough to penetrate a narrow spike to a depth where the soil can\nsustain the draft force, in a self-regulating way. It is conceivable that a\ngranular material like regolith or sand with little to no cohesive strength\nprovides less vertical penetration resistance and less resistance to a\nhorizontal draft force than a cohesive soil, which leads to the question of\nwhether and how much tractive force an interlocking spike can generate on a\ngranular material. Here we report on field trials that study different spike\ndesigns in dry and unsaturated moist sand. The results demonstrate that a loose\ngranular material requires larger spikes than a cohesive soil, that these\nlarger spikes penetrate dry and moist sand reliably, and that they promise good\ntractive efficiency.

The input consists of a graph $G\\in \\mathcal{G}$ and of rational\nprobabilities of existence on every edge of $G$, assuming independence. The\noutput is the probability of obtaining a matching of $G$ in the resulting\ndistribution, i.e., a set of edges that are pairwise disjoint. It is known\nthat, if $\\mathcal{G}$ has bounded treewidth, then\n$\\textrm{PrMatching}(\\mathcal{G})$ can be solved in polynomial time. In this\npaper we show that, under some assumptions, bounded treewidth in fact\ncharacterizes the tractable graph families for this problem. More precisely, we\nshow intractability for all graph families $\\mathcal{G}$ satisfying the\nfollowing treewidth-constructibility requirement: given an integer $k$ in\nunary, we can construct in polynomial time a graph $G \\in \\mathcal{G}$ with\ntreewidth at least $k$. Our hardness result is then the following: for any\ntreewidth-constructible graph family $\\mathcal{G}$, the problem\n$\\textrm{PrMatching}(\\mathcal{G})$ is intractable. This generalizes known\nhardness results for weighted matching counting under some restrictions that do\nnot bound treewidth, e.g., being planar, 3-regular, or bipartite; it also\nanswers a question left open in Amarilli, Bourhis and Senellart (PODS'16).

Faced with these two types\nof domain shifts, i.e., the illumination and the inherent difference of the\ndatasets, we propose a novel domain adaptation framework via cross-domain\ncorrelation distillation, called CCDistill.

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is one of the most effective models in\ngraph embedding. It extracts shallow features and neighborhood information by\naggregating neighbor information to learn the embedding representation of\ndifferent nodes. However, the local topology information of many nodes in the\nnetwork is similar, the network obtained by shallow embedding represents the\nnetwork that is susceptible to structural noise, and the low-order embedding\ncannot capture the high-order network structure; on the other hand, the deep\nembedding undergoes multi-layer convolution. After the filters are stacked, the\nembedded distribution is destroyed, and graph smoothing occurs. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a new framework that leverages network motifs to\nlearn deep features of the network from low-level embeddings under the\nassumption of network homogeneity and transitivity, and then combines local\nneighborhood information with deeper Global information fusion results in\naccurate representation of nodes. On real datasets, our model achieves\nsignificant performance improvement in link prediction and node classification.",

In\nthis work, we propose COSPLAY(COncept Set guided PersonaLized dialogue\ngeneration Across both partY personas) that considers both parties as a \"team\":\nexpressing self-persona while keeping curiosity toward the partner, leading\nresponses around mutual personas, and finding the common ground. Specifically,\nwe first represent self-persona, partner persona and mutual dialogue all in the\nconcept sets. Then, we propose the Concept Set framework with a suite of\nknowledge-enhanced operations to process them such as set algebras, set\nexpansion, and set distance. Based on these operations as medium, we train the\nmodel by utilizing 1) concepts of both party personas, 2) concept relationship\nbetween them, and 3) their relationship to the future dialogue.

In this paper,\nwe present a combined deep neural network of one-dimensional convolutions and\nLSTM to generate vertex displacement of a 3D template face model from\nvariable-length speech input. The motion of the lower part of the face, which\nis represented by the vertex movement of 3D lip shapes, is consistent with the\ninput speech. In order to enhance the robustness of the network to different\nsound signals, we adapt a trained speech recognition model to extract speech\nfeature, and a velocity loss term is adopted to reduce the jitter of generated\nfacial animation. We recorded a series of videos of a Chinese adult speaking\nMandarin and created a new speech-animation dataset to compensate the lack of\nsuch public data.

    "abstract": "Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is one of the most promising post-quantum\ncryptographic schemes which enable privacy-preserving computation on servers.\nHowever, noise accumulates as we perform operations on HE-encrypted data,\nrestricting the number of possible operations. Fully HE (FHE) removes this\nrestriction by introducing the bootstrapping operation, which refreshes the\ndata; however, FHE schemes are highly memory-bound. Bootstrapping, in\nparticular, requires loading GBs of evaluation keys and plaintexts from\noff-chip memory, which makes FHE acceleration fundamentally bottlenecked by the\noff-chip memory bandwidth.\nWe propose ARK, an Accelerator for FHE with Runtime data generation and\ninter-operation Key reuse. ARK enables practical FHE workloads with a novel\nalgorithm-hardware codesign to accelerate bootstrapping. We first eliminate the\noff-chip memory bandwidth bottleneck through runtime data generation and\ninter-operation key reuse. This approach enables ARK to fully exploit on-chip\nmemory by a substantial reduction in the working set size. On top of such\nalgorithmic innovations, we build ARK microarchitecture that minimizes on-chip\ndata movement through an efficient, alternating data distribution policy based\non the data access patterns and a streamlined dataflow organization of the\ntailored functional units - including base conversion, number-theoretic\ntransform, and automorphism units. Overall, our co-design effectively handles\nthe heavy computation and data movement overheads of FHE, drastically reducing\nthe cost of HE operations including bootstrapping.",

    "abstract": "User intent classification is an important task in information retrieval. In\nthis work, we introduce a revised taxonomy of user intent. We take the widely\nused differentiation between navigational, transactional and informational\nqueries as a starting point, and identify three different sub-classes for the\ninformational queries: instrumental, factual and abstain. The resulting\nclassification of user queries is more fine-grained, reaches a high level of\nconsistency between annotators, and can serve as the basis for an effective\nautomatic classification process. The newly introduced categories help\ndistinguish between types of queries that a retrieval system could act upon,\nfor example by prioritizing different types of results in the ranking.We have\nused a weak supervision approach based on Snorkel to annotate the ORCAS dataset\naccording to our new user intent taxonomy, utilising established heuristics and\nkeywords to construct rules for the prediction of the intent category. We then\npresent a series of experiments with a variety of machine learning models,\nusing the labels from the weak supervision stage as training data, but find\nthat the results produced by Snorkel are not outperformed by these competing\napproaches and can be considered state-of-the-art. The advantage of a\nrule-based approach like Snorkel's is its efficient deployment in an actual\nsystem, where intent classification would be executed for every query issued.\nThe resource released with this paper is the ORCAS-I dataset: a labelled\nversion of the ORCAS click-based dataset of Web queries, which provides 18\nmillion connections to 10 million distinct queries.",

    "abstract": "In reinforcement learning (RL), it is challenging to learn directly from\nhigh-dimensional observations, where data augmentation has recently been shown\nto remedy this via encoding invariances from raw pixels. Nevertheless, we\nempirically find that not all samples are equally important and hence simply\ninjecting more augmented inputs may instead cause instability in Q-learning. In\nthis paper, we approach this problem systematically by developing a\nmodel-agnostic Contrastive-Curiosity-Driven Learning Framework (CCLF), which\ncan fully exploit sample importance and improve learning efficiency in a\nself-supervised manner. Facilitated by the proposed contrastive curiosity, CCLF\nis capable of prioritizing the experience replay, selecting the most\ninformative augmented inputs, and more importantly regularizing the Q-function\nas well as the encoder to concentrate more on under-learned data. Moreover, it\nencourages the agent to explore with a curiosity-based reward. As a result, the\nagent can focus on more informative samples and learn representation\ninvariances more efficiently, with significantly reduced augmented inputs. We\napply CCLF to several base RL algorithms and evaluate on the DeepMind Control\nSuite, Atari, and MiniGrid benchmarks, where our approach demonstrates superior\nsample efficiency and learning performances compared with other\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

The diversity and usual\nstealthiness of APT turns them into a central problem of contemporary practical\nsystem security, since information on attacks, the current system status or the\nattacker's incentives is often vague, uncertain and in many cases even\nunavailable. Game theory is a natural approach to model the conflict between\nthe attacker and the defender, and this work investigates a generalized class\nof matrix games as a risk mitigation tool for an APT defense. Unlike standard\ngame and decision theory, our model is tailored to capture and handle the full\nuncertainty that is immanent to APT, such as disagreement among qualitative\nexpert risk assessments, unknown adversarial incentives and uncertainty about\nthe current system state (in terms of how deeply the attacker may have\npenetrated into the system's protective shells already). Practically,\ngame-theoretic APT models can be derived straightforwardly from topological\nvulnerability analysis, together with risk assessments as they are done in\ncommon risk management standards like the ISO 31000 family.

Open-domain\nconversational AI are known to have several challenges, including bland\nresponses and performance degradation when prompted with figurative language,\namong others. First, we provide some background by discussing some topics of\ninterest in conversational AI. We then discuss the method applied to the two\ninvestigations carried out that make up this study. The first investigation\ninvolves a search for recent SoTA open-domain conversational AI models while\nthe second involves the search for 100 conversational AI to assess their\ngender. Results of the survey show that progress has been made with recent SoTA\nconversational AI, but there are still persistent challenges that need to be\nsolved, and the female gender is more common than the male for conversational\nAI. One main take-away is that hybrid models of conversational AI offer more\nadvantages than any single architecture. The key contributions of this survey\nare 1) the identification of prevailing challenges in SoTA open-domain\nconversational AI, 2) the unusual discussion about open-domain conversational\nAI for low-resource languages, and 3) the discussion about the ethics\nsurrounding the gender of conversational AI.",

    "abstract": "Joint object detection and online multi-object tracking (JDT) methods have\nbeen proposed recently to achieve one-shot tracking. Yet, existing works\noverlook the importance of detection itself and often result in missed\ndetections when confronted by occlusions or motion blurs. The missed detections\naffect not only detection performance but also tracking performance due to\ninconsistent tracklets. Hence, we propose a new JDT model that recovers the\nmissed detections while associating the detection candidates of consecutive\nframes by learning object-level spatio-temporal consistency through edge\nfeatures in a Graph Neural Network (GNN). Our proposed model Sparse Graph\nTracker (SGT) converts video data into a graph, where the nodes are top-$K$\nscored detection candidates, and the edges are relations between the nodes at\ndifferent times, such as position difference and visual similarity. Two nodes\nare connected if they are close in either a Euclidean or feature space,\ngenerating a sparsely connected graph. Without motion prediction or\nRe-Identification (ReID), the association is performed by predicting an edge\nscore representing the probability that two connected nodes refer to the same\nobject. Under the online setting, our SGT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on\nthe MOT17/20 Detection and MOT16/20 benchmarks in terms of AP and MOTA,\nrespectively. Especially, SGT surpasses the previous SOTA on the crowded\ndataset MOT20 where partial occlusion cases are dominant, showing the\neffectiveness of detection recovery against partial occlusion.

    "abstract": "Text retrieval using dense embeddings generated from deep neural models is\ncalled \"dense passage retrieval\". Dense passage retrieval systems normally\ndeploy a deep neural model followed by an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN)\nsearch module. The model generates text embeddings, which are then indexed by\nthe ANN module. With the increasing data scale, the ANN module unavoidably\nbecomes the bottleneck on efficiency, because of its linear or sublinear time\ncomplexity with data scale. An alternative is the learned index which has a\ntheoretically constant time complexity. But most of the existing learned\nindexes are designed for low dimensional data. Thus they are not suitable for\ndense passage retrieval tasks with high-dimensional dense embeddings. We\npropose LIDER, an efficient high-dimensional Learned Index for large-scale\nDEnse passage Retrieval. LIDER has a clustering-based hierarchical architecture\nformed by two layers of core models. As the basic unit of LIDER to index and\nsearch data, each core model includes an adapted recursive model index (RMI)\nand a dimension reduction component which consists of an extended\nSortingKeys-LSH (SK-LSH) and a key re-scaling module. The dimension reduction\ncomponent reduces the high-dimensional dense embeddings into one-dimensional\nkeys and sorts them in a specific order, which are then used by the RMI. And\nthe RMI consists of multiple simple linear regression models that make fast\nprediction in only O(1) time. We successfully optimize and combine SK-LSH and\nRMI together into the core model, and organize multiple core models into a\ntwo-layer structure based on a clustering-based partitioning of the whole data\nspace. Experiments show that LIDER has a higher search speed with high\nretrieval quality comparing to the state-of-the-art ANN indexes commonly used\nin dense passage retrieval. Furthermore, LIDER has a better capability of\nspeed-quality trade-off.",

Recently, based on a \"solve-then-discretize\" paradigm, an operator\nanalogue of the FEAST method has been proposed for DEPs without discretization\nof the coefficient operators. Compared to conventional \"discretize-then-solve\"\napproaches that discretize the operators and solve the resulting matrix\nproblem, the operator analogue of FEAST exhibits much higher accuracy; however,\nit involves solving a large number of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).\nIn this paper, to reduce the computational costs, we propose operation\nanalogues of Sakurai-Sugiura-type complex moment-based eigensolvers for DEPs\nusing higher-order complex moments and analyze the error bound of the proposed\nmethods. We show that the number of ODEs to be solved can be reduced by a\nfactor of the degree of complex moments without degrading accuracy, which is\nverified by numerical results. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethods are over five times faster compared with the operator analogue of FEAST\nfor several DEPs while maintaining almost the same high accuracy.

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been utilized as useful side information to\nimprove recommendation quality. In those recommender systems, knowledge graph\ninformation often contains fruitful facts and inherent semantic relatedness\namong items. However, the success of such methods relies on the high quality\nknowledge graphs, and may not learn quality representations with two\nchallenges: i) The long-tail distribution of entities results in sparse\nsupervision signals for KG-enhanced item representation; ii) Real-world\nknowledge graphs are often noisy and contain topic-irrelevant connections\nbetween items and entities. Such KG sparsity and noise make the item-entity\ndependent relations deviate from reflecting their true characteristics, which\nsignificantly amplifies the noise effect and hinders the accurate\nrepresentation of user's preference.\nTo fill this research gap, we design a general Knowledge Graph Contrastive\nLearning framework (KGCL) that alleviates the information noise for knowledge\ngraph-enhanced recommender systems. Specifically, we propose a knowledge graph\naugmentation schema to suppress KG noise in information aggregation, and derive\nmore robust knowledge-aware representations for items. In addition, we exploit\nadditional supervision signals from the KG augmentation process to guide a\ncross-view contrastive learning paradigm, giving a greater role to unbiased\nuser-item interactions in gradient descent and further suppressing the noise.\nExtensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the consistent\nsuperiority of our KGCL over state-of-the-art techniques. KGCL also achieves\nstrong performance in recommendation scenarios with sparse user-item\ninteractions, long-tail and noisy KG entities.

    "abstract": "Numerical simulations are commonly used to understand the parameter\ndependence of given spatio-temporal phenomena. Sampling a multi-dimensional\nparameter space and running the respective simulations leads to an ensemble of\na large number of spatio-temporal simulation runs. A main objective for\nanalyzing the ensemble is to partition (or segment) the multi-dimensional\nparameter space into connected regions of simulation runs with similar\nbehavior. To facilitate such an analysis, we propose a novel visualization\nmethod for multi-dimensional parameter-space partitions. Our visualization is\nbased on the concept of a hyper-slicer, which allows for undistorted views of\nthe parameter-space segments' extent and transitions. For navigation within the\nparameter space, interactions with a 2D embedding of the parameter-space\nsamples, including their segment memberships, are supported. Parameter-space\npartitions are generated in a semi-automatic fashion by analyzing the\nsimilarity space of the ensemble's simulation runs. Clusters of similar\nsimulation runs induce the segments of the parameter-space partition. We link\nthe parameter-space partitioning visualizations to similarity-space\nvisualizations of the ensemble's simulation runs and embed them into an\ninteractive visual analysis tool that supports the analysis of all facets of\nthe spatio-temporal simulation ensemble targeted at the overarching goal of\nanalyzing the parameter-space partitioning.

    "abstract": "The stochastic $K$-armed bandit problem has been studied extensively due to\nits applications in various domains ranging from online advertising to clinical\ntrials. In practice however, the number of arms can be very large resulting in\nlarge memory requirements for simultaneously processing them. In this paper we\nconsider a streaming setting where the arms are presented in a stream and the\nalgorithm uses limited memory to process these arms. Here, the goal is not only\nto minimize regret, but also to do so in minimal memory. Previous algorithms\nfor this problem operate in one of the two settings: they either use\n$\\Omega(\\log \\log T)$ passes over the stream (Rathod, 2021; Chaudhuri and\nKalyanakrishnan, 2020; Liau et al., 2018), or just a single pass (Maiti et al.,\n2021).\nIn this paper we study the trade-off between memory and regret when $B$\npasses over the stream are allowed, for any $B \\geq 1$, and establish tight\nregret upper and lower bounds for any $B$-pass algorithm. Our results uncover a\nsurprising *sharp transition phenomenon*: $O(1)$ memory is sufficient to\nachieve $\\widetilde\\Theta\\Big(T^{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2^{B+2}-2}}\\Big)$\nregret in $B$ passes, and increasing the memory to any quantity that is $o(K)$\nhas almost no impact on further reducing this regret, unless we use $\\Omega(K)$\nmemory. Our main technical contribution is our lower bound which requires the\nuse of information-theoretic techniques as well as ideas from round elimination\nto show that the *residual problem* remains challenging over subsequent passes.",

This has led to an emerging research interest in semi-supervised\nlearning (SSL) for 3D point cloud. It is commonly assumed in SSL that the\nunlabeled data are drawn from the same distribution as that of the labeled\nones; This assumption, however, rarely holds true in realistic environments.\nBlindly using out-of-distribution (OOD) unlabeled data could harm SSL\nperformance. In this work, we propose to selectively utilize unlabeled data\nthrough sample weighting, so that only conducive unlabeled data would be\nprioritized. To estimate the weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization\nframework which iteratively optimizes a metaobjective on a held-out validation\nset and a task-objective on a training set. Faced with the instability of\nefficient bi-level optimizers, we further propose three regularization\ntechniques to enhance the training stability.

The model is\ntested under different types of reservoir control strategies based on real-time\nmeasurements (reactive control), and based on predictions of the future\nbehavior of the system (predictive control) using rainfall forecastings. We\napply the modeling approach in a system composed by a single watershed,\nreservoir, and a channel connected in series, respectively, for the San Antonio\nobserved rainfall data. Results indicate that for flood mitigation, the\npredictive control strategy outperforms the reactive controls not only when\napplied for synthetic design storm events, but also for a continuous\nsimulation. Moreover, the predictive control strategy requires smaller valve\noperations, while still guaranteeing efficient hydrological performance. From\nthe results, we recommend the use of the model predictive control strategy to\ncontrol stormwater systems due to the ability to handle different objective\nfunctions, which can be altered according to rainfall forecasting and shift the\nreservoir operation from flood-based control to strategies focused on\nincreasing detention times, depending on the forecasting.",

When multiagent systems are\nconsidered, these problems have natural analogues of existence (nonemptiness)\nof pure-strategy Nash equilibria and verification of pure-strategy Nash\nequilibria. Recently, this body of work has begun to include finite-horizon\ntemporal goals. With finite-horizon temporal goals, there is a natural\nhierarchy of goal representation, ranging from deterministic finite automata\n(DFA), to nondeterministic finite automata (NFA), and to alternating finite\nautomata (AFA), with a worst-case exponential gap between each successive\nrepresentation. Previous works showed that the realizability problem with DFA\ngoals was PSPACE-complete, while the realizability problem with temporal logic\ngoals is in 2EXPTIME. In this work, we study both the realizability and the\nverification problems with respect to various goal representations. We first\nshow that the realizability problem with NFA goals is EXPTIME-complete and with\nAFA goals is 2EXPTIME-complete, thus establishing strict complexity gaps\nbetween realizability with respect to DFA, NFA, and AFA goals. We then contrast\nthese complexity gaps with the complexity of the verification problem, where we\nshow that verification with respect to DFAs, NFA, and AFA goals is\nPSPACE-complete.",

Through this paper, we\nconsider calls to collect more data on demographics to enable algorithmic\nfairness and challenge the notion that discrimination can be overcome with\nsmart enough technical methods and sufficient data alone. We show how these\ntechniques largely ignore broader questions of data governance and systemic\noppression when categorizing individuals for the purpose of fairer algorithmic\nprocessing. In this work, we explore under what conditions demographic data\nshould be collected and used to enable algorithmic fairness methods by\ncharacterizing a range of social risks to individuals and communities. For the\nrisks to individuals we consider the unique privacy risks associated with the\nsharing of sensitive attributes likely to be the target of fairness analysis,\nthe possible harms stemming from miscategorizing and misrepresenting\nindividuals in the data collection process, and the use of sensitive data\nbeyond data subjects' expectations. Looking more broadly, the risks to entire\ngroups and communities include the expansion of surveillance infrastructure in\nthe name of fairness, misrepresenting and mischaracterizing what it means to be\npart of a demographic group or to hold a certain identity, and ceding the\nability to define for themselves what constitutes biased or unfair treatment.\nWe argue that, by confronting these questions before and during the collection\nof demographic data, algorithmic fairness methods are more likely to actually\nmitigate harmful treatment disparities without reinforcing systems of\noppression.",

To\nexplore safety outcomes associated with APD, we aim to build a causal model for\ndelirium in the ICU using large observational data sets connecting various\ncovariates correlated with delirium.

Our null hypothesis is: there is no significant difference in\noutcomes for delirium patients under different drug-group in the ICU. Through\nour exploratory, machine learning based and causal analysis, we had findings\nsuch as: mean length-of-stay and max length-of-stay is higher for patients in\nHaloperidol drug group, and haloperidol group has a higher rate of death in a\nyear compared to other two-groups. Our generated causal model explicitly shows\nthe functional relationships between different covariates. For future work, we\nplan to do time-varying analysis on the dataset.",

    "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) has become a prominent application\nof deep learning in scientific computation, as it is a powerful approximator of\nsolutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). There have been\nnumerous attempts to facilitate the training process of PINNs by adjusting the\nweight of each component of the loss function, called adaptive loss balancing\nalgorithms. In this paper, we propose an Augmented Lagrangian relaxation method\nfor PINNs (AL-PINNs). We treat the initial and boundary conditions as\nconstraints for the optimization problem of the PDE residual. By employing\nAugmented Lagrangian relaxation, the constrained optimization problem becomes a\nsequential max-min problem so that the learnable parameters $\\lambda$'s\nadaptively balance each loss component. Our theoretical analysis reveals that\nthe sequence of minimizers of the proposed loss functions converges to an\nactual solution for the Helmholtz, viscous Burgers, and Klein--Gordon\nequations. We demonstrate through various numerical experiments that AL-PINNs\nyields a much smaller relative error compared with that of state-of-the-art\nadaptive loss balancing algorithms.",

This has resulted in both educators and students spending more\ntime on the internet than ever before, which may be broadly summarized as both\nthese groups investigating, learning, and familiarizing themselves with\ninformation, tools, applications, and frameworks to adapt to online learning.\nThis paper takes an explorative approach to further investigate and analyze the\nimpact of COVID-19 on such web behavior data related to online learning to\ninterpret the associated interests, challenges, and needs. The study\nspecifically focused on investigating Google Search-based web behavior data as\nGoogle is the most popular search engine globally.

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing popularity of massive open online courses (MOOCs),\nmany suffer from high dropout and low success rates. Early prediction of\nstudent success for targeted intervention is therefore essential to ensure no\nstudent is left behind in a course. There exists a large body of research in\nsuccess prediction for MOOCs, focusing mainly on training models from scratch\nfor individual courses. This setting is impractical in early success prediction\nas the performance of a student is only known at the end of the course. In this\npaper, we aim to create early success prediction models that can be transferred\nbetween MOOCs from different domains and topics. To do so, we present three\nnovel strategies for transfer: 1) pre-training a model on a large set of\ndiverse courses, 2) leveraging the pre-trained model by including meta\ninformation about courses, and 3) fine-tuning the model on previous course\niterations. Our experiments on 26 MOOCs with over 145,000 combined enrollments\nand millions of interactions show that models combining interaction data and\ncourse information have comparable or better performance than models which have\naccess to previous iterations of the course. With these models, we aim to\neffectively enable educators to warm-start their predictions for new and\nongoing courses.",

Without an effective way to detect and\nmitigate AI induced inequalities, AI might do more harm than good, potentially\nleading to the widening of underlying inequalities. This paper proposes a\ngeneric allocation-deterioration framework for detecting and quantifying AI\ninduced inequality. Specifically, AI induced inequalities are quantified as the\narea between two allocation-deterioration curves. To assess the framework's\nperformance, experiments were conducted on ten synthetic datasets (N>33,000)\ngenerated from HiRID - a real-world Intensive Care Unit (ICU) dataset, showing\nits ability to accurately detect and quantify inequality proportionally to\ncontrolled inequalities. Extensive analyses were carried out to quantify health\ninequalities (a) embedded in two real-world ICU datasets; (b) induced by AI\nmodels trained for two resource allocation scenarios. Results showed that\ncompared to men, women had up to 33% poorer deterioration in markers of\nprognosis when admitted to HiRID ICUs. All four AI models assessed were shown\nto induce significant inequalities (2.45% to 43.2%) for non-White compared to\nWhite patients.

Their wide usage and consequential effects on individuals led the ML\ncommunity to question and raise concerns on how the algorithms differently\naffect different people and communities. In this paper, we study fairness\nissues that arise when decision-makers use models (proxy models) that deviate\nfrom the models that depict the physical and social environment in which the\ndecisions are situated (intended models). We also highlight the effect of\nobstacles on individual access and utilization of the models. To this end, we\nformulate an Equity Framework that considers equal access to the model, equal\noutcomes from the model, and equal utilization of the model, and\nconsequentially achieves equity and higher social welfare than current fairness\nnotions that aim for equality. We show how the three main aspects of the\nframework are connected and provide an equity scoring algorithm and questions\nto guide decision-makers towards equitable decision-making. We show how failure\nto consider access, outcome, and utilization would exacerbate proxy gaps\nleading to an infinite inequity loop that reinforces structural inequities\nthrough inaccurate and incomplete ground truth curation. We, therefore,\nrecommend a more critical look at the model design and its effect on equity and\na shift towards equity achieving predictive decision-making models.",

While data\nanalytics used to be mainly performed on cloud infrastructures, the rapid\ndevelopment of IoT infrastructures and the requirements for low-latency, secure\nprocessing has motivated the development of edge analytics. Today, to balance\nvarious trade-offs, ML-based analytics tends to increasingly leverage an\ninterconnected ecosystem that allows complex applications to be executed on\nhybrid infrastructures where IoT Edge devices are interconnected to Cloud/HPC\nsystems in what is called the Computing Continuum, the Digital Continuum, or\nthe Transcontinuum.Enabling learning-based analytics on such complex\ninfrastructures is challenging. The large scale and optimized deployment of\nlearning-based workflows across the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum requires extensive\nand reproducible experimental analysis of the application execution on\nrepresentative testbeds. This is necessary to help understand the performance\ntrade-offs that result from combining a variety of learning paradigms and\nsupportive frameworks. A thorough experimental analysis requires the assessment\nof the impact of multiple factors, such as: model accuracy, training time,\nnetwork overhead, energy consumption, processing latency, among others.This\nreview aims at providing a comprehensive vision of the main state-of-the-art\nlibraries and frameworks for machine learning and data analytics available\ntoday.

    "abstract": "We present incomplete gamma kernels, a generalization of Locally Optimal\nProjection (LOP) operators. In particular, we reveal the relation of the\nclassical localized $ L_1 $ estimator, used in the LOP operator for surface\nreconstruction from noisy point clouds, to the common Mean Shift framework via\na novel kernel. Furthermore, we generalize this result to a whole family of\nkernels that are built upon the incomplete gamma function and each represents a\nlocalized $ L_p $ estimator. By deriving various properties of the kernel\nfamily concerning distributional, Mean Shift induced, and other aspects such as\nstrict positive definiteness, we obtain a deeper understanding of the\noperator's projection behavior. From these theoretical insights, we illustrate\nseveral applications ranging from an improved Weighted LOP (WLOP) density\nweighting scheme and a more accurate Continuous LOP (CLOP) kernel approximation\nto the definition of a novel set of robust loss functions. These incomplete\ngamma losses include the Gaussian and LOP loss as special cases and can be\napplied for reconstruction tasks such as normal filtering. We demonstrate the\neffects of each application in a range of quantitative and qualitative\nexperiments that highlight the benefits induced by our modifications.",

Empirical studies have shown that ensemble\npruning, that is, choosing an appropriate subset of the available classifiers,\ncan lead to comparable or better predictions than using all classifiers. In\nthis paper, we consider a binary classification problem and propose an integer\nprogramming (IP) approach for selecting optimal classifier subsets. We propose\na flexible objective function to adapt to desired criteria of different\ndatasets. We also propose constraints to ensure minimum diversity levels in the\nensemble.

    "abstract": "Objects' motions in nature are governed by complex interactions and their\nproperties. While some properties, such as shape and material, can be\nidentified via the object's visual appearances, others like mass and electric\ncharge are not directly visible. The compositionality between the visible and\nhidden properties poses unique challenges for AI models to reason from the\nphysical world, whereas humans can effortlessly infer them with limited\nobservations. Existing studies on video reasoning mainly focus on visually\nobservable elements such as object appearance, movement, and contact\ninteraction. In this paper, we take an initial step to highlight the importance\nof inferring the hidden physical properties not directly observable from visual\nappearances, by introducing the Compositional Physical Reasoning (ComPhy)\ndataset. For a given set of objects, ComPhy includes few videos of them moving\nand interacting under different initial conditions. The model is evaluated\nbased on its capability to unravel the compositional hidden properties, such as\nmass and charge, and use this knowledge to answer a set of questions posted on\none of the videos. Evaluation results of several state-of-the-art video\nreasoning models on ComPhy show unsatisfactory performance as they fail to\ncapture these hidden properties. We further propose an oracle neural-symbolic\nframework named Compositional Physics Learner (CPL), combining visual\nperception, physical property learning, dynamic prediction, and symbolic\nexecution into a unified framework. CPL can effectively identify objects'\nphysical properties from their interactions and predict their dynamics to\nanswer questions.",

Using the MaxCut problem as the target, we\ndemonstrate numerically that an easier way to implement an alternative phase\noperator can be used in lieu of the phase operator encoding the objective\nfunction, as long as the ground state is the same. We observe that if the\nground state energy is not preserved, the approximation ratio obtained by QAOA\nwith such phase separating operator is likely to decrease. Moreover, we show\nthat a better alignment of the low energy subspace of the alternative operator\nleads to better performance. Leveraging these observations, we propose a\nsparsification strategy that reduces the resource requirements of QAOA.

    "abstract": "Identification of unknown physical processes and parameters of groundwater\ncontaminant sources is a challenging task due to their ill-posed and non-unique\nnature. Numerous works have focused on determining nonlinear physical processes\nthrough model selection methods. However, identifying corresponding nonlinear\nsystems for different physical phenomena using numerical methods can be\ncomputationally prohibitive. With the advent of machine learning (ML)\nalgorithms, more efficient surrogate models based on neural networks (NNs) have\nbeen developed in various disciplines. In this work, a theory-guided U-net\n(TgU-net) framework is proposed for surrogate modeling of three-dimensional\n(3D) groundwater contaminant problems in order to efficiently elucidate their\ninvolved processes and unknown parameters. In TgU-net, the underlying governing\nequations are embedded into the loss function of U-net as soft constraints. For\nthe considered groundwater contaminant problem, sorption is considered to be a\npotential process of an uncertain type, and three equilibrium sorption isotherm\ntypes (i.e., linear, Freundlich, and Langmuir) are considered. Different from\ntraditional approaches in which one model corresponds to one equation, these\nthree sorption types are modeled through only one TgU-net surrogate. The three\nmentioned sorption terms are integrated into one equation by assigning\nindicators. Accurate predictions illustrate the satisfactory generalizability\nand extrapolability of the constructed TgU-net. Furthermore, based on the\nconstructed TgU-net surrogate, a data assimilation method is employed to\nidentify the physical process and parameters simultaneously. This work shows\nthe possibility of governing equation discovery of physical problems that\ncontain multiple and even uncertain processes by using deep learning and data\nassimilation methods.",

We\nprovide a detailed analysis of a computer-free, all-optical imaging method for\nseeing through random, unknown phase diffusers using diffractive neural\nnetworks, covering different deep learning-based training strategies. By\nanalyzing various diffractive networks designed to image through random\ndiffusers with different correlation lengths, a trade-off between the image\nreconstruction fidelity and distortion reduction capability of the diffractive\nnetwork was observed. During its training, random diffusers with a range of\ncorrelation lengths were used to improve the diffractive network's\ngeneralization performance. Increasing the number of random diffusers used in\neach epoch reduced the overfitting of the diffractive network's imaging\nperformance to known diffusers. We also demonstrated that the use of additional\ndiffractive layers improved the generalization capability to see through new,\nrandom diffusers. Finally, we introduced deliberate misalignments in training\nto 'vaccinate' the network against random layer-to-layer shifts that might\narise due to the imperfect assembly of the diffractive networks. These analyses\nprovide a comprehensive guide in designing diffractive networks to see through\nrandom diffusers, which might profoundly impact many fields, such as biomedical\nimaging, atmospheric physics, and autonomous driving.",

Here, we investigate the possibility of\nrealizing a quantum pattern recognition protocol based on swap test, and use\nthe IBMQ noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices to verify the idea. We\nfind that with a two-qubit protocol, swap test can efficiently detect the\nsimilarity between two patterns with good fidelity, though for three or more\nqubits the noise in the real devices becomes detrimental. To mitigate this\nnoise effect, we resort to destructive swap test, which shows an improved\nperformance for three-qubit states. Due to limited cloud access to larger IBMQ\nprocessors, we take a segment-wise approach to apply the destructive swap test\non higher dimensional images. In this case, we define an average overlap\nmeasure which shows faithfulness to distinguish between two very different or\nvery similar patterns when simulated on real IBMQ processors. As test images,\nwe use binary images with simple patterns, greyscale MNIST numbers and MNIST\nfashion images, as well as binary images of human blood vessel obtained from\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We also present an experimental set up for\napplying destructive swap test using the nitrogen vacancy centre (NVs) in\ndiamond.

    "abstract": "Though various approaches have been considered, forecasting near-term market\nchanges of equities and similar market data remains quite difficult. In this\npaper we introduce an approach to forecast near-term market changes for equity\nindices as well as portfolios using variational inference (VI). VI is a machine\nlearning approach which uses optimization techniques to estimate complex\nprobability densities. In the proposed approach, clusters of explanatory\nvariables are identified and market changes are forecast based on\ncluster-specific linear regression. Apart from the expected value of changes,\nthe proposed approach can also be used to obtain the distribution of possible\noutcomes, which can be used to estimate confidence levels of forecasts and risk\nmeasures such as VaR (Value at Risk) for the portfolio. Another advantage of\nthe proposed approach is the clear model interpretation, as clusters of\nexplanatory variables (or market regimes) are identified for which the future\nchanges follow similar relationships. Knowledge about such clusters can provide\nuseful insights about portfolio performance and identify the relative\nimportance of variables in different market regimes. Illustrative examples of\nequity and bond indices are considered to demonstrate forecasts of the proposed\napproach during Covid-related volatility in early 2020 and subsequent benign\nmarket conditions. For the portfolios considered, it is shown that the proposed\napproach provides useful forecasts in both normal and volatile markets even\nwith only a few explanatory variables. Additionally the predicted estimate and\ndistribution adapt quickly to changing market conditions and thus may also be\nuseful in obtaining better real-time estimates of risk measures such as VaR\ncompared to traditional approaches.",

The\nsystem, called Quantum Key Infrastructure (QKI), relies on pre-shared random\nnumbers between QKI clients and a group of Quantum Entropy Managers (QEMs). Any\ngroup of QKI clients can use the QKI protocol to distill from the pre-shared\nnumbers a secret key. The clients are protected from QEM compromise via a\nsecret sharing scheme that allows the creation of the final key without the\nneed to trust individual QEMs. Precisely, if the number of compromised QEMs\ndoes not exceed a certain threshold, confidentiality is guaranteed to QKI\nclients and, at the same time, robustness against denial-of-service (DoS)\nattacks. The QKI system can be used for quantum-secure communication, can be\neasily integrated into existing network infrastructures, and can support\narbitrary groups of communication parties that have access to a key. We discuss\nthe high-level protocol, analyze its security, including its robustness against\ndisruption.

    "abstract": "Fast mixing of random walks on hypergraphs has led to myriad breakthroughs in\ntheoretical computer science in the last five years. On the other hand, many\nimportant applications (e.g. to locally testable codes, 2-2 games) rely on a\nmore general class of underlying structures called posets, and crucially take\nadvantage of non-simplicial structure. These works make it clear the global\nexpansion properties of posets depend strongly on their underlying architecture\n(e.g. simplicial, cubical, linear algebraic), but the overall phenomenon\nremains poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the advantage of different\nposet architectures in both a spectral and combinatorial sense, highlighting\nhow regularity controls the spectral decay and edge-expansion of corresponding\nrandom walks.\nWe show that the spectra of walks on expanding posets (Dikstein, Dinur,\nFilmus, Harsha APPROX-RANDOM 2018) concentrate in strips around a small number\nof approximate eigenvalues controlled by the regularity of the underlying\nposet. This gives a simple condition to identify poset architectures (e.g. the\nGrassmann) that exhibit exponential decay of eigenvalues, versus architectures\nlike hypergraphs whose eigenvalues decay linearly -- a crucial distinction in\napplications to hardness of approximation such as the recent proof of the 2-2\nGames Conjecture (Khot, Minzer, Safra FOCS 2018). We show these results lead to\na tight characterization of edge-expansion on posets in the $\\ell_2$-regime\n(generalizing recent work of Bafna, Hopkins, Kaufman, and Lovett (SODA 2022)),\nand pay special attention to the case of the Grassmann where we show our\nresults are tight for a natural set of sparsifications of the Grassmann graphs.\nWe note for clarity that our results do not recover the characterization of\nexpansion used in the proof of the 2-2 Games Conjecture which relies on\n$\\ell_\\infty$ rather than $\\ell_2$-structure.",

    "abstract": "Epidemics of infectious diseases posing a serious risk to human health have\noccurred throughout history. During the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 epidemic there has\nbeen much debate about policy, including how and when to impose restrictions on\nbehavior. Under such circumstances policymakers must balance a complex spectrum\nof objectives, suggesting a need for quantitative tools. Whether health\nservices might be 'overwhelmed' has emerged as a key consideration yet formal\nmodelling of optimal policy has so far largely ignored this. Here we show how\ncostly interventions, such as taxes or subsidies on behaviour, can be used to\nexactly align individuals' decision making with government preferences even\nwhen these are not aligned. We assume that choices made by individuals give\nrise to Nash equilibrium behavior. We focus on a situation in which the\ncapacity of the healthcare system to treat patients is limited and identify\nconditions under which the disease dynamics respect the capacity limit. In\nparticular we find an extremely sharp drop in peak infections as the maximum\ninfection cost in the government's objective function is increased. This is in\nmarked contrast to the gradual reduction without government intervention. The\ninfection costs at which this switch occurs depend on how costly the\nintervention is to the government. We find optimal interventions that are quite\ndifferent to the case when interventions are cost-free. Finally, we identify a\nnovel analytic solution for the Nash equilibrium behavior for constant\ninfection cost.",

    "abstract": "This article introduces adaptive Fourier decomposition (AFD) type methods,\nemphasizing on those that can be applied to stochastic processes and random\nfields, mainly including stochastic adaptive Fourier decomposition and\nstochastic pre-orthogonal adaptive Fourier decomposition. We establish their\nalgorithms based on the covariant function and prove that they enjoy the same\nconvergence rate as the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) decomposition. The AFD type methods\nare compared with the KL decomposition. In contrast with the latter, the AFD\ntype methods do not need to compute eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the\nkernel-integral operator induced by the covariance function, and thus\nconsiderably reduce the computation complexity and computer consumes. Various\nkinds of dictionaries offer AFD flexibility to solve problems of a great\nvariety, including different types of deterministic and stochastic equations.\nThe conducted experiments show, besides the numerical convenience and fast\nconvergence, that the AFD type decompositions outperform the KL type in\ndescribing local details, in spite of the proven global optimality of the\nlatter.",

    "abstract": "Effective and adaptive interference management is required in next generation\nwireless communication systems. To address this challenge, Rate-Splitting\nMultiple Access (RSMA), relying on multi-antenna rate-splitting (RS) at the\ntransmitter and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receivers,\nhas been intensively studied in recent years, albeit mostly under the\nassumption of perfect Channel State Information at the Receiver (CSIR) and\nideal capacity-achieving modulation and coding schemes. To assess its practical\nperformance, benefits, and limits under more realistic conditions, this work\nproposes a novel design for a practical RSMA receiver based on model-based deep\nlearning (MBDL) methods, which aims to unite the simple structure of the\nconventional SIC receiver and the robustness and model agnosticism of deep\nlearning techniques. The MBDL receiver is evaluated in terms of uncoded Symbol\nError Rate (SER), throughput performance through Link-Level Simulations (LLS),\nand average training overhead. Also, a comparison with the SIC receiver, with\nperfect and imperfect CSIR, is given. Results reveal that the MBDL outperforms\nby a significant margin the SIC receiver with imperfect CSIR, due to its\nability to generate on demand non-linear symbol detection boundaries in a pure\ndata-driven manner.",

    "abstract": "Identifying and mitigating safety risks is paramount in a number of\nindustries. In addition to guidelines and best practices, many industries\nalready have safety management systems (SMSs) designed to monitor and reinforce\ngood safety behaviors. The analytic capabilities to analyze the data acquired\nthrough such systems, however, are still lacking in terms of their ability to\nrobustly quantify risks posed by various occupational hazards. Moreover, best\npractices and modern SMSs are unable to account for dynamically evolving\nenvironments/behavioral characteristics commonly found in many industrial\nsettings. This article proposes a method to address these issues by enabling\ncontinuous and quantitative assessment of safety risks in a data-driven manner.\nThe backbone of our method is an intuitive hierarchical probabilistic model\nthat explains sparse and noisy safety data collected by a typical SMS. A fully\nBayesian approach is developed to calibrate this model from safety data in an\nonline fashion. Thereafter, the calibrated model holds necessary information\nthat serves to characterize risk posed by different safety hazards.\nAdditionally, the proposed model can be leveraged for automated decision\nmaking, for instance solving resource allocation problems -- targeted towards\nrisk mitigation -- that are often encountered in resource-constrained\nindustrial environments. The methodology is rigorously validated on a simulated\ntest-bed and its scalability is demonstrated on real data from large\nmaintenance projects at a petrochemical plant.",

Although the full space of probability distributions\ncannot be ordered, a properly restricted subset of distributions can be totally\nordered in a practically meaningful way. We call these loss-distributions,\nsince they provide a substitute for the concept of loss-functions in decision\ntheory.

    "abstract": "Previous electroencephalogram (EEG) emotion recognition relies on single-task\nlearning, which may lead to overfitting and learned emotion features lacking\ngeneralization. In this paper, a graph-based multi-task self-supervised\nlearning model (GMSS) for EEG emotion recognition is proposed. GMSS has the\nability to learn more general representations by integrating multiple\nself-supervised tasks, including spatial and frequency jigsaw puzzle tasks, and\ncontrastive learning tasks. By learning from multiple tasks simultaneously,\nGMSS can find a representation that captures all of the tasks thereby\ndecreasing the chance of overfitting on the original task, i.e., emotion\nrecognition task. In particular, the spatial jigsaw puzzle task aims to capture\nthe intrinsic spatial relationships of different brain regions. Considering the\nimportance of frequency information in EEG emotional signals, the goal of the\nfrequency jigsaw puzzle task is to explore the crucial frequency bands for EEG\nemotion recognition. To further regularize the learned features and encourage\nthe network to learn inherent representations, contrastive learning task is\nadopted in this work by mapping the transformed data into a common feature\nspace. The performance of the proposed GMSS is compared with several popular\nunsupervised and supervised methods. Experiments on SEED, SEED-IV, and MPED\ndatasets show that the proposed model has remarkable advantages in learning\nmore discriminative and general features for EEG emotional signals.",
