    "abstract": "Analysis of the dynamic relationship between traffic accident events and road\nnetwork topology based on connectivity and graph analytics offers a new\napproach to identifying, ranking and profiling traffic accident high\nrisk-locations at different levels of space and time granularities. Previous\nstudies on traffic accident hot spots have mostly adopted spatial statistics\nand Geographic Information Systems (GIS) where spatial point patterns are\ndiscovered based only on spatial dependence with no recognition of the temporal\ndependence of the events. A limitation arises from the fact that the results\nare either under or over-estimated because of the temporal aggregation of the\nevents to an absolute time point. Furthermore, the existing methods apart from\nthe Network Kernel Density Estimation (NETKDE), consider traffic accident\nevents as events randomly on a 2-D geographic space. However, traffic accident\nevents are network constrained events that happens majorly on the road network\nspace. Therefore, in this paper, we adopt the connectivity of graph on a\nnetwork space approach that identifies accident high risk-locations based on\nspace-time-varying connectivity between traffic accident events and the road\nnetwork geometry. A simple but extensible traffic accident space time-varying\ngraph (STVG) model is developed and implemented for this study. Traffic\naccident high risk-locations are identified and ranked in space and time using\ntime-dependent degree centrality and PageRank centrality graph metrics\nrespectively through time-incremental graph queries. This study offers urban\ntraffic accident analysts with a new and efficient approach to identify, rank\nand profile accident-prone areas in space and time at different scales.",

    "abstract": "Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned as a promising\ntechnology for future wireless communications. With various hardware\nrealizations, RISs can work under different modes\n(reflective/transmissive/hybrid) or have different architectures\n(single-/group-/fully-connected). However, most existing research focused on\neither reflective RISs or single-connected hybrid RISs while there is lack of a\ncomprehensive study for RISs unifying different modes/architectures. In this\npaper, we solve this issue by analyzing and proposing a general RIS-aided\ncommunication model which unifies the reflective/transmissive/hybrid modes and\nsingle-/group-/fullyconnected architectures. With the proposed model, we\nconsider jointly designing the transmit precoder and RIS beamformer to maximize\nthe sum-rate for RIS-aided systems. Leveraging fractional programming theory,\nthe original sum-rate maximization problem is equivalently transformed into a\nmulti-block optimization, which can be solved by block coordinate descent\nmethods. We also provide simulation results to compare the performance of RISs\nwith different modes/architectures. Compared with singleconnected hybrid RISs,\nfully- and group-connected hybrid RISs can increase the sum-rate by around 75%\nand 37% for Rayleigh fading channels.",

However, what\nhappens to learned word representations with distribution shifts remains\nunclear. Recently, the BEIR benchmark was introduced to assess the performance\nof neural rankers in zero-shot settings and revealed deficiencies for several\nmodels. In complement to BEIR, we propose to control \\textit{explicitly}\ndistribution shifts. We selected different query subsets leading to different\ndistribution shifts: short versus long queries, wh-words types of queries and 5\ntopic-based clusters. Then, we benchmarked state of the art neural rankers such\nas dense Bi-Encoder, SPLADE and ColBERT under these different training and test\nconditions.

The Metaverse provides ample\nopportunities for the creation of environments in which such experiential\nlearning can occur. In this work, we introduce a novel architecture that\ncombines Artificial intelligence and Virtual Reality to create a highly\nimmersive and efficient learning experience using avatars. The framework allows\nus to measure the interpersonal effectiveness of an individual interacting with\nthe avatar. We first present a small pilot study and its results which were\nused to enhance the framework. We then present a larger study using the\nenhanced framework to measure, assess, and predict the interpersonal\neffectiveness of individuals interacting with an avatar. Results reveal that\nindividuals with deficits in their interpersonal effectiveness show a\nsignificant improvement in performance after multiple interactions with an\navatar. The results also reveal that individuals interact naturally with\navatars within this framework, and exhibit similar behavioral traits as they\nwould in the real world. We use this as a basis to analyze the underlying audio\nand video data streams of individuals during these interactions. Finally, we\nextract relevant features from these data and present a machine-learning based\napproach to predict interpersonal effectiveness during human-avatar\nconversation. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings to\nbuild beneficial applications for the real world.",

However, unlike LF encodings, Dedukti\nencodings proposed until now do not feature an adequacy theorem -- i.e., a\nbijection between terms in the encoded system and in its encoding. Moreover,\nmany of them also do not have a conservativity result, which compromises the\nability of Dedukti to check proofs written in such encodings. We propose a\ndifferent approach for Dedukti encodings which do not only allow for simpler\nconservativity proofs, but which also restore the adequacy of encodings. More\nprecisely, we propose in this work adequate (and thus conservative) encodings\nfor Functional Pure Type Systems.

    "abstract": "The success of deep learning depends heavily on the availability of large\ndatasets, but in robotic manipulation there are many learning problems for\nwhich such datasets do not exist. Collecting these datasets is time-consuming\nand expensive, and therefore learning from small datasets is an important open\nproblem. Within computer vision, a common approach to a lack of data is data\naugmentation. Data augmentation is the process of creating additional training\nexamples by modifying existing ones. However, because the types of tasks and\ndata differ, the methods used in computer vision cannot be easily adapted to\nmanipulation. Therefore, we propose a data augmentation method for robotic\nmanipulation. We argue that augmentations should be valid, relevant, and\ndiverse. We use these principles to formalize augmentation as an optimization\nproblem, with the objective function derived from physics and knowledge of the\nmanipulation domain. This method applies rigid body transformations to\ntrajectories of geometric state and action data. We test our method in two\nscenarios: 1) learning the dynamics of planar pushing of rigid cylinders, and\n2) learning a constraint checker for rope manipulation. These two scenarios\nhave different data and label types, yet in both scenarios, training on our\naugmented data significantly improves performance on downstream tasks. We also\nshow how our augmentation method can be used on real-robot data to enable more\ndata-efficient online learning.",

The framework is based on reducing\nthe neural aspect to a prediction of a matrix for a single given point,\nconditioned on a global shape descriptor. The field of matrices is then\nprojected onto the tangent bundle of the given mesh, and used as candidate\njacobians for the predicted map. The map is computed by a standard Poisson\nsolve, implemented as a differentiable layer with cached pre-factorization for\nefficient training. This construction is agnostic to the triangulation of the\ninput, thereby enabling applications on datasets with varying triangulations.\nAt the same time, by operating in the intrinsic gradient domain of each\nindividual mesh, it allows the framework to predict highly-accurate mappings.\nWe validate these properties by conducting experiments over a broad range of\nscenarios, from semantic ones such as morphing, registration, and deformation\ntransfer, to optimization-based ones, such as emulating elastic deformations\nand contact correction, as well as being the first work, to our knowledge, to\ntackle the task of learning to compute UV parameterizations of arbitrary\nmeshes.

    "abstract": "The production, shipping, usage, and disposal of consumer goods have a\nsubstantial impact on greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of resources.\nModern retail platforms rely heavily on Machine Learning (ML) for their search\nand recommender systems. Thus, ML can potentially support efforts towards more\nsustainable consumption patterns, for example, by accounting for sustainability\naspects in product search or recommendations. However, leveraging ML potential\nfor reaching sustainability goals requires data on sustainability.\nUnfortunately, no open and publicly available database integrates\nsustainability information on a product-by-product basis. In this work, we\npresent the GreenDB, which fills this gap. Based on search logs of millions of\nusers, we prioritize which products users care about most. The GreenDB schema\nextends the well-known schema.org Product definition and can be readily\nintegrated into existing product catalogs to improve sustainability information\navailable for search and recommendation experiences. We present our proof of\nconcept implementation of a scraping system that creates the GreenDB dataset.",

    "abstract": "Modeling and manipulating elasto-plastic objects are essential capabilities\nfor robots to perform complex industrial and household interaction tasks (e.g.,\nstuffing dumplings, rolling sushi, and making pottery). However, due to the\nhigh degree of freedom of elasto-plastic objects, significant challenges exist\nin virtually every aspect of the robotic manipulation pipeline, e.g.,\nrepresenting the states, modeling the dynamics, and synthesizing the control\nsignals. We propose to tackle these challenges by employing a particle-based\nrepresentation for elasto-plastic objects in a model-based planning framework.\nOur system, RoboCraft, only assumes access to raw RGBD visual observations. It\ntransforms the sensing data into particles and learns a particle-based dynamics\nmodel using graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the structure of the\nunderlying system. The learned model can then be coupled with model-predictive\ncontrol (MPC) algorithms to plan the robot's behavior. We show through\nexperiments that with just 10 minutes of real-world robotic interaction data,\nour robot can learn a dynamics model that can be used to synthesize control\nsignals to deform elasto-plastic objects into various target shapes, including\nshapes that the robot has never encountered before. We perform systematic\nevaluations in both simulation and the real world to demonstrate the robot's\nmanipulation capabilities and ability to generalize to a more complex action\nspace, different tool shapes, and a mixture of motion modes. We also conduct\ncomparisons between RoboCraft and untrained human subjects controlling the\ngripper to manipulate deformable objects in both simulation and the real world.\nOur learned model-based planning framework is comparable to and sometimes\nbetter than human subjects on the tested tasks.",

    "abstract": "This paper approaches the unsupervised learning problem by gradient descent\nin the space of probability density functions. Our main result shows that along\nthe gradient flow induced by a distribution-dependent ordinary differential\nequation (ODE), the unknown data distribution emerges as the long-time limit of\nthis flow of densities. That is, one can uncover the data distribution by\nsimulating the distribution-dependent ODE. Intriguingly, we find that the\nsimulation of the ODE is equivalent to the training of generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs). The GAN framework, by definition a non-cooperative game\nbetween a generator and a discriminator, can therefore be viewed alternatively\nas a cooperative game between a navigator and a calibrator (in collaboration to\nsimulate the ODE). At the theoretic level, this new perspective simplifies the\nanalysis of GANs and gives new insight into their performance. To construct a\nsolution to the distribution-dependent ODE, we first show that the associated\nnonlinear Fokker-Planck equation has a unique weak solution, using the\nCrandall-Liggett theorem for differential equations in Banach spaces. From this\nsolution to the Fokker-Planck equation, we construct a unique solution to the\nODE, relying on Trevisan's superposition principle. The convergence of the\ninduced gradient flow to the data distribution is obtained by analyzing the\nFokker-Planck equation.",

    "abstract": "Scenario-based testing for automated driving systems (ADS) must be able to\nsimulate traffic scenarios that rely on interactions with other vehicles.\nAlthough many languages for high-level scenario modelling have been proposed,\nthey lack the features to precisely and reliably control the required\nmicro-simulation, while also supporting behavior reuse and test reproducibility\nfor a wide range of interactive scenarios. To fill this gap between scenario\ndesign and execution, we propose the Simulated Driver-Vehicle Model (SDV) to\nrepresent and simulate vehicles as dynamic entities with their behavior being\nconstrained by scenario design and goals set by testers. The model combines\ndriver and vehicle as a single entity. It is based on human-like driving and\nthe mechanical limitations of real vehicles for realistic simulation. The\nlayered architecture of the model leverages behavior trees to express\nhigh-level behaviors in terms of lower-level maneuvers, affording multiple\ndriving styles and reuse. Further, optimization-based maneuver planner guides\nthe simulated vehicles towards the desired behavior. Our extensive evaluation\nshows the model's design effectiveness using NHTSA pre-crash scenarios, its\nmotion realism in comparison to naturalistic urban traffic, and its scalability\nwith traffic density. Finally, we show the applicability of SDV model to test a\nreal ADS and to identify crash scenarios, which are impractical to represent\nusing predefined vehicle trajectories.

First,\na fatigue progressive damage model (PDM) incorporating multiaxial fatigue\nresidual strength degradation rule, fatigue failure criteria based on fatigue\nresidual strength concept and sudden stiffness degradation rule was proposed.\nThen, an LVI progressive damage model for plain-weave (PW) and unidirectional\n(UD) composites was developed. Moreover, a full-process analysis algorithm with\na reasonable damage transfer strategy for pre-fatigue, LVI and fatigue\nprogressive damage analysis was proposed. Finally, a highly computational\nefficient and accurate full-scale global-local finite element (FE) model of\nhelicopter tail structure was built to predict strain distribution under two\nflight working conditions, to predict LVI damage under impact loading, and to\nassess fatigue damage behaviours under multipoint coordinated loading spectrum.\nThe numerical predictions agree well with test results from this work and\nliterature data, indicating that the developed pre-fatigue, LVI, fatigue PDMs\nand algorithms, as well as the global-local FE modelling based on\nshell-to-solid coupling, can effectively analyse the impact damage tolerance of\nfull-scale aircraft structures.",

Despite recent advances\nin machine learning and precision oncology, this approach remains challenging\nas collecting data in preclinical/clinical studies for modeling multiple\ntreatment efficacies is often an expensive, time-consuming process. Moreover,\nthe randomization in treatment allocation proves to be suboptimal since some\nparticipants/samples are not receiving the most appropriate treatments during\nthe trial. To address this challenge, we formulate drug screening study as a\n\"contextual bandit\" problem, in which an algorithm selects anticancer\ntherapeutics based on contextual information about cancer cell lines while\nadapting its treatment strategy to maximize treatment response in an \"online\"\nfashion. We propose using a novel deep Bayesian bandits framework that uses\nfunctional prior to approximate posterior for drug response prediction based on\nmulti-modal information consisting of genomic features and drug structure.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution to enable many AI\napplications, where sensitive datasets from distributed clients are needed for\ncollaboratively training a global model. FL allows the clients to participate\nin the training phase, governed by a central server, without sharing their\nlocal data. One of the main challenges of FL is the communication overhead,\nwhere the model updates of the participating clients are sent to the central\nserver at each global training round. Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has\nbeen recently proposed to alleviate the communication bottleneck where the\nmodel updates are sent simultaneously over the multiple-access channel.\nHowever, simple averaging of the model updates via AirComp makes the learning\nprocess vulnerable to random or intended modifications of the local model\nupdates of some Byzantine clients. In this paper, we propose a transmission and\naggregation framework to reduce the effect of such attacks while preserving the\nbenefits of AirComp for FL. For the proposed robust approach, the central\nserver divides the participating clients randomly into groups and allocates a\ntransmission time slot for each group. The updates of the different groups are\nthen aggregated using a robust aggregation technique. We extend our approach to\nhandle the case of non-i.i.d. local data, where a resampling step is added\nbefore robust aggregation. We analyze the convergence of the proposed approach\nfor both cases of i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. data and demonstrate that the proposed\nalgorithm converges at a linear rate to a neighborhood of the optimal solution.\nExperiments on real datasets are provided to confirm the robustness of the\nproposed approach.",

Analogous to racing being used\nto test cutting-edge vehicles, we envision autonomous racing to serve as a\nparticularly challenging proving ground for autonomous agents as: (i) they need\nto make sub-second, safety-critical decisions in a complex, fast-changing\nenvironment; and (ii) both perception and control must be robust to\ndistribution shifts, novel road features, and unseen obstacles. Thus, the main\ngoal of the challenge is to evaluate the joint safety, performance, and\ngeneralisation capabilities of reinforcement learning agents on multi-modal\nperception, through a two-stage process. In the first stage of the challenge,\nwe evaluate an autonomous agent's ability to drive as fast as possible, while\nadhering to safety constraints. In the second stage, we additionally require\nthe agent to adapt to an unseen racetrack through safe exploration.

    "abstract": "Approximate convex decomposition aims to decompose a 3D shape into a set of\nalmost convex components, whose convex hulls can then be used to represent the\ninput shape. It thus enables efficient geometry processing algorithms\nspecifically designed for convex shapes and has been widely used in game\nengines, physics simulations, and animation. While prior works can capture the\nglobal structure of input shapes, they may fail to preserve fine-grained\ndetails (e.g., filling a toaster's slots), which are critical for retaining the\nfunctionality of objects in interactive environments. In this paper, we propose\na novel method that addresses the limitations of existing approaches from three\nperspectives: (a) We introduce a novel collision-aware concavity metric that\nexamines the distance between a shape and its convex hull from both the\nboundary and the interior. The proposed concavity preserves collision\nconditions and is more robust to detect various approximation errors. (b) We\ndecompose shapes by directly cutting meshes with 3D planes. It ensures\ngenerated convex hulls are intersection-free and avoids voxelization errors.\n(c) Instead of using a one-step greedy strategy, we propose employing a\nmulti-step tree search to determine the cutting planes, which leads to a\nglobally better solution and avoids unnecessary cuttings. Through extensive\nevaluation on a large-scale articulated object dataset, we show that our method\ngenerates decompositions closer to the original shape with fewer components. It\nthus supports delicate and efficient object interaction in downstream\napplications. We will release our implementation to facilitate future research.",

Such techniques protect\nsensed data from external adversaries while assuming that the sensing device\nitself is secure. Meanwhile, both the scale and frequency of IoT-focused\nattacks are growing. This prompts a natural question: how to protect sensed\ndata even if all software on the device is compromised? Ideally, in order to\nachieve this, sensed data must be protected from its genesis, i.e., from the\ntime when a physical analog quantity is converted into its digital counterpart\nand becomes accessible to software. We refer to this property as PfB:\nPrivacy-from-Birth.\nIn this work, we formalize PfB and design Verified Remote Sensing\nAuthorization (VERSA) -- a provably secure and formally verified architecture\nguaranteeing that only correct execution of expected and explicitly authorized\nsoftware can access and manipulate sensing interfaces, specifically, General\nPurpose Input/Output (GPIO), which is the usual boundary between analog and\ndigital worlds on IoT devices. This guarantee is obtained with minimal hardware\nsupport and holds even if all device software is compromised. VERSA ensures\nthat malware can neither gain access to sensed data on the GPIO-mapped memory\nnor obtain any trace thereof.

Training models with DP\nprotects the model against leakage of sensitive data in a potentially\nadversarial setting. In the field of deep learning, Differentially Private\nStochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) has emerged as a popular private training\nalgorithm. Private training using DP-SGD protects against leakage by injecting\nnoise into individual example gradients, such that the trained model weights\nbecome nearly independent of the use any particular training example. While\nthis result is quite appealing, the computational cost of training large-scale\nmodels with DP-SGD is substantially higher than non-private training. This is\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that increasing the number of parameters leads\nto larger degradation in utility with DP. In this work, we zoom in on the\nImageNet dataset and demonstrate that similar to the non-private case,\npre-training over-parameterized models on a large public dataset can lead to\nsubstantial gains when the model is finetuned privately. Moreover, by\nsystematically comparing private and non-private models across a range of huge\nbatch sizes, we find that similar to non-private setting, choice of optimizer\ncan further improve performance substantially with DP.

This paper presents a sliding mode control (SMC) design\napproach for nonlinear systems with partially known dynamics by blending\ndata-driven and model-based approaches. First, an SMC is designed for the\navailable (nominal) model of the nonlinear system. The closed-loop state\ntrajectory of the available model is used to build the desired trajectory for\nthe partially known nonlinear system states. Next, a deep policy gradient\nmethod is used to cope with unknown parts of the system dynamics and adjust the\nsliding mode control output to achieve a desired state trajectory.

The existing GS-PG method was designed to\nlearn from complete episodes or process trajectories, which limits its\napplicability to low-data environment and online process control. In this\npaper, the mixture likelihood ratio (MLR) based policy gradient estimation is\nused to leverage the information from historical state decision transitions\ngenerated under different behavioral policies. We propose a variance reduction\nexperience replay (VRER) approach that can intelligently select and reuse most\nrelevant transition observations, improve the policy gradient estimation\naccuracy, and accelerate the learning of optimal policy. Then we create a\nprocess control strategy by incorporating VRER with the state-of-the-art\nstep-based policy optimization approaches such as actor-critic method and\nproximal policy optimizations. The empirical study demonstrates that the\nproposed policy gradient methodology can significantly outperform the existing\npolicy optimization approaches.",

Therefore, this paper models the registration problem as\nmulti-task optimization, and proposes a novel bi-channel knowledge sharing\nmechanism for effective and efficient problem solving. The modeling of\nmulti-view point cloud registration as multi-task optimization are twofold. By\nsimultaneously considering the local accuracy of two point clouds as well as\nthe global consistency posed by all the point clouds involved, a fitness\nfunction with an adaptive threshold is derived. Also a framework of the\nco-evolutionary search process is defined for the concurrent optimization of\nmultiple fitness functions belonging to related tasks. To enhance solution\nquality and convergence speed, the proposed bi-channel knowledge sharing\nmechanism plays its role. The intra-task knowledge sharing introduces aiding\ntasks that are much simpler to solve, and useful information is shared within\ntasks, accelerating the search process. The inter-task knowledge sharing\nexplores commonalities buried among tasks, aiming to prevent tasks from getting\nstuck to local optima.

    "abstract": "Despite the success of deep learning in speech recognition, multi-dialect\nspeech recognition remains a difficult problem. Although dialect-specific\nacoustic models are known to perform well in general, they are not easy to\nmaintain when dialect-specific data is scarce and the number of dialects for\neach language is large. Therefore, a single unified acoustic model (AM) that\ngeneralizes well for many dialects has been in demand. In this paper, we\npropose a novel acoustic modeling technique for accurate multi-dialect speech\nrecognition with a single AM. Our proposed AM is dynamically adapted based on\nboth dialect information and its internal representation, which results in a\nhighly adaptive AM for handling multiple dialects simultaneously. We also\npropose a simple but effective training method to deal with unseen dialects.\nThe experimental results on large scale speech datasets show that the proposed\nAM outperforms all the previous ones, reducing word error rates (WERs) by 8.11%\nrelative compared to a single all-dialects AM and by 7.31% relative compared to\ndialect-specific AMs.",

Such surgical activity has been shown to\naffect long-term patient outcomes. To better understand this relationship,\nwhose mechanics remain unknown for the majority of surgical procedures, we\nhypothesize that the core elements of surgery must first be quantified in a\nreliable, objective, and scalable manner. We believe this is a prerequisite for\nthe provision of surgical feedback and modulation of surgeon performance in\npursuit of improved patient outcomes. To holistically quantify surgeries, we\npropose a unified deep learning framework, entitled Roboformer, which operates\nexclusively on videos recorded during surgery to independently achieve multiple\ntasks: surgical phase recognition (the what of surgery), gesture classification\nand skills assessment (the how of surgery). We validated our framework on four\nvideo-based datasets of two commonly-encountered types of steps (dissection and\nsuturing) within minimally-invasive robotic surgeries. We demonstrated that our\nframework can generalize well to unseen videos, surgeons, medical centres, and\nsurgical procedures. We also found that our framework, which naturally lends\nitself to explainable findings, identified relevant information when achieving\na particular task.

    "abstract": "It is a challenging research endeavor to infer causal relationships in\nmultivariate observational time-series. Such data may be represented by graphs,\nwhere nodes represent time-series, and edges directed causal influence scores\nbetween them. If the number of nodes exceeds the number of temporal\nobservations, conventional methods, such as standard Granger causality, are of\nlimited value, because estimating free parameters of time-series predictors\nlead to underdetermined problems. A typical example for this situation is\nfunctional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), where the number of nodal\nobservations is large, usually ranging from $10^2$ to $10^5$ time-series, while\nthe number of temporal observations is low, usually less than $10^3$. Hence,\ninnovative approaches are required to address the challenges arising from such\ndata sets. Recently, we have proposed the large-scale Extended Granger\nCausality (lsXGC) algorithm, which is based on augmenting a\ndimensionality-reduced representation of the system's state-space by\nsupplementing data from the conditional source time-series taken from the\noriginal input space. Here, we apply lsXGC on synthetic fMRI data with known\nground truth and compare its performance to state-of-the-art methods by\nleveraging the benefits of information-theoretic approaches. Our results\nsuggest that the proposed lsXGC method significantly outperforms existing\nmethods, both in diagnostic accuracy with Area Under the Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic (AUROC = $0.849$ vs.~$[0.727, 0.762]$ for competing methods,\n$p<\\!10^{-8}$), and computation time ($3.4$ sec vs.~[$9.7$, $4.8 \\times 10^3$]\nsec for competing methods) benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of lsXGC for\nanalyzing large-scale networks in neuroimaging studies of the human brain.",

    "abstract": "In secure machine learning inference, most current schemes assume that the\nserver is semi-honest and honestly follows the protocol but attempts to infer\nadditional information. However, in real-world scenarios, the server may behave\nmaliciously, e.g., using low-quality model parameters as inputs or deviating\nfrom the protocol. Although a few studies consider the security against the\nmalicious server, they do not guarantee the model accuracy while preserving the\nprivacy of both server's model and the client's inputs. Furthermore, a curious\nclient may perform model extraction attacks to steal the server's model.\nTo address these issues, we propose Fusion, an efficient and\nprivacy-preserving inference scheme that is secure against the malicious\nserver, and a curious client who may perform model extraction attacks. Without\nleveraging expensive cryptographic techniques, a novel mix-and-check method is\ndesigned to ensure that the server uses a well-trained model as input and\ncorrectly performs the inference computations. On the basis of this method,\nFusion can be used as a general compiler for converting any semi-honest\ninference scheme into a maliciously secure one. The experimental results\nindicate that Fusion is 93.51$\\times$ faster and uses 30.90$\\times$ less\ncommunication than the existing maliciously secure inference protocol. We\nconduct ImageNet-scale inference on practical ResNet50 model and it costs less\nthan 5.5 minutes and 10.117 Gb of communication, which only brings additional\n29% runtime and has 2.643$\\times$ less communication than that of semi-honest\nCrypTFlow2. Moreover, Fusion mitigates the client's model extraction attacks,\ne.g., degrading the accuracy of the stolen model by up to 42.7% while\nmaintaining the utility of the server's model.",

It applies to systems whose set of initial\nconfigurations is regular, and whose transition relation is captured by a\nlength-preserving transducer. To verify safety properties, regular model\nchecking iteratively computes automata recognizing increasingly larger regular\nsets of reachable configurations, and checks if they contain unsafe\nconfigurations. Since this procedure often does not terminate, acceleration,\nabstraction, and widening techniques have been developed to compute a regular\nsuperset of the set of reachable configurations.\nIn this paper we develop a complementary approach. Instead of approaching the\nset of reachable configurations from below, we start with the set of all\nconfigurations and compute increasingly smaller regular supersets of it. We use\nthat the set of reachable configurations is equal to the intersection of all\ninductive invariants of the system. Since the intersection is in general\nnon-regular, we introduce $b$-bounded invariants, defined as those\nrepresentable by CNF-formulas with at most $b$ clauses. We prove that, for\nevery $b \\geq 0$, the intersection of all $b$-bounded inductive invariants is\nregular, and show how to construct an automaton recognizing it.

Such\nreasoning using combinations of spatial and non-spatial criteria pertinent to\nplace-related questions is increasingly possible on linked data knowledge\nbases. Yet, to enable question answering based on linked knowledge bases,\nnatural language questions must first be re-formulated as formal queries. Here,\nwe first present an enhanced version of YAGO2geo, the geospatially-enabled\nvariant of the YAGO2 knowledge base, by linking and adding more than one\nmillion places from OpenStreetMap data to YAGO2. We then propose a novel\napproach to translate the place-related questions into logical representations,\ntheoretically grounded in the core concepts of spatial information. Next, we\nuse a dynamic template-based approach to generate fully executable GeoSPARQL\nqueries from the logical representations. We test our approach using the\nGeospatial Gold Standard dataset and report substantial improvements over\nexisting methods.",

    "abstract": "False news that spreads on social media has proliferated over the past years\nand has led to multi-aspect threats in the real world. While there are studies\nof false news on specific domains (like politics or health care), little work\nis found comparing false news across domains. In this article, we investigate\nfalse news across nine domains on Weibo, the largest Twitter-like social media\nplatform in China, from 2009 to 2019. The newly collected data comprise 44,728\nposts in the nine domains, published by 40,215 users, and reposted over 3.4\nmillion times. Based on the distributions and spreads of the multi-domain\ndataset, we observe that false news in domains that are close to daily life\nlike health and medicine generated more posts but diffused less effectively\nthan those in other domains like politics, and that political false news had\nthe most effective capacity for diffusion. The widely diffused false news posts\non Weibo were associated strongly with certain types of users -- by gender,\nage, etc. Further, these posts provoked strong emotions in the reposts and\ndiffused further with the active engagement of false-news starters. Our\nfindings have the potential to help design false news detection systems in\nsuspicious news discovery, veracity prediction, and display and explanation.\nThe comparison of the findings on Weibo with those of existing work\ndemonstrates nuanced patterns, suggesting the need for more research on data\nfrom diverse platforms, countries, or languages to tackle the global issue of\nfalse news.

Task offloading is a key part of edge computing\nthat can provide computing resources for resource-constrained devices to run\ncomputing-intensive applications, accelerate computing speed and save energy.\nAn efficient and feasible task offloading scheme can not only greatly improve\nthe quality of experience (QoE) but also provide strong support and assistance\nfor 5G/B5G networks, the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), computing\nnetworks and so on. To achieve these goals, this paper proposes an adaptive\nedge task offloading scheme assisted by service deployment (SD-AETO) focusing\non the optimization of the energy utilization ratio (EUR) and the processing\nlatency. In the pre-implementation stage of the SD-AETO scheme, a service\ndeployment scheme is invoked to assist with task offloading considering each\nservice's popularity. The optimal service deployment scheme is obtained by\nusing the approximate deployment graph (AD-graph). Furthermore, a task\nscheduling and queue offloading design procedure is proposed to complete the\nSD-AETO scheme based on the task priority. The task priority is generated by\nthe corresponding service popularity and task offloading direction. Finally, we\nanalyze our SD-AETO scheme and compare it with related approaches, and the\nresults show that our scheme has a higher edge offloading rate and lower\nresource consumption for massive task scenarios in the edge network.",

    "abstract": "Diversity techniques have been applied for decades to overcome the effects of\nfading, which is one of the most challenging problems in wireless\ncommunications due to the randomness of the wireless channel. However, existing\ndiversity techniques are resource-inefficient due to orthogonal resource usage,\nor they have high-power consumption due to multiple antennas and RF-chains\nwhich present an insurmountable constraint for small devices. To address this,\nthis letter proposes a novel resource-efficient diversity technique called\npower-time channel diversity (PTCD). In PTCD, interleaved copies of the\nbaseband symbols are transmitted simultaneously with weighted power\ncoefficients. The PTCD provides a diversity order of the number of copies by\nimplementing successive interference canceler at the receiver. To achieve this\ndiversity, no additional resources are needed; hence, spectral efficient\ncommunication is guaranteed. Additionally, the power consumption at the\ntransceivers is limited since the PTCD requires only one RF-chain. We provide\nan information-theoretic proof that the PTCD could have any diversity order.\nBased on extensive simulations, we reveal that PTCD can also outperform\nbenchmarks without any additional cost.",

Fake\nnews can seriously impact society in many fields including politics, finance,\nsports, etc. Many studies have been conducted to help detect fake news in\nEnglish, but research conducted on fake news detection in the Arabic language\nis scarce. Our contribution is twofold: first, we have constructed a large and\ndiverse Arabic fake news dataset. Second, we have developed and evaluated\ntransformer-based classifiers to identify fake news while utilizing eight\nstate-of-the-art Arabic contextualized embedding models. The majority of these\nmodels had not been previously used for Arabic fake news detection. We conduct\na thorough analysis of the state-of-the-art Arabic contextualized embedding\nmodels as well as comparison with similar fake news detection systems.\nExperimental results confirm that these state-of-the-art models are robust,\nwith accuracy exceeding 98%.",

    "abstract": "With the gradual deployment of 5G and the continuous popularization of edge\nintelligence (EI), the explosive growth of data on the edge of the network has\npromoted the rapid development of 6G and ubiquitous intelligence (UbiI). This\narticle aims to explore a new method for modeling latency guarantees for UbiI\nin 6G given 6G's extremely stochastic nature in terahertz (THz) environments,\nTHz channel tail behavior, and delay distribution tail characteristics\ngenerated by the UBiI random component, and to find the optimal solution that\nminimizes the end-to-end (E2E) delay of UbiI. In this article, the arrival\ncurve and service curve of network calculus can well characterize the\nstochastic nature of wireless channels, the tail behavior of wireless systems\nand the E2E service curve of network calculus can model the tail characteristic\nof the delay distribution in UbiI. Specifically, we first propose demands and\nchallenges facing 6G, edge computing (EC), edge deep learning (DL), and UbiI.\nThen, we propose the hierarchical architecture, the network model, and the\nservice delay model of the UbiI system based on network calculus. In addition,\ntwo case studies demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the network\ncalculus approach in analyzing and modeling the latency guarantee for UbiI in\n6G. Finally, future open research issues regarding the latency guarantee for\nUbiI in 6G are outlined.",

    "abstract": "Cardiorespiratory fitness is an established predictor of metabolic disease\nand mortality. Fitness is directly measured as maximal oxygen consumption\n(VO2max), or indirectly assessed using heart rate response to a standard\nexercise test. However, such testing is costly and burdensome, limiting its\nutility and scalability. Fitness can also be approximated using resting heart\nrate and self-reported exercise habits but with lower accuracy. Modern\nwearables capture dynamic heart rate data which, in combination with machine\nlearning models, could improve fitness prediction.\nIn this work, we analyze movement and heart rate signals from wearable\nsensors in free-living conditions from 11,059 participants who also underwent a\nstandard exercise test, along with a longitudinal repeat cohort of 2,675\nparticipants. We design algorithms and models that convert raw sensor data into\ncardio-respiratory fitness estimates, and validate these estimates' ability to\ncapture fitness profiles in a longitudinal cohort over time while subjects\nengaged in real-world (non-exercise) behaviour. Additionally, we validate our\nmethods with a third external cohort of 181 participants who underwent maximal\nVO2max testing, which is considered the gold standard measurement because it\nrequires reaching one's maximum heart rate and exhaustion level.\nOur results show that the developed models yield a high correlation (r =\n0.82, 95CI 0.80-0.83), when compared to the ground truth in a holdout sample.\nThese models outperform conventional non-exercise fitness models and\ntraditional bio-markers using measurements of normal daily living without the\nneed for a specific exercise test. Additionally, we show the adaptability and\napplicability of this approach for detecting fitness change over time in the\nlongitudinal subsample that repeated measurements after 7 years.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study economic model predictive control (MPC) in situations\nwhere the optimal operating behavior is periodic. In such a setting, the\nperformance of a plain economic MPC scheme without terminal conditions can\ngenerally be far from optimal even with arbitrarily long prediction horizons.\nWhereas there are modified economic MPC schemes that guarantee optimal\nperformance, all of them are based on prior knowledge of the optimal period\nlength or of the optimal periodic orbit itself. In contrast to these\napproaches, we propose to achieve optimality by multiplying the stage cost by a\nlinear discount factor. This modification is not only easy to implement but\nalso independent of any system- or cost-specific properties, making the scheme\nrobust against online changes therein. Under standard dissipativity and\ncontrollability assumptions, we can prove that the resulting linearly\ndiscounted economic MPC without terminal conditions achieves optimal asymptotic\naverage performance up to an error that vanishes with growing prediction\nhorizons. Moreover, we can guarantee practical asymptotic stability of the\noptimal periodic orbit under slightly stronger assumptions. We complement these\nqualitative guarantees with a quantitative analysis of the transient and\nasymptotic average performance of the linearly discounted MPC scheme in a\nnumerical simulation study.",

    "abstract": "Supervised person re-identification methods rely heavily on high-quality\ncross-camera training label. This significantly hinders the deployment of re-ID\nmodels in real-world applications. The unsupervised person re-ID methods can\nreduce the cost of data annotation, but their performance is still far lower\nthan the supervised ones. In this paper, we make full use of the auxiliary\ninformation mined from the datasets for multi-modal feature learning, including\ncamera information, temporal information and spatial information. By analyzing\nthe style bias of cameras, the characteristics of pedestrians' motion\ntrajectories and the positions of camera network, this paper designs three\nmodules: Time-Overlapping Constraint (TOC), Spatio-Temporal Similarity (STS)\nand Same-Camera Penalty (SCP) to exploit the auxiliary information. Auxiliary\ninformation can improve the model performance and inference accuracy by\nconstructing association constraints or fusing with visual features. In\naddition, this paper proposes three effective training tricks, including\nRestricted Label Smoothing Cross Entropy Loss (RLSCE), Weight Adaptive Triplet\nLoss (WATL) and Dynamic Training Iterations (DTI). The tricks achieve mAP of\n72.4% and 81.1% on MARS and DukeMTMC-VideoReID, respectively. Combined with\nauxiliary information exploiting modules, our methods achieve mAP of 89.9% on\nDukeMTMC, where TOC, STS and SCP all contributed considerable performance\nimprovements.

    "abstract": "A recent line of works, initiated by \\cite{russo2016controlling} and\n\\cite{xu2017information}, has shown that the generalization error of a learning\nalgorithm can be upper bounded by information measures. In most of the relevant\nworks, the convergence rate of the expected generalization error is in the form\nof O(\\sqrt{\\lambda/{n}}) where \\lambda is some information-theoretic quantities\nsuch as the mutual information between the data sample and the learned\nhypothesis. However, such a learning rate is typically considered to be \"slow\",\ncompared to a \"fast rate\" of O(1/n) in many learning scenarios. In this work,\nwe first show that the square root does not necessarily imply a slow rate, and\na fast rate (O(1/n)) result can still be obtained using this bound under\nappropriate assumptions. Furthermore, we identify the key conditions needed for\nthe fast rate generalization error, which we call the (\\eta,c)-central\ncondition. Under this condition, we give information-theoretic bounds on the\ngeneralization error and excess risk, with a convergence rate of O(\\lambda/{n})\nfor specific learning algorithms such as empirical risk minimization.

    "abstract": "In stereoscope-based Minimally Invasive Surgeries (MIS), dense stereo\nmatching plays an indispensable role in 3D shape recovery, AR, VR, and\nnavigation tasks. Although numerous Deep Neural Network (DNN) approaches are\nproposed, the conventional prior-free approaches are still popular in the\nindustry because of the lack of open-source annotated data set and the\nlimitation of the task-specific pre-trained DNNs. Among the prior-free stereo\nmatching algorithms, there is no successful real-time algorithm in none GPU\nenvironment for MIS. This paper proposes the first CPU-level real-time\nprior-free stereo matching algorithm for general MIS tasks. We achieve an\naverage 17 Hz on 640*480 images with a single-core CPU (i5-9400) for surgical\nimages. Meanwhile, it achieves slightly better accuracy than the popular ELAS.\nThe patch-based fast disparity searching algorithm is adopted for the rectified\nstereo images. A coarse-to-fine Bayesian probability and a spatial Gaussian\nmixed model were proposed to evaluate the patch probability at different\nscales. An optional probability density function estimation algorithm was\nadopted to quantify the prediction variance. Extensive experiments demonstrated\nthe proposed method's capability to handle ambiguities introduced by the\ntextureless surfaces and the photometric inconsistency from the non-Lambertian\nreflectance and dark illumination. The estimated probability managed to balance\nthe confidences of the patches for stereo images at different scales. It has\nsimilar or higher accuracy and fewer outliers than the baseline ELAS in MIS,\nwhile it is 4-5 times faster.

    "abstract": "CNNs exhibit many behaviors different from humans, one of which is the\ncapability of employing high-frequency components. This paper discusses the\nfrequency bias phenomenon in image classification tasks: the high-frequency\ncomponents are actually much less exploited than the low- and mid-frequency\ncomponents. We first investigate the frequency bias phenomenon by presenting\ntwo observations on feature discrimination and learning priority. Furthermore,\nwe hypothesize that (i) the spectral density, (ii) class consistency directly\naffect the frequency bias. Specifically, our investigations verify that the\nspectral density of datasets mainly affects the learning priority, while the\nclass consistency mainly affects the feature discrimination.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale replicated data type stores often resort to eventual consistency\nto guarantee low latency and high availability. It is widely accepted that\nprogramming over eventually consistent data stores is challenging, since\narbitrary divergence among replicas is allowed. Moreover, pragmatic protocols\nactually achieve consistency guarantees stronger than eventual consistency,\nwhich can be and need to be utilized to facilitate the reasoning of and\nprogramming over replicated data types. Toward the challenges above, we propose\nthe ViSearch framework for precise measurement of eventual consistency\nsemantics. ViSearch employs the visibility-arbitration specification\nmethodology in concurrent programming, which extends the linearizability-based\nspecification methodology with a dynamic visibility relation among operations,\nin addition to the standard dynamic happen-before and linearization relations.\nThe consistency measurement using ViSearch is NP-hard in general. To enable\npractical and efficient consistency measurement in replicated data type stores,\nthe ViSearch framework refactors the existing brute-force checking algorithm to\na generic algorithm skeleton, which further enables efficient pruning of the\nsearch space and effective parallelization. We employ the ViSearch framework\nfor consistency measurement in two replicated data type stores Riak and\nCRDT-Redis. The experimental evaluation shows the usefulness and\ncost-effectiveness of consistency measurement based on the ViSearch framework\nin realistic scenarios.",

Through low-dimensional/analytical examples, we show that a key effect\nof the archive is that it counterbalances the exploration biases that result,\namong other factors, from the use of inadequate behavior metrics and the\nnon-linearities of the behavior mapping.

Given a subset of\nsecret events in a given system, concealability holds if the occurrence of all\nsecret events remains hidden to a curious observer (an eavesdropper).

When concealability of a system does not hold (i.e.,\none or more secret events are unconcealable), we analyze how a defender, placed\nat the interface of the system with the eavesdropper, can be used to enforce\nconcealability. The defender takes as input each observed event of the system\nand outputs a carefully modified event sequence (seen by the eavesdropper)\nusing event deletion, insertion, or replacement. The defender is said to be\nC-enforceable if, following the occurrence of the secret events and regardless\nof subsequent activity generated by the system, it can always deploy a strategy\nto manipulate observations and conceal the events perpetually.

Making simulation realistic requires models of the human road users\nwho interact with such cars. Such models can be obtained by applying learning\nfrom demonstration (LfD) to trajectories observed by cars already on the road.\nHowever, existing LfD methods are typically insufficient, yielding policies\nthat frequently collide or drive off the road. To address this problem, we\npropose Symphony, which greatly improves realism by combining conventional\npolicies with a parallel beam search. The beam search refines these policies on\nthe fly by pruning branches that are unfavourably evaluated by a discriminator.\nHowever, it can also harm diversity, i.e., how well the agents cover the entire\ndistribution of realistic behaviour, as pruning can encourage mode collapse.\nSymphony addresses this issue with a hierarchical approach, factoring agent\nbehaviour into goal generation and goal conditioning. The use of such goals\nensures that agent diversity neither disappears during adversarial training nor\nis pruned away by the beam search.

In this work, we present a rare-event sampling approach to\nidentify LAAs that lead to critical network failure events (defined by the\nactivation of a power grid emergency response (ER)). The proposed sampler is\ndesigned to \"skip\" over LAA instances that are of little interest (i.e., those\nthat do not trigger network failure), thus significantly reducing the\ncomputational complexity in identifying the impactful LAAs. We perform\nextensive simulations of LAAs using the Kundur two-area system (KTAS) power\nnetwork while employing the rare-event sampler.

Inspired by\nrecent works on Reinforcement Learning benchmarks, we argue that the\nidentification of challenges faced by QD methods and the development of\ntargeted, challenging, scalable but affordable benchmarks is an important step.\nAs an initial effort, we identify three problems that are challenging in sparse\nreward settings, and propose associated benchmarks: (1) Behavior metric bias,\nwhich can result from the use of metrics that do not match the structure of the\nbehavior space. (2) Behavioral Plateaus, with varying characteristics, such\nthat escaping them would require adaptive QD algorithms and (3) Evolvability\nTraps, where small variations in genotype result in large behavioral changes.\nThe environments that we propose satisfy the properties listed above.",

The\npreconditioner implemented in parGeMSLR is based on algebraic domain\ndecomposition and partitions the symmetrized adjacency graph recursively into\nseveral non-overlapping partitions via a p-way vertex separator, where p is an\ninteger multiple of the total number of MPI processes. From a numerical\nperspective, parGeMSLR builds a Schur complement approximate inverse\npreconditioner as the sum between the matrix inverse of the interface coupling\nmatrix and a low-rank correction term. To reduce the cost associated with the\ncomputation of the approximate inverse matrices, parGeMSLR exploits a\nmultilevel partitioning of the algebraic domain. The parGeMSLR library is\nimplemented on top of the Message Passing Interface and can solve both real and\ncomplex linear systems. Furthermore, parGeMSLR can take advantage of hybrid\ncomputing environments with in-node access to one or more Graphics Processing\nUnits.

This is realized by facilitating the IoT\nobjects to socialize with one another, i.e., similar to the social interactions\namongst the human beings. A fundamental issue that mandates careful attention\nis to thus establish, and over time, maintain trustworthy relationships amongst\nthese IoT objects. Therefore, a trust framework for SIoT must include\nobject-object interactions, the aspects of social relationships, credible\nrecommendations, etc., however, the existing literature has only focused on\nsome aspects of trust by primarily relying on the conventional approaches that\ngovern linear relationships between input and output. In this paper, an\nartificial neural network-based trust framework, Trust-SIoT, has been envisaged\nfor identifying the complex non-linear relationships between input and output\nin a bid to classify the trustworthy objects. Moreover, Trust-SIoT has been\ndesigned for capturing a number of key trust metrics as input, i.e., direct\ntrust by integrating both current and past interactions, reliability, and\nbenevolence of an object, credible recommendations, and the degree of\nrelationship by employing a knowledge graph embedding. Finally, we have\nperformed extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of Trust-SIoT\nvis-a-vis state-of-the-art heuristics on two real-world datasets.

    "abstract": "When omega-regular objectives were first proposed in model-free reinforcement\nlearning (RL) for controlling MDPs, deterministic Rabin automata were used in\nan attempt to provide a direct translation from their transitions to scalar\nvalues. While these translations failed, it has turned out that it is possible\nto repair them by using good-for-MDPs (GFM) B\\\"uchi automata instead. These are\nnondeterministic B\\\"uchi automata with a restricted type of nondeterminism,\nalbeit not as restricted as in good-for-games automata.

Interestingly, the same\ncannot be said for deterministic Streett automata: a translation to\nnondeterministic Rabin or B\\\"uchi automata comes at an exponential cost, even\nwithout requiring the target automaton to be good-for-MDPs. Do we have to pay\nmore than that to obtain a good-for-MDP automaton? The surprising answer is\nthat we have to pay significantly less when we instead expand the good-for-MDP\nproperty to alternating automata: like the nondeterministic GFM automata\nobtained from deterministic Rabin automata, the alternating good-for-MDP\nautomata we produce from deterministic Streett automata are bi-linear in the\nthe size of the deterministic automaton and its index, and can therefore be\nexponentially more succinct than minimal nondeterministic B\\\"uchi automata.",

    "title": "Post Approvals in Online Communities",
    "abstract": "In many online communities, community leaders (i.e., moderators and\nadministrators) can proactively filter undesired content by requiring posts to\nbe approved before publication. But although many communities adopt post\napprovals, there has been little research on its impact on community behavior.\nThrough a longitudinal analysis of 233,402 Facebook Groups, we examined 1) the\nfactors that led to a community adopting post approvals and 2) how the setting\nshaped subsequent user activity and moderation in the group. We find that\ncommunities that adopted post approvals tended to do so following sudden\nincreases in user activity (e.g., comments) and moderation (e.g., reported\nposts). This adoption of post approvals led to fewer but higher-quality posts.\nThough fewer posts were shared after adoption, not only did community members\nwrite more comments, use more reactions, and spend more time on the posts that\nwere shared, they also reported these posts less. Further, post approvals did\nnot significantly increase the average time leaders spent in the group, though\ngroups that enabled the setting tended to appoint more leaders. Last, the\nimpact of post approvals varied with both group size and how the setting was\nused, e.g.,, group size mediates whether leaders spent more or less time in the\ngroup following the adoption of the setting. Our findings suggest ways that\nproactive content moderation may be improved to better support online\ncommunities.",

    "abstract": "In India, post the demonetization exercise in 2016, digital payments have\nbecome extremely popular. Among them, the volume of transactions using Paytm\nwallets and UPI (Unified Payment Interface) have grown manifold. The lockdowns\ndue to COVID-19 Pandemic have furthered this trend. Side by side,\ncrypto-currencies such as bitcoin are also gaining traction. Many countries are\nconsidering issuing a Digital Currency via their Central Banks. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Decentralized Digital Currency System (DDCS) that makes use\nof Merkle Hash-Trees as Authenticated Data Structures. DDCS uses a Ledger-less,\ndistributed, peer-to-peer architecture. We name the proposed currency\n$\\delta$-Money. $\\delta$-Money is intended as a replacement for physical\ncurrency and has in-built security features that rival crypto-currencies.\nTransactions using $\\delta$-Money happen in a disintermediated manner but with\npost-facto reconciliation. In place of Central Bank-issued Digital Currency\n(CBDC), we envisage a scenario where multiple Payment Banks issue digital\ncurrencies that have stable valuations without being subject to either\nvolatility or perennial devaluation.",

    "abstract": "Development and optimization of biopharmaceutical production processes with\ncell cultures is cost- and time-consuming and often performed rather\nempirically. Efficient optimization of multiple-objectives like process time,\nviable cell density, number of operating steps & cultivation scales, required\nmedium, amount of product as well as product quality depicts a promising\napproach. This contribution presents a workflow which couples uncertainty-based\nupstream simulation and Bayes optimization using Gaussian processes. Its\napplication is demonstrated in a simulation case study for a relevant\nindustrial task in process development, the design of a robust cell culture\nexpansion process (seed train), meaning that despite uncertainties and\nvariabilities concerning cell growth, low variations of viable cell density\nduring the seed train are obtained. Compared to a non-optimized reference seed\ntrain, the optimized process showed much lower deviation rates regarding viable\ncell densities (<~10% instead of 41.7%) using 5 or 4 shake flask scales and\nseed train duration could be reduced by 56 h from 576 h to 520 h. Overall, it\nis shown that applying Bayes optimization allows for optimization of a\nmulti-objective optimization function with several optimizable input variables\nand under a considerable amount of constraints with a low computational effort.\nThis approach provides the potential to be used in form of a decision tool,\ne.g. for the choice of an optimal and robust seed train design or for further\noptimization tasks within process development.",

    "abstract": "Programming embedded systems applications involve writing concurrent,\nevent-driven and timing-aware programs. Traditionally, such programs are\nwritten in low-level machine-oriented programming languages like C or Assembly.\nWe present an alternative by introducing Synchron, an API that offers\nhigh-level abstractions to the programmer while supporting the low-level\ninfrastructure in an associated runtime system and one-time-effort drivers.\nEmbedded systems applications exhibit the general characteristics of being (i)\nconcurrent, (ii) I/O-bound and (iii) timing-aware. To address each of these\nconcerns, the Synchron API consists of three components: (1) a Concurrent ML\n(CML) inspired message-passing concurrency model, (2) a message-passing--based\nI/O interface that translates between low-level interrupt based and\nmemory-mapped peripherals, and (3) a timing operator, $syncT$, that marries\nCML's $sync$ operator with timing windows inspired from the TinyTimber kernel.\nWe implement the Synchron API as the bytecode instructions of a virtual machine\ncalled SynchronVM. SynchronVM hosts a Caml-inspired functional language as its\nfrontend language, and the backend of the VM supports the STM32F4 and NRF52\nmicrocontrollers, with RAM in the order of hundreds of kilobytes. We illustrate\nthe expressiveness of the Synchron API by showing examples of expressing state\nmachines commonly found in embedded systems. The timing functionality is\ndemonstrated through a music programming exercise. Finally, we provide\nbenchmarks on the response time, jitter rates, memory, and power usage of the\nSynchronVM.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and reliable sensor calibration is essential to fuse LiDAR and\ninertial measurements, which are usually available in robotic applications. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel LiDAR-IMU calibration method within the\ncontinuous-time batch-optimization framework, where the intrinsics of both\nsensors and the spatial-temporal extrinsics between sensors are calibrated\nwithout using calibration infrastructure such as fiducial tags. Compared to\ndiscrete-time approaches, the continuous-time formulation has natural\nadvantages for fusing high rate measurements from LiDAR and IMU sensors. To\nimprove efficiency and address degenerate motions, two observability-aware\nmodules are leveraged: (i) The information-theoretic data selection policy\nselects only the most informative segments for calibration during data\ncollection, which significantly improves the calibration efficiency by\nprocessing only the selected informative segments. (ii) The observability-aware\nstate update mechanism in nonlinear least-squares optimization updates only the\nidentifiable directions in the state space with truncated singular value\ndecomposition (TSVD), which enables accurate calibration results even under\ndegenerate cases where informative data segments are not available. The\nproposed LiDAR-IMU calibration approach has been validated extensively in both\nsimulated and real-world experiments with different robot platforms,\ndemonstrating its high accuracy and repeatability in commonly-seen human-made\nenvironments.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of mobile Internet and big data, a huge amount of\ndata is generated in the network, but the data that users are really interested\nin a very small portion. To extract the information that users are interested\nin from the huge amount of data, the information overload problem needs to be\nsolved. In the era of mobile internet, the user's characteristics and other\ninformation should be combined in the massive amount of data to quickly and\naccurately recommend content to the user, as far as possible to meet the user's\npersonalized needs. Therefore, there is an urgent need to realize high-speed\nand effective retrieval in tens of thousands of micro-videos. Video data\ncontent contains complex meanings, and there are intrinsic connections between\nvideo data. For multimodal information, subspace coding learning is introduced\nto build a coding network from public potential representations to multimodal\nfeature information, taking into account the consistency and complementarity of\ninformation under each modality to obtain a public representation of the\ncomplete eigenvalue. An end-to-end reordering model based on deep learning and\nattention mechanism, called interest-related product similarity model based on\nmultimodal data, is proposed for providing top-N recommendations. The\nmultimodal feature learning module, interest-related network module and product\nsimilarity recommendation module together form the new model.By conducting\nextensive experiments on publicly accessible datasets, the results demonstrate\nthe state-of-the-art performance of our proposed algorithm and its\neffectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Crowd Counting has important applications in public safety and pandemic\ncontrol. A robust and practical crowd counting system has to be capable of\ncontinuously learning with the new-coming domain data in real-world scenarios\ninstead of fitting one domain only. Off-the-shelf methods have some drawbacks\nto handle multiple domains. 1) The models will achieve limited performance\n(even drop dramatically) among old domains after training images from new\ndomains due to the discrepancies of intrinsic data distributions from various\ndomains, which is called catastrophic forgetting. 2) The well-trained model in\na specific domain achieves imperfect performance among other unseen domains\nbecause of the domain shift. 3) It leads to linearly-increased storage overhead\neither mixing all the data for training or simply training dozens of separate\nmodels for different domains when new ones are available. To overcome these\nissues, we investigate a new task of crowd counting under the incremental\ndomains training setting, namely, Lifelong Crowd Counting. It aims at\nalleviating the catastrophic forgetting and improving the generalization\nability using a single model updated by the incremental domains. To be more\nspecific, we propose a self-distillation learning framework as a\nbenchmark~(Forget Less, Count Better, FLCB) for lifelong crowd counting, which\nhelps the model sustainably leverage previous meaningful knowledge for better\ncrowd counting to mitigate the forgetting when the new data arrive. Meanwhile,\na new quantitative metric, normalized backward transfer~(nBwT), is developed to\nevaluate the forgetting degree of the model in the lifelong learning process.\nExtensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed\nbenchmark in achieving a low catastrophic forgetting degree and strong\ngeneralization ability.",

For realistic\napplications, these ML models consider the component-level characteristics that\ninfluence the network response during emergencies. However, such an approach\ncould result in a large number of features and cause ML models to suffer from\nthe `curse of dimensionality'. We present a clustering-based method that\nsimultaneously minimizes the problem of high-dimensionality and improves the\nprediction accuracy of ML models developed for resilience analysis in\nlarge-scale interdependent infrastructure networks. The methodology has three\nparts: (a) generation of simulation dataset, (b) network component clustering,\nand (c) dimensionality reduction and development of prediction models. First,\nan interdependent infrastructure simulation model simulates the network-wide\nconsequences of various disruptive events. The component-level features are\nextracted from the simulated data. Next, clustering algorithms are used to\nderive the cluster-level features by grouping component-level features based on\ntheir topological and functional characteristics. Finally, ML algorithms are\nused to develop models that predict the network-wide impacts of disruptive\nevents using the cluster-level features. The applicability of the method is\ndemonstrated using an interdependent power-water-transport testbed.

While\ndrawing motivation from recent graph learning methods that learn to solve\ncombinatorial optimization (CO) problems such as multi-Traveling Salesman and\nVehicle Routing Problems using RL, this paper seeks to provide better\nperformance (compared to non-learning methods) and important scalability\n(compared to existing learning architectures) for the stated class of MRTA\nproblems. The proposed neural architecture, called Capsule Attention-based\nMechanism or CapAM acts as the policy network, and includes three main\ncomponents: 1) an encoder: a Capsule Network based node embedding model to\nrepresent each task as a learnable feature vector; 2) a decoder: an\nattention-based model to facilitate a sequential output; and 3) context: that\nencodes the states of the mission and the robots. To train the CapAM model, the\npolicy-gradient method based on REINFORCE is used. When evaluated over unseen\nscenarios, CapAM demonstrates better task completion performance and $>$10\ntimes faster decision-making compared to standard non-learning based online\nMRTA methods.

In practice, the selection of a proper location or trajectory for the\nUAV very much depends on local terrain features, including the position of\nsurrounding radio obstacles. Hence, the robot must be able to map the features\nof its radio environment as it performs its data communication or sensing\nservices. The challenges related to this task, referred here as radio mapping,\nare discussed in this paper. Its promises related to efficient trajectory\ndesign for autonomous radio-aware UAVs are highlighted, along with algorithm\nsolutions. The advantages induced by radio-mapping in terms of connectivity,\nsensing, and localization performance are illustrated.",

To enhance object detection in a\ndark environment, we propose a novel multitask auto encoding transformation\n(MAET) model which is able to explore the intrinsic pattern behind illumination\ntranslation. In a self-supervision manner, the MAET learns the intrinsic visual\nstructure by encoding and decoding the realistic illumination-degrading\ntransformation considering the physical noise model and image signal processing\n(ISP).\nBased on this representation, we achieve the object detection task by\ndecoding the bounding box coordinates and classes. To avoid the\nover-entanglement of two tasks, our MAET disentangles the object and degrading\nfeatures by imposing an orthogonal tangent regularity. This forms a parametric\nmanifold along which multitask predictions can be geometrically formulated by\nmaximizing the orthogonality between the tangents along the outputs of\nrespective tasks. Our framework can be implemented based on the mainstream\nobject detection architecture and directly trained end-to-end using normal\ntarget detection datasets, such as VOC and COCO.

However, RL typically requires a large amount of\nonline interaction with the environment. This limits its applicability to\nreal-world settings, such as in robotics, where such interaction is expensive.\nIn this work we investigate ways to minimize online interactions in a target\ntask, by reusing a suboptimal policy we might have access to, for example from\ntraining on related prior tasks, or in simulation. To this end, we develop two\nRL algorithms that can speed up training by using not only the action\ndistributions of teacher policies, but also data collected by such policies on\nthe task at hand. We conduct a thorough experimental study of how to use\nsuboptimal teachers on a challenging robotic manipulation benchmark on\nvision-based stacking with diverse objects. We compare our methods to offline,\nonline, offline-to-online, and kickstarting RL algorithms. By doing so, we find\nthat training on data from both the teacher and student, enables the best\nperformance for limited data budgets. We examine how to best allocate a limited\ndata budget -- on the target task -- between the teacher and the student\npolicy, and report experiments using varying budgets, two teachers with\ndifferent degrees of suboptimality, and five stacking tasks that require a\ndiverse set of behaviors. Our analysis, both in simulation and in the real\nworld, shows that our approach is the best across data budgets, while standard\noffline RL from teacher rollouts is surprisingly effective when enough data is\ngiven.",

    "abstract": "Aerial scene classification remains challenging as: 1) the size of key\nobjects in determining the scene scheme varies greatly; 2) many objects\nirrelevant to the scene scheme are often flooded in the image. Hence, how to\neffectively perceive the region of interests (RoIs) from a variety of sizes and\nbuild more discriminative representation from such complicated object\ndistribution is vital to understand an aerial scene. In this paper, we propose\na novel all grains, one scheme (AGOS) framework to tackle these challenges. To\nthe best of our knowledge, it is the first work to extend the classic multiple\ninstance learning into multi-grain formulation. Specially, it consists of a\nmulti-grain perception module (MGP), a multi-branch multi-instance\nrepresentation module (MBMIR) and a self-aligned semantic fusion (SSF) module.\nFirstly, our MGP preserves the differential dilated convolutional features from\nthe backbone, which magnifies the discriminative information from multi-grains.\nThen, our MBMIR highlights the key instances in the multi-grain representation\nunder the MIL formulation. Finally, our SSF allows our framework to learn the\nsame scene scheme from multi-grain instance representations and fuses them, so\nthat the entire framework is optimized as a whole. Notably, our AGOS is\nflexible and can be easily adapted to existing CNNs in a plug-and-play manner.\nExtensive experiments on UCM, AID and NWPU benchmarks demonstrate that our AGOS\nachieves a comparable performance against the state-of-the-art methods.",

During transferring, given scarce\nsamples of novel classes, the model suffers from learning discriminative\nfeatures to distinguish novel instances from backgrounds and base classes. To\novercome the obstacles, we propose a novel framework, Mining Implicit Novel\nInstances (MINI), to mine the implicit novel instances as auxiliary training\nsamples, which widely exist in abundant base data but are not annotated. MINI\ncomprises an offline mining mechanism and an online mining mechanism. The\noffline mining mechanism leverages a self-supervised discriminative model to\ncollaboratively mine implicit novel instances with a trained FSOD network.\nTaking the mined novel instances as auxiliary training samples, the online\nmining mechanism takes a teacher-student framework to simultaneously update the\nFSOD network and the mined implicit novel instances on the fly. Extensive\nexperiments on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets show MINI achieves new\nstate-of-the-art performance on any shot and split. The significant performance\nimprovements demonstrate the superiority of our method.",

    "abstract": "To foster usefulness and accountability of machine learning (ML), it is\nessential to explain a model's decisions in addition to evaluating its\nperformance. Accordingly, the field of explainable artificial intelligence\n(XAI) has resurfaced as a topic of active research, offering approaches to\naddress the \"how\" and \"why\" of automated decision-making. Within this domain,\ncounterfactual explanations (CFEs) have gained considerable traction as a\npsychologically grounded approach to generate post-hoc explanations. To do so,\nCFEs highlight what changes to a model's input would have changed its\nprediction in a particular way. However, despite the introduction of numerous\nCFE approaches, their usability has yet to be thoroughly validated at the human\nlevel. Thus, to advance the field of XAI, we introduce the Alien Zoo, an\nengaging, web-based and game-inspired experimental framework. The Alien Zoo\nprovides the means to evaluate usability of CFEs for gaining new knowledge from\nan automated system, targeting novice users in a domain-general context. As a\nproof of concept, we demonstrate the practical efficacy and feasibility of this\napproach in a user study. Our results suggest that users benefit from receiving\nCFEs compared to no explanation, both in terms of objective performance in the\nproposed iterative learning task, and subjective usability. With this work, we\naim to equip research groups and practitioners with the means to easily run\ncontrolled and well-powered user studies to complement their otherwise often\nmore technology-oriented work.

For each update, its size,\ni.e. the service time required for complete transmission to the destination, is\nalso arbitrary. At any time, age of information (AoI) is equal to the\ndifference between the current time, and the arrival time of the latest update\n(at the source) that has been completely transmitted (to the destination). AoI\nquantifies the staleness of the update (information) at the destination. The\ngoal is to find a causal scheduling policy that minimizes the time average of\nAoI, where the possible decisions at any time are i) whether to preempt the\nupdate under transmission upon arrival of a new update, and ii) if no update is\nunder transmission, then choose which update to transmit (among the available\nupdates).\nIn this paper, we propose a causal policy called SRPT$^+$ that at each time,\ni) preempts the update under transmission if a new update arrives with a\nsmaller size, and ii) if no update is under transmission, then begins to\ntransmit the update for which the ratio of the reduction in AoI upon complete\ntransmission (if not preempted in future) and the remaining size, is maximum.\nWe characterize the performance of SRPT$^+$ using the metric called the\ncompetitive ratio, i.e. the ratio of the average AoI of causal policy and the\naverage AoI of an optimal offline policy (that knows the entire input in\nadvance), maximized over all possible inputs. We show that the competitive\nratio of SRPT$^+$ is at most $4$. Further, we propose a simpler policy called\nSRPT$^L$, that i) preempts the update under transmission if a new update\narrives with a smaller size, and ii) if no update is under transmission, then\nbegins to transmit the update with the latest arrival time. We show that the\ncompetitive ratio of SRPT$^L$ is at most $29$.",

One important application is clinical\nreport generation from chest radiographs. The clinical writing of unstructured\nreports is time consuming and error-prone. An automated system would improve\nstandardization, error reduction, time consumption, and medical accessibility.\nIn this paper we demonstrate the importance of domain specific pre-training and\npropose a modified transformer architecture for the medical image captioning\ntask. To accomplish this, we train a series of modified transformers to\ngenerate clinical reports from chest radiograph image input. These modified\ntransformers include: a meshed-memory augmented transformer architecture with\nvisual extractor using ImageNet pre-trained weights, a meshed-memory augmented\ntransformer architecture with visual extractor using CheXpert pre-trained\nweights, and a meshed-memory augmented transformer whose encoder is passed the\nconcatenated embeddings using both ImageNet pre-trained weights and CheXpert\npre-trained weights.

In\nthis paper, we propose a method, named Invariant Content Synergistic Learning\n(ICSL), to improve the generalization ability of DCNNs on unseen datasets by\ncontrolling the inductive bias.

    "abstract": "Deep learning is showing an increasing number of audience in medical imaging\nresearch. In the segmentation task of medical images, we oftentimes rely on\nvolumetric data, and thus require the use of 3D architectures which are praised\nfor their ability to capture more features from the depth dimension. Yet, these\narchitectures are generally more ineffective in time and compute compared to\ntheir 2D counterpart on account of 3D convolutions, max pooling,\nup-convolutions, and other operations used in these networks.

To alleviate these issues, we propose to cast volumetric data to\n2D super images and use 2D networks for the segmentation task. The method\nprocesses the 3D image by stitching slices side-by-side to generate a super\nresolution image. While the depth information is lost, we expect that deep\nneural networks can still capture and learn these features. Our goal in this\nwork is to introduce a new perspective when dealing with volumetric data, and\ntest our hypothesis using vanilla networks.

As\ntime is brain, a fast, accurate and automated diagnosis of these scans is\ndesirable. Human readers compare the left and right hemispheres in their\nassessment of strokes. A large training data set is required for a standard\ndeep learning-based model to learn this strategy from data. As labeled medical\ndata in this field is rare, other approaches need to be developed. To both\ninclude the prior knowledge of side comparison and increase the amount of\ntraining data, we propose an augmentation method that generates artificial\ntraining samples by recombining vessel tree segmentations of the hemispheres or\nhemisphere subregions from different patients. The subregions cover vessels\ncommonly affected by LVOs, namely the internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle\ncerebral artery (MCA). In line with the augmentation scheme, we use a\n3D-DenseNet fed with task-specific input, fostering a side-by-side comparison\nbetween the hemispheres. Furthermore, we propose an extension of that\narchitecture to process the individual hemisphere subregions. All\nconfigurations predict the presence of an LVO, its side, and the affected\nsubregion.

The main challenge in FMIM compared to the general case\nof CBIR, is that the subject to whom a query image belongs may be affected by\naging and progressive degenerative disorders, making it difficult to match data\non a subject level. CBIR with DNNs is generally solved by minimizing a ranking\nloss, such as Triplet loss (TL), computed on image representations extracted by\na DNN from the original data. TL, in particular, operates on triplets: anchor,\npositive (similar to anchor) and negative (dissimilar to anchor). Although TL\nhas been shown to perform well in many CBIR tasks, it still has limitations,\nwhich we identify and analyze in this work. In this paper, we introduce (i) the\nAdaTriplet loss -- an extension of TL whose gradients adapt to different\ndifficulty levels of negative samples, and (ii) the AutoMargin method -- a\ntechnique to adjust hyperparameters of margin-based losses such as TL and our\nproposed loss dynamically.

    "abstract": "The deep neural network is a research hotspot for histopathological image\nanalysis, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis for\npathologists or be used for disease screening. The whole slide pathological\nimage can reach one gigapixel and contains abundant tissue feature information,\nwhich needs to be divided into a lot of patches in the training and inference\nstages. This will lead to a long convergence time and large memory consumption.\nFurthermore, well-annotated data sets are also in short supply in the field of\ndigital pathology. Inspired by the pathologist's clinical diagnosis process, we\npropose a weakly supervised deep reinforcement learning framework, which can\ngreatly reduce the time required for network inference. We use neural network\nto construct the search model and decision model of reinforcement learning\nagent respectively. The search model predicts the next action through the image\nfeatures of different magnifications in the current field of view, and the\ndecision model is used to return the predicted probability of the current field\nof view image. In addition, an expert-guided model is constructed by\nmulti-instance learning, which not only provides rewards for search model, but\nalso guides decision model learning by the knowledge distillation method.\nExperimental results show that our proposed method can achieve fast inference\nand accurate prediction of whole slide images without any pixel-level\nannotations.",

To\naccomplish this task, we introduce an iterative approach for consistent ligand\ncharge assignment for ligands in the CSD. Across this set, we observe that MR\ncharacter correlates linearly with the inverse value of the averaged bond order\nover all bonds in the molecule. We then demonstrate that ligand additivity of\nMR character holds in TMCs, which suggests that the TMC MR character can be\ninferred from the sum of the MR character of the ligands. Encouraged by this\nobservation, we leverage ligand additivity and develop a ligand-derived machine\nlearning representation to train neural networks to predict the MR character of\nTMCs from properties of the constituent ligands.

In this paper, we explore the geometric\nproperties and develop methods for such adjoint systems. In particular, we\nutilize symplectic and presymplectic geometry to investigate the properties of\nadjoint systems associated with ordinary differential equations and\ndifferential-algebraic equations, respectively. We show that the adjoint\nvariational quadratic conservation laws, which are key to adjoint sensitivity\nanalysis, arise from (pre)symplecticity of such adjoint systems. We discuss\nvarious additional geometric properties of adjoint systems, such as symmetries\nand variational characterizations. For adjoint systems associated with a\ndifferential-algebraic equation, we relate the index of the\ndifferential-algebraic equation to the presymplectic constraint algorithm of\nGotay et al. [18]. As an application of this geometric framework, we discuss\nhow the adjoint variational quadratic conservation laws can be used to compute\nsensitivities of terminal or running cost functions. Furthermore, we develop\nstructure-preserving numerical methods for such systems using Galerkin\nHamiltonian variational integrators (Leok and Zhang [23]) which admit discrete\nanalogues of these quadratic conservation laws. We additionally show that such\nmethods are natural, in the sense that reduction, forming the adjoint system,\nand discretization all commute, for suitable choices of these processes. We\nutilize this naturality to derive a variational error analysis result for the\npresymplectic variational integrator that we use to discretize the adjoint DAE\nsystem.

Hence, this study assessed the quality of the\nDEM in variable land cover types by comparing its heights against 780 Ground\nControl Points (GCPs) in Lagos State and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of\nNigeria. The pattern of distribution of the height differences was analysed\nusing spatial autocorrelation analysis, including other accuracy metrics\nemployed. In the general accuracy assessment, the DEM yielded root mean square\nerrors of 2.33m in Lagos and 3.69m in the FCT.

Despite this, the\nSPOT DEM accuracies in the varying land cover types surpassed its stated global\naccuracy.

Interestingly, KRR does not require full knowledge of the\nlikelihood ratio apart from an upper bound on it.

We then\naddress the larger class of covariate shift problems where likelihood ratio is\npossibly unbounded yet has a finite second moment.

    "abstract": "Channel estimation is a critical task in intelligent reflecting surface\n(IRS)-assisted wireless systems due to the uncertainties imposed by environment\ndynamics and rapid changes in the IRS configuration. To deal with these\nuncertainties, deep learning (DL) approaches have been proposed. Previous works\nconsider centralized learning (CL) approach for model training, which entails\nthe collection of the whole training dataset from the users at the base station\n(BS), hence introducing huge transmission overhead for data collection. To\naddress this challenge, this paper proposes a federated learning (FL) framework\nto jointly estimate both direct and cascaded channels in IRS-assisted wireless\nsystems. We design a single convolutional neural network trained on the local\ndatasets of the users without sending them to the BS. We show that the proposed\nFL-based channel estimation approach requires approximately 60% fewer pilot\nsignals and it exhibits 12 times lower transmission overhead than CL, while\nmaintaining satisfactory performance close to CL. In addition, it provides\nlower estimation error than the state-of-the-art DL-based schemes.",

Most current works are limited to a single dataset\nwhere data patterns are similar. But EEG signals are highly non-stationary,\nresulting in model's poor generalization to new users, sessions or datasets.\nThus, designing a model that can generalize to new datasets is beneficial and\nindispensable. To mitigate distribution discrepancy across datasets, we propose\nto achieve Disentangled and Side-aware Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (DSUDA)\nfor cross-dataset tinnitus diagnosis. A disentangled auto-encoder is developed\nto decouple class-irrelevant information from the EEG signals to improve the\nclassifying ability.

We\nhypothesize that electrocardiograms contain hidden risk markers that can help\nprognosticate post-operative mortality. Methods. In a derivation cohort of\n45,969 pre-operative patients (age 59+- 19 years, 55 percent women), a deep\nlearning algorithm was developed to leverage waveform signals from\npre-operative ECGs to discriminate post-operative mortality. Model performance\nwas assessed in a holdout internal test dataset and in two external hospital\ncohorts and compared with the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) score. Results.\nIn the derivation cohort, there were 1,452 deaths. The algorithm discriminates\nmortality with an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87) surpassing the discrimination\nof the RCRI score with an AUC of 0.67 (CI 0.61-0.72) in the held out test\ncohort. Patients determined to be high risk by the deep learning model's risk\nprediction had an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 8.83 (5.57-13.20) for\npost-operative mortality as compared to an unadjusted OR of 2.08 (CI 0.77-3.50)\nfor post-operative mortality for RCRI greater than 2.

We study\nastral space, a compact extension of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to which such points at\ninfinity have been added. Astral space is constructed to be as small as\npossible while still ensuring that all linear functions can be continuously\nextended to the new space. Although astral space includes all of\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$, it is not a vector space, nor even a metric space. However, it\nis sufficiently well-structured to allow useful and meaningful extensions of\nconcepts of convexity, conjugacy, and subdifferentials. We develop these\nconcepts and analyze various properties of convex functions on astral space,\nincluding the detailed structure of their minimizers, exact characterizations\nof continuity, and convergence of descent algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Nowcasting can play a key role in giving policymakers timelier insight to\ndata published with a significant time lag, such as final GDP figures.\nCurrently, there are a plethora of methodologies and approaches for\npractitioners to choose from. However, there lacks a comprehensive comparison\nof these disparate approaches in terms of predictive performance and\ncharacteristics. This paper addresses that deficiency by examining the\nperformance of 12 different methodologies in nowcasting US quarterly GDP\ngrowth, including all the methods most commonly employed in nowcasting, as well\nas some of the most popular traditional machine learning approaches.\nPerformance was assessed on three different tumultuous periods in US economic\nhistory: the early 1980s recession, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID\ncrisis. The two best performing methodologies in the analysis were long\nshort-term memory artificial neural networks (LSTM) and Bayesian vector\nautoregression (BVAR). To facilitate further application and testing of each of\nthe examined methodologies, an open-source repository containing boilerplate\ncode that can be applied to different datasets is published alongside the\npaper, available at: github.com/dhopp1/nowcasting_benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Predicting structural and energetic properties of a molecular system is one\nof the fundamental tasks in molecular simulations, and it has use cases in\nchemistry, biology, and medicine. In the past decade, the advent of machine\nlearning algorithms has impacted on molecular simulations for various tasks,\nincluding property prediction of atomistic systems. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel methodology for transferring knowledge obtained from simple molecular\nsystems to a more complex one, possessing a significantly larger number of\natoms and degrees of freedom. In particular, we focus on the classification of\nhigh and low free-energy states. Our approach relies on utilizing (i) a novel\nhypergraph representation of molecules, encoding all relevant information for\ncharacterizing the potential energy of a conformation, and (ii) novel message\npassing and pooling layers for processing and making predictions on such\nhypergraph-structured data. Despite the complexity of the problem, our results\nshow a remarkable AUC of 0.92 for transfer learning from tri-alanine to the\ndeca-alanine system. Moreover, we show that the very same transfer learning\napproach can be used to group, in an unsupervised way, various secondary\nstructures of deca-alanine in clusters having similar free-energy values. Our\nstudy represents a proof of concept that reliable transfer learning models for\nmolecular systems can be designed paving the way to unexplored routes in\nprediction of structural and energetic properties of biologically relevant\nsystems.",

However, TT factorization based\nmethods are generally not sufficient to characterize low-rankness along each\nmode of third-order tensor. Inspired by this, we generalize the tensor train\nfactorization to the mode-k tensor train factorization and introduce a\ncorresponding multi-mode tensor train (MTT) rank. Then, we proposed a novel\nlow-MTT-rank tensor completion model via multi-mode TT factorization and\nspatial-spectral smoothness regularization. To tackle the proposed model, we\ndevelop an efficient proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm.\nExtensive numerical experiment results on visual data demonstrate that the\nproposed MTTD3R method outperforms compared methods in terms of visual and\nquantitative measures.",

    "abstract": "Many real-world optimisation problems involve multiple objectives. When\nconsidered concurrently, they give rise to a set of optimal trade-off\nsolutions, also known as efficient solutions. These solutions have the property\nthat neither objective can be improved without deteriorating another objective.\nMotivated by the success of matheuristics in the single-objective domain, we\npropose a linear programming-based matheuristic for tri-objective binary\ninteger programming. To achieve a high-quality approximation of the optimal set\nof trade-off solutions, a lower bound set is first obtained using the vector\nlinear programming solver Bensolve. Then, feasibility pump-based ideas in\ncombination with path relinking are applied in novel ways so as to obtain a\nhigh quality upper bound set. Our matheuristic is compared to a\nrecently-suggested algorithm that is, to the best of our knowledge, the only\nexisting matheuristic method for tri-objective integer programming. In an\nextensive computational study, we show that our method generates a better\napproximation of the true Pareto front than the benchmark method on a large set\nof tri-objective benchmark instances. Since the developed approach starts from\na potentially fractional lower bound set, it may also be used as a primal\nheuristic in the context of linear relaxation-based multi-objective\nbranch-and-bound algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Active learning comprises many varied techniques that engage students\nactively in the construction of their understanding. Because of this variation,\ndifferent active learning techniques may be best suited to achieving different\nlearning objectives. We study students' perceptions of a set of active learning\ntechniques (including a Python simulation and an interactive game) and some\ntraditional techniques (like lecture). We find that students felt they engaged\nfairly actively with all of the techniques, though more with those with a heavy\ngrade weight and some of the active learning techniques, and they reported\nenjoying the active learning techniques the most except for an assignment that\nrequired soliciting peer advice on a research idea. All of the techniques were\nrated as relatively effective for achieving each of six learning objectives,\nbut to varying extents. The most traditional techniques like exams were rated\nhighest for achieving an objective associated with lower order cognitive\nskills, remembering concepts. In contrast, some active learning techniques like\nclass presentations and the Python simulation were rated highest for achieving\nobjectives related to higher order cognitive skills, including learning to\nconduct research, though lectures also performed surprisingly well for these\nobjectives. Other technique-objective matches are intuitive; for example, the\ndebate is rated highly for understanding pros and cons of an issue, and small\ngroup discussion is rated highly for collaborative learning. Our results\nsupport the idea that different teaching techniques are best suited for\ndifferent outcomes, which implies that a mix of techniques may be optimal in\ncourse design.",
