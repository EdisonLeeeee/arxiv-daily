    "abstract": "Using pole and plane objects in lidar SLAM can increase accuracy and decrease\nmap storage requirements compared to commonly-used point cloud maps. However,\nplace recognition and geometric verification using these landmarks is\nchallenging due to the requirement for global matching without an initial\nguess. Existing works typically only leverage either pole or plane landmarks,\nlimiting application to a restricted set of environments. We present a global\ndata association method for loop closure in lidar scans using 3D line and plane\nobjects simultaneously and in a unified manner. The main novelty of this paper\nis in the representation of line and plane objects extracted from lidar scans\non the manifold of affine subspaces, known as the affine Grassmannian. Line and\nplane correspondences are matched using our graph-based data association\nframework and subsequently registered in the least-squares sense. Compared to\npole-only approaches and plane-only approaches, our 3D affine Grassmannian\nmethod yields a 71% and 325% increase respectively to loop closure recall at\n100% precision on the KITTI dataset and can provide frame alignment with less\nthan 10 cm and 1 deg of error.",

    "abstract": "Building Information Modeling (BIM) produces three-dimensional models of\nbuildings combining the geometrical information with a wide range of\nproperties. BIM is slowly but inevitably revolutionizing the architecture,\nengineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Buildings need to be compliant\nwith regulations about stability, safety, and environmental impact. Manual\ncompliance checking is tedious and error-prone, and amending flaws discovered\nonly at construction time causes huge additional costs and delays. Several\ntools can check BIM models for conformance with rules/guidelines. For example,\nSingapore's CORENET e-Submission System checks fire safety. But since the\ncurrent BIM exchange format only contains basic information of building\nobjects, a separate, ad-hoc model pre-processing is required to determine,\ne.g., evacuation routes. Moreover, they face difficulties in adapting existing\nbuilt-in rules and/or adding new ones (to cater for building regulations, that\ncan vary not only among countries but also among parts of the same city), if at\nall possible. We propose the use of logic-based executable formalisms (CLP and\nConstraint ASP) to couple BIM models with advanced knowledge representation and\nreasoning capabilities. Previous experience shows that such formalisms can be\nused to uniformly capture and reason with knowledge (including ambiguity) in a\nlarge variety of domains. Additionally, incorporating checking within design\ntools makes it possible to ensure that models are rule-compliant at every step.\nThis also prevents erroneous designs from having to be (partially) redone,\nwhich is also costly and burdensome. To validate our proposal, we implemented a\npreliminary reasoner under CLP(Q/R) and ASP with constraints and evaluated it\nwith several BIM models.

    "abstract": "The curation of large-scale medical datasets from multiple institutions\nnecessary for training deep learning models is challenged by the difficulty in\nsharing patient data with privacy-preserving. Federated learning (FL), a\nparadigm that enables privacy-protected collaborative learning among different\ninstitutions, is a promising solution to this challenge. However, FL generally\nsuffers from performance deterioration due to heterogeneous data distributions\nacross institutions and the lack of quality labeled data. In this paper, we\npresent a robust and label-efficient self-supervised FL framework for medical\nimage analysis. Specifically, we introduce a novel distributed self-supervised\npre-training paradigm into the existing FL pipeline (i.e., pre-training the\nmodels directly on the decentralized target task datasets). Built upon the\nrecent success of Vision Transformers, we employ masked image encoding tasks\nfor self-supervised pre-training, to facilitate more effective knowledge\ntransfer to downstream federated models. Extensive empirical results on\nsimulated and real-world medical imaging federated datasets show that\nself-supervised pre-training largely benefits the robustness of federated\nmodels against various degrees of data heterogeneity. Notably, under severe\ndata heterogeneity, our method, without relying on any additional pre-training\ndata, achieves an improvement of 5.06%, 1.53% and 4.58% in test accuracy on\nretinal, dermatology and chest X-ray classification compared with the\nsupervised baseline with ImageNet pre-training. Moreover, we show that our\nself-supervised FL algorithm generalizes well to out-of-distribution data and\nlearns federated models more effectively in limited label scenarios, surpassing\nthe supervised baseline by 10.36% and the semi-supervised FL method by 8.3% in\ntest accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Symbolic Music Generation relies on the contextual representation\ncapabilities of the generative model, where the most prevalent approach is the\nTransformer-based model. Not only that, the learning of long-term context is\nalso related to the dynamic segmentation of musical structures, i.e. intro,\nverse and chorus, which is currently overlooked by the research community. In\nthis paper, we propose a multi-scale Transformer, which uses coarse-decoder and\nfine-decoders to model the contexts at the global and section-level,\nrespectively. Concretely, we designed a Fragment Scope Localization layer to\nsyncopate the music into sections, which were later used to pre-train\nfine-decoders. After that, we designed a Music Style Normalization layer to\ntransfer the style information from the original sections to the generated\nsections to achieve consistency in music style. The generated sections are\ncombined in the aggregation layer and fine-tuned by the coarse decoder. Our\nmodel is evaluated on two open MIDI datasets, and experiments show that our\nmodel outperforms the best contemporary symbolic music generative models. More\nexcitingly, visual evaluation shows that our model is superior in melody reuse,\nresulting in more realistic music.",

Our method leverages the contextual and the\nstructural information available from the code snippet by treating each snippet\nas a two-dimensional image, which naturally encodes the context and retains the\nunderlying structural information through an explicit spatial representation.\nTo codify snippets as images, we propose an ASCII codepoint-based image\nrepresentation that facilitates fast generation of sourcecode images and\neliminates redundancy in the encoding that would arise from an RGB pixel\nrepresentation. Furthermore, as sourcecode is treated as images, neither\nlexical analysis (tokenisation) nor syntax tree parsing is required, which\nmakes the proposed method agnostic to any particular programming language and\nlightweight from the application pipeline point of view. CV4Code can even\nfeaturise syntactically incorrect code which is not possible from methods that\ndepend on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nCV4Code by learning Convolutional and Transformer networks to predict the\nfunctional task, i.e. the problem it solves, of the source code directly from\nits two-dimensional representation, and using an embedding from its latent\nspace to derive a similarity score of two code snippets in a retrieval setup.\nExperimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in comparison to other methods with the same task and data\nconfigurations.

    "abstract": "With its growing use in safety/security-critical applications, Deep Learning\n(DL) has raised increasing concerns regarding its dependability. In particular,\nDL has a notorious problem of lacking robustness. Despite recent efforts made\nin detecting Adversarial Examples (AEs) via state-of-the-art attacking and\ntesting methods, they are normally input distribution agnostic and/or disregard\nthe perception quality of AEs. Consequently, the detected AEs are irrelevant\ninputs in the application context or unnatural/unrealistic that can be easily\nnoticed by humans. This may lead to a limited effect on improving the DL\nmodel's dependability, as the testing budget is likely to be wasted on\ndetecting AEs that are encountered very rarely in its real-life operations. In\nthis paper, we propose a new robustness testing approach for detecting AEs that\nconsiders both the input distribution and the perceptual quality of inputs. The\ntwo considerations are encoded by a novel hierarchical mechanism. First, at the\nfeature level, the input data distribution is extracted and approximated by\ndata compression techniques and probability density estimators. Such quantified\nfeature level distribution, together with indicators that are highly correlated\nwith local robustness, are considered in selecting test seeds. Given a test\nseed, we then develop a two-step genetic algorithm for local test case\ngeneration at the pixel level, in which two fitness functions work\nalternatively to control the quality of detected AEs. Finally, extensive\nexperiments confirm that our holistic approach considering hierarchical\ndistributions at feature and pixel levels is superior to state-of-the-arts that\neither disregard any input distribution or only consider a single\n(non-hierarchical) distribution, in terms of not only the quality of detected\nAEs but also improving the overall robustness of the DL model under testing.",

This model is able to train on only one language pair and\ntransfers, in a cross-lingual fashion, to low-resource language pairs with\nnegligible degradation in performance. When trained with all language pairs of\na large-scale parallel multilingual corpus (OPUS-100), this model achieves the\nstate-of-the-art result on the Tateoba dataset, outperforming an equally-sized\nprevious model by 8.0 points in accuracy while using less than 0.6% of their\nparallel data.

Furthermore, with the same setup, scaling up the\nnumber of rich-resource language pairs monotonically improves the performance,\nreaching a minimum of 0.4 points discrepancy in accuracy, making it less\nmandatory to collect any low-resource parallel data.

While doing so, we built a dataset\nof simulated electron affinity and ionization potential values for >40k\npolymers with varying monomer composition, stoichiometry, and chain\narchitecture, which may be used in the development of other tailored machine\nlearning approaches.

Moreover, a lack of techniques to handle the complexities of\nmorphologically rich languages has compounded the unequal development of\ntranslation models, with many widely spoken African languages being left\nbehind. This study explores the potential benefits of transfer learning in an\nEnglish-isiZulu translation framework. The results indicate the value of\ntransfer learning from closely related languages to enhance the performance of\nlow-resource translation models, thus providing a key strategy for low-resource\ntranslation going forward. We gathered results from 8 different language\ncorpora, including one multi-lingual corpus, and saw that isiXhosa-isiZulu\noutperformed all languages, with a BLEU score of 8.56 on the test set which was\nbetter from the multi-lingual corpora pre-trained model by 2.73.

It is known that Boolean MPE can be\nsolved via reduction to (weighted partial) MaxSAT.

A project-join tree is an execution plan that\nspecifies how to conjoin clauses and project out variables.

By using algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) to represent pseudo-Boolean\n(PB) functions, DPO is able to handle disjunctive clauses as well as XOR\nclauses.

The small cell-based\nnetwork architecture and device-to-device (D2D) communication are already being\nconsidered part of 5G networks and beyond. In such environments, network coding\n(NC) can be employed to achieve both higher throughput and energy efficiency.\nHowever, NC-enabled systems need to address security challenges specific to NC,\nsuch as pollution attacks.

The performance\nanalysis of the protocol during handover scenarios indicates its suitability\nfor ensuring high level of security against pollution attacks in dense small\ncell environments with multiple adversaries being present.

Typical artificial\nsystems are not equipped with comparable regulatory features. Here, we\nintroduce an artificial neural network that incorporates homeostatic features.\nIts own computing substrate is placed in a needful and vulnerable relation to\nthe very objects over which it computes. For example, artificial neurons\nperforming classification of MNIST digits or Fashion-MNIST articles of clothing\nmay receive excitatory or inhibitory effects, which alter their own learning\nrate as a direct result of perceiving and classifying the digits. In this\nscenario, accurate recognition is desirable to the agent itself because it\nguides decisions to regulate its vulnerable internal states and functionality.\nCounterintuitively, the addition of vulnerability to a learner does not\nnecessarily impair its performance. On the contrary, self-regulation in\nresponse to vulnerability confers benefits under certain conditions. We show\nthat homeostatic design confers increased adaptability under concept shift, in\nwhich the relationships between labels and data change over time, and that the\ngreatest advantages are obtained under the highest rates of shift. This\nnecessitates the rapid un-learning of past associations and the re-learning of\nnew ones. We also demonstrate the superior abilities of homeostatic learners in\nenvironments with dynamically changing rates of concept shift.

    "abstract": "Motivated by applications in the gig economy, we study approximation\nalgorithms for a \\emph{sequential pricing problem}. The input is a bipartite\ngraph $G=(I,J,E)$ between individuals $I$ and jobs $J$. The platform has a\nvalue of $v_j$ for matching job $j$ to an individual worker. In order to find a\nmatching, the platform can consider the edges $(i j) \\in E$ in any order and\nmake a one-time take-it-or-leave-it offer of a price $\\pi_{ij} = w$ of its\nchoosing to $i$ for completing $j$. The worker accepts the offer with a known\nprobability $ p_{ijw} $; in this case the job and the worker are irrevocably\nmatched. What is the best way to make offers to maximize revenue and/or social\nwelfare?\nThe optimal algorithm is known to be NP-hard to compute (even if there is\nonly a single job). With this in mind, we design efficient approximations to\nthe optimal policy via a new Random-Order Online Contention Resolution Scheme\n(RO-OCRS) for matching. Our main result is a 0.456-balanced RO-OCRS in\nbipartite graphs and a 0.45-balanced RO-OCRS in general graphs. These\nalgorithms improve on the recent bound of $\\frac{1}{2}(1-e^{-2})\\approx 0.432$\nof [BGMS21], and improve on the best known lower bounds for the correlation gap\nof matching, despite applying to a significantly more restrictive setting. As a\nconsequence of our OCRS results, we obtain a $0.456$-approximate algorithm for\nthe sequential pricing problem. We further extend our results to settings where\nworkers can only be contacted a limited number of times, and show how to\nachieve improved results for this problem, via improved algorithms for the\nwell-studied stochastic probing problem.",

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation has been extensively explored based on deep\nlearning, yet its accuracy and generalization ability still lag far behind the\nstereo-based methods. To tackle this, a few recent studies have proposed to\nsupervise the monocular depth estimation network by distilling disparity maps\nas proxy ground-truths. However, these studies naively distill the stereo\nknowledge without considering the comparative advantages of stereo-based and\nmonocular depth estimation methods. In this paper, we propose to selectively\ndistill the disparity maps for more reliable proxy supervision. Specifically,\nwe first design a decoder (MaskDecoder) that learns two binary masks which are\ntrained to choose optimally between the proxy disparity maps and the estimated\ndepth maps for each pixel. The learned masks are then fed to another decoder\n(DepthDecoder) to enforce the estimated depths to learn from only the masked\narea in the proxy disparity maps. Additionally, a Teacher-Student module is\ndesigned to transfer the geometric knowledge of the StereoNet to the MonoNet.\nExtensive experiments validate our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance\nfor self- and proxy-supervised monocular depth estimation on the KITTI dataset,\neven surpassing some of the semi-supervised methods.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning self supervised algorithms that can segment an image in a fixed\nnumber of hard labels such as the k-means algorithm and only relying only on\ndeep learning techniques are still lacking. Here, we introduce the k-textures\nalgorithm which provides self supervised segmentation of a 4-band image\n(RGB-NIR) for a $k$ number of classes. An example of its application on high\nresolution Planet satellite imagery is given. Our algorithm shows that discrete\nsearch is feasible using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and gradient\ndescent. The model detects $k$ hard clustering classes represented in the model\nas $k$ discrete binary masks and their associated $k$ independently generated\ntextures, that combined are a simulation of the original image. The similarity\nloss is the mean squared error between the features of the original and the\nsimulated image, both extracted from the penultimate convolutional block of\nKeras 'imagenet' pretrained VGG-16 model and a custom feature extractor made\nwith Planet data. The main advances of the k-textures model are: first, the $k$\ndiscrete binary masks are obtained inside the model using gradient descent. The\nmodel allows for the generation of discrete binary masks using a novel method\nusing a hard sigmoid activation function. Second, it provides hard clustering\nclasses -- each pixels has only one class. Finally, in comparison to k-means,\nwhere each pixel is considered independently, here, contextual information is\nalso considered and each class is not associated only to a similar values in\nthe color channels but to a texture. Our approach is designed to ease the\nproduction of training samples for satellite image segmentation. The model\ncodes and weights are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6359859",

Pulse-and-glide (PnG) strategy is an\nefficacious driving strategy to diminish fuel consumption in traditional\noil-fueled vehicles. However, current studies rarely focus on the verification\nof the energy-saving effect of PnG on an electric vehicle (EV) and embedding\nPnG in ACCS. This paper proposes a pulse-and-glide-driven adaptive cruise\ncontrol system (PGACCS) model which leverages PnG strategy as a parallel\nfunction with cruise control (CC) and verifies that PnG is an efficacious\nenergy-saving strategy on EV by optimizing the energy cost of the PnG operation\nusing Intelligent Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (IGPSO).\nThis paper builds up a simulation model of an EV with regenerative braking and\nACCS based on which the performance of PGACCS and regenerative braking is\nevaluated; the PnG energy performance is optimized and the effect of\nregenerative braking on PnG energy performance is evaluated. As a result of PnG\noptimization, the PnG operation in the PGACCS could cut down 28.3% energy cost\nof the EV compared to the CC operation in the traditional ACCS which verifies\nthat PnG is an effective energy-saving strategy for EV and PGACCS is a\npromising option for EV.",

As service development\nusing deep learning models has gradually become competitive, many developers\nhighly demand rapid hyperparameter optimization algorithms.

However, the huge time consumption of hyperparameter optimization\ndue to the high computational cost of the deep learning model itself has not\nbeen dealt with in-depth.

Inspired by the main\ngoal of neural network pruning, i.e., high computational cost reduction and\nperformance preservation, we presumed that the neural network (N_P) obtained\nthrough neural network pruning would be a good proxy model of N_B. In order to\nverify our idea, we performed extensive experiments by using CIFAR10, CFIAR100,\nand TinyImageNet datasets and three generally-used neural networks and three\nrepresentative hyperparameter optmization methods.

Passenger vehicles equipped\nwith a wide array of sensors (e.g., cameras, front-facing radars, LiDARs, and\nIMUs) capable of continuous perception of the environment are becoming\nincreasingly prevalent. These sensors provide a stream of high-dimensional,\ntemporally correlated data that is essential for reliable autonomous driving.\nAn autonomous driving system should effectively use the information collected\nfrom the various sensors in order to form an abstract description of the world\nand maintain situational awareness. Deep learning models, such as autoencoders,\ncan be used for that purpose, as they can learn compact latent representations\nfrom a stream of incoming data. However, most autoencoder models process the\ndata independently, without assuming any temporal interdependencies. Thus,\nthere is a need for deep learning models that explicitly consider the temporal\ndependence of the data in their architecture. This work proposes CARNet, a\nCombined dynAmic autoencodeR NETwork architecture that utilizes an autoencoder\ncombined with a recurrent neural network to learn the current latent\nrepresentation and, in addition, also predict future latent representations in\nthe context of autonomous driving. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed\nmodel in both imitation and reinforcement learning settings using both\nsimulated and real datasets. Our results show that the proposed model\noutperforms the baseline state-of-the-art model, while having significantly\nfewer trainable parameters.",

    "abstract": "Recent end-to-end multi-object detectors simplify the inference pipeline by\nremoving the hand-crafted process such as the duplicate bounding box removal\nusing non-maximum suppression (NMS). However, in the training, they require\nbipartite matching to calculate the loss from the output of the detector.\nContrary to the directivity of the end-to-end method, the bipartite matching\nmakes the training of the end-to-end detector complex, heuristic, and reliant.\nIn this paper, we aim to propose a method to train the end-to-end multi-object\ndetector without bipartite matching. To this end, we approach end-to-end\nmulti-object detection as a density estimation using a mixture model. Our\nproposed detector, called Sparse Mixture Density Object Detector (Sparse MDOD)\nestimates the distribution of bounding boxes using a mixture model. Sparse MDOD\nis trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood and our proposed\nregularization term, maximum component maximization (MCM) loss that prevents\nduplicated predictions. During training, no additional procedure such as\nbipartite matching is needed, and the loss is directly computed from the\nnetwork outputs. Moreover, our Sparse MDOD outperforms the existing detectors\non MS-COCO, a renowned multi-object detection benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, 3D data plays an indelible role in the computer vision field.\nHowever, extensive studies have proved that deep neural networks (DNNs) fed\nwith 3D data, such as point clouds, are susceptible to adversarial examples,\nwhich aim to misguide DNNs and might bring immeasurable losses. Currently, 3D\nadversarial point clouds are chiefly generated in three fashions, i.e., point\nshifting, point adding, and point dropping. These point manipulations would\nmodify geometrical properties and local correlations of benign point clouds\nmore or less. Motivated by this basic fact, we propose to defend such\nadversarial examples with the aid of 3D steganalysis techniques. Specifically,\nwe first introduce an adversarial attack and defense model adapted from the\ncelebrated Prisoners' Problem in steganography to help us comprehend 3D\nadversarial attack and defense more generally. Then we rethink two significant\nbut vague concepts in the field of adversarial example, namely, active defense\nand passive defense, from the perspective of steganalysis. Most importantly, we\ndesign a 3D adversarial point cloud detector through the lens of 3D\nsteganalysis. Our detector is double-blind, that is to say, it does not rely on\nthe exact knowledge of the adversarial attack means and victim models. To\nenable the detector to effectively detect malicious point clouds, we craft a\n64-D discriminant feature set, including features related to first-order and\nsecond-order local descriptions of point clouds. To our knowledge, this work is\nthe first to apply 3D steganalysis to 3D adversarial example defense. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3D adversarial point cloud\ndetector can achieve good detection performance on multiple types of 3D\nadversarial point clouds.",

In\nthis paper, we propose the generative adversarial physics-informed neural\nnetwork (GA-PINN), which integrates the generative adversarial (GA) mechanism\nwith the structure of PINNs, to improve the performance of PINNs by exploiting\nonly a small size of exact solutions to the PDEs. Inspired from the weighting\nstrategy of the Adaboost method, we then introduce a point-weighting (PW)\nmethod to improve the training efficiency of PINNs, where the weight of each\nsample point is adaptively updated at each training iteration. The numerical\nexperiments show that GA-PINNs outperform PINNs in many well-known PDEs and the\nPW method also improves the efficiency of training PINNs and GA-PINNs.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating fresh members in teams is considered a pathway to team\ncreativity. However, whether freshness improves team performance or not remains\nunclear, as well as the optimal involvement of fresh members for team\nperformance. This study uses a group of authors on the byline of a publication\nas a proxy for a scientific team. We extend an indicator, i.e., team freshness,\nto measure the extent to which a scientific team incorporates new members, by\ncalculating the fraction of new collaboration relations established within the\nteam. Based on more than 43 million scientific publications covering more than\na half-century of research from Microsoft Academic Graph, this study provides a\nholistic picture of the current development of team freshness by outlining the\ntemporal evolution of freshness, and its disciplinary distribution.\nSubsequently, using a multivariable regression approach, we examine the\nassociation between team freshness and papers'short-term and long-term\ncitations.The major findings are as follows: (1)team freshness in scientific\nteams has been increasing in the past half-century; (2)there exists an\ninverted-U-shaped association between team freshness and papers' citations in\nall the disciplines and in different periods;(3)the inverted-U-shaped\nrelationship between team freshness and papers' citations is only found in\nsmall teams, while, in large teams, team freshness is significantly positively\nrelated to papers' citations.",

    "abstract": "We present Leapfrog, a Coq-based framework for verifying equivalence of\nnetwork protocol parsers. Our approach is based on an automata model of P4\nparsers, and an algorithm for symbolically computing a compact representation\nof a bisimulation, using \"leaps.\" Proofs are powered by a certified compilation\nchain from first-order entailments to low-level bitvector verification\nconditions, which are discharged using off-the-shelf SMT solvers. As a result,\nparser equivalence proofs in Leapfrog are fully automatic and push-button.\nWe mechanically prove the core metatheory that underpins our approach,\nincluding the key transformations and several optimizations. We evaluate\nLeapfrog on a range of practical case studies, all of which require minimal\nconfiguration and no manual proof. Our largest case study uses Leapfrog to\nperform translation validation for a third-party compiler from automata to\nhardware pipelines. Overall, Leapfrog represents a step towards a world where\nall parsers for critical network infrastructure are verified. It also suggests\ndirections for follow-on efforts, such as verifying relational properties\ninvolving security.",

    "title": "Understanding Dynamic Tactile Sensing for Liquid Property Estimation",
    "abstract": "Humans perceive the world by interacting with objects, which often happens in\na dynamic way. For example, a human would shake a bottle to guess its content.\nHowever, it remains a challenge for robots to understand many dynamic signals\nduring contact well. This paper investigates dynamic tactile sensing by\ntackling the task of estimating liquid properties. We propose a new way of\nthinking about dynamic tactile sensing: by building a light-weighted\ndata-driven model based on the simplified physical principle. The liquid in a\nbottle will oscillate after a perturbation. We propose a simple\nphysics-inspired model to explain this oscillation and use a high-resolution\ntactile sensor GelSight to sense it. Specifically, the viscosity and the height\nof the liquid determine the decay rate and frequency of the oscillation. We\nthen train a Gaussian Process Regression model on a small amount of the real\ndata to estimate the liquid properties. Experiments show that our model can\nclassify three different liquids with 100% accuracy. The model can estimate\nvolume with high precision and even estimate the concentration of sugar-water\nsolution. It is data-efficient and can easily generalize to other liquids and\nbottles. Our work posed a physically-inspired understanding of the correlation\nbetween dynamic tactile signals and the dynamic performance of the liquid. Our\napproach creates a good balance between simplicity, accuracy, and generality.\nIt will help robots to better perceive liquids in different environments such\nas kitchens, food factories, and pharmaceutical factories.",

    "abstract": "Cross-domain sentiment classification (CDSC) aims to use the transferable\nsemantics learned from the source domain to predict the sentiment of reviews in\nthe unlabeled target domain. Existing studies in this task attach more\nattention to the sequence modeling of sentences while largely ignoring the rich\ndomain-invariant semantics embedded in graph structures (i.e., the\npart-of-speech tags and dependency relations). As an important aspect of\nexploring characteristics of language comprehension, adaptive graph\nrepresentations have played an essential role in recent years. To this end, in\nthe paper, we aim to explore the possibility of learning invariant semantic\nfeatures from graph-like structures in CDSC. Specifically, we present Graph\nAdaptive Semantic Transfer (GAST) model, an adaptive syntactic graph embedding\nmethod that is able to learn domain-invariant semantics from both word\nsequences and syntactic graphs. More specifically, we first raise a\nPOS-Transformer module to extract sequential semantic features from the word\nsequences as well as the part-of-speech tags. Then, we design a Hybrid Graph\nAttention (HGAT) module to generate syntax-based semantic features by\nconsidering the transferable dependency relations. Finally, we devise an\nIntegrated aDaptive Strategy (IDS) to guide the joint learning process of both\nmodules. Extensive experiments on four public datasets indicate that GAST\nachieves comparable effectiveness to a range of state-of-the-art models.",

    "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in controlled heat flux manipulation to\nincrease the efficiency of thermal apparatus. Heat manipulators control and\nmanipulate heat flow. A key to the effective performance of these heat\nmanipulators is their thermal design. Such designs can be achieved by a\nperiodic assembly of unit cells (known as metamaterials or meta-structure),\nwhose geometry and material properties can be optimized for a specific\nobjective. In this work, we focus on thermal metamaterial-based heat\nmanipulators such as thermal concentrator (which concentrates the heat flux in\na specified region of the domain). The main scope of the current work is to\noptimize the shape of the heat manipulators using Particle Swarm Optimization\n(PSO) method. The geometry is defined using NURBS basis functions due to the\nhigher smoothness and continuity and the thermal boundary value problem is\nsolved using Isogeometric Analysis (IGA). Often, nodes as design variables (as\nin Lagrange finite element method) generate the serrate shapes of boundaries\nwhich need to be smoothened later. For the NURBS-based boundary with the\ncontrol points as design variables, the required smoothness can be predefined\nthrough knot vectors and smoothening in the post-processing can be avoided. The\noptimized shape generated by PSO is compared with the other shape exploited in\nthe literature. The effects of the number of design variables, the thermal\nconductivity of the materials used, as well as some of the geometry parameters\non the optimum shapes are also demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to model users' dynamic preferences from\ntheir historical interactions. Recently, Transformer and convolution neural\nnetwork (CNNs) have shown great success in learning representations for SR.\nNevertheless, Transformer mainly focus on capturing content-based global\ninteractions, while CNNs effectively exploit local features in practical\nrecommendation scenarios. Thus, how to effectively aggregate CNNs and\nTransformer to model both local and global dependencies of historical item\nsequence still remains an open challenge and is rarely studied in SR. To this\nregard, we inject locality inductive bias into Transformer by combining its\nglobal attention mechanism with a local convolutional filter, and adaptively\ndetermine the mixing importance on a personalized basis through a module- and\nlayer-aware adaptive mixture units, named AdaMCT. Moreover, considering that\nsoftmax-based attention may encourage unimodal activation, we introduce the\nSqueeze-Excitation Attention (with sigmoid activation) into sequential\nrecommendation to capture multiple relevant items (keys) simultaneously.\nExtensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nAdaMCT significantly outperforms the previous Transformer and CNNs based models\nby an average of 18.46% and 60.85% respectively in terms of NDCG@5 and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "In existing biometric authentication methods, the user must perform an\nauthentication operation such as placing a finger in a scanner or facing a\ncamera. With ear acoustic authentication, acoustic characteristics of the ear\ncanal are used as biometric information. Therefore, a person wearing earphones\ndoes not need to perform any authentication operation. In biometric\nauthentication, it is necessary to minimize the false acceptance rate (FAR) so\nthat no unauthorized user is misidentified as an authorized user. However, if\nthe FAR is set low, it increases the false rejection rate (FRR), the rate at\nwhich authorized users are falsely recognized as unauthorized users. It has\nbeen reported that when FAR is 0.1%, the FRR in ear acoustic authentication\nreaches as much as 22%. In this study, we propose a method that reduces FRR and\nenhances authentication accuracy; it generates new ear canal acoustic\ncharacteristics called between-class (BC) features, which combine the ear canal\nacoustic characteristics of authorized and unauthorized users features. The\nproposed method uses a support vector machine to learn the BC features as the\ndata of authorized users, then generates a hyperplane in an area close to that\ndata. We hypothesize that this would decrease the possibility of misidentifying\nan unauthorized user as an authorized user and decrease the FRR when the FAR is\n0.1%. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, BC features were\napplied to ear acoustic authentication, and FAR and FRR were calculated. The\nFRR with FAR = 0.1% was 7.95% lower than with the previous method, and the\nequal error rate -- the error rate when FAR and FRR are equivalent -- decreased\nby 0.15%. These results confirmed that the proposed method can make ear\nacoustic authentication more convenient while maintaining a high level of\nsecurity.",

By continuously extracting the\ndependencies of features along the spatial and channel dimensions over a long\ndistance, VADepth network can effectively preserve important details and\nsuppress interfering features to better perceive the scene structure for more\naccurate depth estimates. In addition, we utilize geometric priors to form\nscale constraints for scale-aware model training.

    "abstract": "There exists a broad family of multiparty sessions in which the progress of\none session participant is not unconditional, but depends on the choices\nperformed by other participants. These sessions fall outside the scope of\ncurrently available session type systems that guarantee progress. In this work\nwe propose the first type system ensuring that well-typed multiparty sessions,\nincluding those exhibiting the aforementioned dependencies, fairly terminate.\nFair termination is termination under a fairness assumption that disregards\nthose interactions deemed unfair and therefore unrealistic. Fair termination,\ncombined with the usual safety properties ensured within sessions, not only is\ndesirable per se, but it entails progress and enables a compositional form of\nstatic analysis such that the well-typed composition of fairly terminating\nsessions results in a fairly terminating program.",

    "abstract": "Facial Action Unit (AU) detection is a crucial task for emotion analysis from\nfacial movements. The apparent differences of different subjects sometimes\nmislead changes brought by AUs, resulting in inaccurate results. However, most\nof the existing AU detection methods based on deep learning didn't consider the\nidentity information of different subjects. The paper proposes a\nmeta-learning-based cross-subject AU detection model to eliminate the\nidentity-caused differences. Besides, a transformer-based relation learning\nmodule is introduced to learn the latent relations of multiple AUs. To be\nspecific, our proposed work is composed of two sub-tasks. The first sub-task is\nmeta-learning-based AU local region representation learning, called MARL, which\nlearns discriminative representation of local AU regions that incorporates the\nshared information of multiple subjects and eliminates identity-caused\ndifferences. The second sub-task uses the local region representation of AU of\nthe first sub-task as input, then adds relationship learning based on the\ntransformer encoder architecture to capture AU relationships. The entire\ntraining process is cascaded. Ablation study and visualization show that our\nMARL can eliminate identity-caused differences, thus obtaining a robust and\ngeneralized AU discriminative embedding representation. Our results prove that\non the two public datasets BP4D and DISFA, our method is superior to the\nstate-of-the-art technology, and the F1 score is improved by 1.3% and 1.4%,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Context modeling and recognition represent complex tasks that allow mobile\nand ubiquitous computing applications to adapt to the user's situation. Current\nsolutions mainly focus on limited context information generally processed on\ncentralized architectures, potentially exposing users' personal data to privacy\nleakage, and missing personalization features. For these reasons on-device\ncontext modeling and recognition represent the current research trend in this\narea. Among the different information characterizing the user's context in\nmobile environments, social interactions and visited locations remarkably\ncontribute to the characterization of daily life scenarios. In this paper we\npropose a novel, unsupervised and lightweight approach to model the user's\nsocial context and her locations based on ego networks directly on the user\nmobile device. Relying on this model, the system is able to extract high-level\nand semantic-rich context features from smartphone-embedded sensors data.\nSpecifically, for the social context it exploits data related to both physical\nand cyber social interactions among users and their devices. As far as location\ncontext is concerned, we assume that it is more relevant to model the\nfamiliarity degree of a specific location for the user's context than the raw\nlocation data, both in terms of GPS coordinates and proximity devices. By using\n5 real-world datasets, we assess the structure of the social and location ego\nnetworks, we provide a semantic evaluation of the proposed models and a\ncomplexity evaluation in terms of mobile computing performance. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the relevance of the extracted features by showing the performance\nof 3 machine learning algorithms to recognize daily-life situations, obtaining\nan improvement of 3% of AUROC, 9% of Precision, and 5% in terms of Recall with\nrespect to use only features related to physical context.",

There are substantial multi-step relation paths between\nentities in KGs, indicating the semantic relations of entities.

    "abstract": "During the training of machine learning models, they may store or \"learn\"\nmore information about the training data than what is actually needed for the\nprediction or classification task. This is exploited by property inference\nattacks which aim at extracting statistical properties from the training data\nof a given model without having access to the training data itself. These\nproperties may include the quality of pictures to identify the camera model,\nthe age distribution to reveal the target audience of a product, or the\nincluded host types to refine a malware attack in computer networks. This\nattack is especially accurate when the attacker has access to all model\nparameters, i.e., in a white-box scenario. By defending against such attacks,\nmodel owners are able to ensure that their training data, associated\nproperties, and thus their intellectual property stays private, even if they\ndeliberately share their models, e.g., to train collaboratively, or if models\nare leaked. In this paper, we introduce property unlearning, an effective\ndefense mechanism against white-box property inference attacks, independent of\nthe training data type, model task, or number of properties. Property\nunlearning mitigates property inference attacks by systematically changing the\ntrained weights and biases of a target model such that an adversary cannot\nextract chosen properties. We empirically evaluate property unlearning on three\ndifferent data sets, including tabular and image data, and two types of\nartificial neural networks. Our results show that property unlearning is both\nefficient and reliable to protect machine learning models against property\ninference attacks, with a good privacy-utility trade-off.

    "abstract": "An open problem in artificial intelligence is how to learn and represent\nknowledge that is sufficient for a general agent that needs to solve multiple\ntasks in a given world. In this work we propose world value functions (WVFs),\nwhich are a type of general value function with mastery of the world - they\nrepresent not only how to solve a given task, but also how to solve any other\ngoal-reaching task. To achieve this, we equip the agent with an internal goal\nspace defined as all the world states where it experiences a terminal\ntransition - a task outcome. The agent can then modify task rewards to define\nits own reward function, which provably drives it to learn how to achieve all\nachievable internal goals, and the value of doing so in the current task. We\ndemonstrate a number of benefits of WVFs. When the agent's internal goal space\nis the entire state space, we demonstrate that the transition function can be\ninferred from the learned WVF, which allows the agent to plan using learned\nvalue functions. Additionally, we show that for tasks in the same world, a\npretrained agent that has learned any WVF can then infer the policy and value\nfunction for any new task directly from its rewards. Finally, an important\nproperty for long-lived agents is the ability to reuse existing knowledge to\nsolve new tasks. Using WVFs as the knowledge representation for learned tasks,\nwe show that an agent is able to solve their logical combination zero-shot,\nresulting in a combinatorially increasing number of skills throughout their\nlifetime.",

    "abstract": "The social media platform \"Parler\" has emerged into a prominent fringe\ncommunity where a significant part of the user base are self-reported\nsupporters of QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory alleging that a cabal of\nelites controls global politics. QAnon is considered to have had an influential\nrole in the public discourse during the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\nHowever, little is known about QAnon supporters on Parler and what sets them\naside from other users. Building up on social identity theory, we aim at\nprofiling the characteristics of QAnon supporters on Parler. We analyze a\nlarge-scale dataset with more than 600,000 profiles of English-speaking users\non Parler. Based on users' profiles, posts, and comments, we then extract a\ncomprehensive set of user features, linguistic features, network features, and\ncontent features. This allows us to perform user profiling and understand to\nwhat extent these features discriminate between QAnon and non-QAnon supporters\non Parler. Our analysis is three-fold: (1) We quantify the number of QAnon\nsupporters on Parler, finding that 34,913 users (5.5% of all users) openly\nreport to support the conspiracy. (2) We examine differences between QAnon vs.\nnon-QAnon supporters. We find that QAnon supporters differ statistically\nsignificantly from non-QAnon supporters across multiple dimensions. For\nexample, they have, on average, a larger number of followers, followees, and\nposts, and thus have a large impact on the Parler network. (3) We use machine\nlearning to identify which user characteristics discriminate QAnon from\nnon-QAnon supporters. We find that user features, linguistic features, network\nfeatures, and content features, can - to a large extent - discriminate QAnon\nvs. non-QAnon supporters on Parler. In particular, we find that user features\nare highly discriminatory, followed by content features and linguistic\nfeatures.",

For the first time, we\nshow that pixel positional information can be exploited to learn SVDE (Single\nView Depth Estimation) from videos. Our proposed moving object (MO) masks,\nwhich are induced by shifted positional information (SPI) and referred to as\n`SPIMO' masks, are very robust and consistently remove the independently moving\nobjects in the scenes, allowing for better learning of SVDE from videos.\nAdditionally, we introduce a new adaptive quantization scheme that assigns the\nbest per-pixel quantization curve for our depth discretization. Finally, we\nemploy existing boosting techniques in a new way to further self-supervise the\ndepth of the moving objects. With these features, our pipeline is robust\nagainst moving objects and generalizes well to high-resolution images, even\nwhen trained with small patches, yielding state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with\nalmost 8.5x fewer parameters than the previous works that learn from videos.

Making soft actuators act like human\nmuscles has been a sustained goal of researchers worldwide. So far, significant\nprogress has been made in flexibility, deformation amplitude, and variable\nstiffness of soft actuators. However, there are still deficiencies in output\nforce and force retention. Human muscle has ideal force performance, mainly due\nto muscle cross-bridge structures' motion. Inspired by cross-bridges, this\npaper proposes a new folding design of soft actuators driven by negative\npressure fluid. Meanwhile, we establish a theoretical model to predict such an\nactuator's output force and displacement under given pressures. Next, five\nactuators are fabricated using three different materials and evaluated on a\ntest platform. The test results reveal that one generates the maximum pull\nforce of 1125.9N and the maximum push force of 818.2N, and another's full\noutput force reaches 600 times its weight. Finally, demonstrative experiments\nare conducted extensively, including stretching, contracting, clamping,\nsingle-arm power assistance, and underwater movement.

However, the central model is\nvulnerable via a single point of failure, and in the local model, the utility\nof the data deteriorates significantly. The recently proposed shuffle model is\nan intermediate framework between the central and the local paradigms where the\nusers send their locally privatized data to a server where messages are\nshuffled, effacing the link between a privatized message and the corresponding\nuser, giving a better trade-off between privacy and utility than the local\nmodel, as its privacy gets amplified without adding more noise. In this paper,\nwe theoretically derive the strictest known bound for DP guarantee for the\nshuffle models with $k$-Randomized Response local randomizers. There on, we\nfocus on the utility of the shuffle model for histogram queries. Leveraging on\nthe matrix inversion method, which is used to approximate the original\ndistribution from the empirical one produced by the $k$-RR mechanism, we\nde-noise the histogram produced by the shuffle model to evaluate the total\nvariation distance of the resulting histogram from the true one, which we\nregard as the measure of utility of the privacy mechanism.

The development of weakly supervised\nsegmentation algorithm alleviates the problem of medical image annotation that\nit is time-consuming and labor-intensive. As a subset of weakly supervised\nlearning, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been proven to be effective in\nsegmentation. However, there is a lack of related information between instances\nin MIL, which limits the further improvement of segmentation performance. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised method for pixel-level\nsegmentation in histopathology images, which introduces Transformer into the\nMIL framework to capture global or long-range dependencies. The multi-head\nself-attention in the Transformer establishes the relationship between\ninstances, which solves the shortcoming that instances are independent of each\nother in MIL. In addition, deep supervision is introduced to overcome the\nlimitation of annotations in weakly supervised methods and make the better\nutilization of hierarchical information. The state-of-the-art results on the\ncolon cancer dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method\ncompared with other weakly supervised methods. It is worth believing that there\nis a potential of our approach for various applications in medical images.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic data generation is a fundamental task for many data management and\ndata science applications. Spatial data is of particular interest, and its\nsensitive nature often leads to privacy concerns. We introduce GeoPointGAN, a\nnovel GAN-based solution for generating synthetic spatial point datasets with\nhigh utility and strong individual level privacy guarantees. GeoPointGAN's\narchitecture includes a novel point transformation generator that learns to\nproject randomly generated point co-ordinates into meaningful synthetic\nco-ordinates that capture both microscopic (e.g., junctions, squares) and\nmacroscopic (e.g., parks, lakes) geographic features. We provide our privacy\nguarantees through label local differential privacy, which is more practical\nthan traditional local differential privacy. We seamlessly integrate this level\nof privacy into GeoPointGAN by augmenting the discriminator to the point level\nand implementing a randomized response-based mechanism that flips the labels\nassociated with the 'real' and 'fake' points used in training. Extensive\nexperiments show that GeoPointGAN significantly outperforms recent solutions,\nimproving by up to 10 times compared to the most competitive baseline. We also\nevaluate GeoPointGAN using range, hotspot, and facility location queries, which\nconfirm the practical effectiveness of GeoPointGAN for privacy-preserving\nquerying. The results illustrate that a strong level of privacy is achieved\nwith little-to-no adverse utility cost, which we explain through the\ngeneralization and regularization effects that are realized by flipping the\nlabels of the data during training.",

    "abstract": "Clinicians may rely on medical coding systems such as International\nClassification of Diseases (ICD) to identify patients with diseases from\nElectronic Health Records (EHRs). However, due to the lack of detail and\nspecificity as well as a probability of miscoding, recent studies suggest the\nICD codes often cannot characterise patients accurately for specific diseases\nin real clinical practice, and as a result, using them to find patients for\nstudies or trials can result in high failure rates and missing out on uncoded\npatients. Manual inspection of all patients at scale is not feasible as it is\nhighly costly and slow.\nThis paper proposes a scalable workflow which leverages both structured data\nand unstructured textual notes from EHRs with techniques including NLP, AutoML\nand Clinician-in-the-Loop mechanism to build machine learning classifiers to\nidentify patients at scale with given diseases, especially those who might\ncurrently be miscoded or missed by ICD codes.\nCase studies in the MIMIC-III dataset were conducted where the proposed\nworkflow demonstrates a higher classification performance in terms of F1 scores\ncompared to simply using ICD codes on gold testing subset to identify patients\nwith Ovarian Cancer (0.901 vs 0.814), Lung Cancer (0.859 vs 0.828), Cancer\nCachexia (0.862 vs 0.650), and Lupus Nephritis (0.959 vs 0.855).

    "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising technology to boost the\nefficiency of wireless energy transfer (WET) systems. However, for a multiuser\nWET system, simultaneous multi-beam energy transmission is generally required\nto achieve the maximum performance, which may not be implemented by using the\nIRS having only a single set of coefficients. As a result, it remains unknowns\nhow to exploit the IRS to approach such a performance upper bound. To answer\nthis question, we aim to maximize the total harvested energy of a multiuser WET\nsystem subject to the user fairness constraints and the non-linear energy\nharvesting model. We first consider the static IRS beamforming scheme, which\nshows that the optimal IRS reflection matrix obtained by applying semidefinite\nrelaxation is indeed of high rank in general as the number of energy receivers\n(ERs) increases, due to which the resulting rank-one solution by applying\nGaussian Randomization may lead to significant loss. To achieve the multi-beam\ngain, we then propose a general time-division based novel framework by\nexploiting the IRS's dynamic passive beamforming. Moreover, it is able to\nachieve a good balance between the system performance and complexity by\ncontrolling the number of IRS shift patterns. Finally, we also propose a\ntime-division multiple access (TDMA) based passive beamforming design for\nperformance comparison. Simulation results demonstrate the necessity of\nmulti-beam transmission and the superiority of the proposed dynamic IRS\nbeamforming scheme over existing schemes.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown the promising performance of deep learning models\n(e.g., RNN and Transformer) for long-term time series forecasting. These\nstudies mostly focus on designing deep models to effectively combine historical\ninformation for long-term forecasting. However, the question of how to\neffectively represent historical information for long-term forecasting has not\nreceived enough attention, limiting our capacity to exploit powerful deep\nlearning models. The main challenge in time series representation is how to\nhandle the dilemma between accurately preserving historical information and\nreducing the impact of noisy signals in the past. To this end, we design a\n\\textbf{F}requency \\textbf{i}mproved \\textbf{L}egendre \\textbf{M}emory model,\nor {\\bf FiLM} for short: it introduces Legendre Polynomial projections to\npreserve historical information accurately and Fourier projections plus\nlow-rank approximation to remove noisy signals.

In addition, dimensionality\nreduction introduced by low-rank approximation leads to a dramatic improvement\nin computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis of remote sensing scenes is of great significance for\nscene visualization, human-computer interaction, and various downstream\napplications. Despite the recent advances in computer graphics and\nphotogrammetry technology, generating novel views is still challenging\nparticularly for remote sensing images due to its high complexity, view\nsparsity and limited view-perspective variations. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel remote sensing view synthesis method by leveraging the recent advances in\nimplicit neural representations. Considering the overhead and far depth imaging\nof remote sensing images, we represent the 3D space by combining implicit\nmultiplane images (MPI) representation and deep neural networks. The 3D scene\nis reconstructed under a self-supervised optimization paradigm through a\ndifferentiable multiplane renderer with multi-view input constraints. Images\nfrom any novel views thus can be freely rendered on the basis of the\nreconstructed model. As a by-product, the depth maps corresponding to the given\nviewpoint can be generated along with the rendering output. We refer to our\nmethod as Implicit Multiplane Images (ImMPI). To further improve the view\nsynthesis under sparse-view inputs, we explore the learning-based\ninitialization of remote sensing 3D scenes and proposed a neural network based\nPrior extractor to accelerate the optimization process. In addition, we propose\na new dataset for remote sensing novel view synthesis with multi-view\nreal-world google earth images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the ImMPI over previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of\nreconstruction accuracy, visual fidelity, and time efficiency. Ablation\nexperiments also suggest the effectiveness of our methodology design. Our\ndataset and code can be found at https://github.com/wyc-Chang/ImMPI",

Node-level\nperformance analyses and scaling studies on up to 147k cores show that the CG\nmethod with the proposed performance optimizations is around two times faster\nthan a standard CG solver as well as optimized pipelined CG and s-step CG\nmethods for large sizes that exceed processor caches, and provides similar\nperformance near the strong scaling limit.",

In recent\nwork, biologically inspired \\textit{Hebbian} learning algorithms have shown\npromises for DNN training. In this contribution, we study the performance of\nsuch algorithms in the development of feature extractors for CBIR tasks.\nSpecifically, we consider a semi-supervised learning strategy in two steps:\nfirst, an unsupervised pre-training stage is performed using Hebbian learning\non the image dataset; second, the network is fine-tuned using supervised\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) training. For the unsupervised pre-training\nstage, we explore the nonlinear Hebbian Principal Component Analysis (HPCA)\nlearning rule. For the supervised fine-tuning stage, we assume sample\nefficiency scenarios, in which the amount of labeled samples is just a small\nfraction of the whole dataset. Our experimental analysis, conducted on the\nCIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets shows that, when few labeled samples are\navailable, our Hebbian approach provides relevant improvements compared to\nvarious alternative methods.",

Due to their high\nthroughput and finality property BFT algorithms build the core of recent\npermissioned blockchains. As a complex and resource-demanding infrastructure,\nmultiple cloud providers have started offering Blockchain-as-a-Service. This\neases the deployment of permissioned blockchains but places the cloud provider\nin a central controlling position, thereby questioning blockchains' fault\ntolerance and decentralization properties and their underlying BFT algorithm.\nThis paper presents SplitBFT, a new way to utilize trusted execution technology\n(TEEs), such as Intel SGX, to harden the safety and confidentiality guarantees\nof BFT systems thereby strengthening the trust in could-based deployments of\npermissioned blockchains. Deviating from standard assumptions, SplitBFT\nacknowledges that code protected by trusted execution may fail. We address this\nby splitting and isolating the core logic of BFT protocols into multiple\ncompartments resulting in a more resilient architecture.

This\npaper explores which textual and perceptual features human annotators perceive\nas important for the metaphoricity of discourses and expressions, and addresses\ntwo research questions more specifically. First, is a metaphorically-perceived\ndiscourse more abstract and more emotional in comparison to a\nliterally-perceived discourse? Second, is a metaphorical expression preceded by\na more metaphorical/abstract/emotional context than a synonymous literal\nalternative? We used a dataset of 1,000 corpus-extracted discourses for which\ncrowdsourced annotators (1) provided judgements on whether they perceived the\ndiscourses as more metaphorical or more literal, and (2) systematically listed\nlexical terms which triggered their decisions in (1). Our results indicate that\nmetaphorical discourses are more emotional and to a certain extent more\nabstract than literal discourses. However, neither the metaphoricity nor the\nabstractness and emotionality of the preceding discourse seem to play a role in\ntriggering the choice between synonymous metaphorical vs. literal expressions.\nOur dataset is available at\nhttps://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/discourse-met-lit.",

A substantial research effort has been\ninvested in the development of specialized algorithms for CTD tasks. From the\noperational perspective, however, the progress of ML-based CTD is hindered by\nthe difficulty in obtaining the large sets of labelled data to train ML\ndetectors. A potential solution to this problem are semisupervised learning\n(SsL) methods, which combine small labelled datasets with large amounts of\nunlabelled data.\nThis paper is aimed at systematization of existing work on SsL for CTD and,\nin particular, on understanding the utility of unlabelled data in such systems.\nTo this end, we analyze the cost of labelling in various CTD tasks and develop\na formal cost model for SsL in this context. Building on this foundation, we\nformalize a set of requirements for evaluation of SsL methods, which elucidates\nthe contribution of unlabelled data. We review the state-of-the-art and observe\nthat no previous work meets such requirements. To address this problem, we\npropose a framework for assessing the benefits of unlabelled data in SsL.

    "abstract": "Dexterous prosthetic hands have better grasp performance than traditional\nones. However, patients still find it difficult to use these hands without a\nsuitable control system. A new hybrid myoelectric control system, termed i-MYO,\nis presented and evaluated to solve this problem. The core component of the\ni-MYO is a novel grasp-type switching interface based on eye-tracking and\naugmented reality (AR), termed i-GSI. With the i-GSI, the user can easily\nswitch a grasp type (six total) for a prosthetic hand by gazing at a\nGazeButton. The i-GSI is implemented in an AR helmet and is integrated, as an\nindividual module, into the i-MYO system. In the i-MYO system, the myoelectric\nsignal was used to control hand opening /closing proportionally. The operation\nof the i-MYO was tested on nine healthy subjects who wore HIT-V hand on the\nforearm and manipulated objects in a reach-and-grasp task. It was also tested\non one patient who had an inferior myoelectric signal and was required to\ncontrol the HIT-V hand to grasp objects. Results showed that in 91.6% of the\ntrials, inexperienced healthy subjects accomplished the task within 5.9 s, and\nmost failed trials were caused by a lack of experience in fine grasping. In\naddition, in about 1.5% of trials, the subjects also successfully transferred\nthe objects but with a non-optimal grasp type. In 97.0% of the trials, the\nsubjects spent ~1.3 s switching the optimal grasp types. A higher success rate\nin grasp type (99.1%) for the untrained patient has been observed thanks to\nmore trials conducted. In 98.7 % of trials, the patient only needed another 2 s\nto control the hand to grasp the object after switching to the optimal grasp\ntype. The tests demonstrate the control capability of the new system in\nmulti-DOF prosthetics, and all inexperienced subjects were able to master the\noperation of the i-MYO quickly within a few pieces of training and apply it\neasily.",

    "abstract": "Recent engineering developments in specialised computational hardware,\ndata-acquisition and storage technology have seen the emergence of Machine\nLearning (ML) as a powerful form of data analysis with widespread applicability\nbeyond its historical roots in the design of autonomous agents. However --\npossibly because of its origins in the development of agents capable of\nself-discovery -- relatively little attention has been paid to the interaction\nbetween people and ML. In this paper we are concerned with the use of ML in\nautomated or semi-automated tools that assist one or more human decision\nmakers. We argue that requirements on both human and machine in this context\nare significantly different to the use of ML either as part of autonomous\nagents for self-discovery or as part statistical data analysis. Our principal\nposition is that the design of such human-machine systems should be driven by\nrepeated, two-way intelligibility of information rather than one-way\nexplainability of the ML-system's recommendations. Iterated rounds of\nintelligible information exchange, we think, will characterise the kinds of\ncollaboration that will be needed to understand complex phenomena for which\nneither man or machine have complete answers. We propose operational principles\n-- we call them Intelligibility Axioms -- to guide the design of a\ncollaborative decision-support system. The principles are concerned with: (a)\nwhat it means for information provided by the human to be intelligible to the\nML system; and (b) what it means for an explanation provided by an ML system to\nbe intelligible to a human. Using examples from the literature on the use of ML\nfor drug-design and in medicine, we demonstrate cases where the conditions of\nthe axioms are met. We describe some additional requirements needed for the\ndesign of a truly collaborative decision-support system.",

Unfortunately, explanation\nmethods for single decision making systems are not easily applicable to\nensembles -- i.e. they would yield an ensemble of individual explanations which\nare not necessarily consistent, hence less useful and more difficult to\nunderstand than a single consistent explanation of all observed phenomena. We\npropose a novel concept for consistently explaining an ensemble of decisions\nlocally with a single explanation -- we introduce a formal concept, as well as\na specific implementation using counterfactual explanations.",

    "abstract": "Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder find robots easier to communicate with\nthan humans. Thus, robots have been introduced in autism therapies. However,\ndue to the environmental complexity, the used robots often have to be\ncontrolled manually. This is a significant drawback of such systems and it is\nrequired to make them more autonomous. In particular, the robot should\ninterpret the child's state and continuously adapt its actions according to the\nbehaviour of the child under therapy. This survey elaborates on different forms\nof personalized robot behaviour models. Various approaches from the field of\nHuman-Robot Interaction, as well as Child-Robot Interaction, are discussed. The\naim is to compare them in terms of their deficits, feasibility in real\nscenarios, and potential usability for autism-specific Robot-Assisted Therapy.\nThe general challenge for algorithms based on which the robot learns proper\ninteraction strategies during therapeutic games is to increase the robot's\nautonomy, thereby providing a basis for a robot's decision-making.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of complex dynamic systems is a core research topic in formal\nmethods and AI, and combined modelling of systems with data has gained\nincreasing importance in applications such as business process management. In\naddition, process mining techniques are nowadays used to automatically mine\nprocess models from event data, often without correctness guarantees. Thus\nverification techniques for linear and branching time properties are needed to\nensure desired behavior. Here we consider data-aware dynamic systems with\narithmetic (DDSAs), which constitute a concise but expressive formalism of\ntransition systems with linear arithmetic guards. We present a CTL* model\nchecking procedure for DDSAs that relies on a finite-state abstraction by means\nof a set of formulas that capture variable configurations. Linear-time\nverification was shown to be decidable in specific classes of DDSAs where the\nconstraint language or the control flow are suitably confined. We investigate\nseveral of these restrictions for the case of CTL*, with both positive and\nnegative results: CTL* verification is proven decidable for monotonicity and\ninteger periodicity constraint systems, but undecidable for feedback free and\nbounded lookback systems. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we\nimplemented it in the SMT-based prototype ada, showing that many practical\nbusiness process models can be effectively analyzed.",

    "abstract": "In recommender systems, models mostly use a combination of embedding layers\nand multilayer feedforward neural networks. The high-dimensional sparse\noriginal features are downscaled in the embedding layer and then fed into the\nfully connected network to obtain prediction results. However, the above\nmethods have a rather obvious problem, that is, the features directly input are\ntreated as independent individuals, and in fact there are internal correlations\nbetween features and features, and even different features have different\nimportance in the recommendation. In this regard, this paper adopts a\nself-attentive mechanism to mine the internal correlations between features as\nwell as their relative importance. In recent years, as a special form of\nattention mechanism, self-attention mechanism is favored by many researchers.\nThe self-attentive mechanism captures the internal correlation of data or\nfeatures by learning itself, thus reducing the dependence on external sources.\nTherefore, this paper adopts a multi-headed self-attentive mechanism to mine\nthe internal correlations between features and thus learn the internal\nrepresentation of features. At the same time, considering the rich information\noften hidden between features, the new feature representation obtained by\ncrossover between the two is likely to imply the new description of the user\nlikes the item. However, not all crossover features are meaningful, i.e., there\nis a problem of limited expression of feature combinations.

    "abstract": "It is well noted that coordinate-based MLPs benefit -- in terms of preserving\nhigh-frequency information -- through the encoding of coordinate positions as\nan array of Fourier features. Hitherto, the rationale for the effectiveness of\nthese positional encodings has been mainly studied through a Fourier lens. In\nthis paper, we strive to broaden this understanding by showing that alternative\nnon-Fourier embedding functions can indeed be used for positional encoding.\nMoreover, we show that their performance is entirely determined by a trade-off\nbetween the stable rank of the embedded matrix and the distance preservation\nbetween embedded coordinates. We further establish that the now ubiquitous\nFourier feature mapping of position is a special case that fulfills these\nconditions. Consequently, we present a more general theory to analyze\npositional encoding in terms of shifted basis functions. In addition, we argue\nthat employing a more complex positional encoding -- that scales exponentially\nwith the number of modes -- requires only a linear (rather than deep)\ncoordinate function to achieve comparable performance. Counter-intuitively, we\ndemonstrate that trading positional embedding complexity for network deepness\nis orders of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art; despite the\nadditional embedding complexity. To this end, we develop the necessary\ntheoretical formulae and empirically verify that our theoretical claims hold in\npractice.",

Interesting connections between Ramsey quantifiers and two\nproblems in verification are firstly observed: (1) reachability with B\\\"{u}chi\nand generalized B\\\"{u}chi conditions in regular model checking can be seen as\nRamsey quantification over transitive automatic graphs (i.e., whose edge\nrelations are transitive), (2) checking monadic decomposability (a.k.a.\nrecognizability) of automatic relations can be viewed as Ramsey quantification\nover co-transitive automatic graphs (i.e., the complements of whose edge\nrelations are transitive). We provide a comprehensive complexity landscape of\nRamsey quantifiers in these three cases (general, transitive, co-transitive),\nall between NL and EXP. In turn, this yields a wealth of new results with\nprecise complexity, e.g., verification of subtree/flat prefix rewriting, as\nwell as monadic decomposability over tree-automatic relations. We also obtain\nsubstantially simpler proofs, e.g., for NL complexity for monadic\ndecomposability over word-automatic relations (given by DFAs).",

    "abstract": "Predictor inputs and label data for crop yield forecasting are not always\navailable at the same spatial resolution. We propose a deep learning framework\nthat uses high resolution inputs and low resolution labels to produce crop\nyield forecasts for both spatial levels. The forecasting model is calibrated by\nweak supervision from low resolution crop area and yield statistics. We\nevaluated the framework by disaggregating regional yields in Europe from parent\nstatistical regions to sub-regions for five countries (Germany, Spain, France,\nHungary, Italy) and two crops (soft wheat and potatoes). Performance of weakly\nsupervised models was compared with linear trend models and Gradient-Boosted\nDecision Trees (GBDT). Higher resolution crop yield forecasts are useful to\npolicymakers and other stakeholders. Weakly supervised deep learning methods\nprovide a way to produce such forecasts even in the absence of high resolution\nyield data.",

However, it is unavoidable to consume massive computing\npower for solving time-lock puzzles and it is difficult for encryptors to\npredict the amount of time to solve a puzzle by decryptors. In this study, an\nefficient dual-propose proof-of-work consensus allows users to release a\ntime-locked content, which is encrypted by an asymmetric key encryption scheme\non a blockchain, without trust in any third-party agents. The release time is\npredictable as the block time in a proof-of-work blockchain is adaptively\ncontrolled. The mining work is reproposed so that once a new block was mined on\nthe blockchain network, time-lock puzzles were also solved immediately. No\nadditional work is required to reveal the time-locked contents and the\nencryption is secured by monetary incentive mechanisms since it would be very\ncostly to arrange an attack attempt, which must overtake the total hash rate of\nthe whole blockchain network.",

Although recent work has shown that there can be significant\nimprovements in OOS detection when the intent classes are represented as\ndense-vectors based on domain specific knowledge, we argue in this paper that\nsuch gains are more likely due to advantages of dense-vector to one-hot\nencoding methods in representing the complexity of the OOS space. We start by\nshowing how dense-vector encodings can create OOS spaces with much richer\ntopologies than one-hot encoding methods. We then demonstrate empirically,\nusing four standard intent classification datasets, that knowledge-free,\nrandomly generated dense-vector encodings of intent classes can yield massive,\nover 20% gains over one-hot encodings, and also outperform the previous, domain\nknowledge-based, SOTA of one of the datasets.

However, from the security perspective, VLCs suffer from\nall known wireless communication security threats (e.g., eavesdropping and\nintegrity attacks). For this reason, security researchers are proposing\ninnovative Physical Layer Security (PLS) solutions to protect such\ncommunication. Among the different solutions, the novel Reflective Intelligent\nSurface (RIS) technology coupled with VLCs has been successfully demonstrated\nin recent work to improve the VLC communication capacity. However, to date, the\nliterature still lacks analysis and solutions to show the PLS capability of\nRIS-based VLC communication. In this paper, we combine watermarking and jamming\nprimitives through the Watermark Blind Physical Layer Security (WBPLSec)\nalgorithm to secure VLC communication at the physical layer. Our solution\nleverages RIS technology to improve the security properties of the\ncommunication. By using an optimization framework, we can calculate RIS phases\nto maximize the WBPLSec jamming interference schema over a predefined area in\nthe room. In particular, compared to a scenario without RIS, our solution\nimproves the performance in terms of secrecy capacity without any assumption\nabout the adversary's location. We validate through numerical evaluations the\npositive impact of RIS-aided solution to increase the secrecy capacity of the\nlegitimate jamming receiver in a VLC indoor scenario.

    "abstract": "Expectation maximisation (EM) is an unsupervised learning method for\nestimating the parameters of a finite mixture distribution. It works by\nintroducing \"hidden\" or \"latent\" variables via Baum's auxiliary function $Q$\nthat allow the joint data likelihood to be expressed as a product of simple\nfactors. The relevance of EM has increased since the introduction of the\nvariational lower bound (VLB): the VLB differs from Baum's auxiliary function\nonly by the entropy of the PDF of the latent variables $Z$. We first present a\nrederivation of the standard EM algorithm using data association ideas from the\nfield of multiple target tracking, using $K$-valued scalar data association\nhypotheses rather than the usual binary indicator vectors. The same method is\nthen applied to a little known but much more general type of supervised EM\nalgorithm for shared kernel models, related to probabilistic radial basis\nfunction networks. We address a number of shortcomings in the derivations that\nhave been published previously in this area. In particular, we give\ntheoretically rigorous derivations of (i) the complete data likelihood; (ii)\nBaum's auxiliary function (the E-step) and (iii) the maximisation (M-step) in\nthe case of Gaussian shared kernel models. The subsequent algorithm, called\nshared kernel EM (SKEM), is then applied to a digit recognition problem using a\nnovel 7-segment digit representation. Variants of the algorithm that use\ndifferent numbers of features and different EM algorithm dimensions are\ncompared in terms of mean accuracy and mean IoU. A simplified classifier is\nproposed that decomposes the joint data PDF as a product of lower order PDFs\nover non-overlapping subsets of variables.

Much like the fusion\nbetween AI and EDA, many efforts have been made to apply DNNs such as\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) to prototype and characterize next-gen\noptoelectronic devices commonly found in photonic integrated circuits (PIC) and\nLiDAR. These prior works generally strive to predict the quality factor (Q) and\nmodal volume (V) of for instance, photonic crystals, with ultra-high accuracy\nand speed. However, state-of-the-art models are still far from being directly\napplicable in the real-world: e.g. the correlation coefficient of V\n($V_{coeff}$ ) is only about 80%, which is much lower than what it takes to\ngenerate reliable and reproducible nanophotonic designs. Recently,\nattention-based transformer models have attracted extensive interests and been\nwidely used in CV and NLP. In this work, we propose the first-ever Transformer\nmodel (POViT) to efficiently design and simulate semiconductor photonic devices\nwith multiple objectives. Unlike the standard Vision Transformer (ViT), we\nsupplied photonic crystals as data input and changed the activation layer from\nGELU to an absolute-value function (ABS). Our experiments show that POViT\nexceeds results reported by previous models significantly. The correlation\ncoefficient $V_{coeff}$ increases by over 12% (i.e., to 92.0%) and the\nprediction errors of Q is reduced by an order of magnitude, among several other\nkey metric improvements. Our work has the potential to drive the expansion of\nEDA to fully automated photonic design.

This paper proposes a novel tree-constrained\npointer generator (TCPGen) component that enables end-to-end ASR models to bias\ntowards a list of long-tail words obtained using external contextual\ninformation. With only a small overhead in memory use and computation cost,\nTCPGen can structure thousands of biasing words efficiently into a symbolic\nprefix-tree and creates a neural shortcut between the tree and the final ASR\noutput to facilitate the recognition of the biasing words. To enhance TCPGen,\nwe further propose a novel minimum biasing word error (MBWE) loss that directly\noptimises biasing word errors during training, along with a biasing-word-driven\nlanguage model discounting (BLMD) method during the test. All contextual ASR\nsystems were evaluated on the public Librispeech audiobook corpus and the data\nfrom the dialogue state tracking challenges (DSTC) with the biasing lists\nextracted from the dialogue-system ontology. Consistent word error rate (WER)\nreductions were achieved with TCPGen, which were particularly significant on\nthe biasing words with around 40\\% relative reductions in the recognition error\nrates. MBWE and BLMD further improved the effectiveness of TCPGen and achieved\nmore significant WER reductions on the biasing words. TCPGen also achieved\nzero-shot learning of words not in the audio training set with large WER\nreductions on the out-of-vocabulary words in the biasing list.",

In this paper, we propose tackling\nboth of these challenges via Automatic Rule Induction (ARI), a simple and\ngeneral-purpose framework for the automatic discovery and integration of\nsymbolic rules into pretrained transformer models. First, we extract weak\nsymbolic rules from low-capacity machine learning models trained on small\namounts of labeled data. Next, we use an attention mechanism to integrate these\nrules into high-capacity pretrained transformer models. Last, the\nrule-augmented system becomes part of a self-training framework to boost\nsupervision signal on unlabeled data. These steps can be layered beneath a\nvariety of existing weak supervision and semi-supervised NLP algorithms in\norder to improve performance and interpretability.

However, conversational question\nanswering (ConvQA) systems have long been stymied by scarce training data that\nis expensive to collect. To address this problem, we propose a new technique\nfor synthetically generating diverse and high-quality dialog data: dialog\ninpainting. Our approach takes the text of any document and transforms it into\na two-person dialog between the writer and an imagined reader: we treat\nsentences from the article as utterances spoken by the writer, and then use a\ndialog inpainter to predict what the imagined reader asked or said in between\neach of the writer's utterances. By applying this approach to passages from\nWikipedia and the web, we produce WikiDialog and WebDialog, two datasets\ntotalling 19 million diverse information-seeking dialogs -- 1,000x larger than\nthe largest existing ConvQA dataset. Furthermore, human raters judge the answer\nadequacy and conversationality of WikiDialog to be as good or better than\nexisting manually-collected datasets. Using our inpainted data to pre-train\nConvQA retrieval systems, we significantly advance state-of-the-art across\nthree benchmarks (QReCC, OR-QuAC, TREC CAsT) yielding up to 40% relative gains\non standard evaluation metrics.",

    "abstract": "Pluralistic image completion focuses on generating both visually realistic\nand diverse results for image completion. Prior methods enjoy the empirical\nsuccesses of this task. However, their used constraints for pluralistic image\ncompletion are argued to be not well interpretable and unsatisfactory from two\naspects. First, the constraints for visual reality can be weakly correlated to\nthe objective of image completion or even redundant. Second, the constraints\nfor diversity are designed to be task-agnostic, which causes the constraints to\nnot work well. In this paper, to address the issues, we propose an end-to-end\nprobabilistic method. Specifically, we introduce a unified probabilistic graph\nmodel that represents the complex interactions in image completion. The entire\nprocedure of image completion is then mathematically divided into several\nsub-procedures, which helps efficient enforcement of constraints. The\nsub-procedure directly related to pluralistic results is identified, where the\ninteraction is established by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The inherent\nparameters of GMM are task-related, which are optimized adaptively during\ntraining, while the number of its primitives can control the diversity of\nresults conveniently.

The\ntechnique we propose is highly flexible as it can be integrated with any online\nlearning algorithm, requiring minimal implementation effort and computational\ncost. A key advantage of our method over existing alternatives -- which also\nbuild on conformal inference -- is that we do not need to split the data into\ntraining and holdout calibration sets. This allows us to fit the predictive\nmodel in a fully online manner, utilizing the most recent observation for\nconstructing calibrated uncertainty sets. Consequently, and in contrast with\nexisting techniques, (i) the sets we build can quickly adapt to new changes in\nthe distribution; and (ii) our procedure does not require refitting the model\nat each time step. Using synthetic and real-world benchmark data sets, we\ndemonstrate the validity of our theory and the improved performance of our\nproposal over existing techniques.

To reduce the\noutage probability and improve the quality of service, existing researches\nusually rely on the assumption of both exact instantaneous channel state\ninformation (CSI) and environmental uncertainty. However, it is difficult to\nobtain perfect instantaneous CSI immediately under practical situations where\nchannel states change rapidly, and the uncertainty in communication\nenvironments may not be observed, which makes traditional methods not\napplicable. Therefore, we turn to reinforcement learning (RL) methods for\nsolutions, which do not need any prior knowledge of underlying channel or\nassumptions of environmental uncertainty. RL method is to learn from the\ninteraction with communication environment, optimize its action policy, and\nthen propose relay selection and power allocation schemes. We first analyse the\nrobustness of RL action policy by giving the lower bound of the worst-case\nperformance, when RL methods are applied to communication scenarios with\nenvironment uncertainty. Then, we propose a robust algorithm for outage\nprobability minimization based on RL. Simulation results reveal that compared\nwith traditional RL methods, our approach has better generalization ability and\ncan improve the worst-case performance by about 6% when evaluated in unseen\nenvironments.",

In this\npaper we present BodyMap, a new framework for obtaining high-definition\nfull-body and continuous dense correspondence between in-the-wild images of\nclothed humans and the surface of a 3D template model. The correspondences\ncover fine details such as hands and hair, while capturing regions far from the\nbody surface, such as loose clothing. Prior methods for estimating such dense\nsurface correspondence i) cut a 3D body into parts which are unwrapped to a 2D\nUV space, producing discontinuities along part seams, or ii) use a single\nsurface for representing the whole body, but none handled body details. Here,\nwe introduce a novel network architecture with Vision Transformers that learn\nfine-level features on a continuous body surface. BodyMap outperforms prior\nwork on various metrics and datasets, including DensePose-COCO by a large\nmargin. Furthermore, we show various applications ranging from multi-layer\ndense cloth correspondence, neural rendering with novel-view synthesis and\nappearance swapping.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies a conceptually simple extension of Masked Autoencoders\n(MAE) to spatiotemporal representation learning from videos. We randomly mask\nout spacetime patches in videos and learn an autoencoder to reconstruct them in\npixels. Interestingly, we show that our MAE method can learn strong\nrepresentations with almost no inductive bias on spacetime (only except for\npatch and positional embeddings), and spacetime-agnostic random masking\nperforms the best. We observe that the optimal masking ratio is as high as 90%\n(vs. 75% on images), supporting the hypothesis that this ratio is related to\ninformation redundancy of the data. A high masking ratio leads to a large\nspeedup, e.g., > 4x in wall-clock time or even more. We report competitive\nresults on several challenging video datasets using vanilla Vision\nTransformers. We observe that MAE can outperform supervised pre-training by\nlarge margins. We further report encouraging results of training on real-world,\nuncurated Instagram data.

    "abstract": "Wireless communication using electro-magnetic (EM) fields acts as the\nbackbone for information exchange among wearable devices around the human body.\nHowever, for Implanted devices, EM fields incur high amount of absorption in\nthe tissue, while alternative modes of transmission including ultrasound,\noptical and magneto-electric methods result in large amount of transduction\nlosses due to conversion of one form of energy to another, thereby increasing\nthe overall end-to-end energy loss. To solve the challenge of powering and\ncommunication in a brain implant with low end-end channel loss, we present\nBi-Phasic Quasistatic Brain Communication (BP-QBC), achieving < 60dB worst-case\nend-to-end channel loss at a channel length of 55mm, by avoiding the\ntransduction losses during field-modality conversion. BP-QBC utilizes dipole\ncoupling based signal transmission within the brain tissue using differential\nexcitation in the transmitter and differential signal pick-up at the receiver,\nand offers 41X lower power w.r.t. traditional Galvanic Human Body Communication\nat a carrier frequency of 1MHz, by blocking any DC current paths through the\nbrain tissue. Since the electrical signal transfer through the human tissue is\nelectro-quasistatic up to several 10's of MHz range, BP-QBC allows a scalable\n(bps-10Mbps) duty-cycled uplink from the implant to an external wearable. The\npower consumption in the BP-QBC TX is only 0.52uW at 1Mbps (with 1% duty\ncycling), which is within the range of harvested body-coupled power in the\ndownlink from an external wearable to the brain implant. Furthermore, BP-QBC\neliminates the need for sub-cranial repeaters, as it utilizes quasi-static\nelectrical signals, thereby avoiding any transduction losses. Such low\nend-to-end channel loss with high data rates would find applications in\nneuroscience, brain-machine interfaces, electroceuticals and connected\nhealthcare.",

    "abstract": "One of the most challenging scenarios for smart speakers is multi-talker,\nwhen target speech from the desired speaker is mixed with interfering speech\nfrom one or more speakers. A smart assistant needs to determine which voice to\nrecognize and which to ignore and it needs to do so in a streaming, low-latency\nmanner. This work presents two multi-microphone speech enhancement algorithms\ntargeted at this scenario. Targeting on-device use-cases, we assume that the\nalgorithm has access to the signal before the hotword, which is referred to as\nthe noise context. First is the Context Aware Beamformer which uses the noise\ncontext and detected hotword to determine how to target the desired speaker.\nThe second is an adaptive noise cancellation algorithm called Speech Cleaner\nwhich trains a filter using the noise context. It is demonstrated that the two\nalgorithms are complementary in the signal-to-noise ratio conditions under\nwhich they work well. We also propose an algorithm to select which one to use\nbased on estimated SNR.

    "abstract": "Faced with massive data, subsampling is a commonly used technique to improve\ncomputational efficiency, and using nonuniform subsampling probabilities is an\neffective approach to improve estimation efficiency. For computational\nefficiency, subsampling is often implemented with replacement or through\nPoisson subsampling. However, no rigorous investigation has been performed to\nstudy the difference between the two subsampling procedures such as their\nestimation efficiency and computational convenience. This paper performs a\ncomparative study on these two different sampling procedures. In the context of\nmaximizing a general target function, we first derive asymptotic distributions\nfor estimators obtained from the two sampling procedures. The results show that\nthe Poisson subsampling may have a higher estimation efficiency. Based on the\nasymptotic distributions for both subsampling with replacement and Poisson\nsubsampling, we derive optimal subsampling probabilities that minimize the\nvariance functions of the subsampling estimators. These subsampling\nprobabilities further reveal the similarities and differences between\nsubsampling with replacement and Poisson subsampling. The theoretical\ncharacterizations and comparisons on the two subsampling procedures provide\nguidance to select a more appropriate subsampling approach in practice.\nFurthermore, practically implementable algorithms are proposed based on the\noptimal structural results, which are evaluated through both theoretical and\nempirical analyses.",

As such, there is much interest in\nestablishing when the algorithm may possess a \"linear\" $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$\ndimension-free iteration complexity comparable to projected gradient descent.\nIn this paper, we provide a general technique for establishing domain\nspecific and easy-to-estimate lower bounds for Frank-Wolfe and its variants\nusing the metric entropy of the domain. Most notably, we show that a\ndimension-free linear upper bound must fail not only in the worst case, but in\nthe \\emph{average case}: for a Gaussian or spherical random polytope in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\\mathrm{poly}(d)$ vertices, Frank-Wolfe requires up to\n$\\tilde\\Omega(d)$ iterations to achieve a $O(1/d)$ error bound, with high\nprobability.

    "abstract": "Prediction intervals offer an effective tool for quantifying the uncertainty\nof loads in distribution systems. The traditional central PIs cannot adapt well\nto skewed distributions, and their offline training fashion is vulnerable to\nunforeseen changes in future load patterns. Therefore, we propose an optimal PI\nestimation approach, which is online and adaptive to different data\ndistributions by adaptively determining symmetric or asymmetric probability\nproportion pairs for quantiles. It relies on the online learning ability of\nreinforcement learning to integrate the two online tasks, i.e., the adaptive\nselection of probability proportion pairs and quantile predictions, both of\nwhich are modeled by neural networks. As such, the quality of quantiles-formed\nPI can guide the selection process of optimal probability proportion pairs,\nwhich forms a closed loop to improve the quality of PIs. Furthermore, to\nimprove the learning efficiency of quantile forecasts, a prioritized experience\nreplay strategy is proposed for online quantile regression processes. Case\nstudies on both load and net load demonstrate that the proposed method can\nbetter adapt to data distribution compared with online central PIs method.\nCompared with offline-trained methods, it obtains PIs with better quality and\nis more robust against concept drift.",

The binaural MFMVDR filters\nare embedded in an end-to-end deep learning framework, where the required\nparameters, i.e., the speech spatio-temporal correlation vectors as well as the\n(inverse) noise spatio-temporal covariance matrix, are estimated by temporal\nconvolutional networks (TCNs) that are trained by minimizing the mean spectral\nabsolute error loss function. Simulation results comprising measured binaural\nroom impulses and diverse noise sources at signal-to-noise ratios from -5 dB to\n20 dB demonstrate the advantage of utilizing the binaural MFMVDR filter\nstructure over directly estimating the binaural multi-frame filter coefficients\nwith TCNs.",

    "abstract": "In mobile speech communication applications, wind noise can lead to a severe\nreduction of speech quality and intelligibility. Since the performance of\nspeech enhancement algorithms using acoustic microphones tends to substantially\ndegrade in extremely challenging scenarios, auxiliary sensors such as contact\nmicrophones can be used. Although contact microphones offer a much lower\nrecorded wind noise level, they come at the cost of speech distortion and\nadditional noise components. Aiming at exploiting the advantages of acoustic\nand contact microphones for wind noise reduction, in this paper we propose to\nextend conventional single-microphone dictionary-based speech enhancement\napproaches by simultaneously modeling the acoustic and contact microphone\nsignals. We propose to train a single speech dictionary and two noise\ndictionaries and use a relative transfer function to model the relationship\nbetween the speech components at the microphones. Simulation results show that\nthe proposed approach yields improvements in both speech quality and\nintelligibility compared to several baseline approaches, most notably\napproaches using only the contact microphones or only the acoustic microphone.",

    "title": "Exact Gaussian Processes for Massive Datasets via Non-Stationary  Sparsity-Discovering Kernels",
    "abstract": "A Gaussian Process (GP) is a prominent mathematical framework for stochastic\nfunction approximation in science and engineering applications. This success is\nlargely attributed to the GP's analytical tractability, robustness,\nnon-parametric structure, and natural inclusion of uncertainty quantification.\nUnfortunately, the use of exact GPs is prohibitively expensive for large\ndatasets due to their unfavorable numerical complexity of $O(N^3)$ in\ncomputation and $O(N^2)$ in storage. All existing methods addressing this issue\nutilize some form of approximation -- usually considering subsets of the full\ndataset or finding representative pseudo-points that render the covariance\nmatrix well-structured and sparse. These approximate methods can lead to\ninaccuracies in function approximations and often limit the user's flexibility\nin designing expressive kernels. Instead of inducing sparsity via data-point\ngeometry and structure, we propose to take advantage of naturally-occurring\nsparsity by allowing the kernel to discover -- instead of induce -- sparse\nstructure. The premise of this paper is that GPs, in their most native form,\nare often naturally sparse, but commonly-used kernels do not allow us to\nexploit this sparsity. The core concept of exact, and at the same time sparse\nGPs relies on kernel definitions that provide enough flexibility to learn and\nencode not only non-zero but also zero covariances. This principle of\nultra-flexible, compactly-supported, and non-stationary kernels, combined with\nHPC and constrained optimization, lets us scale exact GPs well beyond 5 million\ndata points.",

    "abstract": "Accurate predictions of the failure progression of structural materials is\ncritical for preventing failure-induced accidents. Despite considerable\nmechanics modeling-based efforts, accurate prediction remains a challenging\ntask in real-world environments due to unexpected damage factors and defect\nevolutions. Here, we report a novel method for predicting material failure\ncharacteristics that uniquely combines nondestructive X-ray computed tomography\n(X-CT), persistent homology (PH), and deep multimodal learning (DML). The\ncombined method exploits the microstructural defect state at the time of\nmaterial examination as an input, and outputs the failure-related properties.\nOur method is demonstrated to be effective using two types of fracture datasets\n(tensile and fatigue datasets) with ferritic low alloy steel as a\nrepresentative structural material. The method achieves a mean absolute error\n(MAE) of 0.09 in predicting the local strain with the tensile dataset and an\nMAE of 0.14 in predicting the fracture progress with the fatigue dataset. These\nhigh accuracies are mainly due to PH processing of the X-CT images, which\ntransforms complex and noisy three-dimensional X-CT images into compact\ntwo-dimensional persistence diagrams that preserve key topological features\nsuch as the internal void size, density, and distribution. The combined PH and\nDML processing of 3D X-CT data is our unique approach enabling reliable failure\npredictions at the time of material examination based on void topology\nprogressions, and the method can be extended to various nondestructive failure\ntests for practical use.",

    "abstract": "We study the multisecretary problem with capacity to hire up to $B$ out of\n$T$ candidates, and values drawn i.i.d. from a distribution $F$ on $[0,1]$. We\ninvestigate achievable regret performance, where the latter is defined as the\ndifference between the performance of an oracle with perfect information of\nfuture types (values) and an online policy. While the case of distributions\nover a few discrete types is well understood, very little is known when there\nare many types, with the exception of the special case of a uniform\ndistribution of types. In this work we consider a larger class of distributions\nwhich includes the few discrete types as a special case. We first establish the\ninsufficiency of the common certainty equivalent heuristic for distributions\nwith many types and \"gaps\" (intervals) of absent types; even for simple\ndeviations from the uniform distribution, it leads to regret\n$\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$, as large as that of a non-adaptive algorithm. We introduce\na new algorithmic principle which we call \"conservativeness with respect to\ngaps\" (CwG), and use it to design an algorithm that applies to any\ndistribution. We establish that the proposed algorithm yields optimal regret\nscaling of $\\tilde{\\Theta}(T^{1/2 - 1/(2(\\beta + 1))})$ for a broad class of\ndistributions with gaps, where $\\beta$ quantifies the mass accumulation of\ntypes around gaps. We recover constant regret scaling for the special case of a\nbounded number of types ($\\beta=0$ in this case). In most practical network\nrevenue management problems, the number of types is large and the current\ncertainty equivalent heuristics scale poorly with the number of types. The new\nalgorithmic principle called \\emph{Conservatism w.r.t Gaps} (CwG) that we\ndeveloped, can pave the way for progress on handling many types for the broader\nclass of network revenue management problems like order fulfillment and online\nmatching.",

    "abstract": "Interlayer link prediction aims at matching the same entities across\ndifferent layers of the multiplex network. Existing studies attempt to predict\nmore accurately, efficiently, or generically from the aspects of network\nstructure, attribute characteristics, and their combination. Few of them\nanalyze the effects of intralayer links. Namely, few works study the backbone\nstructures which can effectively preserve the predictive accuracy while dealing\nwith a smaller number of intralayer links. It can be used to investigate what\ntypes of intralayer links are most important for correct prediction. Are there\nany intralayer links whose presence leads to worse predictive performance than\ntheir absence, and how to attack the prediction algorithms at the minimum cost?\nTo this end, two kinds of network structural perturbation methods are proposed.\nFor the scenario where the structural information of the whole network is\ncompletely known, we offer a global perturbation strategy that gives different\nperturbation weights to different types of intralayer links and then selects a\npredetermined proportion of intralayer links to remove according to the\nweights. In contrast, if these information cannot be obtained at one time, we\ndesign a biased random walk procedure, local perturbation strategy, to execute\nperturbation. Four kinds of interlayer link prediction algorithms are carried\nout on different real-world and artificial perturbed multiplex networks.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) models for medical image segmentation are highly\ninfluenced by intensity variations of input images and lack generalization due\nto primarily utilizing pixels' intensity information for inference. Acquiring\nsufficient training data is another challenge limiting models' applications. We\nproposed to leverage the consistency of organs' anatomical shape and position\ninformation in medical images. We introduced a framework leveraging recurring\nanatomical patterns through global binary masks for organ segmentation. Two\nscenarios were studied.1) Global binary masks were the only model's (i.e.\nU-Net) input, forcing exclusively encoding organs' position and shape\ninformation for segmentation/localization.2) Global binary masks were\nincorporated as an additional channel functioning as position/shape clues to\nmitigate training data scarcity. Two datasets of the brain and heart CT images\nwith their ground-truth were split into (26:10:10) and (12:3:5) for training,\nvalidation, and test respectively. Training exclusively on global binary masks\nled to Dice scores of 0.77(0.06) and 0.85(0.04), with the average Euclidian\ndistance of 3.12(1.43)mm and 2.5(0.93)mm relative to the center of mass of the\nground truth for the brain and heart structures respectively. The outcomes\nindicate that a surprising degree of position and shape information is encoded\nthrough global binary masks. Incorporating global binary masks led to\nsignificantly higher accuracy relative to the model trained on only CT images\nin small subsets of training data; the performance improved by 4.3-125.3% and\n1.3-48.1% for 1-8 training cases of the brain and heart datasets respectively.\nThe findings imply the advantages of utilizing global binary masks for building\ngeneralizable models and to compensate for training data scarcity.",
