    "title": "Virtual and Augmented Reality-Based Assistive Interfaces for Upper-limb  Prosthesis Control and Rehabilitation",
    "abstract": "Functional upper-limb prosthetic training can improve users performance in\ncontrolling prostheses and has been incorporated into occupational therapy for\nindividuals in need. In recent years, virtual reality (VR) and augmented\nreality (AR) technologies have been shown to be promising avenues to improve\nthe convenience of rehabilitative prosthesis training systems. However, it is\nuncertain if the comprehensive efficacy and effectiveness of VR or AR assistive\ntools are adequate compared to conventional prosthetic tools and if not,\nwhether enhancements can be made through incorporation of other technical\nparadigms.\nThis work first presents a mixed reality system we developed for prosthesis\ncontrol and training. Five able-bodied subjects are involved to perform\nthree-dimensional object manipulation tasks in analogous AR and VR\nenvironments. Multiple evaluation metrics are applied to assess subjects\nperformances within the two paradigms. Based on the comparative analysis, we\nfind that VR-based environment promotes more efficient motion along with higher\ntask completion rate and path efficiency while AR paradigm allows subjects to\nperform motor tasks with shorter time consumed. Another study is conducted to\nevaluate the efficiency and feasibility of AR-facilitated prosthesis control\nsystem compared to that in real-world and if any technical additions can be\napplied to improve the AR-based system. Three able-bodied subjects were engaged\nin the experiment to perform object manipulation tasks in a) physical\nenvironment, b) AR-without-bypass environment, and c) AR-with-bypass\nenvironment. Based on the results obtained from the assessment, we conclude\nthat while our AR-based system modestly lags behind the effectiveness of\nphysical systems, the study conducted using a bypass prosthesis suggests that\nAR system has the potential to improve the efficacy of prosthesis control.",

    "abstract": "Pearl's do calculus is a complete axiomatic approach to learn the\nidentifiable causal effects from observational data. When such an effect is not\nidentifiable, it is necessary to perform a collection of often costly\ninterventions in the system to learn the causal effect. In this work, we\nconsider the problem of designing the collection of interventions with the\nminimum cost to identify the desired effect. First, we prove that this problem\nis NP-hard, and subsequently propose an algorithm that can either find the\noptimal solution or a logarithmic-factor approximation of it. This is done by\nestablishing a connection between our problem and the minimum hitting set\nproblem. Additionally, we propose several polynomial-time heuristic algorithms\nto tackle the computational complexity of the problem. Although these\nalgorithms could potentially stumble on sub-optimal solutions, our simulations\nshow that they achieve small regrets on random graphs.",

    "abstract": "A reservoir computer is a type of dynamical system arranged to do\ncomputation. Typically, a reservoir computer is constructed by connecting a\nlarge number of nonlinear nodes in a network that includes recurrent\nconnections. In order to achieve accurate results, the reservoir usually\ncontains hundreds to thousands of nodes. This high dimensionality makes it\ndifficult to analyze the reservoir computer using tools from dynamical systems\ntheory. Additionally, the need to create and connect large numbers of nonlinear\nnodes makes it difficult to design and build analog reservoir computers that\ncan be faster and consume less power than digital reservoir computers. We\ndemonstrate here that a reservoir computer may be divided into two parts; a\nsmall set of nonlinear nodes (the reservoir), and a separate set of\ntime-shifted reservoir output signals. The time-shifted output signals serve to\nincrease the rank and memory of the reservoir computer, and the set of\nnonlinear nodes may create an embedding of the input dynamical system. We use\nthis time-shifting technique to obtain excellent performance from an\nopto-electronic delay-based reservoir computer with only a small number of\nvirtual nodes. Because only a few nonlinear nodes are required, construction of\na reservoir computer becomes much easier, and delay-based reservoir computers\ncan operate at much higher speeds.",

Programming quantum computers requires awareness of\nentanglement, the phenomenon in which measurement outcomes of qubits are\ncorrelated. Entanglement can determine the correctness of algorithms and\nsuitability of programming patterns.\nIn this work, we formalize purity as a central tool for automating reasoning\nabout entanglement in quantum programs. A pure expression is one whose\nevaluation is unaffected by the measurement outcomes of qubits that it does not\nown, implying freedom from entanglement with any other expression in the\ncomputation.\nWe present Twist, the first language that features a type system for sound\nreasoning about purity. The type system enables the developer to identify pure\nexpressions using type annotations. Twist also features purity assertion\noperators that state the absence of entanglement in the output of quantum\ngates. To soundly check these assertions, Twist uses a combination of static\nanalysis and runtime verification.\nWe evaluate Twist's type system and analyses on a benchmark suite of quantum\nprograms in simulation, demonstrating that Twist can express quantum\nalgorithms, catch programming errors in them, and support programs that several\nlanguages disallow, while incurring runtime verification overhead of less than\n3.5%.",

The\nincreasing expansion of network attack surfaces and the exponentially growing\nnumber of assets on these networks necessitate the need for a robust AI-based\nZero Day Threat detection model that can quickly analyze petabyte-scale data\nfor potentially malicious and novel activity.

The key ingredient of the\napproach is a polynomial mapping between high-dimensional states and a\nlow-dimensional embedding. This mapping comprises two parts: a representation\nin a linear subspace (computed in this work using the proper orthogonal\ndecomposition) and a quadratic component. The approach can be viewed as a form\nof data-driven closure modeling, since the quadratic component introduces\ndirections into the approximation that lie in the orthogonal complement of the\nlinear subspace, but without introducing any additional degrees of freedom to\nthe low-dimensional representation. Combining the quadratic manifold\napproximation with the operator inference method for projection-based model\nreduction leads to a scalable non-intrusive approach for learning reduced-order\nmodels of dynamical systems.

    "title": "Towards Robust and Semantically Organised Latent Representations for  Unsupervised Text Style Transfer",
    "abstract": "Recent studies show that auto-encoder based approaches successfully perform\nlanguage generation, smooth sentence interpolation, and style transfer over\nunseen attributes using unlabelled datasets in a zero-shot manner. The latent\nspace geometry of such models is organised well enough to perform on datasets\nwhere the style is \"coarse-grained\" i.e. a small fraction of words alone in a\nsentence are enough to determine the overall style label. A recent study uses a\ndiscrete token-based perturbation approach to map \"similar\" sentences\n(\"similar\" defined by low Levenshtein distance/ high word overlap) close by in\nlatent space. This definition of \"similarity\" does not look into the underlying\nnuances of the constituent words while mapping latent space neighbourhoods and\ntherefore fails to recognise sentences with different style-based semantics\nwhile mapping latent neighbourhoods. We introduce EPAAEs (Embedding Perturbed\nAdversarial AutoEncoders) which completes this perturbation model, by adding a\nfinely adjustable noise component on the continuous embeddings space. We\nempirically show that this (a) produces a better organised latent space that\nclusters stylistically similar sentences together, (b) performs best on a\ndiverse set of text style transfer tasks than similar denoising-inspired\nbaselines, and (c) is capable of fine-grained control of Style Transfer\nstrength. We also extend the text style transfer tasks to NLI datasets and show\nthat these more complex definitions of style are learned best by EPAAE. To the\nbest of our knowledge, extending style transfer to NLI tasks has not been\nexplored before.",

    "abstract": "Surface hopping algorithms, as an important class of quantum dynamics\nsimulation algorithms for non-adiabatic dynamics, are typically performed in\nthe adiabatic representation, which can break down in the presence of\nill-defined adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) and adiabatic coupling\nterm. Another issue of surface hopping algorithms is the difficulty in\ncapturing the correct scaling of the transition rate in the Marcus\n(weak-coupling/non-adiabatic) regime. Though the first issue can be\ncircumvented by exploiting the diabatic representation, diabatic surface\nhopping algorithms usually lack justification on the theoretical level. We\nconsider the diabatic surface hopping algorithm proposed in [Fang, Lu.\nMultiscale Model. Simul. 16:4, 1603-1622, 2018] and provide the asymptotic\nanalysis of the transition rate in the Marcus regime that justifies the correct\nscaling for the spin-boson model. We propose two conditions that guarantee the\ncorrectness for general potentials. In the opposite (strong-coupling/adiabatic)\nregime, we derive the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm that interestingly\nmatches a type of mean-field description. The techniques used here may shed\nlight on the analysis for other diabatic-based algorithms.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new strategy for applying large pre-trained language models to\nnovel tasks when labeled training data is limited. Rather than apply the model\nin a typical zero-shot or few-shot fashion, we treat the model as the basis for\nlabeling functions in a weak supervision framework. To create a classifier, we\nfirst prompt the model to answer multiple distinct queries about an example and\ndefine how the possible responses should be mapped to votes for labels and\nabstentions. We then denoise these noisy label sources using the Snorkel system\nand train an end classifier with the resulting training data. Our experimental\nevaluation shows that prompting large language models within a weak supervision\nframework can provide significant gains in accuracy. On the WRENCH weak\nsupervision benchmark, this approach can significantly improve over zero-shot\nperformance, an average 19.5% reduction in errors.

Our analysis\nreveals a pattern of segmented immobility, where fewer people migrate between\ncounties with dissimilar political contexts, levels of urbanization, and racial\ncompositions. Probing our model using \"knockout\" experiments suggests that one\nwould have observed approximately 3 million (17%) more intercounty migrants\nover the study period were the segmented immobility mechanisms inoperative.\nThis analysis suggests that internal migration in the current era is driven not\nonly by demographic and economic factors, but also cultural and political ones.\nIt also reveals social and political cleavages that underlie geographical\nimmobility in America.",

We also prove that, in case no\nsplitting of the same job on a machine is allowed (i.e., job part assigned to a\nmachine is to be processed without an interruption on that machine), the\nproblem is NP-hard. As a side result, we obtain that, whenever job splitting is\nnot allowed, given an optimal LP solution, it is NP-hard to find an optimal\nschedule with the minimum makespan that agrees with that LP solution.

To validate model performance, we also collected a set of paired\nshoe-sole images and corresponding prints, and define a benchmarking protocol\nto quantify the accuracy of predicted impressions. On this benchmark,\nShoeRinsics outperforms existing methods for depth prediction and\nsynthetic-to-real domain adaptation.",

    "abstract": "This research developed a Kencorpus Swahili Question Answering Dataset\nKenSwQuAD from raw data of Swahili language, which is a low resource language\npredominantly spoken in Eastern African and also has speakers in other parts of\nthe world. Question Answering datasets are important for machine comprehension\nof natural language processing tasks such as internet search and dialog\nsystems. However, before such machine learning systems can perform these tasks,\nthey need training data such as the gold standard Question Answering (QA) set\nthat is developed in this research. The research engaged annotators to\nformulate question answer pairs from Swahili texts that had been collected by\nthe Kencorpus project, a Kenyan languages corpus that collected data from three\nKenyan languages. The total Swahili data collection had 2,585 texts, out of\nwhich we annotated 1,445 story texts with at least 5 QA pairs each, resulting\ninto a final dataset of 7,526 QA pairs. A quality assurance set of 12.5% of the\nannotated texts was subjected to re-evaluation by different annotators who\nconfirmed that the QA pairs were all correctly annotated. A proof of concept on\napplying the set to machine learning on the question answering task confirmed\nthat the dataset can be used for such practical tasks. The research therefore\ndeveloped KenSwQuAD, a question-answer dataset for Swahili that is useful to\nthe natural language processing community who need training and gold standard\nsets for their machine learning applications. The research also contributed to\nthe resourcing of the Swahili language which is important for communication\naround the globe. Updating this set and providing similar sets for other low\nresource languages is an important research area that is worthy of further\nresearch.",

The\nachievements often come with the price of enormous hardware consumption and\nexpensive labor effort for consecutive labeling. A missing ingredient for\nrobust tracking is achieving performance with minimal modification on network\nstructure and semi-supervised learning intermittent labeled frames. In this\npaper, we ad-dress these problems in a Bayesian tracking and detection\nframework parameterized by neural network outputs. In our framework, the\ntracking and detection process is formulated in a probabilistic way as\nmulti-objects dynamics and network detection uncertainties. With our\nformulation, we propose a particle filter-based approximate sampling algorithm\nfor tracking object state estimation. Based on our particle filter inference\nalgorithm, a semi-supervised learn-ing algorithm is utilized for learning\ntracking network on intermittent labeled frames by variational inference. In\nour experiments, we provide both mAP and probability-based detection\nmeasurements for comparison between our algorithm with non-Bayesian solutions.\nWe also train a semi-supervised tracking network on M2Cai16-Tool-Locations\nDataset and compare our results with supervised learning on fully labeled\nframes.",

The\nanalytical component consists of structural explanations that are well-known in\nthe social sciences. The evaluative component is a theory of justice.\nStructural injustice is a powerful conceptual tool that allows researchers and\npractitioners to identify, articulate, and perhaps even anticipate, AI biases.\nThe chapter begins with an example of racial bias in AI that arises from\nstructural injustice. The chapter then presents the concept of structural\ninjustice as introduced by the philosopher Iris Marion Young. The chapter\nmoreover argues that structural injustice is well suited as an approach to the\ngovernance of AI and compares this approach to alternative approaches that\nstart from analyses of harms and benefits or from value statements. The chapter\nsuggests that structural injustice provides methodological and normative\nfoundations for the values and concerns of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.\nThe chapter closes with an outlook onto the idea of structure and on\nresponsibility. The idea of a structure is central to justice. An open\ntheoretical research question is to what extent AI is itself part of the\nstructure of society. Finally, the practice of responsibility is central to\nstructural injustice.

Despite the\nabundance of research in this area, less attention has been given to\nadversarial attacks that force the system to generate toxic language and the\ndefense against them. Existing work to generate such attacks is either based on\nhuman-generated attacks which is costly and not scalable or, in case of\nautomatic attacks, the attack vector does not conform to human-like language,\nwhich can be detected using a language model loss. In this work, we propose\nattacks against conversational agents that are imperceptible, i.e., they fit\nthe conversation in terms of coherency, relevancy, and fluency, while they are\neffective and scalable, i.e., they can automatically trigger the system into\ngenerating toxic language. We then propose a defense mechanism against such\nattacks which not only mitigates the attack but also attempts to maintain the\nconversational flow. Through automatic and human evaluations, we show that our\ndefense is effective at avoiding toxic language generation even against\nimperceptible toxicity triggers while the generated language fits the\nconversation in terms of coherency and relevancy. Lastly, we establish the\ngeneralizability of such a defense mechanism on language generation models\nbeyond conversational agents.",

    "title": "Spot-adaptive Knowledge Distillation",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a well established paradigm for\ncompressing deep neural networks. The typical way of conducting knowledge\ndistillation is to train the student network under the supervision of the\nteacher network to harness the knowledge at one or multiple spots (i.e.,\nlayers) in the teacher network. The distillation spots, once specified, will\nnot change for all the training samples, throughout the whole distillation\nprocess. In this work, we argue that distillation spots should be adaptive to\ntraining samples and distillation epochs. We thus propose a new distillation\nstrategy, termed spot-adaptive KD (SAKD), to adaptively determine the\ndistillation spots in the teacher network per sample, at every training\niteration during the whole distillation period. As SAKD actually focuses on\n\"where to distill\" instead of \"what to distill\" that is widely investigated by\nmost existing works, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing distillation\nmethods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments with 10\nstate-of-the-art distillers are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nSAKD for improving their distillation performance, under both homogeneous and\nheterogeneous distillation settings.

To\nmitigate this gap, we propose DocReL, a Document Relational Representation\nLearning framework. The major challenge of DocReL roots in the variety of\nrelations. From the simplest pairwise relation to the complex global structure,\nit is infeasible to conduct supervised training due to the definition of\nrelation varies and even conflicts in different tasks. To deal with the\nunpredictable definition of relations, we propose a novel contrastive learning\ntask named Relational Consistency Modeling (RCM), which harnesses the fact that\nexisting relations should be consistent in differently augmented positive\nviews. RCM provides relational representations which are more compatible to the\nurgent need of downstream tasks, even without any knowledge about the exact\ndefinition of relation. DocReL achieves better performance on a wide variety of\nVRD relational understanding tasks, including table structure recognition, key\ninformation extraction and reading order detection.",

    "title": "Surface Reconstruction from Point Clouds: A Survey and a Benchmark",
    "abstract": "Reconstruction of a continuous surface of two-dimensional manifold from its\nraw, discrete point cloud observation is a long-standing problem. The problem\nis technically ill-posed, and becomes more difficult considering that various\nsensing imperfections would appear in the point clouds obtained by practical\ndepth scanning. In literature, a rich set of methods has been proposed, and\nreviews of existing methods are also provided. However, existing reviews are\nshort of thorough investigations on a common benchmark. The present paper aims\nto review and benchmark existing methods in the new era of deep learning\nsurface reconstruction. To this end, we contribute a large-scale benchmarking\ndataset consisting of both synthetic and real-scanned data; the benchmark\nincludes object- and scene-level surfaces and takes into account various\nsensing imperfections that are commonly encountered in practical depth\nscanning. We conduct thorough empirical studies by comparing existing methods\non the constructed benchmark, and pay special attention on robustness of\nexisting methods against various scanning imperfections; we also study how\ndifferent methods generalize in terms of reconstructing complex surface shapes.\nOur studies help identify the best conditions under which different methods\nwork, and suggest some empirical findings. For example, while deep learning\nmethods are increasingly popular, our systematic studies suggest that,\nsurprisingly, a few classical methods perform even better in terms of both\nrobustness and generalization; our studies also suggest that the practical\nchallenges of misalignment of point sets from multi-view scanning, missing of\nsurface points, and point outliers remain unsolved by all the existing surface\nreconstruction methods. We expect that the benchmark and our studies would be\nvaluable both for practitioners and as a guidance for new innovations in future\nresearch.",

    "abstract": "Future communication systems (6G and beyond) will witness a paradigm shift\nfrom communication-intensive systems towards intelligent computing-intensive\narchitectures. A key research area that enables this transition is semantic\ncommunications, whereby the communication process conveys the meaning of\nmessages instead of being a mere reconstruction process of raw, naive data\nbits. In this paper, a novel quantum semantic communications (QSC) framework is\nproposed to develop reasoning-based future communication systems with quantum\nsemantic representations that are characterized with minimalism, efficiency,\nand accuracy. In particular, the concepts of quantum embedding and\nhigh-dimensional Hilbert spaces are exploited so as to extract the meaning of\nclassical data. Moreover, in order to equip our approach with minimalism and\nefficiency, an unsupervised quantum machine learning (QML) technique, namely,\nquantum clustering is employed. Quantum clustering enables extraction of\ncontextual information and distinct characterization of the semantics of the\nmessage to be conveyed. Subsequently, to successfully transmit the constructed\nsemantic representations, quantum communication links are used to transfer the\nquantum states. This new QSC framework exploits unique quantum principles such\nas the minimalism of entangled photons, quantum-semantic entropy of noise, and\nquantum fidelity. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can save\naround 85\\% of quantum communication resources, i.e., entangled photons,\ncompared to semantic-agnostic quantum communication schemes.

This paper proposes a unified framework for the joint estimation of\nthe unknown timing offsets and the RIS channel parameters, as well as the\ndesign of cooperative reflection and synchronization algorithm for the\ndistributed multiple-RIS communication. Considering that RIS is usually a\npassive device with limited capability of signal processing, the individual\ntiming offset and channel gains of each hop of the RIS links cannot be directly\nestimated. To make the estimation tractable, we propose to estimate the\ncascaded channels and timing offsets jointly by deriving a maximum likelihood\nestimator. Furthermore, we theoretically characterize the Cramer-Rao lower\nbound (CRLB) to evaluate the accuracy of this estimator. By using the proposed\nestimator and the derived CRLBs, an efficient resynchronization algorithm is\ndevised jointly at the RISs and the destination to compensate the multiple\ntiming offsets. Based on the majorization-minimization framework, the proposed\nalgorithm admits semi-closed and closed form solutions for the RIS reflection\nmatrices and the timing offset equalizer, respectively.

In contrast to most existing studies that can only characterize\naverage delay performance, we focus on the critical goal of delivering AgI\nservices ahead of corresponding deadlines on a per-packet basis, while\nminimizing overall cloud network operational cost. To this end, we design a\nnovel queuing system able to track data packets' lifetime and formalize the\ndelay-constrained least-cost dynamic network control problem. To address this\nchallenging problem, we first study the setting with average capacity (or\nresource budget) constraints, for which we characterize the delay-constrained\nstability region and design a near-optimal control policy leveraging Lyapunov\noptimization theory on an equivalent virtual network. Guided by the same\nprinciple, we tackle the peak capacity constrained scenario by developing the\nreliable cloud network control (RCNC) algorithm, which employs a two-way\noptimization method to make actual and virtual network flow solutions converge\nin an iterative manner.

    "abstract": "Recently, industrial recommendation services have been boosted by the\ncontinual upgrade of deep learning methods. However, they still face de-biasing\nchallenges such as exposure bias and cold-start problem, where circulations of\nmachine learning training on human interaction history leads algorithms to\nrepeatedly suggest exposed items while ignoring less-active ones. Additional\nproblems exist in multi-scenario platforms, e.g. appropriate data fusion from\nsubsidiary scenarios, which we observe could be alleviated through graph\nstructured data integration via message passing.\nIn this paper, we present a multi-graph structured multi-scenario\nrecommendation solution, which encapsulates interaction data across scenarios\nwith multi-graph and obtains representation via graph learning. Extensive\noffline and online experiments on real-world datasets are conducted where the\nproposed method demonstrates an increase of 0.63% and 0.71% in CTR and Video\nViews per capita on new users over deployed set of baselines and outperforms\nregular method in increasing the number of outer-scenario videos by 25% and\nvideo watches by 116%, validating its superiority in activating cold videos and\nenriching target recommendation.",

It has been used to characterize the size and\nintensity of a geomagnetic storm. A negative Dst value means that the Earth's\nmagnetic field is weakened, which happens during storms. In this paper, we\npresent a novel deep learning method, called the Dst Transformer, to perform\nshort-term, 1-6 hour ahead, forecasting of the Dst index based on the solar\nwind parameters provided by the NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive.\nThe Dst Transformer combines a multi-head attention layer with Bayesian\ninference, which is capable of quantifying both aleatoric uncertainty and\nepistemic uncertainty when making Dst predictions. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed Dst Transformer outperforms related machine learning methods\nin terms of the root mean square error and R-squared.

    "abstract": "Dynamic mechanism design has garnered significant attention from both\ncomputer scientists and economists in recent years. By allowing agents to\ninteract with the seller over multiple rounds, where agents' reward functions\nmay change with time and are state dependent, the framework is able to model a\nrich class of real world problems. In these works, the interaction between\nagents and sellers are often assumed to follow a Markov Decision Process (MDP).\nWe focus on the setting where the reward and transition functions of such an\nMDP are not known a priori, and we are attempting to recover the optimal\nmechanism using an a priori collected data set. In the setting where the\nfunction approximation is employed to handle large state spaces, with only mild\nassumptions on the expressiveness of the function class, we are able to design\na dynamic mechanism using offline reinforcement learning algorithms. Moreover,\nlearned mechanisms approximately have three key desiderata: efficiency,\nindividual rationality, and truthfulness. Our algorithm is based on the\npessimism principle and only requires a mild assumption on the coverage of the\noffline data set. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first\noffline RL algorithm for dynamic mechanism design without assuming uniform\ncoverage.",

    "abstract": "There has recently been growing interest in the automatic generation of\ncooking recipes that satisfy some form of dietary restrictions, thanks in part\nto the availability of online recipe data. Prior studies have used pre-trained\nlanguage models, or relied on small paired recipe data (e.g., a recipe paired\nwith a similar one that satisfies a dietary constraint). However, pre-trained\nlanguage models generate inconsistent or incoherent recipes, and paired\ndatasets are not available at scale. We address these deficiencies with\nRecipeCrit, a hierarchical denoising auto-encoder that edits recipes given\ningredient-level critiques. The model is trained for recipe completion to learn\nsemantic relationships within recipes. Our work's main innovation is our\nunsupervised critiquing module that allows users to edit recipes by interacting\nwith the predicted ingredients; the system iteratively rewrites recipes to\nsatisfy users' feedback. Experiments on the Recipe1M recipe dataset show that\nour model can more effectively edit recipes compared to strong\nlanguage-modeling baselines, creating recipes that satisfy user constraints and\nare more correct, serendipitous, coherent, and relevant as measured by human\njudges.",

To alleviate the problem, we\npropose an innovative VL fine-tuning paradigm (named Declaration-based Prompt\nTuning, abbreviated as DPT), which jointly optimizes the objectives of\npre-training and fine-tuning of VQA model, boosting the effective adaptation of\npre-trained VL models to the downstream task. Specifically, DPT reformulates\nthe objective form of VQA task via (1) textual adaptation, which converts the\ngiven questions into declarative sentence-form for prompt-tuning, and (2) task\nadaptation, which optimizes the objective function of VQA problem in the manner\nof pre-training phase. Experimental results on GQA dataset show that DPT\noutperforms the fine-tuned counterpart by a large margin regarding accuracy in\nboth fully-supervised (2.68%) and zero-shot/few-shot (over 31%) settings.

The superiority of RSMA-assisted ISAC is verifed\nthrough simulation results in both terrestrial and satellite scenarios.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a pipeline to find the number of speakers, as well\nas audios belonging to each of these now identified speakers in a source of\naudio data where number of speakers or speaker labels are not known a priori.\nWe used this approach as a part of our Data Preparation pipeline for Speech\nRecognition in Indic Languages\n(https://github.com/Open-Speech-EkStep/vakyansh-wav2vec2-experimentation). To\nunderstand and evaluate the accuracy of our proposed pipeline, we introduce two\nmetrics: Cluster Purity, and Cluster Uniqueness. Cluster Purity quantifies how\n\"pure\" a cluster is. Cluster Uniqueness, on the other hand, quantifies what\npercentage of clusters belong only to a single dominant speaker. We discuss\nmore on these metrics in section \\ref{sec:metrics}. Since we develop this\nutility to aid us in identifying data based on speaker IDs before training an\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model, and since most of this data takes\nconsiderable effort to scrape, we also conclude that 98\\% of data gets mapped\nto the top 80\\% of clusters (computed by removing any clusters with less than a\nfixed number of utterances -- we do this to get rid of some very small clusters\nand use this threshold as 30), in the test set chosen.",

    "title": "Exploiting Correspondences with All-pairs Correlations for Multi-view  Depth Estimation",
    "abstract": "Multi-view depth estimation plays a critical role in reconstructing and\nunderstanding the 3D world. Recent learning-based methods have made significant\nprogress in it. However, multi-view depth estimation is fundamentally a\ncorrespondence-based optimization problem, but previous learning-based methods\nmainly rely on predefined depth hypotheses to build correspondence as the cost\nvolume and implicitly regularize it to fit depth prediction, deviating from the\nessence of iterative optimization based on stereo correspondence. Thus, they\nsuffer unsatisfactory precision and generalization capability. In this paper,\nwe are the first to explore more general image correlations to establish\ncorrespondences dynamically for depth estimation. We design a novel iterative\nmulti-view depth estimation framework mimicking the optimization process, which\nconsists of 1) a correlation volume construction module that models the pixel\nsimilarity between a reference image and source images as all-to-all\ncorrelations; 2) a flow-based depth initialization module that estimates the\ndepth from the 2D optical flow; 3) a novel correlation-guided depth refinement\nmodule that reprojects points in different views to effectively fetch relevant\ncorrelations for further fusion and integrate the fused correlation for\niterative depth update. Without predefined depth hypotheses, the fused\ncorrelations establish multi-view correspondence in an efficient way and guide\nthe depth refinement heuristically. We conduct sufficient experiments on\nScanNet, DeMoN, ETH3D, and 7Scenes to demonstrate the superiority of our method\non multi-view depth estimation and its best generalization ability.",

    "abstract": "Online social networks are a dominant medium in everyday life to stay in\ncontact with friends and to share information. In Twitter, users can connect\nwith other users by following them, who in turn can follow back. In recent\nyears, researchers studied several properties of social networks and designed\nrandom graph models to describe them. Many of these approaches either focus on\nthe generation of undirected graphs or on the creation of directed graphs\nwithout modeling the dependencies between reciprocal (i.e., two directed edges\nof opposite direction between two nodes) and directed edges. We propose an\napproach to generate directed social network graphs that creates reciprocal and\ndirected edges and considers the correlation between the respective degree\nsequences.\nOur model relies on crawled directed graphs in Twitter, on which information\nw.r.t. a topic is exchanged or disseminated. While these graphs exhibit a high\nclustering coefficient and small average distances between random node pairs\n(which is typical in real-world networks), their degree sequences seem to\nfollow a $\\chi^2$-distribution rather than power law. To achieve high\nclustering coefficients, we apply an edge rewiring procedure that preserves the\nnode degrees.\nWe compare the crawled and the created graphs, and simulate certain\nalgorithms for information dissemination and epidemic spreading on them. The\nresults show that the created graphs exhibit very similar topological and\nalgorithmic properties as the real-world graphs, providing evidence that they\ncan be used as surrogates in social network analysis. Furthermore, our model is\nhighly scalable, which enables us to create graphs of arbitrary size with\nalmost the same properties as the corresponding real-world networks.",

    "abstract": "Recent work for extracting relations from texts has achieved excellent\nperformance. However, most existing methods pay less attention to the\nefficiency, making it still challenging to quickly extract relations from\nmassive or streaming text data in realistic scenarios. The main efficiency\nbottleneck is that these methods use a Transformer-based pre-trained language\nmodel for encoding, which heavily affects the training speed and inference\nspeed. To address this issue, we propose a fast relation extraction model\n(FastRE) based on convolutional encoder and improved cascade binary tagging\nframework. Compared to previous work, FastRE employs several innovations to\nimprove efficiency while also keeping promising performance. Concretely, FastRE\nadopts a novel convolutional encoder architecture combined with dilated\nconvolution, gated unit and residual connection, which significantly reduces\nthe computation cost of training and inference, while maintaining the\nsatisfactory performance. Moreover, to improve the cascade binary tagging\nframework, FastRE first introduces a type-relation mapping mechanism to\naccelerate tagging efficiency and alleviate relation redundancy, and then\nutilizes a position-dependent adaptive thresholding strategy to obtain higher\ntagging accuracy and better model generalization. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that FastRE is well balanced between efficiency and performance,\nand achieves 3-10x training speed, 7-15x inference speed faster, and 1/100\nparameters compared to the state-of-the-art models, while the performance is\nstill competitive.",

We\nalso conduct extensive experiments to assess the vulnerability of four\nstate-of-the-art face recognition systems, including FaceNet, VGG-Face,\nArcFace, and ISV.

    "abstract": "Lattice Boltzmann schemes are efficient numerical methods to solve a broad\nrange of problems under the form of conservation laws. However, they suffer\nfrom a chronic lack of clear theoretical foundations. In particular, the\nconsistency analysis is still an open issue. We propose a rigorous derivation\nof the macroscopic equations for any lattice Boltzmann scheme under acoustic\nscaling. This is done by passing from a kinetic (lattice Boltzmann) to a\nmacroscopic (Finite Difference) point of view at a fully discrete level in\norder to eliminate the non-conserved moments relaxing away from the\nequilibrium. We rewrite the lattice Boltzmann scheme as a multi-step Finite\nDifference scheme on the conserved variables, as introduced in our previous\ncontribution. We then perform the usual consistency analysis for Finite\nDifference by exploiting its precise characterization using matrices of Finite\nDifference operators. Though we present the derivation until second-order under\nacoustic scaling, we provide all the elements to extend it to higher orders and\nto other scalings, since the kinetic-macroscopic connection is conducted at the\nfully discrete level.

    "abstract": "Consistency and complementarity are two key ingredients for boosting\nmulti-view clustering (MVC). Recently with the introduction of popular\ncontrastive learning, the consistency learning of views has been further\nenhanced in MVC, leading to promising performance. However, by contrast, the\ncomplementarity has not received sufficient attention except just in the\nfeature facet, where the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) term or\nthe independent encoder-decoder network is usually adopted to capture\nview-specific information. This motivates us to reconsider the complementarity\nlearning of views comprehensively from multiple facets including the feature-,\nview-label- and contrast- facets, while maintaining the view consistency. We\nempirically find that all the facets contribute to the complementarity\nlearning, especially the view-label facet, which is usually neglected by\nexisting methods. Based on this, we develop a novel \\underline{M}ultifacet\n\\underline{C}omplementarity learning framework for\n\\underline{M}ulti-\\underline{V}iew \\underline{C}lustering (MCMVC), which fuses\nmultifacet complementarity information, especially explicitly embedding the\nview-label information.

Direct 4D printing is a\ncompelling method to morph complex 3D shapes out of as-printed 2D plates.\nHowever, most direct 4D printing methods require multi-material systems\ninvolving costly machines.

We survey nearly 200 articles concerning gender bias in NLP to discover\nhow the field conceptualizes gender both explicitly (e.g. through definitions\nof terms) and implicitly (e.g. through how gender is operationalized in\npractice). In order to get a better idea of emerging trajectories of thought,\nwe split these articles into two sections by time.\nWe find that the majority of the articles do not make their theorization of\ngender explicit, even if they clearly define \"bias.\" Almost none use a model of\ngender that is intersectional or inclusive of nonbinary genders; and many\nconflate sex characteristics, social gender, and linguistic gender in ways that\ndisregard the existence and experience of trans, nonbinary, and intersex\npeople.

Based on such a model, we then formulate the HMA-based beam combining\nproblem for the proposed XL-MIMO communications, which is challenging due to\nthe nonlinear coupling of high dimensional HMA weights and baseband combiners.\nWe further present a sum-mean-square-error-minimization-based algorithmic\nframework. Numerical results showcase that the proposed scheme can effectively\nalleviate the sum-rate loss caused by the near-field and dual-wideband effects\nin HMA-assisted XL-MIMO systems. Meanwhile, the proposed HMA-based scheme can\nachieve a higher sum rate than the conventional phase-shifter-based hybrid\nanalog/digital one with the same array aperture.",

    "abstract": "6D object pose estimation is a crucial prerequisite for autonomous robot\nmanipulation applications. The state-of-the-art models for pose estimation are\nconvolutional neural network (CNN)-based. Lately, Transformers, an architecture\noriginally proposed for natural language processing, is achieving\nstate-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks as well. Equipped with\nthe multi-head self-attention mechanism, Transformers enable simple\nsingle-stage end-to-end architectures for learning object detection and 6D\nobject pose estimation jointly. In this work, we propose YOLOPose (short form\nfor You Only Look Once Pose estimation), a Transformer-based multi-object 6D\npose estimation method based on keypoint regression. In contrast to the\nstandard heatmaps for predicting keypoints in an image, we directly regress the\nkeypoints. Additionally, we employ a learnable orientation estimation module to\npredict the orientation from the keypoints. Along with a separate translation\nestimation module, our model is end-to-end differentiable. Our method is\nsuitable for real-time applications and achieves results comparable to\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Sharing short personalized videos to various social media networks has become\nquite popular in recent years. This raises the need for digital retouching of\nportraits in videos. However, applying portrait image editing directly on\nportrait video frames cannot generate smooth and stable video sequences. To\nthis end, we present a robust and easy-to-use parametric method to reshape the\nportrait in a video to produce smooth retouched results. Given an input\nportrait video, our method consists of two main stages: stabilized face\nreconstruction, and continuous video reshaping. In the first stage, we start by\nestimating face rigid pose transformations across video frames. Then we jointly\noptimize multiple frames to reconstruct an accurate face identity, followed by\nrecovering face expressions over the entire video. In the second stage, we\nfirst reshape the reconstructed 3D face using a parametric reshaping model\nreflecting the weight change of the face, and then utilize the reshaped 3D face\nto guide the warping of video frames. We develop a novel signed distance\nfunction based dense mapping method for the warping between face contours\nbefore and after reshaping, resulting in stable warped video frames with\nminimum distortions. In addition, we use the 3D structure of the face to\ncorrect the dense mapping to achieve temporal consistency. We generate the\nfinal result by minimizing the background distortion through optimizing a\ncontent-aware warping mesh. Extensive experiments show that our method is able\nto create visually pleasing results by adjusting a simple reshaping parameter,\nwhich facilitates portrait video editing for social media and visual effects.",

    "abstract": "Real-time in-between motion generation is universally required in games and\nhighly desirable in existing animation pipelines. Its core challenge lies in\nthe need to satisfy three critical conditions simultaneously: quality,\ncontrollability and speed, which renders any methods that need offline\ncomputation (or post-processing) or cannot incorporate (often unpredictable)\nuser control undesirable. To this end, we propose a new real-time transition\nmethod to address the aforementioned challenges. Our approach consists of two\nkey components: motion manifold and conditional transitioning. The former\nlearns the important low-level motion features and their dynamics; while the\nlatter synthesizes transitions conditioned on a target frame and the desired\ntransition duration. We first learn a motion manifold that explicitly models\nthe intrinsic transition stochasticity in human motions via a multi-modal\nmapping mechanism. Then, during generation, we design a transition model which\nis essentially a sampling strategy to sample from the learned manifold, based\non the target frame and the aimed transition duration. We validate our method\non different datasets in tasks where no post-processing or offline computation\nis allowed. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we show that our\nmethod is able to generate high-quality motions measured under multiple\nmetrics. Our method is also robust under various target frames (with extreme\ncases).",

    "abstract": "In this paper we address imbalanced binary classification (IBC) tasks.\nApplying resampling strategies to balance the class distribution of training\ninstances is a common approach to tackle these problems. Many state-of-the-art\nmethods find instances of interest close to the decision boundary to drive the\nresampling process. However, under-sampling the majority class may potentially\nlead to important information loss. Over-sampling also may increase the chance\nof overfitting by propagating the information contained in instances from the\nminority class. The main contribution of our work is a new method called ICLL\nfor tackling IBC tasks which is not based on resampling training observations.\nInstead, ICLL follows a layered learning paradigm to model the data in two\nstages. In the first layer, ICLL learns to distinguish cases close to the\ndecision boundary from cases which are clearly from the majority class, where\nthis dichotomy is defined using a hierarchical clustering analysis. In the\nsubsequent layer, we use instances close to the decision boundary and instances\nfrom the minority class to solve the original predictive task. A second\ncontribution of our work is the automatic definition of the layers which\ncomprise the layered learning strategy using a hierarchical clustering model.\nThis is a relevant discovery as this process is usually performed manually\naccording to domain knowledge.

    "abstract": "Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made prominent\nprogress in recent years. For training efficiency and scalability, most of the\nMARL algorithms make all agents share the same policy or value network.\nHowever, many complex multi-agent tasks require agents with a variety of\nspecific abilities to handle different subtasks. Sharing parameters\nindiscriminately may lead to similar behaviors across all agents, which will\nlimit the exploration efficiency and be detrimental to the final performance.\nTo balance the training complexity and the diversity of agents' behaviors, we\npropose a novel framework for learning dynamic subtask assignment (LDSA) in\ncooperative MARL. Specifically, we first introduce a subtask encoder that\nconstructs a vector representation for each subtask according to its identity.\nTo reasonably assign agents to different subtasks, we propose an ability-based\nsubtask selection strategy, which can dynamically group agents with similar\nabilities into the same subtask. Then, we condition the subtask policy on its\nrepresentation and agents dealing with the same subtask share their experiences\nto train the subtask policy. We further introduce two regularizers to increase\nthe representation difference between subtasks and avoid agents changing\nsubtasks frequently to stabilize training, respectively. Empirical results show\nthat LDSA learns reasonable and effective subtask assignment for better\ncollaboration and significantly improves the learning performance on the\nchallenging StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark.",

Specifically, droplet tracking in dense\nemulsions is challenging as droplets move in tightly packed configurations.\nSometimes the individual droplets in these dense clusters are hard to resolve,\neven for a human observer. Here, two deep learning-based cutting-edge\nalgorithms for object detection (YOLO) and object tracking (DeepSORT) are\ncombined into a single image analysis tool, DropTrack, to track droplets in\nmicrofluidic experiments. DropTrack analyzes input videos, extracts droplets'\ntrajectories, and infers other observables of interest, such as droplet\nnumbers. Training an object detector network for droplet recognition with\nmanually annotated images is a labor-intensive task and a persistent\nbottleneck. This work partly resolves this problem by training object detector\nnetworks (YOLOv5) with hybrid datasets containing real and synthetic images.

For our test case, the YOLO networks trained with 60%\nsynthetic images show similar performance in droplet counting as with the one\ntrained using 100% real images, meanwhile saving the image annotation work by\n60%. DropTrack's performance is measured in terms of mean average precision\n(mAP), mean square error in counting the droplets, and inference speed.

Furthermore, we propose Domain-specific Frequency (DF), a novel\nword-level importance weight that measures the relative importance of a word\nfor a specific corpus compared to other corpora. Based on DF, we propose\nweighted learning, a method that integrates DF to the loss function. We also\nadopt DF as a new evaluation metric. Extensive experiments show that our\nmethods gain significant improvements on both automatic and human evaluation.\nWe share our code and data for reproducibility",

    "abstract": "Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) is among the most challenging problems in\nDistributed Machine Learning (DML). Byzantine failures are still difficult to\ntackle due to their unrestricted nature; as a result, the possibility of\ngenerating arbitrary data. Extensive research efforts are persistently being\nmade to put into effect the BFT in DML. Some recent studies have been\nundertaken to take into consideration various BFT approaches in DML. However,\ncertain aspects seem to be limited, such as the few analyzed approaches and the\nabsence of the techniques classification employed in the studied approaches. In\nthis paper, we present a survey of recent works surrounding BFT in DML. Mainly\nin first-order optimization methods, especially Stochastic Gradient Descent\n(SGD). We highlight the key techniques as well as fundamental approaches. We\noffer an illustrative description of techniques used in BFT in DML, with a\nproposed classification of BFTs approaches in the context of their basic\ntechniques. This classification is established on specific criteria such as\ncommunication process, optimization method, and topology setting, which\ncharacterize future work methods examining the current challenges of BFT in DML",

    "abstract": "Iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) is essential to secure iris\nrecognition systems. Recent iris PAD solutions achieved good performance by\nleveraging deep learning techniques. However, most results were reported under\nintra-database scenarios and it is unclear if such solutions can generalize\nwell across databases and capture spectra. These PAD methods run the risk of\noverfitting because of the binary label supervision during the network\ntraining, which serves global information learning but weakens the capture of\nlocal discriminative features. This chapter presents a novel attention-based\ndeep pixel-wise binary supervision (A-PBS) method. A-PBS utilizes pixel-wise\nsupervision to capture the fine-grained pixel/patch-level cues and attention\nmechanism to guide the network to automatically find regions where most\ncontribute to an accurate PAD decision. Extensive experiments are performed on\nsix NIR and one visible-light iris databases to show the effectiveness and\nrobustness of proposed A-PBS methods. We additionally conduct extensive\nexperiments under intra-/cross-database and intra-/cross-spectrum for detailed\nanalysis. The results of our experiments indicates the generalizability of the\nA-PBS iris PAD approach.",

    "abstract": "A high-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) matrix frequently appears in various\nbig-data-related applications, which demonstrates the inherently non-negative\ninteractions among numerous nodes. A non-negative latent factor (NLF) model\nperforms efficient representation learning to an HDI matrix, whose learning\nprocess mostly relies on a single latent factor-dependent, non-negative and\nmultiplicative update (SLF-NMU) algorithm. However, an SLF-NMU algorithm\nupdates a latent factor based on the current update increment only without\nappropriate considerations of past learning information, resulting in slow\nconvergence. Inspired by the prominent success of a proportional-integral (PI)\ncontroller in various applications, this paper proposes a\nProportional-Integral-incorporated Non-negative Latent Factor (PI-NLF) model\nwith two-fold ideas: a) establishing an Increment Refinement (IR) mechanism via\nconsidering the past update increments following the principle of a PI\ncontroller; and b) designing an IR-based SLF-NMU (ISN) algorithm to accelerate\nthe convergence rate of a resultant model. Empirical studies on four HDI\ndatasets demonstrate that a PI-NLF model outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmodels in both computational efficiency and estimation accuracy for missing\ndata of an HDI matrix. Hence, this study unveils the feasibility of boosting\nthe performance of a non-negative learning algorithm through an error feedback\ncontroller.",

    "title": "Holistic Approach to Measure Sample-level Adversarial Vulnerability and  its Utility in Building Trustworthy Systems",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attack perturbs an image with an imperceptible noise, leading to\nincorrect model prediction. Recently, a few works showed inherent bias\nassociated with such attack (robustness bias), where certain subgroups in a\ndataset (e.g. based on class, gender, etc.) are less robust than others. This\nbias not only persists even after adversarial training, but often results in\nsevere performance discrepancies across these subgroups. Existing works\ncharacterize the subgroup's robustness bias by only checking individual\nsample's proximity to the decision boundary. In this work, we argue that this\nmeasure alone is not sufficient and validate our argument via extensive\nexperimental analysis. It has been observed that adversarial attacks often\ncorrupt the high-frequency components of the input image. We, therefore,\npropose a holistic approach for quantifying adversarial vulnerability of a\nsample by combining these different perspectives, i.e., degree of model's\nreliance on high-frequency features and the (conventional) sample-distance to\nthe decision boundary. We demonstrate that by reliably estimating adversarial\nvulnerability at the sample level using the proposed holistic metric, it is\npossible to develop a trustworthy system where humans can be alerted about the\nincoming samples that are highly likely to be misclassified at test time. This\nis achieved with better precision when our holistic metric is used over\nindividual measures. To further corroborate the utility of the proposed\nholistic approach, we perform knowledge distillation in a limited-sample\nsetting. We observe that the student network trained with the subset of samples\nselected using our combined metric performs better than both the competing\nbaselines, viz., where samples are selected randomly or based on their\ndistances to the decision boundary.",

A circuit permits the\ninstantaneous transmission of signals between the connected amoebots. In this\npaper, we examine the structural power of the reconfigurable circuits.\nWe start with some fundamental problems like the stripe computation problem\nwhere, given any connected amoebot structure $S$, an amoebot $u$ in $S$, and\nsome axis $X$, all amoebots belonging to axis $X$ through $u$ have to be\nidentified. Second, we consider the global maximum problem, which identifies an\namoebot at the highest possible position with respect to some direction in some\ngiven amoebot (sub)structure. A solution to this problem can then be used to\nsolve the skeleton problem, where a (not necessarily simple) cycle of amoebots\nhas to be found in the given amoebot structure which contains all boundary\namoebots. A canonical solution to that problem can then be used to come up with\na canonical path, which provides a unique characterization of the shape of the\ngiven amoebot structure. Constructing canonical paths for different directions\nwill then allow the amoebots to set up a spanning tree and to check symmetry\nproperties of the given amoebot structure.\nThe problems are important for a number of applications like rapid shape\ntransformation, energy dissemination, and structural monitoring. Interestingly,\nthe reconfigurable circuit extension allows polylogarithmic-time solutions to\nall of these problems.",

Contrary to global hierarchy, local hierarchy as the structured\ntarget labels hierarchy corresponding to each text sample is dynamic and\nrelevant to text samples, which is ignored in previous methods. To exploit\nglobal and local hierarchies, we propose Hierarchy-guided BERT with Global and\nLocal hierarchies (HBGL), which utilizes the large-scale parameters and prior\nlanguage knowledge of BERT to model both global and local hierarchies.\nMoreover, HBGL avoids the intentional fusion of semantic and hierarchical\nmodules by directly modeling semantic and hierarchical information with BERT.\nCompared with the state-of-the-art method HGCLR, our method achieves\nsignificant improvement on three benchmark datasets.",

    "title": "Heterogeneous Semantic and Bit Communications: A Semi-NOMA Scheme",
    "abstract": "Multiple access (MA) design is investigated for facilitating the coexistence\nof the emerging semantic transmission and the conventional bit-based\ntransmission in future networks. The semantic rate is considered for measuring\nthe performance of the semantic transmission. However, a key challenge is that\nthere is a lack of a closed-form expression for a key parameter, namely the\nsemantic similarity, which characterizes the sentence similarity between an\noriginal sentence and the corresponding recovered sentence. To overcome this\nchallenge, we propose a data regression method, where the semantic similarity\nis approximated by a generalized logistic function. Using the obtained\ntractable function, we propose a heterogeneous semantic and bit communication\nframework, where an access point simultaneously sends the semantic and bit\nstreams to one semantics-interested user (S-user) and one bit-interested user\n(B-user). To realize this heterogeneous semantic and bit transmission in\nmulti-user networks, three MA schemes are proposed, namely orthogonal multiple\naccess (OMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and semi-NOMA. More\nspecifically, the bit stream in semi-NOMA is split into two streams, one is\ntransmitted with the semantic stream over the shared frequency sub-band and the\nother is transmitted over the separate orthogonal frequency sub-band. To study\nthe fundamental performance limits of the three proposed MA schemes, the\nsemantic-versus-bit (SvB) rate region and the power region are defined. An\noptimal resource allocation procedure is then derived for characterizing the\nboundary of the SvB rate region and the power region achieved by each MA\nscheme. The structures of the derived solutions demonstrate that semi-NOMA is\nsuperior to both NOMA and OMA given its highly flexible transmission policy.\nOur numerical results validate the analysis and show the superiority of\nsemi-NOMA.",

    "abstract": "The development of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is progressing quickly and the\nfirst robotaxi services are being deployed worldwide. However, to receive\nauthority certification for mass deployment, manufactures need to justify that\ntheir AVs operate safer than human drivers. This in turn creates the need to\nestimate and model the collision rate (failure rate) of an AV taking all\npossible errors and driving situations into account. In other words, there is\nthe strong demand for comprehensive Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) models for\nAVs. In this paper, we will introduce such a generic and scalable model that\ncreates a link between errors in the perception system to vehicle-level\nfailures (collisions). Using this model, we are able to derive requirements for\nthe perception quality based on the desired vehicle-level MTBF or vice versa to\nobtain an MTBF value given a certain mission profile and perception quality.",

GANimator generates motions that\nresemble the core elements of the original motion, while simultaneously\nsynthesizing novel and diverse movements.

By contrast, GANimator only requires training on a\nsingle motion sequence, enabling novel motion synthesis for a variety of\nskeletal structures e.g., bipeds, quadropeds, hexapeds, and more. Our framework\ncontains a series of generative and adversarial neural networks, each\nresponsible for generating motions in a specific frame rate. The framework\nprogressively learns to synthesize motion from random noise, enabling\nhierarchical control over the generated motion content across varying levels of\ndetail. We show a number of applications, including crowd simulation, key-frame\nediting, style transfer, and interactive control, which all learn from a single\ninput sequence.

While they are designed for text-prompted\ngeneration, it remains an open question how the generation process could be\nguided by modalities beyond text such as images. In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free framework, called MAGIC (iMAge-Guided text generatIon with CLIP),\nfor plugging in visual controls in the generation process and enabling LMs to\nperform multimodal tasks (e.g., image captioning) in a zero-shot manner. MAGIC\nis a simple yet efficient plug-and-play framework, which directly combines an\noff-the-shelf LM (i.e., GPT-2) and an image-text matching model (i.e., CLIP)\nfor image-grounded text generation. During decoding, MAGIC influences the\ngeneration of the LM by introducing a CLIP-induced score, called magic score,\nwhich regularizes the generated result to be semantically related to a given\nimage while being coherent to the previously generated context. Notably, the\nproposed decoding scheme does not involve any gradient update operation,\ntherefore being computationally efficient. On the challenging task of zero-shot\nimage captioning, MAGIC outperforms the state-of-the-art method by notable\nmargins with a nearly 27 times decoding speedup.

However, there are no\nreliable methods available yet to solve the issue of automatically detecting\ntext on technical drawings. The unreliable detection of the contents on\ntechnical drawings using classical detection and object character recognition\n(OCR) tools is mainly due to the limited number of technical drawings and the\ncaptcha-like structure of the contents.

    "title": "What is Right for Me is Not Yet Right for You: A Dataset for Grounding  Relative Directions via Multi-Task Learning",
    "abstract": "Understanding spatial relations is essential for intelligent agents to act\nand communicate in the physical world. Relative directions are spatial\nrelations that describe the relative positions of target objects with regard to\nthe intrinsic orientation of reference objects. Grounding relative directions\nis more difficult than grounding absolute directions because it not only\nrequires a model to detect objects in the image and to identify spatial\nrelation based on this information, but it also needs to recognize the\norientation of objects and integrate this information into the reasoning\nprocess. We investigate the challenging problem of grounding relative\ndirections with end-to-end neural networks. To this end, we provide GRiD-3D, a\nnovel dataset that features relative directions and complements existing visual\nquestion answering (VQA) datasets, such as CLEVR, that involve only absolute\ndirections. We also provide baselines for the dataset with two established\nend-to-end VQA models. Experimental evaluations show that answering questions\non relative directions is feasible when questions in the dataset simulate the\nnecessary subtasks for grounding relative directions. We discover that those\nsubtasks are learned in an order that reflects the steps of an intuitive\npipeline for processing relative directions.",

In this paper, we\nintroduce a spectral efficiency optimization approach in vehicular OCC.\nSpecifically, we aim at optimally adapting the modulation order and the\nrelative speed while respecting bit error rate and latency constraints. As the\noptimization problem is NP-hard problem, we model the optimization problem as a\nMarkov decision process (MDP) to enable the use of solutions that can be\napplied online. We then relaxed the constrained problem by employing Lagrange\nrelaxation approach before solving it by multi-agent deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL).

To this end, we disentangle the embedding space into two representations.\nThe first of which is correlated with the sensitive attribute while the second\nis not. We apply our local fairness objective only to the second, uncorrelated,\nrepresentation.

The outcomes of\nQ-learning processes show that learning locomotion (with the displacement as\nreward) is significantly easier than learning chemotaxis (with the increase of\nsolute flux as reward). The chemotaxis problem, even at low Pe, has a varying\nenvironment that renders learning more difficult. Further, the learning\ndifficulty increases severely with the P\\'eclet number.

However, as in\nmost analogous seismic models, the peculiar statistics of the corresponding\ntime-series severely jeopardize this endeavour, due to the time intermittence\nand scale-invariance of these events. But more importantly, such predictions\nare hard to {\\it assess}: depending on the choice of what to predict, the\nresults can be very different and not easily compared. Furthermore, forecasting\nmodels may be trained with various generic metrics which ignore some important\nspecificities of the problem at hand, in our case seismic risk. Finally, these\nmodels often do not provide a clear strategy regarding the best way to use\nthese predictions in practice. Here we introduce a framework that allows to\ndesign, evaluate and compare not only predictors but also decision-making\npolicies: a model seismically active {\\it city} subjected to the crackling\ndynamics observed in the mechanical response of knitted fabric. We thus proceed\nto study the population of KnitCity, introducing a policy through which the\nmayor of the town can decide to either keep people in, which in case of large\nevents cause human loss, or evacuate the city, which costs a daily fee. The\npolicy only relies on past seismic observations. We construct efficient\npolicies using a reinforcement learning environment and various time-series\npredictors based on artificial neural networks.

One potential\nreason for this unexpected result is that all losses let the network focus on\nsimilar image regions or properties. In this paper, we investigate this by\nconducting a two-step analysis to extract and compare the learned visual\nfeatures of the same model architecture trained with different loss functions:\nFirst, we compare the learned features on the pixel level by correlating\nsaliency maps of the same input images. Second, we compare the clustering of\nembeddings for several image properties, e.g. object color or illumination. To\nprovide independent control over these properties, photo-realistic 3D car\nrenders similar to images in the Cars196 dataset are generated. In our\nanalysis, we compare 14 pretrained models from a recent study and find that,\neven though all models perform similarly, different loss functions can guide\nthe model to learn different features. We especially find differences between\nclassification and ranking based losses. Our analysis also shows that some\nseemingly irrelevant properties can have significant influence on the resulting\nembedding.

    "title": "Hybrid CNN Based Attention with Category Prior for User Image Behavior  Modeling",
    "abstract": "User historical behaviors are proved useful for Click Through Rate (CTR)\nprediction in online advertising system. In Meituan, one of the largest\ne-commerce platform in China, an item is typically displayed with its image and\nwhether a user clicks the item or not is usually influenced by its image, which\nimplies that user's image behaviors are helpful for understanding user's visual\npreference and improving the accuracy of CTR prediction. Existing user image\nbehavior models typically use a two-stage architecture, which extracts visual\nembeddings of images through off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nin the first stage, and then jointly trains a CTR model with those visual\nembeddings and non-visual features. We find that the two-stage architecture is\nsub-optimal for CTR prediction. Meanwhile, precisely labeled categories in\nonline ad systems contain abundant visual prior information, which can enhance\nthe modeling of user image behaviors. However, off-the-shelf CNNs without\ncategory prior may extract category unrelated features, limiting CNN's\nexpression ability. To address the two issues, we propose a hybrid CNN based\nattention module, unifying user's image behaviors and category prior, for CTR\nprediction. Our approach achieves significant improvements in both online and\noffline experiments on a billion scale real serving dataset.",

    "abstract": "We, as human beings, can understand and picture a familiar scene from\narbitrary viewpoints given a single image, whereas this is still a grand\nchallenge for computers. We hereby present a novel solution to mimic such human\nperception capability based on a new paradigm of amodal 3D scene understanding\nwith neural rendering for a closed scene. Specifically, we first learn the\nprior knowledge of the objects in a closed scene via an offline stage, which\nfacilitates an online stage to understand the room with unseen furniture\narrangement. During the online stage, given a panoramic image of the scene in\ndifferent layouts, we utilize a holistic neural-rendering-based optimization\nframework to efficiently estimate the correct 3D scene layout and deliver\nrealistic free-viewpoint rendering. In order to handle the domain gap between\nthe offline and online stage, our method exploits compositional neural\nrendering techniques for data augmentation in the offline training. The\nexperiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our two-stage\ndesign achieves robust 3D scene understanding and outperforms competing methods\nby a large margin, and we also show that our realistic free-viewpoint rendering\nenables various applications, including scene touring and editing.

In this paper, we do not aim to introduce any novel technique for TAD.\nInstead, we study a simple, straightforward, yet must-known baseline given the\ncurrent status of complex design and low efficiency in TAD. In our simple\nbaseline (BasicTAD), we decompose the TAD pipeline into several essential\ncomponents: data sampling, backbone design, neck construction, and detection\nhead. We empirically investigate the existing techniques in each component for\nthis baseline and, more importantly, perform end-to-end training over the\nentire pipeline thanks to the simplicity in design. Our BasicTAD yields an\nastounding RGB-Only baseline very close to the state-of-the-art methods with\ntwo-stream inputs. In addition, we further improve the BasicTAD by preserving\nmore temporal and spatial information in network representation (termed as\nBasicTAD Plus). Empirical results demonstrate that our BasicTAD Plus is very\nefficient and significantly outperforms the previous methods on the datasets of\nTHUMOS14 and FineAction.

The\nplanner maintains a set of desirable outcomes for each realization of the\nuncertain parameter and seeks to maximize the probability that agents choose an\nacceptable outcome for the true parameter. We distinguish between stateless and\nstateful objectives. In the former, the set of desirable outcomes does not\nchange as a function of the risk parameter, whereas in the latter it does. For\nstateless objectives, we reduce the problem to maximizing the probability of\ninducing mean beliefs that lie in intervals computable from the set of\ndesirable outcomes.

    "abstract": "Standpoint logic is a recently proposed formalism in the context of knowledge\nintegration, which advocates a multi-perspective approach permitting reasoning\nwith a selection of diverse and possibly conflicting standpoints rather than\nforcing their unification. In this paper, we introduce nested sequent calculi\nfor propositional standpoint logics--proof systems that manipulate trees whose\nnodes are multisets of formulae--and show how to automate standpoint reasoning\nby means of non-deterministic proof-search algorithms. To obtain worst-case\ncomplexity-optimal proof-search, we introduce a novel technique in the context\nof nested sequents, referred to as \"coloring,\" which consists of taking a\nformula as input, guessing a certain coloring of its subformulae, and then\nrunning proof-search in a nested sequent calculus on the colored input. Our\ntechnique lets us decide the validity of standpoint formulae in CoNP since\nproof-search only produces a partial proof relative to each permitted coloring\nof the input. We show how all partial proofs can be fused together to construct\na complete proof when the input is valid, and how certain partial proofs can be\ntransformed into a counter-model when the input is invalid. These\n\"certificates\" (i.e. proofs and counter-models) serve as explanations of the\n(in)validity of the input.",

We analyzed\npublicly accessible reviews of several Bangladeshi telemedicine apps (N = 14)\nto evaluate the user impressions. Additionally, to ascertain the public opinion\nof these apps, we performed a survey in which the patients (N = 87)\nparticipated willingly. Our analysis of the collected opinions reveals what\nusers experience, what they appreciate, and what they are concerned about when\nthey use telemedicine apps. Additionally, our study demonstrates what users\nexpect from telemedicine apps, independent of their past experience. Finally,\nwe explore how to address the issues we discovered and how telemedicine may be\nused to effectively offer healthcare services throughout the country.

Therefore, automation through machine\nlearning (ML) classification is being increasingly proposed which would allow\nML models to learn the features of a heartbeat and detect abnormalities. The\nlack of interpretability hinders the application of Deep Learning in\nhealthcare. Through interpretability of these models, we would understand how a\nmachine learning algorithm makes its decisions and what patterns are being\nfollowed for classification. This thesis builds Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifiers based on state-of-the-art\nmodels and compares their performance and interpretability to shallow\nclassifiers. Here, both global and local interpretability methods are exploited\nto understand the interaction between dependent and independent variables\nacross the entire dataset and to examine model decisions in each sample,\nrespectively. Partial Dependence Plots, Shapley Additive Explanations,\nPermutation Feature Importance, and Gradient Weighted Class Activation Maps\n(Grad-Cam) are the four interpretability techniques implemented on time-series\nML models classifying ECG rhythms. In particular, we exploit Grad-Cam, which is\na local interpretability technique and examine whether its interpretability\nvaries between correctly and incorrectly classified ECG beats within each\nclass. Furthermore, the classifiers are evaluated using K-Fold cross-validation\nand Leave Groups Out techniques, and we use non-parametric statistical testing\nto examine whether differences are significant. It was found that Grad-CAM was\nthe most effective interpretability technique at explaining predictions of\nproposed CNN and LSTM models.

Our method encodes the volumetric field\nof a 3D shape with an adaptive feature volume organized by an octree and\napplies a compact multilayer perceptron network for mapping the features to the\nfield value at each 3D position. An encoder-decoder network is designed to\nlearn the adaptive feature volume based on the graph convolutions over the dual\ngraph of octree nodes. The core of our network is a new graph convolution\noperator defined over a regular grid of features fused from irregular\nneighboring octree nodes at different levels, which not only reduces the\ncomputational and memory cost of the convolutions over irregular neighboring\noctree nodes, but also improves the performance of feature learning. Our method\neffectively encodes shape details, enables fast 3D shape reconstruction, and\nexhibits good generality for modeling 3D shapes out of training categories. We\nevaluate our method on a set of reconstruction tasks of 3D shapes and scenes\nand validate its superiority over other existing approaches.

    "abstract": "In car-body production the pre-formed sheet metal parts of the body are\nassembled on fully-automated production lines. The body passes through multiple\nstations in succession, and is processed according to the order requirements.\nThe timely completion of orders depends on the individual station-based\noperations concluding within their scheduled cycle times. If an error occurs in\none station, it can have a knock-on effect, resulting in delays on the\ndownstream stations. To the best of our knowledge, there exist no methods for\nautomatically distinguishing between source and knock-on errors in this\nsetting, as well as establishing a causal relation between them. Utilizing\nreal-time information about conditions collected by a production data\nacquisition system, we propose a novel vehicle manufacturing analysis system,\nwhich uses deep learning to establish a link between source and knock-on\nerrors. We benchmark three sequence-to-sequence models, and introduce a novel\ncomposite time-weighted action metric for evaluating models in this context. We\nevaluate our framework on a real-world car production dataset recorded by\nVolkswagen Commercial Vehicles. Surprisingly we find that 71.68% of sequences\ncontain either a source or knock-on error.

To reproduce such\ninteractions in virtual spaces (e.g., metaverse), we need to be able to capture\nand model them, including changes in the scene geometry, ideally from\nego-centric input alone (head camera and body-worn inertial sensors). This is\nan extremely hard problem, especially since the object/scene might not be\nvisible from the head camera (e.g., a human not looking at a chair while\nsitting down, or not looking at the door handle while opening a door). In this\npaper, we present HOPS, the first method to capture interactions such as\ndragging objects and opening doors from ego-centric data alone. Central to our\nmethod is reasoning about human-object interactions, allowing to track objects\neven when they are not visible from the head camera. HOPS localizes and\nregisters both the human and the dynamic object in a pre-scanned static scene.\nHOPS is an important first step towards advanced AR/VR applications based on\nimmersive virtual universes, and can provide human-centric training data to\nteach machines to interact with their surroundings.

Inspired by this, we\npropose FixIt, a dataset that contains about 5k poorly-designed 3D physical\nobjects paired with choices to fix them. To mimic humans' mental simulation\nprocess, we present FixNet, a novel framework that seamlessly incorporates\nperception and physical dynamics.

    "abstract": "Differentiable physics has recently been shown as a powerful tool for solving\nsoft-body manipulation tasks. However, the differentiable physics solver often\ngets stuck when the initial contact points of the end effectors are sub-optimal\nor when performing multi-stage tasks that require contact point switching,\nwhich often leads to local minima. To address this challenge, we propose a\ncontact point discovery approach (CPDeform) that guides the stand-alone\ndifferentiable physics solver to deform various soft-body plasticines. The key\nidea of our approach is to integrate optimal transport-based contact points\ndiscovery into the differentiable physics solver to overcome the local minima\nfrom initial contact points or contact switching. On single-stage tasks, our\nmethod can automatically find suitable initial contact points based on\ntransport priorities. On complex multi-stage tasks, we can iteratively switch\nthe contact points of end-effectors based on transport priorities. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of our method, we introduce PlasticineLab-M that extends the\nexisting differentiable physics benchmark PlasticineLab to seven new\nchallenging multi-stage soft-body manipulation tasks. Extensive experimental\nresults suggest that: 1) on multi-stage tasks that are infeasible for the\nvanilla differentiable physics solver, our approach discovers contact points\nthat efficiently guide the solver to completion; 2) on tasks where the vanilla\nsolver performs sub-optimally or near-optimally, our contact point discovery\nmethod performs better than or on par with the manipulation performance\nobtained with handcrafted contact points.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing 3D indoor scenes from\nmulti-view images. Many previous works have shown impressive reconstruction\nresults on textured objects, but they still have difficulty in handling\nlow-textured planar regions, which are common in indoor scenes. An approach to\nsolving this issue is to incorporate planer constraints into the depth map\nestimation in multi-view stereo-based methods, but the per-view plane\nestimation and depth optimization lack both efficiency and multi-view\nconsistency. In this work, we show that the planar constraints can be\nconveniently integrated into the recent implicit neural representation-based\nreconstruction methods. Specifically, we use an MLP network to represent the\nsigned distance function as the scene geometry. Based on the Manhattan-world\nassumption, planar constraints are employed to regularize the geometry in floor\nand wall regions predicted by a 2D semantic segmentation network. To resolve\nthe inaccurate segmentation, we encode the semantics of 3D points with another\nMLP and design a novel loss that jointly optimizes the scene geometry and\nsemantics in 3D space. Experiments on ScanNet and 7-Scenes datasets show that\nthe proposed method outperforms previous methods by a large margin on 3D\nreconstruction quality.

Due to the\nspatial uniformity of blobs and the locality inherent to convolution, our\nnetwork learns to associate different blobs with different entities in a scene\nand to arrange these blobs to capture scene layout.

As such, it is fundamental to develop schemes that\nencode as much information as available about the problem at hand.

    "title": "Safe Bayesian Optimization using Interior-Point Methods -- Applied to  Personalized Insulin Dose Guidance",
    "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of Bayesian optimization for systems with\nsafety-critical constraints, where both the objective function and the\nconstraints are unknown, but can be observed by querying the system. In\nsafety-critical applications, querying the system at an infeasible point can\nhave catastrophic consequences. Such systems require a safe learning framework,\nsuch that the performance objective can be optimized while satisfying the\nsafety-critical constraints with high probability. In this paper we propose a\nsafe Bayesian optimization framework that ensures that the points queried are\nalways in the interior of the partially revealed safe region, thereby\nguaranteeing constraint satisfaction with high probability. The proposed\ninterior-point Bayesian optimization framework can be used with any acquisition\nfunction, making it broadly applicable. The performance of the proposed method\nis demonstrated using a personalized insulin dosing application for patients\nwith type 1 diabetes.",

    "title": "Second-Order Sensitivity Analysis for Bilevel Optimization",
    "abstract": "In this work we derive a second-order approach to bilevel optimization, a\ntype of mathematical programming in which the solution to a parameterized\noptimization problem (the \"lower\" problem) is itself to be optimized (in the\n\"upper\" problem) as a function of the parameters. Many existing approaches to\nbilevel optimization employ first-order sensitivity analysis, based on the\nimplicit function theorem (IFT), for the lower problem to derive a gradient of\nthe lower problem solution with respect to its parameters; this IFT gradient is\nthen used in a first-order optimization method for the upper problem. This\npaper extends this sensitivity analysis to provide second-order derivative\ninformation of the lower problem (which we call the IFT Hessian), enabling the\nusage of faster-converging second-order optimization methods at the upper\nlevel. Our analysis shows that (i) much of the computation already used to\nproduce the IFT gradient can be reused for the IFT Hessian, (ii) errors bounds\nderived for the IFT gradient readily apply to the IFT Hessian, (iii) computing\nIFT Hessians can significantly reduce overall computation by extracting more\ninformation from each lower level solve. We corroborate our findings and\ndemonstrate the broad range of applications of our method by applying it to\nproblem instances of least squares hyperparameter auto-tuning, multi-class SVM\nauto-tuning, and inverse optimal control.",

In this paper, we use this \"soft\" or\nanalog information without the conventional discretization step to benefit the\niterative decoders for decoding quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes.\nSyndrome-based iterative belief propagation decoders are modified to utilize\nthe syndrome-soft information to successfully correct both data and syndrome\nerrors simultaneously, without repeated measurements. We demonstrate the\nadvantages of extracting the soft information from the syndrome in our improved\ndecoders, not only in terms of comparison of thresholds and logical error rates\nfor quasi-cyclic lifted-product QLDPC code families, but also for faster\nconvergence of iterative decoders.

The framework\nproposed in this paper can help transportation agencies incorporate resilience\nconsiderations into planning and project development proactively and to\nunderstand the resilience performance of the current road networks effectively.\nThis study identified and implemented four quantitative metrics to classify the\ncriticality of road segments based on critical dimensions of the resilience of\nroad networks, and two integrated metrics were proposed to combine all metrics\nto show the overall performance of road segments in terms of resilience. A case\nstudy was conducted on the Texas road networks to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof implementing this framework in a practical scenario. Since the data used in\nthis study is available to other states and countries, the framework presented\nin this study can be adopted by other transportation agencies across the globe\nfor regional transportation resilience assessments.",

    "title": "Tournaments, Johnson Graphs, and NC-Teaching",
    "abstract": "Quite recently a teaching model, called \"No-Clash Teaching\" or simply\n\"NC-Teaching\", had been suggested that is provably optimal in the following\nstrong sense. First, it satisfies Goldman and Matthias' collusion-freeness\ncondition. Second, the NC-teaching dimension (= NCTD) is smaller than or equal\nto the teaching dimension with respect to any other collusion-free teaching\nmodel. It has also been shown that any concept class which has NC-teaching\ndimension $d$ and is defined over a domain of size $n$ can have at most $2^d\n\\binom{n}{d}$ concepts. The main results in this paper are as follows. First,\nwe characterize the maximum concept classes of NC-teaching dimension $1$ as\nclasses which are induced by tournaments (= complete oriented graphs) in a very\nnatural way. Second, we show that there exists a family $(\\cC_n)_{n\\ge1}$ of\nconcept classes such that the well known recursive teaching dimension (= RTD)\nof $\\cC_n$ grows logarithmically in $n = |\\cC_n|$ while, for every $n\\ge1$, the\nNC-teaching dimension of $\\cC_n$ equals $1$. Since the recursive teaching\ndimension of a finite concept class $\\cC$ is generally bounded $\\log|\\cC|$, the\nfamily $(\\cC_n)_{n\\ge1}$ separates RTD from NCTD in the most striking way. The\nproof of existence of the family $(\\cC_n)_{n\\ge1}$ makes use of the\nprobabilistic method and random tournaments. Third, we improve the\nafore-mentioned upper bound $2^d\\binom{n}{d}$ by a factor of order $\\sqrt{d}$.\nThe verification of the superior bound makes use of Johnson graphs and maximum\nsubgraphs not containing large narrow cliques.",

    "title": "Quantum Extremal Learning",
    "abstract": "We propose a quantum algorithm for `extremal learning', which is the process\nof finding the input to a hidden function that extremizes the function output,\nwithout having direct access to the hidden function, given only partial\ninput-output (training) data. The algorithm, called quantum extremal learning\n(QEL), consists of a parametric quantum circuit that is variationally trained\nto model data input-output relationships and where a trainable quantum feature\nmap, that encodes the input data, is analytically differentiated in order to\nfind the coordinate that extremizes the model. This enables the combination of\nestablished quantum machine learning modelling with established quantum\noptimization, on a single circuit/quantum computer. We have tested our\nalgorithm on a range of classical datasets based on either discrete or\ncontinuous input variables, both of which are compatible with the algorithm. In\ncase of discrete variables, we test our algorithm on synthetic problems\nformulated based on Max-Cut problem generators and also considering higher\norder correlations in the input-output relationships. In case of the continuous\nvariables, we test our algorithm on synthetic datasets in 1D and simple\nordinary differential functions. We find that the algorithm is able to\nsuccessfully find the extremal value of such problems, even when the training\ndataset is sparse or a small fraction of the input configuration space. We\nadditionally show how the algorithm can be used for much more general cases of\nhigher dimensionality, complex differential equations, and with full\nflexibility in the choice of both modeling and optimization ansatz. We envision\nthat due to its general framework and simple construction, the QEL algorithm\nwill be able to solve a wide variety of applications in different fields,\nopening up areas of further research.",

    "abstract": "Over the previous few years, the millimetre wave frequency range and sub-THz\nrange have been received a lot of attention as they include unused frequency\nspectrum resources that are appropriate for providing a lot of applications\nsuch as automotive radars, short communication, medical imaging, security, and\n5G communications to provide end-user access to Multi-Gbit/s services. On the\nother hand and because of the restrictions on the communication systems in\nthese ranges such as power, path losses, and attenuation, the present RF\nantennas can't be used for millimeter and THz applications. The needed antennas\nshould have low-profile, high-gain, acceptable technology, high efficiency and\nlow cost to compensate for these ranges restrictions. Although there are some\nantenna designs for millimeter and sub THz ranges through the last decay, the\nantenna designs in these ranges still under investigation and studies to\ncomplete the vision of the proposed designs for the aforementioned\napplications. Thus, they cannot be carried by the optimum response and\nefficiency for these applications. This thesis aims to introduce a\ncomprehensive study of the main applications that occupy these ranges of\nfrequencies. In addition to introducing efficient antennas for each application\nwith acceptable technology for it.",
