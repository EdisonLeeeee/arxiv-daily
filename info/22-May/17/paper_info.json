    "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning in mmW-NOMA: Joint Power Allocation and  Hybrid Beamforming",
    "abstract": "High demand of data rate in the next generation of wireless communication\ncould be ensured by Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) approach in the\nmillimetre-wave (mmW) frequency band. Decreasing the interference on the other\nusers while maintaining the bit rate via joint power allocation and beamforming\nis mandatory to guarantee the high demand of bit-rate. Furthermore, mmW\nfrequency bands dictates the hybrid structure for beamforming because of the\ntrade-off in implementation and performance, simultaneously. In this paper,\njoint power allocation and hybrid beamforming of mmW-NOMA systems is brought up\nvia recent advances in machine learning and control theory approaches called\nDeep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Actor-critic phenomena is exploited to\nmeasure the immediate reward and providing the new action to maximize the\noverall Q-value of the network. Additionally, to improve the stability of the\napproach, we have utilized Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) approach where overall\nreward and action entropy is maximized, simultaneously. The immediate reward\nhas been defined based on the soft weighted summation of the rate of all the\nusers. The soft weighting is based on the achieved rate and allocated power of\neach user. Furthermore, the channel responses between the users and base\nstation (BS) is defined as the state of environment, while action space is\ninvolved of the digital and analog beamforming weights and allocated power to\neach user. The simulation results represent the superiority of the proposed\napproach rather than the Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and Non-Line of\nSight (NLOS)-NOMA in terms of sum-rate of the users. It's outperformance is\ncaused by the joint optimization and independency of the proposed approach to\nthe channel responses.",

    "abstract": "Modeling crack initiation and propagation in brittle materials is of great\nimportance to be able to predict sudden loss of load-carrying capacity and\nprevent catastrophic failure under severe dynamic loading conditions.\nSecond-order phase-field fracture models have gained wide adoption given their\nability to capture the formation of complex fracture patterns, e.g. via crack\nmerging and branching, and their suitability for implementation within the\ncontext of the conventional finite element method. Higher-order phase-field\nmodels have also been proposed to increase the regularity of the exact solution\nand thus increase the spatial convergence rate of its numerical approximation.\nHowever, they require special numerical techniques to enforce the necessary\ncontinuity of the phase field solution. In this paper, we derive a fourth-order\nphase-field model of fracture in two independent ways; namely, from Hamilton's\nprinciple and from a higher-order micromechanics-based approach. The latter\napproach is novel, and provides a physical interpretation of the higher-order\nterms in the model. In addition, we propose a continuous/discontinuous Galerkin\n(C/DG) method for use in computing the approximate phase-field solution. This\nmethod employs Lagrange polynomial shape functions to guarantee\n$C^0$-continuity of the solution at inter-element boundaries, and enforces the\nrequired $C^1$ regularity with the aid of additional variational and interior\npenalty terms in the weak form. The phase-field equation is coupled with the\nmomentum balance equation to model dynamic fracture problems in hyper-elastic\nmaterials. Two benchmark problems are presented to compare the numerical\nbehavior of the C/DG method with mixed finite element methods.",

    "abstract": "We present the first publicly available Android framework to stream data from\nan event camera directly to a mobile phone. Today's mobile devices handle a\nwider range of workloads than ever before and they incorporate a growing gamut\nof sensors that make devices smarter, more user friendly and secure.\nConventional cameras in particular play a central role in such tasks, but they\ncannot record continuously, as the amount of redundant information recorded is\ncostly to process. Bio-inspired event cameras on the other hand only record\nchanges in a visual scene and have shown promising low-power applications that\nspecifically suit mobile tasks such as face detection, gesture recognition or\ngaze tracking. Our prototype device is the first step towards embedding such an\nevent camera into a battery-powered handheld device. The mobile framework\nallows us to stream events in real-time and opens up the possibilities for\nalways-on and on-demand sensing on mobile phones. To liaise the asynchronous\nevent camera output with synchronous von Neumann hardware, we look at how\nbuffering events and processing them in batches can benefit mobile\napplications. We evaluate our framework in terms of latency and throughput and\nshow examples of computer vision tasks that involve both event-by-event and\npre-trained neural network methods for gesture recognition, aperture robust\noptical flow and grey-level image reconstruction from events.

    "abstract": "Most permissionless blockchain networks run on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks,\nwhich offer flexibility and decentralization at the expense of performance\n(e.g., network latency). Historically, this tradeoff has not been a bottleneck\nfor most blockchains. However, an emerging host of blockchain-based\napplications (e.g., decentralized finance) are increasingly sensitive to\nlatency; users who can reduce their network latency relative to other users can\naccrue (sometimes significant) financial gains. In this work, we initiate the\nstudy of strategic latency reduction in blockchain P2P networks. We first\ndefine two classes of latency that are of interest in blockchain applications.\nWe then show empirically that a strategic agent who controls only their local\npeering decisions can manipulate both types of latency, achieving 60\\% of the\nglobal latency gains provided by the centralized, paid service bloXroute, or,\nin targeted scenarios, comparable gains. Finally, we show that our results are\nnot due to the poor design of existing P2P networks. Under a simple network\nmodel, we theoretically prove that an adversary can always manipulate the P2P\nnetwork's latency to their advantage, provided the network experiences\nsufficient peer churn and transaction activity.",

    "abstract": "What is the relation between a word and its description, or a word and its\nembedding? Both descriptions and embeddings are semantic representations of\nwords. But, what information from the original word remains in these\nrepresentations? Or more importantly, which information about a word do these\ntwo representations share? Definition Modeling and Reverse Dictionary are two\nopposite learning tasks that address these questions. The goal of the\nDefinition Modeling task is to investigate the power of information laying\ninside a word embedding to express the meaning of the word in a humanly\nunderstandable way -- as a dictionary definition. Conversely, the Reverse\nDictionary task explores the ability to predict word embeddings directly from\nits definition. In this paper, by tackling these two tasks, we are exploring\nthe relationship between words and their semantic representations.

    "abstract": "Providing minimum quality-of-service (QoS) in crowded wireless communications\nsystems, with high user density, is challenging due to the network structure\nwith limited transmit power budget and resource blocks. Smart resource\nallocation methods, such as user scheduling, power allocation, and modulation\nand coding scheme selection, must be implemented to cope with the challenge.\nAiming to enhance the number of served users with minimum QoS in the downlink\n(DL) channel of crowded extra-large scale massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, in this paper we propose a QoS-aware joint\nuser scheduling and power allocation technique. The proposed technique is\nconstituted by two sequential procedures: the clique search-based scheduling\n(CBS) algorithm for user scheduling followed by optimal power allocation with\ntransmit power budget and minimum achievable rate per user constraints. To\naccurately evaluate the proposed technique in the XL-MIMO scenario, we propose\na generalized non-stationary multi-state channel model based on spherical-wave\npropagation assuming that users under LoS and NLoS transmission coexist in the\nsame communication cell. Such model considers that users under different\nchannel states experience different propagation aspects both in the multipath\nfading model and the path loss rule. Numerical results on the achievable\nsum-rate, number of scheduled users, and distribution of the scheduled users\nreveal that the proposed CBS algorithm provides a fair coverage over the whole\ncell area, achieving remarkable numbers of scheduled users when users under the\nLoS and NLoS channel states coexist in the communication cell.",

    "abstract": "Statistical shape modeling (SSM) directly from 3D medical images is an\nunderutilized tool for detecting pathology, diagnosing disease, and conducting\npopulation-level morphology analysis. Deep learning frameworks have increased\nthe feasibility of adopting SSM in medical practice by reducing the\nexpert-driven manual and computational overhead in traditional SSM workflows.\nHowever, translating such frameworks to clinical practice requires calibrated\nuncertainty measures as neural networks can produce over-confident predictions\nthat cannot be trusted in sensitive clinical decision-making. Existing\ntechniques for predicting shape with aleatoric (data-dependent) uncertainty\nutilize a principal component analysis (PCA) based shape representation\ncomputed in isolation from the model training. This constraint restricts the\nlearning task to solely estimating pre-defined shape descriptors from 3D images\nand imposes a linear relationship between this shape representation and the\noutput (i.e., shape) space. In this paper, we propose a principled framework\nbased on the variational information bottleneck theory to relax these\nassumptions while predicting probabilistic shapes of anatomy directly from\nimages without supervised encoding of shape descriptors. Here, the latent\nrepresentation is learned in the context of the learning task, resulting in a\nmore scalable, flexible model that better captures data non-linearity.\nAdditionally, this model is self-regularized and generalizes better given\nlimited training data.

However, human evaluation is usually\ncostly, difficult to reproduce, and non-reusable. In this paper, we propose a\nnew and simple automatic evaluation method for NLG called Near-Negative\nDistinction (NND) that repurposes prior human annotations into NND tests. In an\nNND test, an NLG model must place higher likelihood on a high-quality output\ncandidate than on a near-negative candidate with a known error. Model\nperformance is established by the number of NND tests a model passes, as well\nas the distribution over task-specific errors the model fails on. Through\nexperiments on three NLG tasks (question generation, question answering, and\nsummarization), we show that NND achieves higher correlation with human\njudgments than standard NLG evaluation metrics. We then illustrate NND\nevaluation in four practical scenarios, for example performing fine-grain model\nanalysis, or studying model training dynamics. Our findings suggest NND can\ngive a second life to human annotations and provide low-cost NLG evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Pathology text mining is a challenging task given the reporting variability\nand constant new findings in cancer sub-type definitions. However, successful\ntext mining of a large pathology database can play a critical role to advance\n'big data' cancer research like similarity-based treatment selection, case\nidentification, prognostication, surveillance, clinical trial screening, risk\nstratification, and many others. While there is a growing interest in\ndeveloping language models for more specific clinical domains, no\npathology-specific language space exist to support the rapid data-mining\ndevelopment in pathology space. In literature, a few approaches fine-tuned\ngeneral transformer models on specialized corpora while maintaining the\noriginal tokenizer, but in fields requiring specialized terminology, these\nmodels often fail to perform adequately. We propose PathologyBERT - a\npre-trained masked language model which was trained on 347,173 histopathology\nspecimen reports and publicly released in the Huggingface repository. Our\ncomprehensive experiments demonstrate that pre-training of transformer model on\npathology corpora yields performance improvements on Natural Language\nUnderstanding (NLU) and Breast Cancer Diagnose Classification when compared to\nnonspecific language models.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel method to bootstrap text anonymization models based on\ndistant supervision. Instead of requiring manually labeled training data, the\napproach relies on a knowledge graph expressing the background information\nassumed to be publicly available about various individuals. This knowledge\ngraph is employed to automatically annotate text documents including personal\ndata about a subset of those individuals. More precisely, the method determines\nwhich text spans ought to be masked in order to guarantee $k$-anonymity,\nassuming an adversary with access to both the text documents and the background\ninformation expressed in the knowledge graph. The resulting collection of\nlabeled documents is then used as training data to fine-tune a pre-trained\nlanguage model for text anonymization. We illustrate this approach using a\nknowledge graph extracted from Wikidata and short biographical texts from\nWikipedia. Evaluation results with a RoBERTa-based model and a manually\nannotated collection of 553 summaries showcase the potential of the approach,\nbut also unveil a number of issues that may arise if the knowledge graph is\nnoisy or incomplete. The results also illustrate that, contrary to most\nsequence labeling problems, the text anonymization task may admit several\nalternative solutions.",

    "abstract": "A Backdoor attack (BA) is an important type of adversarial attack against\ndeep neural network classifiers, wherein test samples from one or more source\nclasses will be (mis)classified to the attacker's target class when a backdoor\npattern (BP) is embedded. In this paper, we focus on the post-training backdoor\ndefense scenario commonly considered in the literature, where the defender aims\nto detect whether a trained classifier was backdoor attacked, without any\naccess to the training set. To the best of our knowledge, existing\npost-training backdoor defenses are all designed for BAs with presumed BP\ntypes, where each BP type has a specific embedding function. They may fail when\nthe actual BP type used by the attacker (unknown to the defender) is different\nfrom the BP type assumed by the defender. In contrast, we propose a universal\npost-training defense that detects BAs with arbitrary types of BPs, without\nmaking any assumptions about the BP type. Our detector leverages the influence\nof the BA, independently of the BP type, on the landscape of the classifier's\noutputs prior to the softmax layer. For each class, a maximum margin statistic\nis estimated using a set of random vectors; detection inference is then\nperformed by applying an unsupervised anomaly detector to these statistics.\nThus, our detector is also an advance relative to most existing post-training\nmethods by not needing any legitimate clean samples, and can efficiently detect\nBAs with arbitrary numbers of source classes. These advantages of our detector\nover several state-of-the-art methods are demonstrated on four datasets, for\nthree different types of BPs, and for a variety of attack configurations.\nFinally, we propose a novel, general approach for BA mitigation once a\ndetection is made.",

However, because the relationship between various wind conditions and\nits effect on aircraft maneuverability is not well understood, it is\nchallenging to design effective robot controllers using traditional control\ndesign methods. We present Neural-Fly, a learning-based approach that allows\nrapid online adaptation by incorporating pretrained representations through\ndeep learning. Neural-Fly builds on two key observations that aerodynamics in\ndifferent wind conditions share a common representation and that the\nwind-specific part lies in a low-dimensional space. To that end, Neural-Fly\nuses a proposed learning algorithm, domain adversarially invariant\nmeta-learning (DAIML), to learn the shared representation, only using 12\nminutes of flight data. With the learned representation as a basis, Neural-Fly\nthen uses a composite adaptation law to update a set of linear coefficients for\nmixing the basis elements. When evaluated under challenging wind conditions\ngenerated with the Caltech Real Weather Wind Tunnel, with wind speeds up to\n43.6 kilometers/hour (12.1 meters/second), Neural-Fly achieves precise flight\ncontrol with substantially smaller tracking error than state-of-the-art\nnonlinear and adaptive controllers. In addition to strong empirical\nperformance, the exponential stability of Neural-Fly results in robustness\nguarantees.

    "abstract": "In this paper, a multi-lane multi-population microscopic model, which\npresents stop and go waves, is proposed to simulate traffic on a ring-road.\nVehicles are divided between human-driven and autonomous vehicles (AV). Control\nstrategies are designed with the ultimate goal of using a small number of AVs\n(less than 5\\% penetration rate) to represent Lagrangian control actuators that\ncan smooth the multilane traffic flow and dissipate the stop-and-go waves. This\nin turn may reduce fuel consumption and emissions.\nThe lane-changing mechanism is based on three components that we treat as\nparameters in the model: safety, incentive and cool-down time. The choice of\nthese parameters in the lane-change mechanism is critical to modeling traffic\naccurately, because different parameter values can lead to drastically\ndifferent traffic behaviors. In particular, the number of lane-changes and the\nspeed variance are highly affected by the choice of parameters. Despite this\nmodeling issue, when using sufficiently simple and robust controllers for AVs,\nthe stabilization of uniform flow steady-state is effective for any realistic\nvalue of the parameters, and ultimately bypasses the observed modeling issue.\nOur approach is based on accurate and rigorous mathematical models, which\nallows a limit procedure that is termed, in gas dynamic terminology,\nmean-field. In simple words, from increasing the human-driven population to\ninfinity, a system of coupled ordinary and partial differential equations are\nobtained. Moreover, control problems also pass to the limit, allowing the\ndesign to be tackled at different scales.",

    "abstract": "\\emph{Session types} have proved viable in expressing and verifying the\nprotocols of message-passing systems. While message passing is a dominant\nconcurrency paradigm in practice, real world software is written without\nsession types. A limitation of existing session type libraries in mainstream\nlanguages is their restriction to linear session types, precluding application\nscenarios that demand sharing and thus aliasing of channel references.\nThis paper introduces Ferrite, a shallow embedding of session types in Rust\nthat supports both \\emph{linear} and \\emph{shared} sessions. The formal\nfoundation of Ferrite constitutes the shared session type calculus $\\sills$,\nwhich Ferrite encodes via a novel \\emph{judgmental embedding} technique. The\nfulcrum of the embedding is the notion of a typing judgment that allows\nreasoning about shared and linear resources to type a session. Typing rules are\nthen encoded as functions over judgments, with a valid typing derivation\nmanifesting as a well-typed Rust program. This Rust program generated by\nFerrite serves as a \\emph{certificate}, ensuring that the application will\nproceed according to the protocol defined by the session type. The paper\ndetails the features and implementation of Ferrite and includes a case study on\nimplementing Servo's canvas component in Ferrite.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is currently one of the premier techniques to\ncreate data representations that are actionable for transfer learning in the\nabsence of human annotations. Despite their success, the underlying geometry of\nthese representations remains elusive, which obfuscates the quest for more\nrobust, trustworthy, and interpretable models. In particular, mainstream SSL\ntechniques rely on a specific deep neural network architecture with two\ncascaded neural networks: the encoder and the projector. When used for transfer\nlearning, the projector is discarded since empirical results show that its\nrepresentation generalizes more poorly than the encoder's. In this paper, we\ninvestigate this curious phenomenon and analyze how the strength of the data\naugmentation policies affects the data embedding. We discover a non-trivial\nrelation between the encoder, the projector, and the data augmentation\nstrength: with increasingly larger augmentation policies, the projector, rather\nthan the encoder, is more strongly driven to become invariant to the\naugmentations. It does so by eliminating crucial information about the data by\nlearning to project it into a low-dimensional space, a noisy estimate of the\ndata manifold tangent plane in the encoder representation. This analysis is\nsubstantiated through a geometrical perspective with theoretical and empirical\nresults.",

    "abstract": "Current robotic minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) platforms provide surgeons\nwith no haptic feedback of the robot's physical interactions. This limitation\nforces surgeons to rely heavily on visual feedback and can make it challenging\nfor surgical trainees to manipulate tissue gently. Prior research has\ndemonstrated that haptic feedback can increase task accuracy in RMIS training.\nHowever, it remains unclear whether these improvements represent a fundamental\nimprovement in skill, or if they simply stem from re-prioritizing accuracy over\ntask completion time. In this study, we provide haptic feedback of the force\napplied by the surgical instruments using custom wrist-squeezing devices. We\nhypothesize that individuals receiving haptic feedback will increase accuracy\n(produce less force) while increasing their task completion time, compared to a\ncontrol group receiving no haptic feedback. To test this hypothesis, N=21\nnovice participants were asked to repeatedly complete a ring rollercoaster\nsurgical training task as quickly as possible. Results show that participants\nreceiving haptic feedback apply significantly less force (0.67 N) than the\ncontrol group, and they complete the task no faster or slower than the control\ngroup after twelve repetitions. Furthermore, participants in the feedback group\ndecreased their task completion times significantly faster (7.68%) than\nparticipants in the control group (5.26%). This form of haptic feedback,\ntherefore, has the potential to help trainees improve their technical accuracy\nwithout compromising speed.",

    "abstract": "Global Positioning Systems (GPS) have played a crucial role in various\nnavigation applications. Nevertheless, localizing the perfect destination\nwithin the last few meters remains an important but unresolved problem. Limited\nby the GPS positioning accuracy, navigation systems always show users a\nvicinity of a destination, but not its exact location. Street view images (SVI)\nin maps as an immersive media technology have served as an aid to provide the\nphysical environment for human last-meters wayfinding. However, due to the\nlarge diversity of geographic context and acquisition conditions, the captured\nSVI always contains various distracting objects (e.g., pedestrians and\nvehicles), which will distract human visual attention from efficiently finding\nthe destination in the last few meters. To address this problem, we highlight\nthe importance of reducing visual distraction in image-based wayfinding by\nproposing a saliency-guided image inpainting framework. It aims at redirecting\nhuman visual attention from distracting objects to destination-related objects\nfor more efficient and accurate wayfinding in the last meters. Specifically, a\ncontext-aware distracting object detection method driven by deep salient object\ndetection has been designed to extract distracting objects from three semantic\nlevels in SVI. Then we employ a large-mask inpainting method with fast Fourier\nconvolutions to remove the detected distracting objects. Experimental results\nwith both qualitative and quantitative analysis show that our saliency-guided\ninpainting method can not only achieve great perceptual quality in street view\nimages but also redirect the human's visual attention to focus more on static\nlocation-related objects than distracting ones. The human-based evaluation also\njustified the effectiveness of our method in improving the efficiency of\nlocating the target destination.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has become omnipresent with applications in various\nsafety-critical domains such as medical, law, and transportation. In these\ndomains, high-stake decisions provided by machine learning necessitate\nresearchers to design interpretable models, where the prediction is\nunderstandable to a human. In interpretable machine learning, rule-based\nclassifiers are particularly effective in representing the decision boundary\nthrough a set of rules comprising input features. The interpretability of\nrule-based classifiers is in general related to the size of the rules, where\nsmaller rules are considered more interpretable. To learn such a classifier,\nthe brute-force direct approach is to consider an optimization problem that\ntries to learn the smallest classification rule that has close to maximum\naccuracy. This optimization problem is computationally intractable due to its\ncombinatorial nature and thus, the problem is not scalable in large datasets.\nTo this end, in this paper we study the triangular relationship among the\naccuracy, interpretability, and scalability of learning rule-based classifiers.\nThe contribution of this paper is an interpretable learning framework IMLI,\nthat is based on maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) for synthesizing\nclassification rules expressible in proposition logic. Despite the progress of\nMaxSAT solving in the last decade, the straightforward MaxSAT-based solution\ncannot scale. Therefore, we incorporate an efficient incremental learning\ntechnique inside the MaxSAT formulation by integrating mini-batch learning and\niterative rule-learning. In our experiments, IMLI achieves the best balance\namong prediction accuracy, interpretability, and scalability.

    "abstract": "We propose Unified Distributed Environment (UDE), an environment\nvirtualization toolkit for reinforcement learning research. UDE is designed to\nintegrate environments built on any simulation platform such as Gazebo, Unity,\nUnreal, and OpenAI Gym. Through environment virtualization, UDE enables\noffloading the environment for execution on a remote machine while still\nmaintaining a unified interface. The UDE interface is designed to support\nmulti-agent by default. With environment virtualization and its interface\ndesign, the agent policies can be trained in multiple machines for a\nmulti-agent environment. Furthermore, UDE supports integration with existing\nmajor RL toolkits for researchers to leverage the benefits. This paper\ndiscusses the components of UDE and its design decisions.",

    "abstract": "Physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) has recently received\nsignificant attention as a rapid version of physics-informed neural network\n(PINN) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The key\ncharacteristic is to fix the input layer weights with random values and use\nMoore-Penrose generalized inverse for the output layer weights. The framework\nis effective, but it easily suffers from overfitting noisy data and lacks\nuncertainty quantification for the solution under noise scenarios.To this end,\nwe develop the Bayesian physics-informed extreme learning machine (BPIELM) to\nsolve both forward and inverse linear PDE problems with noisy data in a unified\nframework. In our framework, a prior probability distribution is introduced in\nthe output layer for extreme learning machine with physic laws and the Bayesian\nmethod is used to estimate the posterior of parameters. Besides, for inverse\nPDE problems, problem parameters considered as new output layer weights are\nunified in a framework with forward PDE problems. Finally, we demonstrate\nBPIELM considering both forward problems, including Poisson, advection, and\ndiffusion equations, as well as inverse problems, where unknown problem\nparameters are estimated. The results show that, compared with PIELM, BPIELM\nquantifies uncertainty arising from noisy data and provides more accurate\npredictions. In addition, BPIELM is considerably cheaper than PINN in terms of\nthe computational cost.",

    "abstract": "Balancing the trade-off between safety and efficiency is of significant\nimportance for path planning under uncertainty. Many risk-aware path planners\nhave been developed to explicitly limit the probability of collision to an\nacceptable bound in uncertain environments. However, convex obstacles or\nGaussian uncertainties are usually assumed to make the problem tractable in the\nexisting method. These assumptions limit the generalization and application of\npath planners in real-world implementations. In this article, we propose to\napply deep learning methods to the sampling-based planner, developing a novel\nrisk bounded near-optimal path planning algorithm named neural risk-aware RRT\n(NR-RRT). Specifically, a deterministic risk contours map is maintained by\nperceiving the probabilistic nonconvex obstacles, and a neural network sampler\nis proposed to predict the next most-promising safe state. Furthermore, the\nrecursive divide-and-conquer planning and bidirectional search strategies are\nused to accelerate the convergence to a near-optimal solution with guaranteed\nbounded risk. Worst-case theoretical guarantees can also be proven owing to a\nstandby safety guaranteed planner utilizing a uniform sampling distribution.\nSimulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art remarkably for finding risk bounded low-cost paths in seen and\nunseen environments with uncertainty and nonconvex constraints.",

Due to multiple rounds\nof iterative updating of high-dimensional model parameters between base station\n(BS) and edge devices, the communication reliability is a critical issue of FL\nfor edge-intelligent networks.

    "abstract": "Consistency regularization has recently been applied to semi-supervised\nsequence-to-sequence (S2S) automatic speech recognition (ASR). This principle\nencourages an ASR model to output similar predictions for the same input speech\nwith different perturbations. The existing paradigm of semi-supervised S2S ASR\nutilizes SpecAugment as data augmentation and requires a static teacher model\nto produce pseudo transcripts for untranscribed speech. However, this paradigm\nfails to take full advantage of consistency regularization. First, the masking\noperations of SpecAugment may damage the linguistic contents of the speech,\nthus influencing the quality of pseudo labels. Second, S2S ASR requires both\ninput speech and prefix tokens to make the next prediction. The static prefix\ntokens made by the offline teacher model cannot match dynamic pseudo labels\nduring consistency training. In this work, we propose an improved consistency\ntraining paradigm of semi-supervised S2S ASR. We utilize speech chain\nreconstruction as the weak augmentation to generate high-quality pseudo labels.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that dynamic pseudo transcripts produced by the\nstudent ASR model benefit the consistency training. Experiments on LJSpeech and\nLibriSpeech corpora show that compared to supervised baselines, our improved\nparadigm achieves a 12.2% CER improvement in the single-speaker setting and\n38.6% in the multi-speaker setting.",

Therefore, we study the asynchronous online learning strategy of the\nplayers to adaptively adjust the next actions for minimizing the long-term\nregret loss. The paper provides a novel no-regret learning algorithm, called\nOnline Gradient Descent with lossy bandits (OGD-lb).

    "title": "Review-Based Tip Generation for Music Songs",
    "abstract": "Reviews of songs play an important role in online music service platforms.\nPrior research shows that users can make quicker and more informed decisions\nwhen presented with meaningful song reviews. However, reviews of music songs\nare generally long in length and most of them are non-informative for users. It\nis difficult for users to efficiently grasp meaningful messages for making\ndecisions. To solve this problem, one practical strategy is to provide tips,\ni.e., short, concise, empathetic, and self-contained descriptions about songs.\nTips are produced from song reviews and should express non-trivial insight\nabout the songs. To the best of our knowledge, no prior studies have explored\nthe tip generation task in music domain. In this paper, we create a dataset\nnamed MTips for the task and propose a framework named GenTMS for automatically\ngenerating tips from song reviews. The dataset involves 8,003 Chinese\ntips/non-tips from 128 songs which are distributed in five different song\ngenres. Experimental results show that GenTMS achieves top-10 precision at\n85.56%, outperforming the baseline models by at least 3.34%. Besides, to\nsimulate the practical usage of our proposed framework, we also experiment with\npreviously-unseen songs, during which GenTMS also achieves the best performance\nwith top-10 precision at 78.89% on average. The results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed framework in tip generation of the music domain.",

    "abstract": "The usage of deep learning is being escalated in many applications. Due to\nits outstanding performance, it is being used in a variety of security and\nprivacy-sensitive areas in addition to conventional applications. One of the\nkey aspects of deep learning efficacy is to have abundant data. This trait\nleads to the usage of data which can be highly sensitive and private, which in\nturn causes wariness with regard to deep learning in the general public.\nMembership inference attacks are considered lethal as they can be used to\nfigure out whether a piece of data belongs to the training dataset or not. This\ncan be problematic with regards to leakage of training data information and its\ncharacteristics. To highlight the significance of these types of attacks, we\npropose an enhanced methodology for membership inference attacks based on\nadversarial robustness, by adjusting the directions of adversarial\nperturbations through label smoothing under a white-box setting. We evaluate\nour proposed method on three datasets: Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.\nOur experimental results reveal that the performance of our method surpasses\nthat of the existing adversarial robustness-based method when attacking\nnormally trained models. Additionally, through comparing our technique with the\nstate-of-the-art metric-based membership inference methods, our proposed method\nalso shows better performance when attacking adversarially trained models.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation is an important area\nof research for alleviating the huge cost associated with the construction of\nreliable large-scale annotations in the medical domain. Recent semi-supervised\napproaches have demonstrated promising results by employing consistency\nregularization, pseudo-labeling techniques, and adversarial learning. These\nmethods primarily attempt to learn the distribution of labeled and unlabeled\ndata by enforcing consistency in the predictions or embedding context. However,\nprevious approaches have focused only on local discrepancy minimization or\ncontext relations across single classes. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nadversarial learning-based semi-supervised segmentation method that effectively\nembeds both local and global features from multiple hidden layers and learns\ncontext relations between multiple classes. Our voxel-wise adversarial learning\nmethod utilizes a voxel-wise feature discriminator, which considers multilayer\nvoxel-wise features (involving both local and global features) as an input by\nembedding class-specific voxel-wise feature distribution. Furthermore, we\nimprove our previous representation learning method by overcoming information\nloss and learning stability problems, which enables rich representations of\nlabeled data. Our method outperforms current best-performing state-of-the-art\nsemi-supervised learning approaches on the image segmentation of the left\natrium (single class) and multiorgan datasets (multiclass). Moreover, our\nvisual interpretation of the feature space demonstrates that our proposed\nmethod enables a well-distributed and separated feature space from both labeled\nand unlabeled data, which improves the overall prediction results.",

Numerous centrality measures have been proposed\nfor identifying and ranking the nodes according to their importance. Classical\ncentrality measures rely on various local or global properties of the nodes.\nThey do not take into account the network community structure. Recently, a\ngrowing number of researches have shifted to community-aware centrality\nmeasures. Indeed, it is a ubiquitous feature in a vast majority of real-world\nnetworks. In the literature, the focus is on designing community-aware\ncentrality measures. However, up to now, there is no systematic evaluation of\ntheir effectiveness. This study fills this gap. It allows answering which\ncommunity-aware centrality measure should be used in practical situations. We\ninvestigate seven influential community-aware centrality measures in an\nepidemic spreading process scenario using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered\n(SIR) model on a set of fifteen real-world networks. Results show that\ngenerally, the correlation between community-aware centrality measures is low.\nFurthermore, in a multiple-spreader problem, when resources are available,\ntargeting distant hubs using Modularity Vitality is more effective.

    "abstract": "The design of complex man-made systems mostly involves a conceptual modeling\nphase; therefore, it is important to ensure an appropriate analysis method for\nthese models. A key concept for such analysis is the development of a\ndiagramming technique (e.g., UML) because diagrams can describe entities and\nprocesses and emphasize important aspects of the systems being described. The\nanalysis also includes an examination of ontological concepts such as states\nand events, which are used as a basis for the modeling process. Studying\nfundamental concepts allows us to understand more deeply the relationship\nbetween these concepts and modeling frameworks. In this paper, we critically\nanalyze the classic definition of a state utilizing the thinging machine (TM)\nmodel. States in state machine diagrams are considered the appropriate basis\nfor modeling system behavioral aspects. Despite its wide application in\nhardware design, the integration of a state machine model into a software\nsystem s modeling requirements increased the difficulty of graphical\nrepresentation (e.g., integration between structural and behavioral diagrams).\nTo understand such a problem, in this paper, we project (create an equivalent\nrepresentation of) states in TM machines. As a case study, we re-modeled a\nstate machine of an assembly line system in a TM. The outcome is a complicated\npicture of assembly line behavior. Therefore, as an alternative solution, we\nre-modeled the assembly line based solely on the TM. This new model presents a\nclear contrast between state-based modeling of assembly line behavior and the\nTM approach. The TM modeling seems more systematic than its counterpart, the\nstate machine, and its notions are well defined. In a TM, states are just\ncompound events. A model of a more complex system than the one in the assembly\nline has strengthened such a conclusion.",

However, in the real-world, quickly identifying\nfake news is of great significance and the network may vary over time in terms\nof dynamic nodes and edges. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel\nDynamic Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (DHGNN) for fake news quick\ndetection.

Using 4 distinct sources of high-quality 3D meshes, the scenes of\nour dataset exhibit challenging variations in camera views, lighting, shape,\nmaterials, and textures.

    "abstract": "Teleoperation is often limited by the ability of an operator to react and\npredict the behavior of the robot as it interacts with the environment. For\nexample, to grasp small objects on a table, the teleoperator needs to predict\nthe position of the fingertips before the fingers are closed to avoid them\nhitting the table. For that reason, we developed the F1 hand, a single-motor\ngripper that facilitates teleoperation with the use of a fixed finger. The hand\nis capable of grasping objects as thin as a paper clip, and as heavy and large\nas a cordless drill. The applicability of the hand can be expanded by replacing\nthe fixed finger with different shapes. This flexibility makes the hand highly\nversatile while being easy and cheap to develop. However, due to the atypical\nasymmetric structure and actuation of the hand usual grasping strategies no\nlonger apply. Thus, we propose a controller that approximates actuation\nsymmetry by using the motion of the whole arm. The F1 hand and its controller\nare compared side-by-side with the original Toyota Human Support Robot (HSR)\ngripper in teleoperation using 22 objects from the YCB dataset in addition to\nsmall objects. The grasping time and peak contact forces could be decreased by\n20% and 70%, respectively while increasing success rates by 5%. Using an\noff-the-shelf grasp pose estimator for autonomous grasping, the system achieved\nsimilar success rates to the original HSR gripper, at the order of 80%.",

    "title": "Corrosion Detection for Industrial Objects: From Multi-Sensor System to  5D Feature Space",
    "abstract": "Corrosion is a form of damage that often appears on the surface of metal-made\nobjects used in industrial applications. Those damages can be critical\ndepending on the purpose of the used object. Optical-based testing systems\nprovide a form of non-contact data acquisition, where the acquired data can\nthen be used to analyse the surface of an object. In the field of industrial\nimage processing, this is called surface inspection. We provide a testing setup\nconsisting of a rotary table which rotates the object by 360 degrees, as well\nas industrial RGB cameras and laser triangulation sensors for the acquisition\nof 2D and 3D data as our multi-sensor system. These sensors acquire data while\nthe object to be tested takes a full rotation. Further on, data augmentation is\napplied to prepare new data or enhance already acquired data. In order to\nevaluate the impact of a laser triangulation sensor for corrosion detection,\none challenge is to at first fuse the data of both domains. After the data\nfusion process, 5 different channels can be utilized to create a 5D feature\nspace. Besides the red, green and blue channels of the image (1-3), additional\nrange data from the laser triangulation sensor is incorporated (4). As a fifth\nchannel, said sensor provides additional intensity data (5). With a\nmulti-channel image classification, a 5D feature space will lead to slightly\nsuperior results opposed to a 3D feature space, composed of only the RGB\nchannels of the image.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are poised to play a central role in\nrevolutionizing future services offered by the envisioned smart cities, thanks\nto their agility, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. UAVs are being widely\ndeployed in different verticals including surveillance, search and rescue\nmissions, delivery of items, and as an infrastructure for aerial communications\nin future wireless networks. UAVs can be used to survey target locations,\ncollect raw data from the ground (i.e., video streams), generate computing\ntask(s) and offload it to the available servers for processing. In this work,\nwe formulate a multi-objective optimization framework for both the network\nresource allocation and the UAV trajectory planning problem using Mixed Integer\nLinear Programming (MILP) optimization model. In consideration of the different\nstake holders that may exist in a Cloud-Fog environment, we minimize the sum of\na weighted objective function, which allows network operators to tune the\nweights to emphasize/de-emphasize different cost functions such as the\nend-to-end network power consumption (EENPC), processing power consumption\n(PPC), UAVs total flight distance (UAVTFD), and UAVs total power consumption\n(UAVTPC). Our optimization models and results enable the optimum offloading\ndecisions to be made under different constraints relating to EENPC, PPC, UAVTFD\nand UAVTPC which we explore in detail. For example, when the UAVs propulsion\nefficiency (UPE) is at its worst (10% considered), offloading via the macro\nbase station is the best choice and a maximum power saving of 34% can be\nachieved. Extensive studies on the UAVs coverage path planning (CPP) and\ncomputation offloading have been conducted, but none has tackled the issue in a\npractical Cloud-Fog architecture in which access, metro and core layers are\nconsidered in the service offloading in a distributed architecture like the\nCloud-Fog.",

The ability to plan high-level tasks can\nbe factored as (i) inferring specific goal predicates that characterize the\ntask implied by a language instruction for a given world state and (ii)\nsynthesizing a feasible goal-reaching action-sequence with such predicates. For\nthe former, we leverage a neural network prediction model, while utilizing a\nsymbolic planner for the latter.

Providing\nmultiple access to an increasing number of uncoordinated users and sharing the\nlimited resources become essential in this context. In this work, we revisit\nthe random access (RA) problem and exploit the continuous angular group\nsparsity feature of wireless channels to propose a novel RA strategy that\nprovides low latency, high reliability, and massive access with limited\nbandwidth resources in an all-in-one package. To this end, we first design a\nreconstruction-free goal-oriented optimization problem, which only preserves\nthe angular information required to identify the active devices. To solve this,\nwe propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and derive\nclosed-form expressions for each ADMM step. Then, we design a clustering\nalgorithm that assigns the users in specific groups from which we can identify\nactive stationary devices by their angles. For mobile devices, we propose an\nalternating minimization algorithm to recover their data and their channel\ngains simultaneously, which allows us to identify active mobile users.\nSimulation results show significant performance gains in terms of active user\ndetection and false alarm probabilities as compared to state-of-the-art RA\nschemes, even with limited number of preambles.

We propose a robust curb detection and filtering technique based on\nthe fusion of camera semantics and dense lidar point clouds. The lidar point\nclouds are collected by fusing multiple lidars for robust feature detection.\nThe camera semantics are based on a modified EfficientNet architecture which is\ntrained with labeled data collected from onboard fisheye cameras. The point\nclouds are associated with the closest curb segment with $L_2$-norm analysis\nafter projecting into the image space with the fisheye model projection. Next,\nthe selected points are clustered using unsupervised density-based spatial\nclustering to detect different curb regions. As new curb points are detected in\nconsecutive frames they are associated with the existing curb clusters using\ntemporal reachability constraints. If no reachability constraints are found a\nnew curb cluster is formed from these new points. This ensures we can detect\nmultiple curbs present in road segments consisting of multiple lanes if they\nare in the sensors' field of view. Finally, Delaunay filtering is applied for\noutlier removal and its performance is compared to traditional RANSAC-based\nfiltering. An objective evaluation of the proposed solution is done using a\nhigh-definition map containing ground truth curb points obtained from a\ncommercial map supplier.

    "abstract": "Forward-secure signatures guarantee that the signatures generated before the\ncompromise of private key remain secure, and therefore offer an enhanced\ncompromise-resiliency for real-life applications such as digital forensics,\naudit logs, and financial systems. However, the vast majority of\nstate-of-the-art forward-secure signatures rely on conventional intractability\nassumptions and therefore are not secure against quantum computers. Hash-based\nsignatures (HBS) (e.g., XMSS) can offer forward-secure post-quantum security.\nHowever, they are efficient only for a pre-defined number of messages to be\nsigned and incur high key generation overhead, highly expensive signing, and\nlarge signature sizes for an increasing number of messages. It is an open\nproblem to develop quantum-safe forward-secure signatures that are efficient\nand practical with a signing capability scalable to their security parameters.\nIn this work, we propose a new series of post-quantum signatures that we call\nFROG (Forward-secuRe pOst-quantum siGnature). Unlike HBS alternatives, FROG can\nachieve highly computational efficient signatures with sub-linear key/signature\nsizes and (practically) unbounded signing capability. This is achieved by\ntransforming suitable post-quantum signatures into forward-secure settings via\nMMM constructions. We investigated the transformation of prominent post-quantum\nsecure signatures such as Dilithium, WOTS, and BLISS with MMM. Our experiments\nindicate that FROG outperforms XMSS for the vast majority (if not all for a\nlarge number of messages) of performance metrics. We also discuss one-time\nvariants of these base signature schemes that can push the performance of FROG\nto the edge. Overall, FROG shows a better performance than the existing\nalternatives with forward-security and therefore is an ideal alternative for\nthe standardization efforts for forward-secure post-quantum signatures.",

In order to reduce human error, it has become imperative to\nuse efficient and low computational AI algorithms to identify such defective\nproducts. In this paper, we have compared and contrasted various pre-trained\nand custom-built architectures using model size, performance and CPU latency in\nthe detection of defective casting products. Our results show that custom\narchitectures are efficient than pre-trained mobile architectures. Moreover,\ncustom models perform 6 to 9 times faster than lightweight models such as\nMobileNetV2 and NasNet. The number of training parameters and the model size of\nthe custom architectures is significantly lower (~386 times & ~119 times\nrespectively) than the best performing models such as MobileNetV2 and NasNet.\nAugmentation experimentations have also been carried out on the custom\narchitectures to make the models more robust and generalizable. Our work sheds\nlight on the efficiency of these custom-built architectures for deployment on\nEdge and IoT devices and that transfer learning models may not always be ideal.\nInstead, they should be specific to the kind of dataset and the classification\nproblem at hand.",

Search-and-rescue after a disaster and intelligence, surveillance,\nand reconnaissance (ISR) are two examples where the UAV nodes need to send\ntheir collected data cooperatively into a central decision maker unit. Recently\nproposed SDN-based solutions show incredible performance in managing different\naspects of such networks. Alas, the routing problem for the highly dynamic UAV\nnetworks has not been addressed adequately. An optimal, reliable, and adaptive\nrouting algorithm compatible with the SDN design and highly dynamic nature of\nsuch networks is required to improve the network performance.

LB-OPAR is the\nextension of our recently published routing algorithm (OPAR) that balances the\nnetwork load and optimizes the network performance in terms of throughput,\nsuccess rate, and flow completion time (FCT). We analytically model the routing\nproblem in highly dynamic UAV network and propose a lightweight algorithmic\nsolution to find the optimal solution with $O(|E|^2)$ time complexity where\n$|E|$ is the total number of network links.

    "abstract": "The heterogeneous edge-cloud computing paradigm can provide an optimal\nsolution to deploy scientific workflows compared to cloud computing or other\ntraditional distributed computing environments. Owing to the different sizes of\nscientific datasets and the privacy issue concerning some of these datasets, it\nis essential to find a data placement strategy that can minimize data\ntransmission time. Some state-of-the-art data placement strategies combine edge\ncomputing and cloud computing to distribute scientific datasets. However, the\ndynamic distribution of newly generated datasets to appropriate datacenters and\nexiting the spent datasets are still a challenge during workflows execution. To\naddress this challenge, this study not only constructs a data placement model\nthat includes shared datasets within individual and among multiple workflows\nacross various geographical regions, but also proposes a data placement\nstrategy (DYM-RL-DPS) based on algorithms of two stages. First, during the\nbuild-time stage of workflows, we use the discrete particle swarm optimization\nalgorithm with differential evolution to pre-allocate initial datasets to\nproper datacenters. Then, we reformulate the dynamic datasets distribution\nproblem as a Markov decision process and provide a reinforcement learning-based\napproach to learn the optimal strategy in the runtime stage of scientific\nworkflows. Through simulating heterogeneous edge-cloud computing environments,\nwe designed comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of\nDYM-RL-DPS.

    "abstract": "Untrimmed video understanding such as temporal action detection (TAD) often\nsuffers from the pain of huge demand for computing resources. Because of long\nvideo durations and limited GPU memory, most action detectors can only operate\non pre-extracted features rather than the original videos, and they still\nrequire a lot of computation to achieve high detection performance. To\nalleviate the heavy computation problem in TAD, in this work, we first propose\nan efficient action detector with detector proposal sampling, based on the\nobservation that performance saturates at a small number of proposals. This\ndetector is designed with several important techniques, such as LSTM-boosted\ntemporal aggregation and cascaded proposal refinement to achieve high detection\nquality as well as low computational cost. To enable joint optimization of this\naction detector and the feature encoder, we also propose encoder gradient\nsampling, which selectively back-propagates through video snippets and\ntremendously reduces GPU memory consumption. With the two sampling strategies\nand the effective detector, we build a unified framework for efficient\nend-to-end temporal action detection (ETAD), making real-world untrimmed video\nunderstanding tractable. ETAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both\nTHUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-1.3. Interestingly, on ActivityNet-1.3, it reaches\n37.78% average mAP, while only requiring 6 mins of training time and 1.23 GB\nmemory based on pre-extracted features. With end-to-end training, it reduces\nthe GPU memory footprint by more than 70% with even higher performance (38.21%\naverage mAP), as compared with traditional end-to-end methods.

    "abstract": "Empowered by the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, deep neural networks have\ndominated the race in solving various cognitive tasks. The restricted training\npattern in the standard BP requires end-to-end error propagation, causing large\nmemory cost and prohibiting model parallelization. Existing local training\nmethods aim to resolve the training obstacle by completely cutting off the\nbackward path between modules and isolating their gradients to reduce memory\ncost and accelerate the training process. These methods prevent errors from\nflowing between modules and hence information exchange, resulting in inferior\nperformance. This work proposes a novel local training algorithm, BackLink,\nwhich introduces inter-module backward dependency and allows errors to flow\nbetween modules. The algorithm facilitates information to flow backward along\nwith the network. To preserve the computational advantage of local training,\nBackLink restricts the error propagation length within the module. Extensive\nexperiments performed in various deep convolutional neural networks demonstrate\nthat our method consistently improves the classification performance of local\ntraining algorithms over other methods. For example, in ResNet32 with 16 local\nmodules, our method surpasses the conventional greedy local training method by\n4.00\\% and a recent work by 1.83\\% in accuracy on CIFAR10, respectively.\nAnalysis of computational costs reveals that small overheads are incurred in\nGPU memory costs and runtime on multiple GPUs. Our method can lead up to a 79\\%\nreduction in memory cost and 52\\% in simulation runtime in ResNet110 compared\nto the standard BP.

    "abstract": "There is a great demand for vision-based robotics solutions that can operate\nusing Global Positioning Systems (GPS), but are also robust against GPS signal\nloss and gyroscope failure. This paper investigates the estimation and tracking\ncontrol in application to a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) in six degrees of freedom (6 DoF). A full state observer\nfor the estimation of VTOL-UAV motion parameters (attitude, angular velocity,\nposition, and linear velocity) is proposed on the Lie Group of\n$\\mathbb{SE}_{2}\\left(3\\right)\\times\\mathbb{R}^{3}$\n$=\\mathbb{SO}\\left(3\\right)\\times\\mathbb{R}^{9}$ with almost globally\nexponentially stable closed loop error signals. Thereafter, a full state\nobserver-based controller for the VTOL-UAV motion parameters is proposed on the\nLie Group with a guaranteed almost global exponential stability. The proposed\napproach produces good results without the need for angular and linear velocity\nmeasurements (without a gyroscope and GPS signals) utilizing only a set of\nknown landmarks obtained by a vision-aided unit (monocular or stereo camera).\nThe equivalent quaternion representation on\n$\\mathbb{S}^{3}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{9}$ is provided in the Appendix. The\nobserver-based controller is presented in a continuous form while its discrete\nversion is tested using a VTOL-UAV simulation that incorporates large initial\nerror and uncertain measurements. The proposed observer is additionally tested\nexperimentally on a real-world UAV flight dataset.

In recent years, thanks to the\nresurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), image inpainting task has\nmade great breakthroughs. However, most of the work consider insufficient types\nof mask, and their performance will drop dramatically when encountering unseen\nmasks. To combat these challenges, we propose a simple yet general method to\nsolve this problem based on the LaMa image inpainting framework, dubbed GLaMa.\nOur proposed GLaMa can better capture different types of missing information by\nusing more types of masks. By incorporating more degraded images in the\ntraining phase, we can expect to enhance the robustness of the model with\nrespect to various masks. In order to yield more reasonable results, we further\nintroduce a frequency-based loss in addition to the traditional spatial\nreconstruction loss and adversarial loss. In particular, we introduce an\neffective reconstruction loss both in the spatial and frequency domain to\nreduce the chessboard effect and ripples in the reconstructed image. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method can boost the performance over the\noriginal LaMa method for each type of mask on FFHQ, ImageNet, Places2 and\nWikiArt dataset.

    "abstract": "Growing interests in RGB-D salient object detection (RGB-D SOD) have been\nwitnessed in recent years, owing partly to the popularity of depth sensors and\nthe rapid progress of deep learning techniques. Unfortunately, existing RGB-D\nSOD methods typically demand large quantity of training images being thoroughly\nannotated at pixel-level. The laborious and time-consuming manual annotation\nhas become a real bottleneck in various practical scenarios. On the other hand,\ncurrent unsupervised RGB-D SOD methods still heavily rely on handcrafted\nfeature representations. This inspires us to propose in this paper a deep\nunsupervised RGB-D saliency detection approach, which requires no manual\npixel-level annotation during training. It is realized by two key ingredients\nin our training pipeline. First, a depth-disentangled saliency update (DSU)\nframework is designed to automatically produce pseudo-labels with iterative\nfollow-up refinements, which provides more trustworthy supervision signals for\ntraining the saliency network. Second, an attentive training strategy is\nintroduced to tackle the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, by properly re-weighting\nto highlight the more reliable pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe superior efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in tackling the\nchallenging unsupervised RGB-D SOD scenarios. Moreover, our approach can also\nbe adapted to work in fully-supervised situation. Empirical studies show the\nincorporation of our approach gives rise to notably performance improvement in\nexisting supervised RGB-D SOD models.",

    "title": "Towards a Comprehensive Solution for a Vision-based Digitized  Neurological Examination",
    "abstract": "The ability to use digitally recorded and quantified neurological exam\ninformation is important to help healthcare systems deliver better care,\nin-person and via telehealth, as they compensate for a growing shortage of\nneurologists. Current neurological digital biomarker pipelines, however, are\nnarrowed down to a specific neurological exam component or applied for\nassessing specific conditions. In this paper, we propose an accessible\nvision-based exam and documentation solution called Digitized Neurological\nExamination (DNE) to expand exam biomarker recording options and clinical\napplications using a smartphone/tablet. Through our DNE software, healthcare\nproviders in clinical settings and people at home are enabled to video capture\nan examination while performing instructed neurological tests, including finger\ntapping, finger to finger, forearm roll, and stand-up and walk. Our modular\ndesign of the DNE software supports integrations of additional tests. The DNE\nextracts from the recorded examinations the 2D/3D human-body pose and\nquantifies kinematic and spatio-temporal features. The features are clinically\nrelevant and allow clinicians to document and observe the quantified movements\nand the changes of these metrics over time. A web server and a user interface\nfor recordings viewing and feature visualizations are available. DNE was\nevaluated on a collected dataset of 21 subjects containing normal and\nsimulated-impaired movements. The overall accuracy of DNE is demonstrated by\nclassifying the recorded movements using various machine learning models. Our\ntests show an accuracy beyond 90% for upper-limb tests and 80% for the stand-up\nand walk tests.",

To apply machine learning (ML) in such\napplications, the traditional way of downloading satellite data such as imagery\nto a ground station (GS) and then training a model in a centralized manner, is\nnot desirable because of the limited bandwidth, intermittent connectivity\nbetween satellites and the GS, and privacy concerns on transmitting raw data.\nFederated Learning (FL) as an emerging communication and computing paradigm\nprovides a potentially supreme solution to this problem. However, we show that\nexisting FL solutions do not fit well in such LEO constellation scenarios\nbecause of significant challenges such as excessive convergence delay and\nunreliable wireless channels. To this end, we propose to introduce\nhigh-altitude platforms (HAPs) as distributed parameter servers (PSs) and\npropose a synchronous FL algorithm, FedHAP, to accomplish model training in an\nefficient manner via inter-satellite collaboration. To accelerate convergence,\nwe also propose a layered communication scheme between satellites and HAPs that\nFedHAP leverages. Our simulations demonstrate that FedHAP attains model\nconvergence in much fewer communication rounds than benchmarks, cutting the\ntraining time substantially from several days down to a few hours with the same\nlevel of resulting accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The ability to maintain compliance during interaction with the human or\nenvironments while avoiding the undesired destabilization could be extremely\nimportant for further application in practicality for soft actuators. In this\npaper, a soft-rigid hybrid actuator with multi-direction tunable stiffness\nproperty was proposed. The multi-direction tunable stiffness property, which\nmeans that the stiffness of multiple directions can be decoupled for\nmodulation, was achieved in two orthogonal directions, the bending direction (B\ndirection) and the direction perpendicular to bending (PB direction). In the B\ndirection, the stiffness was modulated through the antagonistic effect of the\ntendon-air hybrid driven; In the PB direction, the jamming effect brought by a\nnovel structure, the bone-like structure (BLS), reinforces the PB-direction\nstiffness. Meanwhile, in this paper, the corresponding fabrication method to\nensure airtightness was designed, and the working principle for the two\nmechanisms of the actuator was evaluated. Finally, a series of experiments have\nbeen conducted to characterize the performance of the actuator and analyze the\nstiffness variation in two orthogonal directions. According to the tests, the\nmaximum fingertip force reached 7.83N. And the experiments showed that\nstiffness in two directions can be tuned respectively. The B-direction\nstiffness can be tuned 1.5-4 times with a maximum stiffness of 1.24 N/mm. The\nPB-direction stiffness was enhanced about 4 times compared with the actuator\nwithout the mechanism, and it can be tuned decoupling with a range of 1.5\ntimes.",

    "abstract": "Imperfect-Information Extensive-Form Games (IIEFGs) is a prevalent model for\nreal-world games involving imperfect information and sequential plays. The\nExtensive-Form Correlated Equilibrium (EFCE) has been proposed as a natural\nsolution concept for multi-player general-sum IIEFGs. However, existing\nalgorithms for finding an EFCE require full feedback from the game, and it\nremains open how to efficiently learn the EFCE in the more challenging bandit\nfeedback setting where the game can only be learned by observations from\nrepeated playing.\nThis paper presents the first sample-efficient algorithm for learning the\nEFCE from bandit feedback. We begin by proposing $K$-EFCE -- a more generalized\ndefinition that allows players to observe and deviate from the recommended\nactions for $K$ times. The $K$-EFCE includes the EFCE as a special case at\n$K=1$, and is an increasingly stricter notion of equilibrium as $K$ increases.\nWe then design an uncoupled no-regret algorithm that finds an\n$\\varepsilon$-approximate $K$-EFCE within\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\max_{i}X_iA_i^{K}/\\varepsilon^2)$ iterations in the\nfull feedback setting, where $X_i$ and $A_i$ are the number of information sets\nand actions for the $i$-th player. Our algorithm works by minimizing a\nwide-range regret at each information set that takes into account all possible\nrecommendation histories. Finally, we design a sample-based variant of our\nalgorithm that learns an $\\varepsilon$-approximate $K$-EFCE within\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\max_{i}X_iA_i^{K+1}/\\varepsilon^2)$ episodes of play\nin the bandit feedback setting.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning methods for multi-agent systems make optimal\ndecisions dependent on states observed by agents, but a little uncertainty on\nthe observations can possibly mislead agents into taking wrong actions. The\nmean-field actor-critic reinforcement learning (MFAC) is very famous in the\nmulti-agent field since it can effectively handle the scalability problem.\nHowever, this paper finds that it is also sensitive to state perturbations\nwhich can significantly degrade the team rewards. This paper proposes a robust\nlearning framework for MFAC called RoMFAC that has two innovations: 1) a new\nobjective function of training actors, composed of a \\emph{policy gradient\nfunction} that is related to the expected cumulative discount reward on sampled\nclean states and an \\emph{action loss function} that represents the difference\nbetween actions taken on clean and adversarial states; and 2) a repetitive\nregularization of the action loss that ensures the trained actors obtain a good\nperformance. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed action loss function is\nconvergent. Experiments show that RoMFAC is robust against adversarial\nperturbations while maintaining its good performance in environments without\nperturbations.",

Specifically, a source node $(S)$\ncommunicates with a destination node $(D)$ through a decode-and-forward relay\n$(R)$, in the presence of two wiretappers $\\left(E_{1},E_{2}\\right)$\nindependently trying to compromise the two hops. Furthermore, the transmit\nnodes $\\left(S,R\\right) $ have a single transmit antenna, while the receivers\n$\\left(R,D,E_{1},E_{2}\\right) $ are equipped with multiple receive antennas.\nBased on the per-hop signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and correlated secrecy\ncapacities' statistics, a closed-form expression for the secrecy intercept\nprobability (IP) metric is derived, in terms of key system parameters.\nAdditionally, asymptotic expressions are revealed for two scenarios, namely (i)\nmobile nodes with imperfect CSI and (ii) static nodes with perfect CSI. The\nresults show that a zero secrecy diversity order is manifested for the first\nscenario, due to the presence of a ceiling value of the average SNR, while the\nIP drops linearly at high average SNR in the second one, where the achievable\ndiversity order depends on the fading parameters and number of antennas of the\nlegitimate links/nodes. Furthermore, for static nodes, the system can be\ncastigated by a $15$ dB secrecy loss at IP$=3\\times10^{-3},$ when the CSI\nimperfection power raises from $0$ to $10^{-3}$.

Our findings show: i) a\nmodel learns novel concepts (e.g. animal categories and demographic groups),\nwhich do not strictly adhere to any pre-defined categorization (e.g. POS,\nsemantic tags), ii) several latent concepts are based on multiple properties\nwhich may include semantics, syntax, and morphology, iii) the lower layers in\nthe model dominate in learning shallow lexical concepts while the higher layers\nlearn semantic relations and iv) the discovered latent concepts highlight\npotential biases learned in the model.

In this paper, we theoretically and empirically analyze the\nrelationship between the unlabeled data distribution and the desirable\nconfidence threshold. Our analysis shows that previous methods might fail to\ndefine favorable threshold since they either require a pre-defined / fixed\nthreshold or an ad-hoc threshold adjusting scheme that does not reflect the\nlearning effect well, resulting in inferior performance and slow convergence,\nespecially for complicated unlabeled data distributions. We hence propose\n\\emph{FreeMatch} to define and adjust the confidence threshold in a\nself-adaptive manner according to the model's learning status. To handle\ncomplicated unlabeled data distributions more effectively, we further propose a\nself-adaptive class fairness regularization method that encourages the model to\nproduce diverse predictions during training. Extensive experimental results\nindicate the superiority of FreeMatch especially when the labeled data are\nextremely rare. FreeMatch achieves \\textbf{5.78}\\%, \\textbf{13.59}\\%, and\n\\textbf{1.28}\\% error rate reduction over the latest state-of-the-art method\nFlexMatch on CIFAR-10 with 1 label per class, STL-10 with 4 labels per class,\nand ImageNet with 100k labels respectively.",

In this work, we address two important\nproblems to extend the current success of offline model-based optimization to\nindustrial process control problems: 1) how to learn a reliable dynamics model\nfrom offline data for industrial processes? 2) how to learn a reliable but not\nover-conservative control policy from offline data by utilizing existing\nmodel-based optimization algorithms?

Furthermore, we propose an\nepistemic-uncertainty-penalized reward evaluation function which can\neffectively avoid giving over-estimated rewards to out-of-distribution inputs\nduring the learning/searching of the optimal control policy.

Recent works point out that\ndifferent graph learning tasks require different ranges of interactions between\nnodes. To investigate its underlying mechanism, we explore the capacity of GNNs\nto capture pairwise interactions between nodes under contexts with different\ncomplexities, especially for their graph-level and node-level applications in\nscientific domains like biochemistry and physics. When formulating pairwise\ninteractions, we study two common graph construction methods in scientific\ndomains, i.e., \\emph{K-nearest neighbor} (KNN) graphs and\n\\emph{fully-connected} (FC) graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the\ninductive bias introduced by KNN-graphs and FC-graphs hinders GNNs to learn the\nmost informative order of interactions. {Such a phenomenon is broadly shared by\nseveral GNNs for different graph learning tasks and forbids GNNs to achieve the\nglobal minimum loss, so we name it a \\emph{representation bottleneck}.} To\novercome that, we propose a novel graph rewiring approach based on the pairwise\ninteraction strengths to dynamically adjust the reception fields of each node.\nExtensive experiments in molecular property prediction and dynamic system\nforecast prove the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art GNN\nbaselines.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms have become\nubiquitous. Although they offer a wide range of benefits, their adoption in\ndecision-critical fields is limited by their lack of interpretability,\nparticularly with textual data. Moreover, with more data available than ever\nbefore, it has become increasingly important to explain automated predictions.\nGenerally, users find it difficult to understand the underlying computational\nprocesses and interact with the models, especially when the models fail to\ngenerate the outcomes or explanations, or both, correctly. This problem\nhighlights the growing need for users to better understand the models' inner\nworkings and gain control over their actions. This dissertation focuses on two\nfundamental challenges of addressing this need. The first involves explanation\ngeneration: inferring high-quality explanations from text documents in a\nscalable and data-driven manner. The second challenge consists in making\nexplanations actionable, and we refer to it as critiquing. This dissertation\nexamines two important applications in natural language processing and\nrecommendation tasks.\nOverall, we demonstrate that interpretability does not come at the cost of\nreduced performance in two consequential applications. Our framework is\napplicable to other fields as well. This dissertation presents an effective\nmeans of closing the gap between promise and practice in artificial\nintelligence.",

    "abstract": "As post hoc explanation methods are increasingly being leveraged to explain\ncomplex models in high-stakes settings, it becomes critical to ensure that the\nquality of the resulting explanations is consistently high across various\npopulation subgroups including the minority groups. For instance, it should not\nbe the case that explanations associated with instances belonging to a\nparticular gender subgroup (e.g., female) are less accurate than those\nassociated with other genders. However, there is little to no research that\nassesses if there exist such group-based disparities in the quality of the\nexplanations output by state-of-the-art explanation methods. In this work, we\naddress the aforementioned gaps by initiating the study of identifying\ngroup-based disparities in explanation quality. To this end, we first outline\nthe key properties which constitute explanation quality and where disparities\ncan be particularly problematic. We then leverage these properties to propose a\nnovel evaluation framework which can quantitatively measure disparities in the\nquality of explanations output by state-of-the-art methods. Using this\nframework, we carry out a rigorous empirical analysis to understand if and when\ngroup-based disparities in explanation quality arise. Our results indicate that\nsuch disparities are more likely to occur when the models being explained are\ncomplex and highly non-linear. In addition, we also observe that certain post\nhoc explanation methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients, SHAP) are more likely to\nexhibit the aforementioned disparities. To the best of our knowledge, this work\nis the first to highlight and study the problem of group-based disparities in\nexplanation quality. In doing so, our work sheds light on previously unexplored\nways in which explanation methods may introduce unfairness in real world\ndecision making.",

Instead of purely relying on\na fixed teacher trained on noisy labels, we keep updating the teacher to refine\nits pseudo-labels.

Several states\nand cities in the U.S. have banned the use of facial recognition by law\nenforcement and governments, but FPT are still being developed and used in a\nwide variety of contexts where they primarily are regulated by state biometric\ninformation privacy laws. Among these laws, the 2008 Illinois Biometric\nInformation Privacy Act (BIPA) has generated a significant amount of\nlitigation. Yet, with most BIPA lawsuits reaching settlements before there have\nbeen meaningful clarifications of relevant technical intricacies and legal\ndefinitions, there remains a great degree of uncertainty as to how exactly this\nlaw applies to FPT. What we have found through applications of BIPA in FPT\nlitigation so far, however, points to potential disconnects between technical\nand legal communities. This paper analyzes what we know based on BIPA court\nproceedings and highlights these points of tension: areas where the technical\noperationalization of BIPA may create unintended and undesirable incentives for\nFPT development, as well as areas where BIPA litigation can bring to light the\nlimitations of solely technical methods in achieving legal privacy values.\nThese factors are relevant for (i) reasoning about biometric information\nprivacy laws as a governing mechanism for FPT, (ii) assessing the potential\nharms of FPT, and (iii) providing incentives for the mitigation of these harms.\nBy illuminating these considerations, we hope to empower courts and lawmakers\nto take a more nuanced approach to regulating FPT and developers to better\nunderstand privacy values in the current U.S. legal landscape.",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have motivated a rapid growth of the\ndomain of computer image synthesis. As almost all the existing image synthesis\nalgorithms consider an image as a pixel matrix, the high-resolution image\nsynthesis is complicated.A good alternative can be vector images. However, they\nbelong to the highly sophisticated parametric space, which is a restriction for\nsolving the task of synthesizing vector graphics by GANs. In this paper, we\nconsider a specific application domain that softens this restriction\ndramatically allowing the usage of vector image synthesis.\nMusic cover images should meet the requirements of Internet streaming\nservices and printing standards, which imply high resolution of graphic\nmaterials without any additional requirements on the content of such images.\nExisting music cover image generation services do not analyze tracks\nthemselves; however, some services mostly consider only genre tags. To generate\nmusic covers as vector images that reflect the music and consist of simple\ngeometric objects, we suggest a GAN-based algorithm called CoverGAN. The\nassessment of resulting images is based on their correspondence to the music\ncompared with AttnGAN and DALL-E text-to-image generation according to title or\nlyrics. Moreover, the significance of the patterns found by CoverGAN has been\nevaluated in terms of the correspondence of the generated cover images to the\nmusical tracks. Listeners evaluate the music covers generated by the proposed\nalgorithm as quite satisfactory and corresponding to the tracks. Music cover\nimages generation code and demo are available at\nhttps://github.com/IzhanVarsky/CoverGAN.",

    "abstract": "We investigate graph neural networks on graphs with heterophily. Some\nexisting methods amplify a node's neighborhood with multi-hop neighbors to\ninclude more nodes with homophily. However, it is a significant challenge to\nset personalized neighborhood sizes for different nodes. Further, for other\nhomophilous nodes excluded in the neighborhood, they are ignored for\ninformation aggregation. To address these problems, we propose two models\nGloGNN and GloGNN++, which generate a node's embedding by aggregating\ninformation from global nodes in the graph. In each layer, both models learn a\ncoefficient matrix to capture the correlations between nodes, based on which\nneighborhood aggregation is performed. The coefficient matrix allows signed\nvalues and is derived from an optimization problem that has a closed-form\nsolution. We further accelerate neighborhood aggregation and derive a linear\ntime complexity. We theoretically explain the models' effectiveness by proving\nthat both the coefficient matrix and the generated node embedding matrix have\nthe desired grouping effect.

In this work, we focus on a\nnew type of drug design problem -- generating a small \"linker\" to physically\nattach two independent molecules with their distinct functions. The main\ncomputational challenges include: 1) the generation of linkers is conditional\non the two given molecules, in contrast to generating full molecules from\nscratch in previous works; 2) linkers heavily depend on the anchor atoms of the\ntwo molecules to be connected, which are not known beforehand; 3) 3D structures\nand orientations of the molecules need to be considered to avoid atom clashes,\nfor which equivariance to E(3) group are necessary. To address these problems,\nwe propose a conditional generative model, named 3DLinker, which is able to\npredict anchor atoms and jointly generate linker graphs and their 3D structures\nbased on an E(3) equivariant graph variational autoencoder. So far as we know,\nthere are no previous models that could achieve this task.

However, since the initial large learning rate generally helps the\noptimizer to converge to flatter minima, we hypothesize that the winning\ntickets have relatively sharp minima, which is considered a disadvantage in\nterms of generalization ability.

As such,\nimproving its computational efficiency becomes paramount. One of the major\ncomputational inefficiency of Transformer-based models is that they spend the\nidentical amount of computation throughout all layers. Prior works have\nproposed to augment the Transformer model with the capability of skimming\ntokens to improve its computational efficiency. However, they suffer from not\nhaving effectual and end-to-end optimization of the discrete skimming\npredictor. To address the above limitations, we propose the Transkimmer\narchitecture, which learns to identify hidden state tokens that are not\nrequired by each layer. The skimmed tokens are then forwarded directly to the\nfinal output, thus reducing the computation of the successive layers. The key\nidea in Transkimmer is to add a parameterized predictor before each layer that\nlearns to make the skimming decision. We also propose to adopt\nreparameterization trick and add skim loss for the end-to-end training of\nTranskimmer.

    "abstract": "Automatic food detection is an emerging topic of interest due to its wide\narray of applications ranging from detecting food images on social media\nplatforms to filtering non-food photos from the users in dietary assessment\napps. Recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has facilitated enforcing an\neating ban by automatically detecting eating activities from cameras in public\nplaces. Therefore, to tackle the challenge of recognizing food images with high\naccuracy, we proposed the idea of a hybrid framework for extracting and\nselecting optimal features from an efficient neural network. There on, a\nnonlinear classifier is employed to discriminate between linearly inseparable\nfeature vectors with great precision. In line with this idea, our method\nextracts features from MobileNetV3, selects an optimal subset of attributes by\nusing Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, and exploits kernel extreme\nlearning machine (KELM) due to its nonlinear decision boundary and good\ngeneralization ability. However, KELM suffers from the 'curse of dimensionality\nproblem' for large datasets due to the complex computation of kernel matrix\nwith large numbers of hidden nodes. We solved this problem by proposing a novel\nmulticolumn kernel extreme learning machine (MCKELM) which exploited the k-d\ntree algorithm to divide data into N subsets and trains separate KELM on each\nsubset of data. Then, the method incorporates KELM classifiers into parallel\nstructures and selects the top k nearest subsets during testing by using the\nk-d tree search for classifying input instead of the whole network. For\nevaluating a proposed framework large food/non-food dataset is prepared using\nnine publically available datasets. Experimental results showed the superiority\nof our method on an integrated set of measures while solving the problem of\n'curse of dimensionality in KELM for large datasets.",

The\ncanonical utterance is often lengthy and complex due to the compositional\nstructure of formal languages. Learning to generate such canonical utterance\nrequires significant amount of data to reach high performance. Fine-tuning with\nonly few-shot samples, the LMs can easily forget pretrained knowledge, overfit\nspurious biases, and suffer from compositionally out-of-distribution\ngeneralization errors. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel few-shot\nsemantic parsing method -- SeqZero. SeqZero decomposes the problem into a\nsequence of sub-problems, which correspond to the sub-clauses of the formal\nlanguage. Based on the decomposition, the LMs only need to generate short\nanswers using prompts for predicting sub-clauses. Thus, SeqZero avoids\ngenerating a long canonical utterance at once. Moreover, SeqZero employs not\nonly a few-shot model but also a zero-shot model to alleviate the overfitting.\nIn particular, SeqZero brings out the merits from both models via ensemble\nequipped with our proposed constrained rescaling. SeqZero achieves SOTA\nperformance of BART-based models on GeoQuery and EcommerceQuery, which are two\nfew-shot datasets with compositional data split.",

Sibyl observes different\nfeatures of the running workload as well as the storage devices to make\nsystem-aware data placement decisions.

We present this problem space in terms of technical,\nsociotechnical, and social problems, and illustrate examples of each for the\ntransport system components of social mobility, public infrastructure, and\nenvironmental impacts. The resulting research methodology sketches a path for\ndevelopers to incorporate and evaluate more transportation system features\nwithin AV system components over time.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, learning-based image registration methods have gradually\nmoved away from direct supervision with target warps to instead use\nself-supervision, with excellent results in several registration benchmarks.\nThese approaches utilize a loss function that penalizes the intensity\ndifferences between the fixed and moving images, along with a suitable\nregularizer on the deformation. In this paper, we argue that the relative\nfailure of supervised registration approaches can in part be blamed on the use\nof regular U-Nets, which are jointly tasked with feature extraction, feature\nmatching, and estimation of deformation. We introduce one simple but crucial\nmodification to the U-Net that disentangles feature extraction and matching\nfrom deformation prediction, allowing the U-Net to warp the features, across\nlevels, as the deformation field is evolved. With this modification, direct\nsupervision using target warps begins to outperform self-supervision approaches\nthat require segmentations, presenting new directions for registration when\nimages do not have segmentations. We hope that our findings in this preliminary\nworkshop paper will re-ignite research interest in supervised image\nregistration techniques.

Recent top-performing 3D object detectors mainly rely\non point-based or 3D voxel-based convolutions, which are both computationally\ninefficient for onboard deployment. In contrast, pillar-based methods use\nmerely 2D convolutions, which consume less computation resources, but they lag\nfar behind their voxel-based counterparts in detection accuracy. In this paper,\nby examining the primary performance gap between pillar- and voxel-based\ndetectors, we develop a real-time and high-performance pillar-based detector,\ndubbed PillarNet. The proposed PillarNet consists of a powerful encoder network\nfor effective pillar feature learning, a neck network for spatial-semantic\nfeature fusion and the commonly used detect head. Using only 2D convolutions,\nPillarNet is flexible to an optional pillar size and compatible with classical\n2D CNN backbones, such as VGGNet and ResNet. Additionally, PillarNet benefits\nfrom an orientation-decoupled IoU regression loss along with the IoU-aware\nprediction branch.

In\ncorrespondence-based point cloud registration, matching correspondences by\npoint feature techniques may lead to an extremely high outlier ratio.

The presented method could achieve fast and\naccurate outliers removal along with gradual aligning parameters estimation.\nExtensive experiments on simulations and challenging real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method can still perform effective point cloud\nregistration even the correspondence outlier ratio is over 99%, and the\nefficiency is better than the state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "In recent years, Transformer models have been proven to have the remarkable\nability of long-range dependencies modeling. They have achieved satisfactory\nresults both in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and image processing. This\nsignificant achievement sparks great interest among researchers in 3D point\ncloud processing to apply them to various 3D tasks. Due to the inherent\npermutation invariance and strong global feature learning ability, 3D\nTransformers are well suited for point cloud processing and analysis.

This survey aims to provide a\ncomprehensive overview of 3D Transformers designed for various tasks (e.g.\npoint cloud classification, segmentation, object detection, and so on). We\nstart by introducing the fundamental components of the general Transformer and\nproviding a brief description of its application in 2D and 3D fields. Then, we\npresent three different taxonomies (i.e., Transformer implementation-based\ntaxonomy, data representation-based taxonomy, and task-based taxonomy) for\nmethod classification, which allows us to analyze involved methods from\nmultiple perspectives. Furthermore, we also conduct an investigation of 3D\nself-attention mechanism variants designed for performance improvement. To\ndemonstrate the superiority of 3D Transformers, we compare the performance of\nTransformer-based algorithms in terms of point cloud classification,\nsegmentation, and object detection.

However, no comprehensive\ninvestigation for learning difficulty is available to date, resulting in that\nnearly all existing measures are heuristically defined without a rigorous\ntheoretical foundation. In addition, there is no formal definition of easy and\nhard samples even though they are crucial in many studies. This study attempts\nto conduct a pilot theoretical study for learning difficulty of samples. First,\na theoretical definition of learning difficulty is proposed on the basis of the\nbias-variance trade-off theory on generalization error. Theoretical definitions\nof easy and hard samples are established on the basis of the proposed\ndefinition. A practical measure of learning difficulty is given as well\ninspired by the formal definition. Second, the properties for learning\ndifficulty-based weighting strategies are explored. Subsequently, several\nclassical weighting methods in machine learning can be well explained on\naccount of explored properties. Third, the proposed measure is evaluated to\nverify its reasonability and superiority in terms of several main difficulty\nfactors.

    "abstract": "We investigate the role of the optimizer in determining the quality of the\nmodel fit for neural networks with a small to medium number of parameters. We\nstudy the performance of Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based\noptimization that uses adaptive momentum, the Levenberg and Marquardt (LM)\nalgorithm a second order method, Broyden,Fletcher,Goldfarb and Shanno algorithm\n(BFGS) a second order method and LBFGS, a low memory version of BFGS. Using\nthese optimizers we fit the function y = sinc(10x) using a neural network with\na few parameters. This function has a variable amplitude and a constant\nfrequency. We observe that the higher amplitude components of the function are\nfitted first and the Adam, BFGS and LBFGS struggle to fit the lower amplitude\ncomponents of the function. We also solve the Burgers equation using a physics\ninformed neural network(PINN) with the BFGS and LM optimizers. For our example\nproblems with a small to medium number of weights, we find that the LM\nalgorithm is able to rapidly converge to machine precision offering significant\nbenefits over other optimizers. We further investigated the Adam optimizer with\na range of models and found that Adam optimiser requires much deeper models\nwith large numbers of hidden units containing up to 26x more parameters, in\norder to achieve a model fit close that achieved by the LM optimizer. The LM\noptimizer results illustrate that it may be possible build models with far\nfewer parameters. We have implemented all our methods in Keras and TensorFlow\n2.",

    "abstract": "Binary neural network leverages the $Sign$ function to binarize real values,\nand its non-derivative property inevitably brings huge gradient errors during\nbackpropagation. Although many hand-designed soft functions have been proposed\nto approximate gradients, their mechanism is not clear and there are still huge\nperformance gaps between binary models and their full-precision counterparts.\nTo address this, we propose to tackle network binarization as a binary\nclassification problem and use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as the\nclassifier. The MLP-based classifier can fit any continuous function\ntheoretically and is adaptively learned to binarize networks and backpropagate\ngradients without any specific soft function. With this view, we further prove\nexperimentally that even a simple linear function can outperform previous\ncomplex soft functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod yields surprising performance both in image classification and human\npose estimation tasks. Specifically, we achieve 65.7% top-1 accuracy of\nResNet-34 on ImageNet dataset, with an absolute improvement of 2.8%. When\nevaluating on the challenging Microsoft COCO keypoint dataset, the proposed\nmethod enables binary networks to achieve a mAP of 60.6 for the first time, on\npar with some full-precision methods.",

    "abstract": "Deep-learning-based local feature extraction algorithms that combine\ndetection and description have made significant progress in visible image\nmatching. However, the end-to-end training of such frameworks is notoriously\nunstable due to the lack of strong supervision of detection and the\ninappropriate coupling between detection and description. The problem is\nmagnified in cross-modal scenarios, in which most methods heavily rely on the\npre-training. In this paper, we recouple independent constraints of detection\nand description of multimodal feature learning with a mutual weighting\nstrategy, in which the detected probabilities of robust features are forced to\npeak and repeat, while features with high detection scores are emphasized\nduring optimization. Different from previous works, those weights are detached\nfrom back propagation so that the detected probability of indistinct features\nwould not be directly suppressed and the training would be more stable.\nMoreover, we propose the Super Detector, a detector that possesses a large\nreceptive field and is equipped with learnable non-maximum suppression layers,\nto fulfill the harsh terms of detection. Finally, we build a benchmark that\ncontains cross visible, infrared, near-infrared and synthetic aperture radar\nimage pairs for evaluating the performance of features in feature matching and\nimage registration tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that features\ntrained with the recoulped detection and description, named ReDFeat, surpass\nprevious state-of-the-arts in the benchmark, while the model can be readily\ntrained from scratch.",

The freshness of information available at each\nmonitor is quantified in terms of the Age of Information (AoI), and the vector\nof AoI processes at the monitors (or equivalently the age vector) models the\ncontinuous state of the system. While the marginal distributional properties of\neach AoI process have been studied for a variety of settings using the\nstochastic hybrid system (SHS) approach, we lack a counterpart of this approach\nto systematically study their joint distributional properties. Developing such\na framework is the main contribution of this paper. In particular, we model the\ndiscrete state of the system as a finite-state continuous-time Markov chain,\nand describe the coupled evolution of the system's continuous and discrete\nstates by a piecewise linear SHS with linear reset maps. We start our analysis\nby deriving first-order linear differential equations for the temporal\nevolution of both the joint moments and the joint moment generating function\n(MGF) of all possible pairwise combinations formed by the age vector\ncomponents. We then derive the conditions under which the derived differential\nequations are asymptotically stable.

    "abstract": "Implicit deep learning has recently become popular in the machine learning\ncommunity since these implicit models can achieve competitive performance with\nstate-of-the-art deep networks while using significantly less memory and\ncomputational resources. However, our theoretical understanding of when and how\nfirst-order methods such as gradient descent (GD) converge on\n\\textit{nonlinear} implicit networks is limited. Although this type of problem\nhas been studied in standard feed-forward networks, the case of implicit models\nis still intriguing because implicit networks have \\textit{infinitely} many\nlayers.

This paper studies the convergence of both gradient\nflow (GF) and gradient descent for nonlinear ReLU activated implicit networks.\nTo deal with the well-posedness problem, we introduce a fixed scalar to scale\nthe weight matrix of the implicit layer and show that there exists a small\nenough scaling constant, keeping the equilibrium equation well-posed throughout\ntraining. As a result, we prove that both GF and GD converge to a global\nminimum at a linear rate if the width $m$ of the implicit network is\n\\textit{linear} in the sample size $N$, i.e., $m=\\Omega(N)$.",

    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based models are vulnerable to the\nadversarial attacks. One of the possible reasons is that the embedding space of\nCNN based model is sparse, resulting in a large space for the generation of\nadversarial samples. In this study, we propose a method, denoted as Dynamic\nFeature Aggregation, to compress the embedding space with a novel\nregularization. Particularly, the convex combination between two samples are\nregarded as the pivot for aggregation. In the embedding space, the selected\nsamples are guided to be similar to the representation of the pivot. On the\nother side, to mitigate the trivial solution of such regularization, the last\nfully-connected layer of the model is replaced by an orthogonal classifier, in\nwhich the embedding codes for different classes are processed orthogonally and\nseparately. With the regularization and orthogonal classifier, a more compact\nembedding space can be obtained, which accordingly improves the model\nrobustness against adversarial attacks. An averaging accuracy of 56.91% is\nachieved by our method on CIFAR-10 against various attack methods, which\nsignificantly surpasses a solid baseline (Mixup) by a margin of 37.31%. More\nsurprisingly, empirical results show that, the proposed method can also achieve\nthe state-of-the-art performance for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, due\nto the learned compact feature space.

Though significant improvement\nhas been shown with the Boltzmann softmax policy, when the Tsallis sparsemax\npolicy is considered, the augmentation leads to a flat learning curve for\nalmost every problem considered.

Drawing inspiration from the Tsallis statistics literature, we\npropose to correct the mismatch of M-RL with the help of\n$q$-logarithm/exponential functions.

    "abstract": "Spiking neural network (SNN) operating with asynchronous discrete events\nshows higher energy efficiency. A popular approach to implement deep SNNs is\nANN-SNN conversion combining both efficient training in ANNs and efficient\ninference in SNNs. However, the previous works mostly required thousands of\ntime steps to achieve lossless conversion. In this paper, we first identify the\nunderlying cause, i.e., misrepresentation of the negative or overflow residual\nmembrane potential in SNNs. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the\nconversion error between SNNs and ANNs, and then decompose it into three folds:\nquantization error, clipping error, and residual membrane potential\nrepresentation error. With such insights, we propose a dual-phase conversion\nalgorithm to minimize those errors. As a result, our model achieves SOTA in\nboth accuracy and accuracy-delay tradeoff with deep architectures (ResNet and\nVGG net). Specifically, we report SOTA accuracy within 16$\\times$ speedup\ncompared with the latest results. Meanwhile, lossless conversion is performed\nwith at least 2$\\times$ faster reasoning performance.",

The\noverall objective of the AI-DO is to provide accessible mechanisms for\nbenchmarking progress in autonomy applied to the task of autonomous driving.\nThe tricky section of this challenge was the sim2real transfer of the learned\nskills. To reduce the domain gap in the observation space we did a canny edge\ndetection in addition to cropping out of the unnecessary background\ninformation. We modeled the problem as a behavioral cloning task and used\nMLP-MIXER to optimize for runtime. We made sure our model was capable of\nhandling control noise by careful filtration of the training data and that gave\nus a robust model capable of completing the track even when 50% of the commands\nwere randomly changed.

For instance, product quality is a confounder since\naffecting both item prices and user ratings, but is hidden for the third-party\ne-commerce platform due to the difficulty of large-scale quality inspection;\nignoring it could result in the bias effect of over-recommending high-price\nitems. This work analyzes and addresses the problem from a causal perspective.\nThe key lies in modeling the causal effect of item features on a user's\nfeedback. To mitigate hidden confounding effects, it is compulsory but\nchallenging to estimate the causal effect without measuring the confounder.\nTowards this goal, we propose a Hidden Confounder Removal (HCR) framework that\nleverages front-door adjustment to decompose the causal effect into two partial\neffects, according to the mediators between item features and user feedback.\nThe partial effects are independent from the hidden confounder and\nidentifiable. During training, HCR performs multi-task learning to infer the\npartial effects from historical interactions.

    "title": "Residual Local Feature Network for Efficient Super-Resolution",
    "abstract": "Deep learning based approaches has achieved great performance in single image\nsuper-resolution (SISR). However, recent advances in efficient super-resolution\nfocus on reducing the number of parameters and FLOPs, and they aggregate more\npowerful features by improving feature utilization through complex layer\nconnection strategies. These structures may not be necessary to achieve higher\nrunning speed, which makes them difficult to be deployed to\nresource-constrained devices. In this work, we propose a novel Residual Local\nFeature Network (RLFN). The main idea is using three convolutional layers for\nresidual local feature learning to simplify feature aggregation, which achieves\na good trade-off between model performance and inference time. Moreover, we\nrevisit the popular contrastive loss and observe that the selection of\nintermediate features of its feature extractor has great influence on the\nperformance. Besides, we propose a novel multi-stage warm-start training\nstrategy. In each stage, the pre-trained weights from previous stages are\nutilized to improve the model performance. Combined with the improved\ncontrastive loss and training strategy, the proposed RLFN outperforms all the\nstate-of-the-art efficient image SR models in terms of runtime while\nmaintaining both PSNR and SSIM for SR. In addition, we won the first place in\nthe runtime track of the NTIRE 2022 efficient super-resolution challenge. Code\nwill be available at https://github.com/fyan111/RLFN.",

    "abstract": "One of the key benefits of virtualized radio access networks (vRANs) is\nnetwork management flexibility. However, this versatility raises\npreviously-unseen network management challenges. In this paper, a\nlearning-based zero-touch vRAN orchestration framework (LOFV) is proposed to\njointly select the functional splits and allocate the virtualized resources to\nminimize the long-term management cost. First, testbed measurements of the\nbehaviour between the users' demand and the virtualized resource utilization\nare collected using a centralized RAN system. The collected data reveals that\nthere are non-linear and non-monotonic relationships between demand and\nresource utilization. Then, a comprehensive cost model is proposed that takes\nresource overprovisioning, declined demand, instantiation and reconfiguration\ninto account. Moreover, the proposed cost model also captures different routing\nand computing costs for each split. Motivated by our measurement insights and\ncost model, LOFV is developed using a model-free reinforcement learning\nparadigm. The proposed solution is constructed from a combination of deep\nQ-learning and a regression-based neural network that maps the network state\nand users' demand into split and resource control decisions. Our numerical\nevaluations show that LOFV can offer cost savings by up to 69\\% of the optimal\nstatic policy and 45\\% of the optimal fully dynamic policy.",

The classical Eulerian\ndiscretization based approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which\narises from the approximation of high-dimensional velocity field. In this work,\nwe propose a deep learning based method to solve the dynamic optimal transport\nin high dimensional space. Our method contains three main ingredients: a\ncarefully designed representation of the velocity field, the discretization of\nthe PDE constraint along the characteristics, and the computation of high\ndimensional integral by Monte Carlo method in each time step. Specifically, in\nthe representation of the velocity field, we apply the classical nodal basis\nfunction in time and the deep neural networks in space domain with the H1-norm\nregularization. This technique promotes the regularity of the velocity field in\nboth time and space such that the discretization along the characteristic\nremains to be stable during the training process. Extensive numerical examples\nhave been conducted to test the proposed method. Compared to other solvers of\noptimal transport, our method could give more accurate results in high\ndimensional cases and has very good scalability with respect to dimension.\nFinally, we extend our method to more complicated cases such as crowd motion\nproblem.",

    "abstract": "Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) conducts knowledge distillation via\neliminating the dependence of original training data, and has recently achieved\nimpressive results in accelerating pre-trained language models. At the heart of\nDFKD is to reconstruct a synthetic dataset by inverting the parameters of the\nuncompressed model. Prior DFKD approaches, however, have largely relied on\nhand-crafted priors of the target data distribution for the reconstruction,\nwhich can be inevitably biased and often incompetent to capture the intrinsic\ndistributions. To address this problem, we propose a prompt-based method,\ntermed as PromptDFD, that allows us to take advantage of learned language\npriors, which effectively harmonizes the synthetic sentences to be semantically\nand grammatically correct. Specifically, PromptDFD leverages a pre-trained\ngenerative model to provide language priors and introduces a reinforced topic\nprompter to control data synthesis, making the generated samples thematically\nrelevant and semantically plausible, and thus friendly to downstream tasks. As\nshown in our experiments, the proposed method substantially improves the\nsynthesis quality and achieves considerable improvements on distillation\nperformance.

With the increase in computational resources and\nstorage capacities in these fields, high-dimensional and large-scale problems\nare becoming increasingly common. In this study, we propose a model aggregation\nmethod in the Bayesian optimization (MamBO) algorithm for efficiently solving\nhigh-dimensional large-scale optimization problems. MamBO uses a combination of\nsubsampling and subspace embeddings to collectively address high dimensionality\nand large-scale issues; in addition, a model aggregation method is employed to\naddress the surrogate model uncertainty issue that arises when embedding is\napplied. This surrogate model uncertainty issue is largely ignored in the\nembedding literature and practice, and it is exacerbated when the problem is\nhigh-dimensional and data are limited. Our proposed model aggregation method\nreduces these lower-dimensional surrogate model risks and improves the\nrobustness of the BO algorithm. We derive an asymptotic bound for the proposed\naggregated surrogate model and prove the convergence of MamBO. Benchmark\nnumerical experiments indicate that our algorithm achieves superior or\ncomparable performance to other commonly used high-dimensional BO algorithms.\nMoreover, we apply MamBO to a cascade classifier of a machine learning\nalgorithm for face detection, and the results reveal that MamBO finds settings\nthat achieve higher classification accuracy than the benchmark settings and is\ncomputationally faster than other high-dimensional BO algorithms.",

To\ninvestigate the concept behind code smells identified in modern code review and\nwhat actions reviewers suggest and developers take in response to the\nidentified smells, we conducted a study of code smells in code reviews by\nanalyzing reviews from four large open source projects from the OpenStack (Nova\nand Neutron) and Qt (Qt Base and Qt Creator) communities. We manually checked a\ntotal of 25,415 code review comments obtained by keywords search and random\nselection, and identified 1,539 smell-related reviews. Our analysis found that\n1) code smells were not commonly identified in code reviews, 2) smells were\nusually caused by violation of coding conventions, 3) reviewers usually\nprovided constructive feedback, including fixing (refactoring) recommendations\nto help developers remove smells, 4) developers generally followed those\nrecommendations and actioned the changes, 5) once identified by reviewers, it\nusually takes developers less than one week to fix the smells, and 6) the main\nreason why developers chose to ignore the identified smells is not worth fixing\nthe smell. Our results suggest that: 1) developers should closely follow coding\nconventions in their projects to avoid introducing code smells, 2) review-based\ndetection of code smells is perceived to be a trustworthy approach by\ndevelopers, mainly because reviews are context-sensitive (as reviewers are more\naware of the context of the code given that they are part of the project's\ndevelopment team), and 3) program context needs to be fully considered in order\nto make a decision of whether to fix the identified code smell immediately.",

However, existing CRL methods constraining discounted\ncumulative costs generally lack rigorous definition and guarantee of safety. On\nthe other hand, in the safe control research, safety is defined as persistently\nsatisfying certain state constraints. Such persistent safety is possible only\non a subset of the state space, called feasible set, where an optimal largest\nfeasible set exists for a given environment. Recent studies incorporating safe\ncontrol with CRL using energy-based methods such as control barrier function\n(CBF), safety index (SI) leverage prior conservative estimation of feasible\nsets, which harms performance of the learned policy. To deal with this problem,\nthis paper proposes a reachability CRL (RCRL) method by using reachability\nanalysis to characterize the largest feasible sets. We characterize the\nfeasible set by the established self-consistency condition, then a safety value\nfunction can be learned and used as constraints in CRL. We also use the\nmulti-time scale stochastic approximation theory to prove that the proposed\nalgorithm converges to a local optimum, where the largest feasible set can be\nguaranteed. Empirical results on different benchmarks such as safe-control-gym\nand Safety-Gym validate the learned feasible set, the performance in optimal\ncriteria, and constraint satisfaction of RCRL, compared to state-of-the-art CRL\nbaselines.",

Decomposition aims to split\nhighly complex scheduling tasks into better manageable sub-problems with a\nbalanced number of operations so that good quality or even optimal partial\nsolutions can be reliably found in a small fraction of runtime. Problem\ndecomposition must respect the precedence of operations within their jobs and\npartial schedules optimized by time windows should yield better global\nsolutions than obtainable in similar runtime on the entire instance. We devise\nand investigate a variety of decomposition strategies in terms of the number\nand size of time windows as well as heuristics for choosing their operations.\nMoreover, we incorporate time window overlapping and compression techniques\ninto the iterative scheduling process to counteract window-wise optimization\nlimitations restricted to partial schedules. Our experiments on JSP benchmark\nsets of several sizes show that successive optimization by multi-shot ASP\nsolving leads to substantially better schedules within the runtime limit than\nglobal optimization on the full problem, where the gap increases with the\nnumber of operations to schedule.

    "abstract": "We present novel techniques for neuro-symbolic concurrent stochastic games, a\nrecently proposed modelling formalism to represent a set of agents operating in\na probabilistic, continuous-space environment using a combination of neural\nnetwork based perception mechanisms and traditional symbolic methods. To date,\nonly zero-sum variants of the model were studied, which is too restrictive when\nagents have distinct objectives. We formalise notions of equilibria for these\nmodels and present algorithms to synthesise them. Focusing on the\nfinite-horizon setting, and (global) social welfare subgame-perfect optimality,\nwe consider two distinct types: Nash equilibria and correlated equilibria. We\nfirst show that an exact solution based on backward induction may yield\narbitrarily bad equilibria. We then propose an approximation algorithm called\nfrozen subgame improvement, which proceeds through iterative solution of\nnonlinear programs. We develop a prototype implementation and demonstrate the\nbenefits of our approach on two case studies: an automated car-parking system\nand an aircraft collision avoidance system.",

    "abstract": "One noted issue of vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is that\nthe learned discrete representation uses only a fraction of the full capacity\nof the codebook, also known as codebook collapse. We hypothesize that the\ntraining scheme of VQ-VAE, which involves some carefully designed heuristics,\nunderlies this issue. In this paper, we propose a new training scheme that\nextends the standard VAE via novel stochastic dequantization and quantization,\ncalled stochastically quantized variational autoencoder (SQ-VAE). In SQ-VAE, we\nobserve a trend that the quantization is stochastic at the initial stage of the\ntraining but gradually converges toward a deterministic quantization, which we\ncall self-annealing. Our experiments show that SQ-VAE improves codebook\nutilization without using common heuristics. Furthermore, we empirically show\nthat SQ-VAE is superior to VAE and VQ-VAE in vision- and speech-related tasks.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous open-ended learning is a relevant approach in machine learning and\nrobotics, allowing the design of artificial agents able to acquire goals and\nmotor skills without the necessity of user assigned tasks. A crucial issue for\nthis approach is to develop strategies to ensure that agents can maximise their\ncompetence on as many tasks as possible in the shortest possible time.\nIntrinsic motivations have proven to generate a task-agnostic signal to\nproperly allocate the training time amongst goals. While the majority of works\nin the field of intrinsically motivated open-ended learning focus on scenarios\nwhere goals are independent from each other, only few of them studied the\nautonomous acquisition of interdependent tasks, and even fewer tackled\nscenarios where goals involve non-stationary interdependencies. Building on\nprevious works, we tackle these crucial issues at the level of decision making\n(i.e., building strategies to properly select between goals), and we propose a\nhierarchical architecture that treating sub-tasks selection as a Markov\nDecision Process is able to properly learn interdependent skills on the basis\nof intrinsically generated motivations. In particular, we first deepen the\nanalysis of a previous system, showing the importance of incorporating\ninformation about the relationships between tasks at a higher level of the\narchitecture (that of goal selection). Then we introduce H-GRAIL, a new system\nthat extends the previous one by adding a new learning layer to store the\nautonomously acquired sequences of tasks to be able to modify them in case the\ninterdependencies are non-stationary.

We analyze how the methods differ with\nrespect to: (i) general efficacy, (ii) ability to cope with sparse rewards,\n(iii) propensity/capacity to discover minimal solutions, (iv) dependency on\nreward shaping, and (v) ability to cope with variations of the environmental\nconditions. The analysis of the performance and of the behavioral strategies\ndisplayed by the agents trained with the two methods on benchmark problems\nenable us to demonstrate qualitative differences which were not identified in\nprevious studies, to identify the relative weakness of the two methods, and to\npropose ways to ameliorate some of those weakness. We show that the\ncharacteristics of the reward function has a strong impact which vary\nqualitatively not only for the OpenAI-ES and the PPO but also for alternative\nreinforcement learning algorithms, thus demonstrating the importance of\noptimizing the characteristic of the reward function to the algorithm used.",

    "abstract": "Grouping together similar elements in datasets is a common task in data\nmining and machine learning. In this paper, we study parallel algorithms for\ncorrelation clustering, where each pair of items are labeled either similar or\ndissimilar. The task is to partition the elements and the objective is to\nminimize disagreements, that is, the number of dissimilar elements grouped\ntogether and similar elements grouped separately.\nOur main contribution is a parallel algorithm that achieves a $(3 +\n\\varepsilon)$-approximation to the minimum number of disagreements. Our\nalgorithm follows the design of the PIVOT algorithm by Ailon, Charikar and\nNewman [JACM'08] that obtains a $3$-approximation in the centralized setting.\nOur approach effectively reduces the problem to running several instances of\ncorrelation clustering on graphs with small maximum degree and hence, a small\namount of edges. This reduction makes our technique applicable on several\nmodels of massive graph processing, such as Massively Parallel Computing (MPC)\nand graph streaming.\nFor the linear memory models, such as the linear memory MPC and streaming,\nour approach yields $O(1)$ time algorithms, where the runtime is independent of\n$\\varepsilon$. In the low-space regime of MPC with strictly sublinear in $n$\nmemory per machine, we obtain an $O(\\log 1/\\varepsilon \\cdot \\mathrm{poly} \\log\n\\log n)$-round algorithm.",

In cell-free massive MIMO, a control unit dictates the baseband\nprocessing at a geographical scale, while the base stations communicate with\nthe control unit through fronthaul links. Unlike most of previous works in\ncell-free massive MIMO with finite-capacity fronthaul links, we consider the\ngeneral case where the fronthaul capacity and ADC/DAC resolution are not\nnecessarily the same. In particular, the fronthaul compression and ADC/DAC\nquantization occur independently where each one is modeled based on the\ninformation theoretic argument and additive quantization noise model (AQNM).\nThen, we address the codebook design problem that aims to minimize the channel\nestimation error for the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and\ncolored compression noise cases. Also, we propose an alternating optimization\n(AO) method to tackle the max-min fairness problem. In essence, the AO method\nalternates between two subproblems that correspond to the power allocation and\ncodebook design problems. The AO method proposed for the zero-forcing (ZF)\nprecoder is guaranteed to converge, whereas the one for the maximum ratio\ntransmission (MRT) precoder has no such guarantee. Finally, the performance of\nthe proposed schemes is evaluated by the simulation results in terms of both\nenergy and spectral efficiency. The numerical results show that the proposed\nscheme for the ZF precoder yields spectral and energy efficiency 28% and 15%\nhigher than that of the best baseline.",

However,\ncurrent state-of-the-art approaches are not able to leverage the massively\nparallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs with close-to-peak performance.\nWe present AnySeq/GPU-a sequence alignment library that augments the AnySeq1\nlibrary with a novel approach for accelerating dynamic programming (DP)\nalignment on GPUs by minimizing memory accesses using warp shuffles and\nhalf-precision arithmetic. Our implementation is based on the AnyDSL compiler\nframework which allows for convenient zero-cost abstractions through guaranteed\npartial evaluation.

    "abstract": "Recently, video recognition is emerging with the help of multi-modal\nlearning, which focuses on integrating multiple modalities to improve the\nperformance or robustness of a model. Although various multi-modal learning\nmethods have been proposed and offer remarkable recognition results, almost all\nof these methods rely on high-quality manual annotations and assume that\nmodalities among multi-modal data provide relevant semantic information.\nUnfortunately, most widely used video datasets are collected from the Internet\nand inevitably contain noisy labels and noisy correspondence. To solve this\nproblem, we use the audio-visual action recognition task as a proxy and propose\na noise-tolerant learning framework to find anti-interference model parameters\nto both noisy labels and noisy correspondence. Our method consists of two\nphases and aims to rectify noise by the inherent correlation between\nmodalities. A noise-tolerant contrastive training phase is performed first to\nlearn robust model parameters unaffected by the noisy labels. To reduce the\ninfluence of noisy correspondence, we propose a cross-modal noise estimation\ncomponent to adjust the consistency between different modalities. Since the\nnoisy correspondence existed at the instance level, a category-level\ncontrastive loss is proposed to further alleviate the interference of noisy\ncorrespondence. Then in the hybrid supervised training phase, we calculate the\ndistance metric among features to obtain corrected labels, which are used as\ncomplementary supervision. In addition, we investigate the noisy correspondence\nin real-world datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments with synthetic and\nreal noise data. The results verify the advantageous performance of our method\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods.",

In this work, we adopt a principled way and\nstudy the robustness of DRL policies to adversarial attacks from the\nperspective of robust optimization. Within the framework of robust\noptimization, optimal adversarial attacks are given by minimizing the expected\nreturn of the policy, and correspondingly a good defense mechanism should be\nrealized by improving the worst-case performance of the policy.

Experiments on Atari game\nenvironments show that our attack algorithm is more effective and leads to\nworse return of the policy than existing attack algorithms, and our defense\nalgorithm yields policies more robust than existing defense methods to a range\nof adversarial attacks (including our proposed attack algorithm).",

    "abstract": "Intent detection and slot filling are two main tasks in natural language\nunderstanding and play an essential role in task-oriented dialogue systems. The\njoint learning of both tasks can improve inference accuracy and is popular in\nrecent works. However, most joint models ignore the inference latency and\ncannot meet the need to deploy dialogue systems at the edge. In this paper, we\npropose a Fast Attention Network (FAN) for joint intent detection and slot\nfilling tasks, guaranteeing both accuracy and latency. Specifically, we\nintroduce a clean and parameter-refined attention module to enhance the\ninformation exchange between intent and slot, improving semantic accuracy by\nmore than 2%. FAN can be implemented on different encoders and delivers more\naccurate models at every speed level. Our experiments on the Jetson Nano\nplatform show that FAN inferences fifteen utterances per second with a small\naccuracy drop, showing its effectiveness and efficiency on edge devices.",

    "title": "Pareto-Optimal Fairness-Utility Amortizations in Rankings with a DBN  Exposure Model",
    "abstract": "In recent years, it has become clear that rankings delivered in many areas\nneed not only be useful to the users but also respect fairness of exposure for\nthe item producers. We consider the problem of finding ranking policies that\nachieve a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between these two aspects. Several methods\nwere proposed to solve it; for instance a popular one is to use linear\nprogramming with a Birkhoff-von Neumann decomposition. These methods, however,\nare based on a classical Position Based exposure Model (PBM), which assumes\nindependence between the items (hence the exposure only depends on the rank).\nIn many applications, this assumption is unrealistic and the community\nincreasingly moves towards considering other models that include dependences,\nsuch as the Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) exposure model. For such models,\ncomputing (exact) optimal fair ranking policies remains an open question.\nWe answer this question by leveraging a new geometrical method based on the\nso-called expohedron proposed recently for the PBM (Kletti et al., WSDM'22). We\nlay out the structure of a new geometrical object (the DBN-expohedron), and\npropose for it a Carath\\'eodory decomposition algorithm of complexity $O(n^3)$,\nwhere $n$ is the number of documents to rank. Such an algorithm enables\nexpressing any feasible expected exposure vector as a distribution over at most\n$n$ rankings; furthermore we show that we can compute the whole set of\nPareto-optimal expected exposure vectors with the same complexity $O(n^3)$. Our\nwork constitutes the first exact algorithm able to efficiently find a\nPareto-optimal distribution of rankings. It is applicable to a broad range of\nfairness notions, including classical notions of meritocratic and demographic\nfairness. We empirically evaluate our method on the TREC2020 and MSLR datasets\nand compare it to several baselines in terms of Pareto-optimality and speed.",

    "abstract": "Domain generalization aims to improve the generalization capability of\nmachine learning systems to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing domain\ngeneralization techniques embark upon stationary and discrete environments to\ntackle the generalization issue caused by OOD data. However, many real-world\ntasks in non-stationary environments (e.g. self-driven car system, sensor\nmeasures) involve more complex and continuously evolving domain drift, which\nraises new challenges for the problem of domain generalization. In this paper,\nwe formulate the aforementioned setting as the problem of evolving domain\ngeneralization. Specifically, we propose to introduce a probabilistic framework\ncalled Latent Structure-aware Sequential Autoencoder (LSSAE) to tackle the\nproblem of evolving domain generalization via exploring the underlying\ncontinuous structure in the latent space of deep neural networks, where we aim\nto identify two major factors namely covariate shift and concept shift\naccounting for distribution shift in non-stationary environments. Experimental\nresults on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that LSSAE can lead to\nsuperior performances based on the evolving domain generalization setting.",

Currently, ambulatory\nassessment of couples' interactions entails collecting data at random or\nscheduled times which could miss significant couples' interaction/conversation\nmoments. In this work, we developed, deployed and evaluated DyMand, a novel\nopen-source smartwatch and smartphone system for collecting self-report and\nsensor data from couples based on partners' interaction moments. Our\nsmartwatch-based algorithm uses the Bluetooth signal strength between two\nsmartwatches each worn by one partner, and a voice activity detection\nmachine-learning algorithm to infer that the partners are interacting, and then\nto trigger data collection. We deployed the DyMand system in a 7-day field\nstudy and collected data about social support, emotional well-being, and health\nbehavior from 13 (N=26) Swiss-based heterosexual couples managing diabetes\nmellitus type 2 of one partner. Our system triggered 99.1% of the expected\nnumber of sensor and self-report data when the app was running, and 77.6% of\nalgorithm-triggered recordings contained partners' conversation moments\ncompared to 43.8% for scheduled triggers. The usability evaluation showed that\nDyMand was easy to use. DyMand can be used by social, clinical, or health\npsychology researchers to understand the social dynamics of couples in everyday\nlife, and for developing and delivering behavioral interventions for couples\nwho are managing chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "The ability to generalize to previously unseen tasks with little to no\nsupervision is a key challenge in modern machine learning research. It is also\na cornerstone of a future \"General AI\". Any artificially intelligent agent\ndeployed in a real world application, must adapt on the fly to unknown\nenvironments. Researchers often rely on reinforcement and imitation learning to\nprovide online adaptation to new tasks, through trial and error learning.\nHowever, this can be challenging for complex tasks which require many timesteps\nor large numbers of subtasks to complete. These \"long horizon\" tasks suffer\nfrom sample inefficiency and can require extremely long training times before\nthe agent can learn to perform the necessary longterm planning. In this work,\nwe introduce CASE which attempts to address these issues by training an\nImitation Learning agent using adaptive \"near future\" subgoals. These subgoals\nare recalculated at each step using compositional arithmetic in a learned\nlatent representation space. In addition to improving learning efficiency for\nstandard long-term tasks, this approach also makes it possible to perform\none-shot generalization to previously unseen tasks, given only a single\nreference trajectory for the task in a different environment. Our experiments\nshow that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art compositional Imitation Learning approach by 30%.",

    "abstract": "Robust motion planning entails computing a global motion plan that is safe\nunder all possible uncertainty realizations, be it in the system dynamics, the\nrobot's initial position, or with respect to external disturbances. Current\napproaches for robust motion planning either lack theoretical guarantees, or\nmake restrictive assumptions on the system dynamics and uncertainty\ndistributions. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing the\nrobust rapidly-exploring random-tree (Robust-RRT) algorithm, which integrates\nforward reachability analysis directly into sampling-based control trajectory\nsynthesis. We prove that Robust-RRT is probabilistically complete (PC) for\nnonlinear Lipschitz continuous dynamical systems with bounded uncertainty. In\nother words, Robust-RRT eventually finds a robust motion plan that is feasible\nunder all possible uncertainty realizations assuming such a plan exists. Our\nanalysis applies even to unstable systems that admit only short-horizon\nfeasible plans; this is because we explicitly consider the time evolution of\nreachable sets along control trajectories. Thanks to the explicit consideration\nof time dependency in our analysis, PC applies to unstabilizable systems. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the most general PC proof for robust\nsampling-based motion planning, in terms of the types of uncertainties and\ndynamical systems it can handle. Considering that an exact computation of\nreachable sets can be computationally expensive for some dynamical systems, we\nincorporate sampling-based reachability analysis into Robust-RRT and\ndemonstrate our robust planner on nonlinear, underactuated, and hybrid systems.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a class of machine learning methods called physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs) has been proposed and gained great prevalence in solving\nvarious scientific computing problems. This approach enables the solution of\npartial differential equations (PDEs) via embedding physical laws into the loss\nfunction of neural networks. Many inverse problems can also be tackled by\nsimply combining the observational data from real life scenarios with existing\nPINN algorithms. In this paper, we present a multi-task learning method to\nimprove the training stability of PINNs for linear elastic problems, and the\nhomoscedastic uncertainty is introduced as a basis for weighting losses.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate an application of PINNs to a practical inverse\nproblem in tunnel engineering: prediction of external loading distributions of\ntunnel rings based on a limited number of displacement monitoring points. To\nthis end, we first determine a simplified tunneling scenario at the offline\nstage. By setting unknown boundary conditions as learnable parameters, PINNs\ncan predict the external loads applied on the tunnel lining with the support of\nenough measurement data. When it comes to the online stage in real tunnel\nprojects, the Kriging method is adopted to reconstruct the whole displacement\nfield based on very limited measurements. Then transfer learning is employed to\nfine-tune the pre-trained model from offline stage. Our results show that,\nalthough the reconstructed displacement field generated from gappy measurements\nis accompanied by errors, satisfactory results can still be obtained from the\nPINN model due to the dual regularization of physics laws and prior knowledge,\nwhich exhibits better robustness compared to traditional analysis methods. The\nconvergence of training is also accelerated, thus making it possible for PINNs\nto be applied in actual tunnel projects.",

Concretely, we\nencode the abstract location of every data point as a finite-length binary\nstring, and the union of all binary strings is stored compactly using binary\ndecision diagrams (BDDs). We demonstrate how to use BDDs to symbolically\nextract corners distant from all data points within the training set.

We consider strategies where the vendor updates are\nthe only limiting factors to cases in which enterprises delay updates from 1 to\n7 months based on SANS data. Our manually curated dataset of APT attacks covers\n86 APTs and 350 campaigns from 2008 to 2020.

However, if attacked, it could still be compromised from\n14% to 33% of the times.

These filters rely on measurements from an\nInertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and relative forward kinematics for estimating\nthe base position-and-orientation and its linear velocity along with the\naugmented states of feet position-and-orientation, thus giving them their name,\nflat-foot filters. However, the availability of only partial measurements often\nposes the question of consistency in the filter design. In this paper, we\nperform an experimental comparison of state-of-the-art flat-foot filters based\non the representation choice of state, observation, matrix Lie group error and\nsystem dynamics evaluated for filter consistency and trajectory errors. The\ncomparison is performed over simulated and real-world experiments conducted on\nthe iCub humanoid platform.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of planning with participation constraints introduced\nin [Zhang et al., 2022]. In this problem, a principal chooses actions in a\nMarkov decision process, resulting in separate utilities for the principal and\nthe agent. However, the agent can and will choose to end the process whenever\nhis expected onward utility becomes negative. The principal seeks to compute\nand commit to a policy that maximizes her expected utility, under the\nconstraint that the agent should always want to continue participating. We\nprovide the first polynomial-time exact algorithm for this problem for\nfinite-horizon settings, where previously only an additive\n$\\varepsilon$-approximation algorithm was known. Our approach can also be\nextended to the (discounted) infinite-horizon case, for which we give an\nalgorithm that runs in time polynomial in the size of the input and\n$\\log(1/\\varepsilon)$, and returns a policy that is optimal up to an additive\nerror of $\\varepsilon$.",

Even if\nin each component of the free space the number of targets matches the number of\nstart positions, the motion-planning problem does not always have a solution\nwhen the robots and their targets are positioned very densely. In this paper,\nwe prove tight bounds on how much separation between start and target positions\nis necessary to always guarantee a solution. Moreover, we describe an algorithm\nthat always finds a solution in time $O(n \\log n + mn + m^2)$ if the separation\nbounds are met. Specifically, we prove that the following separation is\nsufficient: any two start positions are at least distance $4$ apart, any two\ntarget positions are at least distance $4$ apart, and any pair of a start and a\ntarget positions is at least distance $3$ apart.

In this paper,\nwe present Prisma, a language for tierless decentralized applications, where\nthe contract and its clients are defined in one unit and pairs of send and\nreceive actions that \"belong together\" are encapsulated into a single\ndirect-style operation, which is executed differently by sending and receiving\nparties. This enables expressing distributed program flow via standard control\nflow and renders mismatching communication impossible.

One common\ntheoretical approach to this problem is to model the task as a two-agent\ncooperative scheme in which a `speaker' agent would generate the expression\nthat best describes a targeted area and a `listener' agent would identify the\ntarget. Several recent REG systems have used deep learning approaches to\nrepresent the speaker/listener agents. The Rational Speech Act framework (RSA),\na Bayesian approach to pragmatics that can predict human linguistic behavior\nquite accurately, has been shown to generate high quality and explainable\nexpressions on toy datasets involving simple visual scenes. Its application to\nlarge scale problems, however, remains largely unexplored. This paper applies a\ncombination of the probabilistic RSA framework and deep learning approaches to\nlarger datasets involving complex visual scenes in a multi-step process with\nthe aim of generating better-explained expressions. We carry out experiments on\nthe RefCOCO and RefCOCO+ datasets and compare our approach with other\nend-to-end deep learning approaches as well as a variation of RSA to highlight\nour key contribution.

In that case, no such language is easy on\naverage (in $\\textbf{AvgP}$) for a distribution applying non-negligible weight\nto the hard families.\nThe hardness of proving tautologies and theorems is likely related. Motivated\nby the fact that arithmetic sentences encoding \"string $x$ is Kolmogorov\nrandom\" are true but unprovable with positive density in a finitely axiomatized\ntheory $\\mathcal{T}$ (Calude and J{\\\"u}rgensen), we conjecture that any\npropositional proof system requires superpolynomial size proofs for a dense set\nof $\\textbf{P}$-uniform families of tautologies encoding \"there is no\n$\\mathcal{T}$ proof of size $\\leq t$ showing that string $x$ is Kolmogorov\nrandom\".

The algorithm\ncomputes the $QR$ factorization of the matrix $B = [\\: {\\bf r}_0, AV_k\\:]$ at\neach iteration. Despite an $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon)\\kappa(B)$ loss of\northogonality, the modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) formulation was shown to be\nbackward stable in the seminal papers by Paige, et al.

    "title": "Switch as a Verifier: Toward Scalable Data Plane Checking via  Distributed, On-Device Verification",
    "abstract": "Data plane verification (DPV) is important for finding network errors.\nCurrent DPV tools employ a centralized architecture, where a server collects\nthe data planes of all devices and verifies them. Despite substantial efforts\non accelerating DPV, this centralized architecture is inherently unscalable. In\nthis paper, to tackle the scalability challenge of DPV, we circumvent the\nscalability bottleneck of centralized design and design Coral, a distributed,\non-device DPV framework. The key insight of Coral is that DPV can be\ntransformed into a counting problem on a directed acyclic graph, which can be\nnaturally decomposed into lightweight tasks executed at network devices,\nenabling scalability. Coral consists of (1) a declarative requirement\nspecification language, (2) a planner that employs a novel data structure DVNet\nto systematically decompose global verification into on-device counting tasks,\nand (3) a distributed verification (DV) protocol that specifies how on-device\nverifiers communicate task results efficiently to collaboratively verify the\nrequirements. We implement a prototype of Coral. Extensive experiments with\nreal-world datasets (WAN/LAN/DC) show that Coral consistently achieves scalable\nDPV under various networks and DPV scenarios, i.e., up to 1250 times speed up\nin the scenario of burst update, and up to 202 times speed up on 80% quantile\nof incremental verification, than state-of-the-art DPV tools, with little\noverhead on commodity network devices.",

    "abstract": "In satellite layout design, heat source layout optimization (HSLO) is an\neffective technique to decrease the maximum temperature and improve the heat\nmanagement of the whole system. Recently, deep learning surrogate assisted HSLO\nhas been proposed, which learns the mapping from layout to its corresponding\ntemperature field, so as to substitute the simulation during optimization to\ndecrease the computational cost largely. However, it faces two main challenges:\n1) the neural network surrogate for the certain task is often manually designed\nto be complex and requires rich debugging experience, which is challenging for\nthe designers in the engineering field; 2) existing algorithms for HSLO could\nonly obtain a near optimal solution in single optimization and are easily\ntrapped in local optimum. To address the first challenge, considering reducing\nthe total parameter numbers and ensuring the similar accuracy as well as, a\nneural architecture search (NAS) method combined with Feature Pyramid Network\n(FPN) framework is developed to realize the purpose of automatically searching\nfor a small deep learning surrogate model for HSLO. To address the second\nchallenge, a multimodal neighborhood search based layout optimization algorithm\n(MNSLO) is proposed, which could obtain more and better approximate optimal\ndesign schemes simultaneously in single optimization. Finally, two typical\ntwo-dimensional heat conduction optimization problems are utilized to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. With the similar\naccuracy, NAS finds models with 80% fewer parameters, 64% fewer FLOPs and 36%\nfaster inference time than the original FPN. Besides, with the assistance of\ndeep learning surrogate by automatic search, MNSLO could achieve multiple near\noptimal design schemes simultaneously to provide more design diversities for\ndesigners.",

In response to the above problems, this paper\nproposes a multi-ship cooperative air defense model, which effectively\nintegrates the attack and defense parameters of both sides such as missile\nlaunch rate, missile flight speed, missile launch direction, ship interception\nrate, ship interception range, and the number of ship interception fire units.\nThen, the cooperative interception capability among ships is modeled by the\nmethod of task assignment.

In canonical PIR, a user downloads a message out of $K$ messages from\n$N$ non-colluding and replicated databases in such a way that no database can\nknow which message the user has downloaded (user privacy). In SPIR, the privacy\nis symmetric, in that, not only that the databases cannot know which message\nthe user has downloaded, the user itself cannot learn anything further than the\nparticular message it has downloaded (database privacy). In RSPIR, different\nfrom SPIR, the user does not have an input to the databases, i.e., the user\ndoes not pick a specific message to download, instead is content with any one\nof the messages. In RSPIR, the databases need to send symbols to the user in\nsuch a way that the user is guaranteed to download a message correctly (random\nreliability), the databases do not know which message the user has received\n(user privacy), and the user does not learn anything further than the one\nmessage it has received (database privacy).

It is applicable when hierarchical relationships among\nclasses are available and need to be incorporated along with the multi-label\nclassification whereby each object is assigned to one or more classes. There\nare two key challenges in HMC: i) optimizing the classification accuracy, and\nmeanwhile ii) ensuring the given class hierarchy. To address these challenges,\nin this article, we introduce a new statistic called the multidimensional local\nprecision rate (mLPR) for each object in each class. We show that\nclassification decisions made by simply sorting objects across classes in\ndescending order of their true mLPRs can, in theory, ensure the class hierarchy\nand lead to the maximization of CATCH, an objective function we introduce that\nis related to the area under a hit curve. This approach is the first of its\nkind that handles both challenges in one objective function without additional\nconstraints, thanks to the desirable statistical properties of CATCH and mLPR.\nIn practice, however, true mLPRs are not available. In response, we introduce\nHierRank, a new algorithm that maximizes an empirical version of CATCH using\nestimated mLPRs while respecting the hierarchy. The performance of this\napproach was evaluated on a synthetic data set and two real data sets; ours was\nfound to be superior to several comparison methods on evaluation criteria based\non metrics such as precision, recall, and $F_1$ score.",

These tasks are particularly interesting in\nan unsupervised setting due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining dense image\nannotations, but existing unsupervised approaches struggle with complex scenes\ncontaining multiple objects. Differently from existing methods, which are\npurely based on deep learning, we take inspiration from traditional spectral\nsegmentation methods by reframing image decomposition as a graph partitioning\nproblem. Specifically, we examine the eigenvectors of the Laplacian of a\nfeature affinity matrix from self-supervised networks. We find that these\neigenvectors already decompose an image into meaningful segments, and can be\nreadily used to localize objects in a scene. Furthermore, by clustering the\nfeatures associated with these segments across a dataset, we can obtain\nwell-delineated, nameable regions, i.e. semantic segmentations. Experiments on\ncomplex datasets (Pascal VOC, MS-COCO) demonstrate that our simple spectral\nmethod outperforms the state-of-the-art in unsupervised localization and\nsegmentation by a significant margin.

    "abstract": "High-resolution (HR) MRI is critical in assisting the doctor's diagnosis and\nimage-guided treatment, but is hard to obtain in a clinical setting due to long\nacquisition time. Therefore, the research community investigated deep\nlearning-based super-resolution (SR) technology to reconstruct HR MRI images\nwith shortened acquisition time. However, training such neural networks usually\nrequires paired HR and low-resolution (LR) in-vivo images, which are difficult\nto acquire due to patient movement during and between the image acquisition.\nRigid movements of hard tissues can be corrected with image-registration,\nwhereas the alignment of deformed soft tissues is challenging, making it\nimpractical to train the neural network with such authentic HR and LR image\npairs. Therefore, most of the previous studies proposed SR reconstruction by\nemploying authentic HR images and synthetic LR images downsampled from the HR\nimages, yet the difference in degradation representations between synthetic and\nauthentic LR images suppresses the performance of SR reconstruction from\nauthentic LR images. To mitigate the aforementioned problems, we propose a\nnovel Unsupervised DEgradation Adaptation Network (UDEAN). Our model consists\nof two components: the degradation learning network and the SR reconstruction\nnetwork. The degradation learning network downsamples the HR images by\naddressing the degradation representation of the misaligned or unpaired LR\nimages, and the SR reconstruction network learns the mapping from the\ndownsampled HR images to their original HR images. As a result, the SR\nreconstruction network can generate SR images from the LR images and achieve\ncomparable quality to the HR images.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the cooperative learning of two generative flow models, in\nwhich the two models are iteratively updated based on the jointly synthesized\nexamples. The first flow model is a normalizing flow that transforms an initial\nsimple density to a target density by applying a sequence of invertible\ntransformations. The second flow model is a Langevin flow that runs finite\nsteps of gradient-based MCMC toward an energy-based model. We start from\nproposing a generative framework that trains an energy-based model with a\nnormalizing flow as an amortized sampler to initialize the MCMC chains of the\nenergy-based model. In each learning iteration, we generate synthesized\nexamples by using a normalizing flow initialization followed by a short-run\nLangevin flow revision toward the current energy-based model. Then we treat the\nsynthesized examples as fair samples from the energy-based model and update the\nmodel parameters with the maximum likelihood learning gradient, while the\nnormalizing flow directly learns from the synthesized examples by maximizing\nthe tractable likelihood. Under the short-run non-mixing MCMC scenario, the\nestimation of the energy-based model is shown to follow the perturbation of\nmaximum likelihood, and the short-run Langevin flow and the normalizing flow\nform a two-flow generator that we call CoopFlow. We provide an understating of\nthe CoopFlow algorithm by information geometry and show that it is a valid\ngenerator as it converges to a moment matching estimator. We demonstrate that\nthe trained CoopFlow is capable of synthesizing realistic images,\nreconstructing images, and interpolating between images.",

Furthermore, we employ a condition module to learn\nadaptively step-length and noise level from compressive sampling ratio in every\nstage, which enables the proposed framework to jointly train multi-ratio tasks\nthrough a single model. The proposed model can not only compensate the lost\ncontextual information of reconstructed image which is refined from low\nfrequency error in geometric characteristic k-space, but also integrate the\ntheoretical guarantee of model-based methods and the superior reconstruction\nperformances of deep learning-based methods. All physical-model parameters are\nlearnable, and numerical experiments show that our framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluations.",

The paper is based on our submission to the Oriental Language\nRecognition 2021 Challenge. We participated in two tracks of the challenge:\nconstrained and unconstrained language recognition. For the constrained track,\nwe first trained a Conformer-based encoder-decoder model for multilingual\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR), using the provided training data that had\ntranscripts available. The shared encoder of the multilingual ASR model was\nthen finetuned for the language identification task. For the unconstrained\ntask, we relied on both externally available pretrained models as well as\nexternal data: the multilingual XLSR-53 wav2vec2.0 model was finetuned on the\nVoxLingua107 corpus for the language recognition task, and finally finetuned on\nthe provided target language training data, augmented with CommonVoice data.\nOur primary metric $C_{\\rm avg}$ values on the Test set are 0.0079 for the\nconstrained task and 0.0119 for the unconstrained task which resulted in the\nsecond place in both rankings.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel training method for speaker change\ndetection models. Speaker change detection is often viewed as a binary sequence\nlabelling problem. The main challenges with this approach are the vagueness of\nannotated change points caused by the silences between speaker turns and\nimbalanced data due to the majority of frames not including a speaker change.\nConventional training methods tackle these by artificially increasing the\nproportion of positive labels in the training data. Instead, the proposed\nmethod uses an objective function which encourages the model to predict a\nsingle positive label within a specified collar. This is done by marginalizing\nover all possible subsequences that have exactly one positive label within the\ncollar. Experiments on English and Estonian datasets show large improvements\nover the conventional training method. Additionally, the model outputs have\npeaks concentrated to a single frame, removing the need for post-processing to\nfind the exact predicted change point which is particularly useful for\nstreaming applications.",

Existing works mainly focus on independence-\nand separation-based measures (e.g., demographic parity, equality of\nopportunity, equalized odds), while sufficiency-based measures such as\npredictive parity are much less studied. This paper considers predictive\nparity, which requires equalizing the probability of success given a positive\nprediction among different protected groups. We prove that, if the overall\nperformances of different groups vary only moderately, all fair Bayes-optimal\nclassifiers under predictive parity are group-wise thresholding rules. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, this may not hold if group performance levels vary widely; in\nthis case we find that predictive parity among protected groups may lead to\nwithin-group unfairness. We then propose an algorithm we call FairBayes-DPP,\naiming to ensure predictive parity when our condition is satisfied.\nFairBayes-DPP is an adaptive thresholding algorithm that aims to achieve\npredictive parity, while also seeking to maximize test accuracy.

    "abstract": "Compressive sensing (CS) based computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction\naims at reducing the radiation risk through sparse-view projection data. It is\nusually challenging to achieve satisfying image quality from incomplete\nprojections. Recently, the nonconvex ${{L_ {{1/2}}}} $-norm has achieved\npromising performance in sparse recovery, while the applications on imaging are\nunsatisfactory due to its nonconvexity. In this paper, we develop a ${{L_\n{{1/2}}}} $-regularized nonlocal self-similarity (NSS) denoiser for CT\nreconstruction problem, which integrates low-rank approximation with group\nsparse coding (GSC) framework. Concretely, we first split the CT reconstruction\nproblem into two subproblems, and then improve the CT image quality furtherly\nusing our ${{L_ {{1/2}}}} $-regularized NSS denoiser. Instead of optimizing the\nnonconvex problem under the perspective of GSC, we particularly reconstruct CT\nimage via low-rank minimization based on two simple yet essential schemes,\nwhich build the equivalent relationship between GSC based denoiser and low-rank\nminimization. Furtherly, the weighted singular value thresholding (WSVT)\noperator is utilized to optimize the resulting nonconvex ${{L_ {{1/2}}}} $\nminimization problem. Following this, our proposed denoiser is integrated with\nthe CT reconstruction problem by alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM) framework.

This paper proposes\nGenerSpeech, a text-to-speech model towards high-fidelity zero-shot style\ntransfer of OOD custom voice. GenerSpeech decomposes the speech variation into\nthe style-agnostic and style-specific parts by introducing two components: 1) a\nmulti-level style adaptor to efficiently model a large range of style\nconditions, including global speaker and emotion characteristics, and the local\n(utterance, phoneme, and word-level) fine-grained prosodic representations; and\n2) a generalizable content adaptor with Mix-Style Layer Normalization to\neliminate style information in the linguistic content representation and thus\nimprove model generalization. Our evaluations on zero-shot style transfer\ndemonstrate that GenerSpeech surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of\naudio quality and style similarity. The extension studies to adaptive style\ntransfer further show that GenerSpeech performs robustly in the few-shot data\nsetting. Audio samples are available at \\url{https://GenerSpeech.github.io/}",

It is the first\nreview that summarizes the different GANs methods and the lungs images datasets\nfor COVID-19. It attempts to answer the questions related to applications of\nGANs, popular GAN architectures, frequently used image modalities, and the\navailability of source code. This review included 57 full-text studies that\nreported the use of GANs for different applications in COVID-19 lungs images\ndata. Most of the studies (n=42) used GANs for data augmentation to enhance the\nperformance of AI techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis. Other popular applications\nof GANs were segmentation of lungs and super-resolution of the lungs images.\nThe cycleGAN and the conditional GAN were the most commonly used architectures\nused in nine studies each. 29 studies used chest X-Ray images while 21 studies\nused CT images for the training of GANs. For majority of the studies (n=47),\nthe experiments were done and results were reported using publicly available\ndata. A secondary evaluation of the results by radiologists/clinicians was\nreported by only two studies. Conclusion: Studies have shown that GANs have\ngreat potential to address the data scarcity challenge for lungs images of\nCOVID-19. Data synthesized with GANs have been helpful to improve the training\nof the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models trained for the diagnosis of\nCOVID-19. Besides, GANs have also contributed to enhancing the CNNs performance\nthrough the super-resolution of the images and segmentation.

Two UCI dataset, including the heart disease data and the\nwine quality data, were used to test the power of the independence measures in\nreal conditions.

    "abstract": "A range of optimization cases of two-dimensional Stefan problems, solved\nusing a tracking-type cost-functional, is presented. A level set method is used\nto capture the interface between the liquid and solid phases and an immersed\nboundary (cut cell) method coupled with an implicit time-advancement scheme is\nemployed to solve the heat equation. A conservative implicit-explicit scheme is\nthen used for solving the level set transport equation. The resulting numerical\nframework is validated with respect to existing analytical solutions of the\nforward Stefan problem. An adjoint-based algorithm is then employed to\nefficiently compute the gradient used in the optimisation algorithm (L-BFGS).\nThe algorithm follows a continuous adjoint framework, where adjoint equations\nare formally derived using shape calculus and transport theorems. A wide range\nof control objectives are presented, and the results show that using\nparameterised boundary actuation leads to effective control strategies in order\nto suppress interfacial instabilities or to maintain a desired crystal shape.",

    "abstract": "The Matrix-based Renyi's entropy enables us to directly measure information\nquantities from given data without the costly probability density estimation of\nunderlying distributions, thus has been widely adopted in numerous statistical\nlearning and inference tasks. However, exactly calculating this new information\nquantity requires access to the eigenspectrum of a semi-positive definite (SPD)\nmatrix $A$ which grows linearly with the number of samples $n$, resulting in a\n$O(n^3)$ time complexity that is prohibitive for large-scale applications. To\naddress this issue, this paper takes advantage of stochastic trace\napproximations for matrix-based Renyi's entropy with arbitrary $\\alpha \\in R^+$\norders, lowering the complexity by converting the entropy approximation to a\nmatrix-vector multiplication problem. Specifically, we develop random\napproximations for integer order $\\alpha$ cases and polynomial series\napproximations (Taylor and Chebyshev) for non-integer $\\alpha$ cases, leading\nto a $O(n^2sm)$ overall time complexity, where $s,m \\ll n$ denote the number of\nvector queries and the polynomial order respectively. We theoretically\nestablish statistical guarantees for all approximation algorithms and give\nexplicit order of s and m with respect to the approximation error\n$\\varepsilon$, showing optimal convergence rate for both parameters up to a\nlogarithmic factor. Large-scale simulations and real-world applications\nvalidate the effectiveness of the developed approximations, demonstrating\nremarkable speedup with negligible loss in accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the great success of deep neural networks, learning-based methods\nhave gained promising performances for metal artifact reduction (MAR) in\ncomputed tomography (CT) images. However, most of the existing approaches put\nless emphasis on modelling and embedding the intrinsic prior knowledge\nunderlying this specific MAR task into their network designs. Against this\nissue, we propose an adaptive convolutional dictionary network (ACDNet), which\nleverages both model-based and learning-based methods. Specifically, we explore\nthe prior structures of metal artifacts, e.g., non-local repetitive streaking\npatterns, and encode them as an explicit weighted convolutional dictionary\nmodel. Then, a simple-yet-effective algorithm is carefully designed to solve\nthe model. By unfolding every iterative substep of the proposed algorithm into\na network module, we explicitly embed the prior structure into a deep network,\n\\emph{i.e.,} a clear interpretability for the MAR task. Furthermore, our ACDNet\ncan automatically learn the prior for artifact-free CT images via training data\nand adaptively adjust the representation kernels for each input CT image based\non its content. Hence, our method inherits the clear interpretability of\nmodel-based methods and maintains the powerful representation ability of\nlearning-based methods. Comprehensive experiments executed on synthetic and\nclinical datasets show the superiority of our ACDNet in terms of effectiveness\nand model generalization. {\\color{blue}{{\\textit{Code is available at\n{\\url{https://github.com/hongwang01/ACDNet}}.}}}}",

    "abstract": "Deep learning advanced to one of the most important technologies in almost\nall medical fields. Especially in areas, related to medical imaging it plays a\nbig role. However, in interventional radiotherapy (brachytherapy) deep learning\nis still in an early phase. In this review, first, we investigated and\nscrutinised the role of deep learning in all processes of interventional\nradiotherapy and directly related fields. Additionally we summarised the most\nrecent developments. To reproduce results of deep learning algorithms both\nsource code and training data must be available. Therefore, a second focus of\nthis work was on the analysis of the availability of open source, open data and\nopen models. In our analysis, we were able to show that deep learning plays\nalready a major role in some areas of interventional radiotherapy, but is still\nhardly presented in others. Nevertheless, its impact is increasing with the\nyears, partly self-propelled but also influenced by closely related fields.\nOpen source, data and models are growing in number but are still scarce and\nunevenly distributed among different research groups. The reluctance in\npublishing code, data and models limits reproducibility and restricts\nevaluation to mono-institutional datasets. Summarised, deep learning will\nchange positively the workflow of interventional radiotherapy but there is room\nfor improvement when it comes to reproducible results and standardised\nevaluation methods.",

    "abstract": "We consider fair allocation of a set $M$ of indivisible goods to $n$\nequally-entitled agents, with no monetary transfers. Every agent $i$ has a\nvaluation $v_i$ from some given class of valuation functions. A share $s$ is a\nfunction that maps a pair $(v_i,n)$ to a value, with the interpretation that if\nan allocation of $M$ to $n$ agents fails to give agent $i$ a bundle of value at\nleast equal to $s(v_i,n)$, this serves as evidence that the allocation is not\nfair towards $i$. For such an interpretation to make sense, we would like the\nshare to be feasible, meaning that for any valuations in the class, there is an\nallocation that gives every agent at least her share. The maximin share was a\nnatural candidate for a feasible share for additive valuations. However,\nKurokawa, Procaccia and Wang [2018] show that it is not feasible.\nWe initiate a systematic study of the family of feasible shares. We say that\na share is \\emph{self maximizing} if truth-telling maximizes the implied\nguarantee. We show that every feasible share is dominated by some\nself-maximizing and feasible share. We seek to identify those self-maximizing\nfeasible shares that are polynomial time computable, and offer the highest\nshare values. We show that a SM-dominating feasible share -- one that dominates\nevery self-maximizing (SM) feasible share -- does not exist for additive\nvaluations (and beyond). Consequently, we relax the domination property to that\nof domination up to a multiplicative factor of $\\rho$ (called\n$\\rho$-dominating). For additive valuations we present shares that are\nfeasible, self-maximizing and polynomial-time computable. For $n$ agents we\npresent such a share that is $\\frac{2n}{3n-1}$-dominating. For two agents we\npresent such a share that is $(1 - \\epsilon)$-dominating.

To reach this demanding science goal,\nthe instruments are equipped with eXtreme Adaptive Optics (XAO) systems which\nwill control thousands of actuators at a framerate of kilohertz to several\nkilohertz. Most of the habitable exoplanets are located at small angular\nseparations from their host stars, where the current XAO systems' control laws\nleave strong residuals.Current AO control strategies like static matrix-based\nwavefront reconstruction and integrator control suffer from temporal delay\nerror and are sensitive to mis-registration, i.e., to dynamic variations of the\ncontrol system geometry. We aim to produce control methods that cope with these\nlimitations, provide a significantly improved AO correction and, therefore,\nreduce the residual flux in the coronagraphic point spread function.\nWe extend previous work in Reinforcement Learning for AO. The improved\nmethod, called PO4AO, learns a dynamics model and optimizes a control neural\nnetwork, called a policy. We introduce the method and study it through\nnumerical simulations of XAO with Pyramid wavefront sensing for the 8-m and\n40-m telescope aperture cases. We further implemented PO4AO and carried out\nexperiments in a laboratory environment using MagAO-X at the Steward\nlaboratory. PO4AO provides the desired performance by improving the\ncoronagraphic contrast in numerical simulations by factors 3-5 within the\ncontrol region of DM and Pyramid WFS, in simulation and in the laboratory.

    "abstract": "Many measurements in the physical sciences can be cast as counting\nexperiments, where the number of occurrences of a physical phenomenon informs\nthe prevalence of the phenomenon's source. Often, detection of the physical\nphenomenon (termed signal) is difficult to distinguish from naturally occurring\nphenomena (termed background). In this case, the discrimination of signal\nevents from background can be performed using classifiers, and they may range\nfrom simple, threshold-based classifiers to sophisticated neural networks.\nThese classifiers are often trained and validated to obtain optimal accuracy,\nhowever we show that the optimal accuracy classifier does not generally\ncoincide with a classifier that provides the lowest detection limit, nor the\nlowest quantification uncertainty. We present a derivation of the detection\nlimit and quantification uncertainty in the classifier-based counting\nexperiment case. We also present a novel abstention mechanism to minimize the\ndetection limit or quantification uncertainty \\emph{a posteriori}. We\nillustrate the method on two data sets from the physical sciences,\ndiscriminating Ar-37 and Ar-39 radioactive decay from non-radioactive events in\na gas proportional counter, and discriminating neutrons from photons in an\ninorganic scintillator and report results therefrom.",

So\ncalled Born machines are purely quantum models and promise to generate\nprobability distributions in a quantum way, inaccessible to classical\ncomputers. This paper presents an application of Born machines to Monte Carlo\nsimulations and extends their reach to multivariate and conditional\ndistributions. Models are run on (noisy) simulators and IBM Quantum\nsuperconducting quantum hardware. More specifically, Born machines are used to\ngenerate muonic force carriers (MFC) events resulting from scattering processes\nbetween muons and the detector material in high-energy-physics colliders\nexperiments. MFCs are bosons appearing in beyond the standard model theoretical\nframeworks, which are candidates for dark matter. Empirical evidences suggest\nthat Born machines can reproduce the underlying distribution of datasets coming\nfrom Monte Carlo simulations, and are competitive with classical machine\nlearning-based generative models of similar complexity.",

For Bayes-UCBVI, we prove a regret bound\nof order $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{H^3SAT})$ where $H$ is the length of one episode,\n$S$ is the number of states, $A$ the number of actions, $T$ the number of\nepisodes, that matches the lower-bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{H^3SAT})$ up to\npoly-$\\log$ terms in $H,S,A,T$ for a large enough $T$. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first algorithm that obtains an optimal dependence on\nthe horizon $H$ (and $S$) without the need for an involved Bernstein-like bonus\nor noise. Crucial to our analysis is a new fine-grained anti-concentration\nbound for a weighted Dirichlet sum that can be of independent interest.

    "abstract": "Self-training (ST) is a straightforward and standard approach in\nsemi-supervised learning, successfully applied to many machine learning\nproblems. The performance of ST strongly depends on the supervised learning\nmethod used in the refinement step and the nature of the given data; hence, a\ngeneral performance guarantee from a concise theory may become loose in a\nconcrete setup. However, the theoretical methods that sharply predict how the\nperformance of ST depends on various details for each learning scenario are\nlimited. This study develops a novel theoretical framework for sharply\ncharacterizing the generalization abilities of the models trained by ST using\nthe non-rigorous replica method of statistical physics. We consider the ST of\nthe linear model that minimizes the ridge-regularized cross-entropy loss when\nthe data are generated from a two-component Gaussian mixture. Consequently, we\nshow that the generalization performance of ST in each iteration is sharply\ncharacterized by a small finite number of variables, which satisfy a set of\ndeterministic self-consistent equations. By numerically solving these\nself-consistent equations, we find that ST's generalization performance\napproaches to the supervised learning method with a very simple regularization\nschedule when the label bias is small and a moderately large number of\niterations are used.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models are state-of-the-art in compressive spectral imaging\n(CSI) recovery. These methods use a deep neural network (DNN) as an image\ngenerator to learn non-linear mapping from compressed measurements to the\nspectral image. For instance, the deep spectral prior approach uses a\nconvolutional autoencoder network (CAE) in the optimization algorithm to\nrecover the spectral image by using a non-linear representation. However, the\nCAE training is detached from the recovery problem, which does not guarantee\noptimal representation of the spectral images for the CSI problem. This work\nproposes a joint non-linear representation and recovery network (JR2net),\nlinking the representation and recovery task into a single optimization\nproblem. JR2net consists of an optimization-inspired network following an ADMM\nformulation that learns a non-linear low-dimensional representation and\nsimultaneously performs the spectral image recovery, trained via the end-to-end\napproach. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method with\nimprovements up to 2.57 dB in PSNR and performance around 2000 times faster\nthan state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Edge plasma turbulence is critical to the performance of magnetic confinement\nfusion devices. Towards better understanding edge turbulence in both theory and\nexperiment, a custom-built physics-informed deep learning framework constrained\nby partial differential equations is developed to accurately learn turbulent\nfields consistent with the two-fluid theory from partial observations of\nelectron pressure. This calculation is not otherwise possible using\nconventional equilibrium models. With this technique, the first direct\nquantitative comparisons of turbulent fields between electrostatic two-fluid\ntheory and electromagnetic gyrokinetic modelling are demonstrated with good\noverall agreement found in magnetized helical plasmas at low normalized\npressure.\nTo translate these computational techniques to experimental fusion plasmas, a\nnovel method to translate brightness measurements of HeI line radiation into\nlocal plasma fluctuations is demonstrated via a newly created deep learning\nframework that integrates neutral transport physics and collisional radiative\ntheory for the $3^3 D - 2^3 P$ transition in atomic helium. Using fast camera\ndata on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak, this thesis presents the first 2-dimensional\ntime-dependent experimental measurements of the turbulent electron density,\nelectron temperature, and neutral density in a fusion plasma using a single\nspectral line. With this experimentally inferred data, initial estimates of the\n2-dimensional turbulent electric field consistent with drift-reduced Braginskii\ntheory under the framework of an axisymmetric fusion plasma with purely\ntoroidal field are calculated. The inclusion of atomic helium effects on\nparticle and energy sources are found to strengthen correlations between the\nelectric field and electron pressure while broadening turbulent field\namplitudes which impact ${\\bf E \\times B}$ flows and shearing rates.",

While\nthe applications of QNN have been widely investigated, its theoretical\nfoundation remains less understood. In this paper, we formulate a theoretical\nframework for the expressive ability of data re-uploading quantum neural\nnetworks that consist of interleaved encoding circuit blocks and trainable\ncircuit blocks. First, we prove that single-qubit quantum neural networks can\napproximate any univariate function by mapping the model to a partial Fourier\nseries. Beyond previous works' understanding of existence, we in particular\nestablish the exact correlations between the parameters of the trainable gates\nand the working Fourier coefficients, by exploring connections to quantum\nsignal processing. Second, we discuss the limitations of single-qubit native\nQNNs on approximating multivariate functions by analyzing the frequency\nspectrum and the flexibility of Fourier coefficients. We further demonstrate\nthe expressivity and limitations of single-qubit native QNNs via numerical\nexperiments. As applications, we introduce natural extensions to multi-qubit\nquantum neural networks, which exhibit the capability of classifying real-world\nmulti-dimensional data. We believe these results would improve our\nunderstanding of QNNs and provide a helpful guideline for designing powerful\nQNNs for machine learning tasks.",
