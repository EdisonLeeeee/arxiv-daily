    "title": "Rethinking Fairness: An Interdisciplinary Survey of Critiques of  Hegemonic ML Fairness Approaches",
    "abstract": "This survey article assesses and compares existing critiques of current\nfairness-enhancing technical interventions into machine learning (ML) that draw\nfrom a range of non-computing disciplines, including philosophy, feminist\nstudies, critical race and ethnic studies, legal studies, anthropology, and\nscience and technology studies. It bridges epistemic divides in order to offer\nan interdisciplinary understanding of the possibilities and limits of hegemonic\ncomputational approaches to ML fairness for producing just outcomes for\nsociety's most marginalized. The article is organized according to nine major\nthemes of critique wherein these different fields intersect: 1) how \"fairness\"\nin AI fairness research gets defined; 2) how problems for AI systems to address\nget formulated; 3) the impacts of abstraction on how AI tools function and its\npropensity to lead to technological solutionism; 4) how racial classification\noperates within AI fairness research; 5) the use of AI fairness measures to\navoid regulation and engage in ethics washing; 6) an absence of participatory\ndesign and democratic deliberation in AI fairness considerations; 7) data\ncollection practices that entrench \"bias,\" are non-consensual, and lack\ntransparency; 8) the predatory inclusion of marginalized groups into AI\nsystems; and 9) a lack of engagement with AI's long-term social and ethical\noutcomes. Drawing from these critiques, the article concludes by imagining\nfuture ML fairness research directions that actively disrupt entrenched power\ndynamics and structural injustices in society.",

    "abstract": "The trend to individualized products and shorter product life cycles has\ndriven many companies to rethink their focus on traditional mass production.\nNew technologies and solution concepts like Industry 4.0 foster the advent of\ndecentralization of production control and distribution of information. A\npromising technology for realizing such scenarios are Multi-agent systems\n(MAS). This contribution analyses the requirements for an agent-based\ndecentralized and integrated scheduling approach. Part of the requirements is\nto develop a linearly scaling communication architecture, as the communication\nbetween the agents is a major driver of the scheduling execution time. The\napproach schedules production and auxiliary operations (transportation,\nbuffering and required shared resource operations such as tools) in an\nintegrated manner so that the interdependencies between them are reflected in\nthe solution. Part of the logistics requirements are concerning constraints for\nlarge workpiece handling such as buffer scarcity. However, the approach aims at\nproviding a more general solution that is also applicable to large system sizes\nthat, for example, can be found in production networks where multiple companies\nengage in a joint production effort. In addition, it is applicable for\ndifferent kinds of factory organization (flow shop, job shop and open shop).\nThe approach is explained using an example based on industrial requirements.\nDifferent experiments have been conducted to evaluate the scheduling execution\ntime. The results of the experiments show the approach's linear scaling\nbehavior. Also, an analysis of the concurrent negotiation ability is provided.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering models generally perform better than content-based\nfiltering models and do not require careful feature engineering. However, in\nthe cold-start scenario collaborative information may be scarce or even\nunavailable, whereas the content information may be abundant, but also noisy\nand expensive to acquire. Thus, selection of particular features that improve\ncold-start recommendations becomes an important and non-trivial task. In the\nrecent approach by Nembrini et al., the feature selection is driven by the\ncorrelational compatibility between collaborative and content-based models. The\nproblem is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)\nwhich, due to its NP-hard complexity, is solved using Quantum Annealing on a\nquantum computer provided by D-Wave. Inspired by the reported results, we\ncontend the idea that current quantum annealers are superior for this problem\nand instead focus on classical algorithms. In particular, we tackle QUBO via\nTTOpt, a recently proposed black-box optimizer based on tensor networks and\nmultilinear algebra. We show the computational feasibility of this method for\nlarge problems with thousands of features, and empirically demonstrate that the\nsolutions found are comparable to the ones obtained with D-Wave across all\nexamined datasets.",

A natural\nquestion is then \"how much\" confidence does the case provide? We argue that\nconfidence cannot be reduced to a single attribute or measurement. Instead, we\nsuggest it should be based on attributes that draw on three different\nperspectives: positive, negative, and residual doubts. Positive Perspectives\nconsider the extent to which the evidence and overall argument of the case\ncombine to make a positive statement justifying belief in its claims. We set a\nhigh bar for justification, requiring it to be indefeasible. The primary\npositive measure for this is soundness, which interprets the argument as a\nlogical proof. Confidence in evidence can be expressed probabilistically and we\nuse confirmation measures to ensure that the \"weight\" of evidence crosses some\nthreshold. In addition, probabilities can be aggregated from evidence through\nthe steps of the argument using probability logics to yield what we call\nprobabilistic valuations for the claims. Negative Perspectives record doubts\nand challenges to the case, typically expressed as defeaters, and their\nexploration and resolution. Assurance developers must guard against\nconfirmation bias and should vigorously explore potential defeaters as they\ndevelop the case, and should record them and their resolution to avoid rework\nand to aid reviewers. Residual Doubts: the world is uncertain so not all\npotential defeaters can be resolved. We explore risks and may deem them\nacceptable or unavoidable.

Oftentimes, such methods don't\nexplicitly model the heterogeneity of disease effects, or approach it via\nnonlinear models that are not interpretable. Moreover, unsupervised methods may\nparse heterogeneity that is driven by nuisance confounding factors that affect\nbrain structure or function, rather than heterogeneity relevant to a pathology\nof interest. On the other hand, semi-supervised clustering methods seek to\nderive a dichotomous subtype membership, ignoring the truth that disease\nheterogeneity spatially and temporally extends along a continuum. To address\nthe aforementioned limitations, herein, we propose a novel method, termed\nSurreal-GAN (Semi-SUpeRvised ReprEsentAtion Learning via GAN). Using\ncross-sectional imaging data, Surreal-GAN dissects underlying disease-related\nheterogeneity under the principle of semi-supervised clustering (cluster\nmappings from normal control to patient), proposes a continuously dimensional\nrepresentation, and infers the disease severity of patients at individual level\nalong each dimension. The model first learns a transformation function from\nnormal control (CN) domain to the patient (PT) domain with latent variables\ncontrolling transformation directions. An inverse mapping function together\nwith regularization on function continuity, pattern orthogonality and\nmonotonicity was also imposed to make sure that the transformation function\ncaptures necessarily meaningful imaging patterns with clinical significance.

    "abstract": "In an effort to regulate Machine Learning-driven (ML) systems, current\nauditing processes mostly focus on detecting harmful algorithmic biases. While\nthese strategies have proven to be impactful, some values outlined in documents\ndealing with ethics in ML-driven systems are still underrepresented in auditing\nprocesses. Such unaddressed values mainly deal with contextual factors that\ncannot be easily quantified. In this paper, we develop a value-based assessment\nframework that is not limited to bias auditing and that covers prominent\nethical principles for algorithmic systems. Our framework presents a circular\narrangement of values with two bipolar dimensions that make common motivations\nand potential tensions explicit. In order to operationalize these high-level\nprinciples, values are then broken down into specific criteria and their\nmanifestations. However, some of these value-specific criteria are mutually\nexclusive and require negotiation. As opposed to some other auditing frameworks\nthat merely rely on ML researchers' and practitioners' input, we argue that it\nis necessary to include stakeholders that present diverse standpoints to\nsystematically negotiate and consolidate value and criteria tensions. To that\nend, we map stakeholders with different insight needs, and assign tailored\nmeans for communicating value manifestations to them. We, therefore, contribute\nto current ML auditing practices with an assessment framework that visualizes\ncloseness and tensions between values and we give guidelines on how to\noperationalize them, while opening up the evaluation and deliberation process\nto a wide range of stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Contextual bandits are widely used in industrial personalization systems.\nThese online learning frameworks learn a treatment assignment policy in the\npresence of treatment effects that vary with the observed contextual features\nof the users. While personalization creates a rich user experience that reflect\nindividual interests, there are benefits of a shared experience across a\ncommunity that enable participation in the zeitgeist. Such benefits are\nemergent through network effects and are not captured in regret metrics\ntypically employed in evaluating bandits. To balance these needs, we propose a\nnew online learning algorithm that preserves benefits of personalization while\nincreasing the commonality in treatments across users. Our approach selectively\ninterpolates between a contextual bandit algorithm and a context-free multi-arm\nbandit and leverages the contextual information for a treatment decision only\nif it promises significant gains. Apart from helping users of personalization\nsystems balance their experience between the individualized and shared,\nsimplifying the treatment assignment policy by making it selectively reliant on\nthe context can help improve the rate of learning in some cases. We evaluate\nour approach in a classification setting using public datasets and show the\nbenefits of the hybrid policy.",

    "abstract": "With the recent interest in virtual reality and augmented reality, there is a\nnewfound demand for displays that can provide high resolution with a wide field\nof view (FOV). However, such displays incur significantly higher costs for\nrendering the larger number of pixels. This poses the challenge of rendering\nrealistic real-time images that have a wide FOV and high resolution using\nlimited computing resources. The human visual system does not need every pixel\nto be rendered at a uniformly high quality. Foveated rendering methods provide\nperceptually high-quality images while reducing computational workload and are\nbecoming a crucial component for large-scale rendering. In this paper, we\npresent key motivations, research directions, and challenges for leveraging the\nlimitations of the human visual system as they relate to foveated rendering. We\nprovide a taxonomy to compare and contrast various foveated techniques based on\nkey factors. We also review aliasing artifacts arising due to foveation methods\nand discuss several approaches that attempt to mitigate such effects. Finally,\nwe present several open problems and possible future research directions that\ncan further reduce computational costs while generating perceptually\nhigh-quality renderings.",

    "abstract": "Solving the inverse problem is the key step in evaluating the capacity of a\nphysical model to describe real phenomena. In medical image computing, it\naligns with the classical theme of image-based model personalization.\nTraditionally, a solution to the problem is obtained by performing either\nsampling or variational inference based methods. Both approaches aim to\nidentify a set of free physical model parameters that results in a simulation\nbest matching an empirical observation. When applied to brain tumor modeling,\none of the instances of image-based model personalization in medical image\ncomputing, the overarching drawback of the methods is the time complexity for\nfinding such a set. In a clinical setting with limited time between imaging and\ndiagnosis or even intervention, this time complexity may prove critical. As the\nhistory of quantitative science is the history of compression, we align in this\npaper with the historical tendency and propose a method compressing complex\ntraditional strategies for solving an inverse problem into a simple database\nquery task. We evaluated different ways of performing the database query task\nassessing the trade-off between accuracy and execution time. On the exemplary\ntask of brain tumor growth modeling, we prove that the proposed method achieves\none order speed-up compared to existing approaches for solving the inverse\nproblem. The resulting compute time offers critical means for relying on more\ncomplex and, hence, realistic models, for integrating image preprocessing and\ninverse modeling even deeper, or for implementing the current model into a\nclinical workflow.",

In our work, we (i) compare\nthe rank correlation between five more recent feature attribution methods and\ntwo attention-based methods, on two types of NLP tasks, and (ii) extend this\nanalysis to also include transformer-based models. We find that attention-based\nexplanations do not correlate strongly with any recent feature attribution\nmethods, regardless of the model or task. Furthermore, we find that none of the\ntested explanations correlate strongly with one another for the\ntransformer-based model, leading us to question the underlying assumption that\nwe should measure the validity of attention-based explanations based on how\nwell they correlate with existing feature attribution explanation methods.\nAfter conducting experiments on five datasets using two different models, we\nargue that the community should stop using rank correlation as an evaluation\nmetric for attention-based explanations.

In\nthis problem, a Markov chain $ \\mathsf{X} \\rightarrow \\mathsf{Y} \\rightarrow\n\\mathsf{Z} $ is assumed with fixed marginal distributions\n$\\mathsf{P}_{\\mathsf{X}}$ and $\\mathsf{P}_{\\mathsf{Y}}$, and the mutual\ninformation between $ \\mathsf{X} $ and $ \\mathsf{Z} $ is sought to be maximized\nover the choice of conditional probability of $\\mathsf{Z}$ given $\\mathsf{Y}$\nfrom a given class, under the \\textit{worst choice} of the joint probability of\nthe pair $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$ from a different class. We consider several\nclasses based on extremes of: mutual information; minimal correlation; total\nvariation; and the relative entropy class. We provide values, bounds, and\nvarious characterizations for specific instances of this problem: the binary\nsymmetric case, the scalar Gaussian case, the vector Gaussian case and the\nsymmetric modulo-additive case. Finally, for the general case, we propose a\nBlahut-Arimoto type of alternating iterations algorithm to find a consistent\nsolution to this problem.",

    "abstract": "With constrained resources, what, where, and how to cache at the edge is one\nof the key challenges for edge computing systems. The cached items include not\nonly the application data contents but also the local caching of edge services\nthat handle incoming requests. However, current systems separate the contents\nand services without considering the latency interplay of caching and queueing.\nTherefore, in this paper, we propose a novel class of stochastic models that\nenable the optimization of content caching and service placement decisions\njointly. We first explain how to apply layered queueing networks (LQNs) models\nfor edge service placement and show that combining this with genetic algorithms\nprovides higher accuracy in resource allocation than an established baseline.\nNext, we extend LQNs with caching components to establish a joint modeling\nmethod for content caching and service placement (JCSP) and present analytical\nmethods to analyze the resulting model. Finally, we simulate real-world Azure\ntraces to evaluate the JCSP method and find that JCSP achieves up to 35%\nimprovement in response time and 500MB reduction in memory usage than baseline\nheuristics for edge caching resource allocation.",

Several recent papers\nhave questioned the degree to which the benchmark remains useful to the\ncommunity, yet innovations continue to contribute gains to performance, with\ntoday's largest models achieving 90%+ top-1 accuracy. To help contextualize\nprogress on ImageNet and provide a more meaningful evaluation for today's\nstate-of-the-art models, we manually review and categorize every remaining\nmistake that a few top models make in order to provide insight into the\nlong-tail of errors on one of the most benchmarked datasets in computer vision.\nWe focus on the multi-label subset evaluation of ImageNet, where today's best\nmodels achieve upwards of 97% top-1 accuracy.

On the other hand, we also\nfind that today's best models still make a significant number of mistakes (40%)\nthat are obviously wrong to human reviewers. To calibrate future progress on\nImageNet, we provide an updated multi-label evaluation set, and we curate\nImageNet-Major: a 68-example \"major error\" slice of the obvious mistakes made\nby today's top models -- a slice where models should achieve near perfection,\nbut today are far from doing so.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a surge in interest in building deep learning-based\nfully data-driven models for weather prediction. Such deep learning models if\ntrained on observations can mitigate certain biases in current state-of-the-art\nweather models, some of which stem from inaccurate representation of\nsubgrid-scale processes. However, these data-driven models, being\nover-parameterized, require a lot of training data which may not be available\nfrom reanalysis (observational data) products. Moreover, an accurate,\nnoise-free, initial condition to start forecasting with a data-driven weather\nmodel is not available in realistic scenarios. Finally, deterministic\ndata-driven forecasting models suffer from issues with long-term stability and\nunphysical climate drift, which makes these data-driven models unsuitable for\ncomputing climate statistics. Given these challenges, previous studies have\ntried to pre-train deep learning-based weather forecasting models on a large\namount of imperfect long-term climate model simulations and then re-train them\non available observational data. In this paper, we propose a convolutional\nvariational autoencoder-based stochastic data-driven model that is pre-trained\non an imperfect climate model simulation from a 2-layer quasi-geostrophic flow\nand re-trained, using transfer learning, on a small number of noisy\nobservations from a perfect simulation. This re-trained model then performs\nstochastic forecasting with a noisy initial condition sampled from the perfect\nsimulation. We show that our ensemble-based stochastic data-driven model\noutperforms a baseline deterministic encoder-decoder-based convolutional model\nin terms of short-term skills while remaining stable for long-term climate\nsimulations yielding accurate climatology.",

This\ndata is continuously collected and processed nightly into metadata consisting\nof mileage and time summaries of each discrete trip taken, and a set of\nbehavioral scores describing attributes of the trip (e.g, driver fatigue or\ndriver distraction) so we examine whether it can be used to identify periods of\nincreased risk by successfully classifying trips that occur immediately before\na trip in which there was an incident leading to a claim for that driver.\nIdentification of periods of increased risk for a driver is valuable because it\ncreates an opportunity for intervention and, potentially, avoidance of a claim.\nWe examine metadata for each trip a driver takes and train a classifier to\npredict whether \\textit{the following trip} is one in which a claim occurs for\nthat driver. By achieving a area under the receiver-operator characteristic\nabove 0.6, we show that it is possible to predict claims in advance.\nAdditionally, we compare the predictive power, as measured by the area under\nthe receiver-operator characteristic of XGBoost classifiers trained to predict\nwhether a driver will have a claim using exposure features such as driven\nmiles, and those trained using behavioral features such as a computed speed\nscore.",

    "abstract": "The prior self-supervised learning researches mainly select image-level\ninstance discrimination as pretext task. It achieves a fantastic classification\nperformance that is comparable to supervised learning methods. However, with\ndegraded transfer performance on downstream tasks such as object detection. To\nbridge the performance gap, we propose a novel object-level self-supervised\nlearning method, called Contrastive learning with Downstream background\ninvariance (CoDo). The pretext task is converted to focus on instance location\nmodeling for various backgrounds, especially for downstream datasets. The\nability of background invariance is considered vital for object detection.\nFirstly, a data augmentation strategy is proposed to paste the instances onto\nbackground images, and then jitter the bounding box to involve background\ninformation. Secondly, we implement architecture alignment between our\npretraining network and the mainstream detection pipelines. Thirdly,\nhierarchical and multi views contrastive learning is designed to improve\nperformance of visual representation learning. Experiments on MSCOCO\ndemonstrate that the proposed CoDo with common backbones, ResNet50-FPN, yields\nstrong transfer learning results for object detection.",

    "abstract": "With the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing and cloud\ncomputing, more and more stream analytics applications are being developed\nincluding real-time trend prediction and object detection on top of IoT sensing\ndata. One popular type of stream analytics is the recurrent neural network\n(RNN) deep learning model based time series or sequence data prediction and\nforecasting. Different from traditional analytics that assumes data to be\nprocessed are available ahead of time and will not change, stream analytics\ndeals with data that are being generated continuously and data\ntrend/distribution could change (aka concept drift), which will cause\nprediction/forecasting accuracy to drop over time. One other challenge is to\nfind the best resource provisioning for stream analytics to achieve good\noverall latency. In this paper, we study how to best leverage edge and cloud\nresources to achieve better accuracy and latency for RNN-based stream\nanalytics. We propose a novel edge-cloud integrated framework for hybrid stream\nanalytics that support low latency inference on the edge and high capacity\ntraining on the cloud. We study the flexible deployment of our hybrid learning\nframework, namely edge-centric, cloud-centric and edge-cloud integrated.\nFurther, our hybrid learning framework can dynamically combine inference\nresults from an RNN model pre-trained based on historical data and another RNN\nmodel re-trained periodically based on the most recent data. Using real-world\nand simulated stream datasets, our experiments show the proposed edge-cloud\ndeployment is the best among all three deployment types in terms of latency.\nFor accuracy, the experiments show our dynamic learning approach performs the\nbest among all learning approaches for all three concept drift scenarios.",

Recent goal-based trajectory prediction methods, such as\nDenseTNT and PECNet, have shown good performance on prediction tasks on public\ndatasets.

At the core of our framework is\nkeyframe-based trajectory prediction, where keyframes are representative states\nthat trace out the general direction of the trajectory. KEMP first predicts\nkeyframes conditioned on the road context, and then fills in intermediate\nstates conditioned on the keyframes and the road context. Under our general\nframework, goal-conditioned methods are special cases in which the number of\nkeyframes equal to one. Unlike goal-conditioned methods, our keyframe predictor\nis learned automatically and does not require hand-crafted goal-selection\nalgorithms.

    "abstract": "Enterprises have paid attention to consortium blockchains like Hyperledger\nFabric, which is one of the most promising platforms, for efficient\ndecentralized transactions without depending on any particular organization. A\nconsortium blockchain-based system will be typically built across multiple\norganizations. In such blockchain-based systems, system operations across\nmultiple organizations in a decentralized manner are essential to maintain the\nvalue of introducing consortium blockchains. Decentralized system operations\nhave recently been becoming realistic with the evolution of consortium\nblockchains. For instance, the release of Hyperledger Fabric v2.x, in which\nindividual operational tasks for a blockchain network, such as command\nexecution of configuration change of channels (Fabric's sub-networks) and\nupgrade of chaincodes (Fabric's smart contracts), can be partially executed in\na decentralized manner. However, the operations workflows also include the\npreceding procedure of pre-sharing, coordinating, and pre-agreeing the\noperational information (e.g., configuration parameters) among organizations,\nafter which operation executions can be conducted, and this preceding procedure\nrelies on costly manual tasks. To realize efficient decentralized operations\nworkflows for consortium blockchain-based systems in general, we propose a\ndecentralized inter-organizational operations method that we call Operations\nSmart Contract (OpsSC), which defines an operations workflow as a smart\ncontract. Furthermore, we design and implement OpsSC for blockchain network\noperations with Hyperledger Fabric v2.x. This paper presents OpsSC for\noperating channels and chaincodes, which are essential for managing the\nblockchain networks, through clarifying detailed workflows of those operations.\nThe implementation of OpsSC has been open-sourced and registered as one of\nHyperledger Labs projects.",

    "title": "SoK: Rethinking Sensor Spoofing Attacks against Robotic Vehicles from a  Systematic View",
    "abstract": "Robotic Vehicles (RVs) have gained great popularity over the past few years.\nMeanwhile, they are also demonstrated to be vulnerable to sensor spoofing\nattacks. Although a wealth of research works have presented various attacks,\nsome key questions remain unanswered: are these existing works complete enough\nto cover all the sensor spoofing threats? If not, how many attacks are not\nexplored, and how difficult is it to realize them?\nThis paper answers the above questions by comprehensively systematizing the\nknowledge of sensor spoofing attacks against RVs. Our contributions are\nthreefold. (1) We identify seven common attack paths in an RV system pipeline.\nWe categorize and assess existing spoofing attacks from the perspectives of\nspoofer property, operation, victim characteristic and attack goal. Based on\nthis systematization, we identify 4 interesting insights about spoofing attack\ndesigns. (2) We propose a novel action flow model to systematically describe\nrobotic function executions and sensor spoofing vulnerabilities. With this\nmodel, we successfully discover 104 spoofing attack vectors, 25 of which have\nbeen verified by prior works, while 55 attacks are practical but never\nconsidered. (3) We design two novel attack methodologies to verify the\nfeasibility of newly discovered spoofing attack vectors.",

    "abstract": "Keyword spotting has gained popularity as a natural way to interact with\nconsumer devices in recent years. However, because of its always-on nature and\nthe variety of speech, it necessitates a low-power design as well as user\ncustomization. This paper describes a low-power, energy-efficient keyword\nspotting accelerator with SRAM based in-memory computing (IMC) and on-chip\nlearning for user customization. However, IMC is constrained by macro size,\nlimited precision, and non-ideal effects. To address the issues mentioned\nabove, this paper proposes bias compensation and fine-tuning using an IMC-aware\nmodel design. Furthermore, because learning with low-precision edge devices\nresults in zero error and gradient values due to quantization, this paper\nproposes error scaling and small gradient accumulation to achieve the same\naccuracy as ideal model training. The simulation results show that with user\ncustomization, we can recover the accuracy loss from 51.08\\% to 89.76\\% with\ncompensation and fine-tuning and further improve to 96.71\\% with customization.\nThe chip implementation can successfully run the model with only 14$uJ$ per\ndecision. When compared to the state-of-the-art works, the presented design has\nhigher energy efficiency with additional on-chip model customization\ncapabilities for higher accuracy.",

    "abstract": "We propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) method for collision-free\nnavigation that uses amortized variational inference to approximate the\ndistribution of optimal control sequences by training a normalizing flow\nconditioned on the start, goal and environment. This representation allows us\nto learn a distribution that accounts for both the dynamics of the robot and\ncomplex obstacle geometries. We can then sample from this distribution to\nproduce control sequences which are likely to be both goal-directed and\ncollision-free as part of our proposed FlowMPPI sampling-based MPC method.\nHowever, when deploying this method, the robot may encounter an\nout-of-distribution (OOD) environment, i.e. one which is radically different\nfrom those used in training. In such cases, the learned flow cannot be trusted\nto produce low-cost control sequences. To generalize our method to OOD\nenvironments we also present an approach that performs projection on the\nrepresentation of the environment as part of the MPC process. This projection\nchanges the environment representation to be more in-distribution while also\noptimizing trajectory quality in the true environment. Our simulation results\non a 2D double-integrator and a 3D 12DoF underactuated quadrotor suggest that\nFlowMPPI with projection outperforms state-of-the-art MPC baselines on both\nin-distribution and OOD environments, including OOD environments generated from\nreal-world data.",

This can lead to\nbiases in the risk predictors resulting in poor generalization when applied to\nminority populations and admixed individuals such as African Americans. To\naddress this bias, largely due to the prediction models being confounded by the\nunderlying population structure, we propose a novel deep-learning framework\nthat leverages data from diverse population and disentangles ancestry from the\nphenotype-relevant information in its representation. The ancestry disentangled\nrepresentation can be used to build risk predictors that perform better across\nminority populations.

Insect pollination\nmonitoring and management are therefore essential for improving crop production\nand food security. Computer vision facilitated pollinator monitoring can\nintensify data collection over what is feasible using manual approaches. The\nnew data it generates may provide a detailed understanding of insect\ndistributions and facilitate fine-grained analysis sufficient to predict their\npollination efficacy and underpin precision pollination. Current computer\nvision facilitated insect tracking in complex outdoor environments is\nrestricted in spatial coverage and often constrained to a single insect\nspecies. This limits its relevance to agriculture. Therefore, in this article\nwe introduce a novel system to facilitate markerless data capture for insect\ncounting, insect motion tracking, behaviour analysis and pollination prediction\nacross large agricultural areas. Our system is comprised of Edge Computing\nmulti-point video recording, offline automated multi-species insect counting,\ntracking and behavioural analysis. We implement and test our system on a\ncommercial berry farm to demonstrate its capabilities. Our system successfully\ntracked four insect varieties, at nine monitoring stations within a\npoly-tunnel, obtaining an F-score above 0.8 for each variety. The system\nenabled calculation of key metrics to assess the relative pollination impact of\neach insect variety. With this technological advancement, detailed, ongoing\ndata collection for precision pollination becomes achievable.

People have been using learning tools from\ndiverse fields such as financial mathematics and machine learning in the\nattempt of making trustworthy predictions on such markets. However, the\naccuracy of such techniques had not been adequate until artificial neural\nnetwork (ANN) frameworks were developed. Moreover, making accurate real-time\npredictions of financial time series is highly subjective to the ANN\narchitecture in use and the procedure of training it. Long short-term memory\n(LSTM) is a member of the recurrent neural network family which has been widely\nutilized for time series predictions. Especially, we train two LSTMs with a\nknown length, say $T$ time steps, of previous data and predict only one time\nstep ahead. At each iteration, while one LSTM is employed to find the best\nnumber of epochs, the second LSTM is trained only for the best number of epochs\nto make predictions. We treat the current prediction as in the training set for\nthe next prediction and train the same LSTM. While classic ways of training\nresult in more error when the predictions are made further away in the test\nperiod, our approach is capable of maintaining a superior accuracy as training\nincreases when it proceeds through the testing period.

Between the seller and the buyer,\nthere is an intermediary that can segment the market by releasing information\nabout the true values to the seller. This is termed signaling, and enables the\nseller to price discriminate. In this setting, Bergemann et al. showed the\nexistence of a signaling scheme that simultaneously raises the optimal consumer\nsurplus, guarantees the item always sells, and ensures the seller's revenue\ndoes not increase.\nOur work extends the positive result of Bergemann et al. to settings where\nthe type space is larger, and where optimal auction is randomized, possibly\nover a menu that can be exponentially large. In particular, we consider two\nsettings motivated by budgets: The first is when there is a publicly known\nbudget constraint on the price the seller can charge and the second is the\nFedEx problem where the buyer has a private deadline or service level\n(equivalently, a private budget that is guaranteed to never bind). For both\nsettings, we present a novel signaling scheme and its analysis via a continuous\nconstruction process that recreates the optimal consumer surplus guarantee of\nBergemann et al.\nThe settings we consider are special cases of the more general problem where\nthe buyer has a private budget constraint in addition to a private value.

In this problem, a model trained on an existing KG needs to\nembed an emerging KG with unseen entities and relations. To solve this problem,\nwe introduce the meta-learning setting, where a set of tasks are sampled on the\nexisting KG to mimic the link prediction task on the emerging KG.

In this paper, we give a\nvery simple $O(n\\log n)$ time algorithm for computing a compatible circular\norder for strict circular seriation.

A critical challenge of\ntraining RecSys is its high memory capacity requirements, reaching hundreds of\nGBs to TBs of model size. In RecSys, the so-called embedding layers account for\nthe majority of memory usage so current systems employ a hybrid CPU-GPU design\nto have the large CPU memory store the memory hungry embedding layers.\nUnfortunately, training embeddings involve several memory bandwidth intensive\noperations which is at odds with the slow CPU memory, causing performance\noverheads. Prior work proposed to cache frequently accessed embeddings inside\nGPU memory as means to filter down the embedding layer traffic to CPU memory,\nbut this paper observes several limitations with such cache design. In this\nwork, we present a fundamentally different approach in designing embedding\ncaches for RecSys. Our proposed ScratchPipe architecture utilizes unique\nproperties of RecSys training to develop an embedding cache that not only sees\nthe past but also the \"future\" cache accesses.

Despite its\nstrengths, utilizing these algorithms in a production environment faces several\nchallenges as the number of graph nodes and edges amount to several billions to\nhundreds of billions scale, requiring substantial storage space for training.\nUnfortunately, state-of-the-art ML frameworks employ an in-memory processing\nmodel which significantly hampers the productivity of ML practitioners as it\nmandates the overall working set to fit within DRAM capacity. In this work, we\nfirst conduct a detailed characterization on a state-of-the-art, large-scale\nGNN training algorithm, GraphSAGE. Based on the characterization, we then\nexplore the feasibility of utilizing capacity-optimized NVM SSDs for storing\nmemory-hungry GNN data, which enables large-scale GNN training beyond the\nlimits of main memory size. Given the large performance gap between DRAM and\nSSD, however, blindly utilizing SSDs as a direct substitute for DRAM leads to\nsignificant performance loss.

The goal of this research is to\nuse existing passenger trips for logistics services and thus reduce additional\nvehicle kilometers for freight delivery and the total number of vehicles on the\nroad network. This is achieved by merging the need for two separate fleets into\na single one by combining the services. To evaluate the potential of such a\nmobility-on-demand service, this paper uses an agent-based simulation framework\nand integrates three heuristic parcel assignment strategies into a ride-pooling\nfleet control algorithm. Two integration scenarios (moderate and full) are set\nup. While in both scenarios passengers and parcels share rides in one vehicle,\nin the moderate scenario no stops for parcel pick-up and delivery are allowed\nduring a passenger ride to decrease customer inconvenience. Using real-world\ndemand data for a case study of Munich, Germany, the two integration scenarios\ntogether with the three assignment strategies are compared to the status quo,\nwhich uses two separate vehicle fleets for passenger and logistics transport.\nThe results indicate that the integration of logistics services into a\nride-pooling service is possible and can exploit unused system capacities\nwithout deteriorating passenger transport. Depending on the assignment\nstrategies nearly all parcels can be served until a parcel to passenger demand\nratio of 1:10 while the overall fleet kilometers can be deceased compared to\nthe status quo.",

    "abstract": "Clustering analysis of daily load profiles represents an effective technique\nto classify and aggregate electric users based on their actual consumption\npatterns. Among other purposes, it may be exploited as a preliminary stage for\nload forecasting, which is applied in the same way to consumers in the same\ncluster. Several clustering algorithms have been proposed and developed in the\nliterature, and the choice of the most appropriate set of clustering parameters\nis crucial for ensuring reliable results. In this paper, an automated service,\nsuited for repeated clustering analysis, is presented. The pipeline is able to\nprocess a generic time series dataset and is easily adjustable to test other\nclustering input parameters; therefore, it may be utilized to find the best set\nof parameters with the specific dataset. Moreover, it facilitates repeated\ncharacterization on real-time load profiles with the aim of detecting sudden\nchanges of consumers behaviors and variable external conditions, which\ninfluence the real power forecasting activity on a short temporal scale.",

In this article, we introduce the landscape of Industry 4.0 and\nbeyond empowered by the seamless collaboration of communication technology\n(CT), information technology (IT), and operation technology (OT), i.e., CIOT\ncollaboration. Specifically, CIOT collaboration is regarded as a main\nimprovement of Industry 4.0 compared to the previous industrial revolutions. We\ncommence by reviewing the previous three industrial revolutions and we argue\nthat the key feature of Industry 4.0 is the CIOT collaboration. More\nparticularly, CT domain supports ubiquitous connectivity of the industrial\nelements and further bridges the physical world and the cyber world, which is a\npivotal prerequisite. Then, we present the potential impacts of CIOT\ncollaboration on typical industrial use cases with the objective of creating a\nmore intelligent and human-friendly industry. Furthermore, the technical\nchallenges of paving the way for the CIOT collaboration with an emphasis on the\nCT domain are discussed. Finally, we shed light on a roadmap for Industry 4.0\nand beyond. The salient steps to be taken in the future CIOT collaboration are\nhighlighted, which may be expected to expedite the paradigm shift towards the\nnext industrial revolution.",

To solve this problem, we propose the\nspatio-temporal Transformer (STT) to capture discriminative features within\neach frame and model contextual relationships among frames.

    "abstract": "Short-term traffic flow prediction is a vital branch of the Intelligent\nTraffic System (ITS) and plays an important role in traffic management. Graph\nconvolution network (GCN) is widely used in traffic prediction models to better\ndeal with the graphical structure data of road networks. However, the influence\nweights among different road sections are usually distinct in real life, and\nhard to be manually analyzed. Traditional GCN mechanism, relying on\nmanually-set adjacency matrix, is unable to dynamically learn such spatial\npattern during the training. To deal with this drawback, this paper proposes a\nnovel location graph convolutional network (Location-GCN). Location-GCN solves\nthis problem by adding a new learnable matrix into the GCN mechanism, using the\nabsolute value of this matrix to represent the distinct influence levels among\ndifferent nodes. Then, long short-term memory (LSTM) is employed in the\nproposed traffic prediction model. Moreover, Trigonometric function encoding is\nused in this study to enable the short-term input sequence to convey the\nlong-term periodical information. Ultimately, the proposed model is compared\nwith the baseline models and evaluated on two real word traffic flow datasets.\nThe results show our model is more accurate and robust on both datasets than\nother representative traffic prediction models.",

While\nrecent self-supervised learning methods have achieved good performances with\nevaluation set on the same domain as the training set, they will have an\nundesirable performance decrease when tested on a different domain. Therefore,\nthe self-supervised learning from multiple domains task is proposed to learn\ndomain-invariant features that are not only suitable for evaluation on the same\ndomain as the training set but also can be generalized to unseen domains. In\nthis paper, we propose a Domain-invariant Masked AutoEncoder (DiMAE) for\nself-supervised learning from multi-domains, which designs a new pretext task,\n\\emph{i.e.,} the cross-domain reconstruction task, to learn domain-invariant\nfeatures. The core idea is to augment the input image with style noise from\ndifferent domains and then reconstruct the image from the embedding of the\naugmented image, regularizing the encoder to learn domain-invariant features.\nTo accomplish the idea, DiMAE contains two critical designs, 1)\ncontent-preserved style mix, which adds style information from other domains to\ninput while persevering the content in a parameter-free manner, and 2) multiple\ndomain-specific decoders, which recovers the corresponding domain style of\ninput to the encoded domain-invariant features for reconstruction.

Due to the severity of these\nattacks, manufacturers deploy hardware-based fault defenses into\nsecurity-critical systems, such as secure elements. The development of these\ncountermeasures is a challenging task due to the complex interplay of circuit\ncomponents and because contemporary design automation tools tend to optimize\ninserted structures away, thereby defeating their purpose. Hence, it is\ncritical that such countermeasures are rigorously verified post-synthesis. As\nclassical functional verification techniques fall short of assessing the\neffectiveness of countermeasures, developers have to resort to methods capable\nof injecting faults in a simulation testbench or into a physical chip. However,\ndeveloping test sequences to inject faults in simulation is an error-prone task\nand performing fault attacks on a chip requires specialized equipment and is\nincredibly time-consuming.

Currently,\nlines of research in neuromorphic engineering are trying to develop hardware\nthat mimics the functioning of the brain to acquire these superior\ncapabilities.

This\nregion of the brain acts as a short-term memory with the ability to store\nassociations of information from different sensory streams in the brain and\nrecall them later.

The genome rearrangement problem is\ninterpreted as a problem that transforms one permutation into another in a\nminimum number of moves under certain constraints depending on the chosen\nrearrangements. Finding the minimum number of moves is equivalent to sorting\nthe permutation with the given rearrangement. A transposition is an operation\non a permutation that moves a sublist of a permutation to a different position\nin the same permutation. A \\emph{Prefix Transposition}, as the name suggests,\nis a transposition that moves a sublist which is a prefix of the permutation.\nIn this thesis, we study prefix transpositions on permutations and present a\nbetter upper bound for sorting permutations with prefix transpositions. A\ngreedy algorithm called the \\emph{generalised sequence length algorithm} is\ndefined as an extension of the sequence length algorithm where suitable\nalternate moves are also considered. This algorithm is used to sequentially\nimprove the upper bound to $n-\\log_{3.3} n$ and $n-\\log_3 n$. In the latter\npart of the thesis, we defined the concept of a \\emph{block}. We used it along\nwith the greedy moves of the generalised sequence length algorithm to get an\nupper bound of $n-\\log_2 n$ to sort permutations by prefix transpositions.",

    "abstract": "Modelling robot dynamics accurately is essential for control, motion\noptimisation and safe human-robot collaboration. Given the complexity of modern\nrobotic systems, dynamics modelling remains non-trivial, mostly in the presence\nof compliant actuators, mechanical inaccuracies, friction and sensor noise.\nRecent efforts have focused on utilising data-driven methods such as Gaussian\nprocesses and neural networks to overcome these challenges, as they are capable\nof capturing these dynamics without requiring extensive knowledge beforehand.\nWhile Gaussian processes have shown to be an effective method for learning\nrobotic dynamics with the ability to also represent the uncertainty in the\nlearned model through its variance, they come at a cost of cubic time\ncomplexity rather than linear, as is the case for deep neural networks. In this\nwork, we leverage the use of deep kernel models, which combine the\ncomputational efficiency of deep learning with the non-parametric flexibility\nof kernel methods (Gaussian processes), with the overarching goal of realising\nan accurate probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification. Through\nusing the predicted variance, we adapt the feedback gains as more accurate\nmodels are learned, leading to low-gain control without compromising tracking\naccuracy. Using simulated and real data recorded from a seven degree-of-freedom\nrobotic manipulator, we illustrate how using stochastic variational inference\nwith deep kernel models increases compliance in the computed torque controller,\nand retains tracking accuracy. We empirically show how our model outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods with prediction uncertainty for online inverse\ndynamics model learning, and solidify its adaptation and generalisation\ncapabilities across different setups.",

A\ntypical RL4Rec framework consists of (1) a state encoder to encode the state\nthat stores the users' historical interactions, and (2) an RL method to take\nactions and observe rewards. Prior work compared four state encoders in an\nenvironment where user feedback is simulated based on real-world logged user\ndata.

In response to these shortcomings, we reproduce and\nexpand on the existing comparison of attention-based state encoders (1) in the\npublicly available debiased RL4Rec SOFA simulator with (2) a different RL\nmethod, (3) more state encoders, and (4) a different dataset.

    "abstract": "Robust detection of vulnerable road users is a safety critical requirement\nfor the deployment of autonomous vehicles in heterogeneous traffic. One of the\nmost complex outstanding challenges is that of partial occlusion where a target\nobject is only partially available to the sensor due to obstruction by another\nforeground object. A number of leading pedestrian detection benchmarks provide\nannotation for partial occlusion, however each benchmark varies greatly in\ntheir definition of the occurrence and severity of occlusion. Recent research\ndemonstrates that a high degree of subjectivity is used to classify occlusion\nlevel in these cases and occlusion is typically categorized into 2 to 3 broad\ncategories such as partially and heavily occluded. This can lead to inaccurate\nor inconsistent reporting of pedestrian detection model performance depending\non which benchmark is used. This research introduces a novel, objective\nbenchmark for partially occluded pedestrian detection to facilitate the\nobjective characterization of pedestrian detection models. Characterization is\ncarried out on seven popular pedestrian detection models for a range of\nocclusion levels from 0-99%. Results demonstrate that pedestrian detection\nperformance degrades, and the number of false negative detections increase as\npedestrian occlusion level increases. Of the seven popular pedestrian detection\nroutines characterized, CenterNet has the greatest overall performance,\nfollowed by SSDlite. RetinaNet has the lowest overall detection performance\nacross the range of occlusion levels.",

    "abstract": "PostgreSQL is an object-relational database (ORDBMS) that was introduced into\nthe database community and has been avidly used for a variety of information\nextraction use cases. It is also known to be an advanced SQL-compliant open\nsource Object RDBMS. However, users have not yet resolved to PostgreSQL due to\nthe fact that it is still under the layers and the complexity of its persistent\ntextual environment for an amateur user. Hence, there is a dire need to provide\nan easy environment for users to comprehend the procedure and standards with\nwhich databases are created, tables and the relationships among them,\nmanipulating queries and their flow based on conditions in PostgreSQL. As such,\nthis project identifies the dominant features offered by Postgresql, analyzes\nthe constraints that exist in the database user community in migrating to\nPostgreSQL and based on the scope and constraints identified, develop a system\nthat will serve as a query generation platform as well as a learning tool that\nwill provide an interactive environment to cognitively learn PostgreSQL query\nbuilding. This is achieved using a visual editor incorporating a textual editor\nfor a well-versed user. By providing visually-draggable query components to\nwork with, this research aims to offer a cognitive, visual and tactile\nenvironment where users can interactively learn PostgreSQL query generation.",

The present study borrows philosophical concepts from Gilbert\nSimondon to identify data structures and algorithms that have the biggest\nimpact on running time and memory usage. These are the entity $e$-tuple\n$\\mathcal{E}$ and the intertwined update function $\\phi$. Focusing on\nimplementing data structures in C#, $\\mathcal{E}$ is implemented as a list of\nobjects according to current software engineering practice and as an array of\npointers according to theoretical considerations. Cellular automata simulation\nwith $10^9$ entities over one iteration reveal that object-list with dynamic\ntyping and multi-state readiness has a drastic effect on running time and\nmemory usage, especially dynamic as it has a big impact on the evolution time.\nPointer-arrays are possible to implement in C# and are more running time and\nmemory efficient as compared to the object-list implementation, however, they\nare cumbersome to implement. In conclusion, avoiding dynamic typing in\nobject-list based implementations or using pointer-arrays gives evolution times\nthat are acceptable in practice, even on desktop computers.",

    "abstract": "Tractography has become an indispensable part of brain connectivity studies.\nHowever, it is currently facing problems with reliability. In particular, a\nsubstantial amount of nerve fiber reconstructions (streamlines) in tractograms\nproduced by state-of-the-art tractography methods are anatomically implausible.\nTo address this problem, tractogram filtering methods have been developed to\nremove faulty connections in a postprocessing step. This study takes a closer\nlook at one such method, \\textit{Spherical-deconvolution Informed Filtering of\nTractograms} (SIFT), which uses a global optimization approach to improve the\nagreement between the remaining streamlines after filtering and the underlying\ndiffusion magnetic resonance imaging data. SIFT is not suitable to judge the\nplausibility of individual streamlines since its results depend on the size and\ncomposition of the surrounding tractogram. To tackle this problem, we propose\napplying SIFT to randomly selected tractogram subsets in order to retrieve\nmultiple assessments for each streamline. This approach makes it possible to\nidentify streamlines with very consistent filtering results, which were used as\npseudo ground truths for training classifiers. The trained classifier is able\nto distinguish the obtained groups of plausible and implausible streamlines\nwith accuracy above 80%.

This type of solution evaluation ignores any sub-goal\ninformation that is not explicit in the representation of the planning\ninstances, causing plateaus in the space of candidate generalized plans.\nFurthermore, node expansion in GP is a run-time bottleneck since it requires\nevaluating every child node over the entire batch of classical planning\ninstances in a GP problem. In this paper we define a landmark counting\nheuristic for GP (that considers sub-goal information that is not explicitly\nrepresented in the planning instances), and a novel heuristic search algorithm\nfor GP (that we call PGP) and that progressively processes subsets of the\nplanning instances of a GP problem.

    "abstract": "In the learning literature, the performance of an online policy is commonly\nmeasured in terms of the static regret metric, which compares the cumulative\nloss of an online policy to that of an optimal benchmark in hindsight. In the\ndefinition of static regret, the benchmark policy remains fixed throughout the\ntime horizon. Naturally, the resulting regret bounds become loose in\nnon-stationary settings where fixed benchmarks often suffer from poor\nperformance. In this paper, we investigate a stronger notion of regret\nminimization in the context of an online caching problem. In particular, we\nallow the action of the offline benchmark at any round to be decided by a\nfinite state predictor containing arbitrarily many states. Using ideas from the\nuniversal prediction literature in information theory, we propose an efficient\nonline caching policy with an adaptive sub-linear regret bound. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first data-dependent regret bound known for the\nuniversal caching problem. We establish this result by combining a\nrecently-proposed online caching policy with an incremental parsing algorithm,\ne.g., Lempel-Ziv '78.

    "abstract": "Logic Programs with Ordered Disjunction (LPODs) extend classical logic\nprograms with the capability of expressing preferential disjunctions in the\nheads of program rules. The initial semantics of LPODs, although simple and\nquite intuitive, is not purely model-theoretic. A consequence of this is that\ncertain properties of programs appear non-trivial to formalize in purely\nlogical terms. An example of this state of affairs is the characterization of\nthe notion of strong equivalence for LPODs. Although the results of Faber et\nal. (2008) are accurately developed, they fall short of characterizing strong\nequivalence of LPODs as logical equivalence in some specific logic. This comes\nin sharp contrast with the well-known characterization of strong equivalence\nfor classical logic programs, which, as proved by Lifschitz et al. (2001),\ncoincides with logical equivalence in the logic of here-and-there. In this\npaper we obtain a purely logical characterization of strong equivalence of\nLPODs as logical equivalence in a four-valued logic. Moreover, we provide a new\nproof of the coNP-completeness of strong equivalence for LPODs, which has an\ninterest in its own right since it relies on the special structure of such\nprograms. Our results are based on the recent logical semantics of LPODs\nintroduced by Charalambidis et al.

    "abstract": "Evaluation of deep reinforcement learning (RL) is inherently challenging.\nEspecially the opaqueness of learned policies and the stochastic nature of both\nagents and environments make testing the behavior of deep RL agents difficult.\nWe present a search-based testing framework that enables a wide range of novel\nanalysis capabilities for evaluating the safety and performance of deep RL\nagents. For safety testing, our framework utilizes a search algorithm that\nsearches for a reference trace that solves the RL task. The backtracking states\nof the search, called boundary states, pose safety-critical situations. We\ncreate safety test-suites that evaluate how well the RL agent escapes\nsafety-critical situations near these boundary states. For robust performance\ntesting, we create a diverse set of traces via fuzz testing. These fuzz traces\nare used to bring the agent into a wide variety of potentially unknown states\nfrom which the average performance of the agent is compared to the average\nperformance of the fuzz traces. We apply our search-based testing approach on\nRL for Nintendo's Super Mario Bros.",

    "abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) provide a rich repository to track a\npatient's health status. EHRs seek to fully document the patient's\nphysiological status, and include data that is is high dimensional,\nheterogeneous, and multimodal. The significant differences in the sampling\nfrequency of clinical variables can result in high missing rates and uneven\ntime intervals between adjacent records in the multivariate clinical\ntime-series data extracted from EHRs. Current studies using clinical\ntime-series data for patient characterization view the patient's physiological\nstatus as a discrete process described by sporadically collected values, while\nthe dynamics in patient's physiological status are time-continuous. In\naddition, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) models widely used for patient\nrepresentation learning lack the perception of time intervals and velocity,\nwhich limits the ability of the model to represent the physiological status of\nthe patient.\nIn this paper, we propose an improved gated recurrent unit (GRU), namely\ntime- and velocity-aware GRU (GRU-TV), for patient representation learning of\nclinical multivariate time-series data in a time-continuous manner. In proposed\nGRU-TV, the neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and velocity\nperception mechanism are used to perceive the time interval between records in\nthe time-series data and changing rate of the patient's physiological status,\nrespectively. Experimental results on two real-world clinical EHR\ndatasets(PhysioNet2012, MIMIC-III) show that GRU-TV achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance in computer aided diagnosis (CAD) tasks, and is more advantageous\nin processing sampled data.",

To adapt the EI for better performance under\ncumulative regret, we introduce a novel quantity called the evaluation cost\nwhich is compared against the acquisition function, and with this, develop the\nexpected improvement-cost (EIC) algorithm. In each iteration of EIC, a new\npoint with the largest acquisition function value is sampled, only if that\nvalue exceeds its evaluation cost. If none meets this criteria, the current\nbest point is resampled.This evaluation cost quantifies the potential downside\nof sampling a point, which is important under the cumulative regret metric as\nthe objective function value in every iteration affects the performance\nmeasure. We further establish in theory a near-optimal regret upper bound of\nEIC for the squared-exponential covariance kernel under mild regularity\nconditions, and perform experiments to illustrate the improvement of EIC over\nseveral popular BO algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Remote communication has rapidly become a part of everyday life in both\nprofessional and personal contexts. However, popular video conferencing\napplications present limitations in terms of quality of communication,\nimmersion and social meaning. VR remote communication applications offer a\ngreater sense of co-presence and mutual sensing of emotions between remote\nusers. Previous research on these applications has shown that realistic point\ncloud user reconstructions offer better immersion and communication as compared\nto synthetic user avatars. However, photorealistic point clouds require a large\nvolume of data per frame and are challenging to transmit over bandwidth-limited\nnetworks. Recent research has demonstrated significant improvements to\nperceived quality by optimizing the usage of bandwidth based on the position\nand orientation of the user's viewport with user-adaptive streaming. In this\nwork, we developed a real-time VR communication application with an adaptation\nengine that features tiled user-adaptive streaming based on user behaviour. The\napplication also supports traditional network adaptive streaming. The\ncontribution of this work is to evaluate the impact of tiled user-adaptive\nstreaming on quality of communication, visual quality, system performance and\ntask completion in a functional live VR remote communication system. We perform\na subjective evaluation with 33 users to compare the different streaming\nconditions with a neck exercise training task. As a baseline, we use\nuncompressed streaming requiring ca. 300Mbps and our solution achieves similar\nvisual quality with tiled adaptive streaming at 14Mbps. We also demonstrate\nstatistically significant gains to the quality of interaction and improvements\nto system performance and CPU consumption with tiled adaptive streaming as\ncompared to the more traditional network adaptive streaming.",

    "abstract": "With a wide range of shadows in many collected images, shadow removal has\naroused increasing attention since uncontaminated images are of vital\nimportance for many downstream multimedia tasks. Current methods consider the\nsame convolution operations for both shadow and non-shadow regions while\nignoring the large gap between the color mappings for the shadow region and the\nnon-shadow region, leading to poor quality of reconstructed images and a heavy\ncomputation burden. To solve this problem, this paper introduces a novel\nplug-and-play Shadow-Aware Dynamic Convolution (SADC) module to decouple the\ninterdependence between the shadow region and the non-shadow region. Inspired\nby the fact that the color mapping of the non-shadow region is easier to learn,\nour SADC processes the non-shadow region with a lightweight convolution module\nin a computationally cheap manner and recovers the shadow region with a more\ncomplicated convolution module to ensure the quality of image reconstruction.\nGiven that the non-shadow region often contains more background color\ninformation, we further develop a novel intra-convolution distillation loss to\nstrengthen the information flow from the non-shadow region to the shadow\nregion. Extensive experiments on the ISTD and SRD datasets show our method\nachieves better performance in shadow removal over many state-of-the-arts.

The\nexisting work on source clone detection performs well but in a single\nprogramming language.

Moreover,\nmost existing work rely on manual feature engineering. In this paper, we\npropose a deep neural network model based on source code AST embeddings to\ndetect cross-language clones in an end-to-end fashion of the source code\nwithout the need of the manual process to pinpoint similar features across\ndifferent programming languages. To overcome data shortage and reduce\noverfitting, a Siamese architecture is employed. The design methodology of our\nmodel is twofold -- (a) it accepts AST embeddings as input for two different\nprogramming languages, and (b) it uses a deep neural network to learn abstract\nfeatures from these embeddings to improve the accuracy of cross-language clone\ndetection.

    "abstract": "Current web accessibility guidelines ask visualization designers to support\nscreen readers via basic non-visual alternatives like textual descriptions and\naccess to raw data tables. But charts do more than summarize data or reproduce\ntables; they afford interactive data exploration at varying levels of\ngranularity -- from fine-grained datum-by-datum reading to skimming and\nsurfacing high-level trends. In response to the lack of comparable non-visual\naffordances, we present a set of rich screen reader experiences for accessible\ndata visualization and exploration. Through an iterative co-design process, we\nidentify three key design dimensions for expressive screen reader\naccessibility: structure, or how chart entities should be organized for a\nscreen reader to traverse; navigation, or the structural, spatial, and targeted\noperations a user might perform to step through the structure; and,\ndescription, or the semantic content, composition, and verbosity of the screen\nreader's narration. We operationalize these dimensions to prototype\nscreen-reader-accessible visualizations that cover a diverse range of chart\ntypes and combinations of our design dimensions. We evaluate a subset of these\nprototypes in a mixed-methods study with 13 blind and low vision readers. Our\nfindings demonstrate that these designs help users conceptualize data\nspatially, selectively attend to data of interest at different levels of\ngranularity, and experience control and agency over their data analysis\nprocess.

    "abstract": "We introduce a privacy measure called pointwise maximal leakage, defined\nbased on the pre-existing notion of maximal leakage, which quantifies the\namount of information leaking about a secret $X$ by disclosing a single outcome\nof a (randomized) function calculated on $X$. Pointwise maximal leakage is a\nrobust and operationally meaningful privacy measure that captures the largest\namount of information leaking about $X$ to adversaries seeking to guess\narbitrary (possibly randomized) functions of $X$, or equivalently, aiming to\nmaximize arbitrary gain functions. We study several properties of pointwise\nmaximal leakage, e.g., how it composes over multiple outcomes, how it is\naffected by pre- and post-processing, etc. Furthermore, we propose to view\nprivacy leakage as a random variable which, in turn, allows us to regard\nprivacy guarantees as requirements imposed on different statistical properties\nof the privacy leakage random variable. We define several privacy guarantees\nand study how they behave under pre-processing, post-processing and\ncomposition. Finally, we examine the relationship between pointwise maximal\nleakage and other privacy notions such as local differential privacy, local\ninformation privacy, $f$-information, and so on.",

    "abstract": "The integration between the satellite network and the terrestrial network\nwill play a key role in the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) of mobile cellular\nnetworks thanks to the wide coverage and bandwidth offered by satellite\nnetworks. To leverage this integration, we propose a proactive traffic\noffloading scheme in an integrated multi-satellite terrestrial network (IMSTN)\nthat considers the future networks' heterogeneity and predicts their\nvariability. Our proposed offloading scheme hinges on traffic prediction to\nanswer the stringent requirements of data-rate, latency and reliability imposed\nby heterogeneous and coexisting services and traffic namely enhanced mobile\nbroadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communications (mMTC) and ultra-reliable\nlow latency communication (URLLC). However, the fulfilment of these\nrequirements during offloading in dynamic IMSTN comes at the expense of\nsignificant energy consumption and introduces inherently supplementary latency.\nTherefore, our offloading scheme aims to balance the fundamental trade-offs\nfirst between energy consumption and the achievable data-rate and second\nbetween energy consumption and latency while meeting the respective needs of\nthe present traffic. Our findings prove the importance of the cooperation\nbetween the multi-satellite network and the terrestrial network conditioned by\ntraffic prediction to enhance the performance of IMTSN in terms of latency and\nenergy consumption.",

Our research aims to modify a robot's speech\nto maximize acceptability in various social and acoustic contexts, starting\nwith a use case for service robots in varying restaurants. We created an\noriginal dataset collected over Zoom with participants conversing in scripted\nand unscripted tasks given 7 different ambient sounds and background images.\nVoice conversion methods, in addition to altered Text-to-Speech that matched\nambient specific data, were used for speech synthesis tasks. We conducted a\nsubjective perception study that showed humans prefer synthetic speech that\nmatches ambience and social context, ultimately preferring more human-like\nvoices.

In this paper, we study dynamic HAC on\nedge-weighted graphs. As single-linkage HAC reduces to computing a minimum\nspanning forest (MSF), our first result is to develop a parallel batch-dynamic\nalgorithm for maintaining MSFs. On a batch of $k$ edge insertions or deletions,\nour batch-dynamic MSF algorithm runs in $O(k\\log^6 n)$ expected amortized work\nand $O(\\log^4 n)$ span with high probability. It is the first fully dynamic MSF\nalgorithm handling batches of edge updates with polylogarithmic work per update\nand polylogarithmic span. Using MSF, we obtain a parallel batch-dynamic\nalgorithm that can answer queries about single-linkage graph HAC clusters.\nOur second result is that dynamic graph HAC is significantly harder for other\ncommon linkage functions. Assuming the strong exponential time hypothesis,\ndynamic graph HAC requires $\\Omega(n^{1-o(1)})$ work per update or query on a\ngraph with $n$ vertices for complete linkage, weighted average linkage, and\naverage linkage. For complete linkage and weighted average linkage, this bound\nstill holds even for incremental or decremental algorithms and even if we allow\n$\\operatorname{poly}(n)$-approximation.

    "abstract": "As e-commerce companies begin to consider using delivery drones for customer\nfulfillment, there are growing concerns around citizen privacy. Drones are\nequipped with cameras, and the video feed from these cameras is often required\nas part of routine navigation, be it for semi autonomous or fully-autonomous\ndrones. Footage of ground-based citizens may be captured in this video feed,\nthereby leading to privacy concerns.\nThis paper presents Privadome, a system that implements the vision of a\nvirtual privacy dome centered around the citizen. Privadome is designed to be\nintegrated with city-scale regulatory authorities that oversee delivery drone\noperations and realizes this vision through two components, PD-MPC and PD-ROS.\nPD-MPC allows citizens equipped with a mobile device to identify drones that\nhave captured their footage. It uses secure two-party computation to achieve\nthis goal without compromising the privacy of the citizen's location.\nPD-ROS allows the citizen to communicate with such drones and obtain an audit\ntrail showing how the drone uses their footage and determine if\nprivacy-preserving steps are taken to sanitize the footage. An experimental\nevaluation of Privadome using our prototype implementations of PD-MPC and\nPD-ROS shows that the system scales to near-term city-scale delivery drone\ndeployments (hundreds of drones). We show that with PD-MPC the mobile data\nusage on the citizen's mobile device is comparable to that of routine\nactivities on the device, such as streaming videos. We also show that the\nworkflow of PD-ROS consumes a modest amount of additional CPU resources and\npower on our experimental platform.",

Specifically, we establish a\ncorrespondence between the extracted explicit mesh representation and the\nimplicit neural representation of the target scene.

Our method then utilizes user edits from the mesh representation\nto bend the camera rays by introducing a tetrahedra mesh as a proxy, obtaining\nthe rendering results of the edited scene.

We examined human mobility\nnetworks in Harris County, Texas, in the context of the managed power outage\nforced by Winter Storm Uri to detect communities and to evaluate latent\ncharacteristics in those communities. We examined three characteristics in the\ncommunities formed within human mobility networks: hazard-exposure heterophily,\nsocio-demographic homophily, and social connectedness strength. The analysis\nresults show that population movements were shaped by socio-demographic\nhomophily, heterophilic hazard exposure, and social connectedness strength. The\nresults also indicate that a community encompassing more high-impact areas\nwould motivate population movements to areas with weaker social connectedness.\nHence, the findings reveal important characteristics shaping community\nformation in human mobility networks in hazard response. Specific to managed\npower outages, formed communities are spatially co-located, underscoring a best\nmanagement practice to avoid prolonged power outages among areas within\ncommunities, thus improving hazard-exposure heterophily.

The new UCP datasets now available allow us to perform further\nempirical investigations of the productivity variable in order to estimate the\nUCP effort. Accordingly, four different prediction models based on productivity\nwere used. The results showed that learning productivity from historical data\nis more efficient than using classical approaches that rely on default or\nlimited productivity values. In addition, predicting productivity from\nhistorical environmental factors is not often accurate.

    "abstract": "Image-based volumetric avatars using pixel-aligned features promise\ngeneralization to unseen poses and identities. Prior work leverages global\nspatial encodings and multi-view geometric consistency to reduce spatial\nambiguity. However, global encodings often suffer from overfitting to the\ndistribution of the training data, and it is difficult to learn multi-view\nconsistent reconstruction from sparse views. In this work, we investigate\ncommon issues with existing spatial encodings and propose a simple yet highly\neffective approach to modeling high-fidelity volumetric avatars from sparse\nviews. One of the key ideas is to encode relative spatial 3D information via\nsparse 3D keypoints. This approach is robust to the sparsity of viewpoints and\ncross-dataset domain gap. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for\nhead reconstruction. On human body reconstruction for unseen subjects, we also\nachieve performance comparable to prior work that uses a parametric human body\nmodel and temporal feature aggregation. Our experiments show that a majority of\nerrors in prior work stem from an inappropriate choice of spatial encoding and\nthus we suggest a new direction for high-fidelity image-based avatar modeling.\nhttps://markomih.github.io/KeypointNeRF",

Teaching essential safety measures will lead to a generation that can\nperform basic procedures during an earthquake, which is an important and\neffective solution in preventing the loss of life in this natural disaster. In\nrecent years, virtual reality technology is a tool that has been used to\neducate people on safety matters. This paper evaluates the effect of education\nand premonition on the incorrect decision-making of residents under the\nstressful conditions of an earthquake. For this purpose, a virtual model has\nbeen designed and built from a proposed classroom in a school of the city of\nTehran. Accordingly, two educational scenarios, presented in reality and the\nvirtual model respectively, were conducted on a statistical sample of 20\nstudents within the range of 20 to 25 years of age. Within the mentioned\nsample, the first group of 10 students were taught safety measures in a\ntraditional classroom. The second group of 10 students participated in a\nvirtual classroom. Evaluation tests on safety measures against earthquakes were\ndistributed after two weeks. Furthermore, two self-reporting tests of\nDepression, anxiety, stress test (DASS), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were\nassigned to the second group to evaluate the effect of foresight under two\ndifferent scenarios. The results show that educating through virtual reality\ntechnology yields a higher performance level relative to the traditional\napproach to education. Additionally, the ability to detect earthquakes ahead of\ntime is an influential factor in controlling stress and determining the right\ndecisions should the event occur.",

    "title": "Metamorphic Testing and Debugging of Tax Preparation Software",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a data-driven debugging framework to improve the\ntrustworthiness of US tax preparation software. As the US tax law evolves to\nadapt to ever-changing politico-economic realities, tax preparation software\nplays a significant role in helping taxpayers navigate these complexities.\nGiven the legal implications of bugs in such software on its users, ensuring\nthe compliance and trustworthiness of tax preparation software is of paramount\nimportance. The key obstacles in developing debugging aids for tax preparation\nsystems, however, are the unavailability of explicit specifications and the\ndifficulty of obtaining oracles. We posit that, since the US tax law adheres to\nthe legal doctrine of precedent, the specifications about the outcome of tax\npreparation software for an individual taxpayer must be viewed in comparison\nwith individuals that are deemed similar. Consequently, these specifications\nare naturally available as properties on the software requiring similar inputs\nprovide similar outputs. Inspired by metamorphic testing framework from\nsoftware engineering, we dub these relations metamorphic relations. We\nexplicated metamorphic relations for a set of properties by carefully studying\nthe US Form 1040 as implemented in an open-source tax preparation software. We\ndeveloped a randomized search strategy to explore the space of metamorphic\nrelations and explain the behaviors of software with a classification tree\nalgorithm. Our tool revealed $4$ types of failures in the software and provided\nintuitive explanations to understand the failures.",

    "abstract": "Component-Based Development (CBD) is a popular approach to mitigating the\ncosts of creating software systems. However, it is not clear to what extent the\ncore component selection and adaptation activities of CBD can be implemented to\noperate automatically in an efficient and reliable manner or in what situations\n(if any) CBD is preferable to other approaches to software development. In this\npaper, we use computational complexity analysis to determine and compare the\ncomputational characteristics of fully automatic component-based software\nsystem creation and reconfiguration by de novo design, component selection, and\ncomponent selection with adaptation. Our results show that none of these\napproaches can be implemented to operate both efficiently and reliably in a\nfully automatic manner either in general or relative to a number of\nrestrictions on software systems, system requirements, components, and\ncomponent adaptation. We also give restrictions under which all of these\napproaches can be implemented to operate both efficiently and reliably.

    "abstract": "Building on our recent work on {\\em neuromimetic control theory}, new results\non resilience and neuro-inspired quantization are reported. The term\nneuromimetic refers to the models having features that are characteristic of\nthe neurobiology of biological motor control. As in previous work, the focus is\non what we call {\\em overcomplete} linear systems that are characterized by\nlarger numbers of input and output channels than the dimensions of the state.\nThe specific contributions of the present paper include a proposed {\\em\nresilient} observer whose operation tolerates output channel intermittency and\neven complete dropouts. Tying these ideas together with our previous work on\nresilient stability, a resilient separation principle is established. We also\npropose a {\\em principled quantization} in which control signals are encoded as\nsimple discrete inputs which act collectively through the many channels of\ninput that are the hallmarks of the overcomplete models. Aligned with the\nneuromimetic paradigm, an {\\em emulation} problem is proposed and this in turn\ndefines an optimal quantization problem. Several possible solutions are\ndiscussed including direct combinatorial optimization, a Hebbian-like iterative\nlearning algorithm, and a deep Q-learning (DQN) approach. For the problems\nbeing considered, machine learning approaches to optimization provide valuable\ninsights regarding comparisons between optimal and nearby suboptimal solutions.\nThese are useful in understanding the kinds of resilience to intermittency and\nchannel dropouts that were earlier demonstrated for continuous systems.",

    "abstract": "Recent methods for visual question answering rely on large-scale annotated\ndatasets. Manual annotation of questions and answers for videos, however, is\ntedious, expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we propose to avoid\nmanual annotation and generate a large-scale training dataset for video\nquestion answering making use of automatic cross-modal supervision. We leverage\na question generation transformer trained on text data and use it to generate\nquestion-answer pairs from transcribed video narrations. Given narrated videos,\nwe then automatically generate the HowToVQA69M dataset with 69M\nvideo-question-answer triplets. To handle the open vocabulary of diverse\nanswers in this dataset, we propose a training procedure based on a contrastive\nloss between a video-question multi-modal transformer and an answer\ntransformer. We introduce the zero-shot VideoQA task and the VideoQA feature\nprobe evaluation setting and show excellent results, in particular for rare\nanswers. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive results on MSRVTT-QA,\nActivityNet-QA, MSVD-QA and How2QA datasets. We also show that our VideoQA\ndataset generation approach generalizes to another source of web video and text\ndata. We use our method to generate the \\webdataname{} dataset from the WebVid\ndataset, i.e., videos with alt-text annotations, and show its benefits for\ntraining VideoQA models.

    "abstract": "The last couple of years have seen an emergence of physics-inspired computing\nfor maximum likelihood MIMO detection. These methods involve transforming the\nMIMO detection problem into an Ising minimization problem, which can then be\nsolved on an Ising Machine. Recent works have shown promising projections for\nMIMO wireless detection using Quantum Annealing optimizers and Coherent Ising\nMachines. While these methods perform very well for BPSK and 4-QAM, they\nstruggle to provide good BER for 16-QAM and higher modulations. In this paper,\nwe explore an enhanced CIM model, and propose a novel Ising formulation, which\ntogether are shown to be the first Ising solver that provides significant gains\nin the BER performance of large and massive MIMO systems, like $16\\times16$ and\n$16\\times32$, and sustain its performance gain even at 256-QAM modulation. We\nfurther perform a spectral efficiency analysis and show that, for a\n$16\\times16$ MIMO with Adaptive Modulation and Coding, our method can provide\nsubstantial throughput gains over MMSE, achieving $2\\times$ throughput for SNR\n$\\leq25$ dB, and up to $1.5\\times$ throughput for SNR $\\geq 30$ dB.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen an increasing amount of research devoted to the\ndevelopment of so-called resonance-based methods for dispersive nonlinear\npartial differential equations. In many situations, this new class of methods\nallows for approximations in a much more general setting (e.g. for rough data)\nthan, for instance, classical splitting or exponential integrator methods.\nHowever, they lack one important property: the preservation of geometric\nstructures. This is particularly drastic in the case of the Korteweg--de Vries\n(KdV) equation which is a fundamental model in the broad field of dispersive\nequations that is completely integrable, possessing infinitely many conserved\nquantities, an important property which we wish to capture -- at least up to\nsome degree -- also on the discrete level. A revolutionary step in this\ndirection was set by the theory of geometric numerical integration resulting in\nthe development of a wide range of structure-preserving algorithms for\nHamiltonian systems. However, in general, these methods rely heavily on highly\nregular solutions. State-of-the-art low-regularity integrators, on the other\nhand, poorly preserve the geometric structure of the underlying PDE. This work\nmakes a first step towards bridging the gap between low regularity and\nstructure preservation. We introduce a novel symplectic (in the Hamiltonian\npicture) resonance-based method on the example of the KdV equation that allows\nfor low-regularity approximations to the solution while preserving the\nunderlying geometric structure of the continuous problem on the discrete level.",

    "abstract": "A simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface\n(STAR-RIS) assisted multi-user downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO)\ncommunication system is investigated. In contrast to the existing ideal\nSTAR-RIS model assuming an independent transmission and reflection phase-shift\ncontrol, a practical coupled phase-shift model is considered. Then, a joint\nactive and passive beamforming optimization problem is formulated for\nminimizing the long-term transmission power consumption, subject to the coupled\nphase-shift constraint and the minimum data rate constraint. Despite the\ncoupled nature of the phase-shift model, the formulated problem is solved by\ninvoking a hybrid continuous and discrete phase-shift control policy. Inspired\nby this observation, a pair of hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms,\nnamely the hybrid deep deterministic policy gradient (hybrid DDPG) algorithm\nand the joint DDPG & deep-Q network (DDPG-DQN) based algorithm are proposed.\nThe hybrid DDPG algorithm controls the associated high-dimensional continuous\nand discrete actions by relying on the hybrid action mapping. By contrast, the\njoint DDPG-DQN algorithm constructs two Markov decision processes (MDPs)\nrelying on an inner and an outer environment, thereby amalgamating the two\nagents to accomplish a joint hybrid control. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the STAR-RIS has superiority over other conventional RISs in terms of its\nenergy consumption.

However, due to the dynamic mobility of wireless subnetworks,\nthe data transmission of intra-subnetwork and inter-subnetwork will inevitably\ninterfere with each other, which poses a great challenge to radio resource\nmanagement. Moreover, most of the existing approaches require the instantaneous\nchannel gain between subnetworks, which are usually difficult to be collected.\nTo tackle these issues, in this paper we propose a novel effective intelligent\nradio resource management method using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning\n(MARL), which only needs the sum of received power, named received signal\nstrength indicator (RSSI), on each channel instead of channel gains. However,\nto directly separate individual interference from RSSI is an almost impossible\nthing. To this end, we further propose a novel MARL architecture, named GA-Net,\nwhich integrates a hard attention layer to model the importance distribution of\ninter-subnetwork relationships based on RSSI and exclude the impact of\nunrelated subnetworks, and employs a graph attention network with a multi-head\nattention layer to exact the features and calculate their weights that will\nimpact individual throughput.

    "abstract": "In distributed training of deep neural networks or Federated Learning (FL),\npeople usually run Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or its variants on each\nmachine and communicate with other machines periodically. However, SGD might\nconverge slowly in training some deep neural networks (e.g., RNN, LSTM) because\nof the exploding gradient issue. Gradient clipping is usually employed to\naddress this issue in the single machine setting, but exploring this technique\nin the FL setting is still in its infancy: it remains mysterious whether the\ngradient clipping scheme can take advantage of multiple machines to enjoy\nparallel speedup. The main technical difficulty lies in dealing with nonconvex\nloss function, non-Lipschitz continuous gradient, and skipping communication\nrounds simultaneously. In this paper, we explore a relaxed-smoothness\nassumption of the loss landscape which LSTM was shown to satisfy in previous\nworks and design a communication-efficient gradient clipping algorithm. This\nalgorithm can be run on multiple machines, where each machine employs a\ngradient clipping scheme and communicate with other machines after multiple\nsteps of gradient-based updates. Our algorithm is proved to have\n$O\\left(\\frac{1}{N\\epsilon^4}\\right)$ iteration complexity for finding an\n$\\epsilon$-stationary point, where $N$ is the number of machines. This\nindicates that our algorithm enjoys linear speedup. We prove this result by\nintroducing novel analysis techniques of estimating truncated random variables,\nwhich we believe are of independent interest. Our experiments on several\nbenchmark datasets and various scenarios demonstrate that our algorithm indeed\nexhibits fast convergence speed in practice and thus validates our theory.",

    "title": "Classification and mapping of low-statured 'shrubland' cover types in  post-agricultural landscapes of the US Northeast",
    "abstract": "Context: Novel plant communities reshape landscapes and pose challenges for\nland cover classification and mapping that can constrain research and\nstewardship efforts. In the US Northeast, emergence of low-statured woody\nvegetation, or 'shrublands', instead of secondary forests in post-agricultural\nlandscapes is well-documented by field studies, but poorly understood from a\nlandscape perspective, which limits the ability to systematically study and\nmanage these lands. Objectives: To address gaps in classification/mapping of\nlow-statured cover types where they have been historically rare, we developed\nmodels to predict 'shrubland' distributions at 30m resolution across New York\nState (NYS), using machine learning and model ensembling techniques to\nintegrate remote sensing of structural (airborne LIDAR) and optical (satellite\nimagery) properties of vegetation cover. We first classified a 1m canopy height\nmodel (CHM), derived from a \"patchwork\" of available LIDAR coverages, to define\nshrubland presence/absence. Next, these non-contiguous maps were used to train\na model ensemble based on temporally-segmented imagery to predict 'shrubland'\nprobability for the entire study landscape (NYS). Results: Approximately 2.5%\nof the CHM coverage area was classified as shrubland. Models using Landsat\npredictors trained on the classified CHM were effective at identifying\nshrubland (test set AUC=0.893, real-world AUC=0.904), in discriminating between\nshrub/young forest and other cover classes, and produced qualitatively sensible\nmaps, even when extending beyond the original training data. Conclusions: After\nground-truthing, we expect these shrubland maps and models will have many\nresearch and stewardship applications including wildlife conservation, invasive\nspecies mitigation and natural climate solutions.",

    "abstract": "Recent literature has seen growing interest in using black-box strategies\nlike CheckList for testing the behavior of NLP models. Research on white-box\ntesting has developed a number of methods for evaluating how thoroughly the\ninternal behavior of deep models is tested, but they are not applicable to NLP\nmodels. We propose a set of white-box testing methods that are customized for\ntransformer-based NLP models. These include Mask Neuron Coverage (MNCOVER) that\nmeasures how thoroughly the attention layers in models are exercised during\ntesting. We show that MNCOVER can refine testing suites generated by CheckList\nby substantially reduce them in size, for more than 60\\% on average, while\nretaining failing tests -- thereby concentrating the fault detection power of\nthe test suite. Further we show how MNCOVER can be used to guide CheckList\ninput generation, evaluate alternative NLP testing methods, and drive data\naugmentation to improve accuracy.",

One challenge for largescale simulations of computational\narchitectures based on emerging devices is to accurately capture device\nresponse, hysteresis, noise, and the covariance structure in the temporal\ndomain as well as between the different device parameters. We address this\nchallenge with a high throughput generative model for synaptic arrays that is\nbased on a recently available type of electrical measurement data for resistive\nmemory cells.

    "abstract": "Large transformer-based language models are able to perform few-shot learning\n(also known as in-context learning), without having been explicitly trained for\nit. We hypothesized that specific distributional properties of natural language\nmight drive this emergent phenomenon, as these characteristics might lead to a\nkind of interpolation between few-shot meta-training (designed to elicit rapid\nfew-shot learning) and standard supervised training (designed to elicit gradual\nin-weights learning). We also hypothesized that these distributional properties\ncould lead to emergent few-shot learning in domains outside of language.\nInspired by this idea, we ran a series of experiments on a standard image-based\nfew-shot dataset. We discovered that a number of data properties did indeed\npromote the emergence of few-shot learning in transformer models. All of these\nproperties are present in natural language -- burstiness, long-tailedness, and\nmany-to-one or one-to-many label mappings. The data influenced whether models\nwere biased towards either few-shot learning vs. memorizing information in\ntheir weights; models could generally perform well at only one or the other.\nHowever, we discovered that an additional distributional property could allow\nthe two capabilities to co-exist in the same model -- a skewed, Zipfian\ndistribution over classes -- which occurs in language as well. Notably,\ntraining data that could elicit few-shot learning in transformers were unable\nto elicit few-shot learning in recurrent models. In sum, we find that few-shot\nlearning emerges only from applying the right architecture to the right data\ndistribution; neither component is sufficient on its own.",

    "title": "Metric Learning based Interactive Modulation for Real-World  Super-Resolution",
    "abstract": "Interactive image restoration aims to restore images by adjusting several\ncontrolling coefficients, which determine the restoration strength. Existing\nmethods are restricted in learning the controllable functions under the\nsupervision of known degradation types and levels. They usually suffer from a\nsevere performance drop when the real degradation is different from their\nassumptions. Such a limitation is due to the complexity of real-world\ndegradations, which can not provide explicit supervision to the interactive\nmodulation during training. However, how to realize the interactive modulation\nin real-world super-resolution has not yet been studied. In this work, we\npresent a Metric Learning based Interactive Modulation for Real-World\nSuper-Resolution (MM-RealSR). Specifically, we propose an unsupervised\ndegradation estimation strategy to estimate the degradation level in real-world\nscenarios. Instead of using known degradation levels as explicit supervision to\nthe interactive mechanism, we propose a metric learning strategy to map the\nunquantifiable degradation levels in real-world scenarios to a metric space,\nwhich is trained in an unsupervised manner. Moreover, we introduce an anchor\npoint strategy in the metric learning process to normalize the distribution of\nmetric space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MM-RealSR\nachieves excellent modulation and restoration performance in real-world\nsuper-resolution.

    "abstract": "Despite that convolution neural networks (CNN) have recently demonstrated\nhigh-quality reconstruction for video super-resolution (VSR), efficiently\ntraining competitive VSR models remains a challenging problem. It usually takes\nan order of magnitude more time than training their counterpart image models,\nleading to long research cycles. Existing VSR methods typically train models\nwith fixed spatial and temporal sizes from beginning to end. The fixed sizes\nare usually set to large values for good performance, resulting to slow\ntraining. However, is such a rigid training strategy necessary for VSR? In this\nwork, we show that it is possible to gradually train video models from small to\nlarge spatial/temporal sizes, i.e., in an easy-to-hard manner. In particular,\nthe whole training is divided into several stages and the earlier stage has\nsmaller training spatial shape. Inside each stage, the temporal size also\nvaries from short to long while the spatial size remains unchanged. Training is\naccelerated by such a multigrid training strategy, as most of computation is\nperformed on smaller spatial and shorter temporal shapes. For further\nacceleration with GPU parallelization, we also investigate the large minibatch\ntraining without the loss in accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour method is capable of largely speeding up training (up to $6.2\\times$\nspeedup in wall-clock training time) without performance drop for various VSR\nmodels.

The indices of quantized pixels are\nused as tokens for the inputs and prediction targets of transformer. Although\nan extra CNN network is used to upsample and refine the low-resolution results,\nit is difficult to retrieve the lost information back.To keep input information\nas much as possible, we propose a new transformer based framework \"PUT\".\nSpecifically, to avoid input downsampling while maintaining the computation\nefficiency, we design a patch-based auto-encoder P-VQVAE, where the encoder\nconverts the masked image into non-overlapped patch tokens and the decoder\nrecovers the masked regions from inpainted tokens while keeping the unmasked\nregions unchanged. To eliminate the information loss caused by quantization, an\nUn-Quantized Transformer (UQ-Transformer) is applied, which directly takes the\nfeatures from P-VQVAE encoder as input without quantization and regards the\nquantized tokens only as prediction targets.

While current simulators do not support any parameter estimation due\nto their forward design, we show that the results obtained using estimated\nparameters are very similar to the results of real micrographs. Additionally,\nwe evaluate the denoising capabilities of our approach and show that the\nresults showed an improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Denoised\nmicrographs exhibit less noise in the tilt-series tomography reconstructions,\nultimately reducing the visual dominance of noise in direct volume rendering of\nmicroscopy tomograms.",

We\nuse an interpretable machine-learning framework to provide physical insights\ninto the origin of the spherically-averaged mass profile of dark matter haloes.\nWe train a gradient-boosted-trees algorithm to predict the final mass profiles\nof cluster-sized haloes, and measure the importance of the different inputs\nprovided to the algorithm. We find two primary scales in the initial conditions\n(ICs) that impact the final mass profile: the density at approximately the\nscale of the haloes' Lagrangian patch $R_L$ ($R\\sim 0.7\\, R_L$) and that in the\nlarge-scale environment ($R\\sim 1.7~R_L$). The model also identifies three\nprimary time-scales in the halo assembly history that affect the final profile:\n(i) the formation time of the virialized, collapsed material inside the halo,\n(ii) the dynamical time, which captures the dynamically unrelaxed, infalling\ncomponent of the halo over its first orbit, (iii) a third, most recent\ntime-scale, which captures the impact on the outer profile of recent massive\nmerger events. While the inner profile retains memory of the ICs, this\ninformation alone is insufficient to yield accurate predictions for the outer\nprofile. As we add information about the haloes' mass accretion history, we\nfind a significant improvement in the predicted profiles at all radii.

    "abstract": "Sourav Chatterjee, Persi Diaconis, Allan Sly and Lingfu Zhang, prompted by a\nquestion of Ramis Movassagh, renewed the study of a process proposed in the\nearly 1980s by Jean Bourgain. A state vector $v \\in \\mathbb R^n$, labeled with\nthe vertices of a connected graph, $G$, changes in discrete time steps\nfollowing the simple rule that at each step a random edge $(i,j)$ is picked and\n$v_i$ and $v_j$ are both replaced by their average $(v_i+v_j)/2$. It is easy to\nsee that the value associated with each vertex converges to $1/n$. The question\nwas how quickly will $v$ be $\\epsilon$-close to uniform in the $L^{1}$ norm in\nthe case of the complete graph, $K_{n}$, when $v$ is initialized as a standard\nbasis vector that takes the value 1 on one coordinate, and zeros everywhere\nelse. They have established a sharp cutoff of $\\frac{1}{2\\log 2}n\\log n +\nO(n\\sqrt{\\log n})$. Our main result is to prove, that\n$\\frac{(1-\\epsilon)}{2\\log2}n\\log n-O(n)$ is a general lower bound for all\nconnected graphs on $n$ nodes. We also get sharp magnitude of $t_{\\epsilon,1}$\nfor several important families of graphs, including star, expander, dumbbell,\nand cycle. In order to establish our results we make several observations about\nthe process, such as the worst case initialization is always a standard basis\nvector. Our results add to the body of work of Aldous, Aldous and Lanoue,\nQuattropani and Sau, Cao, Olshevsky and Tsitsiklis, and others. The renewed\ninterest is due to an analogy to a question related to the Google's supremacy\ncircuit.

    "abstract": "Transportation equity advocates recommend improving public transit in\nlow-income neighbourhoods to alleviate socio-spatial inequalities and increase\nquality of life. However, transportation planners often overlook transit\ninvestments in neighbourhoods with \"transit-captive\" populations because they\nare assumed to result in less mode-shifting, congestion relief, and\nenvironmental benefits, compared to investments that aim to attract choice\nriders in wealthier communities. In North American cities, while many\nlow-income households are already transit users, some also own and use private\nvehicles. It suggests that transit improvements in low-income communities could\nindeed result in more transit use and less car use. Accordingly, the main\nobjective of this article is to explore the statistical relationship between\ntransit use and transit accessibility as well as how this varies by household\nincome and vehicle ownership in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA).\nUsing stratified regression models, we find that low-income households with one\nor more cars per adult have the most elastic relationship between transit\naccessibility and transit use; they are more likely to be transit riders if\ntransit improves. However, we confirm that in auto-centric areas with poor\ntransit, the transit use of low-income households drops off sharply as car\nownership increases. On the other hand, a sensitivity analysis suggests more\nopportunities for increasing transit ridership among car-deficit households\nwhen transit is improved. These findings indicate that improving transit in\nlow-income inner suburbs, where most low-income car-owning households are\nliving, would align social with environmental planning goals.",

    "abstract": "With the growing popularity of smartphones, capturing high-quality images is\nof vital importance to smartphones. The cameras of smartphones have small\napertures and small sensor cells, which lead to the noisy images in low light\nenvironment. Denoising based on a burst of multiple frames generally\noutperforms single frame denoising but with the larger compututional cost. In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient yet effective burst denoising system. We\nadopt a three-stage design: noise prior integration, multi-frame alignment and\nmulti-frame denoising. First, we integrate noise prior by pre-processing raw\nsignals into a variance-stabilization space, which allows using a small-scale\nnetwork to achieve competitive performance. Second, we observe that it is\nessential to adopt an explicit alignment for burst denoising, but it is not\nnecessary to integrate a learning-based method to perform multi-frame\nalignment. Instead, we resort to a conventional and efficient alignment method\nand combine it with our multi-frame denoising network. At last, we propose a\ndenoising strategy that processes multiple frames sequentially. Sequential\ndenoising avoids filtering a large number of frames by decomposing multiple\nframes denoising into several efficient sub-network denoising. As for each\nsub-network, we propose an efficient multi-frequency denoising network to\nremove noise of different frequencies. Our three-stage design is efficient and\nshows strong performance on burst denoising. Experiments on synthetic and real\nraw datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nwith less computational cost. Furthermore, the low complexity and high-quality\nperformance make deployment on smartphones possible.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide variety of\nnatural image and medical image computing tasks. However, these achievements\nindispensably rely on accurately annotated training data. If encountering some\nnoisy-labeled images, the network training procedure would suffer from\ndifficulties, leading to a sub-optimal classifier. This problem is even more\nsevere in the medical image analysis field, as the annotation quality of\nmedical images heavily relies on the expertise and experience of annotators. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel collaborative training paradigm with global and\nlocal representation learning for robust medical image classification from\nnoisy-labeled data to combat the lack of high quality annotated medical data.\nSpecifically, we employ the self-ensemble model with a noisy label filter to\nefficiently select the clean and noisy samples. Then, the clean samples are\ntrained by a collaborative training strategy to eliminate the disturbance from\nimperfect labeled samples. Notably, we further design a novel global and local\nrepresentation learning scheme to implicitly regularize the networks to utilize\nnoisy samples in a self-supervised manner. We evaluated our proposed robust\nlearning strategy on four public medical image classification datasets with\nthree types of label noise,ie,random noise, computer-generated label noise, and\ninter-observer variability noise.

    "abstract": "The introduction of ISO 12913-2:2018 has provided a framework for\nstandardized data collection and reporting procedures for soundscape\npractitioners. A strong emphasis was placed on the use of calibrated head and\ntorso simulators (HATS) for binaural audio capture to obtain an accurate\nsubjective impression and acoustic measure of the soundscape under evaluation.\nTo auralise the binaural recordings as recorded or at set levels, the audio\nstimuli and the headphone setup are usually calibrated with a HATS. However,\ncalibrated HATS are too financially prohibitive for most research teams,\ninevitably diminishing the availability of the soundscape standard. With the\nincreasing availability of soundscape binaural recording datasets, and the\nimportance of cross-cultural validation of the soundscape ISO standards, e.g.\\\nvia the Soundscape Attributes Translation Project (SATP), it is imperative to\nassess the suitability of cost-effective headphone calibration methods to\nmaximise availability without severely compromising on accuracy. Hence, this\nstudy objectively examines an open-circuit voltage (OCV) calibration method in\ncomparison to a calibrated HATS on various soundcard and headphone\ncombinations. Preliminary experiments found that calibration with the OCV\nmethod differed significantly from the reference binaural recordings in sound\npressure levels, whereas negligible differences in levels were observed with\nthe HATS calibration.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics invokes endeavors of\ndesigning quantum generative learning models (QGLMs) with computational\nadvantages over classical ones. To date, two prototypical QGLMs are quantum\ncircuit Born machines (QCBMs) and quantum generative adversarial networks\n(QGANs), which approximate the target distribution in explicit and implicit\nways, respectively. Despite the empirical achievements, the fundamental theory\nof these models remains largely obscure. To narrow this knowledge gap, here we\nexplore the learnability of QCBMs and QGANs from the perspective of\ngeneralization when their loss is specified to be the maximum mean discrepancy.\nParticularly, we first analyze the generalization ability of QCBMs and identify\ntheir superiorities when the quantum devices can directly access the target\ndistribution and the quantum kernels are employed. Next, we prove how the\ngeneralization error bound of QGANs depends on the employed Ansatz, the number\nof qudits, and input states. This bound can be further employed to seek\npotential quantum advantages in Hamiltonian learning tasks. Numerical results\nof QGLMs in approximating quantum states, Gaussian distribution, and ground\nstates of parameterized Hamiltonians accord with the theoretical analysis. Our\nwork opens the avenue for quantitatively understanding the power of quantum\ngenerative learning models.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel neural network -- the flow completion network\n(FCN) -- to infer the fluid dynamics, including the flow field and the force\nacting on the body, from the incomplete data based on Graph Convolution\nAttention Network. The FCN is composed of several graph convolution layers and\nspatial attention layers. It is designed to infer the velocity field and the\nvortex force contribution of the flow field when combined with the vortex force\nmap (VFM) method. Compared with other neural networks adopted in fluid\ndynamics, the FCN is capable of dealing with both structured data and\nunstructured data. The performance of the proposed FCN is assessed by the\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) data on the flow field around a circular\ncylinder. The force coefficients predicted by our model are validated against\nthose obtained directly from CFD.

    "abstract": "Decision making algorithms, in practice, are often trained on data that\nexhibits a variety of biases. Decision-makers often aim to take decisions based\non some ground-truth target that is assumed or expected to be unbiased, i.e.,\nequally distributed across socially salient groups. In many practical settings,\nthe ground-truth cannot be directly observed, and instead, we have to rely on a\nbiased proxy measure of the ground-truth, i.e., biased labels, in the data. In\naddition, data is often selectively labeled, i.e., even the biased labels are\nonly observed for a small fraction of the data that received a positive\ndecision. To overcome label and selection biases, recent work proposes to learn\nstochastic, exploring decision policies via i) online training of new policies\nat each time-step and ii) enforcing fairness as a constraint on performance.\nHowever, the existing approach uses only labeled data, disregarding a large\namount of unlabeled data, and thereby suffers from high instability and\nvariance in the learned decision policies at different times. In this paper, we\npropose a novel method based on a variational autoencoder for practical fair\ndecision-making. Our method learns an unbiased data representation leveraging\nboth labeled and unlabeled data and uses the representations to learn a policy\nin an online process. Using synthetic data, we empirically validate that our\nmethod converges to the optimal (fair) policy according to the ground-truth\nwith low variance. In real-world experiments, we further show that our training\napproach not only offers a more stable learning process but also yields\npolicies with higher fairness as well as utility than previous approaches.",

Based\non the gated degradation model, we propose simple baseline networks that can\neffectively handle non-blind, classical, practical degradation cases as well as\nmany other corner cases. To fairly evaluate the performance of our baseline\nnetworks against state-of-the-art methods and understand their limits, we\nintroduce the performance upper bound of an SR network for every degradation\ntype. Our empirical analysis shows that with the unified gated degradation\nmodel, the proposed baselines can achieve much better performance than existing\nmethods in quantitative and qualitative results, which are close to the\nperformance upper bounds.",

    "abstract": "Terahertz ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (THz UM-MIMO) is\nenvisioned as one of the key enablers of 6G wireless systems. Due to the joint\neffect of its large array aperture and small wavelength, the near-field region\nof THz UM-MIMO systems is greatly enlarged. The high-dimensional channel of\nsuch systems thus consists of a stochastic mixture of far and near fields,\nwhich renders channel estimation extremely challenging. Previous works based on\nuni-field assumptions cannot capture the hybrid far- and near-field features,\nand will suffer significant performance loss. This motivates us to consider\nhybrid-field channel estimation. We draw inspirations from fixed point theory\nto develop an efficient deep learning based channel estimator with adaptive\ncomplexity and linear convergence guarantee. Built upon classic orthogonal\napproximate message passing, we transform each iteration into a contractive\nmapping, comprising a closed-form linear estimator and a neural network based\nnon-linear estimator. A major algorithmic innovation involves applying fixed\npoint iteration to compute the channel estimate while modeling neural networks\nwith arbitrary depth and adapting to the hybrid-field channel conditions.\nSimulation results will verify our theoretical analysis and show significant\nperformance gains over state-of-the-art approaches in the estimation accuracy\nand convergence rate.",

Depending on the\nsize of the neighborhood, the resulting Gromov centrality defines the\nimportance of a node at different scales in the graph, and recovers as limits\nwell-known concept such as the clustering coefficient and closeness centrality.\nWe argue that Gromov centrality is affected by the geometric and boundary\nconstraints of the network, and illustrate how it can help distinguish\ndifferent types of nodes in random geometric graphs and empirical\ntransportation networks.",

    "abstract": "Disentangling anatomical and contrast information from medical images has\ngained attention recently, demonstrating benefits for various image analysis\ntasks. Current methods learn disentangled representations using either paired\nmulti-modal images with the same underlying anatomy or auxiliary labels (e.g.,\nmanual delineations) to provide inductive bias for disentanglement. However,\nthese requirements could significantly increase the time and cost in data\ncollection and limit the applicability of these methods when such data are not\navailable. Moreover, these methods generally do not guarantee disentanglement.\nIn this paper, we present a novel framework that learns theoretically and\npractically superior disentanglement from single modality magnetic resonance\nimages. Moreover, we propose a new information-based metric to quantitatively\nevaluate disentanglement. Comparisons over existing disentangling methods\ndemonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both\ndisentanglement and cross-domain image-to-image translation tasks.",

    "abstract": "Quantum annealing (QA) that encodes optimization problems into Hamiltonians\nremains the only near-term quantum computing paradigm that provides sufficient\nmany qubits for real-world applications. To fit larger optimization instances\non existing quantum annealers, reducing Hamiltonians into smaller equivalent\nHamiltonians provides a promising approach. Unfortunately, existing reduction\ntechniques are either computationally expensive or ineffective in practice. To\nthis end, we introduce a novel notion of non-separable~group, defined as a\nsubset of qubits in a Hamiltonian that obtains the same value in optimal\nsolutions. We develop a theoretical framework on non-separability accordingly\nand propose FastHare, a highly efficient reduction method. FastHare,\niteratively, detects and merges non-separable groups into single qubits. It\ndoes so within a provable worst-case time complexity of only $O(\\alpha n^2)$,\nfor some user-defined parameter $\\alpha$. Our extensive benchmarks for the\nfeasibility of the reduction are done on both synthetic Hamiltonians and 3000+\ninstances from the MQLIB library. The results show FastHare outperforms the\nroof duality, the implemented reduction method in D-Wave's SDK library, with\n3.6x higher average reduction ratio. It demonstrates a high level of\neffectiveness with an average of 62% qubits saving and 0.3s processing time,\nadvocating for Hamiltonian reduction as an inexpensive necessity for QA.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on day-to-day life.\nTackling the disease by providing the necessary resources to the affected is of\nparamount importance. However, estimation of the required resources is not a\ntrivial task given the number of factors which determine the requirement. This\nissue can be addressed by predicting the probability that an infected patient\nrequires Intensive Care Unit (ICU) support and the importance of each of the\nfactors that influence it. Moreover, to assist the doctors in determining the\npatients at high risk of fatality, the probability of death is also calculated.\nFor determining both the patient outcomes (ICU admission and death), a novel\nmethodology is proposed by combining multi-modal features, extracted from\nComputed Tomography (CT) scans and Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. Deep\nlearning models are leveraged to extract quantitative features from CT scans.\nThese features combined with those directly read from the EHR database are fed\ninto machine learning models to eventually output the probabilities of patient\noutcomes. This work demonstrates both the ability to apply a broad set of deep\nlearning methods for general quantification of Chest CT scans and the ability\nto link these quantitative metrics to patient outcomes. The effectiveness of\nthe proposed method is shown by testing it on an internally curated dataset,\nachieving a mean area under Receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of\n0.77 on ICU admission prediction and a mean AUC of 0.73 on death prediction\nusing the best performing classifiers.",

    "abstract": "Due to the wide-ranging travel restrictions and lockdowns applied to limit\nthe diffusion of the SARS-CoV2 virus, the coronavirus disease of 2019\n(COVID-19) pandemic has had an immediate and significant effect on human\nmobility at the global, national, and local levels. At the local level,\nbike-sharing played a significant role in urban transport during the pandemic\nsince riders could travel outdoors with reduced infection risk. However, based\non different data resources, this non-motorized mode of transportation was\nstill negatively affected by the pandemic (i.e., relative reduction in\nridership). This study has two objectives: 1) to investigate the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on the numbers and duration of trips conducted through a\nbike-sharing system -- the Capital Bikeshare in Washington, DC, USA; and 2) to\nexplore whether land use and household income in the nation's capital influence\nthe spatial variation of ridership during the pandemic. Towards realizing these\nobjectives, this research looks at the relationship between bike sharing and\nCOVID-19 transmission as a two-directional relationship rather than a\none-directional causal relationship. Accordingly, this study models i) the\nimpact of COVID-19 infection numbers and rates on the use of the Capital\nBikeshare system and ii) the risk of COVID-19 transmission among individual\nbike-sharing users. In other words, we examine i) the cyclist's behavior as a\nfunction of the COVID-19 transmission evolution in an urban environment and ii)\nthe possible relationship between the bike share usage and the COVID-19\ntransmission through adopting a probabilistic contagion model. The findings\nshow the risk of using a bike-sharing system during the pandemic and whether\nbike sharing remains a healthier alternative mode of transportation in terms of\ninfection risk.",

    "title": "On learning agent-based models from data",
    "abstract": "Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are used in several fields to study the evolution\nof complex systems from micro-level assumptions. However, ABMs typically can\nnot estimate agent-specific (or \"micro\") variables: this is a major limitation\nwhich prevents ABMs from harnessing micro-level data availability and which\ngreatly limits their predictive power. In this paper, we propose a protocol to\nlearn the latent micro-variables of an ABM from data. The first step of our\nprotocol is to reduce an ABM to a probabilistic model, characterized by a\ncomputationally tractable likelihood. This reduction follows two general design\nprinciples: balance of stochasticity and data availability, and replacement of\nunobservable discrete choices with differentiable approximations. Then, our\nprotocol proceeds by maximizing the likelihood of the latent variables via a\ngradient-based expectation maximization algorithm. We demonstrate our protocol\nby applying it to an ABM of the housing market, in which agents with different\nincomes bid higher prices to live in high-income neighborhoods. We demonstrate\nthat the obtained model allows accurate estimates of the latent variables,\nwhile preserving the general behavior of the ABM. We also show that our\nestimates can be used for out-of-sample forecasting. Our protocol can be seen\nas an alternative to black-box data assimilation methods, that forces the\nmodeler to lay bare the assumptions of the model, to think about the\ninferential process, and to spot potential identification problems.",

    "abstract": "Exploring quantum applications of near-term quantum devices is a rapidly\ngrowing field of quantum information science with both theoretical and\npractical interests. A leading paradigm to establish such near-term quantum\napplications is variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). These algorithms use a\nclassical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit to accomplish\ncertain tasks, where the circuits are usually randomly initialized. In this\nwork, we prove that for a broad class of such random circuits, the variation\nrange of the cost function via adjusting any local quantum gate within the\ncircuit vanishes exponentially in the number of qubits with a high probability.\nThis result can unify the restrictions on gradient-based and gradient-free\noptimizations in a natural manner and reveal extra harsh constraints on the\ntraining landscapes of VQAs. Hence a fundamental limitation on the trainability\nof VQAs is unraveled, indicating the essence of the optimization hardness in\nthe Hilbert space with exponential dimension. We further showcase the validity\nof our results with numerical simulations of representative VQAs. We believe\nthat these results would deepen our understanding of the scalability of VQAs\nand shed light on the search for near-term quantum applications with\nadvantages.",
