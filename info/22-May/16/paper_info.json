    "abstract": "Analog mixed-signal (AMS) devices promise faster, more energy-efficient deep\nneural network (DNN) inference than their digital counterparts. However, recent\nstudies show that DNNs on AMS devices with fixed-point numbers can incur an\naccuracy penalty because of precision loss. To mitigate this penalty, we\npresent a novel AMS-compatible adaptive block floating-point (ABFP) number\nrepresentation. We also introduce amplification (or gain) as a method for\nincreasing the accuracy of the number representation without increasing the bit\nprecision of the output. We evaluate the effectiveness of ABFP on the DNNs in\nthe MLPerf datacenter inference benchmark -- realizing less than $1\\%$ loss in\naccuracy compared to FLOAT32. We also propose a novel method of finetuning for\nAMS devices, Differential Noise Finetuning (DNF), which samples device noise to\nspeed up finetuning compared to conventional Quantization-Aware Training.",

Existing inversion approaches\nobtain promising yet imperfect results, having to trade-off between\nreconstruction quality and downstream editability. To improve quality, these\napproaches must resort to various techniques that extend the model latent space\nafter training. Taking a step back, we observe that these methods essentially\nall propose, in one way or another, to increase the number of free parameters.\nThis suggests that inversion might be difficult because it is underconstrained.\nIn this work, we address this directly and dramatically overparameterize the\nlatent space, before training, with simple changes to the original StyleGAN\narchitecture. Our overparameterization increases the available degrees of\nfreedom, which in turn facilitates inversion. We show that this allows us to\nobtain near-perfect image reconstruction without the need for encoders nor for\naltering the latent space after training.

    "abstract": "Augmented reality applications have rapidly spread across online platforms,\nallowing consumers to virtually try-on a variety of products, such as makeup,\nhair dying, or shoes. However, parametrizing a renderer to synthesize realistic\nimages of a given product remains a challenging task that requires expert\nknowledge. While recent work has introduced neural rendering methods for\nvirtual try-on from example images, current approaches are based on large\ngenerative models that cannot be used in real-time on mobile devices. This\ncalls for a hybrid method that combines the advantages of computer graphics and\nneural rendering approaches. In this paper we propose a novel framework based\non deep learning to build a real-time inverse graphics encoder that learns to\nmap a single example image into the parameter space of a given augmented\nreality rendering engine. Our method leverages self-supervised learning and\ndoes not require labeled training data which makes it extendable to many\nvirtual try-on applications. Furthermore, most augmented reality renderers are\nnot differentiable in practice due to algorithmic choices or implementation\nconstraints to reach real-time on portable devices. To relax the need for a\ngraphics-based differentiable renderer in inverse graphics problems, we\nintroduce a trainable imitator module. Our imitator is a generative network\nthat learns to accurately reproduce the behavior of a given non-differentiable\nrenderer. We propose a novel rendering sensitivity loss to train the imitator,\nwhich ensures that the network learns an accurate and continuous representation\nfor each rendering parameter. Our framework enables novel applications where\nconsumers can virtually try-on a novel unknown product from an inspirational\nreference image on social media. It can also be used by graphics artists to\nautomatically create realistic rendering from a reference product image.",

However, online epistemic environments are\nincreasingly polluted, impairing societies' ability to coordinate effectively\nin the face of global crises. We argue that centralized platforms are a main\nsource of epistemic pollution, and that healthier environments require\nredesigning how we collectively govern attention.

NAS has outperformed hand-designed\nnetworks and made a significant step forward in the field of automating the\ndesign of deep neural networks, thus further reducing the need for human\nexpertise. However, most research is done targeting a single specific task,\nleaving research of NAS methods over multiple tasks mostly overlooked.\nGenerally, there exist two popular ways to find an architecture for some novel\ntask.

In this work, we present a\nmeta-learning framework to warm-start Differentiable architecture search\n(DARTS). DARTS is a NAS method that can be initialized with a transferred\narchitecture and is able to quickly adapt to new tasks. A task similarity\nmeasure is used to determine which transfer architecture is selected, as\ntransfer architectures found on similar tasks will likely perform better.\nAdditionally, we employ a simple meta-transfer architecture that was learned\nover multiple tasks.

    "abstract": "In-storage computing with modern solid-state drives (SSDs) enables developers\nto offload programs from the host to the SSD. It has been proven to be an\neffective approach to alleviating the I/O bottleneck. To facilitate in-storage\ncomputing, many frameworks have been proposed. However, few of them consider\nsecurity as the priority for in-storage computing. Specifically, since modern\nSSD controllers do not have a trusted execution environment, an offloaded\n(malicious) program could steal, modify, and even destroy the data stored in\nthe SSD. In this paper, we first investigate the attacks that could be\nconducted by offloaded in-storage programs. To defend against these attacks, we\nbuild IceClave, a lightweight trusted execution environment for in-storage\ncomputing. IceClave enables security isolation between in-storage programs and\nflash management functions. IceClave also achieves security isolation between\nin-storage programs and enforces memory encryption and integrity verification\nof in-storage DRAM with low overhead. To protect data loaded from flash chips,\nIceClave develops a lightweight data encryption/decryption mechanism in flash\ncontrollers. We develop IceClave with a full system simulator and evaluate\nIceClave with a variety of data-intensive applications. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art in-storage computing approaches, IceClave introduces only 7.6%\nperformance overhead, while enforcing security isolation in the SSD controller\nwith minimal hardware cost. IceClave still keeps the performance benefit of\nin-storage computing by delivering up to 2.31$\\times$ better performance than\nthe conventional host-based trusted computing approach.",

    "abstract": "A large body of research has shown that machine learning models are\nvulnerable to membership inference (MI) attacks that violate the privacy of the\nparticipants in the training data. Most MI research focuses on the case of a\nsingle standalone model, while production machine-learning platforms often\nupdate models over time, on data that often shifts in distribution, giving the\nattacker more information. This paper proposes new attacks that take advantage\nof one or more model updates to improve MI. A key part of our approach is to\nleverage rich information from standalone MI attacks mounted separately against\nthe original and updated models, and to combine this information in specific\nways to improve attack effectiveness. We propose a set of combination functions\nand tuning methods for each, and present both analytical and quantitative\njustification for various options. Our results on four public datasets show\nthat our attacks are effective at using update information to give the\nadversary a significant advantage over attacks on standalone models, but also\ncompared to a prior MI attack that takes advantage of model updates in a\nrelated machine-unlearning setting. We perform the first measurements of the\nimpact of distribution shift on MI attacks with model updates, and show that a\nmore drastic distribution shift results in significantly higher MI risk than a\ngradual shift.

    "abstract": "The Spotted Lanternfly (SLF) is an invasive planthopper that threatens the\nlocal biodiversity and agricultural economy of regions such as the Northeastern\nUnited States and Japan. As researchers scramble to study the insect, there is\na great potential for computer vision tasks such as detection, pose estimation,\nand accurate identification to have important downstream implications in\ncontaining the SLF. However, there is currently no publicly available dataset\nfor training such AI models. To enable computer vision applications and\nmotivate advancements to challenge the invasive SLF problem, we propose\nLANTERN-RD, the first curated image dataset of the spotted lanternfly and its\nlook-alikes, featuring images with varied lighting conditions, diverse\nbackgrounds, and subjects in assorted poses. A VGG16-based baseline CNN\nvalidates the potential of this dataset for stimulating fresh computer vision\napplications to accelerate invasive SLF research. Additionally, we implement\nthe trained model in a simple mobile classification application in order to\ndirectly empower responsible public mitigation efforts. The overarching mission\nof this work is to introduce a novel SLF image dataset and release a\nclassification framework that enables computer vision applications, boosting\nstudies surrounding the invasive SLF and assisting in minimizing its\nagricultural and economic damage.",

In this work, we propose\nPoisonedEncoder, a data poisoning attack to contrastive learning. In\nparticular, an attacker injects carefully crafted poisoning inputs into the\nunlabeled pre-training data, such that the downstream classifiers built based\non the poisoned encoder for multiple target downstream tasks simultaneously\nclassify attacker-chosen, arbitrary clean inputs as attacker-chosen, arbitrary\nclasses. We formulate our data poisoning attack as a bilevel optimization\nproblem, whose solution is the set of poisoning inputs; and we propose a\ncontrastive-learning-tailored method to approximately solve it. Our evaluation\non multiple datasets shows that PoisonedEncoder achieves high attack success\nrates while maintaining the testing accuracy of the downstream classifiers\nbuilt upon the poisoned encoder for non-attacker-chosen inputs. We also\nevaluate five defenses against PoisonedEncoder, including one pre-processing,\nthree in-processing, and one post-processing defenses.

The recent advancement and even revolution of the HS RS technique\noffer opportunities to realize the full potential of various applications,\nwhile confronting new challenges for efficiently processing and analyzing the\nenormous HS acquisition data. Due to the maintenance of the 3-D HS inherent\nstructure, tensor decomposition has aroused widespread concern and research in\nHS data processing tasks over the past decades. In this article, we aim at\npresenting a comprehensive overview of tensor decomposition, specifically\ncontextualizing the five broad topics in HS data processing, and they are HS\nrestoration, compressed sensing, anomaly detection, super-resolution, and\nspectral unmixing. For each topic, we elaborate on the remarkable achievements\nof tensor decomposition models for HS RS with a pivotal description of the\nexisting methodologies and a representative exhibition on the experimental\nresults. As a result, the remaining challenges of the follow-up research\ndirections are outlined and discussed from the perspective of the real HS RS\npractices and tensor decomposition merged with advanced priors and even with\ndeep neural networks. This article summarizes different tensor\ndecomposition-based HS data processing methods and categorizes them into\ndifferent classes from simple adoptions to complex combinations with other\npriors for the algorithm beginners.

    "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) is the field that attempts to make human\nlanguage accessible to computers, and it relies on applying a mathematical\nmodel to express the meaning of symbolic language. One such model, DisCoCat,\ndefines how to express both the meaning of individual words as well as their\ncompositional nature. This model can be naturally implemented on quantum\ncomputers, leading to the field quantum NLP (QNLP). Recent experimental work\nused quantum machine learning techniques to map from text to class label using\nthe expectation value of the quantum encoded sentence. Theoretical work has\nbeen done on computing the similarity of sentences but relies on an unrealized\nquantum memory store. The main goal of this thesis is to leverage the DisCoCat\nmodel to design a quantum-based kernel function that can be used by a support\nvector machine (SVM) for NLP tasks. Two similarity measures were studied: (i)\nthe transition amplitude approach and (ii) the SWAP test. A simple NLP meaning\nclassification task from previous work was used to train the word embeddings\nand evaluate the performance of both models. The Python module lambeq and its\nrelated software stack was used for implementation. The explicit model from\nprevious work was used to train word embeddings and achieved a testing accuracy\nof $93.09 \\pm 0.01$%. It was shown that both the SVM variants achieved a higher\ntesting accuracy of $95.72 \\pm 0.01$% for approach (i) and $97.14 \\pm 0.01$%\nfor (ii). The SWAP test was then simulated under a noise model defined by the\nreal quantum device, ibmq_guadalupe. The explicit model achieved an accuracy of\n$91.94 \\pm 0.01$% while the SWAP test SVM achieved 96.7% on the testing\ndataset, suggesting that the kernelized classifiers are resilient to noise.\nThese are encouraging results and motivate further investigations of our\nproposed kernelized QNLP paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: The objective of this investigation is to provide a comprehensive\nanalysis of state-of-the-art methods for video-based assessment of surgical\nskill in the operating room. Methods: Using a data set of 99 videos of\ncapsulorhexis, a critical step in cataract surgery, we evaluate feature based\nmethods previously developed for surgical skill assessment mostly under\nbenchtop settings. In addition, we present and validate two deep learning\nmethods that directly assess skill using RGB videos. In the first method, we\npredict instrument tips as keypoints, and learn surgical skill using temporal\nconvolutional neural networks. In the second method, we propose a novel\narchitecture for surgical skill assessment that includes a frame-wise encoder\n(2D convolutional neural network) followed by a temporal model (recurrent\nneural network), both of which are augmented by visual attention mechanisms. We\nreport the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity,\nspecificity, and predictive values with each method through 5-fold\ncross-validation. Results: For the task of binary skill classification (expert\nvs. novice), deep neural network based methods exhibit higher AUC than the\nclassical spatiotemporal interest point based methods. The neural network\napproach using attention mechanisms also showed high sensitivity and\nspecificity. Conclusion: Deep learning methods are necessary for video-based\nassessment of surgical skill in the operating room. Our findings of internal\nvalidity of a network using attention mechanisms to assess skill directly using\nRGB videos should be evaluated for external validity in other data sets.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the multilevel Monte Carlo\nmethod (MLMC) for deterministic and uncertain hyperbolic systems, where\nrandomness is introduced either in the modeling parameters or in the\napproximation algorithms. MLMC is a well known variance reduction method widely\nused to accelerate Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. However, we demonstrate in this\npaper that for hyperbolic systems, whether MLMC can achieve a real boost turns\nout to be delicate. The computational costs of MLMC and MC depend on the\ninterplay among the accuracy (bias) and the computational cost of the numerical\nmethod for a single sample, as well as the variances of the sampled MLMC\ncorrections or MC solutions. We characterize three regimes for the MLMC and MC\nperformances using those parameters, and show that MLMC may not accelerate MC\nand can even have a higher cost when the variances of MC solutions and MLMC\ncorrections are of the same order. Our studies are carried out by a few\nprototype hyperbolic systems: a linear scalar equation, the Euler and shallow\nwater equations, and a linear relaxation model, the above statements are proved\nanalytically in some cases, and demonstrated numerically for the cases of the\nstochastic hyperbolic equations driven by white noise parameters and Glimm's\nrandom choice method for deterministic hyperbolic equations.",

However, real-world spatial data typically does not satisfy\nthe assumption of stationarity, where different locations are assumed to have\nthe same degree of variability. As a result, the prediction uncertainty does\nnot accurately capture prediction error, limiting the success of RIG\nalgorithms. We propose a novel family of nonstationary kernels, named the\nAttentive Kernel (AK), which is simple, robust, and can extend any existing\nkernel to a nonstationary one. We evaluate the new kernel in elevation mapping\ntasks, where AK provides better accuracy and uncertainty quantification over\nthe commonly used RBF kernel and other popular nonstationary kernels. The\nimproved uncertainty quantification guides the downstream RIG planner to\ncollect more valuable data around the high-error area, further increasing\nprediction accuracy.

    "abstract": "The topic of generalizing machine learning models learned on a collection of\nsource domains to unknown target domains is challenging. While many domain\ngeneralization (DG) methods have achieved promising results, they primarily\nrely on the source domains at train-time without manipulating the target\ndomains at test-time. Thus, it is still possible that those methods can overfit\nto source domains and perform poorly on target domains. Driven by the\nobservation that domains are strongly related to styles, we argue that reducing\nthe gap between source and target styles can boost models' generalizability. To\nsolve the dilemma of having no access to the target domain during training, we\nintroduce Test-time Fourier Style Calibration (TF-Cal) for calibrating the\ntarget domain style on the fly during testing. To access styles, we utilize\nFourier transformation to decompose features into amplitude (style) features\nand phase (semantic) features. Furthermore, we present an effective technique\nto Augment Amplitude Features (AAF) to complement TF-Cal. Extensive experiments\non several popular DG benchmarks and a segmentation dataset for medical images\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes Impala, a new cryptographic protocol for private\ninference in the client-cloud setting. Impala builds upon recent solutions that\ncombine the complementary strengths of homomorphic encryption (HE) and secure\nmulti-party computation (MPC). A series of protocol optimizations are developed\nto reduce both communication and performance bottlenecks. First, we remove\nMPC's overwhelmingly high communication cost from the client by introducing a\nproxy server and developing a low-overhead key switching technique. Key\nswitching reduces the clients bandwidth by multiple orders of magnitude,\nhowever the communication between the proxy and cloud is still excessive.\nSecond, to we develop an optimized garbled circuit that leverages truncated\nsecret shares for faster evaluation and less proxy-cloud communication.\nFinally, we propose sparse HE convolution to reduce the computational\nbottleneck of using HE. Compared to the state-of-the-art, these optimizations\nprovide a bandwidth savings of over 3X and speedup of 4X for private deep\nlearning inference.",

    "abstract": "Due to the labor-intensive nature of manual test oracle construction, various\nautomated testing techniques have been proposed to enhance the reliability of\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) software. In theory, these techniques mutate\nan existing test case (e.g., a sentence with its label) and assume the\ngenerated one preserves an equivalent or similar semantic meaning and thus, the\nsame label. However, in practice, many of the generated test cases fail to\npreserve similar semantic meaning and are unnatural (e.g., grammar errors),\nwhich leads to a high false alarm rate and unnatural test cases. Our evaluation\nstudy finds that 44% of the test cases generated by the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\napproaches are false alarms. These test cases require extensive manual checking\neffort, and instead of improving NLP software, they can even degrade NLP\nsoftware when utilized in model training. To address this problem, we propose\nAEON for Automatic Evaluation Of NLP test cases. For each generated test case,\nit outputs scores based on semantic similarity and language naturalness. We\nemploy AEON to evaluate test cases generated by four popular testing techniques\non five datasets across three typical NLP tasks. The results show that AEON\naligns the best with human judgment. In particular, AEON achieves the best\naverage precision in detecting semantic inconsistent test cases, outperforming\nthe best baseline metric by 10%. In addition, AEON also has the highest average\nprecision of finding unnatural test cases, surpassing the baselines by more\nthan 15%. Moreover, model training with test cases prioritized by AEON leads to\nmodels that are more accurate and robust, demonstrating AEON's potential in\nimproving NLP software.",

    "abstract": "Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has been popularly studied to utilize\ndifferent domain knowledge to solve the cold-start problem in recommender\nsystems. Most of the existing CDR models assume that both the source and target\ndomains share the same overlapped user set for knowledge transfer. However,\nonly few proportion of users simultaneously activate on both the source and\ntarget domains in practical CDR tasks. In this paper, we focus on the Partially\nOverlapped Cross-Domain Recommendation (POCDR) problem, that is, how to\nleverage the information of both the overlapped and non-overlapped users to\nimprove recommendation performance. Existing approaches cannot fully utilize\nthe useful knowledge behind the non-overlapped users across domains, which\nlimits the model performance when the majority of users turn out to be\nnon-overlapped. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end\ndual-autoencoder with Variational Domain-invariant Embedding Alignment (VDEA)\nmodel, a cross-domain recommendation framework for the POCDR problem, which\nutilizes dual variational autoencoders with both local and global embedding\nalignment for exploiting domain-invariant user embedding. VDEA first adopts\nvariational inference to capture collaborative user preferences, and then\nutilizes Gromov-Wasserstein distribution co-clustering optimal transport to\ncluster the users with similar rating interaction behaviors. Our empirical\nstudies on Douban and Amazon datasets demonstrate that VDEA significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art models, especially under the POCDR setting.",

To facilitate its wide adoption, employing NVM in managed runtimes\nlike JVM has proven to be an effective approach (i.e., managed NVM). However,\nsuch an approach is runtime specific, which lacks a generic abstraction across\ndifferent managed languages. Similar to the well-known filesystem primitives\nthat allow diverse programs to access same files via the block I/O interface,\nmanaged NVM deserves the same system-wide property for persistent objects\nacross managed runtimes with low overhead.\nIn this paper, we present UniHeap, a new NVM framework for managing\npersistent objects. It proposes a unified persistent object model that supports\nvarious managed languages, and manages NVM within a shared heap that enables\ncross-language persistent object sharing. UniHeap reduces the object\npersistence overhead by managing the shared heap in a log-structured manner and\ncoalescing object updates during the garbage collection. We implement UniHeap\nas a generic framework and extend it to different managed runtimes that include\nHotSpot JVM, cPython, and JavaScript engine SpiderMonkey.

A given\nsensor can be stimulated as the result of internally driven activity, or by\npurely external (environmental) sources. It is clear that these inputs are\nprocessed differently - have you ever tried tickling yourself? The canonical\nexplanation of this difference is that when the brain sends a signal that would\nresult in motor activity, it uses a copy of that signal to predict the sensory\nconsequences of the resulting motor activity. The predicted sensory input is\nthen subtracted from the actual sensory input, resulting in attenuation of the\nstimuli. To critically evaluate this idea, and investigate when non-predictive\nsolutions may be viable, we implement a computational model of a simple\nembodied system with self-caused sensorimotor dynamics, and analyse how\ncontrollers successfully accomplish tasks in this model. We find that in these\nsimple systems, solutions that regulate behaviour to control self-caused\nsensory inputs tend to emerge, rather than solutions which predict and filter\nout self-caused inputs.

Existing methods perform the\nsame harmonization process for the whole foreground. However, the implanted\nforeground always contains different appearance patterns.

An analysis of modularity in neural\nnetworks produced by machine learning algorithms can offer valuable insight\ninto the workings of such algorithms and how modularity can be leveraged to\nimprove performance. However, this property is often overlooked in the\nneuroevolutionary literature, so the modular nature of many learning algorithms\nis unknown.

Interestingly, NEAT tends\ntowards increasingly modular networks even when network fitness converges. It\nwas shown that the ideal level of network modularity in the explored parameter\nspace is highly dependent on other network variables, dispelling theories that\nmodularity has a straightforward relationship to network performance.

Consequently,\nthe importance of having an optimal delivery time is becoming increasingly\nevident these days. Scheduling can be used to optimize supply chains and\nproduction systems in this manner, which is one practical method for lowering\ncosts and boosting productivity. This paper suggests a multi-objective\nscheduling model for hierarchical hub structures (HHS) with three levels of\nservice. The factory and customers hub (second level) and central are on the\nfirst level in which the factory has a Flexible Flow Shop (FFS) environment.\nThe noncentral hub (third level) is responsible for the delivery of products\nmade in the factory to customers. Customer nodes and factories are connected\nseparately to the second level, and the non-central hubs are connected to the\nthird level. The model's objective is to minimize transportation and production\ncosts and product arrival times. To validate and evaluate the model, small\ninstances have been solved and analyzed in detail with the weighted sum and\ne-constraint methods. Consequently, based on the ideal mean distance (MID)\nmetric, the two methods were compared for the designed instances.

Despite its optimal asymptotic performance, OFedAvg\nsuffers from heavy communication overhead and long learning delay. To tackle\nthese shortcomings, we propose a communication-efficient OFL algorithm (named\nOFedQIT) by means of a stochastic quantization and an intermittent\ntransmission. Our major contribution is to theoretically prove that OFedQIT\nover $T$ time slots can achieve an optimal sublinear regret bound\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ for any real data (including non-IID data) while\nsignificantly reducing the communication overhead. Furthermore, this optimality\nis still guaranteed even when a small fraction of clients (having faster\nprocessing time and high-quality communication channel) in a network are\nparticipated at once.

A prominent instance of such a\ndynamical system is the system of equations governing fluid dynamics. Recent\nresearch results indicate that RL-augmented computational fluid dynamics (CFD)\nsolvers can exceed the current state of the art, for example in the field of\nturbulence modeling. However, while in supervised learning, the training data\ncan be generated a priori in an offline manner, RL requires constant run-time\ninteraction and data exchange with the CFD solver during training. In order to\nleverage the potential of RL-enhanced CFD, the interaction between the CFD\nsolver and the RL algorithm thus have to be implemented efficiently on\nhigh-performance computing (HPC) hardware.

In\naddition to prediction outputs, these APIs can also provide other information\nin a more human-understandable way, such as counterfactual explanations (CF).\nHowever, such extra information inevitably causes the cloud models to be more\nvulnerable to extraction attacks which aim to steal the internal functionality\nof models in the cloud. Due to the black-box nature of cloud models, however, a\nvast number of queries are inevitably required by existing attack strategies\nbefore the substitute model achieves high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel simple yet efficient querying strategy to greatly enhance the querying\nefficiency to steal a classification model. This is motivated by our\nobservation that current querying strategies suffer from decision boundary\nshift issue induced by taking far-distant queries and close-to-boundary CFs\ninto substitute model training. We then propose DualCF strategy to circumvent\nthe above issues, which is achieved by taking not only CF but also\ncounterfactual explanation of CF (CCF) as pairs of training samples for the\nsubstitute model.

Nonetheless, deviations from\nthis ideal geometry are considered as well. In particular, computations of the\nacoustic noise in a three-dimensional model of the helium vessel of a beamline\ncryostat with optimized Schwarz schemes are discussed. Those computations show\na reduction of 46% in the iteration count, when comparing an operator optimized\nfor cavities with those optimized for unbounded problems.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in video question answering is how to realize the cross-modal\nsemantic alignment between textual concepts and corresponding visual objects.\nExisting methods mostly seek to align the word representations with the video\nregions. However, word representations are often not able to convey a complete\ndescription of textual concepts, which are in general described by the\ncompositions of certain words. To address this issue, we propose to first build\na syntactic dependency tree for each question with an off-the-shelf tool and\nuse it to guide the extraction of meaningful word compositions. Based on the\nextracted compositions, a hypergraph is further built by viewing the words as\nnodes and the compositions as hyperedges. Hypergraph convolutional networks\n(HCN) are then employed to learn the initial representations of word\ncompositions. Afterwards, an optimal transport based method is proposed to\nperform cross-modal semantic alignment for the textual and visual semantic\nspace. To reflect the cross-modal influences, the cross-modal information is\nincorporated into the initial representations, leading to a model named\ncross-modality-aware syntactic HCN. Experimental results on three benchmarks\nshow that our method outperforms all strong baselines. Further analyses\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of each component, and show that our model is\ngood at modeling different levels of semantic compositions and filtering out\nirrelevant information.",

    "title": "Addressing Confounding Feature Issue for Causal Recommendation",
    "abstract": "In recommender system, some feature directly affects whether an interaction\nwould happen, making the happened interactions not necessarily indicate user\npreference. For instance, short videos are objectively easier to be finished\neven though the user does not like the video. We term such feature as\nconfounding feature, and video length is a confounding feature in video\nrecommendation. If we fit a model on such interaction data, just as done by\nmost data-driven recommender systems, the model will be biased to recommend\nshort videos more, and deviate from user actual requirement.\nThis work formulates and addresses the problem from the causal perspective.\nAssuming there are some factors affecting both the confounding feature and\nother item features, e.g., the video creator, we find the confounding feature\nopens a backdoor path behind user item matching and introduces spurious\ncorrelation. To remove the effect of backdoor path, we propose a framework\nnamed Deconfounding Causal Recommendation (DCR), which performs intervened\ninference with do-calculus. Nevertheless, evaluating do calculus requires to\nsum over the prediction on all possible values of confounding feature,\nsignificantly increasing the time cost. To address the efficiency challenge, we\nfurther propose a mixture-of experts (MoE) model architecture, modeling each\nvalue of confounding feature with a separate expert module. Through this way,\nwe retain the model expressiveness with few additional costs. We demonstrate\nDCR on the backbone model of neural factorization machine (NFM), showing that\nDCR leads to more accurate prediction of user preference with small inference\ntime cost.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is a growing technology that relies on connected\n'things' that gather data from peer devices and send data to servers via APIs\n(Application Programming Interfaces). The design quality of those APIs has a\ndirect impact on their understandability and reusability. This study focuses on\nthe linguistic design quality of REST APIs for IoT applications and assesses\ntheir linguistic quality by performing the detection of linguistic patterns and\nantipatterns in REST APIs for IoT applications. Linguistic antipatterns are\nconsidered poor practices in the naming, documentation, and choice of\nidentifiers. In contrast, linguistic patterns represent best practices to APIs\ndesign. The linguistic patterns and their corresponding antipatterns are hence\ncontrasting pairs. We propose the SARAv2 (Semantic Analysis of REST APIs\nversion two) approach to perform syntactic and semantic analyses of REST APIs\nfor IoT applications. Based on the SARAv2 approach, we develop the REST-Ling\ntool and empirically validate the detection results of nine linguistic\nantipatterns. We analyse 19 REST APIs for IoT applications. Our detection\nresults show that the linguistic antipatterns are prevalent and the REST-Ling\ntool can detect linguistic patterns and antipatterns in REST APIs for IoT\napplications with an average accuracy of over 80%. Moreover, the tool performs\nthe detection of linguistic antipatterns on average in the order of seconds,\ni.e., 8.396 seconds. We found that APIs generally follow good linguistic\npractices, although the prevalence of poor practices exists.",

    "title": "A Self-aware Personal Assistant for Making Personalized Privacy  Decisions",
    "abstract": "Many software systems, such as online social networks enable users to share\ninformation about themselves. While the action of sharing is simple, it\nrequires an elaborate thought process on privacy: what to share, with whom to\nshare, and for what purposes. Thinking about these for each piece of content to\nbe shared is tedious. Recent approaches to tackle this problem build personal\nassistants that can help users by learning what is private over time and\nrecommending privacy labels such as private or public to individual content\nthat a user considers sharing. However, privacy is inherently ambiguous and\nhighly personal. Existing approaches to recommend privacy decisions do not\naddress these aspects of privacy sufficiently. Ideally, a personal assistant\nshould be able to adjust its recommendation based on a given user, considering\nthat user's privacy understanding. Moreover, the personal assistant should be\nable to assess when its recommendation would be uncertain and let the user make\nthe decision on her own. Accordingly, this paper proposes a personal assistant\nthat uses evidential deep learning to classify content based on its privacy\nlabel. An important characteristic of the personal assistant is that it can\nmodel its uncertainty in its decisions explicitly, determine that it does not\nknow the answer, and delegate from making a recommendation when its uncertainty\nis high. By factoring in the user's own understanding of privacy, such as risk\nfactors or own labels, the personal assistant can personalize its\nrecommendations per user. We evaluate our proposed personal assistant using a\nwell-known data set. Our results show that our personal assistant can\naccurately identify uncertain cases, personalize them to its user's needs, and\nthus helps users preserve their privacy well.",

In this paper, we aim\nto systematically and scientifically study this bias from both data and\nalgorithm aspects. First, using the dermatologist approved Fitzpatrick Skin\nType classification system and Individual Typology Angle, we contribute a\nbenchmark called Identity Shades (IDS) database, which effectively quantifies\nthe degree of the bias with respect to skin tone in existing face recognition\nalgorithms and commercial APIs. Further, we provide two skin-tone aware\ntraining datasets, called BUPT-Globalface dataset and BUPT-Balancedface\ndataset, to remove bias in training data. Finally, to mitigate the algorithmic\nbias, we propose a novel meta-learning algorithm, called Meta Balanced Network\n(MBN), which learns adaptive margins in large margin loss such that the model\noptimized by this loss can perform fairly across people with different skin\ntones. To determine the margins, our method optimizes a meta skewness loss on a\nclean and unbiased meta set and utilizes backward-on-backward automatic\ndifferentiation to perform a second order gradient descent step on the current\nmargins. Extensive experiments show that MBN successfully mitigates bias and\nlearns more balanced performance for people with different skin tones in face\nrecognition.

Therefore, we aim to explore unsupervised domain adaptation\nto transfer knowledge from handprinted oracle data, which are easy to acquire,\nto scanned domain. We propose a structure-texture separation network (STSN),\nwhich is an end-to-end learning framework for joint disentanglement,\ntransformation, adaptation and recognition. First, STSN disentangles features\ninto structure (glyph) and texture (noise) components by generative models, and\nthen aligns handprinted and scanned data in structure feature space such that\nthe negative influence caused by serious noises can be avoided when adapting.\nSecond, transformation is achieved via swapping the learned textures across\ndomains and a classifier for final classification is trained to predict the\nlabels of the transformed scanned characters. This not only guarantees the\nabsolute separation, but also enhances the discriminative ability of the\nlearned features. Extensive experiments on Oracle-241 dataset show that STSN\noutperforms other adaptation methods and successfully improves recognition\nperformance on scanned data even when they are contaminated by long burial and\ncareless excavation.",

To achieve high-fidelity data for training intelligent systems,\nwe have built a 3D scenario and set-up to resemble reality as closely as\npossible. With our approach, it is possible to configure and vary parameters to\nadd randomness to the scene and, in this way, allow variation in data, which is\nso important in the construction of a dataset. Besides, the annotation task is\nalready included in the data generation exercise, rather than being a\npost-capture task, which can save a lot of resources.

    "title": "Balanced Allocations: The Heavily Loaded Case with Deletions",
    "abstract": "In the 2-choice allocation problem, $m$ balls are placed into $n$ bins, and\neach ball must choose between two random bins $i, j \\in [n]$ that it has been\nassigned to. It has been known for more than two decades, that if each ball\nfollows the Greedy strategy (i.e., always pick the less-full bin), then the\nmaximum load will be $m/n + O(\\log \\log n)$ with high probability in $n$ (and\n$m / n + O(\\log m)$ with high probability in $m$). It has remained open whether\nthe same bounds hold in the dynamic version of the same game, where balls are\ninserted/deleted with up to $m$ balls present at a time.\nWe show that these bounds do not hold in the dynamic setting: already on $4$\nbins, there exists a sequence of insertions/deletions that cause {Greedy} to\nincur a maximum load of $m/4 + \\Omega(\\sqrt{m})$ with probability $\\Omega(1)$\n-- this is the same bound as if each ball is simply assigned to a random bin!\nThis raises the question of whether any 2-choice allocation strategy can\noffer a strong bound in the dynamic setting. Our second result answers this\nquestion in the affirmative: we present a new strategy, called ModulatedGreedy,\nthat guarantees a maximum load of $m / n + O(\\log m)$, at any given moment,\nwith high probability in $m$. Generalizing ModulatedGreedy, we obtain dynamic\nguarantees for the $(1 + \\beta)$-choice setting, and for the setting of\nballs-and-bins on a graph.\nFinally, we consider a setting in which balls can be reinserted after they\nare deleted, and where the pair $i, j$ that a given ball uses is consistent\nacross insertions. This seemingly small modification renders tight load\nbalancing impossible: on 4 bins, any strategy that is oblivious to the specific\nidentities of balls must allow for a maximum load of $m/4 + poly(m)$ at some\npoint in the first $poly(m)$ insertions/deletions, with high probability in\n$m$.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding research has mainly focused on learning continuous\nrepresentations of entities and relations tailored towards the link prediction\nproblem. Recent results indicate an ever increasing predictive ability of\ncurrent approaches on benchmark datasets. However, this effectiveness often\ncomes with the cost of over-parameterization and increased computationally\ncomplexity. The former induces extensive hyperparameter optimization to\nmitigate malicious overfitting. The latter magnifies the importance of winning\nthe hardware lottery. Here, we investigate a remedy for the first problem. We\npropose a technique based on Kronecker decomposition to reduce the number of\nparameters in a knowledge graph embedding model, while retaining its\nexpressiveness. Through Kronecker decomposition, large embedding matrices are\nsplit into smaller embedding matrices during the training process. Hence,\nembeddings of knowledge graphs are not plainly retrieved but reconstructed on\nthe fly. The decomposition ensures that elementwise interactions between three\nembedding vectors are extended with interactions within each embedding vector.\nThis implicitly reduces redundancy in embedding vectors and encourages feature\nreuse. To quantify the impact of applying Kronecker decomposition on embedding\nmatrices, we conduct a series of experiments on benchmark datasets. Our\nexperiments suggest that applying Kronecker decomposition on embedding matrices\nleads to an improved parameter efficiency on all benchmark datasets. Moreover,\nempirical evidence suggests that reconstructed embeddings entail robustness\nagainst noise in the input knowledge graph. To foster reproducible research, we\nprovide an open-source implementation of our approach, including training and\nevaluation scripts as well as pre-trained models in our knowledge graph\nembedding framework (https://github.com/dice-group/dice-embeddings).",

We evaluate the\nviability of our attacks in two ways.

    "abstract": "Existing approaches on Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) have\nweak generalizability. That is often due to the standard i.i.d. assumption on\nthe underlying dataset. Recently, three levels of generalization for KGQA were\ndefined, namely i.i.d., compositional, zero-shot. We analyze 25 well-known KGQA\ndatasets for 5 different Knowledge Graphs (KGs). We show that according to this\ndefinition many existing and online available KGQA datasets are either not\nsuited to train a generalizable KGQA system or that the datasets are based on\ndiscontinued and out-dated KGs. Generating new datasets is a costly process\nand, thus, is not an alternative to smaller research groups and companies.

Although the classic numerical\nintegration method, \\textit{i.e.} time-domain simulation (TDS), has been widely\nused in industry practice, it is inevitably trapped in a high computational\ncomplexity due to the high latitude sophistication of the power system. In this\nwork, a data-driven power system estimation method is proposed to quickly\npredict the stability of the power system before TDS reaches the end of\nsimulating time windows, which can reduce the average simulation time of\nstability assessment without loss of accuracy.

We propose an event-based control protocol for achieving the\nsynchronization among agents in the mean square sense and theoretically analyze\nthe performance of it by using a stochastic Lyapunov function, where the\nstability of $c$-martingales is particularly developed to handle the challenges\nbrought by the general model of noises and the event-triggering mechanism. The\nproposed event-based synchronization algorithm is then applied to solve the\nproblem of distributed estimation in sensor network. Specifically, by\nlosslessly decomposing the optimal Kalman filter, it is shown that the problem\nof distributed estimation can be resolved by using the algorithms designed for\nachieving the synchronization of stochastic linear systems. As such, an\nevent-based distributed estimation algorithm is developed, where each sensor\nperforms local filtering solely using its own measurement, together with the\nproposed event-based synchronization algorithm to fuse the local estimates of\nneighboring nodes. With the reduced communication frequency, the designed\nestimator is proved to be stable under the minimal requirements of network\nconnectivity and collective system observability.",

    "abstract": "Vocabulary selection, or lexical shortlisting, is a well-known technique to\nimprove latency of Neural Machine Translation models by constraining the set of\nallowed output words during inference. The chosen set is typically determined\nby separately trained alignment model parameters, independent of the\nsource-sentence context at inference time. While vocabulary selection appears\ncompetitive with respect to automatic quality metrics in prior work, we show\nthat it can fail to select the right set of output words, particularly for\nsemantically non-compositional linguistic phenomena such as idiomatic\nexpressions, leading to reduced translation quality as perceived by humans.\nTrading off latency for quality by increasing the size of the allowed set is\noften not an option in real-world scenarios. We propose a model of vocabulary\nselection, integrated into the neural translation model, that predicts the set\nof allowed output words from contextualized encoder representations. This\nrestores translation quality of an unconstrained system, as measured by human\nevaluations on WMT newstest2020 and idiomatic expressions, at an inference\nlatency competitive with alignment-based selection using aggressive thresholds,\nthereby removing the dependency on separately trained alignment models.",

However, as we move towards a hybrid human-machine\nfuture, it is still unclear how the introduction of AI agents in our social\ninteractions will affect this cooperative capacity. Within the context of the\none-shot collective risk dilemma, where enough members of a group must\ncooperate in order to avoid a collective disaster, we study the evolutionary\ndynamics of cooperation in a hybrid population made of both adaptive and\nfixed-behavior agents. Specifically, we show how the first learn to adapt their\nbehavior to compensate for the behavior of the latter. The less the\n(artificially) fixed agents cooperate, the more the adaptive population is\nmotivated to cooperate, and vice-versa, especially when the risk is higher. By\npinpointing how adaptive agents avoid their share of costly cooperation if the\nfixed-behavior agents implement a cooperative policy, our work hints towards an\nunbalanced hybrid world. On one hand, this means that introducing cooperative\nAI agents within our society might unburden human efforts. Nevertheless, it is\nimportant to note that costless artificial cooperation might not be realistic,\nand more than deploying AI systems that carry the cooperative effort, we must\nfocus on mechanisms that nudge shared cooperation among all members in the\nhybrid system.",

    "abstract": "Roadside units (RSUs), which have strong computing capability and are close\nto vehicle nodes, have been widely used to process delay- and\ncomputation-intensive tasks of vehicle nodes. However, due to their high\nmobility, vehicles may drive out of the coverage of RSUs before receiving the\ntask processing results. In this paper, we propose a mobile edge\ncomputing-assisted vehicular network, where vehicles can offload their tasks to\na nearby vehicle via a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) link or a nearby RSU via a\nvehicle-to-infrastructure link. These tasks are also migrated by a V2V link or\nan infrastructure-to-infrastructure (I2I) link to avoid the scenario where the\nvehicles cannot receive the processed task from the RSUs. Considering mutual\ninterference from the same link of offloading tasks and migrating tasks, we\nconstruct a vehicle offloading decision-based game to minimize the computation\noverhead. We prove that the game can always achieve Nash equilibrium and\nconvergence by exploiting the finite improvement property. We then propose a\ntask migration (TM) algorithm that includes three task-processing methods and\ntwo task-migration methods. Based on the TM algorithm, computation overhead\nminimization offloading (COMO) algorithm is presented. Extensive simulation\nresults show that the proposed TM and COMO algorithms reduce the computation\noverhead and increase the success rate of task processing.",

In\nthis paper, we address the convergence of the FL process in dynamic\ncybersecurity scenarios, where the trained model must be frequently updated\nwith new recent attack profiles to empower all members of the federation with\nlatest detection features. To this aim, we propose FLAD (adaptive Federated\nLearning Approach to DDoS attack detection), a FL solution for cybersecurity\napplications based on an adaptive mechanism that orchestrates the FL process by\ndynamically assigning more computation to those members whose attacks profiles\nare harder to learn, without the need of sharing any test data to monitor the\nperformance of the trained model. Using a recent dataset of DDoS attacks, we\ndemonstrate that FLAD outperforms the original FL algorithm in terms of\nconvergence time and accuracy across a range of unbalanced datasets of\nheterogeneous DDoS attacks. We also show the robustness of our approach in a\nrealistic scenario, where we retrain the deep learning model multiple times to\nintroduce the profiles of new attacks on a pre-trained model.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new approach for unsupervised learning of hyperelastic\nconstitutive laws with physics-consistent deep neural networks. In contrast to\nsupervised learning, which assumes the availability of stress-strain pairs, the\napproach only uses realistically measurable full-field displacement and global\nreaction force data, thus it lies within the scope of our recent framework for\nEfficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law Identification and Discovery (EUCLID)\nand we denote it as NN-EUCLID. The absence of stress labels is compensated for\nby leveraging a physics-motivated loss function based on the conservation of\nlinear momentum to guide the learning process. The constitutive model is based\non input-convex neural networks, which are capable of learning a function that\nis convex with respect to its inputs. By employing a specially designed neural\nnetwork architecture, multiple physical and thermodynamic constraints for\nhyperelastic constitutive laws, such as material frame indifference,\n(poly-)convexity, and stress-free reference configuration are automatically\nsatisfied. We demonstrate the ability of the approach to accurately learn\nseveral hidden isotropic and anisotropic hyperelastic constitutive laws -\nincluding e.g., Mooney-Rivlin, Arruda-Boyce, Ogden, and Holzapfel models -\nwithout using stress data. For anisotropic hyperelasticity, the unknown\nanisotropic fiber directions are automatically discovered jointly with the\nconstitutive model. The neural network-based constitutive models show good\ngeneralization capability beyond the strain states observed during training and\nare readily deployable in a general finite element framework for simulating\ncomplex mechanical boundary value problems with good accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In this work, a 2D contour generation algorithm is proposed for irregular\nregions. The contour of the physical domain is approximated by mesh segments\nusing the known coordinates of the contour. For this purpose, the algorithm\nuses a repeating structure that analyzes the known irregular contour\ncoordinates to approximate the physical domain contour by mesh segments. To\nthis end, the algorithm calculates the slope of the line defined by the known\npoint of the irregular contours and the neighboring vertices. In this way, the\nalgorithm calculates the points of the line and its distance to the closest\nknown nodes of the mesh, allowing to obtain the points of the approximate\ncontour. This process is repeated until the approximate contour is obtained.\nTherefore, this approximate contour generation algorithm, from known nodes of a\nmesh, is suitable for describing meshes involving geometries with irregular\ncontours and for calculating finite differences in numerical simulations. The\ncontour is evaluated through three geometries, the difference between the areas\ndelimited by the given contour and the approximate contour, the number of nodes\nand the number of internal points. It can be seen that the increase in geometry\ncomplexity implies the need for a greater number of nodes in the contour,\ngenerating more refined meshes that allow reaching differences in areas below\n2%.",

    "abstract": "A Bayesian Deep Restricted Boltzmann-Kohonen architecture for data clustering\ntermed as DRBM-ClustNet is proposed. This core-clustering engine consists of a\nDeep Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DRBM) for processing unlabeled data by\ncreating new features that are uncorrelated and have large variance with each\nother. Next, the number of clusters are predicted using the Bayesian\nInformation Criterion (BIC), followed by a Kohonen Network-based clustering\nlayer. The processing of unlabeled data is done in three stages for efficient\nclustering of the non-linearly separable datasets. In the first stage, DRBM\nperforms non-linear feature extraction by capturing the highly complex data\nrepresentation by projecting the feature vectors of $d$ dimensions into $n$\ndimensions. Most clustering algorithms require the number of clusters to be\ndecided a priori, hence here to automate the number of clusters in the second\nstage we use BIC. In the third stage, the number of clusters derived from BIC\nforms the input for the Kohonen network, which performs clustering of the\nfeature-extracted data obtained from the DRBM. This method overcomes the\ngeneral disadvantages of clustering algorithms like the prior specification of\nthe number of clusters, convergence to local optima and poor clustering\naccuracy on non-linear datasets. In this research we use two synthetic\ndatasets, fifteen benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository,\nand four image datasets to analyze the DRBM-ClustNet. The proposed framework is\nevaluated based on clustering accuracy and ranked against other\nstate-of-the-art clustering methods. The obtained results demonstrate that the\nDRBM-ClustNet outperforms state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.",

In this work, we propose a novel {\\em\n\\modelname{}} ({\\bf\\em \\shortname{})} method dedicated for distilling\nrepresentational knowledge semantically from a pretrained teacher to a target\nstudent. The key idea is that we leverage the teacher's classifier as a\nsemantic critic for evaluating the representations of both teacher and student\nand distilling the semantic knowledge with high-order structured information\nover all feature dimensions. This is accomplished by introducing a notion of\ncross-network logit computed through passing student's representation into\nteacher's classifier. Further, considering the set of seen classes as a basis\nfor the semantic space in a combinatorial perspective, we scale \\shortname{} to\nunseen classes for enabling effective exploitation of largely available,\narbitrary unlabeled training data. At the problem level, this establishes an\ninteresting connection between knowledge distillation with open-set\nsemi-supervised learning (SSL).

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in the field of unsupervised machine learning is the\ndetection of anomalies corresponding to rare and unusual observations of\ninterest; reasons include for their rejection, accommodation or further\ninvestigation. Anomalies are intuitively understood to be something unusual or\ninconsistent, whose occurrence sparks immediate attention. More formally\nanomalies are those observations-under appropriate random variable\nmodelling-whose expectation of occurrence with respect to a grouping of prior\ninterest is less than one; such a definition and understanding has been used to\ndevelop the parameter-free perception anomaly detection algorithm. The present\nwork seeks to establish important and practical connections between the\napproach used by the perception algorithm and prior decades of research in\nneurophysiology and computational neuroscience; particularly that of\ninformation processing in the retina and visual cortex. The algorithm is\nconceptualised as a neuron model which forms the kernel of an unsupervised\nneural network that learns to signal unexpected observations as anomalies. Both\nthe network and neuron display properties observed in biological processes\nincluding: immediate intelligence; parallel processing; redundancy; global\ndegradation; contrast invariance; parameter-free computation, dynamic\nthresholds and non-linear processing. A robust and accurate model for anomaly\ndetection in univariate and multivariate data is built using this network as a\nconcrete application.",

Although various approaches for automatic analysis exist\nand are the subject of ongoing research, analysts often have to resort to\nmanual static analysis to get a deep understanding of a given binary sample.\nSince the source code of encountered samples is rarely available, analysts\nregularly employ decompilers for easier and faster comprehension than analyzing\na binary's disassembly.\nIn this paper, we introduce our decompilation approach dewolf. We developed a\nvariety of improvements over the previous academic state-of-the-art decompiler\nand some novel algorithms to enhance readability and comprehension, focusing on\nmanual analysis. To evaluate our approach and to obtain a better insight into\nthe analysts' needs, we conducted three user surveys. The results indicate that\ndewolf is suitable for malware comprehension and that its output quality\nnoticeably exceeds Ghidra and Hex-Rays in certain aspects. Furthermore, our\nresults imply that decompilers aiming at manual analysis should be highly\nconfigurable to respect individual user preferences. Additionally, future\ndecompilers should not necessarily follow the unwritten rule to stick to the\ncode-structure dictated by the assembly in order to produce readable output. In\nfact, the few cases where dewolf already cracks this rule lead to its results\nconsiderably exceeding other decompilers.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been at the forefront of the\nrecent advances in this field. One popular CNN-based approach involves the\napplication of generated kernels to the input frames to obtain an interpolated\nframe. Despite all the benefits interpolation methods offer, many of these\nnetworks require a lot of parameters, with more parameters meaning a heavier\ncomputational burden. Reducing the size of the model typically impacts\nperformance negatively. This paper presents a method for parameter reduction\nfor a popular flow-less kernel-based network (Adaptive Collaboration of Flows).\nThrough our technique of removing the layers that require the most parameters\nand replacing them with smaller encoders, we reduce the number of parameters of\nthe network and even achieve better performance compared to the original\nmethod.

However, so far, most\nlong-term policies to decrease the carbon footprint of our societies consider\nthe cost of the system as the leading indicator in the energy system models. To\naddress this gap, we developed a new approach by adding the energy return on\ninvestment (EROI) in a whole-energy system model. We built the database with\nall EROI technologies and resources considered. This novel model is applied to\nthe Belgian energy system in 2035 for several greenhouse gas emissions targets.\nHowever, moving away from fossil-based to carbon-neutral energy systems raises\nthe issue of the uncertainty of low-carbon technologies and resource data.\nThus, we conduct a global sensitivity analysis to identify the main parameters\ndriving the variations in the EROI of the system.\nIn this case study, the main results are threefold: (i) the EROI of the\nsystem decreases from 8.9 to 3.9 when greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by\n5; (ii) the renewable fuels - mainly imported renewable gas - represent the\nlargest share of the system primary energy mix due to the lack of endogenous\nrenewable resources such as wind and solar; (iii) in the sensitivity analysis,\nthe renewable fuels drive 67% of the variation of the EROI of the system for\nlow greenhouse gas emissions scenarios.

Recent work sees two main reasons for this: (1) popular tokenisation\nalgorithms are optimized for common words, and therefore have limited\nexpressiveness for numbers, and (2) common pretraining objectives do not target\nnumerical reasoning or understanding numbers at all. Recent approaches usually\naddress them separately and mostly by proposing architectural changes or\npretraining models from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new extended\npretraining approach called reasoning-aware pretraining to jointly address both\nshortcomings without requiring architectural changes or pretraining from\nscratch. Using contrastive learning, our approach incorporates an alternative\nnumber representation into an already pretrained model, while improving its\nnumerical reasoning skills by training on a novel pretraining objective called\ninferable number prediction task. We evaluate our approach on three different\ntasks that require numerical reasoning, including (a) reading comprehension in\nthe DROP dataset, (b) inference-on-tables in the InfoTabs dataset, and (c)\ntable-to-text generation in WikiBio and SciGen datasets. Our results on DROP\nand InfoTabs show that our approach improves the accuracy by 9.6 and 33.9\npoints on these datasets, respectively.

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that systems for speech translation (ST) -- similarly\nto automatic speech recognition (ASR) -- poorly handle person names. This\nshortcoming does not only lead to errors that can seriously distort the meaning\nof the input, but also hinders the adoption of such systems in application\nscenarios (like computer-assisted interpreting) where the translation of named\nentities, like person names, is crucial. In this paper, we first analyse the\noutputs of ASR/ST systems to identify the reasons of failures in person name\ntranscription/translation. Besides the frequency in the training data, we\npinpoint the nationality of the referred person as a key factor. We then\nmitigate the problem by creating multilingual models, and further improve our\nST systems by forcing them to jointly generate transcripts and translations,\nprioritising the former over the latter. Overall, our solutions result in a\nrelative improvement in token-level person name accuracy by 47.8% on average\nfor three language pairs (en->es,fr,it).",

    "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence often stem from the development of new\nenvironments that abstract real-world situations into a form where research can\nbe done conveniently. This paper contributes such an environment based on ideas\ninspired by elementary Microeconomics. Agents learn to produce resources in a\nspatially complex world, trade them with one another, and consume those that\nthey prefer. We show that the emergent production, consumption, and pricing\nbehaviors respond to environmental conditions in the directions predicted by\nsupply and demand shifts in Microeconomics. We also demonstrate settings where\nthe agents' emergent prices for goods vary over space, reflecting the local\nabundance of goods. After the price disparities emerge, some agents then\ndiscover a niche of transporting goods between regions with different\nprevailing prices -- a profitable strategy because they can buy goods where\nthey are cheap and sell them where they are expensive. Finally, in a series of\nablation experiments, we investigate how choices in the environmental rewards,\nbartering actions, agent architecture, and ability to consume tradable goods\ncan either aid or inhibit the emergence of this economic behavior. This work is\npart of the environment development branch of a research program that aims to\nbuild human-like artificial general intelligence through multi-agent\ninteractions in simulated societies. By exploring which environment features\nare needed for the basic phenomena of elementary microeconomics to emerge\nautomatically from learning, we arrive at an environment that differs from\nthose studied in prior multi-agent reinforcement learning work along several\ndimensions. For example, the model incorporates heterogeneous tastes and\nphysical abilities, and agents negotiate with one another as a grounded form of\ncommunication.",

Methods: We\ninvited one researcher for each of the disciplinary areas represented within\nthe department and all 19 accepted to participate in the study. We divided\nparticipants into 5 main research areas: philology and literary criticism,\nlanguage and linguistics, history of art, computer science, archival studies.\nThe interviews were transcribed and analysed using a grounded theory approach.\nResults: A list of 13 research data types in the humanities has been compiled\nthanks to the information collected from participants; publications emerge as\nthe most important one. The term \"data\" does not seem to be especially\nproblematic, contrary to what has been reported elsewhere. Regarding current\nresearch and data management practices, methodologies and teamwork appear more\ncentral than previously reported. Conclusions: \"Data\" in the FAIR framework\nneed to include all types of input and outputs humanities research work with,\nincluding publications.

    "abstract": "Information-theoretic fitness functions are becoming increasingly popular to\nproduce generally useful, task-independent behaviors. One such universal\nfunction, dubbed empowerment, measures the amount of control an agent exerts on\nits environment via its sensorimotor system. Specifically, empowerment attempts\nto maximize the mutual information between an agent's actions and its received\nsensor states at a later point in time. Traditionally, empowerment has been\napplied to a conventional sensorimotor apparatus, such as a robot. Here, we\nexpand the approach to a distributed, multi-agent sensorimotor system embodied\nby a neural cellular automaton (NCA). We show that the addition of empowerment\nas a secondary objective in the evolution of NCA to perform the task of\nmorphogenesis, growing and maintaining a pre-specified shape, results in higher\nfitness compared to evolving for morphogenesis alone. Results suggest there may\nbe a synergistic relationship between morphogenesis and empowerment. That is,\nindirectly selecting for coordination between neighboring cells over the\nduration of development is beneficial to the developmental process itself. Such\na finding may have applications in developmental biology by providing potential\nmechanisms of communication between cells during growth from a single cell to a\nmulticellular, target morphology.

    "abstract": "The goal of open-world compositional zero-shot learning (OW-CZSL) is to\nrecognize compositions of state and objects in images, given only a subset of\nthem during training and no prior on the unseen compositions. In this setting,\nmodels operate on a huge output space, containing all possible state-object\ncompositions. While previous works tackle the problem by learning embeddings\nfor the compositions jointly, here we revisit a simple CZSL baseline and\npredict the primitives, i.e. states and objects, independently. To ensure that\nthe model develops primitive-specific features, we equip the state and object\nclassifiers with separate, non-linear feature extractors. Moreover, we estimate\nthe feasibility of each composition through external knowledge, using this\nprior to remove unfeasible compositions from the output space. Finally, we\npropose a new setting, i.e. CZSL under partial supervision (pCZSL), where\neither only objects or state labels are available during training, and we can\nuse our prior to estimate the missing labels. Our model, Knowledge-Guided\nSimple Primitives (KG-SP), achieves state of the art in both OW-CZSL and pCZSL,\nsurpassing most recent competitors even when coupled with semi-supervised\nlearning techniques.

    "abstract": "Distributed storage systems must store large amounts of data over long\nperiods of time. To avoid data loss due to device failures, an $[n,k]$ erasure\ncode is used to encode $k$ data symbols into a codeword of $n$ symbols that are\nstored across different devices. However, device failure rates change\nthroughout the life of the data, and tuning $n$ and $k$ according to these\nchanges has been shown to save significant storage space. Code conversion is\nthe process of converting multiple codewords of an initial $[n^I,k^I]$ code\ninto codewords of a final $[n^F,k^F]$ code that decode to the same set of data\nsymbols. In this paper, we study conversion bandwidth, defined as the total\namount of data transferred between nodes during conversion. In particular, we\nconsider the case where the initial and final codes are MDS and a single\ninitial codeword is split into several final codewords ($k^I=\\lambda^F k^F$ for\ninteger $\\lambda^F \\geq 2$), called the split regime.

This phenomenon is due to\nthe fact that KRR sequentially learns functions of increasing complexity as the\nsample size increases; when $d^{k-1}\\ll n\\ll d^{k}$, only polynomials with\ndegree less than $k$ are learned. In this paper, we present sharp asymptotic\ncharacterization of the performance of KRR at the critical transition regions\nwith $n \\asymp d^k$, for $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}$. Our asymptotic characterization\nprovides a precise picture of the whole learning process and clarifies the\nimpact of various parameters (including the choice of the kernel function) on\nthe generalization performance. In particular, we show that the learning curves\nof KRR can have a delicate \"double descent\" behavior due to specific\nbias-variance trade-offs at different polynomial scaling regimes.",

Most other works using reinforcement learning to\ncontrol or schedule transmissions use some centralized control mechanism,\nwhereas our approach is fully distributed. Each transmitter node is an\nindependent reinforcement learning agent and does not have direct knowledge of\nthe actions taken by other agents. We consider the case where only a subset of\nagents can successfully transmit at a time, so each agent must learn to act\ncooperatively with other agents. An agent may decide to transmit a certain\nnumber of steps into the future, but this decision is not communicated to the\nother agents, so it the task of the individual agents to attempt to transmit at\nappropriate times. We achieve this collaborative behavior through studying the\neffects of different actions spaces. We are agnostic to the physical layer,\nwhich makes our approach applicable to many types of networks. We submit that\napproaches similar to ours may be useful in other domains that use multi-agent\nreinforcement learning with independent agents.",

User\ndemographics provide rich information that could help study the subject\nfurther. However, user demographics such as gender are considered private and\nare not freely available. In this study, we propose a model based on\ntransformers to predict the user's gender from their images and tweets.

Next, we fine-tune another model based on Bidirectional Encoders\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) to recognize the user's gender by\ntheir tweets. This is highly beneficial, because not all users provide an image\nthat indicates their gender. The gender of such users could be detected form\ntheir tweets.

    "abstract": "Although generative facial prior and geometric prior have recently\ndemonstrated high-quality results for blind face restoration, producing\nfine-grained facial details faithful to inputs remains a challenging problem.\nMotivated by the classical dictionary-based methods and the recent vector\nquantization (VQ) technique, we propose a VQ-based face restoration method --\nVQFR. VQFR takes advantage of high-quality low-level feature banks extracted\nfrom high-quality faces and can thus help recover realistic facial details.\nHowever, the simple application of the VQ codebook cannot achieve good results\nwith faithful details and identity preservation. Therefore, we further\nintroduce two special network designs. 1). We first investigate the compression\npatch size in the VQ codebook and find that the VQ codebook designed with a\nproper compression patch size is crucial to balance the quality and fidelity.\n2). To further fuse low-level features from inputs while not \"contaminating\"\nthe realistic details generated from the VQ codebook, we proposed a parallel\ndecoder consisting of a texture decoder and a main decoder. Those two decoders\nthen interact with a texture warping module with deformable convolution.\nEquipped with the VQ codebook as a facial detail dictionary and the parallel\ndecoder design, the proposed VQFR can largely enhance the restored quality of\nfacial details while keeping the fidelity to previous methods.

Critically, the statistical protocol used to establish efficacy\naffects the behavior of a strategic, self-interested pharmaceutical company; a\nlower standard of statistical evidence incentivizes the pharmaceutical company\nto run more trials for drugs that are less likely to be effective, since the\ndrug may pass the trial by chance, resulting in large profits.

    "abstract": "Can a micron sized sack of interacting molecules understand, and adapt to a\nconstantly-fluctuating environment? Cellular life provides an existence proof\nin the affirmative, but the principles that allow for life's existence are far\nfrom being proven. One challenge in engineering and understanding biochemical\ncomputation is the intrinsic noise due to chemical fluctuations. In this paper,\nwe draw insights from machine learning theory, chemical reaction network\ntheory, and statistical physics to show that the broad and biologically\nrelevant class of detailed balanced chemical reaction networks is capable of\nrepresenting and conditioning complex distributions. These results illustrate\nhow a biochemical computer can use intrinsic chemical noise to perform complex\ncomputations. Furthermore, we use our explicit physical model to derive\nthermodynamic costs of inference.",

    "abstract": "Ptychography is a popular microscopic imaging modality for many scientific\ndiscoveries and sets the record for highest image resolution. Unfortunately,\nthe high image resolution for ptychographic reconstruction requires significant\namount of memory and computations, forcing many applications to compromise\ntheir image resolution in exchange for a smaller memory footprint and a shorter\nreconstruction time. In this paper, we propose a novel image gradient\ndecomposition method that significantly reduces the memory footprint for\nptychographic reconstruction by tessellating image gradients and diffraction\nmeasurements into tiles. In addition, we propose a parallel image gradient\ndecomposition method that enables asynchronous point-to-point communications\nand parallel pipelining with minimal overhead on a large number of GPUs. Our\nexperiments on a Titanate material dataset (PbTiO3) with 16632 probe locations\nshow that our Gradient Decomposition algorithm reduces memory footprint by 51\ntimes. In addition, it achieves time-to-solution within 2.2 minutes by scaling\nto 4158 GPUs with a super-linear speedup at 364% efficiency. This performance\nis 2.7 times more memory efficient, 9 times more scalable and 86 times faster\nthan the state-of-the-art algorithm.",

It is difficult to collect large\nquantities of such data for ASR system development due to the mobility issues\noften found among these users. To this end, data augmentation techniques play a\nvital role. In contrast to existing data augmentation techniques only modifying\nthe speaking rate or overall shape of spectral contour, fine-grained\nspectro-temporal differences between dysarthric, elderly and normal speech are\nmodelled using a novel set of speaker dependent (SD) generative adversarial\nnetworks (GAN) based data augmentation approaches in this paper.

    "abstract": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is an important tool in\ncharacterizing tissue microstructure based on biophysical models, which are\ncomplex and highly non-linear. Resolving microstructures with optimization\ntechniques is prone to estimation errors and requires dense sampling in the\nq-space. Deep learning based approaches have been proposed to overcome these\nlimitations. Motivated by the superior performance of the Transformer, in this\nwork, we present a learning-based framework based on Transformer, namely, a\nMicrostructure Estimation Transformer with Sparse Coding (METSC) for dMRI-based\nmicrostructure estimation with downsampled q-space data. To take advantage of\nthe Transformer while addressing its limitation in large training data\nrequirements, we explicitly introduce an inductive bias - model bias into the\nTransformer using a sparse coding technique to facilitate the training process.\nThus, the METSC is composed with three stages, an embedding stage, a sparse\nrepresentation stage, and a mapping stage. The embedding stage is a\nTransformer-based structure that encodes the signal to ensure the voxel is\nrepresented effectively. In the sparse representation stage, a dictionary is\nconstructed by solving a sparse reconstruction problem that unfolds the\nIterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) process. The mapping stage is essentially a\ndecoder that computes the microstructural parameters from the output of the\nsecond stage, based on the weighted sum of normalized dictionary coefficients\nwhere the weights are also learned. We tested our framework on two dMRI models\nwith downsampled q-space data, including the intravoxel incoherent motion\n(IVIM) model and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI)\nmodel. The proposed method achieved up to 11.25 folds of acceleration in scan\ntime and outperformed the other state-of-the-art learning-based methods.",

Particularly notable\namong these are the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), which unified many of the\nearlier ideas around atom density-based descriptors, and Neural Equivariant\nInteratomic Potentials (NequIP), a message passing neural network with\nequivariant features that showed state of the art accuracy. In this work, we\nconstruct a mathematical framework that unifies these models: ACE is\ngeneralised so that it can be recast as one layer of a multi-layer\narchitecture. From another point of view, the linearised version of NequIP is\nunderstood as a particular sparsification of a much larger polynomial model.\nOur framework also provides a practical tool for systematically probing\ndifferent choices in the unified design space. We demonstrate this by an\nablation study of NequIP via a set of experiments looking at in- and\nout-of-domain accuracy and smooth extrapolation very far from the training\ndata, and shed some light on which design choices are critical for achieving\nhigh accuracy. Finally, we present BOTNet (Body-Ordered-Tensor-Network), a\nmuch-simplified version of NequIP, which has an interpretable architecture and\nmaintains accuracy on benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Designing robust and accurate prediction models has been a viable research\narea since a long time. While proponents of a well-functioning market\npredictors believe that it is difficult to accurately predict market prices but\nmany scholars disagree. Robust and accurate prediction systems will not only be\nhelpful to the businesses but also to the individuals in making their financial\ninvestments. This paper presents an LSTM model with two different input\napproaches for predicting the short-term stock prices of two Indian companies,\nReliance Industries and Infosys Ltd. Ten years of historic data (2012-2021) is\ntaken from the yahoo finance website to carry out analysis of proposed\napproaches. In the first approach, closing prices of two selected companies are\ndirectly applied on univariate LSTM model. For the approach second, technical\nindicators values are calculated from the closing prices and then collectively\napplied on Multivariate LSTM model. Short term market behaviour for upcoming\ndays is evaluated. Experimental outcomes revel that approach one is useful to\ndetermine the future trend but multivariate LSTM model with technical\nindicators found to be useful in accurately predicting the future price\nbehaviours.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) is one of the most common medical imaging modalities since it\nis radiation-free, low-cost, and real-time. In freehand US examinations,\nsonographers often navigate a US probe to visualize standard examination planes\nwith rich diagnostic information. However, reproducibility and stability of the\nresulting images often suffer from intra- and inter-operator variation.\nReinforcement learning (RL), as an interaction-based learning method, has\ndemonstrated its effectiveness in visual navigating tasks; however, RL is\nlimited in terms of generalization. To address this challenge, we propose a\nsimulation-based RL framework for real-world navigation of US probes towards\nthe standard longitudinal views of vessels. A UNet is used to provide binary\nmasks from US images; thereby, the RL agent trained on simulated binary vessel\nimages can be applied in real scenarios without further training. To accurately\ncharacterize actual states, a multi-modality state representation structure is\nintroduced to facilitate the understanding of environments. Moreover,\nconsidering the characteristics of vessels, a novel standard view recognition\napproach based on the minimum bounding rectangle is proposed to terminate the\nsearching process. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the\ntrained policy is validated virtually on 3D volumes of a volunteer's in-vivo\ncarotid artery, and physically on custom-designed gel phantoms using robotic\nUS. The results demonstrate that proposed approach can effectively and\naccurately navigate the probe towards the longitudinal view of vessels.",

    "title": "Heavy-Tail Phenomenon in Decentralized SGD",
    "abstract": "Recent theoretical studies have shown that heavy-tails can emerge in\nstochastic optimization due to `multiplicative noise', even under surprisingly\nsimple settings, such as linear regression with Gaussian data. While these\nstudies have uncovered several interesting phenomena, they consider\nconventional stochastic optimization problems, which exclude decentralized\nsettings that naturally arise in modern machine learning applications. In this\npaper, we study the emergence of heavy-tails in decentralized stochastic\ngradient descent (DE-SGD), and investigate the effect of decentralization on\nthe tail behavior. We first show that, when the loss function at each\ncomputational node is twice continuously differentiable and strongly convex\noutside a compact region, the law of the DE-SGD iterates converges to a\ndistribution with polynomially decaying (heavy) tails. To have a more explicit\ncontrol on the tail exponent, we then consider the case where the loss at each\nnode is a quadratic, and show that the tail-index can be estimated as a\nfunction of the step-size, batch-size, and the topological properties of the\nnetwork of the computational nodes. Then, we provide theoretical and empirical\nresults showing that DE-SGD has heavier tails than centralized SGD. We also\ncompare DE-SGD to disconnected SGD where nodes distribute the data but do not\ncommunicate. Our theory uncovers an interesting interplay between the tails and\nthe network structure: we identify two regimes of parameters (stepsize and\nnetwork size), where DE-SGD %addition of network structure can have lighter or\nheavier tails than disconnected SGD depending on the regime. Finally, to\nsupport our theoretical results, we provide numerical experiments conducted on\nboth synthetic data and neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Observational studies are regarded as economic alternatives to randomized\ntrials, often used in their stead to investigate and determine treatment\nefficacy. Due to lack of sample size, observational studies commonly combine\ndata from multiple sources or different sites/centers. Despite the benefits of\nan increased sample size, a naive combination of multicenter data may result in\nincongruities stemming from center-specific protocols for generating cohorts or\nreactions towards treatments distinct to a given center, among other things.\nThese issues arise in a variety of other contexts, including capturing a\ntreatment effect related to an individual's unique biological characteristics.\nExisting methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects have not\nadequately addressed the multicenter context, but rather treat it simply as a\nmeans to obtain sufficient sample size. Additionally, previous approaches to\nestimating treatment effects do not straightforwardly generalize to the\nmulticenter design, especially when required to provide treatment insights for\npatients from a new, unobserved center. To address these shortcomings, we\npropose Multiple Domain Causal Networks (MDCN), an approach that simultaneously\nstrengthens the information sharing between similar centers while addressing\nthe selection bias in treatment assignment through learning of a new feature\nembedding. In empirical evaluations, MDCN is consistently more accurate when\nestimating the heterogeneous treatment effect in new centers compared to\nbenchmarks that adjust solely based on treatment imbalance or general center\ndifferences. Finally, we justify our approach by providing theoretical analyses\nthat demonstrate that MDCN improves on the generalization bound of the new,\nunobserved target center.",
