    "title": "ST-ExpertNet: A Deep Expert Framework for Traffic Prediction",
    "abstract": "Recently, forecasting the crowd flows has become an important research topic,\nand plentiful technologies have achieved good performances. As we all know, the\nflow at a citywide level is in a mixed state with several basic patterns (e.g.,\ncommuting, working, and commercial) caused by the city area functional\ndistributions (e.g., developed commercial areas, educational areas and parks).\nHowever, existing technologies have been criticized for their lack of\nconsidering the differences in the flow patterns among regions since they want\nto build only one comprehensive model to learn the mixed flow tensors.\nRecognizing this limitation, we present a new perspective on flow prediction\nand propose an explainable framework named ST-ExpertNet, which can adopt every\nspatial-temporal model and train a set of functional experts devoted to\nspecific flow patterns. Technically, we train a bunch of experts based on the\nMixture of Experts (MoE), which guides each expert to specialize in different\nkinds of flow patterns in sample spaces by using the gating network. We define\nseveral criteria, including comprehensiveness, sparsity, and preciseness, to\nconstruct the experts for better interpretability and performances. We conduct\nexperiments on a wide range of real-world taxi and bike datasets in Beijing and\nNYC. The visualizations of the expert's intermediate results demonstrate that\nour ST-ExpertNet successfully disentangles the city's mixed flow tensors along\nwith the city layout, e.g., the urban ring road structure. Different network\narchitectures, such as ST-ResNet, ConvLSTM, and CNN, have been adopted into our\nST-ExpertNet framework for experiments and the results demonstrates the\nsuperiority of our framework in both interpretability and performances.",

    "abstract": "Numerical simulation is an essential tool in many areas of science and\nengineering, but its performance often limits application in practice or when\nused to explore large parameter spaces. On the other hand, surrogate deep\nlearning models, while accelerating simulations, often exhibit poor accuracy\nand ability to generalise. In order to improve these two factors, we introduce\nREMuS-GNN, a rotation-equivariant multi-scale model for simulating continuum\ndynamical systems encompassing a range of length scales. REMuS-GNN is designed\nto predict an output vector field from an input vector field on a physical\ndomain discretised into an unstructured set of nodes. Equivariance to rotations\nof the domain is a desirable inductive bias that allows the network to learn\nthe underlying physics more efficiently, leading to improved accuracy and\ngeneralisation compared with similar architectures that lack such symmetry. We\ndemonstrate and evaluate this method on the incompressible flow around\nelliptical cylinders.",

    "abstract": "Learning predictive models in new domains with scarce training data is a\ngrowing challenge in modern supervised learning scenarios. This incentivizes\ndeveloping domain adaptation methods that leverage the knowledge in known\ndomains (source) and adapt to new domains (target) with a different probability\ndistribution. This becomes more challenging when the source and target domains\nare in heterogeneous feature spaces, known as heterogeneous domain adaptation\n(HDA). While most HDA methods utilize mathematical optimization to map source\nand target data to a common space, they suffer from low transferability. Neural\nrepresentations have proven to be more transferable; however, they are mainly\ndesigned for homogeneous environments. Drawing on the theory of domain\nadaptation, we propose a novel framework, Heterogeneous Adversarial Neural\nDomain Adaptation (HANDA), to effectively maximize the transferability in\nheterogeneous environments. HANDA conducts feature and distribution alignment\nin a unified neural network architecture and achieves domain invariance through\nadversarial kernel learning. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the\nperformance against the state-of-the-art HDA methods on major image and text\ne-commerce benchmarks. HANDA shows statistically significant improvement in\npredictive performance. The practical utility of HANDA was shown in real-world\ndark web online markets. HANDA is an important step towards successful domain\nadaptation in e-commerce applications.",

    "abstract": "MRI-based modeling of brain networks has been widely used to understand\nfunctional and structural interactions and connections among brain regions, and\nfactors that affect them, such as brain development and disease. Graph mining\non brain networks may facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers for clinical\nphenotypes and neurodegenerative diseases. Since brain networks derived from\nfunctional and structural MRI describe the brain topology from different\nperspectives, exploring a representation that combines these cross-modality\nbrain networks is non-trivial. Most current studies aim to extract a fused\nrepresentation of the two types of brain network by projecting the structural\nnetwork to the functional counterpart. Since the functional network is dynamic\nand the structural network is static, mapping a static object to a dynamic\nobject is suboptimal. However, mapping in the opposite direction is not\nfeasible due to the non-negativity requirement of current graph learning\ntechniques. Here, we propose a novel graph learning framework, known as Deep\nSigned Brain Networks (DSBN), with a signed graph encoder that, from an\nopposite perspective, learns the cross-modality representations by projecting\nthe functional network to the structural counterpart. We validate our framework\non clinical phenotype and neurodegenerative disease prediction tasks using two\nindependent, publicly available datasets (HCP and OASIS).

    "abstract": "The interest in analog computation has grown tremendously in recent years due\nto its fast computation speed and excellent energy efficiency, which is very\nimportant for edge and IoT devices in the sub-watt power envelope for deep\nlearning inferencing. However, significant performance degradation suffered by\ndeep learning models due to the inherent noise present in the analog\ncomputation can limit their use in mission-critical applications. Hence, there\nis a need to understand the impact of critical model hyperparameters choice on\nthe resulting model noise-resistant property. This need is critical as the\ninsight obtained can be used to design deep learning models that are robust to\nanalog noise. In this paper, the impact of the learning rate, a critical design\nchoice, on the noise-resistant property is investigated. The study is achieved\nby first training deep learning models using different learning rates.\nThereafter, the models are injected with analog noise and the noise-resistant\nproperty of the resulting models is examined by measuring the performance\ndegradation due to the analog noise. The results showed there exists a sweet\nspot of learning rate values that achieves a good balance between model\nprediction performance and model noise-resistant property.

Despite the promising performance of existing methods, most\nof their success comes from the privileged information of well-designed\ninput-output examples. However, providing such input-output examples is\nunrealistic because it requires the users to have the ability to describe the\nunderlying program with a few input-output examples under the training\ndistribution. In this work, we propose a query-based framework that trains a\nquery neural network to generate informative input-output examples\nautomatically and interactively from a large query space. The quality of the\nquery depends on the amount of the mutual information between the query and the\ncorresponding program, which can guide the optimization of the query framework.\nTo estimate the mutual information more accurately, we introduce the functional\nspace (F-space) which models the relevance between the input-output examples\nand the programs in a differentiable way. We evaluate the effectiveness and\ngeneralization of the proposed query-based framework on the Karel task and the\nlist processing task. Experimental results show that the query-based framework\ncan generate informative input-output examples which achieve and even\noutperform well-designed input-output examples.",

We prove that the MLR loss is\nan accurate in-sample estimator for out-of-sample generalization performance\nand that it can be used to perform Hyper-Parameter Optimization provided a\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio condition is met. The Tikhonov operator training scheme\nmodulates the capacity of a FFNN in an adaptive, differentiable and\ndata-dependent manner.

As to the architecture, our network includes two main parts, i.e.,\npre-processing and network backbone.

For data\naugmentation, instead of introducing complex operations over graphs, we\nconstruct two augmented views of the same vertex by designing parameter\nun-shared siamese encoders and corrupting the node embeddings directly.\nFinally, as to the objective function, to further improve the clustering\nperformance, a novel cross-view structural consistency objective function is\ndesigned to enhance the discriminative capability of the learned network.\nExtensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets validate our\nproposed algorithm's effectiveness and superiority.

In particular, a sequential-scanning mechanism is designed as action\nstrategy of agents, and a collaborative-changing environment is used to enhance\nagent collaboration. In addition, an interactive paradigm introduces prior\nselection knowledge to help agents for more efficient exploration. Finally,\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets have demonstrated improved\nperformances.",

    "abstract": "Organisms in nature have evolved to exhibit flexibility in face of changes to\nthe environment and/or to themselves. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have\nproven useful for controlling of artificial agents acting in environments.\nHowever, most ANN models used for reinforcement learning-type tasks have a\nrigid structure that does not allow for varying input sizes. Further, they fail\ncatastrophically if inputs are presented in an ordering unseen during\noptimization. We find that these two ANN inflexibilities can be mitigated and\ntheir solutions are simple and highly related. For permutation invariance, no\noptimized parameters can be tied to a specific index of the input elements. For\nsize invariance, inputs must be projected onto a common space that does not\ngrow with the number of projections. Based on these restrictions, we construct\na conceptually simple model that exhibit flexibility most ANNs lack. We\ndemonstrate the model's properties on multiple control problems, and show that\nit can cope with even very rapid permutations of input indices, as well as\nchanges in input size. Ablation studies show that is possible to achieve these\nproperties with simple feedforward structures, but that it is much easier to\noptimize recurrent structures.",

    "abstract": "As robots are increasingly deployed in real-world scenarios, a key question\nis how to best transfer knowledge learned in one environment to another, where\nshifting constraints and human preferences render adaptation challenging. A\ncentral challenge remains that often, it is difficult (perhaps even impossible)\nto capture the full complexity of the deployment environment, and therefore the\ndesired tasks, at training time. Consequently, the representation, or\nabstraction, of the tasks the human hopes for the robot to perform in one\nenvironment may be misaligned with the representation of the tasks that the\nrobot has learned in another. We postulate that because humans will be the\nultimate evaluator of system success in the world, they are best suited to\ncommunicating the aspects of the tasks that matter to the robot. Our key\ninsight is that effective learning from human input requires first explicitly\nlearning good intermediate representations and then using those representations\nfor solving downstream tasks. We highlight three areas where we can use this\napproach to build interactive systems and offer future directions of work to\nbetter create advanced collaborative robots.",

Normative constraints on argument-making are as old as philosophy\nitself, but little is known about the diversity of arguments made in practice.\nWe use NLP tools to extract patterns of argument-making from the Reddit site\n\"Change My View\" (r/CMV). This reveals six distinct argument patterns: not just\nthe familiar deductive and inductive forms, but also arguments about\ndefinitions, relevance, possibility and cause, and personal experience. Data\nfrom r/CMV also reveal differences in efficacy: personal experience and, to a\nlesser extent, arguments about causation and examples, are most likely to shift\na person's view, while arguments about relevance are the least. Finally, our\nmethods reveal a gradient of argument-making preferences among users: a\ntwo-axis model, of \"personal--impersonal\" and \"concrete--abstract\", can account\nfor nearly 80% of the strategy variance between individuals.",

    "abstract": "Federated edge learning (FEL) can training a global model from terminal\nnodes' local dataset, which can make full use of the computing resources of\nterminal nodes and performs more extensive and efficient machine learning on\nterminal nodes with protecting user information requirements. Performance of\nFEL will be suffered from long delay or fault decision as the master collects\npartial gradients from stragglers which cannot return correct results within a\ndeadline. Inspired by this, in this paper, we propose a novel coded FEL to\nmitigate stragglers for synchronous gradient with a two-stage dynamic scheme,\nwhere we start with part of workers for a duration of before starting the\nsecond stage, and on completion of at the first stage, we start remaining\nworkers in the second stage. In particular, the computation latency and\ntransmission latency is essential and should be quantitatively analyzed. Then\nthe dynamically coded coefficients scheme is proposed which is based on\nhistorical information including worker completion time. For performance\noptimization of FEL, a Lyapunov function is designed to maximize admission data\nbalancing fairness and two stage dynamic coding scheme is designed to maximize\narrival data among workers. Experimental evidence verifies the derived\nproperties and demonstrates that our proposed solution achieves a better\nperformance for practical network parameters and benchmark datasets in terms of\naccuracy and resource utilization in the FEL system.",

As predicting the binding energies is statistically\ndefined as a regression problem, in addition to using data augmentation for\nnuclear physics, this study contributes to this field for regression in\ngeneral.

    "abstract": "The need for flexibility and curtailable resources is crucial for ensuring\nthe healthy operation of future distribution networks (DN). In this work, we\npropose a network-state driven framework that distribution system operators\n(DSOs) can utilize for activating flexible and curtailable resources for\nalleviating network voltage and thermal issues, while accounting for network\nvoltage and current imbalances. This approach assumes the availability of\ndynamic network state information and uses nodal sensitivities for calculating\na flexibility activation signal (FAS). The signal design is motivated by\nvolt-Var and volt-watt inverter control, and thus bounded. The FAS also\nconsiders network voltage and current imbalances and incentivizes activation of\nactive and reactive power flexibilities for reducing imbalance in addition to\nmitigating voltage and thermal imbalances in a three-phase unbalanced\ndistribution network. The FAS design resembles optimal power flow duals, often\nused as locational marginal prices. The gains associated with the imbalance\ncomponent of the objective function of three-phase unbalanced resource\nactivation (TPU-RA) is performed using Pareto optimality. A numerical case\nstudy is presented showing the efficacy of the proposed framework in avoiding\nnetwork issues while reducing voltage unbalance factor by more than 80\\%.\nFurther, DN's flexibility needs are quantified for location and time of day.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has fueled the spread of misinformation on social media\nand the Web as a whole. The phenomenon dubbed `infodemic' has taken the\nchallenges of information veracity and trust to new heights by massively\nintroducing seemingly scientific and technical elements into misleading\ncontent. Despite the existing body of work on modeling and predicting\nmisinformation, the coverage of very complex scientific topics with inherent\nuncertainty and an evolving set of findings, such as COVID-19, provides many\nnew challenges that are not easily solved by existing tools. To address these\nissues, we introduce SciLander, a method for learning representations of news\nsources reporting on science-based topics. SciLander extracts four\nheterogeneous indicators for the news sources; two generic indicators that\ncapture (1) the copying of news stories between sources, and (2) the use of the\nsame terms to mean different things (i.e., the semantic shift of terms), and\ntwo scientific indicators that capture (1) the usage of jargon and (2) the\nstance towards specific citations. We use these indicators as signals of source\nagreement, sampling pairs of positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar)\nsamples, and combine them in a unified framework to train unsupervised news\nsource embeddings with a triplet margin loss objective. We evaluate our method\non a novel COVID-19 dataset containing nearly 1M news articles from 500 sources\nspanning a period of 18 months since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. Our\nresults show that the features learned by our model outperform state-of-the-art\nbaseline methods on the task of news veracity classification. Furthermore, a\nclustering analysis suggests that the learned representations encode\ninformation about the reliability, political leaning, and partisanship bias of\nthese sources.",

    "abstract": "We present TOCH, a method for refining incorrect 3D hand-object interaction\nsequences using a data prior. Existing hand trackers, especially those that\nrely on very few cameras, often produce visually unrealistic results with\nhand-object intersection or missing contacts. Although correcting such errors\nrequires reasoning about temporal aspects of interaction, most previous work\nfocus on static grasps and contacts. The core of our method are TOCH fields, a\nnovel spatio-temporal representation for modeling correspondences between hands\nand objects during interaction. The key component is a point-wise\nobject-centric representation which encodes the hand position relative to the\nobject. Leveraging this novel representation, we learn a latent manifold of\nplausible TOCH fields with a temporal denoising auto-encoder. Experiments\ndemonstrate that TOCH outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D hand-object\ninteraction models, which are limited to static grasps and contacts. More\nimportantly, our method produces smooth interactions even before and after\ncontact. Using a single trained TOCH model, we quantitatively and qualitatively\ndemonstrate its usefulness for 1) correcting erroneous reconstruction results\nfrom off-the-shelf RGB/RGB-D hand-object reconstruction methods, 2) de-noising,\nand 3) grasp transfer across objects.

    "abstract": "The emergence of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) brings new opportunities to\nboost the performance of sorting acceleration on FPGAs, which was\nconventionally bounded by the available off-chip memory bandwidth. However, it\nis nontrivial for designers to fully utilize this immense bandwidth. First, the\nexisting sorter designs cannot be directly scaled at the increasing rate of\navailable off-chip bandwidth, as the required on-chip resource usage grows at a\nmuch faster rate and would bound the sorting performance in turn. Second,\ndesigners need an in-depth understanding of HBM characteristics to effectively\nutilize the HBM bandwidth. To tackle these challenges, we present TopSort, a\nnovel two-phase sorting solution optimized for HBM-based FPGAs. In the first\nphase, 16 merge trees work in parallel to fully utilize 32 HBM channels. In the\nsecond phase, TopSort reuses the logic from phase one to form a wider merge\ntree to merge the partially sorted results from phase one. TopSort also adopts\nHBM-specific optimizations to reduce resource overhead and improve bandwidth\nutilization. TopSort can sort up to 4 GB data using all 32 HBM channels, with\nan overall sorting performance of 15.6 GB/s. TopSort is 6.7x and 2.2x faster\nthan state-of-the-art CPU and FPGA sorters.",

    "abstract": "The ability to plan for multi-step manipulation tasks in unseen situations is\ncrucial for future home robots. But collecting sufficient experience data for\nend-to-end learning is often infeasible in the real world, as deploying robots\nin many environments can be prohibitively expensive.

Previous research has shown that these translation artifacts\ninfluence the performance of a variety of cross-lingual tasks. In this work, we\npropose a novel approach to reducing translationese by extending an established\nbias-removal technique. We use the Iterative Null-space Projection (INLP)\nalgorithm, and show by measuring classification accuracy before and after\ndebiasing, that translationese is reduced at both sentence and word level. We\nevaluate the utility of debiasing translationese on a natural language\ninference (NLI) task, and show that by reducing this bias, NLI accuracy\nimproves.

In this\nwork, we apply the lossy JPEG compression method with six discrete levels of\nincreasing compression {95, 75, 50, 15, 10, 5} to infrared band (thermal)\nimagery. Our study quantitatively evaluates the affect that increasing levels\nof lossy compression has upon the performance of characteristically diverse\nobject detection architectures (Cascade-RCNN, FSAF and Deformable DETR) with\nrespect to varying sizes of objects present in the dataset. When training and\nevaluating on uncompressed data as a baseline, we achieve maximal mean Average\nPrecision (mAP) of 0.823 with Cascade R-CNN across the FLIR dataset,\noutperforming prior work. The impact of the lossy compression is more extreme\nat higher compression levels (15, 10, 5) across all three CNN architectures.\nHowever, re-training models on lossy compressed imagery notably ameliorated\nperformances for all three CNN models with an average increment of ~76% (at\nhigher compression level 5). Additionally, we demonstrate the relative\nsensitivity of differing object areas {tiny, small, medium, large} with respect\nto the compression level.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) link prediction is a fundamental task in artificial\nintelligence, with applications in natural language processing, information\nretrieval, and biomedicine. Recently, promising results have been achieved by\nleveraging cross-modal information in KGs, using ensembles that combine\nknowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and contextual language models (LMs).\nHowever, existing ensembles are either (1) not consistently effective in terms\nof ranking accuracy gains or (2) impractically inefficient on larger datasets\ndue to the combinatorial explosion problem of pairwise ranking with deep\nlanguage models. In this paper, we propose a novel tiered ranking architecture\nCascadER to maintain the ranking accuracy of full ensembling while improving\nefficiency considerably. CascadER uses LMs to rerank the outputs of more\nefficient base KGEs, relying on an adaptive subset selection scheme aimed at\ninvoking the LMs minimally while maximizing accuracy gain over the KGE.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that CascadER improves MRR by up to 9 points\nover KGE baselines, setting new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks\nwhile improving efficiency by one or more orders of magnitude over competitive\ncross-modal baselines. Our empirical analyses reveal that diversity of models\nacross modalities and preservation of individual models' confidence signals\nhelp explain the effectiveness of CascadER, and suggest promising directions\nfor cross-modal cascaded architectures.

Point clouds\nare important datatype for precise modeling of three-dimensional environments,\nbut effective processing of this type of data proves to be challenging. In the\nworld of large, heavily-parameterized network architectures and\ncontinuously-streamed data, there is an increasing need for machine learning\nmodels that can be trained on additional data. Unfortunately, currently\navailable models cannot fully leverage training on additional data without\nlosing their past knowledge. Combating this phenomenon, called catastrophic\nforgetting, is one of the main objectives of continual learning. Continual\nlearning for deep neural networks has been an active field of research,\nprimarily in 2D computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement\nlearning, and robotics. However, in 3D computer vision, there are hardly any\ncontinual learning solutions specifically designed to take advantage of point\ncloud structure. This work proposes a novel neural network architecture capable\nof continual learning on 3D point cloud data. We utilize point cloud structure\nproperties for preserving a heavily compressed set of past data. By using\nrehearsal and reconstruction as regularization methods of the learning process,\nour approach achieves a significant decrease of catastrophic forgetting\ncompared to the existing solutions on several most popular point cloud datasets\nconsidering two continual learning settings: when a task is known beforehand,\nand in the challenging scenario of when task information is unknown to the\nmodel.",

The techniques we\ndeveloped are based on Siegel's Lemma for the bounds, anti-concentration\ninequalities for the existential results and extensions of Sylvester-type\nHadamard matrices for the constructions.\nWe explicitly construct a constant weight, optimal size matrix to compute the\nEQUALITY function (checking if two integers expressed in binary are equal).\nComputing EQUALITY with a single linear equation requires exponentially large\nweights. In addition, we prove the existence of the best-known weight size\n(linear) matrices to compute the COMPARISON function (comparing between two\nintegers expressed in binary). In the context of the circuit complexity theory,\nour results improve the upper bounds on the weight sizes for the best-known\ncircuit sizes for EQUALITY and COMPARISON.",

    "abstract": "We address the problem of using observational data to estimate peer contagion\neffects, the influence of treatments applied to individuals in a network on the\noutcomes of their neighbors. A main challenge to such estimation is that\nhomophily - the tendency of connected units to share similar latent traits -\nacts as an unobserved confounder for contagion effects. Informally, it's hard\nto tell whether your friends have similar outcomes because they were influenced\nby your treatment, or whether it's due to some common trait that caused you to\nbe friends in the first place. Because these common causes are not usually\ndirectly observed, they cannot be simply adjusted for. We describe an approach\nto perform the required adjustment using node embeddings learned from the\nnetwork itself. The main aim is to perform this adjustment nonparametrically,\nwithout functional form assumptions on either the process that generated the\nnetwork or the treatment assignment and outcome processes. The key\ncontributions are to nonparametrically formalize the causal effect in a way\nthat accounts for homophily, and to show how embedding methods can be used to\nidentify and estimate this effect.

Accurate detection of cyber attacks is crucial, however precise\nidentification of the type of attacks plays a huge role if devising the\ncountermeasure for protecting the system. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have\nprovided promising results for detecting any security attacks for smart\napplications. However, due to complex nature of the model used for this\ntechnique it is not easy for normal users to trust ANN based security\nsolutions. Also, selection of right hyperparameters for ANN architecture plays\na crucial role in the accurate detection of security attacks, especially when\nit come to identifying the subcategories of attacks. In this paper, we propose\na model that considers both the issues of explainability of ANN model and the\nhyperparameter selection for this approach to be easily trusted and adapted by\nusers of smart home applications. Also, our approach considers a subset of the\ndataset for optimal selection of hyperparamters to reduce the overhead of the\nprocess of ANN architecture design. Distinctively this paper focuses on\nconfiguration, performance and evaluation of ANN architecture for\nidentification of five categorical attacks and nine subcategorical attacks.\nUsing a very recent IoT dataset our approach showed high performance for\nintrusion detection with 99.9%, 99.7%, and 97.7% accuracy for Binary, Category,\nand Subcategory level classification of attacks.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a timing attack on the FIDO2 (Fast IDentity Online)\nauthentication protocol that allows attackers to link user accounts stored in\nvulnerable authenticators, a serious privacy concern. FIDO2 is a new standard\nspecified by the FIDO industry alliance for secure token online authentication.\nIt complements the W3C WebAuthn specification by providing means to use a USB\ntoken or other authenticator as a second factor during the authentication\nprocess. From a cryptographic perspective, the protocol is a simple\nchallenge-response where the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm is used\nto sign challenges. To protect the privacy of the user the token uses unique\nkey pairs per service. To accommodate for small memory, tokens use various\ntechniques that make use of a special parameter called a key handle sent by the\nservice to the token. We identify and analyse a vulnerability in the way the\nprocessing of key handles is implemented that allows attackers to remotely link\nuser accounts on multiple services. We show that for vulnerable authenticators\nthere is a difference between the time it takes to process a key handle for a\ndifferent service but correct authenticator, and for a different authenticator\nbut correct service. This difference can be used to perform a timing attack\nallowing an adversary to link user's accounts across services. We present\nseveral real world examples of adversaries that are in a position to execute\nour attack and can benefit from linking accounts. We found that two of the\neight hardware authenticators we tested were vulnerable despite FIDO level 1\ncertification. This vulnerability cannot be easily mitigated on authenticators\nbecause, for security reasons, they usually do not allow firmware updates. In\naddition, we show that due to the way existing browsers implement the WebAuthn\nstandard, the attack can be executed remotely.",

The mainstream\napproach so far is to develop individual algorithms for each domain and each\ntask. In this paper, we explore the possibility of developing a unified\nfoundation model to support \\emph{open-ended domains and tasks} in an\nindustrial recommender system, which may reduce the demand on downstream\nsettings' data and can minimize the carbon footprint by avoiding training a\nseparate model from scratch for every task. Deriving a unified foundation is\nchallenging due to (i) the potentially unlimited set of downstream domains and\ntasks, and (ii) the real-world systems' emphasis on computational efficiency.\nWe thus build our foundation upon M6, an existing large-scale industrial\npretrained language model similar to GPT-3 and T5, and leverage M6's pretrained\nability for sample-efficient downstream adaptation, by representing user\nbehavior data as plain texts and converting the tasks to either language\nunderstanding or generation.

    "abstract": "We study the effects of injecting human-generated designs into the initial\npopulation of an evolutionary robotics experiment, where subsequent population\nof robots are optimised via a Genetic Algorithm and MAP-Elites. First, human\nparticipants interact via a graphical front-end to explore a\ndirectly-parameterised legged robot design space and attempt to produce robots\nvia a combination of intuition and trial-and-error that perform well in a range\nof environments. Environments are generated whose corresponding\nhigh-performance robot designs range from intuitive to complex and hard to\ngrasp. Once the human designs have been collected, their impact on the\nevolutionary process is assessed by replacing a varying number of designs in\nthe initial population with human designs and subsequently running the\nevolutionary algorithm. Our results suggest that a balance of random and\nhand-designed initial solutions provides the best performance for the problems\nconsidered, and that human designs are most valuable when the problem is\nintuitive. The influence of human design in an evolutionary algorithm is a\nhighly understudied area, and the insights in this paper may be valuable to the\narea of AI-based design more generally.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technique that guarantees the traceability\nof transactions. Blockchain is adopted in multiple domains like finance (e.g.,\ncryptocurrency), healthcare, security, and supply chain. In the open-source\nsoftware (OSS) portal GitHub, we observe a growing adoption of Blockchain-based\nsolutions. Given the rapid emergence of Blockchain-based solutions in our daily\nlife and the evolving cryptocurrency market, it is important to know the status\nquo, how developers generally interact in those repos, and how much freedom\nthey have in applying code changes. We report an empirical study of 3,664\nBlockchain software repositories from GitHub. We divide the Blockchain\nrepositories into two categories: Tool (e.g., SDKs) and Applications (e.g.,\nservice/solutions developed using SDKs). The Application category is further\ndivided into two sub-categories: Crypto and Non-Crypto applications. In all\nBlockchain repository categories, the contribution interactions on commits are\nthe most common interaction type. We found that more organizations contributing\nto the Blockchain repos than individual users. The median numbers of internal\nand external users in tools are higher than the application repos. We observed\na higher degree of collaboration (e.g., for maintenance efforts) among users in\nBlockchain tools than those in the application repos. Among the artifacts,\nissues have a greater number of interactions than commits and pull requests.\nRelated to autonomy we found that less than half of total project contributions\nare autonomous. Our findings offer implications to Blockchain stakeholders,\nlike developers to stay aware of OSS practices around Blockchain software.",

These\napproaches require sending messages of unlimited size, so they do not extend to\nthe CONGEST model, which restricts the message size to be $O(\\log n)$ bits.\nIn this paper, we develop a generic framework for obtaining $\\text{poly}(\\log\nn, 1/\\epsilon)$-round $(1\\pm \\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms for many\ncombinatorial optimization problems, including maximum weighted matching,\nmaximum independent set, and correlation clustering, in graphs excluding a\nfixed minor in the CONGEST model. This class of graphs covers many sparse\nnetwork classes that have been studied in the literature, including planar\ngraphs, bounded-genus graphs, and bounded-treewidth graphs.\nFurthermore, we show that our framework can be applied to give an efficient\ndistributed property testing algorithm for an arbitrary minor-closed graph\nproperty that is closed under taking disjoint union, significantly generalizing\nthe previous distributed property testing algorithm for planarity in [Levi,\nMedina, and Ron, PODC 2018 & Distributed Computing 2021].\nOur framework uses distributed expander decomposition algorithms [Chang and\nSaranurak, FOCS 2020] to decompose the graph into clusters of high conductance.\nWe show that any graph excluding a fixed minor admits small edge separators.\nUsing this result, we show the existence of a high-degree vertex in each\ncluster in an expander decomposition, which allows the entire graph topology of\nthe cluster to be routed to a vertex. Similar to the use of network\ndecompositions in the LOCAL model, the vertex will be able to perform any local\ncomputation on the subgraph induced by the cluster and broadcast the result\nover the cluster.",

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning has become an important field of research due to an\nincreasing focus on addressing the evolving data privacy rules and regulations\ninto the machine learning (ML) applications. It facilitates the request for\nremoval of certain set or class of data from the already trained ML model\nwithout retraining from scratch. Recently, several efforts have been made to\nperform unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. We propose a novel\nmachine unlearning method by exploring the utility of competent and incompetent\nteachers in a student-teacher framework to induce forgetfulness. The knowledge\nfrom the competent and incompetent teachers is selectively transferred to the\nstudent to obtain a model that doesn't contain any information about the forget\ndata. We experimentally show that this method is well generalized, fast, and\neffective. Furthermore, we introduce a zero retrain forgetting (ZRF) metric to\nevaluate the unlearning method. Unlike the existing unlearning metrics, the ZRF\nscore does not depend on the availability of the expensive retrained model.\nThis makes it useful for analysis of the unlearned model after deployment as\nwell. The experiments are conducted for random subset forgetting and class\nforgetting on various deep networks and across different application domains.

    "abstract": "Many organizations have access to abundant data but lack the computational\npower to process the data. While they can outsource the computational task to\nother facilities, there are various constraints on the amount of data that can\nbe shared. It is natural to ask what can data outsourcing accomplish under such\nconstraints. We address this question from a machine learning perspective. When\ntraining a model with optimization algorithms, the quality of the results often\nrelies heavily on the points where the algorithms are initialized. Random start\nis one of the most popular methods to tackle this issue, but it can be\ncomputationally expensive and not feasible for organizations lacking computing\nresources. Based on three different scenarios, we propose simulation-based\nalgorithms that can utilize a small amount of outsourced data to find good\ninitial points accordingly. Under suitable regularity conditions, we provide\ntheoretical guarantees showing the algorithms can find good initial points with\nhigh probability. We also conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate that our\nalgorithms perform significantly better than the random start approach.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art deep learning models have a parameter count that reaches\ninto the billions. Training, storing and transferring such models is energy and\ntime consuming, thus costly. A big part of these costs is caused by training\nthe network. Model compression lowers storage and transfer costs, and can\nfurther make training more efficient by decreasing the number of computations\nin the forward and/or backward pass. Thus, compressing networks also at\ntraining time while maintaining a high performance is an important research\ntopic. This work is a survey on methods which reduce the number of trained\nweights in deep learning models throughout the training. Most of the introduced\nmethods set network parameters to zero which is called pruning. The presented\npruning approaches are categorized into pruning at initialization, lottery\ntickets and dynamic sparse training. Moreover, we discuss methods that freeze\nparts of a network at its random initialization. By freezing weights, the\nnumber of trainable parameters is shrunken which reduces gradient computations\nand the dimensionality of the model's optimization space. In this survey we\nfirst propose dimensionality reduced training as an underlying mathematical\nmodel that covers pruning and freezing during training. Afterwards, we present\nand discuss different dimensionality reduced training methods.",

Our experiments verify MWP solvers are easy to be\nbiased by the biased training datasets which do not cover diverse questions for\neach problem narrative of all MWPs, thus a solver can only learn shallow\nheuristics rather than deep semantics for understanding problems. Besides, an\nMWP can be naturally solved by multiple equivalent equations while current\ndatasets take only one of the equivalent equations as ground truth, forcing the\nmodel to match the labeled ground truth and ignoring other equivalent\nequations. Here, we first introduce a novel MWP dataset named UnbiasedMWP which\nis constructed by varying the grounded expressions in our collected data and\nannotating them with corresponding multiple new questions manually.

    "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and\ntransformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive\ndeployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free\nnetworks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware\nimplementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise\nshifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However,\nmultiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts\nin terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs\nthat consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less\npowerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes\nShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more\nefficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it\nintegrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both\nmultiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the\ndevelopment of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight\nsharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different\noperators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for\nconvolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a\nlargely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive\nexperiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks\nconsistently validate the efficacy of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a\n+7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score compared to state-of-the-art\nNN, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively.\nCodes and pretrained models are available at\nhttps://github.com/RICE-EIC/ShiftAddNAS.",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning (TL) in natural language processing (NLP) has seen a surge\nof interest in recent years, as pre-trained models have shown an impressive\nability to transfer to novel tasks. Three main strategies have emerged for\nmaking use of multiple supervised datasets during fine-tuning: training on an\nintermediate task before training on the target task (STILTs), using multi-task\nlearning (MTL) to train jointly on a supplementary task and the target task\n(pairwise MTL), or simply using MTL to train jointly on all available datasets\n(MTL-ALL). In this work, we compare all three TL methods in a comprehensive\nanalysis on the GLUE dataset suite. We find that there is a simple heuristic\nfor when to use one of these techniques over the other: pairwise MTL is better\nthan STILTs when the target task has fewer instances than the supporting task\nand vice versa. We show that this holds true in more than 92% of applicable\ncases on the GLUE dataset and validate this hypothesis with experiments varying\ndataset size. The simplicity and effectiveness of this heuristic is surprising\nand warrants additional exploration by the TL community. Furthermore, we find\nthat MTL-ALL is worse than the pairwise methods in almost every case. We hope\nthis study will aid others as they choose between TL methods for NLP tasks.",

    "abstract": "General-purpose robots require diverse repertoires of behaviors to complete\nchallenging tasks in real-world unstructured environments. To address this\nissue, goal-conditioned reinforcement learning aims to acquire policies that\ncan reach configurable goals for a wide range of tasks on command. However,\nsuch goal-conditioned policies are notoriously difficult and time-consuming to\ntrain from scratch. In this paper, we propose Planning to Practice (PTP), a\nmethod that makes it practical to train goal-conditioned policies for\nlong-horizon tasks that require multiple distinct types of interactions to\nsolve. Our approach is based on two key ideas. First, we decompose the\ngoal-reaching problem hierarchically, with a high-level planner that sets\nintermediate subgoals using conditional subgoal generators in the latent space\nfor a low-level model-free policy. Second, we propose a hybrid approach which\nfirst pre-trains both the conditional subgoal generator and the policy on\npreviously collected data through offline reinforcement learning, and then\nfine-tunes the policy via online exploration. This fine-tuning process is\nitself facilitated by the planned subgoals, which breaks down the original\ntarget task into short-horizon goal-reaching tasks that are significantly\neasier to learn. We conduct experiments in both the simulation and real world,\nin which the policy is pre-trained on demonstrations of short primitive\nbehaviors and fine-tuned for temporally extended tasks that are unseen in the\noffline data. Our experimental results show that PTP can generate feasible\nsequences of subgoals that enable the policy to efficiently solve the target\ntasks.",

    "abstract": "Vision-and-language tasks have increasingly drawn more attention as a means\nto evaluate human-like reasoning in machine learning models. A popular task in\nthe field is visual question answering (VQA), which aims to answer questions\nabout images. However, VQA models have been shown to exploit language bias by\nlearning the statistical correlations between questions and answers without\nlooking into the image content: e.g., questions about the color of a banana are\nanswered with yellow, even if the banana in the image is green. If societal\nbias (e.g., sexism, racism, ableism, etc.) is present in the training data,\nthis problem may be causing VQA models to learn harmful stereotypes. For this\nreason, we investigate gender and racial bias in five VQA datasets. In our\nanalysis, we find that the distribution of answers is highly different between\nquestions about women and men, as well as the existence of detrimental\ngender-stereotypical samples. Likewise, we identify that specific race-related\nattributes are underrepresented, whereas potentially discriminatory samples\nappear in the analyzed datasets. Our findings suggest that there are dangers\nassociated to using VQA datasets without considering and dealing with the\npotentially harmful stereotypes.

To solve\nthis problem, this work investigates a novel multimodal stacked ensemble-based\napproach (SEMIFND) to fake news detection.

We consider\na natural and well-studied structural restriction on automata, namely the\ndegree of ambiguity, which is defined as the maximum number of accepting runs\nover all words. The known undecidability proofs exploits infinite ambiguity and\nso we focus on the case of finitely ambiguous probabilistic automata. Our main\ncontributions are to construct efficient algorithms for analysing finitely\nambiguous probabilistic automata through a reduction to a multi-objective\noptimisation problem called the stochastic path problem. We obtain a polynomial\ntime algorithm for approximating the value of probabilistic automata of fixed\nambiguity and a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for the emptiness problem for\n2-ambiguous probabilistic automata. We complement these positive results by an\ninapproximability result stating that the value of finitely ambiguous\nprobabilistic automata cannot be approximated unless PTIME = NP.",

    "abstract": "The past two decades have seen a growing interest in combining causal\ninformation, commonly represented using causal graphs, with machine learning\nmodels. Probability trees provide a simple yet powerful alternative\nrepresentation of causal information. They enable both computation of\nintervention and counterfactuals, and are strictly more general, since they\nallow context-dependent causal dependencies. Here we present a Bayesian method\nfor learning probability trees from a combination of interventional and\nobservational data. The method quantifies the expected information gain from an\nintervention, and selects the interventions with the largest gain. We\ndemonstrate the efficiency of the method on simulated and real data. An\neffective method for learning probability trees on a limited interventional\nbudget will greatly expand their applicability.",

Unlike previous works\non speech representation learning, which learns multilingual contextual speech\nembedding at the resolution of an acoustic frame (10-20ms), this work focuses\non learning multimodal (speech-text) multilingual speech embedding at the\nresolution of a sentence (5-10s) such that the embedding vector space is\nsemantically aligned across different languages. We combine state-of-the-art\nmultilingual acoustic frame-level speech representation learning model XLS-R\nwith the Language Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding (LaBSE) model to create an\nutterance-level multimodal multilingual speech encoder SAMU-XLSR. Although we\ntrain SAMU-XLSR with only multilingual transcribed speech data, cross-lingual\nspeech-text and speech-speech associations emerge in its learned representation\nspace. To substantiate our claims, we use SAMU-XLSR speech encoder in\ncombination with a pre-trained LaBSE text sentence encoder for cross-lingual\nspeech-to-text translation retrieval, and SAMU-XLSR alone for cross-lingual\nspeech-to-speech translation retrieval. We highlight these applications by\nperforming several cross-lingual text and speech translation retrieval tasks\nacross several datasets.",

We show that models pre-trained on Wikidata\nKG with our method outperform the T5 baselines on FreebaseQA and WikiHop, as\nwell as the Wikidata-answerable subset of TriviaQA and NaturalQuestions. The\nmodels pre-trained on factual triples compare competitively with the ones on\nnatural language sentences that contain the same knowledge. Trained on a\nsmaller size KG, WikiMovies, we saw 3x improvement of exact match score on\nMetaQA task compared to T5 baseline.

The morally good is often defined in\ncausal terms, as in whether one's actions have in fact caused a particular\noutcome, and whether the outcome could have been anticipated. We propose an\nonline reinforcement learning method that learns a policy under the constraint\nthat the agent should not be the cause of harm. This is accomplished by\ndefining cause using the theory of actual causation and assigning blame to the\nagent when its actions are the actual cause of an undesirable outcome. We\nconduct experiments on a toy ethical dilemma in which a natural choice of\nreward function leads to clearly undesirable behavior, but our method learns a\npolicy that avoids being the cause of harmful behavior, demonstrating the\nsoundness of our approach.

The goal is to reach\na consensus configuration in which every agent shares the same opinion. To this\nend, agents randomly sample other agents and update their opinion according to\na simple update function depending on the sampled opinions.\nWe consider two communication models: the gossip model and a variant of the\npopulation model. In the gossip model, agents are activated in parallel,\nsynchronous rounds. In the population model, one agent is activated after the\nother in a sequence of discrete time steps. For both models we analyze the\nfollowing natural family of majority processes called $j$-Majority: when\nactivated, every agent samples $j$ other agents uniformly at random (with\nreplacement) and adopts the majority opinion among the sample (breaking ties\nuniformly at random). As our main result we show a hierarchy among majority\nprotocols: $(j+1)$-Majority (for $j > 1$) converges stochastically faster than\n$j$-Majority for any initial opinion configuration.

    "abstract": "Stereo visual odometry is widely used where a robot tracks its position and\norientation using stereo cameras. Most of the approaches recovered mobile\nrobotics motion based on the matching and tracking of point features along a\nsequence of stereo images. But in low-textured and dynamic scenes, there are no\nsufficient robust static point features for motion estimation, causing lots of\nprevious work to fail to reconstruct the robotic motion. However, line features\ncan be detected in such low-textured and dynamic scenes. In this paper, we\nproposed DynPL-SVO, a stereo visual odometry with the $dynamic$ $grid$\nalgorithm and the cost function containing both vertical and horizontal\ninformation of the line features. Stereo camera motion was obtained through\nLevenberg-Marquard minimization of re-projection error of point and line\nfeatures.

By\ndesign, DSC can tackle class imbalance; however, it does not recognize instance\nimbalance within a class. As a result, a large foreground instance can dominate\nminor instances and still produce a satisfactory Sorensen Dice coefficient.\nNevertheless, missing out on instances will lead to poor detection performance.\nThis represents a critical issue in applications such as disease progression\nmonitoring. For example, it is imperative to locate and surveil small-scale\nlesions in the follow-up of multiple sclerosis patients.

The proposed approximation scheme,\ncalled efficient hyperinterpolation, achieves satisfactory accuracy with fewer\nnumerical integration points than the original scheme. The implementation of\nthe new approximation scheme is relatively easy.

In particular, we cast the task as binary sequence labelling and\nfine-tune a pre-trained transformer using a simple policy gradient approach.\nOur approach outperforms other unsupervised models while also being more\nefficient at inference time.",

    "abstract": "Scheduling the batch size to increase is an effective strategy to control\ngradient noise when training deep neural networks. Current approaches implement\nscheduling heuristics that neglect structure within the optimization procedure,\nlimiting their flexibility to the training dynamics and capacity to discern the\nimpact of their adaptations on generalization. We introduce Arbiter as a new\nhyperparameter optimization algorithm to perform batch size adaptations for\nlearnable scheduling heuristics using gradients from a meta-objective function,\nwhich overcomes previous heuristic constraints by enforcing a novel learning\nprocess called hyper-learning. With hyper-learning, Arbiter formulates a neural\nnetwork agent to generate optimal batch size samples for an inner deep network\nby learning an adaptive heuristic through observing concomitant responses over\nT inner descent steps. Arbiter avoids unrolled optimization, and does not\nrequire hypernetworks to facilitate gradients, making it reasonably cheap,\nsimple to implement, and versatile to different tasks. We demonstrate Arbiter's\neffectiveness in several illustrative experiments: to act as a stand-alone\nbatch size scheduler; to complement fixed batch size schedules with greater\nflexibility; and to promote variance reduction during stochastic\nmeta-optimization of the learning rate.",

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning models have made great progress in MWP solving on\nanswer accuracy. However, they are uninterpretable since they mainly rely on\nshallow heuristics to achieve high performance without understanding and\nreasoning the grounded math logic. To address this issue and make a step\ntowards interpretable MWP solving, we first construct a high-quality MWP\ndataset named InterMWP which consists of 11,495 MWPs and annotates\ninterpretable logical formulas based on algebraic knowledge as the grounded\nlinguistic logic of each solution equation. Different from existing MWP\ndatasets, our InterMWP benchmark asks for a solver to not only output the\nsolution expressions but also predict the corresponding logical formulas. We\nfurther propose a novel approach with logical prompt and interpretation\ngeneration, called LogicSolver. For each MWP, our LogicSolver first retrieves\nsome highly-correlated algebraic knowledge and then passes them to the backbone\nmodel as prompts to improve the semantic representations of MWPs. With these\nimproved semantic representations, our LogicSolver generates corresponding\nsolution expressions and interpretable knowledge formulas in accord with the\ngenerated solution expressions, simultaneously. Experimental results show that\nour LogicSolver has stronger logical formula-based interpretability than\nbaselines while achieving higher answer accuracy with the help of logical\nprompts, simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "We study settings where gradient penalties are used alongside risk\nminimization with the goal of obtaining predictors satisfying different notions\nof monotonicity. Specifically, we present two sets of contributions. In the\nfirst part of the paper, we show that different choices of penalties define the\nregions of the input space where the property is observed. As such, previous\nmethods result in models that are monotonic only in a small volume of the input\nspace. We thus propose an approach that uses mixtures of training instances and\nrandom points to populate the space and enforce the penalty in a much larger\nregion. As a second set of contributions, we introduce regularization\nstrategies that enforce other notions of monotonicity in different settings. In\nthis case, we consider applications, such as image classification and\ngenerative modeling, where monotonicity is not a hard constraint but can help\nimprove some aspects of the model. Namely, we show that inducing monotonicity\ncan be beneficial in applications such as: (1) allowing for controllable data\ngeneration, (2) defining strategies to detect anomalous data, and (3)\ngenerating explanations for predictions. Our proposed approaches do not\nintroduce relevant computational overhead while leading to efficient procedures\nthat provide extra benefits over baseline models.",

While Web-based chatbots are getting popular, they have not received\nmuch scrutiny from security researchers. The benefits to owners come at the\ncost of users' privacy and security. Vulnerabilities, such as tracking cookies\nand third-party domains, can be hidden in the chatbot's iFrame script. This\npaper presents a large-scale analysis of five Web-based chatbots among the top\n1-million Alexa websites. Through our crawler tool, we identify the presence of\nchatbots in these 1-million websites. We discover that 13,515 out of the top\n1-million Alexa websites (1.59%) use one of the five analysed chatbots. Our\nanalysis reveals that the top 300k Alexa ranking websites are dominated by\nIntercom chatbots that embed the least number of third-party domains. LiveChat\nchatbots dominate the remaining websites and embed the highest samples of\nthird-party domains. We also find that 850 (6.29%) of the chatbots use insecure\nprotocols to transfer users' chats in plain text. Furthermore, some chatbots\nheavily rely on cookies for tracking and advertisement purposes. More than\ntwo-thirds (68.92%) of the identified cookies in chatbot iFrames are used for\nads and tracking users. Our results show that, despite the promises for\nprivacy, security, and anonymity given by the majority of the websites,\nmillions of users may unknowingly be subject to poor security guarantees by\nchatbot service providers",

    "title": "A two-steps approach to improve the performance of Android malware  detectors",
    "abstract": "The popularity of Android OS has made it an appealing target to malware\ndevelopers. To evade detection, including by ML-based techniques, attackers\ninvest in creating malware that closely resemble legitimate apps. In this\npaper, we propose GUIDED RETRAINING, a supervised representation learning-based\nmethod that boosts the performance of a malware detector. First, the dataset is\nsplit into \"easy\" and \"difficult\" samples, where difficulty is associated to\nthe prediction probabilities yielded by a malware detector: for difficult\nsamples, the probabilities are such that the classifier is not confident on the\npredictions, which have high error rates. Then, we apply our GUIDED RETRAINING\nmethod on the difficult samples to improve their classification. For the subset\nof \"easy\" samples, the base malware detector is used to make the final\npredictions since the error rate on that subset is low by construction. For the\nsubset of \"difficult\" samples, we rely on GUIDED RETRAINING, which leverages\nthe correct predictions and the errors made by the base malware detector to\nguide the retraining process. GUIDED RETRAINING focuses on the difficult\nsamples: it learns new embeddings of these samples using Supervised Contrastive\nLearning and trains an auxiliary classifier for the final predictions. We\nvalidate our method on four state-of-the-art Android malware detection\napproaches using over 265k malware and benign apps, and we demonstrate that\nGUIDED RETRAINING can reduce up to 40.41% prediction errors made by the malware\ndetectors. Our method is generic and designed to enhance the classification\nperformance on a binary classification task. Consequently, it can be applied to\nother classification problems beyond Android malware detection.",

In this framework, a\nmulti-functional base station (BS) carries out target sensing, while providing\nedge computing services to the nearby users. To enhance the computation\nefficiency, the multi-tier computing structure is exploited, where the BS can\nfurther offload the computation tasks to a powerful Cloud server (CS). The\npotential benefits of employing NOMA in the proposed JCSMC framework are\ninvestigated, which can maximize the computation offloading capacity and\nsuppress the inter-function interference. Based on the proposed framework, the\ntransmit beamformer of the BS and computation resource allocation at the BS and\nthe CS are jointly optimized to maximize the computation rate subject to the\ncommunication-computation causality and the sensing quality constraints. Both\npartial and binary computation offloading modes are considered: 1) For the\npartial offloading mode, a weighted minimum mean square error based alternating\noptimization algorithm is proposed to solve the corresponding non-convex\noptimization problem. It is proved that a KKT optimal solution can be obtained;\n2) For the binary offloading mode, the resultant highly-coupled mixed-integer\noptimization problem is first transformed to an equivalent but more tractable\nform. Then, the reformulated problem is solved by utilizing the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers approach to obtain a nearly optimal solution.\nFinally, numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms\nand the proposed NOMA-aided JCSMC framework",

In this\npaper, we propose to model a math word problem in a fine-to-coarse manner to\ncapture both the local fine-grained information and the global logical\nstructure of it. Instead of generating a complete equation sequence or\nexpression tree from the global features, we iteratively combine low-level\noperands to predict a higher-level operator, abstracting the problem and\nreasoning about the solving operators from bottom to up.

    "abstract": "On-demand provisioning in the cloud allows for services to remain available\ndespite massive denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Unfortunately, on-demand\nprovisioning is expensive and must be weighed against the costs incurred by an\nadversary. This leads to a recent threat known as economic\ndenial-of-sustainability (EDoS), where the cost for defending a service is\nhigher than that of attacking.\nA natural approach for combating EDoS is to impose costs via resource burning\n(RB). Here, a client must verifiably consume resources -- for example, by\nsolving a computational challenge -- before service is rendered. However, prior\napproaches with security guarantees do not account for the cost on-demand\nprovisioning.\nAnother valuable defensive tool is to use a classifier in order to discern\ngood jobs from a legitimate client, versus bad jobs from the adversary.\nHowever, while useful, uncertainty arises from classification error, which\nstill allows bad jobs to consume server resources. Thus, classification is not\na solution by itself.\nHere, we propose an EDoS defense, RootDef, that leverages both RB and\nclassification, while accounting for both the costs of resource burning and\non-demand provisioning. Specifically, against an adversary that expends $B$\nresources to attack, the total cost for defending is $\\tilde{O}( \\sqrt{B\\,g} +\nB^{2/3} + g)$, where $g$ is the number of good jobs and $\\tilde{O}$ refers to\nhidden logarithmic factors in the total number of jobs $n$. Notably, for large\n$B$ relative to $g$, the adversary has higher cost, implying that the algorithm\nhas an economic advantage. Finally, we prove a lower bound showing that RootDef\nhas total costs that are asymptotically tight up to logarithmic factors in $n$.",

A\nfairness-aware recommender system aims to treat different user groups\nsimilarly. Relevant work on user-oriented fairness highlights the\ndiscriminative behavior of fairness-unaware recommendation algorithms towards a\ncertain user group, defined based on users' activity level. Typical solutions\ninclude proposing a user-centered fairness re-ranking framework applied on top\nof a base ranking model to mitigate its unfair behavior towards a certain user\ngroup i.e., disadvantaged group. In this paper, we re-produce a user-oriented\nfairness study and provide extensive experiments to analyze the dependency of\ntheir proposed method on various fairness and recommendation aspects, including\nthe recommendation domain, nature of the base ranking model, and user grouping\nmethod. Moreover, we evaluate the final recommendations provided by the\nre-ranking framework from both user- (e.g., NDCG, user-fairness) and item-side\n(e.g., novelty, item-fairness) metrics. We discover interesting trends and\ntrade-offs between the model's performance in terms of different evaluation\nmetrics. For instance, we see that the definition of the\nadvantaged/disadvantaged user groups plays a crucial role in the effectiveness\nof the fairness algorithm and how it improves the performance of specific base\nranking models.

    "abstract": "Over recent decades, scenarios and scenario-based software/system engineering\nhave been actively employed as essential tools to handle intricate problems,\nvalidate requirements, and support stakeholders' communication. However,\ndespite the widespread use of scenarios, there have been several challenges for\nengineers to more willingly utilize scenario-based engineering approaches\n(i.e., scenario methods) in their projects. First, the term scenario has\nnumerous published definitions, thus lacking in a well-established shared\nunderstanding of scenarios and scenario methods. Second, the conceptual basis\nfor engineers developing or employing scenarios is missing. To establish shared\nunderstanding and to find common denominators of scenario methods, this study\nleverages well-defined metamodeling and conceptualization that systematically\ninvestigate the concepts under analysis and define core entities and their\nrelations. By conducting a semi-systematic literature review, conceptual\nvariables are collected and conceptualized as a conceptual meta-model. As a\nresult, this study introduces scenario variables (SVs) that represent\nconstructs/semantics of scenario descriptions, according to 4 levels of\nconstructs of a scenario method. To evaluate the comprehensibility and\napplicability of the defined variables, we analyze five existing scenario\nmethods and their instances in automated driving system (ADS) domains. The\nresults showed that our conceptual model and its constituent scenario variables\nadequately support the understanding of a scenario method and provide a means\nfor comparative analysis between different scenario methods.",

Neural networks are now consistently\nused as universal function approximators for data with underlying mechanisms\nthat are incompletely understood or exceedingly complex. However, neural\nnetworks alone ignore the fundamental laws of physics and often fail to make\nplausible predictions. Here we integrate data, physics, and uncertainties by\ncombining neural networks, physics-informed modeling, and Bayesian inference to\nimprove the predictive potential of traditional neural network models. We embed\nthe physical model of a damped harmonic oscillator into a fully-connected\nfeed-forward neural network to explore a simple and illustrative model system,\nthe outbreak dynamics of COVID-19. Our Physics-Informed Neural Networks can\nseamlessly integrate data and physics, robustly solve forward and inverse\nproblems, and perform well for both interpolation and extrapolation, even for a\nsmall amount of noisy and incomplete data. At only minor additional cost, they\ncan self-adaptively learn the weighting between data and physics. Combined with\nBayesian Neural Networks, they can serve as priors in a Bayesian Inference, and\nprovide credible intervals for uncertainty quantification. Our study reveals\nthe inherent advantages and disadvantages of Neural Networks, Bayesian\nInference, and a combination of both and provides valuable guidelines for model\nselection. While we have only demonstrated these approaches for the simple\nmodel problem of a seasonal endemic infectious disease, we anticipate that the\nunderlying concepts and trends generalize to more complex disease conditions\nand, more broadly, to a wide variety of nonlinear dynamical systems.",

However, both techniques still suffer\nfrom being computationally expensive and requiring large amounts of training\ndata. This problem is especially prevalent in real-world robotic manipulation\ntasks, where access to ground truth scene features is not available and\npolicies are instead learned from raw camera observations. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the efficacy of learning image keypoints via the Dense\nCorrespondence pretext task for downstream policy learning. Extending prior\nwork to challenging multi-object scenes, we show that our model can be trained\nto deal with important problems in representation learning, primarily\nscale-invariance and occlusion. We evaluate our approach on diverse robot\nmanipulation tasks, compare it to other visual representation learning\napproaches, and demonstrate its flexibility and effectiveness for\nsample-efficient policy learning.",

    "abstract": "Recent image matting studies are developing towards proposing trimap-free or\ninteractive methods for complete complex image matting tasks. Although avoiding\nthe extensive labors of trimap annotation, existing methods still suffer from\ntwo limitations: (1) For the single image with multiple objects, it is\nessential to provide extra interaction information to help determining the\nmatting target; (2) For transparent objects, the accurate regression of alpha\nmatte from RGB image is much more difficult compared with the opaque ones. In\nthis work, we propose a Unified Interactive image Matting method, named UIM,\nwhich solves the limitations and achieves satisfying matting results for any\nscenario. Specifically, UIM leverages multiple types of user interaction to\navoid the ambiguity of multiple matting targets, and we compare the pros and\ncons of different annotation types in detail. To unify the matting performance\nfor transparent and opaque objects, we decouple image matting into two stages,\ni.e., foreground segmentation and transparency prediction. Moreover, we design\na multi-scale attentive fusion module to alleviate the vagueness in the\nboundary region. Experimental results demonstrate that UIM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the Composition-1K test set and a synthetic\nunified dataset. Our code and models will be released soon.",

For the deployment of such FH\nlinks, operators are faced with the challenge of maintaining acceptable radio\naccess performance while at the same time keeping deployment costs low. A\ncommon practice is to exploit statistical multiplexing by allowing several\ncells to utilize the same FH link. As a result, in order to cope with the\nresulting aggregated traffic, different techniques can be used to reduce the\nrequired FH data rates. Herein, we focus on FH compression control strategies\nfor multiple-cell/multiple-user scenarios sharing a common FH link. We propose\nvarious methods for sounding reference signal (SRS) handling and analyze\ndifferent FH-aware modulation data compression and scheduling strategies.\nConsidering a full system setup, including the radio and FH access networks,\nnumerical evaluation is conducted using a 5G NR system-level simulator\nimplemented in ns-3.

    "abstract": "When training neural rankers using Large Language Models, it's expected that\na practitioner would make use of multiple GPUs to accelerate the training time.\nBy using more devices, deep learning frameworks, like PyTorch, allow the user\nto drastically increase the available VRAM pool, making larger batches possible\nwhen training, therefore shrinking training time. At the same time, one of the\nmost critical processes, that is generally overlooked when running data-hungry\nmodels, is how data is managed between disk, main memory and VRAM. Most open\nsource research implementations overlook this memory hierarchy, and instead\nresort to loading all documents from disk to main memory and then allowing the\nframework (e.g., PyTorch) to handle moving data into VRAM. Therefore, with the\nincreasing sizes of datasets dedicated to IR research, a natural question\narises: s this the optimal solution for optimizing training time? We here study\nhow three different popular approaches to handling documents for IR datasets\nbehave and how they scale with multiple GPUs. Namely, loading documents\ndirectly into memory, reading documents directly from text files with a lookup\ntable and using a library for handling IR datasets (ir_datasets) differ, both\nin performance (i.e. samples processed per second) and memory footprint. We\nshow that, when using the most popular libraries for neural ranker research\n(i.e. PyTorch and Hugging Face's Transformers), the practice of loading all\ndocuments into main memory is not always the fastest option and is not feasible\nfor setups with more than a couple GPUs. Meanwhile, a good implementation of\ndata streaming from disk can be faster, while being considerably more scalable.\nWe also show how popular techniques for improving loading times, like memory\npining, multiple workers, and RAMDISK usage, can reduce the training time\nfurther with minor memory overhead.",

We introduce a compartmental model for studying the spreading of a\nmalware and of the awareness of its incidence through different waves which are\nevolving on top of the same graph structure (the global network of connected\ndevices). This is realized by considering vectorial compartments made of two\ncomponents, the first being descriptive of the state of the device with respect\nto the new malware's propagation, and the second accounting for the awareness\nof the device's user about the presence of the cyber threat. By introducing\nsuitable transition rates between such compartments, one can then follow the\nevolution of a cyber-epidemic from the moment at which a new virus is seeded in\nthe network, up to when a given user realizes that his/her device has suffered\na damage and consequently starts a wave of awareness which eventually ends up\nwith the development of a proper antivirus software.

    "abstract": "One of the main objectives of Cloud Providers (CP) is to guarantee the\nService-Level Agreement (SLA) of customers while reducing operating costs. To\nachieve this goal, CPs have built large-scale datacenters. This leads, however,\nto underutilized resources and an increase in costs. A way to improve the\nutilization of resources is to reclaim the unused parts and resell them at a\nlower price. Providing SLA guarantees to customers on reclaimed resources is a\nchallenge due to their high volatility. Some state-of-the-art solutions\nconsider keeping a proportion of resources free to absorb sudden variation in\nworkloads. Others consider stable resources on top of the volatile ones to fill\nin for the lost resources. However, these strategies either reduce the amount\nof reclaimable resources or operate on less volatile ones such as Amazon Spot\ninstance. In this paper, we proposed RISCLESS, a Reinforcement Learning\nstrategy to exploit unused Cloud resources. Our approach consists of using a\nsmall proportion of stable on-demand resources alongside the ephemeral ones in\norder to guarantee customers SLA and reduce the overall costs. The approach\ndecides when and how much stable resources to allocate in order to fulfill\ncustomers' demands. RISCLESS improved the CPs' profits by an average of 15.9%\ncompared to state-of-the-art strategies.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel multimodal fusion model, DouFu, for trajectory\nrepresentation joint learning, which applies multimodal learning and attention\nfusion module to capture the internal characteristics of trajectories. We first\ndesign movement, route, and global features generated from the trajectory data\nand urban functional zones and then analyze them respectively with the\nattention encoder or feed forward network.

Minimum tournaments having\nthis property have been explored very well in the 1960's and the early 1970's.\nIn this paper, we define a strengthening of the $S_k$-property that we name\n\"strong $S_k$-property\". We show, first, that several basic results on the\nweaker notion remain valid for the stronger notion (and the corresponding\nmodification of the proofs requires only little extra-effort). Second, it is\ndemonstrated that the stronger notion has applications in the area of Teaching.\nSpecifically, we present an infinite family of concept classes all of which can\nbe taught with a single example in the No-Clash model of teaching while, in\norder to teach a class $\\cC$ of this family in the recursive model of teaching,\norder of $\\log|\\cC|$ many examples are required. This is the first paper that\npresents a concrete and easily constructible family of concept classes which\nseparates the No-Clash from the recursive model of teaching by more than a\nconstant factor. The separation by a logarithmic factor is remarkable because\nthe recursive teaching dimension is known to be bounded by $\\log |\\cC|$ for any\nconcept class $\\cC$.",

    "title": "Perturbation of Deep Autoencoder Weights for Model Compression and  Classification of Tabular Data",
    "abstract": "Fully connected deep neural networks (DNN) often include redundant weights\nleading to overfitting and high memory requirements. Additionally, the\nperformance of DNN is often challenged by traditional machine learning models\nin tabular data classification. In this paper, we propose periodical\nperturbations (prune and regrow) of DNN weights, especially at the\nself-supervised pre-training stage of deep autoencoders. The proposed weight\nperturbation strategy outperforms dropout learning in four out of six tabular\ndata sets in downstream classification tasks. The L1 or L2 regularization of\nweights at the same pretraining stage results in inferior classification\nperformance compared to dropout or our weight perturbation routine. Unlike\ndropout learning, the proposed weight perturbation routine additionally\nachieves 15% to 40% sparsity across six tabular data sets for the compression\nof deep pretrained models. Our experiments reveal that a pretrained deep\nautoencoder with weight perturbation or dropout can outperform traditional\nmachine learning in tabular data classification when fully connected DNN fails\nmiserably. However, traditional machine learning models appear superior to any\ndeep models when a tabular data set contains uncorrelated variables. Therefore,\nthe success of deep models can be attributed to the inevitable presence of\ncorrelated variables in real-world data sets.",

LPC-AD is motivated by the ever-increasing\nneeds for fast and accurate MTS anomaly detection methods to support fast\ntroubleshooting in cloud computing, micro-service systems, etc. LPC-AD is fast\nin the sense that its reduces the training time by as high as 38.2% compared to\nthe state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning methods that focus on training speed.\nLPC-AD is accurate in the sense that it improves the detection accuracy by as\nhigh as 18.9% compared to SOTA sophisticated deep learning methods that focus\non enhancing detection accuracy. Methodologically, LPC-AD contributes a generic\narchitecture LPC-Reconstruct for one to attain different trade-offs between\ntraining speed and detection accuracy. More specifically, LPC-Reconstruct is\nbuilt on ideas from autoencoder for reducing redundancy in time series, latent\npredictive coding for capturing temporal dependence in MTS, and randomized\nperturbation for avoiding overfitting of anomalous dependence in the training\ndata. We present simple instantiations of LPC-Reconstruct to attain fast\ntraining speed, where we propose a simple randomized perturbation method. The\nsuperior performance of LPC-AD over SOTA methods is validated by extensive\nexperiments on four large real-world datasets. Experiment results also show the\nnecessity and benefit of each component of the LPC-Reconstruct architecture and\nthat LPC-AD is robust to hyper parameters.",

For\nconvenience, we refer to it as a network gradient descent (NGD) method. In the\nNGD method, only statistics (e.g., parameter estimates) need to be\ncommunicated, minimizing the risk of privacy. Meanwhile, different clients\ncommunicate with each other directly according to a carefully designed network\nstructure without a central master. This greatly enhances the reliability of\nthe entire algorithm. Those nice properties inspire us to carefully study the\nNGD method both theoretically and numerically. Theoretically, we start with a\nclassical linear regression model.

The resulting NGD estimator can be statistically as\nefficient as the global estimator, if the learning rate is sufficiently small\nand the network structure is well balanced, even if the data are distributed\nheterogeneously. Those interesting findings are then extended to general models\nand loss functions. Extensive numerical studies are presented to corroborate\nour theoretical findings.

    "abstract": "Preoperative opioid use has been reported to be associated with higher\npreoperative opioid demand, worse postoperative outcomes, and increased\npostoperative healthcare utilization and expenditures. Understanding the risk\nof preoperative opioid use helps establish patient-centered pain management. In\nthe field of machine learning, deep neural network (DNN) has emerged as a\npowerful means for risk assessment because of its superb prediction power;\nhowever, the blackbox algorithms may make the results less interpretable than\nstatistical models. Bridging the gap between the statistical and machine\nlearning fields, we propose a novel Interpretable Neural Network Regression\n(INNER), which combines the strengths of statistical and DNN models. We use the\nproposed INNER to conduct individualized risk assessment of preoperative opioid\nuse. Intensive simulations and an analysis of 34,186 patients expecting surgery\nin the Analgesic Outcomes Study (AOS) show that the proposed INNER not only can\naccurately predict the preoperative opioid use using preoperative\ncharacteristics as DNN, but also can estimate the patient specific odds of\nopioid use without pain and the odds ratio of opioid use for a unit increase in\nthe reported overall body pain, leading to more straightforward interpretations\nof the tendency to use opioids than DNN. Our results identify the patient\ncharacteristics that are strongly associated with opioid use and is largely\nconsistent with the previous findings, providing evidence that INNER is a\nuseful tool for individualized risk assessment of preoperative opioid use.",

    "abstract": "In seismic data processing, accurate and efficient automatic velocity picking\nalgorithms can significantly accelerate the processing, and the main branch is\nto use velocity spectra for velocity pickup. Recently, machine learning\nalgorithms have been widely used in automatic spectrum picking. Even though\ndeep learning methods can address the problem well in supervised cases, they\nare often accompanied by expensive computational costs and low\ninterpretability. On the contrast, unsupervised learning methods based on the\nphysical knowledge have great potential to efficiently resolve the task. In\nthis paper, we propose an unsupervised ensemble learning (UEL) method to pick\nthe root mean square (RMS) velocities on the spectrum. In particular, UEL\nutilizes the information of nearby velocity spectra and the nearest seed\nvelocity curve to assist the selection of effective and reasonable velocity\npoints. To increase the coherence of energy peaks, an information gain method\nis developed by local normalization. In addition, we designed the attention\nscale-space filter (ASSF) clustering method to incorporate the coherence\ninformation into the picking process. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate\nthat compared to traditional clustering methods, UEL can recognize energy\nclusters better, especially with smaller blobs. Moreover, the injection of\nnearby spectra and interval velocity constraint in UEL significantly improves\nthe robustness and accuracy of picking results.",

We consider audio, text, and video modalities, as well as all\npossible multimodal combinations of those, and find that text alone has the\nleast bias, and accounts for the majority of the models' performances, raising\ndoubts about the worthiness of multimodal emotion recognition systems when bias\nand fairness are desired alongside model performance.",

    "title": "Deep Learning of Chaotic Systems from Partially-Observed Data",
    "abstract": "Recently, a general data driven numerical framework has been developed for\nlearning and modeling of unknown dynamical systems using fully- or\npartially-observed data. The method utilizes deep neural networks (DNNs) to\nconstruct a model for the flow map of the unknown system. Once an accurate DNN\napproximation of the flow map is constructed, it can be recursively executed to\nserve as an effective predictive model of the unknown system. In this paper, we\napply this framework to chaotic systems, in particular the well-known Lorenz 63\nand 96 systems, and critically examine the predictive performance of the\napproach. A distinct feature of chaotic systems is that even the smallest\nperturbations will lead to large (albeit bounded) deviations in the solution\ntrajectories. This makes long-term predictions of the method, or any data\ndriven methods, questionable, as the local model accuracy will eventually\ndegrade and lead to large pointwise errors. Here we employ several other\nqualitative and quantitative measures to determine whether the chaotic dynamics\nhave been learned. These include phase plots, histograms, autocorrelation,\ncorrelation dimension, approximate entropy, and Lyapunov exponent. Using these\nmeasures, we demonstrate that the flow map based DNN learning method is capable\nof accurately modeling chaotic systems, even when only a subset of the state\nvariables are available to the DNNs. For example, for the Lorenz 96 system with\n40 state variables, when data of only 3 variables are available, the method is\nable to learn an effective DNN model for the 3 variables and produce accurately\nthe chaotic behavior of the system.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and reliable building footprint maps are vital to urban planning and\nmonitoring, and most existing approaches fall back on convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) for building footprint generation. However, one limitation of\nthese methods is that they require strong supervisory information from massive\nannotated samples for network learning. State-of-the-art semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation networks with consistency training can help to deal with\nthis issue by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data, which encourages the\nconsistency of model output on data perturbation. Considering that rich\ninformation is also encoded in feature maps, we propose to integrate the\nconsistency of both features and outputs in the end-to-end network training of\nunlabeled samples, enabling to impose additional constraints. Prior\nsemi-supervised semantic segmentation networks have established the cluster\nassumption, in which the decision boundary should lie in the vicinity of low\nsample density. In this work, we observe that for building footprint\ngeneration, the low-density regions are more apparent at the intermediate\nfeature representations within the encoder than the encoder's input or output.\nTherefore, we propose an instruction to assign the perturbation to the\nintermediate feature representations within the encoder, which considers the\nspatial resolution of input remote sensing imagery and the mean size of\nindividual buildings in the study area.

    "abstract": "K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is one of the earliest and most established\nalgorithms in machine learning. For regression tasks, KNN averages the targets\nwithin a neighborhood which poses a number of challenges: the neighborhood\ndefinition is crucial for the predictive performance as neighbors might be\nselected based on uninformative features, and averaging does not account for\nhow the function changes locally. We propose a novel method called Differential\nNearest Neighbors Regression (DNNR) that addresses both issues simultaneously:\nduring training, DNNR estimates local gradients to scale the features; during\ninference, it performs an n-th order Taylor approximation using estimated\ngradients. In a large-scale evaluation on over 250 datasets, we find that DNNR\nperforms comparably to state-of-the-art gradient boosting methods and MLPs\nwhile maintaining the simplicity and transparency of KNN. This allows us to\nderive theoretical error bounds and inspect failures. In times that call for\ntransparency of ML models, DNNR provides a good balance between performance and\ninterpretability.",

    "abstract": "Blockchains provide environments where parties can interact transparently and\nsecurely peer-to-peer without needing a trusted third party. Parties can trust\nthe integrity and correctness of transactions and the verifiable execution of\nbinary code on the blockchain (smart contracts) inside the system. Including\ninformation from outside of the blockchain remains challenging. A challenge is\ndata privacy. In a public system, shared data becomes public and, coming from a\nsingle source, often lacks credibility. A private system gives the parties\ncontrol over their data and sources but trades in positive aspects as\ntransparency. Often, not the data itself is the most critical information but\nthe result of a computation performed on it.\nAn example is research data certification. To keep data private but still\nprove data provenance, researchers can store a hash value of that data on the\nblockchain. This hash value is either calculated locally on private data\nwithout the chance for validation or is calculated on the blockchain, meaning\nthat data must be published and stored on the blockchain -- a problem of the\noverall data amount stored on and distributed with the ledger. A system we\ncalled moving smart contracts bypasses this problem: Data remain local, but\ntrusted nodes can access them and execute trusted smart contract code stored on\nthe blockchain.

    "abstract": "Vehicle control algorithms exploiting connectivity and automation, such as\nConnected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) or Advanced Driver Assistance Systems\n(ADAS), have the opportunity to improve energy savings. However, lower levels\nof automation involve a human-machine interaction stage, where the presence of\na human driver affects the performance of the control algorithm in closed loop.\nThis occurs for instance in the case of Eco-Driving control algorithms\nimplemented as a velocity advisory system, where the driver is displayed an\noptimal speed trajectory to follow to reduce energy consumption. Achieving the\ncontrol objectives relies on the human driver perfectly following the\nrecommended speed. If the driver is unable to follow the recommended speed, a\ndecline in energy savings and poor vehicle performance may occur. This warrants\nthe creation of methods to model and forecast the response of a human driver\nwhen operating in the loop with a speed advisory system.\nThis work focuses on developing a sequence to sequence long-short term memory\n(LSTM)-based driver behavior model that models the interaction of the human\ndriver to a suggested desired vehicle speed trajectory in real-world\nconditions. A driving simulator is used for data collection and training the\ndriver model, which is then compared against the driving data and a\ndeterministic model. Results show close proximity of the LSTM-based model with\nthe driving data, demonstrating that the model can be adopted as a tool to\ndesign human-centered speed advisory systems.",

First, we prove a folklore result for secure\nsummation - to compute $1$ bit of the sum securely, each user needs to send at\nleast $1$ bit to the server, each user needs to hold a key of at least $1$ bit,\nand all users need to hold collectively some key variables of at least $K-1$\nbits. Next, we focus on the symmetric groupwise key setting, where every group\nof $G$ users share an independent key. We show that for symmetric groupwise\nkeys with group size $G$, when $G > K-T$, the secure summation problem is not\nfeasible; when $G \\leq K-T$, to compute $1$ bit of the sum securely, each user\nneeds to send at least $1$ bit to the server and the size of each groupwise key\nis at least $(K-T-1)/\\binom{K-T}{G}$ bits.

    "abstract": "Voice assistants record sound and can overhear conversations. Thus, a consent\nmanagement mechanism is desirable such that users can express their wish to be\nrecorded or not. Consent management can be implemented using speaker\nrecognition; users that do not give consent enrol their voice and all further\nrecordings of these users is subsequently not processed. Building speaker\nrecognition based consent management is challenging due to the dynamic nature\nof the problem, required scalability for large number of speakers, and need for\nfast speaker recognition with high accuracy. This paper describes a speaker\nrecognition based consent management system addressing the aforementioned\nchallenges. A fully supervised batch contrastive learning is applied to learn\nthe underlying speaker equivariance inductive bias during the training on the\nset of speakers noting recording dissent. Speakers that do not provide consent\nare grouped in buckets which are trained continuously. The embeddings are\ncontrastively learned for speakers in their buckets during training and act\nlater as a replay buffer for classification. The buckets are progressively\nregistered during training and a novel multi-strided random sampling of the\ncontrastive embedding replay buffer is proposed. Buckets are contrastively\ntrained for a few steps only in each iteration and replayed for classification\nprogressively leading to fast convergence. An algorithm for fast and dynamic\nregistration and removal of speakers in buckets is described. The evaluation\nresults show that the proposed approach provides the desired fast and dynamic\nsolution for consent management and outperforms existing approaches in terms of\nconvergence speed and adaptive capabilities as well as verification performance\nduring inference.",

An EV has two major components, which\nmake it different from traditional vehicles, first is its environment friendly\nnature because of being electric, and second is the interconnection ability of\nthese vehicles because of modern information and communication technologies\n(ICTs). Both of these features are playing a key role in the development of\nEVs, and both academia and industry personals are working towards development\nof modern protocols for EV networks. All these interactions, whether from\nenergy perspective or from communication perspective, both are generating a\ntremendous amount of data every day. In order to get most out of this data\ncollected from EVs, research works have highlighted the use of machine/deep\nlearning techniques for various EV applications. This interaction is quite\nfruitful, but it also comes with a critical concern of privacy leakage during\ncollection, storage, and training of vehicular data. Therefore, alongside\ndeveloping machine/deep learning techniques for EVs, it is also critical to\nensure that they are resilient to private information leakage and attacks. In\nthis paper, we begin with the discussion about essential background on EVs and\nprivacy preservation techniques, followed by a brief overview of privacy\npreservation in EVs using machine learning techniques. Particularly, we also\nfocus on an in-depth review of the integration of privacy techniques in EVs and\nhighlighted different application scenarios in EVs.

While these strategies\nappear to be related to robust losses -- like the Huber loss -- they are built\non semi-gradient update rules which do not minimize a known loss. In this work,\nwe build on recent insights reformulating squared Bellman errors as a\nsaddlepoint optimization problem and propose a saddlepoint reformulation for a\nHuber Bellman error and Absolute Bellman error.

Models based on\nconvolutional networks (CNN), transformers, and combinations of them have been\nproposed to segment polyps with promising results. However, those approaches\nhave limitations either in modeling the local appearance of the polyps only or\nlack of multi-level features for spatial dependency in the decoding process.\nThis paper proposes a novel network, namely ColonFormer, to address these\nlimitations. ColonFormer is an encoder-decoder architecture with the capability\nof modeling long-range semantic information at both encoder and decoder\nbranches. The encoder is a lightweight architecture based on transformers for\nmodeling global semantic relations at multi scales. The decoder is a\nhierarchical network structure designed for learning multi-level features to\nenrich feature representation. Besides, a refinement module is added with a new\nskip connection technique to refine the boundary of polyp objects in the global\nmap for accurate segmentation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on\nfive popular benchmark datasets for polyp segmentation, including Kvasir,\nCVC-Clinic DB, CVCColonDB, EndoScene, and ETIS.

    "title": "Opportunistic Routing in Quantum Networks",
    "abstract": "Unlike classical routing algorithms, quantum routing algorithms make use of\nentangled states - a type of resources that have a limited lifetime and need to\nbe regenerated after consumption. In a nutshell, quantum routing algorithms\nhave to use these resources efficiently, while optimizing some objectives such\nas the total waiting time. Current routing algorithms tend to keep a routing\nrequest waiting until all of the resources on its path are available. In this\npaper, we introduce a new way of managing entanglement resources in an\nopportunistic fashion: a request can move forward along its path as soon as\npossible (even if some resources on its path are not ready). We show that this\nopportunistic approach is fundamentally better than conventional approaches. In\nparticular, our results indicate that this new approach achieves a 30-50%\nimprovement in the average total waiting time and average link waiting time\ncompared with several state-of-the-art routing algorithms. As a by-product of\nthis work, we develop a new simulator for quantum routing, which can be used to\nevaluate various design choices under different scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Multiquery planning algorithms find paths between various different starts\nand goals in a single search space. They are designed to do so efficiently by\nreusing information across planning queries. This information may be computed\nbefore or during the search and often includes knowledge of valid paths. Using\nknown valid paths to solve an individual planning query takes less\ncomputational effort than finding a completely new solution. This allows\nmultiquery algorithms, such as PRM*, to outperform single-query algorithms,\nsuch as RRT*, on many problems but their relative performance depends on how\nmuch information is reused. Despite this, few multiquery planners explicitly\nseek to maximize path reuse and, as a result, many do not consistently\noutperform single-query alternatives. This paper presents Effort Informed\nRoadmaps (EIRM*), an almost-surely asymptotically optimal multiquery planning\nalgorithm that explicitly prioritizes reusing computational effort. EIRM* uses\nan asymmetric bidirectional search to identify existing paths that may help\nsolve an individual planning query and then uses this information to order its\nsearch and reduce computational effort. This allows it to find initial\nsolutions up to an order-of-magnitude faster than state-of-the-art planning\nalgorithms on the tested abstract and robotic multiquery planning problems.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks are widely deployed models across many scientific disciplines\nand commercial endeavors ranging from edge computing and sensing to large-scale\nsignal processing in data centers. The most efficient and well-entrenched\nmethod to train such networks is backpropagation, or reverse-mode automatic\ndifferentiation. To counter an exponentially increasing energy budget in the\nartificial intelligence sector, there has been recent interest in analog\nimplementations of neural networks, specifically nanophotonic neural networks\nfor which no analog backpropagation demonstration exists. We design\nmass-manufacturable silicon photonic neural networks that alternately cascade\nour custom designed \"photonic mesh\" accelerator with digitally implemented\nnonlinearities. These reconfigurable photonic meshes program computationally\nintensive arbitrary matrix multiplication by setting physical voltages that\ntune the interference of optically encoded input data propagating through\nintegrated Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks. Here, using our packaged\nphotonic chip, we demonstrate in situ backpropagation for the first time to\nsolve classification tasks and evaluate a new protocol to keep the entire\ngradient measurement and update of physical device voltages in the analog\ndomain, improving on past theoretical proposals. Our method is made possible by\nintroducing three changes to typical photonic meshes: (1) measurements at\noptical \"grating tap\" monitors, (2) bidirectional optical signal propagation\nautomated by fiber switch, and (3) universal generation and readout of optical\namplitude and phase. After training, our classification achieves accuracies\nsimilar to digital equivalents even in presence of systematic error. Our\nfindings suggest a new training paradigm for photonics-accelerated artificial\nintelligence based entirely on a physical analog of the popular backpropagation\ntechnique.",

This test bed aims to evaluate application protocols\nconsidered in the transport layer of the standard IEC-61850. The application is\na data gathering system, where IEC-61850 messages are transmitted from and\nbetween different elements in a microgrid system, such as IED, publishers, and\nsubscribers, which are node elements that are part of the utility grid. The\nstandard IEC-61850 defines many protocols, such as SV, GOOSE, and MMS, each of\nthem with a variety of requirements and sharing similar transport communication\nprotocols, such as TCP and UDP. Hence, a testing framework is used in the test\nbed in order to evaluate the performance of these protocols aiming to enable\nthe communication in a real microgrid deployment. The IEC-61850 messages\ntransported by TCP or UDP are transmitted to a centralized location, where a\nlocal database stores the information under different test scenarios and using\ndifferent transmission sample times. The overall results are promising and\nindicate that the protocols based on TCP in combination with a 5G cellular\nnetwork architecture would be suitable for most applications within the studied\nmicrogrid case.

We show that a single infected node increases the expected age\nof a fully connected network from $O(\\log n)$ to $O(n)$. Further, we show that\nthe optimal behavior for an adversary is to reset the timestamps of all\noutgoing packets to the current time and of all incoming packets to an outdated\ntime. Additionally, if the adversary allows the infected node to accept a small\nfraction of incoming packets from the network, then a large network can manage\nto curb the spread of stale files coming from the infected node and pull the\nnetwork age back to $O(\\log n)$. Lastly, we show that if an infected node\ncontacts only a single node instead of all nodes of the network, the system age\ncan still be degraded to $O(n)$.

Photonic cryptographic hash functions, which use photonic integrated\ncircuits to accelerate computation, promise energy efficiency for verifying\ntransactions and mining in a cryptonetwork. Like many analog computing\napproaches, however, current proposals for photonic cryptographic hash\nfunctions that promise similar security guarantees as Bitcoin are susceptible\nto systematic error, so multiple devices may not reach a consensus on\ncomputation despite high numerical precision (associated with low photodetector\nnoise).

The difficulty of LightHash can be\nadjusted to be sufficiently tolerant to systematic error (calibration error,\nloss error, coupling error, and phase error) and preserve inherent security\nguarantees present in the Bitcoin protocol.

In this paper, we present a novel attack\nmethod FILM for federated learning of language models -- for the first time, we\nshow the feasibility of recovering text from large batch sizes of up to 128\nsentences. Different from image-recovery methods which are optimized to match\ngradients, we take a distinct approach that first identifies a set of words\nfrom gradients and then directly reconstructs sentences based on beam search\nand a prior-based reordering strategy. The key insight of our attack is to\nleverage either prior knowledge in pre-trained language models or memorization\nduring training. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that FILM can work well\nwith several large-scale datasets -- it can extract single sentences with high\nfidelity even for large batch sizes and recover multiple sentences from the\nbatch successfully if the attack is applied iteratively. We hope our results\ncan motivate future work in developing stronger attacks as well as new defense\nmethods for training language models in federated learning.

    "abstract": "Real-time streaming communication requires a high quality of service despite\ncontending with packet loss. Streaming codes are a class of codes best suited\nfor this setting. A key challenge for streaming codes is that they operate in\nan \"online\" setting in which the amount of data to be transmitted varies over\ntime and is not known in advance. Mitigating the adverse effects of variability\nrequires spreading the data that arrives at a time slot over multiple future\npackets, and the optimal strategy for spreading depends on the arrival pattern.\nAlgebraic coding techniques alone are therefore insufficient for designing\nrate-optimal codes. We combine algebraic coding techniques with a\nlearning-augmented algorithm for spreading to design the first approximately\nrate-optimal streaming codes for a range of parameter regimes that are\nimportant for practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Constrained random test generation is one the most widely adopted methods for\ngenerating stimuli for simulation-based verification. Randomness leads to test\ndiversity, but tests tend to repeatedly exercise the same design logic.\nConstraints are written (typically manually) to bias random tests towards\ninteresting, hard-to-reach, and yet-untested logic. However, as verification\nprogresses, most constrained random tests yield little to no effect on\nfunctional coverage. If stimuli generation consumes significantly less\nresources than simulation, then a better approach involves randomly generating\na large number tests, selecting the most effective subset, and only simulating\nthat subset. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for automatic\nconstraint extraction and test selection. This method, which we call\ncoverage-directed test selection, is based on supervised learning from coverage\nfeedback. Our method biases selection towards tests that have a high\nprobability of increasing functional coverage, and prioritises them for\nsimulation. We show how coverage-directed test selection can reduce manual\nconstraint writing, prioritise effective tests, reduce verification resource\nconsumption, and accelerate coverage closure on a large, real-life industrial\nhardware design.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates a simple yet powerful adapter for Vision Transformer\n(ViT). Unlike recent visual transformers that introduce vision-specific\ninductive biases into their architectures, ViT achieves inferior performance on\ndense prediction tasks due to lacking prior information of images. To solve\nthis issue, we propose a Vision Transformer Adapter (ViT-Adapter), which can\nremedy the defects of ViT and achieve comparable performance to vision-specific\nmodels by introducing inductive biases via an additional architecture.\nSpecifically, the backbone in our framework is a vanilla transformer that can\nbe pre-trained with multi-modal data. When fine-tuning on downstream tasks, a\nmodality-specific adapter is used to introduce the data and tasks' prior\ninformation into the model, making it suitable for these tasks. We verify the\neffectiveness of our ViT-Adapter on multiple downstream tasks, including object\ndetection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Notably, when\nusing HTC++, our ViT-Adapter-L yields 60.1 box AP and 52.1 mask AP on COCO\ntest-dev, surpassing Swin-L by 1.4 box AP and 1.0 mask AP. For semantic\nsegmentation, our ViT-Adapter-L establishes a new state-of-the-art of 60.5 mIoU\non ADE20K val, 0.6 points higher than SwinV2-G. We hope that the proposed\nViT-Adapter could serve as an alternative for vision-specific transformers and\nfacilitate future research.",

However, the\nwhole production process is prohibitively time-consuming and labor-intensive.\nTo democratize this technology to a larger audience, we propose AvatarCLIP, a\nzero-shot text-driven framework for 3D avatar generation and animation. Unlike\nprofessional software that requires expert knowledge, AvatarCLIP empowers\nlayman users to customize a 3D avatar with the desired shape and texture, and\ndrive the avatar with the described motions using solely natural languages. Our\nkey insight is to take advantage of the powerful vision-language model CLIP for\nsupervising neural human generation, in terms of 3D geometry, texture and\nanimation. Specifically, driven by natural language descriptions, we initialize\n3D human geometry generation with a shape VAE network. Based on the generated\n3D human shapes, a volume rendering model is utilized to further facilitate\ngeometry sculpting and texture generation. Moreover, by leveraging the priors\nlearned in the motion VAE, a CLIP-guided reference-based motion synthesis\nmethod is proposed for the animation of the generated 3D avatar. Extensive\nqualitative and quantitative experiments validate the effectiveness and\ngeneralizability of AvatarCLIP on a wide range of avatars.

    "title": "Fat-Tailed Variational Inference with Anisotropic Tail Adaptive Flows",
    "abstract": "While fat-tailed densities commonly arise as posterior and marginal\ndistributions in robust models and scale mixtures, they present challenges when\nGaussian-based variational inference fails to capture tail decay accurately. We\nfirst improve previous theory on tails of Lipschitz flows by quantifying how\nthe tails affect the rate of tail decay and by expanding the theory to\nnon-Lipschitz polynomial flows. Then, we develop an alternative theory for\nmultivariate tail parameters which is sensitive to tail-anisotropy. In doing\nso, we unveil a fundamental problem which plagues many existing flow-based\nmethods: they can only model tail-isotropic distributions (i.e., distributions\nhaving the same tail parameter in every direction). To mitigate this and enable\nmodeling of tail-anisotropic targets, we propose anisotropic tail-adaptive\nflows (ATAF). Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world targets\nconfirm that ATAF is competitive with prior work while also exhibiting\nappropriate tail-anisotropy.",

    "abstract": "We now need more than ever to make genome analysis more intelligent. We need\nto read, analyze, and interpret our genomes not only quickly, but also\naccurately and efficiently enough to scale the analysis to population level.\nThere currently exist major computational bottlenecks and inefficiencies\nthroughout the entire genome analysis pipeline, because state-of-the-art genome\nsequencing technologies are still not able to read a genome in its entirety. We\ndescribe the ongoing journey in significantly improving the performance,\naccuracy, and efficiency of genome analysis using intelligent algorithms and\nhardware architectures. We explain state-of-the-art algorithmic methods and\nhardware-based acceleration approaches for each step of the genome analysis\npipeline and provide experimental evaluations. Algorithmic approaches exploit\nthe structure of the genome as well as the structure of the underlying\nhardware. Hardware-based acceleration approaches exploit specialized\nmicroarchitectures or various execution paradigms (e.g., processing inside or\nnear memory) along with algorithmic changes, leading to new hardware/software\nco-designed systems. We conclude with a foreshadowing of future challenges,\nbenefits, and research directions triggered by the development of both very low\ncost yet highly error prone new sequencing technologies and specialized\nhardware chips for genomics. We hope that these efforts and the challenges we\ndiscuss provide a foundation for future work in making genome analysis more\nintelligent.

    "title": "An Exponentially Increasing Step-size for Parameter Estimation in  Statistical Models",
    "abstract": "Using gradient descent (GD) with fixed or decaying step-size is standard\npractice in unconstrained optimization problems. However, when the loss\nfunction is only locally convex, such a step-size schedule artificially slows\nGD down as it cannot explore the flat curvature of the loss function. To\novercome that issue, we propose to exponentially increase the step-size of the\nGD algorithm. Under homogeneous assumptions on the loss function, we\ndemonstrate that the iterates of the proposed \\emph{exponential step size\ngradient descent} (EGD) algorithm converge linearly to the optimal solution.\nLeveraging that optimization insight, we then consider using the EGD algorithm\nfor solving parameter estimation under non-regular statistical models whose the\nloss function becomes locally convex when the sample size goes to infinity. We\ndemonstrate that the EGD iterates reach the final statistical radius within the\ntrue parameter after a logarithmic number of iterations, which is in stark\ncontrast to a \\emph{polynomial} number of iterations of the GD algorithm.\nTherefore, the total computational complexity of the EGD algorithm is\n\\emph{optimal} and exponentially cheaper than that of the GD for solving\nparameter estimation in non-regular statistical models. To the best of our\nknowledge, it resolves a long-standing gap between statistical and algorithmic\ncomputational complexities of parameter estimation in non-regular statistical\nmodels. Finally, we provide targeted applications of the general theory to\nseveral classes of statistical models, including generalized linear models with\npolynomial link functions and location Gaussian mixture models.",

In recent years, multiple\ncomprehensive ADMET systems that adopt advanced machine learning models have\nbeen developed, providing services to estimate multiple endpoints. However,\nthose ADMET systems usually suffer from weak extrapolation ability. First, due\nto the lack of labelled data for each endpoint, typical machine learning models\nperform frail for the molecules with unobserved scaffolds. Second, most systems\nonly provide fixed built-in endpoints and cannot be customised to satisfy\nvarious research requirements. To this end, we develop a robust and endpoint\nextensible ADMET system, HelixADMET (H-ADMET). H-ADMET incorporates the concept\nof self-supervised learning to produce a robust pre-trained model. The model is\nthen fine-tuned with a multi-task and multi-stage framework to transfer\nknowledge between ADMET endpoints, auxiliary tasks, and self-supervised tasks.\nOur results demonstrate that H-ADMET achieves an overall improvement of 4%,\ncompared with existing ADMET systems on comparable endpoints.

Quantum simulations, simulation of chemical reactions,\nsolution of optimization problems and quantum neural networks are some\nexamples. However, problems such as noise, limited number of qubits and circuit\ndepth, and gradient vanishing must be resolved before we can use them to their\nfull potential. In the field of quantum machine learning, several models have\nbeen proposed. In general, in order to train these different models, we use the\ngradient of a cost function with respect to the model parameters. In order to\nobtain this gradient, we must compute the derivative of this function with\nrespect to the model parameters. For this we can use the method called\nparameter-shift rule. This method consists of evaluating the cost function\ntwice for each parameter of the quantum network. A problem with this method is\nthat the number of evaluations grows linearly with the number of parameters. In\nthis work we study an alternative method, called Natural Evolutionary\nStrategies (NES), which are a family of black box optimization algorithms. An\nadvantage of the NES method is that in using it one can control the number of\ntimes the cost function will be evaluated.

In studies with a mismatch between an AI normal\nreport and the original radiologist report, a consensus read by two\nboard-certified radiologists was conducted to make the final diagnosis.\nResults: After the exclusion of cases not meeting the study criteria, 9579\ncases were analysed by AI.

The number of\ncases correctly found nonsignificant by AI was 1692 (17.7% of all studies and\n36.4% of studies with no significant findings). After the consensus read, there\nwere nine confirmed false-negative studies. These studies included four cases\nof slightly enlarged heart size, four cases of slightly increased pulmonary\nopacification and one case with a small unilateral pleural effusion.

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing quantity of multivariate process data is driving a need\nfor skilled engineers to analyze, interpret, and build models from such data.\nMultivariate data analytics relies heavily on linear algebra, optimization, and\nstatistics and can be challenging for students to understand given that most\ncurricula do not have strong coverage in the latter three topics. This article\ndescribes interactive software -- the Latent Variable Demonstrator (LAVADE) --\nfor teaching, learning, and understanding latent variable methods. In this\nsoftware, users can interactively compare latent variable methods such as\nPartial Least Squares (PLS), and Principal Component Regression (PCR) with\nother regression methods such as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection\nOperator (lasso), Ridge Regression (RR), and Elastic Net (EN). LAVADE helps to\nbuild intuition on choosing appropriate methods, hyperparameter tuning, and\nmodel coefficient interpretation, fostering a conceptual understanding of the\nalgorithms' differences. The software contains a data generation method and\nthree chemical process datasets, allowing for comparing results of datasets\nwith different levels of complexity. LAVADE is released as open-source software\nso that others can apply and advance the tool for use in teaching or research.",

    "title": "Composing General Audio Representation by Fusing Multilayer Features of  a Pre-trained Model",
    "abstract": "Many application studies rely on audio DNN models pre-trained on a\nlarge-scale dataset as essential feature extractors, and they extract features\nfrom the last layers. In this study, we focus on our finding that the middle\nlayer features of existing supervised pre-trained models are more effective\nthan the late layer features for some tasks. We propose a simple approach to\ncompose features effective for general-purpose applications, consisting of two\nsteps: (1) calculating feature vectors along the time frame from middle/late\nlayer outputs, and (2) fusing them. This approach improves the utility of\nfrequency and channel information in downstream processes, and combines the\neffectiveness of middle and late layer features for different tasks. As a\nresult, the feature vectors become effective for general purposes. In the\nexperiments using VGGish, PANNs' CNN14, and AST on nine downstream tasks, we\nfirst show that each layer output of these models serves different tasks. Then,\nwe demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves their\nperformance and brings it to a level comparable to that of the\nstate-of-the-art. In particular, the performance of the non-semantic speech\n(NOSS) tasks greatly improves, especially on Speech commands V2 with VGGish of\n+77.1 (14.3% to 91.4%).",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound-guided nerve block anesthesia (UGNB) is a high-tech visual nerve\nblock anesthesia method that can observe the target nerve and its surrounding\nstructures, the puncture needle's advancement, and local anesthetics spread in\nreal-time. The key in UGNB is nerve identification. With the help of deep\nlearning methods, the automatic identification or segmentation of nerves can be\nrealized, assisting doctors in completing nerve block anesthesia accurately and\nefficiently. Here, we establish a public dataset containing 320 ultrasound\nimages of brachial plexus (BP). Three experienced doctors jointly produce the\nBP segmentation ground truth and label brachial plexus trunks. We design a\nbrachial plexus segmentation system (BPSegSys) based on deep learning. BPSegSys\nachieves experienced-doctor-level nerve identification performance in various\nexperiments. We evaluate BPSegSys' performance in terms of\nintersection-over-union (IoU), a commonly used performance measure for\nsegmentation experiments. Considering three dataset groups in our established\npublic dataset, the IoU of BPSegSys are 0.5238, 0.4715, and 0.5029,\nrespectively, which exceed the IoU 0.5205, 0.4704, and 0.4979 of experienced\ndoctors.

    "abstract": "Felsner, Hurtado, Noy and Streinu (2000) conjectured that arrangement graphs\nof simple great-circle arrangements have chromatic number at most $3$.\nMotivated by this conjecture, we study the colorability of arrangement graphs\nfor different classes of arrangements of (pseudo-)circles.\nIn this paper the conjecture is verified for $\\triangle$-saturated\npseudocircle arrangements, i.e., for arrangements where one color class of the\n2-coloring of faces consists of triangles only, as well as for further classes\nof (pseudo-)circle arrangements. These results are complemented by a\nconstruction which maps $\\triangle$-saturated arrangements with a pentagonal\nface to arrangements with 4-chromatic 4-regular arrangement graphs. This\n\"corona\" construction has similarities with the crowning construction\nintroduced by Koester (1985). Based on exhaustive experiments with small\narrangements we propose three strengthenings of the original conjecture.\nWe also investigate fractional colorings. It is shown that the arrangement\ngraph of every arrangement $\\mathcal{A}$ of pairwise intersecting pseudocircles\nis \"close\" to being $3$-colorable. More precisely, the fractional chromatic\nnumber $\\chi_f(\\mathcal{A})$ of the arrangement graph is bounded from above by\n$\\chi_f(\\mathcal{A}) \\le 3+O(\\frac{1}{n})$, where $n$ is the number of\npseudocircles of $\\mathcal{A}$. Furthermore, we construct an infinite family of\n$4$-edge-critical $4$-regular planar graphs which are fractionally\n$3$-colorable. This disproves a conjecture of Gimbel, K\\\"{u}ndgen, Li, and\nThomassen (2019).",

    "abstract": "This article studies the infinite-width limit of deep feedforward neural\nnetworks whose weights are dependent, and modelled via a mixture of Gaussian\ndistributions. Each hidden node of the network is assigned a nonnegative random\nvariable that controls the variance of the outgoing weights of that node. We\nmake minimal assumptions on these per-node random variables: they are iid and\ntheir sum, in each layer, converges to some finite random variable in the\ninfinite-width limit. Under this model, we show that each layer of the\ninfinite-width neural network can be characterised by two simple quantities: a\nnon-negative scalar parameter and a L\\'evy measure on the positive reals. If\nthe scalar parameters are strictly positive and the L\\'evy measures are trivial\nat all hidden layers, then one recovers the classical Gaussian process (GP)\nlimit, obtained with iid Gaussian weights. More interestingly, if the L\\'evy\nmeasure of at least one layer is non-trivial, we obtain a mixture of Gaussian\nprocesses (MoGP) in the large-width limit. The behaviour of the neural network\nin this regime is very different from the GP regime. One obtains correlated\noutputs, with non-Gaussian distributions, possibly with heavy tails.\nAdditionally, we show that, in this regime, the weights are compressible, and\nfeature learning is possible. Many sparsity-promoting neural network models can\nbe recast as special cases of our approach, and we discuss their infinite-width\nlimits; we also present an asymptotic analysis of the pruning error. We\nillustrate some of the benefits of the MoGP regime over the GP regime in terms\nof representation learning and compressibility on simulated, MNIST and Fashion\nMNIST datasets.",

Our analysis relies on showing that, up to a minor\ndebiasing trick, the ROP measurement operator satisfies a generalised sign\nproduct embedding (SPE) property. In a nutshell, the SPE shows that the scalar\nproduct of a signal sketch with the \"sign\" of the sketch of a given pattern\napproximates the square of the projection of that signal on this pattern.

This tool is intended to make it possible to explore new schemes of\ntreatment delivery, possibly with future enhanced technologies. The\noptimization framework is designed to be versatile and to account for many\ndegrees of freedom, without any {\\it a priori} technological constraint. To\ntest the behavior of our algorithm, we propose in this paper, as an example, to\noptimize beam fluences, target points and irradiation directions at the same\ntime.\nThe proposed optimization routine takes typically into account several\nthousands of spots of fixed size.

The\nfigure-of-merit (or fitness) is based on an objective function relative to the\ndose prescription to the tumor and to the limits set for organs at risk and\nnormal tissues. Fluence optimization is carried out via a specific scheme based\non a plain gradient with analytical solution.

Accurate MD simulations require computationally\ndemanding quantum-mechanical calculations, being practically limited to short\ntimescales and few atoms. For larger systems, efficient, but much less reliable\nempirical force fields are used. Recently, machine learned force fields (MLFFs)\nemerged as an alternative means to execute MD simulations, offering similar\naccuracy as ab initio methods at orders-of-magnitude speedup. Until now, MLFFs\nmainly capture short-range interactions in small molecules or periodic\nmaterials, due to the increased complexity of constructing models and obtaining\nreliable reference data for large molecules, where long-ranged many-body\neffects become important. This work proposes a general approach to constructing\naccurate MLFFs for large-scale molecular simulations (GEMS) by training on\n\"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" molecular fragments of varying size, from which the\nrelevant physicochemical interactions can be learned. GEMS is applied to study\nthe dynamics of alanine-based peptides and the 46-residue protein crambin in\naqueous solution, allowing nanosecond-scale MD simulations of >25k atoms at\nessentially ab initio quality. Our findings suggest that structural motifs in\npeptides and proteins are more flexible than previously thought, indicating\nthat simulations at ab initio accuracy might be necessary to understand dynamic\nbiomolecular processes such as protein (mis)folding, drug-protein binding, or\nallosteric regulation.",

That is, given a collection of time\nseries over a varying parameter, when has the structure of the underlying\ndynamical system changed? For this task, we turn to the field of topological\ndata analysis (TDA), which encodes information about the shape and structure of\ndata. The idea of utilizing tools from TDA for signal processing tasks, known\nas topological signal processing (TSP), has gained much attention in recent\nyears, largely through a standard pipeline that computes the persistent\nhomology of the point cloud generated by the Takens' embedding. However, this\nprocedure is limited by computation time since the simplicial complex generated\nin this case is large, but also has a great deal of redundant data. For this\nreason, we turn to a more recent method for encoding the structure of the\nattractor, which constructs an ordinal partition network (OPN) representing\ninformation about when the dynamical system has passed between certain regions\nof state space. The result is a weighted graph whose structure encodes\ninformation about the underlying attractor. Our previous work began to find\nways to package the information of the OPN in a manner that is amenable to TDA;\nhowever, that work only used the network structure and did nothing to encode\nthe additional weighting information. In this paper, we take the next step:\nbuilding a pipeline to analyze the weighted OPN with TDA and showing that this\nframework provides more resilience to noise or perturbations in the system and\nimproves the accuracy of the dynamic state detection.",

    "abstract": "If a measure of voting power assigns greater voting power to a player because\nit no longer effectively cooperates with another, then the measure displays the\nquarrelling paradox and violates the quarrel postulate. We provide formal\ncriteria by which to judge whether a given conception of quarrelling is (a)\nreasonable and (b) fit to serve as the basis for a reasonable quarrel\npostulate. To achieve this, we formalize a general framework distinguishing\nbetween three degrees of quarrelling (weak, strong, cataclysmic), symmetric vs.\nasymmetrical quarrels, and reciprocal vs. non-reciprocal quarrels, and which\nthereby yields twelve conceptions of quarrelling, which encompasses the two\nconceptions proposed by Felsenthal and Machover and by Laruelle and Valenciano,\nrespectively. We argue that the two existing formulations of the quarrel\npostulate based on these conceptions are unreasonable. In contrast, we prove\nthat the symmetric, weak conception of quarrelling identified by our framework\n-- whether reciprocal or not -- is fit to serve as the basis for a reasonable\nquarrel postulate. Furthermore, the classic Shapley-Shubik index and\nPenrose-Banzhaf measure both satisfy the quarrel postulate based on a symmetric\nweak quarrel.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasonography is an important routine examination for breast cancer\ndiagnosis, due to its non-invasive, radiation-free and low-cost properties.\nHowever, it is still not the first-line screening test for breast cancer due to\nits inherent limitations. It would be a tremendous success if we can precisely\ndiagnose breast cancer by breast ultrasound images (BUS). Many learning-based\ncomputer-aided diagnostic methods have been proposed to achieve breast cancer\ndiagnosis/lesion classification. However, most of them require a pre-define ROI\nand then classify the lesion inside the ROI. Conventional classification\nbackbones, such as VGG16 and ResNet50, can achieve promising classification\nresults with no ROI requirement. But these models lack interpretability, thus\nrestricting their use in clinical practice. In this study, we propose a novel\nROI-free model for breast cancer diagnosis in ultrasound images with\ninterpretable feature representations. We leverage the anatomical prior\nknowledge that malignant and benign tumors have different spatial relationships\nbetween different tissue layers, and propose a HoVer-Transformer to formulate\nthis prior knowledge. The proposed HoVer-Trans block extracts the inter- and\nintra-layer spatial information horizontally and vertically. We conduct and\nrelease an open dataset GDPH&GYFYY for breast cancer diagnosis in BUS. The\nproposed model is evaluated in three datasets by comparing with four CNN-based\nmodels and two vision transformer models via a five-fold cross validation. It\nachieves state-of-the-art classification performance with the best model\ninterpretability.",

Characterized by a maximum\ndose deposition at the end of the proton trajectory followed by a sharp\nfall-off, proton beams can deliver a highly conformal dose to the tumor while\nsparing organs at risk and surrounding healthy tissues. New treatment planning\nsystems based on spot scanning techniques can now propose multi-field\noptimization. However, in most cases, this optimization only processes the\nfield fluences whereas the choice of ballistics (field geometry) is left to the\noncologist and medical physicist.\nIn this work, we investigate a new optimization framework based on a genetic\napproach.

We propose to\noptimize simultaneously the target points and beam incidence angles in a\ncontinuous manner and with a variable number of beams. No \\textit{a priori}\ntechnological constraints are taken into account, \\textit{i.e.}~the beam energy\nvalues, incidence directions and target points are free parameters.\nThe proposed algorithm is based on a modified version of classical genetic\noperators: mutation, crossover and selection. We use the real coding associated\nwith random perturbations of the parameters to obtain a continuous variation of\nthe potential solutions. We also introduce a perturbation in the exchange\npoints of the crossover to allow variations of the number of beams. These\nvariations are controlled by introducing a beam fluence lower limit.\nIn this paper, we present a complete description of the algorithm and of its\nbehaviour in an elementary test case.

With the rapid development of\nmachine learning algorithms, dry electrode techniques, and different real-world\napplications of the brain-computer interface for normal individuals, emotion\ncategorization from EEG data has recently gotten a lot of attention.\nElectroencephalogram (EEG) signals are a critical resource for these systems.\nThe primary benefit of employing EEG signals is that they reflect true emotion\nand are easily resolved by computer systems. In this work, EEG signals\nassociated with good, neutral, and negative emotions were identified using\nchannel selection preprocessing. However, researchers had a limited grasp of\nthe specifics of the link between various emotional states until now. To\nidentify EEG signals, we used discrete wavelet transform and machine learning\ntechniques such as recurrent neural network (RNN) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN)\nalgorithm. Initially, the classifier methods were utilized for channel\nselection. As a result, final feature vectors were created by integrating the\nfeatures of EEG segments from these channels.

    "abstract": "Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) is an unsolved problem in the field of\ncomputational biology. The problem of protein structure prediction is about\npredicting the native conformation of a protein, while its sequence of amino\nacids is known. Regarding processing limitations of current computer systems,\nall-atom simulations for proteins are typically unpractical; several reduced\nmodels of proteins have been proposed. Additionally, due to intrinsic hardness\nof calculations even in reduced models, many computational methods mainly based\non artificial intelligence have been proposed to solve the problem. Agent-based\nmodeling is a relatively new method for modeling systems composed of\ninteracting items. In this paper we proposed a new approach for protein\nstructure prediction by using agent-based modeling (ABM) in two dimensional\nhydrophobic-hydrophilic model. We broke the whole process of protein structure\nprediction into two steps: the first step, which was introduced in our previous\npaper, is about biasing the linear sequence to gain a primary energy, and the\nnext step, which will be explained in this paper, is about using ABM with a\npredefined set of rules, to find the best conformation in the least possible\namount of time and steps. This method was implemented in NETLOGO. We have\ntested this algorithm on several benchmark sequences ranging from 20 to 50-mers\nin two dimensional Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic lattice models. Comparing to the\nresult of the other algorithms, our method is capable of finding the best known\nconformations in a significantly shorter time. A major problem in PSP\nsimulation is that as the sequence length increases the time consumed to\npredict a valid structure will exponentially increase. In contrast, by using\nMAS2HP the effect of increase in sequence length on spent time has changed from\nexponentially to linear.",

    "title": "Covariance Estimation: Optimal Dimension-free Guarantees for Adversarial  Corruption and Heavy Tails",
    "abstract": "We provide an estimator of the covariance matrix that achieves the optimal\nrate of convergence (up to constant factors) in the operator norm under two\nstandard notions of data contamination: We allow the adversary to corrupt an\n$\\eta$-fraction of the sample arbitrarily, while the distribution of the\nremaining data points only satisfies that the $L_{p}$-marginal moment with some\n$p \\ge 4$ is equivalent to the corresponding $L_2$-marginal moment. Despite\nrequiring the existence of only a few moments, our estimator achieves the same\ntail estimates as if the underlying distribution were Gaussian. As a part of\nour analysis, we prove a dimension-free Bai-Yin type theorem in the regime $p >\n4$.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an additive Gaussian process framework accounting for\nmonotonicity constraints and scalable to high dimensions. Our contributions are\nthreefold. First, we show that our framework enables to satisfy the constraints\neverywhere in the input space. We also show that more general componentwise\nlinear inequality constraints can be handled similarly, such as componentwise\nconvexity. Second, we propose the additive MaxMod algorithm for sequential\ndimension reduction. By sequentially maximizing a squared-norm criterion,\nMaxMod identifies the active input dimensions and refines the most important\nones. This criterion can be computed explicitly at a linear cost. Finally, we\nprovide open-source codes for our full framework. We demonstrate the\nperformance and scalability of the methodology in several synthetic examples\nwith hundreds of dimensions under monotonicity constraints as well as on a\nreal-world flood application.",
