    "abstract": "Human perception, memory and decision-making are impacted by tens of\ncognitive biases and heuristics that influence our actions and decisions.\nDespite the pervasiveness of such biases, they are generally not leveraged by\ntoday's Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that model human behavior and\ninteract with humans. In this theoretical paper, we claim that the future of\nhuman-machine collaboration will entail the development of AI systems that\nmodel, understand and possibly replicate human cognitive biases. We propose the\nneed for a research agenda on the interplay between human cognitive biases and\nArtificial Intelligence. We categorize existing cognitive biases from the\nperspective of AI systems, identify three broad areas of interest and outline\nresearch directions for the design of AI systems that have a better\nunderstanding of our own biases.",

    "abstract": "The impact performance of the wheel during wheel development must be ensured\nthrough a wheel impact test for vehicle safety. However, manufacturing and\ntesting a real wheel take a significant amount of time and money because\ndeveloping an optimal wheel design requires numerous iterative processes of\nmodifying the wheel design and verifying the safety performance. Accordingly,\nthe actual wheel impact test has been replaced by computer simulations, such as\nFinite Element Analysis (FEA), but it still requires high computational costs\nfor modeling and analysis. Moreover, FEA experts are needed. This study\npresents an aluminum road wheel impact performance prediction model based on\ndeep learning that replaces the computationally expensive and time-consuming 3D\nFEA. For this purpose, 2D disk-view wheel image data, 3D wheel voxel data, and\nbarrier mass value used for wheel impact test are utilized as the inputs to\npredict the magnitude of maximum von Mises stress, corresponding location, and\nthe stress distribution of 2D disk-view. The wheel impact performance\nprediction model can replace the impact test in the early wheel development\nstage by predicting the impact performance in real time and can be used without\ndomain knowledge. The time required for the wheel development process can be\nshortened through this mechanism.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores continuous-time control synthesis for target-driven\nnavigation to satisfy complex high-level tasks expressed as linear temporal\nlogic (LTL). We propose a model-free framework using deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) where the underlying dynamic system is unknown (an opaque box).\nUnlike prior work, this paper considers scenarios where the given LTL\nspecification might be infeasible and therefore cannot be accomplished\nglobally. Instead of modifying the given LTL formula, we provide a general\nDRL-based approach to satisfy it with minimal violation.\n%\\mminline{Need to decide if we're comfortable calling these \"guarantees\" due\nto the stochastic policy. I'm not repeating this comment everywhere that says\n\"guarantees\" but there are multiple places.}\nTo do this, we transform a previously multi-objective DRL problem, which\nrequires simultaneous automata satisfaction and minimum violation cost, into a\nsingle objective. By guiding the DRL agent with a sampling-based path planning\nalgorithm for the potentially infeasible LTL task, the proposed approach\nmitigates the myopic tendencies of DRL, which are often an issue when learning\ngeneral LTL tasks that can have long or infinite horizons. This is achieved by\ndecomposing an infeasible LTL formula into several reach-avoid sub-tasks with\nshorter horizons, which can be trained in a modular DRL architecture.\nFurthermore, we overcome the challenge of the exploration process for DRL in\ncomplex and cluttered environments by using path planners to design rewards\nthat are dense in the configuration space. The benefits of the presented\napproach are demonstrated through testing on various complex nonlinear systems\nand compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "Articulated objects pose a unique challenge for robotic perception and\nmanipulation. Their increased number of degrees-of-freedom makes tasks such as\nlocalization computationally difficult, while also making the process of\nreal-world dataset collection unscalable. With the aim of addressing these\nscalability issues, we propose Neural Articulated Radiance Fields (NARF22), a\npipeline which uses a fully-differentiable, configuration-parameterized Neural\nRadiance Field (NeRF) as a means of providing high quality renderings of\narticulated objects. NARF22 requires no explicit knowledge of the object\nstructure at inference time. We propose a two-stage parts-based training\nmechanism which allows the object rendering models to generalize well across\nthe configuration space even if the underlying training data has as few as one\nconfiguration represented. We demonstrate the efficacy of NARF22 by training\nconfigurable renderers on a real-world articulated tool dataset collected via a\nFetch mobile manipulation robot.

    "abstract": "Temporal graph is an abstraction for modeling dynamic systems that consist of\nevolving interaction elements. In this paper, we aim to solve an important yet\nneglected problem -- how to learn information from high-order neighbors in\ntemporal graphs? -- to enhance the informativeness and discriminativeness for\nthe learned node representations. We argue that when learning high-order\ninformation from temporal graphs, we encounter two challenges, i.e.,\ncomputational inefficiency and over-smoothing, that cannot be solved by\nconventional techniques applied on static graphs. To remedy these deficiencies,\nwe propose a temporal propagation-based graph neural network, namely TPGNN. To\nbe specific, the model consists of two distinct components, i.e., propagator\nand node-wise encoder. The propagator is leveraged to propagate messages from\nthe anchor node to its temporal neighbors within $k$-hop, and then\nsimultaneously update the state of neighborhoods, which enables efficient\ncomputation, especially for a deep model. In addition, to prevent\nover-smoothing, the model compels the messages from $n$-hop neighbors to update\nthe $n$-hop memory vector preserved on the anchor. The node-wise encoder adopts\ntransformer architecture to learn node representations by explicitly learning\nthe importance of memory vectors preserved on the node itself, that is,\nimplicitly modeling the importance of messages from neighbors at different\nlayers, thus mitigating the over-smoothing. Since the encoding process will not\nquery temporal neighbors, we can dramatically save time consumption in\ninference. Extensive experiments on temporal link prediction and node\nclassification demonstrate the superiority of TPGNN over state-of-the-art\nbaselines in efficiency and robustness.",

    "abstract": "A singularly (near) optimal distributed algorithm is one that is (near)\noptimal in \\emph{two} criteria, namely, its time and message complexities. For\n\\emph{synchronous} CONGEST networks, such algorithms are known for fundamental\ndistributed computing problems such as leader election [Kutten et al., JACM\n2015] and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) construction [Pandurangan et al., STOC\n2017, Elkin, PODC 2017]. However, it is open whether a singularly (near)\noptimal bound can be obtained for the MST construction problem in general\n\\emph{asynchronous} CONGEST networks.\nWe present a randomized distributed MST algorithm that, with high\nprobability, computes an MST in \\emph{asynchronous} CONGEST networks and takes\n$\\tilde{O}(D^{1+\\epsilon} + \\sqrt{n})$ time and $\\tilde{O}(m)$ messages, where\n$n$ is the number of nodes, $m$ the number of edges, $D$ is the diameter of the\nnetwork, and $\\epsilon >0$ is an arbitrarily small constant (both time and\nmessage bounds hold with high probability). Our algorithm is message optimal\n(up to a polylog$(n)$ factor) and almost time optimal (except for a\n$D^{\\epsilon}$ factor). Our result answers an open question raised in Mashregi\nand King [DISC 2019] by giving the first known asynchronous MST algorithm that\nhas sublinear time (for all $D = O(n^{1-\\epsilon})$) and uses $\\tilde{O}(m)$\nmessages. Using a result of Mashregi and King [DISC 2019], this also yields the\nfirst asynchronous MST algorithm that is sublinear in both time and messages in\nthe $KT_1$ CONGEST model.\nA key tool in our algorithm is the construction of a low diameter rooted\nspanning tree in asynchronous CONGEST that has depth\n$\\tilde{O}(D^{1+\\epsilon})$ (for an arbitrarily small constant $\\epsilon > 0$)\nin $\\tilde{O}(D^{1+\\epsilon})$ time and $\\tilde{O}(m)$ messages.

    "abstract": "Robots such as autonomous vehicles and assistive manipulators are\nincreasingly operating in dynamic environments and close physical proximity to\npeople. In such scenarios, the robot can leverage a human motion predictor to\npredict their future states and plan safe and efficient trajectories. However,\nno model is ever perfect -- when the observed human behavior deviates from the\nmodel predictions, the robot might plan unsafe maneuvers. Recent works have\nexplored maintaining a confidence parameter in the human model to overcome this\nchallenge, wherein the predicted human actions are tempered online based on the\nlikelihood of the observed human action under the prediction model. This has\nopened up a new research challenge, i.e., \\textit{how to compute the future\nhuman states online as the confidence parameter changes?} In this work, we\npropose a Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based approach to overcome this\nchallenge. Treating the confidence parameter as a virtual state in the system,\nwe compute a parameter-conditioned forward reachable tube (FRT) that provides\nthe future human states as a function of the confidence parameter. Online, as\nthe confidence parameter changes, we can simply query the corresponding FRT,\nand use it to update the robot plan. Computing parameter-conditioned FRT\ncorresponds to an (offline) high-dimensional reachability problem, which we\nsolve by leveraging recent advances in data-driven reachability analysis.\nOverall, our framework enables online maintenance and updates of safety\nassurances in human-robot interaction scenarios, even when the human prediction\nmodel is incorrect.

Our key insight is that a natural scene often\ncontains multiple constituents whose geometry, texture, and spatial\narrangements follow some clear patterns, but still exhibit rich variations over\ndifferent regions within the same scene. This suggests localizing the learning\nof a generative model on substantial local regions. Hence, we exploit a\nmulti-scale convolutional network, which possesses the spatial locality bias in\nnature, to learn from the statistics of local regions at multiple scales within\na single scene. In contrast to existing methods, our learning setup bypasses\nthe need to collect data from many homogeneous 3D scenes for learning common\nfeatures. We coin our method SinGRAV, for learning a Generative RAdiance Volume\nfrom a Single natural scene. We demonstrate the ability of SinGRAV in\ngenerating plausible and diverse variations from a single scene, the merits of\nSinGRAV over state-of-the-art generative neural scene methods, as well as the\nversatility of SinGRAV by its use in a variety of applications, spanning 3D\nscene editing, composition, and animation. Code and data will be released to\nfacilitate further research.",

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common\nprogressive neurological condition after Alzheimer's, characterized by motor\nand non-motor symptoms. Developing a method to diagnose the condition in its\nbeginning phases is essential because of the significant number of individuals\nafflicting with this illness. PD is typically identified using motor symptoms\nor other Neuroimaging techniques, such as DATSCAN and SPECT. These methods are\nexpensive, time-consuming, and unavailable to the general public; furthermore,\nthey are not very accurate. These constraints encouraged us to develop a novel\ntechnique using SHAP and Hard Voting Ensemble Method based on voice signals.\nMethods: In this article, we used Pearson Correlation Coefficients to\nunderstand the relationship between input features and the output, and finally,\ninput features with high correlation were selected. These selected features\nwere classified by the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient\nBoosting Machine (LightGBM), Gradient Boosting, and Bagging. Moreover, the Hard\nVoting Ensemble Method was determined based on the performance of the four\nclassifiers. At the final stage, we proposed Shapley Additive exPlanations\n(SHAP) to rank the features according to their significance in diagnosing\nParkinson's disease. Results and Conclusion: The proposed method achieved\n85.42% accuracy, 84.94% F1-score, 86.77% precision, 87.62% specificity, and\n83.20% sensitivity. The study's findings demonstrated that the proposed method\noutperformed state-of-the-art approaches and can assist physicians in\ndiagnosing Parkinson's cases.",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received substantial attention in recent\nyears due to their sparse and asynchronous communication nature, and thus can\nbe deployed in neuromorphic hardware and achieve extremely high energy\nefficiency. However, SNNs currently can hardly realize a comparable performance\nto that of artificial neural networks (ANNs) because their limited scalability\ndoes not allow for large-scale networks. Especially for Transformer, as a model\nof ANNs that has accomplished remarkable performance in various machine\nlearning tasks, its implementation in SNNs by conventional methods requires a\nlarge number of neurons, notably in the self-attention module. Inspired by the\nmechanisms in the nervous system, we propose an efficient spiking Transformer\n(EST) framework enabled by partial information to address the above problem. In\nthis model, we not only implemented the self-attention module with a reasonable\nnumber of neurons, but also introduced partial-information self-attention\n(PSA), which utilizes only partial input signals, further reducing\ncomputational resources compared to conventional methods. The experimental\nresults show that our EST can outperform the state-of-the-art SNN model in\nterms of accuracy and the number of time steps on both Cifar-10/100 and\nImageNet datasets. In particular, the proposed EST model achieves 78.48% top-1\naccuracy on the ImageNet dataset with only 16 time steps. In addition, our\nproposed PSA reduces flops by 49.8% with negligible performance loss compared\nto a self-attention module with full information.",

Closing the gap between\nreal-world physicality and immersive virtual experience requires a closed\ninteraction loop: applying user-exerted physical forces to the virtual\nenvironment and generating haptic sensations back to the users. However,\nexisting VR/AR solutions either completely ignore the force inputs from the\nusers or rely on obtrusive sensing devices that compromise user experience.\nBy identifying users' muscle activation patterns while engaging in VR/AR, we\ndesign a learning-based neural interface for natural and intuitive force\ninputs.

    "abstract": "This paper studies a distributed state estimation problem for both\ncontinuous- and discrete-time linear systems. A simply structured distributed\nestimator is first described for estimating the state of a continuous-time,\njointly observable, input free, multi-channel linear system whose sensed\noutputs are distributed across a fixed multi-agent network. The estimator is\nthen extended to non-stationary networks whose graphs switch according to a\nswitching signal with a fixed dwell time or a variable but with fixed average\ndwell time, or switch arbitrarily under appropriate assumptions. The estimator\nis guaranteed to solve the problem, provided a network-widely shared gain is\nsufficiently large. As an alternative to sharing a common gain across the\nnetwork, a fully distributed version of the estimator is thus studied in which\neach agent adaptively adjusts a local gain though the practicality of this\napproach is subject to a robustness issue common to adaptive control. A\ndiscrete-time version of the distributed state estimation problem is also\nstudied, and a corresponding estimator is proposed for time-varying networks.\nFor each scenario, it is explained how to construct the estimator so that its\nstate estimation errors all converge to zero exponentially fast at a fixed but\narbitrarily chosen rate, provided the network's graph is strongly connected for\nall time. This is accomplished by appealing to the ``split-spectrum'' approach\nand exploiting several well-known properties of invariant subspace. The\nproposed estimators are inherently resilient to abrupt changes in the number of\nagents and communication links in the inter-agent communication graph upon\nwhich the algorithms depend, provided the network is redundantly strongly\nconnected and redundantly jointly observable.",

    "abstract": "We study the paradigmatic spiked matrix model of principal components\nanalysis, where the rank-one signal is corrupted by additive noise. While the\nnoise is typically taken from a Wigner matrix with independent entries, here\nthe potential acting on the eigenvalues has a quadratic plus a quartic\ncomponent. The quartic term induces strong correlations between the matrix\nelements, which makes the setting relevant for applications but analytically\nchallenging. Our work provides the first characterization of the Bayes-optimal\nlimits for inference in this model with structured noise. If the signal prior\nis rotational-invariant, then we show that a spectral estimator is optimal. In\ncontrast, for more general priors, the existing approximate message passing\nalgorithm (AMP) falls short of achieving the information-theoretic limits, and\nwe provide a justification for this sub-optimality. Finally, by generalizing\nthe theory of Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equations, we cure the issue by\nproposing a novel AMP which matches the theoretical limits. Our\ninformation-theoretic analysis is based on the replica method, a powerful\nheuristic from statistical mechanics; instead, the novel AMP comes with a\nrigorous state evolution analysis tracking its performance in the\nhigh-dimensional limit. Even if we focus on a specific noise distribution, our\nmethodology can be generalized to a wide class of trace ensembles, at the cost\nof more involved expressions.",

    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of aligning pre-trained large language models (LMs)\nwith human preferences. If we view text generation as a sequential\ndecision-making problem, reinforcement learning (RL) appears to be a natural\nconceptual framework. However, using RL for LM-based generation faces empirical\nchallenges, including training instability due to the combinatorial action\nspace, as well as a lack of open-source libraries and benchmarks customized for\nLM alignment. Thus, a question rises in the research community: is RL a\npractical paradigm for NLP?\nTo help answer this, we first introduce an open-source modular library,\nRL4LMs (Reinforcement Learning for Language Models), for optimizing language\ngenerators with RL. The library consists of on-policy RL algorithms that can be\nused to train any encoder or encoder-decoder LM in the HuggingFace library\n(Wolf et al. 2020) with an arbitrary reward function. Next, we present the GRUE\n(General Reinforced-language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark, a set of 6\nlanguage generation tasks which are supervised not by target strings, but by\nreward functions which capture automated measures of human preference.GRUE is\nthe first leaderboard-style evaluation of RL algorithms for NLP tasks. Finally,\nwe introduce an easy-to-use, performant RL algorithm, NLPO (Natural Language\nPolicy Optimization)} that learns to effectively reduce the combinatorial\naction space in language generation. We show 1) that RL techniques are\ngenerally better than supervised methods at aligning LMs to human preferences;\nand 2) that NLPO exhibits greater stability and performance than previous\npolicy gradient methods (e.g., PPO (Schulman et al. 2017)), based on both\nautomatic and human evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Prior works on event-based optical flow estimation have investigated several\ngradient-based learning methods to train neural networks for predicting optical\nflow. However, they do not utilize the fast data rate of event data streams and\nrely on a spatio-temporal representation constructed from a collection of\nevents over a fixed period of time (often between two grayscale frames). As a\nresult, optical flow is only evaluated at a frequency much lower than the rate\ndata is produced by an event-based camera, leading to a temporally sparse\noptical flow estimation. To predict temporally dense optical flow, we cast the\nproblem as a sequential learning task and propose a training methodology to\ntrain sequential networks for continuous prediction on an event stream. We\npropose two types of networks: one focused on performance and another focused\non compute efficiency. We first train long-short term memory networks (LSTMs)\non the DSEC dataset and demonstrated 10x temporally dense optical flow\nestimation over existing flow estimation approaches. The additional benefit of\nhaving a memory to draw long temporal correlations back in time results in a\n19.7% improvement in flow prediction accuracy of LSTMs over similar networks\nwith no memory elements. We subsequently show that the inherent recurrence of\nspiking neural networks (SNNs) enables them to learn and estimate temporally\ndense optical flow with 31.8% lesser parameters than LSTM, but with a slightly\nincreased error. This demonstrates potential for energy-efficient\nimplementation of fast optical flow prediction using SNNs.",

However, a clear solution\nto the V/E issue remained elusive so far. In this manuscript a new architecture\nof NN is proposed, designed to mathematically prevent the V/E issue to occur.\nThe pursuit of approximate dynamical isometry, i.e. parameter configurations\nwhere the singular values of the input-output Jacobian are tightly distributed\naround 1, leads to the derivation of a NN's architecture that shares common\ntraits with the popular Residual Network model. Instead of skipping connections\nbetween layers, the idea is to filter the previous activations orthogonally and\nadd them to the nonlinear activations of the next layer, realising a convex\ncombination between them. Remarkably, the impossibility for the gradient\nupdates to either vanish or explode is demonstrated with analytical bounds that\nhold even in the infinite depth case. The effectiveness of this method is\nempirically proved by means of training via backpropagation an extremely deep\nmultilayer perceptron of 50k layers, and an Elman NN to learn long-term\ndependencies in the input of 10k time steps in the past. Compared with other\narchitectures specifically devised to deal with the V/E problem, e.g. LSTMs for\nrecurrent NNs, the proposed model is way simpler yet more effective.\nSurprisingly, a single layer vanilla RNN can be enhanced to reach state of the\nart performance, while converging super fast; for instance on the psMNIST task,\nit is possible to get test accuracy of over 94% in the first epoch, and over\n98% after just 10 epochs.",

This work extends the previously developed Spectral Ewald method for\nStokes flow to periodic boundary conditions in any number (three, two, one, or\nnone) of the spatial directions, in a unified framework. The periodic potential\nis split into a short-range and a long-range part, where the latter is treated\nin Fourier space using the fast Fourier transform. A crucial component of the\nmethod is the modified kernels used to treat singular integration. We derive\nnew modified kernels, and new improved truncation error estimates for the\nstokeslet and stresslet. An automated procedure for selecting parameters based\non a given error tolerance is designed and tested. Analytical formulas for\nvalidation in the doubly and singly periodic cases are presented. We show that\nthe computational time of the method scales like O(N log N) for N sources and\ntargets, and investigate how the time depends on the error tolerance and window\nfunction, i.e. the function used to smoothly spread irregular point data to a\nuniform grid. The method is fastest in the fully periodic case, while the run\ntime in the free-space case is around three times as large.

The approach utilizes\nRelative Entropy (RE) to choose the optimum impulse response estimate, optimum\ntime delay and optimum impulse response length. The desired RE is the\nKulback-Lielber divergence of the estimated distribution from its unknown true\ndistribution. A unique probabilistic validation approach estimates the desired\nrelative entropy and minimizes this criterion to provide the impulse response\nestimate. Classical methods have approached this system modeling problem from\ntwo separate angles for the time delay estimation and for the order selection.\nTime delay methods focus on time delay estimate minimizing various proposed\ncriteria, while the existing order selection approaches choose the optimum\nimpulse response length based on their proposed criteria. The strength of the\nproposed RE based method is in using the RE based criterion to estimate both\nthe time delay and impulse response length simultaneously. In addition,\nestimation of the noise variance, when the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is\nunknown is also concurrent and is based on optimizing the same RE based\ncriterion. The RE based approach is also extended for online impulse response\nestimations. The online method reduces the model estimation computational\ncomplexity upon the arrival of a new sample. The introduced efficient stopping\ncriteria for this online approaches is extremely valuable in practical\napplications.

Several approaches have been\nproposed to alleviate the computational burden of this nested-loop structure,\nbut these methods still suffer from high complexity when the state space is\neither discrete with large cardinality or continuous in high dimensions.

One option is to solve\nretrieval problems via a sequence of prehensile pick-n-place operations, which\ncan be computationally expensive to compute in highly-cluttered scenarios and\nalso inefficient to execute. The proposed framework selects the option of\nperforming non-prehensile actions, such as pushing, to clean a cluttered\nworkspace to allow a robotic arm to retrieve a target object. Non-prehensile\nactions, allow to interact simultaneously with multiple objects, which can\nspeed up execution.

    "abstract": "Keypoint detection serves as the basis for many computer vision and robotics\napplications. Despite the fact that colored point clouds can be readily\nobtained, most existing keypoint detectors extract only geometry-salient\nkeypoints, which can impede the overall performance of systems that intend to\n(or have the potential to) leverage color information. To promote advances in\nsuch systems, we propose an efficient multi-modal keypoint detector that can\nextract both geometry-salient and color-salient keypoints in colored point\nclouds. The proposed CEntroid Distance (CED) keypoint detector comprises an\nintuitive and effective saliency measure, the centroid distance, that can be\nused in both 3D space and color space, and a multi-modal non-maximum\nsuppression algorithm that can select keypoints with high saliency in two or\nmore modalities. The proposed saliency measure leverages directly the\ndistribution of points in a local neighborhood and does not require normal\nestimation or eigenvalue decomposition. We evaluate the proposed method in\nterms of repeatability and computational efficiency (i.e. running time) against\nstate-of-the-art keypoint detectors on both synthetic and real-world datasets.\nResults demonstrate that our proposed CED keypoint detector requires minimal\ncomputational time while attaining high repeatability. To showcase one of the\npotential applications of the proposed method, we further investigate the task\nof colored point cloud registration. Results suggest that our proposed CED\ndetector outperforms state-of-the-art handcrafted and learning-based keypoint\ndetectors in the evaluated scenes. The C++ implementation of the proposed\nmethod is made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/UCR-Robotics/CED_Detector.",

For example, in\ndetecting cows from natural images, the shape of the head is a semantic and\nbecause images of cows often have grass backgrounds but only in certain\nsettings, the background is a nuisance. Relationships between a nuisance and\nthe label are unstable across settings and, consequently, models that exploit\nnuisance-label relationships face performance degradation when these\nrelationships change. Direct knowledge of a nuisance helps build models that\nare robust to such changes, but knowledge of a nuisance requires extra\nannotations beyond the label and the covariates.

In this paper, a novel systematic beam control scheme\nis presented to tackle the beam management problem which is difficult due to\nthe nonconvex objective function. We employ double deep Q-network (DDQN) under\na federated learning (FL) framework to address the above optimization problem,\nand thereby fulfilling adaptive and intelligent beam management in UDmmN.

In our approach, the fractional viscoelasticity is\naccounted through canonical combinations of Scott-Blair elements to construct a\nseries of well-known fractional linear viscoelastic models, such as\nKelvin-Voigt, Maxwell, Kelvin-Zener and Poynting-Thomson. We also consider a\nfractional quasi-linear version of Fung's model to account for stress/strain\nnonlinearity. The fractional viscoelastic models are combined with a fractional\nvisco-plastic device, coupled with fractional viscoelastic models involving\nserial combinations of Scott-Blair elements. We then develop a general\nreturn-mapping procedure, which is fully implicit for linear viscoelastic\nmodels, and semi-implicit for the quasi-linear case. We find that, in the\ncorrection phase, the discrete stress projection and plastic slip have the same\nform for all the considered models, although with different property and\ntime-step dependent projection terms. A series of numerical experiments is\ncarried out with analytical and reference solutions to demonstrate the\nconvergence and computational cost of the proposed framework, which is shown to\nbe at least first-order accurate for general loading conditions.

Thanks to the\nMNF formulation, agents can contribute to each other's coordination via partial\nand/or total associations, contrary to traditional decentralized navigation\nfunctions (DNFs). In particular, agents may stimulate each other via their\nMNFs. Moreover, MNFs need to be confined which is a weaker condition compared\nto the Morse condition of DNFs. An MNF is composed of a confined function and\nan attraction kernel. The critical points of the former can be confined in a\nsafe region around a target critical point. The collision-free trajectory of an\nagent and its associations to its peers are governed by a confined function\nbefore reaching its safe region. Then, the attraction kernel drives the agent\nto its target in the safe region. MNFs provide faster coordination compared to\nDNFs. We illustrate how MNFs may exhibit some social behaviors in the course of\npartial and total associations among agents. Our simulations verify the\nefficiency of MNFs to coordinate complex swarms of agents.",

We demonstrate our approach on several compliance minimization\nproblems with volume fraction constraints, where support volume minimization is\nadded as an additional criterion to the objective function.

This paper focuses on studying the privacy-preserving\ntree boosting algorithms under the vertical FL. The existing solutions based on\ncryptography involve heavy computation and communication overhead and are\nvulnerable to inference attacks. Although the solution based on Local\nDifferential Privacy (LDP) addresses the above problems, it leads to the low\naccuracy of the trained model.\nThis paper explores to improve the accuracy of the widely deployed tree\nboosting algorithms satisfying differential privacy under vertical FL.\nSpecifically, we introduce a framework called OpBoost.

The first decade of the\nnew millennium has seen several new world-changing businesses spring to life\n(e.g., Google and Twitter), that have put connected data at the center of their\ntrade. Harnessing such data requires significant effort and expertise, and it\nquickly becomes prohibitively expensive. One solution involves building\ngraph-based data models, which is a challenging problem. In many applications,\nthe utilized software is managing not just objects as well as isolated and\ndiscrete data items but also the connections between them. Data semantics is a\nkey ingredient to construct a model that explicitly describes the relationships\nbetween data objects. In this paper, we claim that current ad hoc graphs that\nattempt to provide semantics to data structures (e.g., relational tables and\ntabular SQL) are problematic. These graphs mix static abstract concepts with\ndynamic specification of objects (particulars). Such a claim is supported by\nanalysis that applies the thinging machine (TM) model to provide diagrammatic\nrepresentations of data (e.g., Neo4J graphs). The study s results show that to\ntake advantage of graph algorithms and simultaneously achieve appropriate data\nsemantics, the data graphs should be developed as simplified forms of TM.",

    "abstract": "Humans tend to decompose a sentence into different parts like \\textsc{sth do\nsth at someplace} and then fill each part with certain content. Inspired by\nthis, we follow the \\textit{principle of modular design} to propose a novel\nimage captioner: learning to Collocate Visual-Linguistic Neural Modules\n(CVLNM). Unlike the \\re{widely used} neural module networks in VQA, where the\nlanguage (\\ie, question) is fully observable, \\re{the task of collocating\nvisual-linguistic modules is more challenging.} This is because the language is\nonly partially observable, for which we need to dynamically collocate the\nmodules during the process of image captioning. To sum up, we make the\nfollowing technical contributions to design and train our CVLNM: 1)\n\\textit{distinguishable module design} -- \\re{four modules in the encoder}\nincluding one linguistic module for function words and three visual modules for\ndifferent content words (\\ie, noun, adjective, and verb) and another linguistic\none in the decoder for commonsense reasoning, 2) a self-attention based\n\\textit{module controller} for robustifying the visual reasoning, 3) a\npart-of-speech based \\textit{syntax loss} imposed on the module controller for\nfurther regularizing the training of our CVLNM. Extensive experiments on the\nMS-COCO dataset show that our CVLNM is more effective, \\eg, achieving a new\nstate-of-the-art 129.5 CIDEr-D, and more robust, \\eg, being less likely to\noverfit to dataset bias and suffering less when fewer training samples are\navailable.

In this paper, we\npresent a safe method to learn a visuo-tactile insertion policy that is robust\nagainst grasp pose variations while minimizing human inputs and collision\nbetween the robot and the environment. We achieve this by dividing the\ninsertion task into two phases. In the first align phase, we learn a\ntactile-based grasp pose estimation model to align the insertion part with the\nreceptacle. In the second insert phase, we learn a vision-based policy to guide\nthe part into the receptacle. Using force-torque sensing, we also develop a\nsafe self-supervised data collection pipeline that limits collision between the\npart and the surrounding environment. Physical experiments on the USB insertion\ntask from the NIST Assembly Taskboard suggest that our approach can achieve\n45/45 insertion successes on 45 different initial grasp poses, improving on two\nbaselines: (1) a behavior cloning agent trained on 50 human insertion\ndemonstrations (1/45) and (2) an online RL policy (TD3) trained in real (0/45).",

    "abstract": "Traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have a fixed, finite number of\nmemory cells. In theory (assuming bounded range and precision), this limits\ntheir formal language recognition power to regular languages, and in practice,\nRNNs have been shown to be unable to learn many context-free languages (CFLs).\nIn order to expand the class of languages RNNs recognize, prior work has\naugmented RNNs with a nondeterministic stack data structure, putting them on\npar with pushdown automata and increasing their language recognition power to\nCFLs. Nondeterminism is needed for recognizing all CFLs (not just deterministic\nCFLs), but in this paper, we show that nondeterminism and the neural controller\ninteract to produce two more unexpected abilities. First, the nondeterministic\nstack RNN can recognize not only CFLs, but also many non-context-free\nlanguages. Second, it can recognize languages with much larger alphabet sizes\nthan one might expect given the size of its stack alphabet. Finally, to\nincrease the information capacity in the stack and allow it to solve more\ncomplicated tasks with large alphabet sizes, we propose a new version of the\nnondeterministic stack that simulates stacks of vectors rather than discrete\nsymbols. We demonstrate perplexity improvements with this new model on the Penn\nTreebank language modeling benchmark.",

    "abstract": "3D human reconstruction from RGB images achieves decent results in good\nweather conditions but degrades dramatically in rough weather. Complementary,\nmmWave radars have been employed to reconstruct 3D human joints and meshes in\nrough weather. However, combining RGB and mmWave signals for robust all-weather\n3D human reconstruction is still an open challenge, given the sparse nature of\nmmWave and the vulnerability of RGB images. In this paper, we present\nImmFusion, the first mmWave-RGB fusion solution to reconstruct 3D human bodies\nin all weather conditions robustly. Specifically, our ImmFusion consists of\nimage and point backbones for token feature extraction and a Transformer module\nfor token fusion. The image and point backbones refine global and local\nfeatures from original data, and the Fusion Transformer Module aims for\neffective information fusion of two modalities by dynamically selecting\ninformative tokens. Extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset, mmBody,\ncaptured in various environments demonstrate that ImmFusion can efficiently\nutilize the information of two modalities to achieve a robust 3D human body\nreconstruction in all weather conditions.

We argue that discriminative boundaries are\ncounter-intuitive as they define semantics by what-they-are-not; and should be\nreplaced by generative classifiers which define semantics by what-they-are.\nUnfortunately, generative classifiers are significantly less accurate. This may\nbe caused by the tendency of generative models to focus on easy to model\nsemantic generative factors and ignore non-semantic factors that are important\nbut difficult to model. We propose a new generative model in which semantic\nfactors are accommodated by shell theory's hierarchical generative process and\nnon-semantic factors by an instance specific noise term. We use the model to\ndevelop a classification scheme which suppresses the impact of noise while\npreserving semantic cues. The result is a surprisingly accurate generative\nclassifier, that takes the form of a modified nearest-neighbor algorithm; we\nterm it distance classification.

    "abstract": "Layer-wise distillation is a powerful tool to compress large models (i.e.\nteacher models) into small ones (i.e., student models). The student distills\nknowledge from the teacher by mimicking the hidden representations of the\nteacher at every intermediate layer. However, layer-wise distillation is\ndifficult. Since the student has a smaller model capacity than the teacher, it\nis often under-fitted. Furthermore, the hidden representations of the teacher\ncontain redundant information that the student does not necessarily need for\nthe target task's learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nTask-aware layEr-wise Distillation (TED).

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks are known to be brittle to even minor distribution\nshifts compared to the training distribution. While one line of work has\ndemonstrated that Simplicity Bias (SB) of DNNs - bias towards learning only the\nsimplest features - is a key reason for this brittleness, another recent line\nof work has surprisingly found that diverse/ complex features are indeed\nlearned by the backbone, and their brittleness is due to the linear\nclassification head relying primarily on the simplest features. To bridge the\ngap between these two lines of work, we first hypothesize and verify that while\nSB may not altogether preclude learning complex features, it amplifies simpler\nfeatures over complex ones. Namely, simple features are replicated several\ntimes in the learned representations while complex features might not be\nreplicated. This phenomenon, we term Feature Replication Hypothesis, coupled\nwith the Implicit Bias of SGD to converge to maximum margin solutions in the\nfeature space, leads the models to rely mostly on the simple features for\nclassification. To mitigate this bias, we propose Feature Reconstruction\nRegularizer (FRR) to ensure that the learned features can be reconstructed back\nfrom the logits. The use of {\\em FRR} in linear layer training (FRR-L)\nencourages the use of more diverse features for classification. We further\npropose to finetune the full network by freezing the weights of the linear\nlayer trained using FRR-L, to refine the learned features, making them more\nsuitable for classification. Using this simple solution, we demonstrate up to\n15% gains in OOD accuracy on the recently introduced semi-synthetic datasets\nwith extreme distribution shifts.

    "title": "RAP: Risk-Aware Prediction for Robust Planning",
    "abstract": "Robust planning in interactive scenarios requires predicting the uncertain\nfuture to make risk-aware decisions. Unfortunately, due to long-tail\nsafety-critical events, the risk is often under-estimated by finite-sampling\napproximations of probabilistic motion forecasts. This can lead to\noverconfident and unsafe robot behavior, even with robust planners. Instead of\nassuming full prediction coverage that robust planners require, we propose to\nmake prediction itself risk-aware. We introduce a new prediction objective to\nlearn a risk-biased distribution over trajectories, so that risk evaluation\nsimplifies to an expected cost estimation under this biased distribution. This\nreduces the sample complexity of the risk estimation during online planning,\nwhich is needed for safe real-time performance. Evaluation results in a\ndidactic simulation environment and on a real-world dataset demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled everyday technologies could help address\nage-related challenges like physical impairments and cognitive decline. While\nrecent research studied older adults' experiences with specific AI-enabled\nproducts (e.g., conversational agents and assistive robots), it remains unknown\nhow older adults perceive and experience current AI-enabled everyday\ntechnologies in general, which could impact their adoption of future AI-enabled\nproducts. We conducted a survey study (N=41) and semi-structured interviews\n(N=15) with older adults to understand their experiences and perceptions of AI.\nWe found that older adults were enthusiastic about learning and using\nAI-enabled products, but they lacked learning avenues. Additionally, they\nworried when AI-enabled products outwitted their expectations, intruded on\ntheir privacy, or impacted their decision-making skills. Therefore, they held\nmixed views towards AI-enabled products such as AI, an aid, or an adversary. We\nconclude with design recommendations that make older adults feel inclusive,\nsecure, and in control of their interactions with AI-enabled products.",

    "title": "Towards Flexible Inductive Bias via Progressive Reparameterization  Scheduling",
    "abstract": "There are two de facto standard architectures in recent computer vision:\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Strong\ninductive biases of convolutions help the model learn sample effectively, but\nsuch strong biases also limit the upper bound of CNNs when sufficient data are\navailable. On the contrary, ViT is inferior to CNNs for small data but superior\nfor sufficient data. Recent approaches attempt to combine the strengths of\nthese two architectures. However, we show these approaches overlook that the\noptimal inductive bias also changes according to the target data scale changes\nby comparing various models' accuracy on subsets of sampled ImageNet at\ndifferent ratios. In addition, through Fourier analysis of feature maps, the\nmodel's response patterns according to signal frequency changes, we observe\nwhich inductive bias is advantageous for each data scale. The more\nconvolution-like inductive bias is included in the model, the smaller the data\nscale is required where the ViT-like model outperforms the ResNet performance.\nTo obtain a model with flexible inductive bias on the data scale, we show\nreparameterization can interpolate inductive bias between convolution and\nself-attention. By adjusting the number of epochs the model stays in the\nconvolution, we show that reparameterization from convolution to self-attention\ninterpolates the Fourier analysis pattern between CNNs and ViTs. Adapting these\nfindings, we propose Progressive Reparameterization Scheduling (PRS), in which\nreparameterization adjusts the required amount of convolution-like or\nself-attention-like inductive bias per layer. For small-scale datasets, our PRS\nperforms reparameterization from convolution to self-attention linearly faster\nat the late stage layer. PRS outperformed previous studies on the small-scale\ndataset, e.g., CIFAR-100.",

Moreover, to further reduce the memory, we introduce a\nlighter dense retriever (LITE) which is jointly trained on contrastive learning\nand knowledge distillation from DrBoost. Compared to previous heavy hybrid\nretrievers, our Hybrid-LITE retriever saves 13 memory while maintaining 98.0\nperformance.\nIn addition, we study the generalization of light hybrid retrievers along two\ndimensions, out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and robustness against\nadversarial attacks. We evaluate models on two existing OOD benchmarks and\ncreate six adversarial attack sets for robustness evaluation. Experiments show\nthat our light hybrid retrievers achieve better robustness performance than\nboth sparse and dense retrievers.

    "abstract": "The problem of safely learning and controlling a dynamical system - i.e., of\nstabilizing an originally (partially) unknown system while ensuring that it\ndoes not leave a prescribed 'safe set' - has recently received tremendous\nattention in the controls community. Further complexities arise, however, when\nthe structure of the safe set itself depends on the unknown part of the\nsystem's dynamics. In particular, a popular approach based on control Lyapunov\nfunctions (CLF), control barrier functions (CBF) and Gaussian processes (to\nbuild confidence set around the unknown term), which has proved successful in\nthe known-safe set setting, becomes inefficient as-is, due to the introduction\nof higher-order terms to be estimated and bounded with high probability using\nonly system state measurements. In this paper, we build on the recent\nliterature on GPs and reproducing kernels to perform this latter task, and show\nhow to correspondingly modify the CLF-CBF-based approach to obtain safety\nguarantees. Namely, we derive exponential CLF and second relative order\nexponential CBF constraints whose satisfaction guarantees stability and forward\nin-variance of the partially unknown safe set with high probability. To\novercome the intractability of verification of these conditions on the\ncontinuous domain, we apply discretization of the state space and use Lipschitz\ncontinuity properties of dynamics to derive equivalent CLF and CBF certificates\nin discrete state space. Finally, we present an algorithm for the control\ndesign aim using the derived certificates.",

    "abstract": "Visual imitation learning provides an effective framework to learn skills\nfrom demonstrations. However, the quality of the provided demonstrations\nusually significantly affects the ability of an agent to acquire desired\nskills. Therefore, the standard visual imitation learning assumes near-optimal\ndemonstrations, which are expensive or sometimes prohibitive to collect.\nPrevious works propose to learn from noisy demonstrations; however, the noise\nis usually assumed to follow a context-independent distribution such as a\nuniform or gaussian distribution. In this paper, we consider another crucial\nyet underexplored setting -- imitation learning with task-irrelevant yet\nlocally consistent segments in the demonstrations (e.g., wiping sweat while\ncutting potatoes in a cooking tutorial). We argue that such noise is common in\nreal world data and term them \"extraneous\" segments. To tackle this problem, we\nintroduce Extraneousness-Aware Imitation Learning (EIL), a self-supervised\napproach that learns visuomotor policies from third-person demonstrations with\nextraneous subsequences. EIL learns action-conditioned observation embeddings\nin a self-supervised manner and retrieves task-relevant observations across\nvisual demonstrations while excluding the extraneous ones. Experimental results\nshow that EIL outperforms strong baselines and achieves comparable policies to\nthose trained with perfect demonstration on both simulated and real-world robot\ncontrol tasks.

    "abstract": "Optimizing strategic decisions (a.k.a. computing equilibrium) is key to the\nsuccess of many non-cooperative multi-agent applications. However, in many\nreal-world situations, we may face the exact opposite of this game-theoretic\nproblem -- instead of prescribing equilibrium of a given game, we may directly\nobserve the agents' equilibrium behaviors but want to infer the underlying\nparameters of an unknown game. This research question, also known as inverse\ngame theory, has been studied in multiple recent works in the context of\nStackelberg games. Unfortunately, existing works exhibit quite negative\nresults, showing statistical hardness and computational hardness, assuming\nfollower's perfectly rational behaviors. Our work relaxes the perfect\nrationality agent assumption to the classic quantal response model, a more\nrealistic behavior model of bounded rationality. Interestingly, we show that\nthe smooth property brought by such bounded rationality model actually leads to\nprovably more efficient learning of the follower utility parameters in general\nStackelberg games. Systematic empirical experiments on synthesized games\nconfirm our theoretical results and further suggest its robustness beyond the\nstrict quantal response model.",

Our\nfirst key insight is that MultiTask Learning (MTL) and hardware-aware Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS) can work in synergy to greatly benefit on-device\nDense Predictions (DP). Empirical results reveal that the joint learning of the\ntwo paradigms is surprisingly effective at improving DP accuracy, achieving\nsuperior performance over both the transfer learning of single-task NAS and\nprior state-of-the-art approaches in MTL, all with just 1/10th of the\ncomputation. To the best of our knowledge, our framework, named EDNAS, is the\nfirst to successfully leverage the synergistic relationship of NAS and MTL for\nDP. Our second key insight is that the standard depth training for multi-task\nDP can cause significant instability and noise to MTL evaluation.

Recently, there\nis a trend of leveraging multiple sources of input data, such as complementing\nthe 3D point cloud with 2D images that often have richer color and fewer\nnoises. However, due to the heterogeneous geometrics of the 2D and 3D\nrepresentations, it prevents us from applying off-the-shelf neural networks to\nachieve multimodal fusion. To that end, we propose Bridged Transformer (BrT),\nan end-to-end architecture for 3D object detection. BrT is simple and\neffective, which learns to identify 3D and 2D object bounding boxes from both\npoints and image patches. A key element of BrT lies in the utilization of\nobject queries for bridging 3D and 2D spaces, which unifies different sources\nof data representations in Transformer. We adopt a form of feature aggregation\nrealized by point-to-patch projections which further strengthen the\ncorrelations between images and points.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of data generated from Internet of Things (IoTs) such as\nsmart phones and smart home devices presents new challenges to cloud computing\nin transferring, storing, and processing the data. With increasingly more\npowerful edge devices, edge computing, on the other hand, has the potential to\nbetter responsiveness, privacy, and cost efficiency. However, resources across\nthe cloud and edge are highly distributed and highly diverse. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes EdgeFaaS, a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) based\ncomputing framework that supports the flexible, convenient, and optimized use\nof distributed and heterogeneous resources across IoT, edge, and cloud systems.\nEdgeFaaS allows cluster resources and individual devices to be managed under\nthe same framework and provide computational and storage resources for\nfunctions. It provides virtual function and virtual storage interfaces for\nconsistent function management and storage management across heterogeneous\ncompute and storage resources. It automatically optimizes the scheduling of\nfunctions and placement of data according to their performance and privacy\nrequirements. EdgeFaaS is evaluated based on two edge workflows: video\nanalytics workflow and federated learning workflow, both of which are\nrepresentative edge applications and involve large amounts of input data\ngenerated from edge devices.",

    "abstract": "We present SLOT-V, a novel supervised learning framework that learns observer\nmodels (human preferences) from robot motion trajectories in a legibility\ncontext. Legibility measures how easily a (human) observer can infer the\nrobot's goal from a robot motion trajectory. When generating such trajectories,\nexisting planners often rely on an observer model that estimates the quality of\ntrajectory candidates. These observer models are frequently hand-crafted or,\noccasionally, learned from demonstrations. Here, we propose to learn them in a\nsupervised manner using the same data format that is frequently used during the\nevaluation of aforementioned approaches. We then demonstrate the generality of\nSLOT-V using a Franka Emika in a simulated manipulation environment. For this,\nwe show that it can learn to closely predict various hand-crafted observer\nmodels, i.e., that SLOT-V's hypothesis space encompasses existing handcrafted\nmodels. Next, we showcase SLOT-V's ability to generalize by showing that a\ntrained model continues to perform well in environments with unseen goal\nconfigurations and/or goal counts. Finally, we benchmark SLOT-V's sample\nefficiency (and performance) against an existing IRL approach and show that\nSLOT-V learns better observer models with less data. Combined, these results\nsuggest that SLOT-V can learn viable observer models. Better observer models\nimply more legible trajectories, which may - in turn - lead to better and more\ntransparent human-robot interaction.",

While no model can work when\ndata evolves in an arbitrary fashion, if there is some pattern to these\nchanges, we might be able to design methods to address it. This paper addresses\nsituations when data evolves gradually. We introduce a novel time-varying\nimportance weight estimator that can detect gradual shifts in the distribution\nof data. Such an importance weight estimator allows the training method to\nselectively sample past data -- not just similar data from the past like a\nstandard importance weight estimator would but also data that evolved in a\nsimilar fashion in the past. Our time-varying importance weight is quite\ngeneral. We demonstrate different ways of implementing it that exploit some\nknown structure in the evolution of data. We demonstrate and evaluate this\napproach on a variety of problems ranging from supervised learning tasks\n(multiple image classification datasets) where the data undergoes a sequence of\ngradual shifts of our design to reinforcement learning tasks (robotic\nmanipulation and continuous control) where data undergoes a shift organically\nas the policy or the task changes.",

    "abstract": "The recent prevalence of pretrained language models (PLMs) has dramatically\nshifted the paradigm of semantic parsing, where the mapping from natural\nlanguage utterances to structured logical forms is now formulated as a Seq2Seq\ntask. Despite the promising performance, previous PLM-based approaches often\nsuffer from hallucination problems due to their negligence of the structural\ninformation contained in the sentence, which essentially constitutes the key\nsemantics of the logical forms. Furthermore, most works treat PLM as a black\nbox in which the generation process of the target logical form is hidden\nbeneath the decoder modules, which greatly hinders the model's intrinsic\ninterpretability. To address these two issues, we propose to incorporate the\ncurrent PLMs with a hierarchical decoder network. By taking the first-principle\nstructures as the semantic anchors, we propose two novel intermediate\nsupervision tasks, namely Semantic Anchor Extraction and Semantic Anchor\nAlignment, for training the hierarchical decoders and probing the model\nintermediate representations in a self-adaptive manner alongside the\nfine-tuning process. We conduct intensive experiments on several semantic\nparsing benchmarks and demonstrate that our approach can consistently\noutperform the baselines.

    "abstract": "In many complex sequential decision making tasks, online planning is crucial\nfor high-performance. For efficient online planning, Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS) employs a principled mechanism for trading off between exploration and\nexploitation. MCTS outperforms comparison methods in various discrete decision\nmaking domains such as Go, Chess, and Shogi. Following, extensions of MCTS to\ncontinuous domains have been proposed. However, the inherent high branching\nfactor and the resulting explosion of search tree size is limiting existing\nmethods.

CMCGS takes advantage of\nthe insight that, during planning, sharing the same action policy between\nseveral states can yield high performance. To implement this idea, at each time\nstep CMCGS clusters similar states into a limited number of stochastic action\nbandit nodes, which produce a layered graph instead of an MCTS search tree.\nExperimental evaluation with limited sample budgets shows that CMCGS\noutperforms comparison methods in several complex continuous DeepMind Control\nSuite benchmarks and a 2D navigation task.",

To lower computational cost,\nexisting works generally limit self-attention computation within\nnon-overlapping windows. However, each group of tokens are always from a dense\narea of the image. This is considered as a dense attention strategy since the\ninteractions of tokens are restrained in dense regions. Obviously, this\nstrategy could result in restricted receptive fields. To address this issue, we\npropose Attention Retractable Transformer (ART) for image restoration, which\npresents both dense and sparse attention modules in the network.

Furthermore, the alternating application of dense and\nsparse attention modules greatly enhances representation ability of Transformer\nwhile providing retractable attention on the input image.We conduct extensive\nexperiments on image super-resolution, denoising, and JPEG compression artifact\nreduction tasks.

    "abstract": "We propose a non-learning depth completion method for a sparse depth map\ncaptured using a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor guided by a pair of\nstereo images. Generally, conventional stereo-aided depth completion methods\nhave two limiations. (i) They assume the given sparse depth map is accurately\naligned to the input image, whereas the alignment is difficult to achieve in\npractice. (ii) They have limited accuracy in the long range because the depth\nis estimated by pixel disparity. To solve the abovementioned limitations, we\npropose selective stereo matching (SSM) that searches the most appropriate\ndepth value for each image pixel from its neighborly projected LiDAR points\nbased on an energy minimization framework. This depth selection approach can\nhandle any type of mis-projection. Moreover, SSM has an advantage in terms of\nlong-range depth accuracy because it directly uses the LiDAR measurement rather\nthan the depth acquired from the stereo. SSM is a discrete process; thus, we\napply variational smoothing with binary anisotropic diffusion tensor (B-ADT) to\ngenerate a continuous depth map while preserving depth discontinuity across\nobject boundaries. Experimentally, compared with the previous state-of-the-art\nstereo-aided depth completion, the proposed method reduced the mean absolute\nerror (MAE) of the depth estimation to 0.65 times and demonstrated\napproximately twice more accurate estimation in the long range. Moreover, under\nvarious LiDAR-camera calibration errors, the proposed method reduced the depth\nestimation MAE to 0.34-0.93 times from previous depth completion methods.",

However, federated\nlearning systems are vulnerable to Byzantine attacks from malicious\nparticipants, who can upload carefully crafted local model updates to degrade\nthe quality of the global model and even leave a backdoor. While this problem\nhas received significant attention recently, current defensive schemes heavily\nrely on various assumptions, such as a fixed Byzantine model, availability of\nparticipants' local data, minority attackers, IID data distribution, etc.\nTo relax those constraints, this paper presents Robust-FL, the first\nprediction-based Byzantine-robust federated learning scheme where none of the\nassumptions is leveraged. The core idea of the Robust-FL is exploiting\nhistorical global model to construct an estimator based on which the local\nmodels will be filtered through similarity detection. We then cluster local\nmodels to adaptively adjust the acceptable differences between the local models\nand the estimator such that Byzantine users can be identified.

First, the lack of labeled samples makes the\nlearned model easy to overfit. Second, it also suffers from high intra-class\nvariance and low inter-class difference in the datasets. To address this\nchallenging task, we propose a two-stage background suppression and foreground\nalignment framework, which is composed of a background activation suppression\n(BAS) module, a foreground object alignment (FOA) module, and a local to local\n(L2L) similarity metric.

What's more, considering the lack of labeled\nsamples, we compute the pairwise similarity of feature maps using both the raw\nimage and the refined image. The FOA then reconstructs the feature map of each\nsupport sample according to its correction to the query ones, which addresses\nthe problem of misalignment between support-query image pairs. To enable the\nproposed method to have the ability to capture subtle differences in confused\nsamples, we present a novel L2L similarity metric to further measure the local\nsimilarity between a pair of aligned spatial features in the embedding space.\nExtensive experiments conducted on multiple popular fine-grained benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art by a\nlarge margin.",

    "abstract": "With the recent advances in mobile energy storage technologies, electric\nvehicles (EVs) have become a crucial part of smart grids. When EVs participate\nin the demand response program, the charging cost can be significantly reduced\nby taking full advantage of the real-time pricing signals. However, many\nstochastic factors exist in the dynamic environment, bringing significant\nchallenges to design an optimal charging/discharging control strategy. This\npaper develops an optimal EV charging/discharging control strategy for\ndifferent EV users under dynamic environments to maximize EV users' benefits.\nWe first formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then we\nconsider EV users with different behaviors as agents in different environments.\nFurthermore, a horizontal federated reinforcement learning (HFRL)-based method\nis proposed to fit various users' behaviors and dynamic environments. This\napproach can learn an optimal charging/discharging control strategy without\nsharing users' profiles. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed\nreal-time EV charging/discharging control strategy can perform well among\nvarious stochastic factors.",

In this paper, we consider the task of long-term\nlocalization in a changing indoor environment given sparse CAD floor plans. The\ncommonly used pre-built maps from the robot sensors may increase the cost and\ntime of deployment. Furthermore, their detailed nature requires that they are\nupdated when significant changes occur. We address the difficulty of\nlocalization when the correspondence between the map and the observations is\nlow due to the sparsity of the CAD map and the changing environment. To\novercome both challenges, we propose to exploit semantic cues that are commonly\npresent in human-oriented spaces. These semantic cues can be detected using RGB\ncameras by utilizing object detection, and are matched against an\neasy-to-update, abstract semantic map. The semantic information is integrated\ninto a Monte Carlo localization framework using a particle filter that operates\non 2D LiDAR scans and camera data.

Auto-tuning is\nparticularly useful for GPU programming, as a single kernel requires re-tuning\nafter code changes, for different input data, and for different architectures.\nHowever, the discrete, and non-convex nature of the search space creates a\nchallenging optimization problem.

    "abstract": "Existing permissioned blockchains often rely on coordination-based consensus\nprotocols to ensure the safe execution of applications in a Byzantine\nenvironment. Furthermore, these protocols serialize the transactions by\nordering them into a total global order. The serializability preserves the\ncorrectness of the application's state stored on the blockchain. However, using\ncoordination-based protocols to attain the global order of transactions can\nlimit the throughput and induce high latency. In contrast, application-level\ncorrectness requirements exist that are not dependent on the order of\ntransactions, known as invariant-confluence (I-confluence). The I-confluent\napplications can execute in a coordination-free manner benefiting from the\nimproved performance compared to the coordination-based approaches. The safety\nand liveness of I-confluent applications are studied in non-Byzantine\nenvironments, but the correct execution of such applications remains a\nchallenge in Byzantine coordination-free environments. This work introduces\nOrderlessChain, a coordination-free permissioned blockchain for the safe and\nlive execution of I-confluent applications in a Byzantine environment.

In order to\neffectively collaborate with humans and ensure safety, AI systems need to be\nable to understand, interpret and predict human moral judgments and decisions.\nHuman moral judgments are often guided by rules, but not always. A central\nchallenge for AI safety is capturing the flexibility of the human moral mind --\nthe ability to determine when a rule should be broken, especially in novel or\nunusual situations. In this paper, we present a novel challenge set consisting\nof rule-breaking question answering (RBQA) of cases that involve potentially\npermissible rule-breaking -- inspired by recent moral psychology studies.

Considering the large proportion of the\nbackground in the 3D feature space, we introduce a projection strategy to\nproject the 3D features into three orthogonal 2D planes to capture the\ncontextual attention from different views. In this way, we can filter out the\nredundant feature information and mitigate the loss of critical information for\nsmall lesions in 3D scans.

However,\nthere are several limitations of current telepresence robots, such as the high\nweight, complexity of the system that prevents its fast deployment, and the\nlimited workspace of the avatars mounted on either static or wheeled mobile\nplatforms.\nIn this paper, we present a novel concept of telecommunication through a\nrobot avatar based on an anthropomorphic swarm of drones; SwarMan. The\ndeveloped system consists of nine nanocopters controlled remotely by the\noperator through a gesture recognition interface. SwarMan allows operators to\ncommunicate by directly following their motions and by recognizing one of the\nprerecorded emotional patterns, thus rendering the captured emotion as\nillumination on the drones. The LSTM MediaPipe network was trained on a\ncollected dataset of 600 short videos with five emotional gestures. The\naccuracy of achieved emotion recognition was 97% on the test dataset.\nAs communication through the swarm avatar significantly changes the visual\nappearance of the operator, we investigated the ability of the users to\nrecognize and respond to emotions performed by the swarm of drones. The\nexperimental results revealed a high consistency between the users in rating\nemotions. Additionally, users indicated low physical demand (2.25 on the Likert\nscale) and were satisfied with their performance (1.38 on the Likert scale)\nwhen communicating by the SwarMan interface.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a numerical model preserving a class of nontrivial\nsteady-state solutions is proposed to predict waves propagation and waves\nrun-up on coastal zones. The numerical model is based on the Saint-Venant\nsystem with source terms due to variable bottom topography and bed friction\neffects. The resulting nonlinear system is solved using a Godunov-type finite\nvolume method on unstructured triangular grids. A special piecewise linear\nreconstruction of the solution is implemented with a correction technique to\nensure the accuracy of the method and the positivity of the computed water\ndepth. Efficient semi-implicit techniques for the friction terms and a\nwell-balanced formulation for the bottom topography are used to exactly\npreserve stationary steady-state s solutions. Moreover, we prove that the\nnumerical scheme preserves a class of nontrivial steady-state solutions. To\nvalidate the proposed numerical model against experiments, we first demonstrate\nits ability to preserve nontrivial steady-state solutions and then we model\nseveral laboratory experiments for the prediction of waves run-up on sloping\nbeaches. The numerical simulations are in good agreement with laboratory\nexperiments which confirms the robustness and accuracy of the proposed\nnumerical model in predicting waves propagation on coastal areas.",

    "abstract": "Predictive learning uses a known state to generate a future state over a\nperiod of time. It is a challenging task to predict spatiotemporal sequence\nbecause the spatiotemporal sequence varies both in time and space. The\nmainstream method is to model spatial and temporal structures at the same time\nusing RNN-based or transformer-based architecture, and then generates future\ndata by using learned experience in the way of auto-regressive. The method of\nlearning spatial and temporal features simultaneously brings a lot of\nparameters to the model, which makes the model difficult to be convergent. In\nthis paper, a modular design is proposed, which decomposes spatiotemporal\nsequence model into two modules: a spatial encoder-decoder and a predictor.\nThese two modules can extract spatial features and predict future data\nrespectively. The spatial encoder-decoder maps the data into a latent embedding\nspace and generates data from the latent space while the predictor forecasts\nfuture embedding from past. By applying the design to the current research and\nperforming experiments on KTH-Action and MovingMNIST datasets, we both improve\ncomputational performance and obtain state-of-the-art results.",

    "abstract": "Pretrained Language Models (LMs) memorize a vast amount of knowledge during\ninitial pretraining, including information that may violate the privacy of\npersonal lives and identities. Previous work addressing privacy issues for\nlanguage models has mostly focused on data preprocessing and differential\nprivacy methods, both requiring re-training the underlying LM. We propose\nknowledge unlearning as an alternative method to reduce privacy risks for LMs\npost hoc. We show that simply applying the unlikelihood training objective to\ntarget token sequences is effective at forgetting them with little to no\ndegradation of general language modeling performances; it sometimes even\nsubstantially improves the underlying LM with just a few iterations. We also\nfind that sequential unlearning is better than trying to unlearn all the data\nat once and that unlearning is highly dependent on which kind of data (domain)\nis forgotten. By showing comparisons with a previous data preprocessing method\nknown to mitigate privacy risks for LMs, we show that unlearning can give a\nstronger empirical privacy guarantee in scenarios where the data vulnerable to\nextraction attacks are known a priori while being orders of magnitude more\ncomputationally efficient.

    "abstract": "A central question of machine learning is how deep nets manage to learn tasks\nin high dimensions. An appealing hypothesis is that they achieve this feat by\nbuilding a representation of the data where information irrelevant to the task\nis lost. For image datasets, this view is supported by the observation that\nafter (and not before) training, the neural representation becomes less and\nless sensitive to diffeomorphisms acting on images as the signal propagates\nthrough the net. This loss of sensitivity correlates with performance, and\nsurprisingly correlates with a gain of sensitivity to white noise acquired\nduring training. These facts are unexplained, and as we demonstrate still hold\nwhen white noise is added to the images of the training set. Here, we (i) show\nempirically for various architectures that stability to image diffeomorphisms\nis achieved by spatial pooling in the first half of the net, and by channel\npooling in the second half, (ii) introduce a scale-detection task for a simple\nmodel of data where pooling is learned during training, which captures all\nempirical observations above and (iii) compute in this model how stability to\ndiffeomorphisms and noise scale with depth. The scalings are found to depend on\nthe presence of strides in the net architecture. We find that the increased\nsensitivity to noise is due to the perturbing noise piling up during pooling,\nafter being rectified by ReLU units.",

Second, we learn product concepts and their corresponding\nqueries when the given sets of products are associated with multiple product\nconcepts. To achieve these goals, we propose two approaches that combine the\nconcepts of PU learning with Decision Trees and Clustering.

However, each job needs exactly one additional shared resource in\norder to be executed and hence prevents the execution of jobs that need the\nsame resource while being processed. Previously a $(2m/(m+1))$-approximation\nwas the best known result for this problem. Furthermore, a $6/5$-approximation\nfor the case with only two machines was known as well as a PTAS for the case\nwith a constant number of machines.

The approximation schemes make use of the N-fold integer\nprogramming machinery, which has found more and more applications in the field\nof scheduling recently. It is plausible that the latter results can be improved\nand extended to more general cases.

Using a sparse reward conveniently mitigates these\nchallenges. However, the sparse reward represents a challenge on its own, often\nresulting in unsuccessful training of the agent. In this paper, we therefore\naddress the sparse reward problem in RL.

MPs can be broadly categorized into two types: (a)\ndynamics-based approaches that generate smooth trajectories from any initial\nstate, e. g., Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs), and (b) probabilistic\napproaches that capture higher-order statistics of the motion, e. g.,\nProbabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMPs). To date, however, there is no\nmethod that unifies both, i. e. that can generate smooth trajectories from an\narbitrary initial state while capturing higher-order statistics. In this paper,\nwe introduce a unified perspective of both approaches by solving the ODE\nunderlying the DMPs. We convert expensive online numerical integration of DMPs\ninto basis functions that can be computed offline. These basis functions can be\nused to represent trajectories or trajectory distributions similar to ProMPs\nwhile maintaining all the properties of dynamical systems. Since we inherit the\nproperties of both methodologies, we call our proposed model Probabilistic\nDynamic Movement Primitives (ProDMPs). Additionally, we embed ProDMPs in deep\nneural network architecture and propose a new cost function for efficient\nend-to-end learning of higher-order trajectory statistics. To this end, we\nleverage Bayesian Aggregation for non-linear iterative conditioning on sensory\ninputs.

For this reason, we consider a scenario that\nutilizes infrastructure such as road side units (RSUs) and macro base station\n(MBS) in situations where caching of road environment information is required.\nDue to the rapidly changed road environment, a concept which represents a\nfreshness of the road content, age of information (AoI), is important.

However,\ntoo frequent content transmission for the minimum AoI leads to indiscriminate\nuse of network resources. Furthermore, a transmission control, that content AoI\nand service delay are not properly considered adversely, affects user service.\nTherefore, it is important to find an appropriate compromise.

    "abstract": "As the intention is to reduce the amount of thermal generation and to\nincrease the share of clean energy, power systems are increasingly becoming\nsusceptible to frequency instability after outages due to reduced levels of\ninertia. To address this issue frequency constraints are being included in the\nscheduling process, which ensure a tolerable frequency deviation in case of any\ncontingencies. In this paper, a method is proposed to integrate the non-linear\nfrequency nadir constraint into the unit commitment problem, using machine\nlearning. First a synthetic training dataset is generated. Then two of the\navailable classic machine learning methods, namely logistic regression and\nsupport vector machine, are proposed to predict the frequency nadir. To be able\nto compare the machine learning methods to traditional frequency constrained\nunit commitment approaches, simulations on the power system of La Palma island\nare carried out for both proposed methods as well as an analytical linearized\nformulation of the frequency nadir. Our results show that the unit commitment\nproblem with a machine learning based frequency nadir constraint is solved\nconsiderably faster than with the analytical formulation, while still achieving\nan acceptable frequency response quality after outages.",

To this end,\nhyperbolic geometry provides deep RL models with a natural basis to precisely\nencode this inherently hierarchical information. However, applying existing\nmethodologies from the hyperbolic deep learning literature leads to fatal\noptimization instabilities due to the non-stationarity and variance\ncharacterizing RL gradient estimators. Hence, we design a new general method\nthat counteracts such optimization challenges and enables stable end-to-end\nlearning with deep hyperbolic representations. We empirically validate our\nframework by applying it to popular on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms on\nthe Procgen and Atari 100K benchmarks, attaining near universal performance and\ngeneralization benefits.

    "abstract": "Recently, two concepts from optimal transport theory have successfully been\nbrought to the Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) setting. This introduces a linear\nversion of the GW distance and multi-marginal GW transport. The former can\nreduce the computational complexity when computing all GW distances of a large\nset of inputs. The latter allows for a simultaneous matching of more than two\nmarginals, which can for example be used to compute GW barycenters. The aim of\nthis paper is to show an approximation result which characterizes the linear\nversion as a limit of a multi-marginal GW formulation.",

    "abstract": "Lifelong object re-identification incrementally learns from a stream of\nre-identification tasks. The objective is to learn a representation that can be\napplied to all tasks and that generalizes to previously unseen\nre-identification tasks. The main challenge is that at inference time the\nrepresentation must generalize to previously unseen identities. To address this\nproblem, we apply continual meta metric learning to lifelong object\nre-identification. To prevent forgetting of previous tasks, we use knowledge\ndistillation and explore the roles of positive and negative pairs. Based on our\nobservation that the distillation and metric losses are antagonistic, we\npropose to remove positive pairs from distillation to robustify model updates.\nOur method, called Distillation without Positive Pairs (DwoPP), is evaluated on\nextensive intra-domain experiments on person and vehicle re-identification\ndatasets, as well as inter-domain experiments on the LReID benchmark. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that DwoPP significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art. The code is here: https://github.com/wangkai930418/DwoPP_code",

We\nprove that NSR is expressive enough to model various sequence-to-sequence\ntasks. Superior systematic generalization is achieved via the inductive biases\nof equivariance and recursiveness embedded in NSR. In experiments, NSR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in three benchmarks from different domains: SCAN\nfor semantic parsing, PCFG for string manipulation, and HINT for arithmetic\nreasoning. Specifically, NSR achieves 100% generalization accuracy on SCAN and\nPCFG and outperforms state-of-the-art models on HINT by about 23%. Our NSR\ndemonstrates stronger generalization than pure neural networks due to its\nsymbolic representation and inductive biases.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised monocular depth estimation refers to training a monocular\ndepth estimation (MDE) network using only RGB images to overcome the difficulty\nof collecting dense ground truth depth. Many previous works addressed this\nproblem using depth classification or depth regression. However, depth\nclassification tends to fall into local minima due to the bilinear\ninterpolation search on the target view. Depth classification overcomes this\nproblem using pre-divided depth bins, but those depth candidates lead to\ndiscontinuities in the final depth result, and using the same probability for\nweighted summation of color and depth is ambiguous. To overcome these\nlimitations, we use some predefined planes that are parallel to the ground,\nallowing us to automatically segment the ground and predict continuous depth\nfor it. We further model depth as a mixture Laplace distribution, which\nprovides a more certain objective for optimization. Previous works have shown\nthat MDE networks only use the vertical image position of objects to estimate\nthe depth and ignore relative sizes. We address this problem for the first time\nin both stereo and monocular training using resize cropping data augmentation.\nBased on our analysis of resize cropping, we combine it with our plane\ndefinition and improve our training strategy so that the network could learn\nthe relationship between depth and both the vertical image position and\nrelative size of objects. We further combine the self-distillation stage with\npost-processing to provide more accurate supervision and save extra time in\npost-processing.

    "abstract": "Throughout the world, poaching has been an ever-present threat to a vast\narray of species for over many decades. Traditional anti-poaching initiatives\ntarget catching the poachers. However, the challenge is far more complicated\nthan catching individual poachers. Poaching is an industry which needs to be\nfully investigated. Many stakeholders are directly and indirectly involved in\npoaching activities (e.g., some local restaurants illegally providing meat to\ntourists). Therefore, stopping or severely decapitating the poaching industry\nrequires a unified understanding of all stakeholders. The best way to uncover\nthese geographical and social relationships is to track the movements of\npoachers. However, location tracking is challenging in most rural areas where\nwildlife sanctuaries are typically located. Internet-connected communication\n(e.g. 3G) technologies typically used in urban cities are not feasible in these\nrural areas. Therefore, we decided to develop an SMS (short message service)\nbase low-cost tracking system (SMS-TRACCAR) to track poachers. The proposed\nsystem was developed to be deployed in Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, Sabah,\nMalaysia and nearby villages and cities where poachers typically move around.\nOur evaluations demonstrated that SMS-based tracking could provide sufficient\nquality (granular) data (with minimum energy consumption) that enable us to\nmonitor poacher vehicle movements within rural areas where no other modern\ncommunication technologies are feasible to use. However, it is important to\nnote that our system can be used in any domain that requires SMS-based\ngeo-location tracking. SMS-TRACCAR can be configured to track individuals as\nwell as groups. Therefore, SMS-TRACCAR contributes not only to the wildlife\ndomain but in the wider context as well.",

    "abstract": "Deep Metric Learning trains a neural network to map input images to a\nlower-dimensional embedding space such that similar images are closer together\nthan dissimilar images. When used for item retrieval, a query image is embedded\nusing the trained model and the closest items from a database storing their\nrespective embeddings are returned as the most similar items for the query.\nEspecially in product retrieval, where a user searches for a certain product by\ntaking a photo of it, the image background is usually not important and thus\nshould not influence the embedding process. Ideally, the retrieval process\nalways returns fitting items for the photographed object, regardless of the\nenvironment the photo was taken in. In this paper, we analyze the influence of\nthe image background on Deep Metric Learning models by utilizing five common\nloss functions and three common datasets. We find that Deep Metric Learning\nnetworks are prone to so-called background bias, which can lead to a severe\ndecrease in retrieval performance when changing the image background during\ninference. We also show that replacing the background of images during training\nwith random background images alleviates this issue. Since we use an automatic\nbackground removal method to do this background replacement, no additional\nmanual labeling work and model changes are required while inference time stays\nthe same. Qualitative and quantitative analyses, for which we introduce a new\nevaluation metric, confirm that models trained with replaced backgrounds attend\nmore to the main object in the image, benefitting item retrieval systems.",

At the same time, growing interest is being\ndevoted to the energetic sustainability of machine learning. At the\nintersection of these trends, we hence find the energetic characterization of\nmachine learning at the edge, which is attracting increasing attention.\nUnfortunately, calculating the energy consumption of a given neural network\nduring inference is complicated by the heterogeneity of the possible underlying\nhardware implementation. In this work, we hence aim at profiling the energetic\nconsumption of inference tasks for some modern edge nodes and deriving simple\nbut realistic models. To this end, we performed a large number of experiments\nto collect the energy consumption of convolutional and fully connected layers\non two well-known edge boards by NVIDIA, namely Jetson TX2 and Xavier. From the\nmeasurements, we have then distilled a simple, practical model that can provide\nan estimate of the energy consumption of a certain inference task on the\nconsidered boards. We believe that this model can be used in many contexts as,\nfor instance, to guide the search for efficient architectures in Neural\nArchitecture Search, as a heuristic in Neural Network pruning, or to find\nenergy-efficient offloading strategies in a Split computing context, or simply\nto evaluate the energetic performance of Deep Neural Network architectures.",

However,\nBO suffers from the curse of dimensionality, and scaling it to high-dimensional\nproblems is still a challenge. In this paper, we propose a variable selection\nmethod MCTS-VS based on Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), to iteratively select\nand optimize a subset of variables. That is, MCTS-VS constructs a\nlow-dimensional subspace via MCTS and optimizes in the subspace with any BO\nalgorithm. We give a theoretical analysis of the general variable selection\nmethod to reveal how it can work. Experiments on high-dimensional synthetic\nfunctions and real-world problems (i.e., NAS-bench problems and MuJoCo\nlocomotion tasks) show that MCTS-VS equipped with a proper BO optimizer can\nachieve state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Masked image modeling (MIM) revolutionizes self-supervised learning (SSL) for\nimage pre-training. In contrast to previous dominating self-supervised methods,\ni.e., contrastive learning, MIM attains state-of-the-art performance by masking\nand reconstructing random patches of the input image. However, the associated\nsecurity and privacy risks of this novel generative method are unexplored. In\nthis paper, we perform the first security risk quantification of MIM through\nthe lens of backdoor attacks. Different from previous work, we are the first to\nsystematically threat modeling on SSL in every phase of the model supply chain,\ni.e., pre-training, release, and downstream phases. Our evaluation shows that\nmodels built with MIM are vulnerable to existing backdoor attacks in release\nand downstream phases and are compromised by our proposed method in\npre-training phase. For instance, on CIFAR10, the attack success rate can reach\n99.62%, 96.48%, and 98.89% in the downstream phase, release phase, and\npre-training phase, respectively. We also take the first step to investigate\nthe success factors of backdoor attacks in the pre-training phase and find the\ntrigger number and trigger pattern play key roles in the success of backdoor\nattacks while trigger location has only tiny effects. In the end, our empirical\nstudy of the defense mechanisms across three detection-level on model supply\nchain phases indicates that different defenses are suitable for backdoor\nattacks in different phases. However, backdoor attacks in the release phase\ncannot be detected by all three detection-level methods, calling for more\neffective defenses in future research.",

    "abstract": "We study the class of rational recursive sequences (ratrec) over the rational\nnumbers. A ratrec sequence is defined via a system of sequences using mutually\nrecursive equations of depth 1, where the next values are computed as rational\nfunctions of the previous values. An alternative class is that of simple ratrec\nsequences, where one uses a single recursive equation, however of depth k: the\nnext value is defined as a rational function of k previous values.\nWe conjecture that the classes ratrec and simple ratrec coincide. The main\ncontribution of this paper is a proof of a variant of this conjecture where the\ninitial conditions are treated symbolically, using a formal variable per\nsequence, while the sequences themselves consist of rational functions over\nthose variables. While the initial conjecture does not follow from this\nvariant, we hope that the introduced algebraic techniques may eventually be\nhelpful in resolving the problem.\nThe class ratrec strictly generalises a well-known class of polynomial\nrecursive sequences (polyrec). These are defined like ratrec, but using\npolynomial functions instead of rational ones. One can observe that if our\nconjecture is true and effective, then we can improve the complexities of the\nzeroness and the equivalence problems for polyrec sequences. Currently, the\nonly known upper bound is Ackermanian, which follows from results on polynomial\nautomata. We complement this observation by proving a PSPACE lower bound for\nboth problems for polyrec. Our lower bound construction also implies that the\nSkolem problem is PSPACE-hard for the polyrec class.",

This renders the bus arrival time prediction (BATP) to\nbe a challenging problem especially in the developing world. A novel\ndata-driven model based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is proposed for\nBATP (in real-time) in the current work. The model intelligently incorporates\nboth spatial and temporal correlations in a unique (non-linear) fashion\ndistinct from existing approaches.

The geometry of the dynamic real\ntime BATP problem enables a nice fit with the Encoder-Decoder based RNN\nstructure. We feed relevant additional synchronized inputs (from previous\ntrips) at each step of the decoder (a feature classically unexplored in machine\ntranslation applications). Further motivated from accurately modelling\ncongestion influences on travel time prediction, we additionally propose to use\na bidirectional layer at the decoder (something unexplored in other time-series\nbased ED application contexts).

In this paper, a surrogate-based design optimization framework is\npresented to implement the concept of passively load-adaptive structures (of\ngiven outer shape) synthesized from auxetic unit cells. Open-source meshing,\nFEA and Bayesian Optimization tools are integrated to develop this\ncomputational framework, enhancing it adopt-ability and extensibility.\nDemonstration of the concept and the underlying framework is performed by\ndesigning a simplified robotic gripper, with the objective to maximize the\nratio of towards-load (gripping) horizontal displacement to the load-affected\nvertical displacement. Optimal auxetic cell-based design generated thereof is\nfound to be four times better in terms of exhibited contact reaction force when\ncompared to a design obtained with topology optimization that is subjected to\nthe same specified maximum loading.",

    "title": "Synthesizing Dominant Strategies for Liveness (Full Version)",
    "abstract": "Reactive synthesis automatically derives a strategy that satisfies a given\nspecification. However, requiring a strategy to meet the specification in every\nsituation is, in many cases, too hard of a requirement. Particularly in\ncompositional synthesis of distributed systems, individual winning strategies\nfor the processes often do not exist. Remorsefree dominance, a weaker notion\nthan winning, accounts for such situations: dominant strategies are only\nrequired to be as good as any alternative strategy, i.e., they are allowed to\nviolate the specification if no other strategy would have satisfied it in the\nsame situation. The composition of dominant strategies is only guaranteed to be\ndominant for safety properties, though; preventing the use of dominance in\ncompositional synthesis for liveness specifications. Yet, safety properties are\noften not expressive enough. In this paper, we thus introduce a new winning\ncondition for strategies, called delay-dominance, that overcomes this weakness\nof remorsefree~dominance: we show that it is compositional for both safety and\nliveness specifications, enabling a compositional synthesis algorithm based on\ndelay-dominance for general specifications. Furthermore, we introduce an\nautomaton construction for recognizing delay-dominant strategies and prove its\nsoundness and completeness. The resulting automaton is of single-exponential\nsize in the squared length of the specification and can immediately be used for\nsafraless synthesis procedures. Thus, synthesis of delay-dominant strategies\nis, as synthesis of winning strategies, in 2EXPTIME.",

    "abstract": "Natural language (NL) documentation is the bridge between software managers\nand testers, and NL test cases are prevalent in system-level testing and other\nquality assurance activities. Due to reasons such as requirements redundancy,\nparallel testing, and tester turnover within long evolving history, there are\ninevitably lots of redundant test cases, which significantly increase the cost.\nPrevious redundancy detection approaches typically treat the textual\ndescriptions as a whole to compare their similarity and suffer from low\nprecision. Our observation reveals that a test case can have explicit\ntest-oriented entities, such as tested function Components, Constraints, etc;\nand there are also specific relations between these entities. This inspires us\nwith a potential opportunity for accurate redundancy detection. In this paper,\nwe first define five test-oriented entity categories and four associated\nrelation categories and re-formulate the NL test case redundancy detection\nproblem as the comparison of detailed testing content guided by the\ntest-oriented entities and relations. Following that, we propose Tscope, a\nfine-grained approach for redundant NL test case detection by dissecting test\ncases into atomic test tuple(s) with the entities restricted by associated\nrelations. To serve as the test case dissection, Tscope designs a context-aware\nmodel for the automatic entity and relation extraction. Evaluation on 3,467\ntest cases from ten projects shows Tscope could achieve 91.8% precision, 74.8%\nrecall, and 82.4% F1, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches\nand commonly-used classifiers. This new formulation of the NL test case\nredundant detection problem can motivate the follow-up studies to further\nimprove this task and other related tasks involving NL descriptions.",

Several attempts have been made at\nmodel-based multi-robot localization, and few have formulated the multi-robot\ncollaborative localization problem as a factor graph problem to solve through\ngraph optimization. Here, the optimization objective is to minimize the errors\nof estimating the relative location estimates in a distributed manner.

    "abstract": "Robotic taxonomies have appeared as high-level hierarchical abstractions that\nclassify how humans move and interact with their environment. They have proven\nuseful to analyse grasps, manipulation skills, and whole-body support poses.\nDespite the efforts devoted to design their hierarchy and underlying\ncategories, their use in application fields remains scarce. This may be\nattributed to the lack of computational models that fill the gap between the\ndiscrete hierarchical structure of the taxonomy and the high-dimensional\nheterogeneous data associated to its categories. To overcome this problem, we\npropose to model taxonomy data via hyperbolic embeddings that capture the\nassociated hierarchical structure. To do so, we formulate a Gaussian process\nhyperbolic latent variable model and enforce the taxonomy structure through\ngraph-based priors on the latent space and distance-preserving back\nconstraints. We test our model on the whole-body support pose taxonomy to learn\nhyperbolic embeddings that comply with the original graph structure. We show\nthat our model properly encodes unseen poses from existing or new taxonomy\ncategories, it can be used to generate trajectories between the embeddings, and\nit outperforms its Euclidean counterparts.",

    "title": "Robust Target Training for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Given multiple labeled source domains and a single target domain, most\nexisting multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) models are trained on data from\nall domains jointly in one step. Such an one-step approach limits their ability\nto adapt to the target domain. This is because the training set is dominated by\nthe more numerous and labeled source domain data. The source-domain-bias can\npotentially be alleviated by introducing a second training step, where the\nmodel is fine-tuned with the unlabeled target domain data only using pseudo\nlabels as supervision. However, the pseudo labels are inevitably noisy and when\nused unchecked can negatively impact the model performance. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Bi-level Optimization based Robust Target Training\n(BORT$^2$) method for MSDA. Given any existing fully-trained one-step MSDA\nmodel, BORT$^2$ turns it to a labeling function to generate pseudo-labels for\nthe target data and trains a target model using pseudo-labeled target data\nonly. Crucially, the target model is a stochastic CNN which is designed to be\nintrinsically robust against label noise generated by the labeling function.\nSuch a stochastic CNN models each target instance feature as a Gaussian\ndistribution with an entropy maximization regularizer deployed to measure the\nlabel uncertainty, which is further exploited to alleviate the negative impact\nof noisy pseudo labels. Training the labeling function and the target model\nposes a nested bi-level optimization problem, for which we formulate an elegant\nsolution based on implicit differentiation. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our proposed method achieves the state of the art performance on three\nMSDA benchmarks, including the large-scale DomainNet dataset.

Using this we are able to control the error made by a (Smolyak)\ntruncated Faber-Schauder series in $L_q$ with $q<\\infty$. It turns out that the\nmain rate of convergence is sharp. As a consequence we obtain results also for\n$S^1_{1,\\infty}F([0,1]^d)$, a space which is ``close'' to the space\n$S^1_1W([0,1]^d)$ which is important in numerical analysis, especially\nnumerical integration, but has rather bad Fourier analytic properties.",

    "abstract": "Detecting anomalies over real-world datasets remains a challenging task. Data\nannotation is an intensive human labor problem, particularly in sequential\ndatasets, where the start and end time of anomalies are not known. As a result,\ndata collected from sequential real-world processes can be largely unlabeled or\ncontain inaccurate labels. These characteristics challenge the application of\nanomaly detection techniques based on supervised learning. In contrast,\nMultiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been shown effective on problems with\nincomplete knowledge of labels in the training dataset, mainly due to the\nnotion of bags. While largely under-leveraged for anomaly detection, MIL\nprovides an appealing formulation for anomaly detection over real-world\ndatasets, and it is the primary contribution of this paper. In this paper, we\npropose an MIL-based formulation and various algorithmic instantiations of this\nframework based on different design decisions for key components of the\nframework. We evaluate the resulting algorithms over four datasets that capture\ndifferent physical processes along different modalities. The experimental\nevaluation draws out several observations. The MIL-based formulation performs\nno worse than single instance learning on easy to moderate datasets and\noutperforms single-instance learning on more challenging datasets. Altogether,\nthe results show that the framework generalizes well over diverse datasets\nresulting from different real-world application domains.",

In the typical FL paradigm (e.g., FedAvg), model weights are\nsent to and from the server each round to participating clients. However, this\ncan quickly put a massive communication burden on the system, especially if\nmore capable models beyond very small MLPs are employed. Recently, the use of\npre-trained models has been shown effective in federated learning optimization\nand improving convergence. This opens the door for new research questions. Can\nwe adjust the weight-sharing paradigm in federated learning, leveraging strong\nand readily-available pre-trained models, to significantly reduce the\ncommunication burden while simultaneously achieving excellent performance? To\nthis end, we investigate the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in\nfederated learning. Specifically, we systemically evaluate the performance of\nseveral parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods across a variety of client\nstability, data distribution, and differential privacy settings. By only\nlocally tuning and globally sharing a small portion of the model weights,\nsignificant reductions in the total communication overhead can be achieved\nwhile maintaining competitive performance in a wide range of federated learning\nscenarios, providing insight into a new paradigm for practical and effective\nfederated systems.",

This paper proposes a novel\nmethod, DiffRes, that enables differentiable temporal resolution learning to\nimprove the performance of audio classification models. Given a spectrogram\ncalculated with a fixed hop size, DiffRes merges non-essential time frames\nwhile preserving important frames. DiffRes acts as a \"drop-in\" module between\nan audio spectrogram and a classifier, and can be end-to-end optimized. We\nevaluate DiffRes on the mel-spectrogram, followed by state-of-the-art\nclassifier backbones, and apply it to five different subtasks. Compared with\nusing the fixed-resolution mel-spectrogram, the DiffRes-based method can\nachieve the same or better classification accuracy with at least 25% fewer\ntemporal dimensions on the feature level, which alleviates the computational\ncost at the same time.

Large offline labeled datasets do not exist for all\nbut the most common articulated object categories (e.g., humans). Hand labeling\nthese landmarks within a video sequence is a laborious task. Learned landmark\ndetectors can help, but can be error-prone when trained from only a few\nexamples. Multi-camera systems that train fine-grained detectors have shown\nsignificant promise in detecting such errors, allowing for self-supervised\nsolutions that only need a small percentage of the video sequence to be\nhand-labeled. The approach, however, is based on calibrated cameras and rigid\ngeometry, making it expensive, difficult to manage, and impractical in\nreal-world scenarios. In this paper, we address these bottlenecks by combining\na non-rigid 3D neural prior with deep flow to obtain high-fidelity landmark\nestimates from videos with only two or three uncalibrated, handheld cameras.\nWith just a few annotations (representing 1-2% of the frames), we are able to\nproduce 2D results comparable to state-of-the-art fully supervised methods,\nalong with 3D reconstructions that are impossible with other existing\napproaches.

    "abstract": "A multitude of work has shown that machine learning-based medical diagnosis\nsystems can be biased against certain subgroups of people. This has motivated a\ngrowing number of bias mitigation algorithms that aim to address fairness\nissues in machine learning. However, it is difficult to compare their\neffectiveness in medical imaging for two reasons. First, there is little\nconsensus on the criteria to assess fairness. Second, existing bias mitigation\nalgorithms are developed under different settings, e.g., datasets, model\nselection strategies, backbones, and fairness metrics, making a direct\ncomparison and evaluation based on existing results impossible. In this work,\nwe introduce MEDFAIR, a framework to benchmark the fairness of machine learning\nmodels for medical imaging. MEDFAIR covers eleven algorithms from various\ncategories, nine datasets from different imaging modalities, and three model\nselection criteria. Through extensive experiments, we find that the\nunder-studied issue of model selection criterion can have a significant impact\non fairness outcomes; while in contrast, state-of-the-art bias mitigation\nalgorithms do not significantly improve fairness outcomes over empirical risk\nminimization (ERM) in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. We\nevaluate fairness from various perspectives and make recommendations for\ndifferent medical application scenarios that require different ethical\nprinciples. Our framework provides a reproducible and easy-to-use entry point\nfor the development and evaluation of future bias mitigation algorithms in deep\nlearning.

However, traditional CNN models rely on small\nkernel filters to obtain local features from images. Thus, an excessively deep\nCNN is required to capture global features, which are critical for fault\ndiagnosis of dynamical systems. In this work, we present an improved CNN that\nembeds global features (GF-CNN). Our method uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)\nfor dimension reduction to directly extract global features and integrate them\ninto the CNN. The advantage of this method is that both local and global\npatterns in images can be captured by a simple model architecture instead of\nestablishing deep CNN models. The proposed method is applied to the fault\ndiagnosis of the Tennessee Eastman process. Simulation results show that the\nGF-CNN can significantly improve the fault diagnosis performance compared to\ntraditional CNN. The proposed method can also be applied to other areas such as\ncomputer vision and image processing.",

This performative\nprediction setting raises new challenges for learning \"optimal\" decision rules.\nIn particular, existing solution concepts do not address the apparent tension\nbetween the goals of forecasting outcomes accurately and steering individuals\nto achieve desirable outcomes.\nTo contend with this concern, we introduce a new optimality concept --\nperformative omniprediction -- adapted from the supervised (non-performative)\nlearning setting. A performative omnipredictor is a single predictor that\nsimultaneously encodes the optimal decision rule with respect to many\npossibly-competing objectives. Our main result demonstrates that efficient\nperformative omnipredictors exist, under a natural restriction of performative\nprediction, which we call outcome performativity. On a technical level, our\nresults follow by carefully generalizing the notion of outcome\nindistinguishability to the outcome performative setting. From an appropriate\nnotion of Performative OI, we recover many consequences known to hold in the\nsupervised setting, such as omniprediction and universal adaptability.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, imitation learning (IL) has been widely used in industry as\nthe core of autonomous vehicle (AV) planning modules. However, previous work on\nIL planners shows sample inefficiency and low generalisation in safety-critical\nscenarios, on which they are rarely tested. As a result, IL planners can reach\na performance plateau where adding more training data ceases to improve the\nlearnt policy. First, our work presents an IL model using the spline\ncoefficient parameterisation and offline expert queries to enhance safety and\ntraining efficiency. Then, we expose the weakness of the learnt IL policy by\nsynthetically generating critical scenarios through optimisation of parameters\nof the driver's risk field (DRF), a parametric human driving behaviour model\nimplemented in a multi-agent traffic simulator based on the Lyft Prediction\nDataset. To continuously improve the learnt policy, we retrain the IL model\nwith augmented data. Thanks to the expressivity and interpretability of the\nDRF, the desired driving behaviours can be encoded and aggregated to the\noriginal training data. Our work constitutes a full development cycle that can\nefficiently and continuously improve the learnt IL policies in closed-loop.\nFinally, we show that our IL planner developed with 30 times less training\nresource still has superior performance compared to the previous\nstate-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are promising security primitives for\nresource-constrained IoT devices. And the XOR Arbiter PUF (XOR-PUF) is one of\nthe most studied PUFs, out of an effort to improve the resistance against\nmachine learning attacks of probably the most lightweight delay-based PUFs -\nthe Arbiter PUFs. However, recent attack studies reveal that even XOR-PUFs with\nlarge XOR sizes are still not safe against machine learning attacks. Increasing\nPUF stages or components and using different challenges for different\ncomponents are two ways to improve the security of APUF-based PUFs, but more\nstages or components lead to more hardware cost and higher operation power, and\ndifferent challenges for different components require the transmission of more\nbits during operations, which also leads to higher power consumption. In this\npaper, we present a strategy that combines the choice of XOR Arbiter PUF\n(XOR-PUF) architecture parameters with the way XOR-PUFs are used to achieve\nlightweights in hardware cost and energy consumption as well as security\nagainst machine learning attacks. Experimental evaluations show that with the\nproposed strategy, highly lightweight component-differentially challenged\nXOR-PUFs can withstand the most powerful machine learning attacks developed so\nfar and maintain excellent intra-device and inter-device performance, rendering\nthis strategy a potential blueprint for the fabrication and use of XOR-PUFs for\nresource-constrained IoT applications.",

In the MAS considered in this paper, each\nagent privatizes its sensitive information from other agents using a\ndifferential privacy mechanism. In other words, each agent adds privacy noise\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) to its output to maintain its privacy and communicates\nits noisy output with its neighboring agents. We define two types of MTL\nspecifications for the MAS: agent-level specifications and system-level\nspecifications. Agents should collaborate to satisfy the system-level MTL\nspecifications with a minimum probability while each agent must satisfy its own\nagent-level MTL specifications at the same time. In the proposed distributed\nRHC approach, each agent communicates with its neighboring agents to acquire\ntheir noisy outputs and calculates an estimate of the system-level trajectory.\nThen each agent synthesizes its own control inputs such that the system-level\nspecifications are satisfied with a minimum probability while the agent-level\nspecifications are also satisfied. In the proposed optimization formulation of\nRHC, we directly incorporate Kalman filter equations to calculate the estimates\nof the system-level trajectory, and we use mixed-integer linear programming\n(MILP) to encode the MTL specifications as optimization constraints.

    "abstract": "Unlike vision and language data which usually has a unique format, molecules\ncan naturally be characterized using different chemical formulations. One can\nview a molecule as a 2D graph or define it as a collection of atoms located in\na 3D space. For molecular representation learning, most previous works designed\nneural networks only for a particular data format, making the learned models\nlikely to fail for other data formats. We believe a general-purpose neural\nnetwork model for chemistry should be able to handle molecular tasks across\ndata modalities. To achieve this goal, in this work, we develop a novel\nTransformer-based Molecular model called Transformer-M, which can take\nmolecular data of 2D or 3D formats as input and generate meaningful semantic\nrepresentations. Using the standard Transformer as the backbone architecture,\nTransformer-M develops two separated channels to encode 2D and 3D structural\ninformation and incorporate them with the atom features in the network modules.\nWhen the input data is in a particular format, the corresponding channel will\nbe activated, and the other will be disabled. By training on 2D and 3D\nmolecular data with properly designed supervised signals, Transformer-M\nautomatically learns to leverage knowledge from different data modalities and\ncorrectly capture the representations. We conducted extensive experiments for\nTransformer-M. All empirical results show that Transformer-M can simultaneously\nachieve strong performance on 2D and 3D tasks, suggesting its broad\napplicability.

In this paper, we propose a risk-aware intelligent intersection\nsystem for autonomous vehicles (AVs) as well as human-driven vehicles (HVs). We\ncast the problem as a novel class of Multi-agent Chance-Constrained Stochastic\nShortest Path (MCC-SSP) problems and devise an exact Integer Linear Programming\n(ILP) formulation that is scalable in the number of agents' interaction points\n(e.g., potential collision points at the intersection). In particular, when the\nnumber of agents within an interaction point is small, which is often the case\nin intersections, the ILP has a polynomial number of variables and constraints.\nTo further improve the running time performance, we show that the collision\nrisk computation can be performed offline. Additionally, a trajectory\noptimization workflow is provided to generate risk-aware trajectories for any\ngiven intersection. The proposed framework is implemented in CARLA simulator\nand evaluated under a fully autonomous intersection with AVs only as well as in\na hybrid setup with a signalized intersection for HVs and an intelligent scheme\nfor AVs.

In this paper, we propose the\nchallenging and novel problem of predicting human-scene collisions for diverse\nenvironments from multi-view egocentric RGB videos captured from an\nexoskeleton. By classifying which body joints will collide with the environment\nand predicting a collision region heatmap that localizes potential collisions\nin the environment, we aim to develop an exoskeleton perception system that\ngeneralizes to complex real-world scenes and provides actionable outputs for\ndownstream control.

To train and evaluate the model, we build a synthetic data\ngeneration framework to simulate virtual humans moving in photo-realistic 3D\nenvironments. This framework is then used to establish a dataset consisting of\n8.6M egocentric RGBD frames to enable future work on the problem.

    "abstract": "While federated learning (FL) promises to preserve privacy in distributed\ntraining of deep learning models, recent work in the image and NLP domains\nshowed that training updates leak private data of participating clients. At the\nsame time, most high-stakes applications of FL (e.g., legal and financial) use\ntabular data. Compared to the NLP and image domains, reconstruction of tabular\ndata poses several unique challenges: (i) categorical features introduce a\nsignificantly more difficult mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem,\n(ii) the mix of categorical and continuous features causes high variance in the\nfinal reconstructions, and (iii) structured data makes it difficult for the\nadversary to judge reconstruction quality. In this work, we tackle these\nchallenges and propose the first comprehensive reconstruction attack on tabular\ndata, called TabLeak. TabLeak is based on three key ingredients: (i) a softmax\nstructural prior, implicitly converting the mixed discrete-continuous\noptimization problem into an easier fully continuous one, (ii) a way to reduce\nthe variance of our reconstructions through a pooled ensembling scheme\nexploiting the structure of tabular data, and (iii) an entropy measure which\ncan successfully assess reconstruction quality. Our experimental evaluation\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of TabLeak, reaching a state-of-the-art on four\npopular tabular datasets. For instance, on the Adult dataset, we improve attack\naccuracy by 10% compared to the baseline on the practically relevant batch size\nof 32 and further obtain non-trivial reconstructions for batch sizes as large\nas 128. Our findings are important as they show that performing FL on tabular\ndata, which often poses high privacy risks, is highly vulnerable.",

Machine learning (ML) can accelerate\nthe process of searching for desirable ionic molecules through accurate and\nefficient property predictions in a data-driven manner. But existing\ndescriptors and ML models for the ionic molecule suffer from the inefficient\nadaptation of molecular graph structure. Besides, few works have investigated\nthe explainability of ML models to help understand the learned features that\ncan guide the design of efficient ionic molecules. In this work, we develop\nboth fingerprint-based ML models and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict\nthe CO$_2$ absorption in ILs.

We show that our method\noutperforms previous ML models by reaching a high accuracy (MAE of 0.0137,\n$R^2$ of 0.9884). Furthermore, we take the advantage of GNNs feature\nrepresentation and develop a substructure-based explanation method that\nprovides insight into how each chemical fragments within IL molecules\ncontribute to the CO$_2$ absorption prediction of ML models.

We focus\non how much the algorithm relies on virality (how many times a story has been\npreviously shared) when generating news feeds. Showing users more viral stories\ncan increase information aggregation, but it can also generate steady states\nwhere most shared stories are wrong. Such misleading steady states\nself-perpetuate, as users who observe these wrong stories develop wrong\nbeliefs, and thus rationally continue to share them. We find that these bad\nsteady states appear discontinuously, and even a benevolent platform designer\neither accepts these misleading steady states or induces fragile learning\noutcomes in the optimal design.",

To address the\nlimitations of existing quantum ML methods, we introduce Quark, a gradient-free\nquantum learning framework that optimizes quantum ML models using quantum\noptimization. Quark does not rely on gradient computation and therefore avoids\nbarren plateau and frequent classical-quantum interactions.

In distributed interactive proofs, the nodes of an $n$-node network $G$\ncan exchange short messages (called certificates) with a powerful prover. The\ngoal is to decide if the input (including $G$ itself) belongs to some language,\nwith as few turns of interaction and as few bits exchanged between nodes and\nthe prover as possible. There are several results showing that the size of\ncertificates can be reduced drastically with a constant number of interactions\ncompared to non-interactive distributed proofs. In this paper, we introduce the\nquantum counterpart of distributed interactive proofs: certificates can now be\nquantum bits, and the nodes of the network can perform quantum computation. The\nfirst result of this paper shows that by using quantum distributed interactive\nproofs, the number of interactions can be significantly reduced. More\nprecisely, our result shows that for any constant~$k$, the class of languages\nthat can be decided by a $k$-turn classical (i.e., non-quantum) distributed\ninteractive protocol with $f(n)$-bit certificate size is contained in the class\nof languages that can be decided by a $5$-turn distributed quantum interactive\nprotocol with $O(f(n))$-bit certificate size. We also show that if we allow to\nuse shared randomness, the number of turns can be reduced to 3-turn. Since no\nsimilar turn-reduction \\emph{classical} technique is currently known, our\nresult gives evidence of the power of quantum computation in the setting of\ndistributed interactive proofs as well.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, computational approaches to graph partitioning have made\na major impact in the analysis of political redistricting, including in U.S.\ncourts of law. Mathematically, a districting plan can be viewed as a balanced\npartition of a graph into connected subsets. Examining a large sample of valid\nalternative districting plans can help us recognize gerrymandering against an\nappropriate neutral baseline. One algorithm that is widely used to produce\nrandom samples of districting plans is a Markov chain called recombination (or\nReCom), which repeatedly fuses adjacent districts, forms a spanning tree of\ntheir union, and splits that spanning tree with a balanced cut to form new\ndistricts. One drawback is that this chain's stationary distribution has no\nknown closed form when there are three or more districts. In this paper, we\nmodify ReCom slightly to give it a property called reversibility, resulting in\na new Markov chain, RevReCom. This new chain converges to the simple, natural\ndistribution that ReCom was originally designed to approximate: a plan's\nstationary probability is proportional to the product of the number of spanning\ntrees of each district. This spanning tree score is a measure of district\n\"compactness\" (or shape) that is also aligned with notions of community\nstructure from network science. After deriving the steady state formally, we\npresent diagnostic evidence that the convergence is efficient enough for the\nmethod to be practically useful, giving high-quality samples for full-sized\nproblems within several hours. In addition to the primary application of\nbenchmarking of redistricting plans (i.e., describing a normal range for\nstatistics), this chain can also be used to validate other methods that target\nthe spanning tree distribution.",

For general nonlinear systems, however, the main challenge\nis to find such a transformation and to ensure that it is injective. This paper\naddresses this challenge by proposing a learning method that employs supervised\nphysics-informed neural networks to approximate both the transformation and its\ninverse. It is shown that the proposed method exhibits better generalization\ncapabilities than other contemporary methods.

A key challenge in\napplying MCMC to scientific domains is computation: the target density of\ninterest is often a function of expensive computations, such as a high-fidelity\nphysical simulation, an intractable integral, or a slowly-converging iterative\nalgorithm. Thus, using an MCMC algorithms with an expensive target density\nbecomes impractical, as these expensive computations need to be evaluated at\neach iteration of the algorithm. In practice, these computations often\napproximated via a cheaper, low-fidelity computation, leading to bias in the\nresulting target density. Multi-fidelity MCMC algorithms combine models of\nvarying fidelities in order to obtain an approximate target density with lower\ncomputational cost. In this paper, we describe a class of asymptotically exact\nmulti-fidelity MCMC algorithms for the setting where a sequence of models of\nincreasing fidelity can be computed that approximates the expensive target\ndensity of interest. We take a pseudo-marginal MCMC approach for multi-fidelity\ninference that utilizes a cheaper, randomized-fidelity unbiased estimator of\nthe target fidelity constructed via random truncation of a telescoping series\nof the low-fidelity sequence of models. Finally, we discuss and evaluate the\nproposed multi-fidelity MCMC approach on several applications, including\nlog-Gaussian Cox process modeling, Bayesian ODE system identification,\nPDE-constrained optimization, and Gaussian process regression parameter\ninference.",

Concerning bounds, for a strongly oriented graph\n$D$, we prove that ${hn_g}(D)\\leq m(D)-n(D)+2$ and that there is a strongly\noriented graph such that ${hn_g}(D) = m(D)-n(D)$. We also determine exact\nvalues for the hull numbers in these three convexities for tournaments, which\nimply polynomial-time algorithms to compute them. These results allows us to\ndeduce polynomial-time algorithms to compute ${hn_{P_3}}(D)$ when the\nunderlying graph of $D$ is split or cobipartite.

    "abstract": "Generating virtual populations of anatomy that capture sufficient variability\nwhile remaining plausible is essential for conducting in-silico trials of\nmedical devices. However, not all anatomical shapes of interest are always\navailable for each individual in a population. Hence,\nmissing/partially-overlapping anatomical information is often available across\nindividuals in a population. We introduce a generative shape model for complex\nanatomical structures, learnable from datasets of unpaired datasets. The\nproposed generative model can synthesise complete whole complex shape\nassemblies coined virtual chimaeras, as opposed to natural human chimaeras. We\napplied this framework to build virtual chimaeras from databases of whole-heart\nshape assemblies that each contribute samples for heart substructures.\nSpecifically, we propose a generative shape compositional framework which\ncomprises two components - a part-aware generative shape model which captures\nthe variability in shape observed for each structure of interest in the\ntraining population; and a spatial composition network which assembles/composes\nthe structures synthesised by the former into multi-part shape assemblies (viz.\nvirtual chimaeras). We also propose a novel self supervised learning scheme\nthat enables the spatial composition network to be trained with partially\noverlapping data and weak labels. We trained and validated our approach using\nshapes of cardiac structures derived from cardiac magnetic resonance images\navailable in the UK Biobank. Our approach significantly outperforms a PCA-based\nshape model (trained with complete data) in terms of generalisability and\nspecificity. This demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach as the\nsynthesised cardiac virtual populations are more plausible and capture a\ngreater degree of variability in shape than those generated by the PCA-based\nshape model.",

    "abstract": "Fully compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are a fundamental\ntool for investigating the role of dynamo amplification in the generation of\nmagnetic fields in deep convective layers of stars. The flows that arise in\nsuch environments are characterized by low (sonic) Mach numbers (M_son < 0.01\n). In these regimes, conventional MHD codes typically show excessive\ndissipation and tend to be inefficient as the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)\nconstraint on the time step becomes too strict. In this work we present a new\nmethod for efficiently simulating MHD flows at low Mach numbers in a\nspace-dependent gravitational potential while still retaining all effects of\ncompressibility. The proposed scheme is implemented in the finite-volume\nSeven-League Hydro (SLH) code, and it makes use of a low-Mach version of the\nfive-wave Harten-Lax-van Leer discontinuities (HLLD) solver to reduce numerical\ndissipation, an implicit-explicit time discretization technique based on Strang\nsplitting to overcome the overly strict CFL constraint, and a well-balancing\nmethod that dramatically reduces the magnitude of spatial discretization errors\nin strongly stratified setups. The solenoidal constraint on the magnetic field\nis enforced by using a constrained transport method on a staggered grid. We\ncarry out five verification tests, including the simulation of a small-scale\ndynamo in a star-like environment at M_son ~ 0.001 . We demonstrate that the\nproposed scheme can be used to accurately simulate compressible MHD flows in\nregimes of low Mach numbers and strongly stratified setups even with moderately\ncoarse grids.",

Despite the great performances\ndemonstrated in the literature, limitations still remain when dealing with 3D\nvolumes generated slice by slice from unpaired datasets with different fields\nof view. We present an extension of CycleGAN to generate high fidelity images,\nwith good structural consistency, in this context. We leverage anatomical\nconstraints and automatic region of interest selection by adapting the\nSelf-Supervised Body Regressor. These constraints enforce anatomical\nconsistency and allow feeding anatomically-paired input images to the\nalgorithm. Results show qualitative and quantitative improvements, compared to\nstateof-the-art methods, on the translation task between ceCT and CT images\n(and vice versa).",

The goal of\nthe first problem, which is called the exact CS problem, is to steer the mean\nand the covariance of the state process to their desired values in finite time.\nIn the second one, which is called the ``relaxed'' CS problem, the covariance\nassignment constraint is relaxed into a positive semi-definite constraint. We\nshow that the relaxed CS problem can be cast as an equivalent convex\nsemi-definite program (SDP) after applying suitable variable transformations\nand constraint relaxations. Furthermore, we propose a two-step solution\nprocedure for the exact CS problem based on the relaxed problem formulation\nwhich returns a feasible solution, if there exists one. Finally, results from\nnumerical experiments are provided to show the efficacy of the proposed\nsolution methods.",

    "abstract": "The firing dynamics of biological neurons in mathematical models is often\ndetermined by the model's parameters, representing the neurons' underlying\nproperties. The parameter estimation problem seeks to recover those parameters\nof a single neuron or a neuron population from their responses to external\nstimuli and interactions between themselves. Most common methods for tackling\nthis problem in the literature use some mechanistic models in conjunction with\neither a simulation-based or solution-based optimization scheme. In this paper,\nwe study an automatic approach of learning the parameters of neuron populations\nfrom a training set consisting of pairs of spiking series and parameter labels\nvia supervised learning. Unlike previous work, this automatic learning does not\nrequire additional simulations at inference time nor expert knowledge in\nderiving an analytical solution or in constructing some approximate models. We\nsimulate many neuronal populations with different parameter settings using a\nstochastic neuron model. Using that data, we train a variety of supervised\nmachine learning models, including convolutional and deep neural networks,\nrandom forest, and support vector regression. We then compare their performance\nagainst classical approaches including a genetic search, Bayesian sequential\nestimation, and a random walk approximate model. The supervised models almost\nalways outperform the classical methods in parameter estimation and spike\nreconstruction errors, and computation expense. Convolutional neural network,\nin particular, is the best among all models across all metrics. The supervised\nmodels can also generalize to out-of-distribution data to a certain extent.",

Here we mathematically prove that simple biological constraints on\nneurons, namely nonnegativity and energy efficiency in both activity and\nweights, promote such sought after disentangled representations by enforcing\nneurons to become selective for single factors of task variation. We\ndemonstrate these constraints lead to disentangling in a variety of tasks and\narchitectures, including variational autoencoders. We also use this theory to\nexplain why the brain partitions its cells into distinct cell types such as\ngrid and object-vector cells, and also explain when the brain instead entangles\nrepresentations in response to entangled task factors. Overall, this work\nprovides a mathematical understanding of why, when, and how neurons represent\nfactors in both brains and machines, and is a first step towards understanding\nof how task demands structure neural representations.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the brain encodes external stimuli and how these stimuli\ncan be decoded from the measured brain activities are long-standing and\nchallenging questions in neuroscience. In this paper, we focus on\nreconstructing the complex image stimuli from fMRI (functional magnetic\nresonance imaging) signals. Unlike previous works that reconstruct images with\nsingle objects or simple shapes, our work aims to reconstruct image stimuli\nthat are rich in semantics, closer to everyday scenes, and can reveal more\nperspectives. However, data scarcity of fMRI datasets is the main obstacle to\napplying state-of-the-art deep learning models to this problem. We find that\nincorporating an additional text modality is beneficial for the reconstruction\nproblem compared to directly translating brain signals to images. Therefore,\nthe modalities involved in our method are: (i) voxel-level fMRI signals, (ii)\nobserved images that trigger the brain signals, and (iii) textual description\nof the images. To further address data scarcity, we leverage an aligned\nvision-language latent space pre-trained on massive datasets. Instead of\ntraining models from scratch to find a latent space shared by the three\nmodalities, we encode fMRI signals into this pre-aligned latent space. Then,\nconditioned on embeddings in this space, we reconstruct images with a\ngenerative model. The reconstructed images from our pipeline balance both\nnaturalness and fidelity: they are photo-realistic and capture the ground truth\nimage contents well.",

Moreover,\nfor a fine-grained analysis of atrophy patterns, the parcellation of the\ncortical surfaces into individual brain regions is required. For the former\ntask, powerful deep learning approaches, which provide highly accurate brain\nsurfaces of tissue boundaries from input MRI scans in seconds, have recently\nbeen proposed. However, these methods do not come with the ability to provide a\nparcellation of the reconstructed surfaces. Instead, separate\nbrain-parcellation methods have been developed, which typically consider the\ncortical surfaces as given, often computed beforehand with FreeSurfer. In this\nwork, we propose two options, one based on a graph classification branch and\nanother based on a novel generic 3D reconstruction loss, to augment\ntemplate-deformation algorithms such that the surface meshes directly come with\nan atlas-based brain parcellation. By combining both options with two of the\nlatest cortical surface reconstruction algorithms, we attain highly accurate\nparcellations with a Dice score of 90.2 (graph classification branch) and 90.4\n(novel reconstruction loss) together with state-of-the-art surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Portfolio management is a fundamental problem in finance. It involves\nperiodic reallocations of assets to maximize the expected returns within an\nappropriate level of risk exposure. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been\nconsidered a promising approach to solving this problem owing to its strong\ncapability in sequential decision making. However, due to the non-stationary\nnature of financial markets, applying RL techniques to portfolio optimization\nremains a challenging problem. Extracting trading knowledge from various expert\nstrategies could be helpful for agents to accommodate the changing markets. In\nthis paper, we propose MetaTrader, a novel two-stage RL-based approach for\nportfolio management, which learns to integrate diverse trading policies to\nadapt to various market conditions. In the first stage, MetaTrader incorporates\nan imitation learning objective into the reinforcement learning framework.\nThrough imitating different expert demonstrations, MetaTrader acquires a set of\ntrading policies with great diversity. In the second stage, MetaTrader learns a\nmeta-policy to recognize the market conditions and decide on the most proper\nlearned policy to follow. We evaluate the proposed approach on three real-world\nindex datasets and compare it to state-of-the-art baselines. The empirical\nresults demonstrate that MetaTrader significantly outperforms those baselines\nin balancing profits and risks. Furthermore, thorough ablation studies validate\nthe effectiveness of the components in the proposed approach.",

We instead frame molecular docking as a\ngenerative modeling problem and develop DiffDock, a diffusion generative model\nover the non-Euclidean manifold of ligand poses. To do so, we map this manifold\nto the product space of the degrees of freedom (translational, rotational, and\ntorsional) involved in docking and develop an efficient diffusion process on\nthis space. Empirically, DiffDock obtains a 38% top-1 success rate (RMSD<2A) on\nPDBBind, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art of\ntraditional docking (23%) and deep learning (20%) methods.
