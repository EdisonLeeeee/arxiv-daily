    "abstract": "Speech pre-training has primarily demonstrated efficacy on classification\ntasks, while its capability of generating novel speech, similar to how GPT-2\ncan generate coherent paragraphs, has barely been explored. Generative Spoken\nLanguage Modeling (GSLM) (Lakhotia et al., 2021) is the only prior work\naddressing the generative aspects of speech pre-training, which replaces text\nwith discovered phone-like units for language modeling and shows the ability to\ngenerate meaningful novel sentences. Unfortunately, despite eliminating the\nneed of text, the units used in GSLM discard most of the prosodic information.\nHence, GSLM fails to leverage prosody for better comprehension, and does not\ngenerate expressive speech. In this work, we present a prosody-aware generative\nspoken language model (pGSLM). It is composed of a multi-stream transformer\nlanguage model (MS-TLM) of speech, represented as discovered unit and prosodic\nfeature streams, and an adapted HiFi-GAN model converting MS-TLM outputs to\nwaveforms. We devise a series of metrics for prosody modeling and generation,\nand re-use metrics from GSLM for content modeling. Experimental results show\nthat the pGSLM can utilize prosody to improve both prosody and content\nmodeling, and also generate natural, meaningful, and coherent speech given a\nspoken prompt.

In this paper to achieve infinite\nstiffness magnetic field has been created by passing current, the input of the\nelectromagnet is the output voltage of the sensor.

The current moves through the electromagnet\nwhich creates magnetic force. If the load increases the proximity sensor senses\nthe distance and delivers signal to the controller circuit. After receiving the\nsignal controller circuit increased current supply to the electromagnet through\npower amplifier circuit. Magnetic force is expanded then, and object is\nlevitated in a stable position. If the load is decreased the proximity sensor\nsenses the distance and delivers signal to the controller circuit. Controller\ncircuit receives the signal and decreases current supply to the electromagnet\nthrough power amplifier circuit.

For generative dialogue models, being trained on real human\nconversations containing unbalanced gender and race/ethnicity references can\nlead to models that display learned biases, which we define here broadly as any\nmeasurable differences in the distributions of words or semantic content of\nconversations based on demographic groups. We measure the strength of such\nbiases by producing artificial conversations between two copies of a dialogue\nmodel, conditioning one conversational partner to state a name commonly\nassociated with a certain gender and/or race/ethnicity. We find that larger\ncapacity models tend to exhibit more gender bias and greater stereotyping of\noccupations by gender. We show that several methods of tuning these dialogue\nmodels, specifically name scrambling, controlled generation, and unlikelihood\ntraining, are effective in reducing bias in conversation, including on a\ndownstream conversational task. Name scrambling is also effective in lowering\ndifferences in token usage across conversations where partners have names\nassociated with different genders or races/ethnicities.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of Industry 4.0 is making production systems more flexible and\nalso more dynamic. In these settings, schedules often need to be adapted in\nreal-time by dispatching rules. Although substantial progress was made until\nthe '90s, the performance of these rules is still rather limited. The machine\nlearning literature is developing a variety of methods to improve them, but the\nresulting rules are difficult to interpret and do not generalise well for a\nwide range of settings. This paper is the first major attempt at combining\nmachine learning with domain problem reasoning for scheduling. The idea\nconsists of using the insights obtained with the latter to guide the empirical\nsearch of the former. Our hypothesis is that this guided empirical learning\nprocess should result in dispatching rules that are effective and interpretable\nand which generalise well to different instance classes. We test our approach\nin the classical dynamic job shop scheduling problem minimising tardiness,\nwhich is one of the most well-studied scheduling problems. Nonetheless, results\nsuggest that our approach was able to find new state-of-the-art rules, which\nsignificantly outperform the existing literature in the vast majority of\nsettings, from loose to tight due dates and from low utilisation conditions to\ncongested shops.

    "title": "DexRay: A Simple, yet Effective Deep Learning Approach to Android  Malware Detection based on Image Representation of Bytecode",
    "abstract": "Computer vision has witnessed several advances in recent years, with\nunprecedented performance provided by deep representation learning research.\nImage formats thus appear attractive to other fields such as malware detection,\nwhere deep learning on images alleviates the need for comprehensively\nhand-crafted features generalising to different malware variants. We postulate\nthat this research direction could become the next frontier in Android malware\ndetection, and therefore requires a clear roadmap to ensure that new approaches\nindeed bring novel contributions. We contribute with a first building block by\ndeveloping and assessing a baseline pipeline for image-based malware detection\nwith straightforward steps. We propose DexRay, which converts the bytecode of\nthe app DEX files into grey-scale \"vector\" images and feeds them to a\n1-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network model. We view DexRay as\nfoundational due to the exceedingly basic nature of the design choices,\nallowing to infer what could be a minimal performance that can be obtained with\nimage-based learning in malware detection. The performance of DexRay evaluated\non over 158k apps demonstrates that, while simple, our approach is effective\nwith a high detection rate(F1-score= 0.96). Finally, we investigate the impact\nof time decay and image-resizing on the performance of DexRay and assess its\nresilience to obfuscation. This work-in-progress paper contributes to the\ndomain of Deep Learning based Malware detection by providing a sound, simple,\nyet effective approach (with available artefacts) that can be the basis to\nscope the many profound questions that will need to be investigated to fully\ndevelop this domain.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have developed rapidly and have achieved outstanding\nperformance in several tasks, such as image classification and natural language\nprocessing. However, recent studies have indicated that both digital and\nphysical adversarial examples can fool neural networks. Face-recognition\nsystems are used in various applications that involve security threats from\nphysical adversarial examples. Herein, we propose a physical adversarial attack\nwith the use of full-face makeup. The presence of makeup on the human face is a\nreasonable possibility, which possibly increases the imperceptibility of\nattacks. In our attack framework, we combine the cycle-adversarial generative\nnetwork (cycle-GAN) and a victimized classifier. The Cycle-GAN is used to\ngenerate adversarial makeup, and the architecture of the victimized classifier\nis VGG 16. Our experimental results show that our attack can effectively\novercome manual errors in makeup application, such as color and\nposition-related errors. We also demonstrate that the approaches used to train\nthe models can influence physical attacks; the adversarial perturbations\ncrafted from the pre-trained model are affected by the corresponding training\ndata.",

    "abstract": "Model-based approaches to the verification of non-terminating Cyber-Physical\nSystems (CPSs) usually rely on numerical simulation of the System Under\nVerification (SUV) model under input scenarios of possibly varying duration,\nchosen among those satisfying given constraints. Such constraints typically\nstem from requirements (or assumptions) on the SUV inputs and its operational\nenvironment as well as from the enforcement of additional conditions aiming at,\ne.g., prioritising the (often extremely long) verification activity, by, e.g.,\nfocusing on scenarios explicitly exercising selected requirements, or avoiding\nvacuity in their satisfaction. In this setting, the possibility to efficiently\nsample at random (with a known distribution, e.g., uniformly) within, or to\nefficiently enumerate (possibly in a uniformly random order) scenarios among\nthose satisfying the given constraints is a key enabler for the viability of\nthe verification process, e.g., via simulation-based statistical model\nchecking. Unfortunately, in case of non-trivial combinations of constraints,\niterative approaches like Markovian random walks in the space of sequences of\ninputs in general fail in extracting scenarios according to a given\ndistribution, and can be very inefficient to produce legal scenarios of\ninterest. We show how, given a set of constraints on the input scenarios\nsuccinctly defined by finite memory monitors, a data structure (scenario\ngenerator) can be synthesised, from which any-horizon scenarios satisfying the\ninput constraints can be efficiently extracted by (possibly uniform) random\nsampling or (randomised) enumeration. Our approach enables seamless support to\nvirtually all simulation-based approaches to CPS verification, ranging from\nsimple random testing to statistical model checking and formal (i.e.,\nexhaustive) verification.",

To address this, we construct a large corpus\nof 126k domain-expert (science teacher) relevance ratings that augment a corpus\nof explanations to standardized science exam questions, discovering 80k\nadditional relevant facts not rated as gold. We build three strong models based\non different methodologies (generation, ranking, and schemas), and empirically\nshow that while expert-augmented ratings provide better estimates of\nexplanation quality, both original (gold) and expert-augmented automatic\nevaluations still substantially underestimate performance by up to 36% when\ncompared with full manual expert judgements, with different models being\ndisproportionately affected.

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition (ER) from facial images is one of the landmark tasks in\naffective computing with major developments in the last decade. Initial efforts\non ER relied on handcrafted features that were used to characterize facial\nimages and then feed to standard predictive models. Recent methodologies\ncomprise end-to-end trainable deep learning methods that simultaneously learn\nboth, features and predictive model. Perhaps the most successful models are\nbased on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While these models have excelled\nat this task, they still fail at capturing local patterns that could emerge in\nthe learning process. We hypothesize these patterns could be captured by\nvariants based on locally weighted learning. Specifically, in this paper we\npropose a CNN based architecture enhanced with multiple branches formed by\nradial basis function (RBF) units that aims at exploiting local information at\nthe final stage of the learning process. Intuitively, these RBF units capture\nlocal patterns shared by similar instances using an intermediate\nrepresentation, then the outputs of the RBFs are feed to a softmax layer that\nexploits this information to improve the predictive performance of the model.\nThis feature could be particularly advantageous in ER as cultural / ethnicity\ndifferences may be identified by the local units. We evaluate the proposed\nmethod in several ER datasets and show the proposed methodology achieves\nstate-of-the-art in some of them, even when we adopt a pre-trained VGG-Face\nmodel as backbone.

Our\nfirst contribution is to show that estimation using common robust costs, such\nas truncated least squares (TLS), maximum consensus, Geman-McClure, Tukey's\nbiweight, among others, can be reformulated as polynomial optimization problems\n(POPs). By focusing on the TLS cost, our second contribution is to exploit\nsparsity in the POP and propose a sparse semidefinite programming (SDP)\nrelaxation that is much smaller than the standard Lasserre's hierarchy while\npreserving exactness, i.e., the SDP recovers the optimizer of the nonconvex POP\nwith an optimality certificate. Our third contribution is to solve the SDP\nrelaxations at an unprecedented scale and accuracy by presenting STRIDE, a\nsolver that blends global descent on the convex SDP with fast local search on\nthe nonconvex POP. Our fourth contribution is an evaluation of the proposed\nframework on six geometric perception problems including single and multiple\nrotation averaging, point cloud and mesh registration, absolute pose\nestimation, and category-level object pose and shape estimation. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that (i) our sparse SDP relaxation is exact with up to\n60%-90% outliers across applications; (ii) while still being far from\nreal-time, STRIDE is up to 100 times faster than existing SDP solvers on\nmedium-scale problems, and is the only solver that can solve large-scale SDPs\nwith hundreds of thousands of constraints to high accuracy; (iii) STRIDE\nprovides a safeguard to existing fast heuristics for robust estimation (e.g.,\nRANSAC or Graduated Non-Convexity), i.e., it certifies global optimality if the\nheuristic estimates are optimal, or detects and allows escaping local optima\nwhen the heuristic estimates are suboptimal.",

    "abstract": "In-storage computing with modern solid-state drives (SSDs) enables developers\nto offload programs from the host to the SSD. It has been proven to be an\neffective approach to alleviate the I/O bottleneck. To facilitate in-storage\ncomputing, many frameworks have been proposed. However, few of them treat the\nin-storage security as the first citizen. Specifically, since modern SSD\ncontrollers do not have a trusted execution environment, an offloaded\n(malicious) program could steal, modify, and even destroy the data stored in\nthe SSD. In this paper, we first investigate the attacks that could be\nconducted by offloaded in-storage programs. To defend against these attacks, we\nbuild a lightweight trusted execution environment, named IceClave for\nin-storage computing. IceClave enables security isolation between in-storage\nprograms and flash management functions that include flash address translation,\ndata access control, and garbage collection, with TrustZone extensions.\nIceClave also achieves security isolation between in-storage programs by\nenforcing memory integrity verification of in-storage DRAM with low overhead.\nTo protect data loaded from flash chips, IceClave develops a lightweight data\nencryption/decryption mechanism in flash controllers. We develop IceClave with\na full system simulator. We evaluate IceClave with a variety of data-intensive\napplications such as databases. Compared to state-of-the-art in-storage\ncomputing approaches, IceClave introduces only 7.6% performance overhead, while\nenforcing security isolation in the SSD controller with minimal hardware cost.\nIceClave still keeps the performance benefit of in-storage computing by\ndelivering up to 2.31$\\times$ better performance than the conventional\nhost-based trusted computing approach.",

    "abstract": "Inverse kinematics (IK) is the problem of finding robot joint configurations\nthat satisfy constraints on the position or pose of one or more end-effectors.\nFor robots with redundant degrees of freedom, there is often an infinite,\nnonconvex set of solutions. The IK problem is further complicated when\ncollision avoidance constraints are imposed by obstacles in the workspace. In\ngeneral, closed-form expressions yielding feasible configurations do not exist,\nmotivating the use of numerical solution methods. However, these approaches\nrely on local optimization of nonconvex problems, often requiring an accurate\ninitialization or numerous re-initializations to converge to a valid solution.\nIn this work, we first formulate complicated inverse kinematics problems as\nconvex feasibility problems whose low-rank feasible points provide exact IK\nsolutions. We then present CIDGIK (Convex Iteration for Distance-Geometric\nInverse Kinematics), an algorithm that solves these feasibility problems with a\nsequence of semidefinite programs whose objectives are designed to encourage\nlow-rank minimizers. Our problem formulation elegantly unifies the\nconfiguration space and workspace constraints of a robot: intrinsic robot\ngeometry and obstacle avoidance are both expressed as simple linear matrix\nequations and inequalities. Our experimental results for a variety of popular\nmanipulator models demonstrate faster and more accurate convergence than a\nconventional nonlinear optimization-based approach, especially in environments\nwith many obstacles.",

    "abstract": "Online action detection, which aims to identify an ongoing action from a\nstreaming video, is an important subject in real-world applications. For this\ntask, previous methods use recurrent neural networks for modeling temporal\nrelations in an input sequence. However, these methods overlook the fact that\nthe input image sequence includes not only the action of interest but\nbackground and irrelevant actions. This would induce recurrent units to\naccumulate unnecessary information for encoding features on the action of\ninterest. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel recurrent unit, named\nInformation Discrimination Unit (IDU), which explicitly discriminates the\ninformation relevancy between an ongoing action and others to decide whether to\naccumulate the input information. This enables learning more discriminative\nrepresentations for identifying an ongoing action. In this paper, we further\npresent a new recurrent unit, called Information Integration Unit (IIU), for\naction anticipation. Our IIU exploits the outputs from IDU as pseudo action\nlabels as well as RGB frames to learn enriched features of observed actions\neffectively. In experiments on TVSeries and THUMOS-14, the proposed methods\noutperform state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in online action\ndetection and action anticipation.

    "abstract": "Existing question answering (QA) datasets are created mainly for the\napplication of having AI to be able to answer questions asked by humans. But in\neducational applications, teachers and parents sometimes may not know what\nquestions they should ask a child that can maximize their language learning\nresults. With a newly released book QA dataset (FairytaleQA), which educational\nexperts labeled on 46 fairytale storybooks for early childhood readers, we\ndeveloped an automated QA generation model architecture for this novel\napplication. Our model (1) extracts candidate answers from a given storybook\npassage through carefully designed heuristics based on a pedagogical framework;\n(2) generates appropriate questions corresponding to each extracted answer\nusing a language model; and, (3) uses another QA model to rank top QA-pairs.\nAutomatic and human evaluations show that our model outperforms baselines. We\nalso demonstrate that our method can help with the scarcity issue of the\nchildren's book QA dataset via data augmentation on 200 unlabeled storybooks.",

    "abstract": "We present a new algorithm, the efficient jet marching method (EJM), for\ncomputing the quasipotential and its gradient for two-dimensional SDEs. The\nquasipotential is a potential-like function for nongradient SDEs that gives\nasymptotic estimates for the invariant probability measure, expected escape\ntimes from basins of attractors, and maximum likelihood escape paths. The\nquasipotential is a solution to an optimal control problem with an anisotropic\ncost function which can be solved for numerically via Dijkstra-like\nlabel-setting methods. Previous Dijkstra-like quasipotential solvers have\ndisplayed in general 1st order accuracy in the mesh spacing. However, by\nutilizing higher order interpolations of the quasipotential as well as more\naccurate approximations of the minimum action paths (MAPs), EJM achieves\nsecond-order accuracy for the quasipotential and nearly second-order for its\ngradient. Moreover, by using targeted search neighborhoods for the fastest\ncharacteristics following the ideas of Mirebeau, EJM also enjoys a reduction in\ncomputation time. This highly accurate solver enables us to compute the\nprefactor for the WKB approximation for the invariant probability measure and\nthe Bouchet-Reygner sharp estimate for the expected escape time for the\nMaier-Stein SDE.",

    "abstract": "Conventional RGB-D salient object detection methods aim to leverage depth as\ncomplementary information to find the salient regions in both modalities.\nHowever, the salient object detection results heavily rely on the quality of\ncaptured depth data which sometimes are unavailable. In this work, we make the\nfirst attempt to solve the RGB-D salient object detection problem with a novel\ndepth-awareness framework. This framework only relies on RGB data in the\ntesting phase, utilizing captured depth data as supervision for representation\nlearning. To construct our framework as well as achieving accurate salient\ndetection results, we propose a Ubiquitous Target Awareness (UTA) network to\nsolve three important challenges in RGB-D SOD task: 1) a depth awareness module\nto excavate depth information and to mine ambiguous regions via adaptive\ndepth-error weights, 2) a spatial-aware cross-modal interaction and a\nchannel-aware cross-level interaction, exploiting the low-level boundary cues\nand amplifying high-level salient channels, and 3) a gated multi-scale\npredictor module to perceive the object saliency in different contextual\nscales. Besides its high performance, our proposed UTA network is depth-free\nfor inference and runs in real-time with 43 FPS. Experimental evidence\ndemonstrates that our proposed network not only surpasses the state-of-the-art\nmethods on five public RGB-D SOD benchmarks by a large margin, but also\nverifies its extensibility on five public RGB SOD benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Due to the large success in object detection and instance segmentation, Mask\nR-CNN attracts great attention and is widely adopted as a strong baseline for\narbitrary-shaped scene text detection and spotting. However, two issues remain\nto be settled. The first is dense text case, which is easy to be neglected but\nquite practical. There may exist multiple instances in one proposal, which\nmakes it difficult for the mask head to distinguish different instances and\ndegrades the performance. In this work, we argue that the performance\ndegradation results from the learning confusion issue in the mask head. We\npropose to use an MLP decoder instead of the \"deconv-conv\" decoder in the mask\nhead, which alleviates the issue and promotes robustness significantly. And we\npropose instance-aware mask learning in which the mask head learns to predict\nthe shape of the whole instance rather than classify each pixel to text or\nnon-text. With instance-aware mask learning, the mask branch can learn\nseparated and compact masks. The second is that due to large variations in\nscale and aspect ratio, RPN needs complicated anchor settings, making it hard\nto maintain and transfer across different datasets. To settle this issue, we\npropose an adaptive label assignment in which all instances especially those\nwith extreme aspect ratios are guaranteed to be associated with enough anchors.\nEquipped with these components, the proposed method named MAYOR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks including DAST1500, MSRA-TD500,\nICDAR2015, CTW1500, and Total-Text.",

In this paper, we generalize VSAs to function\nspaces by mapping continuous-valued data into a vector space such that the\ninner product between the representations of any two data points represents a\nsimilarity kernel. By analogy to VSA, we call this new function encoding and\ncomputing framework Vector Function Architecture (VFA). In VFAs, vectors can\nrepresent individual data points as well as elements of a function space (a\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space). The algebraic vector operations, inherited\nfrom VSA, correspond to well-defined operations in function space. Furthermore,\nwe study a previously proposed method for encoding continuous data, fractional\npower encoding (FPE), which uses exponentiation of a random base vector to\nproduce randomized representations of data points and fulfills the kernel\nproperties for inducing a VFA. We show that the distribution from which\nelements of the base vector are sampled determines the shape of the FPE kernel,\nwhich in turn induces a VFA for computing with band-limited functions. In\nparticular, VFAs provide an algebraic framework for implementing large-scale\nkernel machines with random features, extending Rahimi and Recht, 2007.\nFinally, we demonstrate several applications of VFA models to problems in image\nrecognition, density estimation and nonlinear regression. Our analyses and\nresults suggest that VFAs constitute a powerful new framework for representing\nand manipulating functions in distributed neural systems, with myriad\napplications in artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Accurately forecasting ridesourcing demand is important for effective\ntransportation planning and policy-making. With the rise of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), researchers have started to utilize machine learning models\nto forecast travel demand, which, in many cases, can produce higher prediction\naccuracy than statistical models. However, most existing machine-learning\nstudies used a global model to predict the demand and ignored the influence of\nspatial heterogeneity (i.e., the spatial variations in the impacts of\nexplanatory variables). Spatial heterogeneity can drive the parameter\nestimations varying over space; failing to consider the spatial variations may\nlimit the model's prediction performance. To account for spatial heterogeneity,\nthis study proposes a Clustering-aided Ensemble Method (CEM) to forecast the\nzone-to-zone (census-tract-to-census-tract) travel demand for ridesourcing\nservices. Specifically, we develop a clustering framework to split the\norigin-destination pairs into different clusters and ensemble the\ncluster-specific machine learning models for prediction. We implement and test\nthe proposed methodology by using the ridesourcing-trip data in Chicago. The\nresults show that, with a more transparent and flexible model structure, the\nCEM significantly improves the prediction accuracy than the benchmark models\n(i.e., global machine-learning and statistical models directly trained on all\nobservations).

The\ndesign is based on the idea of prioritizing the use of IBRs over conventional\ngenerator-based control in compensating for sudden and unpredicted changes in\nloads and generations, and thereby mitigate any undesired dynamics in the\nfrequency or the voltage by exploiting their fast actuation time constants. A\nnew sequential optimization problem, referred to as Area Prioritized Power Flow\n(APPF), is formulated to model this prioritization. It is shown that compared\nto conventional power flow APPF not only leads to a fairer balance between the\ndispatch of active and reactive power from the IBRs and the synchronous\ngenerators, but also limits the impact of any contingency from spreading out\nbeyond its respective control area, thereby guaranteeing a better collective\ndynamic performance of the grid. This improvement, however, comes at the cost\nof adding an extra layer of communication needed for executing APPF in a\nhierarchical way. Results are validated using simulations of a 9-machine,\n6-IBR, 33-bus, 3-area power system model, illustrating how APPF can mitigate a\ndisturbance faster and more efficiently by prioritizing the use of local\narea-resources.",

Recently, Relaxed\nRanking Distillation (RRD) has shown that distilling the ranking information in\nthe recommendation list significantly improves the performance. However, the\nmethod still has limitations in that 1) it does not fully utilize the\nprediction errors of the student model, which makes the training not fully\nefficient, and 2) it only distills the user-side ranking information, which\nprovides an insufficient view under the sparse implicit feedback. This paper\npresents Dual Correction strategy for Distillation (DCD), which transfers the\nranking information from the teacher model to the student model in a more\nefficient manner. Most importantly, DCD uses the discrepancy between the\nteacher model and the student model predictions to decide which knowledge to be\ndistilled. By doing so, DCD essentially provides the learning guidance tailored\nto \"correcting\" what the student model has failed to accurately predict. This\nprocess is applied for transferring the ranking information from the user-side\nas well as the item-side to address sparse implicit user feedback.

Beside the quality and rich sensor\nsetup, its success is also due to the online evaluation tool, which enables\nresearchers to benchmark and compare algorithms. The results are evaluated on\nthe test subset solely, without any knowledge about the ground truth, yielding\nunbiased, overfit free and therefore relevant validation for robot localization\nbased on cameras, 3D laser or combination of both. However, as any sensor\nsetup, it requires prior calibration and rectified stereo images are provided,\nintroducing dependence on the default calibration parameters. Given that, a\nnatural question arises if a better set of calibration parameters can be found\nthat would yield higher odometry accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new\napproach for one shot calibration of the KITTI dataset multiple camera setup.\nThe approach yields better calibration parameters, both in the sense of lower\ncalibration reprojection errors and lower visual odometry error. We conducted\nexperiments where we show for three different odometry algorithms, namely\nSOFT2, ORB-SLAM2 and VISO2, that odometry accuracy is significantly improved\nwith the proposed calibration parameters. Moreover, our odometry, SOFT2, in\nconjunction with the proposed calibration method achieved the highest accuracy\non the official KITTI scoreboard with 0.53% translational and 0.0009 deg/m\nrotational error, outperforming even 3D laser-based methods.",

    "title": "Level Set Binocular Stereo with Occlusions",
    "abstract": "Localizing stereo boundaries and predicting nearby disparities are difficult\nbecause stereo boundaries induce occluded regions where matching cues are\nabsent. Most modern computer vision algorithms treat occlusions secondarily\n(e.g., via left-right consistency checks after matching) or rely on high-level\ncues to improve nearby disparities (e.g., via deep networks and large training\nsets). They ignore the geometry of stereo occlusions, which dictates that the\nspatial extent of occlusion must equal the amplitude of the disparity jump that\ncauses it. This paper introduces an energy and level-set optimizer that\nimproves boundaries by encoding occlusion geometry. Our model applies to\ntwo-layer, figure-ground scenes, and it can be implemented cooperatively using\nmessages that pass predominantly between parents and children in an undecimated\nhierarchy of multi-scale image patches. In a small collection of figure-ground\nscenes curated from Middlebury and Falling Things stereo datasets, our model\nprovides more accurate boundaries than previous occlusion-handling stereo\ntechniques. This suggests new directions for creating cooperative stereo\nsystems that incorporate occlusion cues in a human-like manner.",

Thus, it is crucial\nfor the logistics industry on how to assign a candidate logistics route for\neach shipping parcel properly as it leaves a significant impact on the total\nlogistics cost optimization and business constraints satisfaction such as\ntransit hub capacity and delivery proportion of delivery providers. This online\nroute-assignment problem can be viewed as a constrained online decision-making\nproblem. Notably, the large amount (beyond ${10^5}$) of daily parcels, the\nvariability and non-Markovian characteristics of parcel information impose\ndifficulties on attaining (near-) optimal solution without violating\nconstraints excessively. In this paper, we develop a model-free DRL approach\nnamed PPO-RA, in which Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is improved with\ndedicated techniques to address the challenges for route assignment (RA). The\nactor and critic networks use attention mechanism and parameter sharing to\naccommodate each incoming parcel with varying numbers and identities of\ncandidate routes, without modeling non-Markovian parcel arriving dynamics since\nwe make assumption of i.i.d. parcel arrival. We use recorded delivery parcel\ndata to evaluate the performance of PPO-RA by comparing it with widely-used\nbaselines via simulation.

In cases where only a small\nproportion of the data is missing, those missing values can often be imputed.\nIn cases of large proportions of missing data, imputing is often not feasible,\nand removing observations containing missing values is often the only option.\nThis paper presents a technique, that allows to utilize all of the available\ndata without the need of removing large amounts of observations where data is\nonly partially available.

In the video\nview, we adopt a segmented timeline and highlight high-risk periods that may\ncontain deviant information. In the frame view, we present a novel visual\nsummarization method that combines risk-aware features and video context to\nenable quick video navigation. In the audio view, we employ a storyline-based\ndesign to provide a multi-faceted overview which can be used to explore audio\ncontent.

Hence\nbeing able to calibrate these models, or enforce calibration while learning\nthem, has regained interest in recent literature. In this context, properly\nassessing calibration is paramount to quantify new contributions tackling\ncalibration.

Thus this\npaper focuses on the empirical evaluation of calibration metrics in the context\nof classification.

The use of local\ninformation for feature extraction and matching is still necessary.

The intra-part module creates\nlocal relations with mask-guided features, while the inter-part relationship\nbuilds correlations with transformers, to develop cross relationships between\npart nodes.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of Low-power Wide Area Networks\n(LPWANs) in the unlicensed band for various Internet-of-Things (IoT)\napplications. Due to the ultra-low transmission power and long transmission\nduration, LPWAN devices inevitably suffer from high power Cross Technology\nInterference (CTI), such as interference from Wi-Fi, coexisting in the same\nspectrum. To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces the Partial Symbol\nRecovery (PSR) scheme for improving the CTI resilience of LPWAN. We verify our\nidea on LoRa, a widely adopted LPWAN technique, as a proof of concept. At the\nPHY layer, although CTI has much higher power, its duration is relatively\nshorter compared with LoRa symbols, leaving part of a LoRa symbol uncorrupted.\nMoreover, due to its high redundancy, LoRa chips within a symbol are highly\ncorrelated. This opens the possibility of detecting a LoRa symbol with only\npart of the chips. By examining the unique frequency patterns in LoRa symbols\nwith time-frequency analysis, our design effectively detects the clean LoRa\nchips that are free of CTI. This enables PSR to only rely on clean LoRa chips\nfor successfully recovering from communication failures. We evaluate our PSR\ndesign with real-world testbeds, including SX1280 LoRa chips and USRP B210,\nunder Wi-Fi interference in various scenarios. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our design offers reliable packet recovery performance,\nsuccessfully boosting the LoRa packet reception ratio from 45.2% to 82.2% with\na performance gain of 1.8 times.",

Physical unclonable function (PUF) as a promising hardware\nprimitive has been intensively studied for information security. However, the\nwidely investigated silicon PUF with low entropy is vulnerable to various\nattacks. Herein, we introduce a concept of bionic optical PUFs inspired from\nunique biological architectures, and fabricate four types of bionic PUFs by\nmolding the surface micro-nano structures of natural plant tissues with a\nsimple, low-cost, green and environmentally friendly manufacturing process. The\nlaser speckle responses of all bionic PUFs are statistically demonstrated to be\nrandom, unique, unpredictable and robust enough for cryptographic applications,\nindicating the broad applicability of bionic PUFs. On this ground, the\nfeasibility of implementing bionic PUFs as cryptographic primitives in entity\nauthentication and encrypted communication is experimentally validated, which\nshows its promising potential in the application of future information\nsecurity.",

    "abstract": "In the past years, significant improvements in the field of neural\narchitecture search(NAS) have been made. However, it is still challenging to\nsearch for efficient networks due to the gap between the searched constraint\nand real inference time exists. To search for a high-performance network with\nlow inference time, several previous works set a computational complexity\nconstraint for the search algorithm. However, many factors affect the speed of\ninference(e.g., FLOPs, MACs). The correlation between a single indicator and\nthe latency is not strong. Currently, some re-parameterization(Rep) techniques\nare proposed to convert multi-branch to single-path architecture which is\ninference-friendly. Nevertheless, multi-branch architectures are still\nhuman-defined and inefficient. In this work, we propose a new search space that\nis suitable for structural re-parameterization techniques. RepNAS, a one-stage\nNAS approach, is present to efficiently search the optimal diverse branch\nblock(ODBB) for each layer under the branch number constraint.

However, it is still challenging to\nstrike a good balance between accuracy and efficiency while quantizing DNN\nweights or activation values from high-precision formats to their quantized\ncounterparts. We propose a new method called elastic significant bit\nquantization (ESB) that controls the number of significant bits of quantized\nvalues to obtain better inference accuracy with fewer resources. We design a\nunified mathematical formula to constrain the quantized values of the ESB with\na flexible number of significant bits. We also introduce a distribution\ndifference aligner (DDA) to quantitatively align the distributions between the\nfull-precision weight or activation values and quantized values. Consequently,\nESB is suitable for various bell-shaped distributions of weights and activation\nof DNNs, thus maintaining a high inference accuracy. Benefitting from fewer\nsignificant bits of quantized values, ESB can reduce the multiplication\ncomplexity. We implement ESB as an accelerator and quantitatively evaluate its\nefficiency on FPGAs. Extensive experimental results illustrate that ESB\nquantization consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves\naverage accuracy improvements of 4.78%, 1.92%, and 3.56% over AlexNet,\nResNet18, and MobileNetV2, respectively.

If $r$ is not computed adaptively as in rational\nKrylov methods, this is usually done using the partial fraction expansion of\n$r$ and solving linear systems with matrices $A- \\tau I$ for the various poles\n$\\tau$ of $r$. Here we investigate an alternative approach for the case that a\ncontinued fraction representation for the rational function is known rather\nthan a partial fraction expansion. This is typically the case, for example, for\nPad\\'e approximations. From the continued fraction, we first construct a matrix\npencil from which we then obtain what we call the CF-matrix (continued fraction\nmatrix), a block tridiagonal matrix whose blocks consist of polynomials of $A$\nwith degree bounded by 1 for many continued fractions. We show that one can\nevaluate $r(A)v$ by solving a single linear system with the CF-matrix and\npresent a number of first theoretical results as a basis for an analysis of\nfuture, specific solution methods for the large linear system. While the\nCF-matrix approach is of principal interest on its own as a new way to compute\n$f(A)v$, it can in particular be beneficial when a partial fraction expansion\nis not known beforehand and computing its parameters is ill-conditioned.

    "abstract": "Pre-training language models (LMs) on large-scale unlabeled text data makes\nthe model much easier to achieve exceptional downstream performance than their\ncounterparts directly trained on the downstream tasks. In this work, we study\nwhat specific traits in the pre-training data, other than the semantics, make a\npre-trained LM superior to their counterparts trained from scratch on\ndownstream tasks. We propose to use artificially constructed datasets as the\npre-training data to exclude the effect of semantics, and further control what\ncharacteristics the pre-training corpora have. By fine-tuning the pre-trained\nmodels on GLUE benchmark, we can learn how beneficial it is to transfer the\nknowledge from the model trained on the dataset possessing that specific trait.\nWe define and discuss three different characteristics in the artificial\ndataset: 1) matching the token's uni-gram or bi-gram distribution between\npre-training and downstream fine-tuning, 2) the presence of the explicit\ndependencies among the tokens in a sequence, 3) the length of the implicit\ndependencies among the tokens in a sequence. Our experiments show that the\nexplicit dependencies in the sequences of the pre-training data are critical to\nthe downstream performance. Our results also reveal that models achieve better\ndownstream performance when pre-trained on a dataset with a longer range of\nimplicit dependencies. Based on our analysis, we find that models pre-trained\nwith artificial datasets are prone to learn spurious correlation in downstream\ntasks. Our work reveals that even if the LMs are not pre-trained on natural\nlanguage, they still gain transferability on certain human language downstream\ntasks once the LMs learn to model the token dependencies in the sequences.

Following a carefully constrained set of Deezer users over a 2-year\nobservation period, our work explores factors driving user behaviour in the\nbroad sense, by differentiating users on the basis of their temporal daily\nusage, adoption of the main platform affordances, and the ways in which they\nreact to them, especially in terms of recommendation adoption.

    "title": "Do What Nature Did To Us: Evolving Plastic Recurrent Neural Networks For  Task Generalization",
    "abstract": "While artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been widely adopted in machine\nlearning, researchers are increasingly obsessed by the gaps between ANNs and\nbiological neural networks (BNNs). In this paper, we propose a framework named\nas Evolutionary Plastic Recurrent Neural Networks} (EPRNN). Inspired by BNN,\nEPRNN composes Evolution Strategies, Plasticity Rules, and Recursion-based\nLearning all in one meta learning framework for generalization to different\ntasks. More specifically, EPRNN incorporates with nested loops for meta\nlearning -- an outer loop searches for optimal initial parameters of the neural\nnetwork and learning rules; an inner loop adapts to specific tasks. In the\ninner loop of EPRNN, we effectively attain both long term memory and short term\nmemory by forging plasticity with recursion-based learning mechanisms, both of\nwhich are believed to be responsible for memristance in BNNs. The inner-loop\nsetting closely simulate that of BNNs, which neither query from any gradient\noracle for optimization nor require the exact forms of learning objectives. To\nevaluate the performance of EPRNN, we carry out extensive experiments in two\ngroups of tasks: Sequence Predicting, and Wheeled Robot Navigating. The\nexperiment results demonstrate the unique advantage of EPRNN compared to\nstate-of-the-arts based on plasticity and recursion while yielding comparably\ngood performance against deep learning based approaches in the tasks. The\nexperiment results suggest the potential of EPRNN to generalize to variety of\ntasks and encourage more efforts in plasticity and recursion based learning\nmechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Static bug localization techniques that locate bugs at method granularity\nhave gained much attention from both researchers and practitioners. For a\nstatic method-level bug localization technique, a key but challenging step is\nto fully retrieve the semantics of methods and bug reports. Currently, existing\nstudies mainly use the same bag-of-word space to represent the semantics of\nmethods and bug reports without considering structure information of methods\nand textual contexts of bug reports, which largely and negatively affects bug\nlocalization performance.\nTo address this problem, we develop BLESER, a new bug localization technique\nbased on enhanced semantic retrieval. Specifically, we use an AST-based code\nembedding model (capturing code structure better) to retrieve the semantics of\nmethods, and word embedding models (capturing textual contexts better) to\nrepresent the semantics of bug reports. Then, a deep learning model is built on\nthe enhanced semantic representations. During model building, we compare five\ntypical word embedding models in representing bug reports and try to explore\nthe usefulness of re-sampling strategies and cost-sensitive strategies in\nhandling class imbalance problems. We evaluate our BLESER on five Java projects\nfrom the Defects4J dataset. We find that: (1) On the whole, the word embedding\nmodel ELMo outperformed the other four models (including word2vec, BERT, etc.)\nin facilitating bug localization techniques. (2) Among four strategies aiming\nat solving class imbalance problems, the strategy ROS (random over-sampling)\nperformed much better than the other three strategies (including random\nunder-sampling, Focal Loss, etc.). (3) By integrating ELMo and ROS into BLESER,\nat method-level bug localization, we could achieve MAP of 0.108-0.504, MRR of\n0.134-0.510, and Accuracy@1 of 0.125-0.5 on five Defects4J projects.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive Learning (CL) is one of the most popular self-supervised learning\nframeworks for graph representation learning, which trains a Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) by discriminating positive and negative node pairs. However,\nthere are two challenges for CL on graphs. On the one hand, traditional CL\nmethods will unavoidably introduce semantic errors since they will treat some\nsemantically similar nodes as negative pairs. On the other hand, most of the\nexisting CL methods ignore the multiplexity nature of the real-world graphs,\nwhere nodes are connected by various relations and each relation represents a\nview of the graph. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Graph\nMulti-View Prototypical (Graph-MVP) framework to extract node embeddings on\nmultiplex graphs. Firstly, we introduce a Graph Prototypical Contrastive\nLearning (Graph-PCL) framework to capture both node-level and semantic-level\ninformation for each view of multiplex graphs. Graph-PCL captures the\nnode-level information by a simple yet effective data transformation technique.\nIt captures the semantic-level information by an Expectation-Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm, which alternatively performs clustering over node embeddings and\nparameter updating for GNN. Next, we introduce Graph-MVP based on Graph-PCL to\njointly model different views of the multiplex graphs. Our key insight behind\nGraph-MVP is that different view-specific embeddings of the same node should\nhave similar underlying semantic, based on which we propose two versions of\nGraph-MVP: Graph-MVP_hard and Graph-MVP_soft to align embeddings across views.\nFinally, we evaluate the proposed Graph-PCL and Graph-MVP on a variety of\nreal-world datasets and downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed Graph-PCL and Graph-MVP frameworks.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies data aggregation in large-scale regularly deployed\nInternet of Things (IoT) networks, where devices generate synchronized\ntime-triggered traffic (e.g., measurements or updates). The data granularity,\nin terms of information content and temporal resolution, is parameterized by\nthe sizes of the generated packets and the duty cycle of packet generation. The\ngenerated data packets at the devices are aggregated through static terrestrial\ngateways. Universal frequency reuse is adopted across all gateways and\nrandomized scheduling is utilized for the IoT devices associated with each\ngateway. Such network model finds applications in environmental sensing,\nprecision agriculture, and geological seismic sensing to name a few. To this\nend, we develop a novel spatiotemporal mathematical model to characterize the\ninterplay between data granularity, transmission reliability, and delay. The\ndeveloped model accounts for several IoT design parameters, which include\npacket sizes, generation duty cycle, devices and gateways spatial densities,\ntransmission rate adaptation, power control, and antenna directivity. For\ntractable analysis, we propose two accurate approximations, based on the\nPoisson point process, to characterize the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) based transmission reliability.\nFor the delay analysis, we propose a phase-type arrival/departure (PH/PH/1)\nqueueing model that accounts for packet generation, transmission scheduling,\nand rate-sensitive SINR-based packet departure. The developed model is utilized\nto obtain the optimal transmission rate for the IoT devices that minimizes\ndelay. The numerical results delineate the joint feasibility range of packet\nsizes and inter-arrival times for data aggregation and reveal significant gains\nwhen deploying directional antennas.",

In this paper, we attempt to accomplish several\nNLP tasks in the zero-shot scenario using a BERT original pre-training task\nabandoned by RoBERTa and other models--Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). Unlike\ntoken-level techniques, our sentence-level prompt-based method NSP-BERT does\nnot need to fix the length of the prompt or the position to be predicted,\nallowing it to handle tasks such as entity linking with ease. Based on the\ncharacteristics of NSP-BERT, we offer several quick building templates for\nvarious downstream tasks. We suggest a two-stage prompt method for word sense\ndisambiguation tasks in particular. Our strategies for mapping the labels\nsignificantly enhance the model's performance on sentence pair tasks.

    "abstract": "Vision-based depth estimation is a key feature in autonomous systems, which\noften relies on a single camera or several independent ones. In such a\nmonocular setup, dense depth is obtained with either additional input from one\nor several expensive LiDARs, e.g., with 64 beams, or camera-only methods, which\nsuffer from scale-ambiguity and infinite-depth problems. In this paper, we\npropose a new alternative of densely estimating metric depth by combining a\nmonocular camera with a light-weight LiDAR, e.g., with 4 beams, typical of\ntoday's automotive-grade mass-produced laser scanners. Inspired by recent\nself-supervised methods, we introduce a novel framework, called LiDARTouch, to\nestimate dense depth maps from monocular images with the help of ``touches'' of\nLiDAR, i.e., without the need for dense ground-truth depth. In our setup, the\nminimal LiDAR input contributes on three different levels: as an additional\nmodel's input, in a self-supervised LiDAR reconstruction objective function,\nand to estimate changes of pose (a key component of self-supervised depth\nestimation architectures). Our LiDARTouch framework achieves new state of the\nart in self-supervised depth estimation on the KITTI dataset, thus supporting\nour choices of integrating the very sparse LiDAR signal with other visual\nfeatures. Moreover, we show that the use of a few-beam LiDAR alleviates scale\nambiguity and infinite-depth issues that camera-only methods suffer from. We\nalso demonstrate that methods from the fully-supervised depth-completion\nliterature can be adapted to a self-supervised regime with a minimal LiDAR\nsignal.",

    "title": "Good-Enough Synthesis",
    "abstract": "In the classical synthesis problem, we are given an LTL formula \\psi over\nsets of input and output signals, and we synthesize a system T that realizes\n\\psi: with every input sequences x, the system associates an output sequence\nT(x) such that the generated computation x \\otimes T(x) satisfies \\psi. In\npractice, the requirement to satisfy the specification in all environments is\noften too strong, and it is common to add assumptions on the environment. We\nintroduce a new type of relaxation on this requirement. In good-enough\nsynthesis (GE-synthesis), the system is required to generate a satisfying\ncomputation only if one exists. Formally, an input sequence x is hopeful if\nthere exists some output sequence y such that the computation x \\otimes y\nsatisfies \\psi, and a system GE-realizes \\psi if it generates a computation\nthat satisfies \\psi on all hopeful input sequences. GE-synthesis is\nparticularly relevant when the notion of correctness is multi-valued (rather\nthan Boolean), and thus we seek systems of the highest possible quality, and\nwhen synthesizing autonomous systems, which interact with unexpected\nenvironments and are often only expected to do their best. We study\nGE-synthesis in Boolean and multi-valued settings. In both, we suggest and\nsolve various definitions of GE-synthesis, corresponding to different ways a\ndesigner may want to take hopefulness into account. We show that in all\nvariants, GE-synthesis is not computationally harder than traditional\nsynthesis, and can be implemented on top of existing tools. Our algorithms are\nbased on careful combinations of nondeterministic and universal automata. We\naugment systems that GE-realize their specifications by monitors that provide\nsatisfaction information. In the multi-valued setting, we provide both a\nworst-case analysis and an expectation-based one, the latter corresponding to\nan interaction with a stochastic environment.",

    "abstract": "The annotation of domain experts is important for some medical applications\nwhere the objective groundtruth is ambiguous to define, e.g., the\nrehabilitation for some chronic diseases, and the prescreening of some\nmusculoskeletal abnormalities without further medical examinations. However,\nimproper uses of the annotations may hinder developing reliable models. On one\nhand, forcing the use of a single groundtruth generated from multiple\nannotations is less informative for the modeling. On the other hand, feeding\nthe model with all the annotations without proper regularization is noisy given\nexisting disagreements. For such issues, we propose a novel agreement learning\nframework to tackle the challenge of learning from multiple annotators without\nobjective groundtruth. The framework has two streams, with one stream fitting\nwith the multiple annotators and the other stream learning agreement\ninformation between the annotators. In particular, the agreement learning\nstream produces regularization information to the classifier stream, tuning its\ndecision to be better in line with the agreement between the annotators. The\nproposed method can be easily plugged to existing backbones developed with\nmajority-voted groundtruth or multiple annotations. Thereon, experiments on two\nmedical datasets demonstrate improved agreement levels with annotators.",

    "abstract": "Videos have become a powerful tool for spreading illegal content such as\nmilitary propaganda, revenge porn, or bullying through social networks. To\ncounter these illegal activities, it has become essential to try new methods to\nverify the origin of videos from these platforms. However, collecting datasets\nlarge enough to train neural networks for this task has become difficult\nbecause of the privacy regulations that have been enacted in recent years. To\nmitigate this limitation, in this work we propose two different solutions based\non transfer learning and multitask learning to determine whether a video has\nbeen uploaded from or downloaded to a specific social platform through the use\nof shared features with images trained on the same task. By transferring\nfeatures from the shallowest to the deepest levels of the network from the\nimage task to videos, we measure the amount of information shared between these\ntwo tasks. Then, we introduce a model based on multitask learning, which learns\nfrom both tasks simultaneously. The promising experimental results show, in\nparticular, the effectiveness of the multitask approach. According to our\nknowledge, this is the first work that addresses the problem of social media\nplatform identification of videos through the use of shared features.",

    "abstract": "The application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to the domain of electrical\npower grids has high potential impact on smart grid monitoring. Even though\nthere is a natural correspondence of power flow to message-passing in GNNs,\ntheir performance on power grids is not well-understood. We argue that there is\na gap between GNN research driven by benchmarks which contain graphs that\ndiffer from power grids in several important aspects. Additionally, inductive\nlearning of GNNs across multiple power grid topologies has not been explored\nwith real-world data. We address this gap by means of (i) defining power grid\ngraph datasets in inductive settings, (ii) an exploratory analysis of graph\nproperties, and (iii) an empirical study of the concrete learning task of state\nestimation on real-world power grids. Our results show that GNNs are more\nrobust to noise with up to 400% lower error compared to baselines. Furthermore,\ndue to the unique properties of electrical grids, we do not observe the well\nknown over-smoothing phenomenon of GNNs and find the best performing models to\nbe exceptionally deep with up to 13 layers. This is in stark contrast to\nexisting benchmark datasets where the consensus is that 2 to 3 layer GNNs\nperform best.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method of learning Local-GlObal Contextual Adaptation\nfor fully end-to-end and fast bottom-up human Pose estimation, dubbed as\nLOGO-CAP. It is built on the conceptually simple center-offset formulation that\nlacks inaccuracy for pose estimation. When revisiting the bottom-up human pose\nestimation with the thought of \"thinking, fast and slow\" by D. Kahneman, we\nintroduce a \"slow keypointer\" to remedy the lack of sufficient accuracy of the\n\"fast keypointer\". In learning the \"slow keypointer\", the proposed LOGO-CAP\nlifts the initial \"fast\" keypoints by offset predictions to keypoint expansion\nmaps (KEMs) to counter their uncertainty in two modules. Firstly, the local\nKEMs (e.g., 11x11) are extracted from a low-dimensional feature map. A proposed\nconvolutional message passing module learns to \"re-focus\" the local KEMs to the\nkeypoint attraction maps (KAMs) by accounting for the structured output\nprediction nature of human pose estimation, which is directly supervised by the\nobject keypoint similarity (OKS) loss in training. Secondly, the global KEMs\nare extracted, with a sufficiently large region-of-interest (e.g., 97x97), from\nthe keypoint heatmaps that are computed by a direct map-to-map regression.\nThen, a local-global contextual adaptation module is proposed to convolve the\nglobal KEMs using the learned KAMs as the kernels. This convolution can be\nunderstood as the learnable offsets guided deformable and dynamic convolution\nin a pose-sensitive way. The proposed method is end-to-end trainable with near\nreal-time inference speed, obtaining state-of-the-art performance on the COCO\nkeypoint benchmark for bottom-up human pose estimation. With the COCO trained\nmodel, our LOGO-CAP also outperforms prior arts by a large margin on the\nchallenging OCHuman dataset.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing trend towards Industry 4.0 has revolutionised ordinary\nworkplaces, profoundly changing the role played by humans in the production\nchain. Research on ergonomics in industrial settings mainly focuses on reducing\nthe operator's physical fatigue and discomfort to improve throughput and avoid\nsafety hazards.

State-of-the-art\nassessment protocols, the majority of which are qualitative, often cause biased\nassessment. Very few therapeutic systems aim to assist the physiotherapists in\nthis regard. Aim: To design a sensor-based assistive technology for the\nphysiotherapists, facilitating a reliable quantitative assessment with\nreal-time visualization of Performance Metrics (PM). Method: 5 healthy subjects\n(Mean=24.4$\\pm$2.4 years, 80% Male), 16 patients with BM (Mean=39.56$\\pm$16.4\nyears, 76.92% Male), and 5 physiotherapists volunteered with informed consent.\nEach patient was evaluated by both the system and the physiotherapists in 3\nsessions. Results: Insignificant difference between the mean (t(15)=1.39,\np=.184) and the variance (F(1, 15)=1.05, p=.460) of system evaluation\n(Mean=6.19, 95% CI, [4.52, 7.86]) and that of the physiotherapists (Mean=6.38,\n95% CI, [4.75, 8.01]) having a strong, positive correlation, r=.9885 was\nobserved. The system showed good reliability from the Cronbach's Alpha test,\nwith $\\alpha$=.8499. Conclusions and Significance: To ensure effective\nrehabilitation, proper assessment is obligatory. Sensor-based measurement of PM\nensures reliability, reducing the chances of human error. Real-time\nvisualization informs about patient's progress. Automated quantitative\nassessment reduces the possibility of bias, allowing optimization of\nrehabilitation scheme.",

Many DA approaches aim at expanding the\nsupport of the empirical data distribution by generating new sentence pairs\nthat contain infrequent words, thus making it closer to the true data\ndistribution of parallel sentences. In this paper, we propose to follow a\ncompletely different approach and present a multi-task DA approach in which we\ngenerate new sentence pairs with transformations, such as reversing the order\nof the target sentence, which produce unfluent target sentences. During\ntraining, these augmented sentences are used as auxiliary tasks in a multi-task\nframework with the aim of providing new contexts where the target prefix is not\ninformative enough to predict the next word. This strengthens the encoder and\nforces the decoder to pay more attention to the source representations of the\nencoder. Experiments carried out on six low-resource translation tasks show\nconsistent improvements over the baseline and over DA methods aiming at\nextending the support of the empirical data distribution.

    "abstract": "Unfair stereotypical biases (e.g., gender, racial, or religious biases)\nencoded in modern pretrained language models (PLMs) have negative ethical\nimplications for widespread adoption of state-of-the-art language technology.\nTo remedy for this, a wide range of debiasing techniques have recently been\nintroduced to remove such stereotypical biases from PLMs. Existing debiasing\nmethods, however, directly modify all of the PLMs parameters, which -- besides\nbeing computationally expensive -- comes with the inherent risk of\n(catastrophic) forgetting of useful language knowledge acquired in pretraining.\nIn this work, we propose a more sustainable modular debiasing approach based on\ndedicated debiasing adapters, dubbed ADELE. Concretely, we (1) inject adapter\nmodules into the original PLM layers and (2) update only the adapters (i.e., we\nkeep the original PLM parameters frozen) via language modeling training on a\ncounterfactually augmented corpus. We showcase ADELE, in gender debiasing of\nBERT: our extensive evaluation, encompassing three intrinsic and two extrinsic\nbias measures, renders ADELE, very effective in bias mitigation. We further\nshow that -- due to its modular nature -- ADELE, coupled with task adapters,\nretains fairness even after large-scale downstream training.

    "title": "A Needle in a Haystack -- How to Derive Relevant Scenarios for Testing  Automated Driving Systems in Urban Areas",
    "abstract": "While there was great progress regarding the technology and its\nimplementation for vehicles equipped with automated driving systems (ADS), the\nproblem of how to proof their safety as a necessary precondition prior to\nmarket launch remains unsolved. One promising solution are scenario-based test\napproaches; however, there is no commonly accepted way of how to systematically\ngenerate and extract the set of relevant scenarios to be tested to sufficiently\ncapture the real-world traffic dynamics, especially for urban operational\ndesign domains. Within the scope of this paper, the overall concept of a novel\nsimulation-based toolchain for the development and testing of ADS-equipped\nvehicles in urban environments is presented. Based on previous work regarding\nhighway environments, the developed novel enhancements aim at empowering the\ntoolchain to be able to deal with the increased complexity due to the more\ncomplex road networks with multi-modal interactions of various traffic\nparticipants. Based on derived requirements, a thorough explanation of\ndifferent modules constituting the toolchain is given, showing first results\nand identified research gaps, respectively. A closer look is taken on two use\ncases: First, it is investigated whether the toolchain is capable to serve as\nsynthetic data source within the development phase of ADS-equipped vehicles to\nenrich a scenario database in terms of extent, complexity and impacts of\ndifferent what-if-scenarios for future mixed traffic. Second, it is analyzed\nhow to combine the individual advantages of real recorded data and an\nagent-based simulation within a so-called adaptive replay-to-sim approach to\nsupport the testing phase of an ADS-equipped vehicle. The developed toolchain\ncontributes to the overarching goal of a commonly accepted methodology for the\nvalidation and safety proof of ADS-equipped vehicles, especially in urban\nenvironments.",

More precisely, parameters are rational symbolic constants\nused for time constraints on the firing of transitions and we want to\nsynthesise all their values such that some marking is reachable, with a cost\nthat is either minimal or simply less than a given bound.\nWe first prove that the mere existence of values for the parameters such that\nthe latter property holds is undecidable.

    "abstract": "Second generation consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Stake, promise to\nprovide more favourable energy consumption characteristics than those of their\npredecessors, such as Proof-of-Work. In this paper, we quantify and compare the\nenergy demand of four archetypal modalities of second-generation systems:\nAlgorand, Ethereum 2.0, Hedera Hashgraph, and Polkadot. While numerous studies\nthat analyse the energy demands of individual distributed ledger systems have\nbeen undertaken previously, little work has been done to compare different\nsystems that operate based on distinct technological assumptions. We approach\nthis research question by formalising a basic mathematical consumption model\nfor validatorbased Sybil attack resistance schemes. This model allows\nquantifying the energy consumption per transaction based on common input\nvariables, such as the number of validators and the throughput characteristics\nof the system analysed. We find that, when applying contemporary throughput and\nvalidator counts, Hedera Hashgraph, by operating as a permissioned system, has\nthe most favourable energy consumption characteristics with 20.95 mW h/tx. This\nstands in contrast to the permissionless systems Algorand with 4.427 W h/tx,\nand Polkadot with 115.6 W h/tx. A very broad projection for Ethereum 2.0\nsuggests an energy consumption of 2.862 W h/tx to 557.5 W h/tx. The present\nfindings support the intuition that the complexity of Sybil attack resistance\nmechanisms, and therefore the energy needs of the overarching consensus\nprotocols, is largely dependent on the number of active validators.\nConsequently, a permissioned setting in which a can control the number of\nvalidators can be beneficial to minimise energy consumption.",

    "abstract": "Clothing changes and lack of data labels are both crucial challenges in\nperson ReID. For the former challenge, people may occur multiple times at\ndifferent locations wearing different clothing. However, most of the current\nperson ReID research works focus on the benchmarks in which a person's clothing\nis kept the same all the time. For the last challenge, some researchers try to\nmake model learn information from a labeled dataset as a source to an unlabeled\ndataset. Whereas purely unsupervised training is less used. In this paper, we\naim to solve both problems at the same time. We design a novel unsupervised\nmodel, Sync-Person-Cloud ReID, to solve the unsupervised clothing change person\nReID problem. We developer a purely unsupervised clothing change person ReID\npipeline with person sync augmentation operation and same person feature\nrestriction. The person sync augmentation is to supply additional same person\nresources. These same person's resources can be used as part supervised input\nby same person feature restriction. The extensive experiments on clothing\nchange ReID datasets show the out-performance of our methods.",

At the same time, the\ncomplexity of modern machine learning makes it challenging to comprehend a\nmodel's reasoning process, let alone express specific prior assumptions in a\nrigorous manner. While primarily interested in the former issue, recent\ndevelopments intransparent machine learning could also broaden the range of\nprior information that we can provide to complex Bayesian models. Inspired by\nthe idea of self-explaining models, we introduce a corresponding concept for\nvariational GaussianProcesses.

    "abstract": "Machine learning methods have greatly changed science, engineering, finance,\nbusiness, and other fields. Despite the tremendous accomplishments of machine\nlearning and deep learning methods, many challenges still remain. In\nparticular, the performance of machine learning methods is often severely\naffected in case of diverse data, usually associated with smaller data sets or\ndata related to areas of study where the size of the data sets is constrained\nby the complexity and/or high cost of experiments. Moreover, data with limited\nlabeled samples is a challenge to most learning approaches. In this paper, the\naforementioned challenges are addressed by integrating graph-based frameworks,\nmultiscale structure, modified and adapted optimization procedures and\nsemi-supervised techniques. This results in two innovative multiscale Laplacian\nlearning (MLL) approaches for machine learning tasks, such as data\nclassification, and for tackling diverse data, data with limited samples and\nsmaller data sets. The first approach, called multikernel manifold learning\n(MML), integrates manifold learning with multikernel information and solves a\nregularization problem consisting of a loss function and a warped kernel\nregularizer using multiscale graph Laplacians. The second approach, called the\nmultiscale MBO (MMBO) method, introduces multiscale Laplacians to a\nmodification of the famous classical Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme, and\nmakes use of fast solvers for finding the approximations to the extremal\neigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. We demonstrate the performance of our\nmethods experimentally on a variety of data sets, such as biological, text and\nimage data, and compare them favorably to existing approaches.",

Machine learning models can derive multi-variate brain\nchange patterns related to the two processes, including the SPARE-AD (Spatial\nPatterns of Atrophy for Recognition of Alzheimer's Disease) and SPARE-BA (of\nBrain Aging) investigated herein. However, substantial overlap between brain\nregions affected in the two processes confounds measuring them independently.\nWe present a methodology toward disentangling the two. T1-weighted MRI images\nof 4,054 participants (48-95 years) with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI),\nor cognitively normal (CN) diagnoses from the iSTAGING (Imaging-based\ncoordinate SysTem for AGIng and NeurodeGenerative diseases) consortium were\nanalyzed. First, a subset of AD patients and CN adults were selected based\npurely on clinical diagnoses to train SPARE-BA1 (regression of age using CN\nindividuals) and SPARE-AD1 (classification of CN versus AD). Second, analogous\ngroups were selected based on clinical and molecular markers to train SPARE-BA2\nand SPARE-AD2: amyloid-positive (A+) AD continuum group (consisting of A+AD,\nA+MCI, and A+ and tau-positive CN individuals) and amyloid-negative (A-) CN\ngroup. Finally, the combined group of the AD continuum and A-/CN individuals\nwas used to train SPARE-BA3, with the intention to estimate brain age\nregardless of AD-related brain changes. Disentangled SPARE models derived brain\npatterns that were more specific to the two types of the brain changes.\nCorrelation between the SPARE-BA and SPARE-AD was significantly reduced.\nCorrelation of disentangled SPARE-AD was non-inferior to the molecular\nmeasurements and to the number of APOE4 alleles, but was less to AD-related\npsychometric test scores, suggesting contribution of advanced brain aging to\nthese scores.",

In addition, it allows us to\nuse existing question answering models pre-trained on existing large datasets.\nFinally, it explicitly identifies the information missing from a scenario in\ncase policy compliance cannot be determined.

Such a polyhedron is\nfirst decomposed into a set of triangular and/or rectangular pyramids, whose\ncertain faces correspond to the given parametric surfaces. Each pyramid serves\nas an integration cell with a geometric mapping from a standard parent domain\n(e.g., a unit cube), where the tensor-product Gauss quadrature is adopted. As\nno constraint is imposed on the decomposition, certain resulting pyramids may\nintersect with themselves, and thus their geometric mappings may present\nnegative Jacobian values. We call such cells the folded cells and refer to the\ncorresponding decomposition as a folded decomposition. We show that folded\ncells do not cause any issues in practice as they are only used to numerically\ncompute certain integrals of interest. The same idea can be applied to planar\ncurved polygons as well. We demonstrate both theoretically and numerically that\nfolded cells can retain the same accuracy as the cells with strictly positive\nJacobians. On the other hand, folded cells allow for a much easier and much\nmore flexible decomposition for general curved polyhedra, on which one can\nrobustly compute integrals.

There are two\nmain challenges usually associated with this problem. Firstly, learning through\nonline exploration is not possible due to the critical nature of such\napplications. Therefore, we need to resort to observational datasets with no\ncounterfactuals. Secondly, such datasets are usually imperfect, additionally\ncursed with missing values in the attributes of features. In this paper, we\nconsider the problem of constructing personalized policies using logged data\nwhen there are missing values in the attributes of features in both training\nand test data. The goal is to recommend an action (treatment) when $\\Xt$, a\ndegraded version of $\\Xb$ with missing values, is observed. We consider three\nstrategies for dealing with missingness. In particular, we introduce the\n\\textit{conservative strategy} where the policy is designed to safely handle\nthe uncertainty due to missingness. In order to implement this strategy we need\nto estimate posterior distribution $p(\\Xb|\\Xt)$, we use variational autoencoder\nto achieve this.

Therefore, it is important to develop algorithms that help the\ntraining of deep networks and their generalization to noise-free test sets. In\nthis paper, we propose a robust training strategy against label noise, called\nRAFNI, that can be used with any CNN. This algorithm filters and relabels\ninstances of the training set based on the predictions and their probabilities\nmade by the backbone neural network during the training process. That way, this\nalgorithm improves the generalization ability of the CNN on its own. RAFNI\nconsists of three mechanisms: two mechanisms that filter instances and one\nmechanism that relabels instances.

    "abstract": "Explanations shed light on a machine learning model's rationales and can aid\nin identifying deficiencies in its reasoning process. Explanation generation\nmodels are typically trained in a supervised way given human explanations. When\nsuch annotations are not available, explanations are often selected as those\nportions of the input that maximise a downstream task's performance, which\ncorresponds to optimising an explanation's Faithfulness to a given model.\nFaithfulness is one of several so-called diagnostic properties, which prior\nwork has identified as useful for gauging the quality of an explanation without\nrequiring annotations. Other diagnostic properties are Data Consistency, which\nmeasures how similar explanations are for similar input instances, and\nConfidence Indication, which shows whether the explanation reflects the\nconfidence of the model. In this work, we show how to directly optimise for\nthese diagnostic properties when training a model to generate sentence-level\nexplanations, which markedly improves explanation quality, agreement with human\nrationales, and downstream task performance on three complex reasoning tasks.",

Most of\nthe current algorithms require comparable individual efforts to train on-device\nmodels with the same structure and size, impeding participation from\nresource-constrained devices. Given the widespread yet heterogeneous devices\nnowadays, this paper proposes a new framework supporting federated learning\nacross heterogeneous on-device models via Zero-shot Knowledge Transfer, named\nby FedZKT. Specifically, FedZKT allows participating devices to independently\ndetermine their on-device models. To transfer knowledge across on-device\nmodels, FedZKT develops a zero-shot distillation approach contrary to certain\nprior research based on a public dataset or a pre-trained data generator. To\nutmostly reduce on-device workload, the resource-intensive distillation task is\nassigned to the server, which constructs a generator to adversarially train\nwith the ensemble of the received heterogeneous on-device models. The distilled\ncentral knowledge will then be sent back in the form of the corresponding\non-device model parameters, which can be easily absorbed at the device side.\nExperimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of FedZKT\ntowards heterogeneous on-device models and challenging federated learning\nscenarios, such as non-iid data distribution and straggler effects.",

This is a well-known approximation tool that is widely used in\nmany applicative yields, due to the optimal behavior of the related Lebesgue\nconstants.

    "abstract": "A streaming algorithm is adversarially robust if it is guaranteed to perform\ncorrectly even in the presence of an adaptive adversary. Recently, several\nsophisticated frameworks for robustification of classical streaming algorithms\nhave been developed. One of the main open questions in this area is whether\nefficient adversarially robust algorithms exist for moment estimation problems\nunder the turnstile streaming model, where both insertions and deletions are\nallowed. So far, the best known space complexity for streams of length $m$,\nachieved using differential privacy (DP) based techniques, is of order\n$\\tilde{O}(m^{1/2})$ for computing a constant-factor approximation with high\nconstant probability.\nIn this work, we propose a new simple approach to tracking moments by\nalternating between two different regimes: a sparse regime, in which we can\nexplicitly maintain the current frequency vector and use standard sparse\nrecovery techniques, and a dense regime, in which we make use of existing\nDP-based robustification frameworks. The results obtained using our technique\nbreak the previous $m^{1/2}$ barrier for any fixed $p$. More specifically, our\nspace complexity for $F_2$-estimation is $\\tilde{O}(m^{2/5})$ and for\n$F_0$-estimation, i.e., counting the number of distinct elements, it is $\\tilde\nO(m^{1/3})$.\nAll existing robustness frameworks have their space complexity depend\nmultiplicatively on a parameter $\\lambda$ called the \\emph{flip number} of the\nstreaming problem, where $\\lambda = m$ in turnstile moment estimation. The best\nknown dependence in these frameworks (for constant factor approximation) is of\norder $\\tilde{O}(\\lambda^{1/2})$, and it is known to be tight for certain\nproblems. Again, our approach breaks this barrier, achieving a dependence of\norder $\\tilde{O}(\\lambda^{1/2 - c(p)})$ for $F_p$-estimation, where $c(p) > 0$\ndepends only on $p$.",

    "abstract": "Projecting the point cloud on the 2D spherical range image transforms the\nLiDAR semantic segmentation to a 2D segmentation task on the range image.\nHowever, the LiDAR range image is still naturally different from the regular 2D\nRGB image; for example, each position on the range image encodes the unique\ngeometry information. In this paper, we propose a new projection-based LiDAR\nsemantic segmentation pipeline that consists of a novel network structure and\nan efficient post-processing step. In our network structure, we design a FID\n(fully interpolation decoding) module that directly upsamples the\nmulti-resolution feature maps using bilinear interpolation. Inspired by the 3D\ndistance interpolation used in PointNet++, we argue this FID module is a 2D\nversion distance interpolation on $(\\theta, \\phi)$ space. As a parameter-free\ndecoding module, the FID largely reduces the model complexity by maintaining\ngood performance. Besides the network structure, we empirically find that our\nmodel predictions have clear boundaries between different semantic classes.\nThis makes us rethink whether the widely used K-nearest-neighbor\npost-processing is still necessary for our pipeline. Then, we realize the\nmany-to-one mapping causes the blurring effect that some points are mapped into\nthe same pixel and share the same label. Therefore, we propose to process those\noccluded points by assigning the nearest predicted label to them. This NLA\n(nearest label assignment) post-processing step shows a better performance than\nKNN with faster inference speed in the ablation study. On the SemanticKITTI\ndataset, our pipeline achieves the best performance among all projection-based\nmethods with $64 \\times 2048$ resolution and all point-wise solutions. With a\nResNet-34 as the backbone, both the training and testing of our model can be\nfinished on a single RTX 2080 Ti with 11G memory. The code is released.",

However, new\napps often have few (or even no) user feedback, suffering from the classic\ncold-start problem. How to quickly identify and then recommend new apps of high\nquality is a challenging issue. Here, a fundamental requirement is the\ncapability to accurately measure an app's quality based on its inborn features,\nrather than user-generated features. Since users obtain first-hand experience\nof an app by interacting with its views, we speculate that the inborn features\nare largely related to the visual quality of individual views in an app and the\nways the views switch to one another. In this work, we propose AppQ, a novel\napp quality grading and recommendation system that extracts inborn features of\napps based on app source code. In particular, AppQ works in parallel to perform\ncode analysis to extract app-level features as well as dynamic analysis to\ncapture view-level layout hierarchy and the switching among views. Each app is\nthen expressed as an attributed view graph, which is converted into a vector\nand fed to classifiers for recognizing its quality classes.

    "abstract": "Recent work on multilingual AMR-to-text generation has exclusively focused on\ndata augmentation strategies that utilize silver AMR. However, this assumes a\nhigh quality of generated AMRs, potentially limiting the transferability to the\ntarget task. In this paper, we investigate different techniques for\nautomatically generating AMR annotations, where we aim to study which source of\ninformation yields better multilingual results. Our models trained on gold AMR\nwith silver (machine translated) sentences outperform approaches which leverage\ngenerated silver AMR. We find that combining both complementary sources of\ninformation further improves multilingual AMR-to-text generation.

    "title": "Scaled ReLU Matters for Training Vision Transformers",
    "abstract": "Vision transformers (ViTs) have been an alternative design paradigm to\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the training of ViTs is much\nharder than CNNs, as it is sensitive to the training parameters, such as\nlearning rate, optimizer and warmup epoch. The reasons for training difficulty\nare empirically analysed in ~\\cite{xiao2021early}, and the authors conjecture\nthat the issue lies with the \\textit{patchify-stem} of ViT models and propose\nthat early convolutions help transformers see better. In this paper, we further\ninvestigate this problem and extend the above conclusion: only early\nconvolutions do not help for stable training, but the scaled ReLU operation in\nthe \\textit{convolutional stem} (\\textit{conv-stem}) matters. We verify, both\ntheoretically and empirically, that scaled ReLU in \\textit{conv-stem} not only\nimproves training stabilization, but also increases the diversity of patch\ntokens, thus boosting peak performance with a large margin via adding few\nparameters and flops. In addition, extensive experiments are conducted to\ndemonstrate that previous ViTs are far from being well trained, further showing\nthat ViTs have great potential to be a better substitute of CNNs.",

    "abstract": "Humans excel at learning long-horizon tasks from demonstrations augmented\nwith textual commentary, as evidenced by the burgeoning popularity of tutorial\nvideos online. Intuitively, this capability can be separated into 2 distinct\nsubtasks - first, dividing a long-horizon demonstration sequence into\nsemantically meaningful events; second, adapting such events into meaningful\nbehaviors in one's own environment. Here, we present Video2Skill (V2S), which\nattempts to extend this capability to artificial agents by allowing a robot arm\nto learn from human cooking videos. We first use sequence-to-sequence\nAuto-Encoder style architectures to learn a temporal latent space for events in\nlong-horizon demonstrations. We then transfer these representations to the\nrobotic target domain, using a small amount of offline and unrelated\ninteraction data (sequences of state-action pairs of the robot arm controlled\nby an expert) to adapt these events into actionable representations, i.e.,\nskills. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach results in\nself-supervised analogy learning, where the agent learns to draw analogies\nbetween motions in human demonstration data and behaviors in the robotic\nenvironment. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on model learning\n- demonstrating how Video2Skill utilizes prior knowledge from human\ndemonstration to outperform traditional model learning of long-horizon\ndynamics. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach for non-tabula\nrasa decision-making, i.e, utilizing video demonstration for zero-shot skill\ngeneration.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Although recent deep energy-based generative models (EBMs) have\nshown encouraging results in many image generation tasks, how to take advantage\nof the self-adversarial cogitation in deep EBMs to boost the performance of\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction is still desired.\nMethods: With the successful application of deep learning in a wide range of\nMRI reconstruction, a line of emerging research involves formulating an\noptimization-based reconstruction method in the space of a generative model.\nLeveraging this, a novel regularization strategy is introduced in this article\nwhich takes advantage of self-adversarial cogitation of the deep energy-based\nmodel. More precisely, we advocate for alternative learning a more powerful\nenergy-based model with maximum likelihood estimation to obtain the deep\nenergy-based information, represented as image prior. Simultaneously, implicit\ninference with Langevin dynamics is a unique property of re-construction. In\ncontrast to other generative models for reconstruction, the proposed method\nutilizes deep energy-based information as the image prior in reconstruction to\nimprove the quality of image.\nResults: Experiment results that imply the proposed technique can obtain\nremarkable performance in terms of high reconstruction accuracy that is\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art methods, and does not suffer from mode\ncollapse.\nConclusion: Algorithmically, an iterative approach was presented to\nstrengthen EBM training with the gradient of energy network. The robustness and\nthe reproducibility of the algorithm were also experimentally validated. More\nimportantly, the proposed reconstruction framework can be generalized for most\nMRI reconstruction scenarios.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the concept of smart radio environments, currently extensively\nstudied for wireless communication in metasurface-programmable meter-scaled\nenvironments (e.g., inside rooms), on the chip scale. Wired intra-chip\ncommunication for information exchange between cores increasingly becomes a\ncomputation-speed-bottleneck for modern multi-core chips. Wireless intra-chip\nlinks with millimeter waves are a candidate technology to address this\nchallenge, but they currently face their own problems: the on-chip propagation\nenvironment can be highly reverberant due to the metallic chip enclosure but\ntransceiver modules must be kept simple (on/off keying) such that long channel\nimpulse responses (CIRs) slow down the communication rate. Here, we overcome\nthis problem by endowing the on-chip propagation environment with in situ\nprogrammability, allowing us to shape the CIR at will, and to impose, for\ninstance, a pulse-like CIR despite the strong multi-path environment. Using\nfull-wave simulations, we design a programmable metasurface suitable for\nintegration in the on-chip environment (\"on-chip reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface\"), and we demonstrate that the spatial control offered by the\nmetasurface allows us to shape the CIR profile. We envision (i) dynamic\nmulti-channel CIR shaping adapted to on-chip traffic patterns, (ii) analog\nwave-based over-the-air computing inside the chip enclosure, and (iii) the\napplication of the explored concepts to off-chip communication inside racks,\ninside the chassis of personal computers, etc.",

Efficient interior-point methods have been\nproposed which leverage the block diagonal structure of the quadratic program\n(QP) resulting from the receding horizon control formulation.

Recently though an interior\npoint method based on the null-space method has been proposed which requires\nonly a single decomposition per iteration. While the then used null-space basis\nleads to dense null-space projections, in this work we propose a sparse\nnull-space basis which preserves the block diagonal structure of the MPC\nmatrices. Since it is based on the inverse of the transfer matrix we introduce\nthe notion of so-called virtual controls which enables just that invertibility.\nA combination of the reduced number of factorizations and omission of the\nevaluation of the dual lets our solver outperform others in terms of\ncomputational speed by an increasing margin dependent on the number of state\nand control variables.",

    "abstract": "Empirically multidimensional discriminator (critic) output can be\nadvantageous, while a solid explanation for it has not been discussed. In this\npaper, (i) we rigorously prove that high-dimensional critic output has\nadvantage on distinguishing real and fake distributions; (ii) we also introduce\nan square-root velocity transformation (SRVT) block which further magnifies\nthis advantage. The proof is based on our proposed maximal p-centrality\ndiscrepancy which is bounded above by p-Wasserstein distance and perfectly fits\nthe Wasserstein GAN framework with high-dimensional critic output n. We have\nalso showed when n = 1, the proposed discrepancy is equivalent to 1-Wasserstein\ndistance. The SRVT block is applied to break the symmetric structure of\nhigh-dimensional critic output and improve the generalization capability of the\ndiscriminator network. In terms of implementation, the proposed framework does\nnot require additional hyper-parameter tuning, which largely facilitates its\nusage. Experiments on image generation tasks show performance improvement on\nbenchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "High-quality, large-scale datasets have played a crucial role in the\ndevelopment and success of classical machine learning. Quantum Machine Learning\n(QML) is a new field that aims to use quantum computers for data analysis, with\nthe hope of obtaining a quantum advantage of some sort. While most proposed QML\narchitectures are benchmarked using classical datasets, there is still doubt\nwhether QML on classical datasets will achieve such an advantage. In this work,\nwe argue that one should instead employ quantum datasets composed of quantum\nstates. For this purpose, we introduce the NTangled dataset composed of quantum\nstates with different amounts and types of multipartite entanglement. We first\nshow how a quantum neural network can be trained to generate the states in the\nNTangled dataset. Then, we use the NTangled dataset to benchmark QML models for\nsupervised learning classification tasks. We also consider an alternative\nentanglement-based dataset, which is scalable and is composed of states\nprepared by quantum circuits with different depths. As a byproduct of our\nresults, we introduce a novel method for generating multipartite entangled\nstates, providing a use-case of quantum neural networks for quantum\nentanglement theory.",

    "title": "Can Noise on Qubits Be Learned in Quantum Neural Network? A Case Study  on QuantumFlow",
    "abstract": "In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, one of the key questions\nis how to deal with the high noise level existing in physical quantum bits\n(qubits). Quantum error correction is promising but requires an extensive\nnumber (e.g., over 1,000) of physical qubits to create one \"perfect\" qubit,\nexceeding the capacity of the existing quantum computers. This paper aims to\ntackle the noise issue from another angle: instead of creating perfect qubits\nfor general quantum algorithms, we investigate the potential to mitigate the\nnoise issue for dedicate algorithms. Specifically, this paper targets quantum\nneural network (QNN), and proposes to learn the errors in the training phase,\nso that the identified QNN model can be resilient to noise. As a result, the\nimplementation of QNN needs no or a small number of additional physical qubits,\nwhich is more realistic for the near-term quantum computers. To achieve this\ngoal, an application-specific compiler is essential: on the one hand, the error\ncannot be learned if the mapping from logical qubits to physical qubits exists\nrandomness; on the other hand, the compiler needs to be efficient so that the\nlengthy training procedure can be completed in a reasonable time. In this\npaper, we utilize the recent QNN framework, QuantumFlow, as a case study.\nExperimental results show that the proposed approach can optimize QNN models\nfor different errors in qubits, achieving up to 28% accuracy improvement\ncompared with the model obtained by the error-agnostic training.",

    "abstract": "Flexible load at the demand-side has been regarded as an effective measure to\ncope with volatile distributed renewable generations. To unlock the demand-side\nflexibility, this paper proposes a peer-to-peer energy sharing mechanism that\nfacilitates energy exchange among users while preserving privacy. We prove the\nexistence and partial uniqueness of the energy sharing market equilibrium and\nprovide a centralized optimization to obtain the equilibrium. The centralized\noptimization is further linearized by a convex combination approach, turning\ninto a multi-parametric linear program (MP-LP) with renewable output deviations\nbeing the parameters. The flexibility requirement of individual users is\ncalculated based on this MP-LP. To be specific, an adaptive vertex generation\nalgorithm is established to construct a piecewise linear estimator of the\noptimal total cost subject to a given error tolerance. Critical regions and\noptimal strategies are retrieved from the obtained approximate cost function to\nevaluate the flexibility requirement. The proposed algorithm does not rely on\nthe exact characterization of optimal basis invariant sets and thus is not\ninfluenced by model degeneracy, a common difficulty faced by existing\napproaches.

Challenges\nin medical image segmentation are mainly due to spatial variations of regions\nto be segmented and imbalance in distribution of classes. Commonly used metrics\ntreat all detected pixels, indiscriminately. However, pixels in smaller\nsegments must be treated differently from pixels in larger segments, as\ndetection of smaller ones aid in early treatment of associated disease and are\nalso easier to miss. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation metric for\nsegmentation performance, emphasizing smaller segments, by assigning higher\nweightage to smaller segment pixels. Weighted false positives are also\nconsidered in deriving the new metric named, \"SSEGEP\"(Small SEGment Emphasized\nPerformance evaluation metric), (range : 0(Bad) to 1(Good)). The experiments\nwere performed on diverse anatomies(eye, liver, pancreas and breast) from\npublicly available datasets to show applicability of the proposed metric across\ndifferent imaging techniques. Mean opinion score (MOS) and statistical\nsignificance testing is used to quantify the relevance of proposed approach.\nAcross 33 fundus images, where the largest exudate is 1.41%, and the smallest\nis 0.0002% of the image, the proposed metric is 30% closer to MOS, as compared\nto Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).

    "abstract": "Most image super-resolution (SR) methods are developed on synthetic\nlow-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs that are constructed\nby a predetermined operation, e.g., bicubic downsampling. As existing methods\ntypically learn an inverse mapping of the specific function, they produce\nblurry results when applied to real-world images whose exact formulation is\ndifferent and unknown. Therefore, several methods attempt to synthesize much\nmore diverse LR samples or learn a realistic downsampling model. However, due\nto restrictive assumptions on the downsampling process, they are still biased\nand less generalizable. This study proposes a novel method to simulate an\nunknown downsampling process without imposing restrictive prior knowledge. We\npropose a generalizable low-frequency loss (LFL) in the adversarial training\nframework to imitate the distribution of target LR images without using any\npaired examples. Furthermore, we design an adaptive data loss (ADL) for the\ndownsampler, which can be adaptively learned and updated from the data during\nthe training loops. Extensive experiments validate that our downsampling model\ncan facilitate existing SR methods to perform more accurate reconstructions on\nvarious synthetic and real-world examples than the conventional approaches.",

As is well known, the computational\ncomplexity of GPs scales cubically in the number of datapoints. We here show\nthat in the context of inverse problems involving integral operators, one faces\nadditional difficulties that hinder inversion on large grids. Furthermore, in\nthat context, covariance matrices can become too large to be stored. By\nleveraging results about sequential disintegrations of Gaussian measures, we\nare able to introduce an implicit representation of posterior covariance\nmatrices that reduces the memory footprint by only storing low rank\nintermediate matrices, while allowing individual elements to be accessed\non-the-fly without needing to build full posterior covariance matrices.\nMoreover, it allows for fast sequential inclusion of new observations.

We\ndemonstrate our approach by computing sequential data collection plans for\nexcursion set recovery for a gravimetric inverse problem, where the goal is to\nprovide fine resolution estimates of high density regions inside the Stromboli\nvolcano, Italy. Sequential data collection plans are computed by extending the\nweighted integrated variance reduction (wIVR) criterion to inverse problems.\nOur results show that this criterion is able to significantly reduce the\nuncertainty on the excursion volume, reaching close to minimal levels of\nresidual uncertainty.

Among the different\nways of consuming tobacco (e.g., smokeless, cigars), smoking cigarettes is the\nmost widespread.

In the first step, our algorithm\nperforms the detection of individual smoking gestures (i.e., puffs) using an\nartificial neural network with both convolutional and recurrent layers. In the\nsecond step, we make use of the detected puff density to achieve the temporal\nlocalization of smoking sessions that occur throughout the day.

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic imaging is being used to obtain information about the acoustic\nproperties of a medium by emitting waves into it and recording their\ninteraction using ultrasonic transducer arrays. The Delay-And-Sum (DAS)\nalgorithm forms images using the main path on which reflected signals travel\nback to the transducers. In some applications, different insonification paths\ncan be considered, for instance by placing the transducers at different\nlocations or if strong reflectors inside the medium are known a-priori. These\ndifferent modes give rise to multiple DAS images reflecting different geometric\ninformation about the scatterers and the challenge is to either fuse them into\none image or to directly extract higher-level information regarding the\nmaterials of the medium, e.g., a segmentation map. Traditional image fusion\ntechniques typically use ad-hoc combinations of pre-defined image transforms,\npooling operations and thresholding. In this work, we propose a deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) architecture that directly maps all available data to a\nsegmentation map while explicitly incorporating the DAS image formation for the\ndifferent insonification paths as network layers. This enables information flow\nbetween data pre-processing and image post-processing DNNs, trained end-to-end.\nWe compare our proposed method to a traditional image fusion technique using\nsimulated data experiments, mimicking a non-destructive testing application\nwith four image modes, i.e., two transducer locations and two internal\nreflection boundaries. Using our approach, it is possible to obtain much more\naccurate segmentation of defects.",

    "abstract": "In plane-wave imaging, multiple unfocused ultrasound waves are transmitted\ninto a medium of interest from different angles and an image is formed from the\nrecorded reflections. The number of plane waves used leads to a trade-off\nbetween frame-rate and image quality, with single-plane-wave (SPW) imaging\nbeing the fastest possible modality with the worst image quality. Recently,\ndeep learning methods have been proposed to improve ultrasound imaging. One\napproach is to use image-to-image networks that work on the formed image and\nanother is to directly learn a mapping from data to an image. Both approaches\nutilize purely data-driven models and require deep, expressive network\narchitectures, combined with large numbers of training samples to obtain good\nresults. Here, we propose a data-to-image architecture that incorporates a\nwave-physics-based image formation algorithm in-between deep convolutional\nneural networks. To achieve this, we implement the Fourier (FK) migration\nmethod as network layers and train the whole network end-to-end. We compare our\nproposed data-to-image network with an image-to-image network in simulated data\nexperiments, mimicking a medical ultrasound application. Experiments show that\nit is possible to obtain high-quality SPW images, almost similar to an image\nformed using 75 plane waves over an angular range of $\\pm$16$^\\circ$.

Machine learning methods provide faster alternatives to\ntraditional simulators by training neural network models with numerical\nsimulation data mappings.

    "abstract": "Choroid plexuses (CP) are structures of the ventricles of the brain which\nproduce most of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Several postmortem and in vivo\nstudies have pointed towards their role in the inflammatory process in multiple\nsclerosis (MS). Automatic segmentation of CP from MRI thus has high value for\nstudying their characteristics in large cohorts of patients. To the best of our\nknowledge, the only freely available tool for CP segmentation is FreeSurfer but\nits accuracy for this specific structure is poor. In this paper, we propose to\nautomatically segment CP from non-contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI. To that\nend, we introduce a new model called \"Axial-MLP\" based on an assembly of Axial\nmulti-layer perceptrons (MLPs). This is inspired by recent works which showed\nthat the self-attention layers of Transformers can be replaced with MLPs. This\napproach is systematically compared with a standard 3D U-Net, nnU-Net,\nFreesurfer and FastSurfer. For our experiments, we make use of a dataset of 141\nsubjects (44 controls and 97 patients with MS). We show that all the tested\ndeep learning (DL) methods outperform FreeSurfer (Dice around 0.7 for DL vs\n0.33 for FreeSurfer). Axial-MLP is competitive with U-Nets even though it is\nslightly less accurate. The conclusions of our paper are two-fold: 1) the\nstudied deep learning methods could be useful tools to study CP in large\ncohorts of MS patients; 2)~Axial-MLP is a potentially viable alternative to\nconvolutional neural networks for such tasks, although it could benefit from\nfurther improvements.",

    "abstract": "Analog over-the-air computation (OAC) is an efficient solution to a class of\nuplink data aggregation tasks over a multiple-access channel (MAC), wherein the\nreceiver, dubbed the fusion center, aims to reconstruct a function of the data\ndistributed at edge devices rather than the individual data themselves.\nExisting OAC relies exclusively on the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation at\nthe fusion center to recover the arithmetic sum of the transmitted signals from\ndifferent devices. ML estimation, however, is much susceptible to noise. In\nparticular, in the misaligned OAC where there are channel misalignments among\ntransmitted signals, ML estimation suffers from severe error propagation and\nnoise enhancement. To address these challenges, this paper puts forth a\nBayesian approach for OAC by letting each edge device transmit two pieces of\nprior information to the fusion center. Three OAC systems are studied: the\naligned OAC with perfectly-aligned signals; the synchronous OAC with misaligned\nchannel gains among the received signals; and the asynchronous OAC with both\nchannel-gain and time misalignments. Using the prior information, we devise\nlinear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimators and a sum-product maximum\na posteriori (SP-MAP) estimator for the three OAC systems. Numerical results\nverify that, 1) For the aligned and synchronous OAC, our LMMSE estimator\nsignificantly outperforms the ML estimator. In the low signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) regime, the LMMSE estimator reduces the mean squared error (MSE) by at\nleast 6 dB; in the high SNR regime, the LMMSE estimator lowers the error floor\non the MSE by 86.4%; 2) For the asynchronous OAC, our LMMSE and SP-MAP\nestimators are on an equal footing in terms of the MSE performance, and are\nsignificantly better than the ML estimator.",

Along with this trend,\nthere emerge quantum neural architectures based on different designs of quantum\nneurons. A fundamental question in quantum deep learning arises: what is the\nbest quantum neural architecture? Inspired by the design of neural\narchitectures for classical computing which typically employs multiple types of\nneurons, this paper makes the very first attempt to mix quantum neuron designs\nto build quantum neural architectures. We observe that the existing quantum\nneuron designs may be quite different but complementary, such as neurons from\nvariation quantum circuits (VQC) and Quantumflow. More specifically, VQC can\napply real-valued weights but suffer from being extended to multiple layers,\nwhile QuantumFlow can build a multi-layer network efficiently, but is limited\nto use binary weights. To take their respective advantages, we propose to mix\nthem together and figure out a way to connect them seamlessly without\nadditional costly measurement. We further investigate the design principles to\nmix quantum neurons, which can provide guidance for quantum neural architecture\nexploration in the future. Experimental results demonstrate that the identified\nquantum neural architectures with mixed quantum neurons can achieve 90.62% of\naccuracy on the MNIST dataset, compared with 52.77% and 69.92% on the VQC and\nQuantumFlow, respectively.",
