    "title": "Challenges in Generalization in Open Domain Question Answering",
    "abstract": "Recent work on Open Domain Question Answering has shown that there is a large\ndiscrepancy in model performance between novel test questions and those that\nlargely overlap with training questions. However, it is as of yet unclear which\naspects of novel questions that make them challenging. Drawing upon studies on\nsystematic generalization, we introduce and annotate questions according to\nthree categories that measure different levels and kinds of generalization:\ntraining set overlap, compositional generalization (comp-gen), and novel entity\ngeneralization (novel-entity). When evaluating six popular parametric and\nnon-parametric models, we find that for the established Natural Questions and\nTriviaQA datasets, even the strongest model performance for\ncomp-gen/novel-entity is 13.1/5.4% and 9.6/1.5% lower compared to that for the\nfull test set -- indicating the challenge posed by these types of questions.\nFurthermore, we show that whilst non-parametric models can handle questions\ncontaining novel entities, they struggle with those requiring compositional\ngeneralization. Through thorough analysis we find that key question difficulty\nfactors are: cascading errors from the retrieval component, frequency of\nquestion pattern, and frequency of the entity.",

    "abstract": "Nonlinear energy functionals appearing in the calculus of variations can be\ndiscretized by the finite element (FE) method and formulated as a sum of energy\ncontributions from local elements. A fast evaluation of energy functionals\ncontaining the first order gradient terms is a central part of this\ncontribution. We describe a vectorized implementation using the simplest P1\nelements in which all energy contributions are evaluated all at once without\nthe loop over triangular or tetrahedral elements. Furthermore, in connection to\nthe first-order optimization methods, the discrete gradient of the energy\nfunctional is assembled in a way that gradient components are evaluated over\nall degrees of freedom all at once. The key ingredient is the vectorization of\nexact or approximate energy gradients over nodal patches. It leads to a\ntime-efficient implementation at higher memory-cost.

    "abstract": "We investigate whether model extraction can be used to \"steal\" the weights of\nsequential recommender systems, and the potential threats posed to victims of\nsuch attacks. This type of risk has attracted attention in image and text\nclassification, but to our knowledge not in recommender systems. We argue that\nsequential recommender systems are subject to unique vulnerabilities due to the\nspecific autoregressive regimes used to train them. Unlike many existing\nrecommender attackers, which assume the dataset used to train the victim model\nis exposed to attackers, we consider a data-free setting, where training data\nare not accessible. Under this setting, we propose an API-based model\nextraction method via limited-budget synthetic data generation and knowledge\ndistillation. We investigate state-of-the-art models for sequential\nrecommendation and show their vulnerability under model extraction and\ndownstream attacks. We perform attacks in two stages. (1) Model extraction:\ngiven different types of synthetic data and their labels retrieved from a\nblack-box recommender, we extract the black-box model to a white-box model via\ndistillation. (2) Downstream attacks: we attack the black-box model with\nadversarial samples generated by the white-box recommender. Experiments show\nthe effectiveness of our data-free model extraction and downstream attacks on\nsequential recommenders in both profile pollution and data poisoning settings.",

    "abstract": "Message queuing brokers are a fundamental building block of the Internet of\nThings, commonly used to store and forward messages from publishing clients to\nsubscribing clients. Often a single trusted broker offers secured (e.g. TLS)\nand unsecured connections but relays messages regardless of their inbound and\noutbound protection. Such mixed mode is facilitated for the sake of efficiency\nsince TLS is quite a burden for MQTT implementations on class-0 IoT devices.\nSuch a broker thus transparently interconnects securely and insecurely\nconnected devices; we argue that such mixed mode operation can actually be a\nsignificant security problem: Clients can only control the security level of\ntheir own connection to the broker, but they cannot enforce any protection\ntowards other clients. We describe an enhancement of such a publish/subscribe\nmechanism to allow for enforcing specified security levels of publishers or\nsubscribers by only forwarding messages via connections which satisfy the\ndesired security levels. For example, a client publishing a message over a\nsecured channel can instruct the broker to forward the message exclusively to\nsubscribers that are securely connected. We prototypically implemented our\nsolution for the MQTT protocol and provide detailed overhead measurements.",

    "abstract": "Simulation of human soft tissues in contact with their environment is\nessential in many fields, including visual effects and apparel design.\nBiological tissues are nearly incompressible. However, standard methods employ\ncompressible elasticity models and achieve incompressibility indirectly by\nsetting Poisson's ratio to be close to 0.5. This approach can produce results\nthat are plausible qualitatively but inaccurate quantatively. This approach\nalso causes numerical instabilities and locking in coarse discretizations or\notherwise poses a prohibitive restriction on the size of the time step. We\npropose a novel approach to alleviate these issues by replacing indirect volume\npreservation using Poisson's ratios with direct enforcement of zonal volume\nconstraints, while controlling fine-scale volumetric deformation through a\ncell-wise compression penalty. To increase realism, we propose an epidermis\nmodel to mimic the dramatically higher surface stiffness on real skinned\nbodies. We demonstrate that our method produces stable realistic deformations\nwith precise volume preservation but without locking artifacts. Due to the\nvolume preservation not being tied to mesh discretization, our method also\nallows a resolution consistent simulation of incompressible materials. Our\nmethod improves the stability of the standard neo-Hookean model and the general\ncompression recovery in the Stable neo-Hookean model.",

    "abstract": "When numerical solution of elliptic and parabolic partial differential\nequations is required to be highly accurate in space, the discrete problem\nusually takes the form of large-scale and sparse linear systems. In this work,\nas an alternative, for spatial discretization we provide a Matrix-Oriented\nformulation of the classical Finite Element Method, called MO-FEM, of arbitrary\norder $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$. On structured 2D domains (e.g. squares or rectangles)\nthe discrete problem is then reformulated as a Sylvester matrix equation, that\nwe solve by the reduced approach in the associated spectral space. On a quite\ngeneral class of domains, namely normal domains, and even on special surfaces,\nthe MO-FEM yields a multiterm Sylvester matrix equation where the additional\nterms account for the geometric contribution of the domain shape. In\nparticular, we obtain a sequence of these equations after time discretization\nof parabolic problems by the IMEX Euler method. We apply the matrix-oriented\nform of the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (MO-PCG) method to solve each\nmultiterm Sylvester equation for MO-FEM of degree $k=1,\\dots,4$ and for the\nlumped $\\mathbb{P}_1$ case.

To model realistic social\ndynamics, MIRL methods must account for suboptimal human reasoning and\nbehavior. Traditional formalisms of game theory provide computationally\ntractable behavioral models, but assume agents have unrealistic cognitive\ncapabilities. This research identifies and compares mechanisms in MIRL methods\nwhich a) handle noise, biases and heuristics in agent decision making and b)\nmodel realistic equilibrium solution concepts. MIRL research is systematically\nreviewed to identify solutions for these challenges. The methods and results of\nthese studies are analyzed and compared based on factors including performance\naccuracy, efficiency, and descriptive quality. We found that the primary\nmethods for handling noise, biases and heuristics in MIRL were extensions of\nMaximum Entropy (MaxEnt) IRL to multi-agent settings. We also found that many\nsuccessful solution concepts are generalizations of the traditional Nash\nEquilibrium (NE). These solutions include the correlated equilibrium, logistic\nstochastic best response equilibrium and entropy regularized mean field NE.\nMethods which use recursive reasoning or updating also perform well, including\nthe feedback NE and archive multi-agent adversarial IRL. Success in modeling\nspecific biases and heuristics in single-agent IRL and promising results using\na Theory of Mind approach in MIRL imply that modeling specific biases and\nheuristics may be useful.

    "abstract": "Targets are essential in problems such as object tracking in cluttered or\ntextureless environments, camera (and multi-sensor) calibration tasks, and\nsimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Target shapes for these tasks\ntypically are symmetric (square, rectangular, or circular) and work well for\nstructured, dense sensor data such as pixel arrays (i.e., image). However,\nsymmetric shapes lead to pose ambiguity when using sparse sensor data such as\nLiDAR point clouds and suffer from the quantization uncertainty of the LiDAR.\nThis paper introduces the concept of optimizing target shape to remove pose\nambiguity for LiDAR point clouds. A target is designed to induce large\ngradients at edge points under rotation and translation relative to the LiDAR\nto ameliorate the quantization uncertainty associated with point cloud\nsparseness. Moreover, given a target shape, we present a means that leverages\nthe target's geometry to estimate the target's vertices while globally\nestimating the pose. Both the simulation and the experimental results (verified\nby a motion capture system) confirm that by using the optimal shape and the\nglobal solver, we achieve centimeter error in translation and a few degrees in\nrotation even when a partially illuminated target is placed 30 meters away.

    "abstract": "Video games remain largely inaccessible to visually impaired people (VIPs).\nToday's blind-accessible games are highly simplified renditions of what sighted\nplayers enjoy, and they do not give VIPs the same freedom to look around and\nexplore game worlds on their own terms. In this work, we introduce NavStick, an\naudio-based tool for looking around within virtual environments, with the aim\nof making 3D adventure video games more blind-accessible. NavStick repurposes a\ngame controller's thumbstick to allow VIPs to survey what is around them via\nline-of-sight. In a user study, we compare NavStick with traditional menu-based\nsurveying for different navigation tasks and find that VIPs were able to form\nmore accurate mental maps of their environment with NavStick than with\nmenu-based surveying. In an additional exploratory study, we investigate\nNavStick in the context of a representative 3D adventure game. Our findings\nreveal several implications for blind-accessible games, and we close by\ndiscussing these.",

    "title": "Byzantine Consensus in Directed Hypergraphs",
    "abstract": "Byzantine consensus is a classical problem in distributed computing. Each\nnode in a synchronous system starts with a binary input. The goal is to reach\nagreement in the presence of Byzantine faulty nodes. We consider the setting\nwhere communication between nodes is modelled via a directed hypergraph. In the\nclassical point-to-point communication model, the communication between nodes\nis modelled as a simple graph where all messages sent on an edge are private\nbetween the two endpoints of the edge. This allows a faulty node to equivocate,\ni.e., lie differently to its different neighbors. Different models have been\nproposed in the literature that weaken equivocation. In the local broadcast\nmodel, every message transmitted by a node is received identically and\ncorrectly by all of its neighbors. In the hypergraph model, every message\ntransmitted by a node on a hyperedge is received identically and correctly by\nall nodes on the hyperedge. Tight network conditions are known for each of the\nthree cases for undirected (hyper)graphs. For the directed models, tight\nconditions are known for the point-to-point and local broadcast models.\nIn this work, we consider the directed hypergraph model that encompasses all\nthe models above. Each directed hyperedge consists of a single head (sender)\nand at least one tail (receiver), This models a local multicast channel where\nmessages transmitted by the sender are received identically by all the\nreceivers in the hyperedge. For this model, we identify tight network\nconditions for consensus. We observe how the directed hypergraph model reduces\nto each of the three models above under specific conditions. In each case, we\nrelate our network condition to the corresponding known tight conditions. The\ndirected hypergraph model also encompasses other practical network models of\ninterest that have not been explored previously, as elaborated in the paper.",

Thus, it has\nbeen argued that prediction of upcoming words is a key component of language\ncomprehension, and that studying the amplitude of the N400 is a valuable way to\ninvestigate the predictions that we make. In this study, we investigate whether\nthe linguistic predictions of computational language models or humans better\nreflect the way in which natural language stimuli modulate the amplitude of the\nN400. One important difference in the linguistic predictions of humans versus\ncomputational language models is that while language models base their\npredictions exclusively on the preceding linguistic context, humans may rely on\nother factors. We find that the predictions of three top-of-the-line\ncontemporary language models - GPT-3, RoBERTa, and ALBERT - match the N400 more\nclosely than human predictions.

State estimation for locomotion over dynamic rigid surfaces\n(DRS), such as elevators, ships, public transport vehicles, and aircraft,\nremains under-explored, although state estimator designs for stationary rigid\nsurfaces have been extensively studied. Addressing DRS locomotion in state\nestimation is a challenging problem mainly due to the nonlinear, hybrid nature\nof walking dynamics, the nonstationary surface-foot contact points, and\nhardware imperfections (e.g., limited availability, noise, and drift of onboard\nsensors). Towards solving this problem, we introduce an Invariant Extended\nKalman Filter (InEKF) whose process and measurement models explicitly consider\nthe DRS movement and hybrid walking behaviors while respectively satisfying the\ngroup-affine condition and invariant form. Due to these attractive properties,\nthe estimation error convergence of the filter is provably guaranteed for\nhybrid DRS locomotion. The measurement model of the filter also exploits the\nholonomic constraint associated with the support-foot and surface orientations,\nunder which the robot's yaw angle in the world becomes observable in the\npresence of general DRS movement.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose and analyze a first-order and a second-order\ntime-stepping schemes for the anisotropic phase-field dendritic crystal growth\nmodel. The proposed schemes are based on an auxiliary variable approach for the\nAllen-Cahn equation and delicate treatment of the terms coupling the Allen-Cahn\nequation and temperature equation. The idea of the former is to introduce\nsuitable auxiliary variables to facilitate construction of high order stable\nschemes for a large class of gradient flows. We propose a new technique to\ntreat the coupling terms involved in the crystal growth model and introduce\nsuitable stabilization terms to result in totally decoupled schemes, which\nsatisfy a discrete energy law without affecting the convergence order. A\ndelicate implementation demonstrates that the proposed schemes can be realized\nin a very efficient way. That is, it only requires solving four linear elliptic\nequations and a simple algebraic equation at each time step. A detailed\ncomparison with existing schemes is given, and the advantage of the new schemes\nare emphasized. As far as we know this is the first second-order scheme that is\ntotally decoupled, linear, unconditionally stable for the dendritic crystal\ngrowth model with variable mobility parameter.",

    "abstract": "Most IT systems depend on a set of configuration variables (CVs), expressed\nas a name/value pair that collectively define the resource allocation for the\nsystem. While the ill-effects of misconfiguration or improper resource\nallocation are well-known, there is no effective a priori metric to quantify\nthe impact of the configuration on the desired system attributes such as\nperformance, availability, etc. In this paper, we propose a\n\\textit{Configuration Health Index} (CHI) framework specifically attuned to the\nperformance attribute to capture the influence of CVs on the performance\naspects of the system. We show how CHI, which is defined as a configuration\nscoring system, can take advantage of the domain knowledge and the available\n(but rather limited) performance data to produce important insights into the\nconfiguration settings. We compare the CHI with both well-advertised segmented\nnon-linear models and state-of-the-art data-driven models, and show that the\nCHI not only consistently provides better results but also avoids the dangers\nof pure data drive approach which may predict incorrect behavior or eliminate\nsome essential configuration variables from consideration.",

    "abstract": "While conventional reinforcement learning focuses on designing agents that\ncan perform one task, meta-learning aims, instead, to solve the problem of\ndesigning agents that can generalize to different tasks (e.g., environments,\nobstacles, and goals) that were not considered during the design or the\ntraining of these agents. In this spirit, in this paper, we consider the\nproblem of training a provably safe Neural Network (NN) controller for\nuncertain nonlinear dynamical systems that can generalize to new tasks that\nwere not present in the training data while preserving strong safety\nguarantees. Our approach is to learn a set of NN controllers during the\ntraining phase. When the task becomes available at runtime, our framework will\ncarefully select a subset of these NN controllers and compose them to form the\nfinal NN controller. Critical to our approach is the ability to compute a\nfinite-state abstraction of the nonlinear dynamical system. This abstract model\ncaptures the behavior of the closed-loop system under all possible NN weights,\nand is used to train the NNs and compose them when the task becomes available.\nWe provide theoretical guarantees that govern the correctness of the resulting\nNN. We evaluated our approach on the problem of controlling a wheeled robot in\ncluttered environments that were not present in the training data.",

    "abstract": "There is an opportunity in modern power systems to explore the demand\nflexibility by incentivizing consumers with dynamic prices. In this paper, we\nquantify demand flexibility using an efficient tool called time-varying\nelasticity, whose value may change depending on the prices and decision\ndynamics. This tool is particularly useful for evaluating the demand response\npotential and system reliability. Recent empirical evidences have highlighted\nsome abnormal features when studying demand flexibility, such as delayed\nresponses and vanishing elasticities after price spikes. Existing methods fail\nto capture these complicated features because they heavily rely on some\npredefined (often over-simplified) regression expressions. Instead, this paper\nproposes a model-free methodology to automatically and accurately derive the\noptimal estimation pattern. We further develop a two-stage estimation process\nwith Siamese long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Here, a LSTM network\nencodes the price response, while the other network estimates the time-varying\nelasticities. In the case study, the proposed framework and models are\nvalidated to achieve higher overall estimation accuracy and better description\nfor various abnormal features when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "title": "On the Accuracy of Analog Neural Network Inference Accelerators",
    "abstract": "Specialized accelerators have recently garnered attention as a method to\nreduce the power consumption of neural network inference. A promising category\nof accelerators utilizes nonvolatile memory arrays to both store weights and\nperform $\\textit{in situ}$ analog computation inside the array. While prior\nwork has explored the design space of analog accelerators to optimize\nperformance and energy efficiency, there is seldom a rigorous evaluation of the\naccuracy of these accelerators. This work shows how architectural design\ndecisions, particularly in mapping neural network parameters to analog memory\ncells, influence inference accuracy. When evaluated using ResNet50 on ImageNet,\nthe resilience of the system to analog non-idealities - cell programming\nerrors, analog-to-digital converter resolution, and array parasitic resistances\n- all improve when analog quantities in the hardware are made proportional to\nthe weights in the network. Moreover, contrary to the assumptions of prior\nwork, nearly equivalent resilience to cell imprecision can be achieved by fully\nstoring weights as analog quantities, rather than spreading weight bits across\nmultiple devices, often referred to as bit slicing. By exploiting\nproportionality, analog system designers have the freedom to match the\nprecision of the hardware to the needs of the algorithm, rather than attempting\nto guarantee the same level of precision in the intermediate results as an\nequivalent digital accelerator. This ultimately results in an analog\naccelerator that is more accurate, more robust to analog errors, and more\nenergy-efficient.",

Fortunately, there are usually\nrich unlabeled user behavior data which encode rich information of user\ncharacteristics and interests.

AdvTrojan is stealthy because it can be activated only when:\n1) a carefully crafted adversarial perturbation is injected into the input\nexamples during inference, and 2) a Trojan backdoor is implanted during the\ntraining process of the model. We leverage adversarial noise in the input space\nto move Trojan-infected examples across the model decision boundary, making it\ndifficult to detect. The stealthiness behavior of AdvTrojan fools the users\ninto accidentally trust the infected model as a robust classifier against\nadversarial examples. AdvTrojan can be implemented by only poisoning the\ntraining data similar to conventional Trojan backdoor attacks.

    "abstract": "A high order finite difference method is proposed for unstructured meshes to\nsimulate compressible inviscid/viscous flows with/without discontinuities. In\nthis method, based on the strong form equation, the divergence of the flux on\neach vertex is computed directly from fluxes nearby by means of high order\nleast-square. In order to capture discontinuities, numerical flux of high order\naccuracy is calculated on each edge and serves as supporting data of the\nleast-square computation of the divergence. The high accuracy of the numerical\nflux depends on the high order WENO interpolation on each edge. To reduce the\ncomputing cost and complexity, a curvlinear stencil is assembled for each edge\nso that the economical one-dimensional WENO interpolation can be applied. With\nthe derivatives introduced, two-dimensional Hermite interpolation on a\ncurvilinear stencil is applied to keep the stencil compact and avoids using\nmany supporting points. In smooth region, the Hermite least-square 2D\ninterpolation of 5 nodes is adopted directly to achieve the fifth order\naccuracy. Near a discontinuity, three values obtained by means of least-square\n2D interpolation of 3 nodes, are weighted to obtain one value of the second\norder accuracy. After obtaining the flow states on both sides of the middle\npoint of an edge, numerical flux of high order accuracy along the edge can be\ncalculated. For inviscid flux, analytical flux on vertices and numerical flux\nalong edges are used to compute the divergence. While for viscous flux, only\nanalytical viscous flux on vertices are used. The divergence of the fluxes and\ntheir derivatives on each vertex are used to update the conservative variables\nand their derivatives with an explicit Runger-Kutta time scheme. Several\ncanonical numerical cases were solved to test the accuracy and the capability\nof shock capturing of this method.",

    "abstract": "Semantic information provides intra-class consistency and inter-class\ndiscriminability beyond visual concepts, which has been employed in Few-Shot\nLearning (FSL) to achieve further gains. However, semantic information is only\navailable for labeled samples but absent for unlabeled samples, in which the\nembeddings are rectified unilaterally by guiding the few labeled samples with\nsemantics. Therefore, it is inevitable to bring a cross-modal bias between\nsemantic-guided samples and nonsemantic-guided samples, which results in an\ninformation asymmetry problem. To address this problem, we propose a\nModal-Alternating Propagation Network (MAP-Net) to supplement the absent\nsemantic information of unlabeled samples, which builds information symmetry\namong all samples in both visual and semantic modalities. Specifically, the\nMAP-Net transfers the neighbor information by the graph propagation to generate\nthe pseudo-semantics for unlabeled samples guided by the completed visual\nrelationships and rectify the feature embeddings. In addition, due to the large\ndiscrepancy between visual and semantic modalities, we design a Relation\nGuidance (RG) strategy to guide the visual relation vectors via semantics so\nthat the propagated information is more beneficial. Extensive experimental\nresults on three semantic-labeled datasets, i.e., Caltech-UCSD-Birds 200-2011,\nSUN Attribute Database, and Oxford 102 Flower, have demonstrated that our\nproposed method achieves promising performance and outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art approaches, which indicates the necessity of information\nsymmetry.",

    "abstract": "Since training a large-scale backdoored model from scratch requires a large\ntraining dataset, several recent attacks have considered to inject backdoors\ninto a trained clean model without altering model behaviors on the clean data.\nPrevious work finds that backdoors can be injected into a trained clean model\nwith Adversarial Weight Perturbation (AWP). Here AWPs refers to the variations\nof parameters that are small in backdoor learning. In this work, we observe an\ninteresting phenomenon that the variations of parameters are always AWPs when\ntuning the trained clean model to inject backdoors. We further provide\ntheoretical analysis to explain this phenomenon. We formulate the behavior of\nmaintaining accuracy on clean data as the consistency of backdoored models,\nwhich includes both global consistency and instance-wise consistency. We\nextensively analyze the effects of AWPs on the consistency of backdoored\nmodels. In order to achieve better consistency, we propose a novel anchoring\nloss to anchor or freeze the model behaviors on the clean data, with a\ntheoretical guarantee. Both the analytical and the empirical results validate\nthe effectiveness of the anchoring loss in improving the consistency,\nespecially the instance-wise consistency.",

    "abstract": "The domain shift between the source and target domain is the main challenge\nin Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL). However, the target domain is\nabsolutely unknown during the training on the source domain, which results in\nlacking directed guidance for target tasks. We observe that since there are\nsimilar backgrounds in target domains, it can apply self-labeled samples as\nprior tasks to transfer knowledge onto target tasks. To this end, we propose a\ntask-expansion-decomposition framework for CD-FSL, called Self-Taught (ST)\napproach, which alleviates the problem of non-target guidance by constructing\ntask-oriented metric spaces. Specifically, Weakly Supervised Object\nLocalization (WSOL) and self-supervised technologies are employed to enrich\ntask-oriented samples by exchanging and rotating the discriminative regions,\nwhich generates a more abundant task set. Then these tasks are decomposed into\nseveral tasks to finish the task of few-shot recognition and rotation\nclassification. It helps to transfer the source knowledge onto the target tasks\nand focus on discriminative regions. We conduct extensive experiments under the\ncross-domain setting including 8 target domains: CUB, Cars, Places, Plantae,\nCropDieases, EuroSAT, ISIC, and ChestX. Experimental results demonstrate that\nthe proposed ST approach is applicable to various metric-based models, and\nprovides promising improvements in CD-FSL.",

This leads to poor\naccuracy when downstream tasks, such as action recognition, depend on pose.\nEnd-to-end learning circumvents pose, but requires more labels to generalize.\nWe introduce Video Pose Distillation (VPD), a weakly-supervised technique to\nlearn features for new video domains, such as individual sports that challenge\npose estimation. Under VPD, a student network learns to extract robust pose\nfeatures from RGB frames in the sports video, such that, whenever pose is\nconsidered reliable, the features match the output of a pretrained teacher pose\ndetector. Our strategy retains the best of both pose and end-to-end worlds,\nexploiting the rich visual patterns in raw video frames, while learning\nfeatures that agree with the athletes' pose and motion in the target video\ndomain to avoid over-fitting to patterns unrelated to athletes' motion.\nVPD features improve performance on few-shot, fine-grained action\nrecognition, retrieval, and detection tasks in four real-world sports video\ndatasets, without requiring additional ground-truth pose annotations.",

    "abstract": "Background. Clustering analysis discovers hidden structures in a data set by\npartitioning them into disjoint clusters. Robust accuracy measures that\nevaluate the goodness of clustering results are critical for algorithm\ndevelopment and model diagnosis. Common problems of current clustering accuracy\nmeasures include overlooking unmatched clusters, biases towards excessive\nclusters, unstable baselines, and difficult interpretation. In this study, we\npresented a novel accuracy measure, J-score, that addresses these issues.\nMethods. Given a data set with known class labels, J-score quantifies how\nwell the hypothetical clusters produced by clustering analysis recover the true\nclasses. It starts with bidirectional set matching to identify the\ncorrespondence between true classes and hypothetical clusters based on Jaccard\nindex. It then computes two weighted sums of Jaccard indices measuring the\nreconciliation from classes to clusters and vice versa. The final J-score is\nthe harmonic mean of the two weighted sums.\nResults. Via simulation studies, we evaluated the performance of J-score and\ncompared with existing measures. Our results show that J-score is effective in\ndistinguishing partition structures that differ only by unmatched clusters,\nrewarding correct inference of class numbers, addressing biases towards\nexcessive clusters, and having a relatively stable baseline. The simplicity of\nits calculation makes the interpretation straightforward. It is a valuable tool\ncomplementary to other accuracy measures. We released an R/jScore package\nimplementing the algorithm.",

By\nusing n diagonal matrices along with a weight, the proposed method can reduce\nlighting effects on all spatially varying colors in an image under such\nillumination conditions. In contrast, conventional white balance adjustments do\nnot consider the correcting of all colors except under a single illuminant.\nAlso, multi-color balance adjustments can map multiple colors into\ncorresponding ground truth colors, although they may cause the rank deficiency\nproblem to occur as a non-diagonal matrix is used, unlike white balancing. In\nan experiment, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown under mixed\nand non-uniform illuminants, compared with conventional white and multi-color\nbalancing. Moreover, under a single illuminant, the proposed method has almost\nthe same performance as the conventional white balancing.",

    "abstract": "Neurons have a polarized structure, including dendrites and axons, and\ncompartment-specific functions can be affected by dwelling mitochondria. It is\nknown that the morphology of mitochondria is closely related to the functions\nof neurons and neurodegenerative diseases. Even though several deep learning\nmethods have been developed to automatically analyze the morphology of\nmitochondria, the application of existing methods to actual analysis still\nencounters several difficulties. Since the performance of pre-trained deep\nlearning model may vary depending on the target data, re-training of the model\nis often required. Besides, even though deep learning has shown superior\nperformance under a constrained setup, there are always errors that need to be\ncorrected by humans in real analysis. To address these issues, we introduce\nMitoVis, a novel visualization system for end-to-end data processing and\ninteractive analysis of the morphology of neuronal mitochondria. MitoVis\nenables interactive fine-tuning of a pre-trained neural network model without\nthe domain knowledge of machine learning, which allows neuroscientists to\neasily leverage deep learning in their research. MitoVis also provides novel\nvisual guides and interactive proofreading functions so that the users can\nquickly identify and correct errors in the result with minimal effort. We\ndemonstrate the usefulness and efficacy of the system via a case study\nconducted by a neuroscientist on a real analysis scenario. The result shows\nthat MitoVis allows up to 15x faster analysis with similar accuracy compared to\nthe fully manual analysis method.",

To support its human partner in complex tasks, the robot can share\ninformation that it knows.

The questions when and what\ntype of information the human needs, are addressed through the concept of\nTheory of Mind based Communication which selects information sharing actions\nbased on evaluation of relevance and an estimation of human beliefs. We\nintegrate this into a communication assistant to support humans in a\ncooperative setting and evaluate performance benefits.\nWe designed a human robot Sushi making task that is challenging for the human\nand generates different situations where humans are unaware and communication\ncould be beneficial. We evaluate the influence of the human centric\ncommunication concept on performance with a user study. Compared to the\ncondition without information exchange, assisted participants can recover from\nunawareness much earlier. The approach respects the costs of communication and\nbalances interruptions better than other approaches.

We propose a novel loss function, termed as CAM-loss, to\nconstrain the embedded feature maps with the class activation maps (CAMs) which\nindicate the spatially discriminative regions of an image for particular\ncategories. CAM-loss drives the backbone to express the features of target\ncategory and suppress the features of non-target categories or background, so\nas to obtain more discriminative feature representations. It can be simply\napplied in any CNN architecture with neglectable additional parameters and\ncalculations. Experimental results show that CAM-loss is applicable to a\nvariety of network structures and can be combined with mainstream\nregularization methods to improve the performance of image classification. The\nstrong generalization ability of CAM-loss is validated in the transfer learning\nand few shot learning tasks. Based on CAM-loss, we also propose a novel\nCAAM-CAM matching knowledge distillation method.

This introduces new risks for cyber attacks, which can compromise the\nsecurity and disrupt the functionality of these systems. It is therefore\nnecessary to build such systems with strong guarantees of resiliency against\ncyber attacks. One way to achieve this level of assurance is using formal\nverification, which provides proofs of system compliance with desired cyber\nsecurity properties. The use of Formal Methods (FM) in aspects of cyber\nsecurity and safety-critical systems are reviewed in this article. We split FM\ninto the three main classes: theorem proving, model checking and lightweight\nFM. To allow the different uses of FM to be compared, we define a common set of\nterms. We further develop categories based on the type of computing system FM\nare applied in. Solutions in each class and category are presented, discussed,\ncompared and summarised. We describe historical highlights and developments and\npresent a state-of-the-art review in the area of FM in cyber security. This\nreview is presented from the point of view of FM practitioners and researchers,\ncommenting on the trends in each of the classes and categories. This is\nachieved by considering all types of FM, several types of security and safety\ncritical systems and by structuring the taxonomy accordingly. The article hence\nprovides a comprehensive overview of FM and techniques available to system\ndesigners of security-critical systems, simplifying the process of choosing the\nright tool for the task.

In this article, we empirically compare two state-of-the-art\ncontrol frameworks: the nonlinear-model-predictive controller (NMPC) and the\ndifferential-flatness-based controller (DFBC), by tracking a wide variety of\nagile trajectories at speeds up to 72 km/h. The comparisons are performed in\nboth simulation and real-world environments to systematically evaluate both\nmethods from the aspect of tracking accuracy, robustness, and computational\nefficiency. We show the superiority of NMPC in tracking dynamically infeasible\ntrajectories, at the cost of higher computation time and risk of numerical\nconvergence issues. For both methods, we also quantitatively study the effect\nof adding an inner-loop controller using the incremental nonlinear dynamic\ninversion (INDI) method, and the effect of adding an aerodynamic drag model.\nOur real-world experiments, performed in one of the world's largest motion\ncapture systems, demonstrate more than 78% tracking error reduction of both\nNMPC and DFBC, indicating the necessity of using an inner-loop controller and\naerodynamic drag model for agile trajectory tracking.",

One such simple indicator is the number of highly cited\nresearchers, which can be used under the assumption that a research system that\nproduces and employs many highly cited researchers will be more successful than\nothers with fewer of them.

In this paper,\nwe study transfer learning from a Bayesian perspective, where a parametric\nstatistical model is used. Specifically, we study three variants of transfer\nlearning problems, instantaneous, online, and time-variant transfer learning.\nFor each problem, we define an appropriate objective function, and provide\neither exact expressions or upper bounds on the learning performance using\ninformation-theoretic quantities, which allow simple and explicit\ncharacterizations when the sample size becomes large. Furthermore, examples\nshow that the derived bounds are accurate even for small sample sizes.

Traditional\nmethods to acquire hand-eye coordination skills are typically conducted through\none-to-one instruction where trainees/trainers must wear protective helmets and\nconduct several hands-on tests with metal workpieces. This approach is\ninefficient as the harmful light emitted from the electric arc impedes the\nclose monitoring of the welding process (practitioners can only observe a small\nbright spot and most geometric information cannot be perceived). Some new\nteaching methods have introduced the use of virtual reality as a way to safely\nsimulate the process and visualize the geometry of the workpieces. However, the\nsynthetic nature of these simulators reduces the effectiveness of the\nplatforms. As a feasible solution to these problems, this work presents a new\nmulti-sensor teaching-learning interface composed of a HDR camera (to monitor\nthe welding spot in real-time), a depth sensor (to capture the scene's 3D\ngeometry), and a VR headset (to visualize the process safely). In contrast with\ntraditional systems, our new platform provides trainees with virtual cues of\nthe seam geometry, automatic spot tracking, and a performance score (useful for\ninstructors to assess the task). To validate the method's feasibility, we\nconducted a detailed experimental study with several teaching and learning\nwelding tasks, and compared its advantages with the current practice and\nvirtual welding solutions.",

In this\nwork, we look at the competences related to three core SMT components and find\nthat during training, NMT first focuses on learning target-side language\nmodeling, then improves translation quality approaching word-by-word\ntranslation, and finally learns more complicated reordering patterns.

However, there exist inherent problems associated\nwith depth images captured from a single view.

    "abstract": "We propose CX-ToM, short for counterfactual explanations with theory-of mind,\na new explainable AI (XAI) framework for explaining decisions made by a deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to the current methods in XAI\nthat generate explanations as a single shot response, we pose explanation as an\niterative communication process, i.e. dialog, between the machine and human\nuser. More concretely, our CX-ToM framework generates sequence of explanations\nin a dialog by mediating the differences between the minds of machine and human\nuser. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly\nmodeling human's intention, machine's mind as inferred by the human as well as\nhuman's mind as inferred by the machine. Moreover, most state-of-the-art XAI\nframeworks provide attention (or heat map) based explanations. In our work, we\nshow that these attention based explanations are not sufficient for increasing\nhuman trust in the underlying CNN model. In CX-ToM, we instead use\ncounterfactual explanations called fault-lines which we define as follows:\ngiven an input image I for which a CNN classification model M predicts class\nc_pred, a fault-line identifies the minimal semantic-level features (e.g.,\nstripes on zebra, pointed ears of dog), referred to as explainable concepts,\nthat need to be added to or deleted from I in order to alter the classification\ncategory of I by M to another specified class c_alt. We argue that, due to the\niterative, conceptual and counterfactual nature of CX-ToM explanations, our\nframework is practical and more natural for both expert and non-expert users to\nunderstand the internal workings of complex deep learning models. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative experiments verify our hypotheses, demonstrating\nthat our CX-ToM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art explainable AI\nmodels.",

This work focuses\non the e-commerce domain to explore methods of utilising such structured data\nto create language resources that may be used for product classification and\nlinking. We process billions of structured data points in the form of RDF\nn-quads, to create multi-million words of product-related corpora that are\nlater used in three different ways for creating of language resources: training\nword embedding models, continued pre-training of BERT-like language models, and\ntraining Machine Translation models that are used as a proxy to generate\nproduct-related keywords.

The other two methods however, are not as useful.

Predictive process analytics is a newly emerged\ndiscipline dedicated to providing business process intelligence in modern\norganisations. It uses event logs, which capture process execution traces in\nthe form of multi-dimensional sequence data, as the key input to train\npredictive models. These predictive models, often built upon deep learning\ntechniques, can be used to make predictions about the future states of business\nprocess execution.

We propose i) two types of attentions: event attention to\ncapture the impact of specific process events on a prediction, and attribute\nattention to reveal which attribute(s) of an event influenced the prediction;\nand ii) two attention mechanisms: shared attention mechanism and specialised\nattention mechanism to reflect different design decisions in when to construct\nattribute attention on individual input features (specialised) or using the\nconcatenated feature tensor of all input feature vectors (shared). These lead\nto two distinct attention-based models, and both are interpretable models that\nincorporate interpretability directly into the structure of a process\npredictive model.

    "abstract": "With the development of the fourth industrial revolution technology, the type\nand scope of use of drones are rapidly increasing. As interest in drones\nincreases, research on related security vulnerabilities is actively being\nconducted, and discussions on security measures have also been developed to\nprevent them. Military has established and applied various security measures\nfor this, and in particular, drones equipped with KCMVP-certified cryptographic\nmodules are required to be introduced as a way to protect data on the drone's\nwireless channels. However, despite being equipped with such a certified\ncryptographic module, the drone's operating environment and structural\nproperties have the potential to expose it to several security vulnerabilities.\nIn this paper, we present a theoretical model for these security\nvulnerabilities and measures to complement them.",

    "abstract": "The empirical results suggest that the learnability of a neural network is\ndirectly related to its size. To mathematically prove this, we borrow a tool in\ntopological algebra: Betti numbers to measure the topological geometric\ncomplexity of input data and the neural network. By characterizing the\nexpressive capacity of a neural network with its topological complexity, we\nconduct a thorough analysis and show that the network's expressive capacity is\nlimited by the scale of its layers. Further, we derive the upper bounds of the\nBetti numbers on each layer within the network. As a result, the problem of\narchitecture selection of a neural network is transformed to determining the\nscale of the network that can represent the input data complexity. With the\npresented results, the architecture selection of a fully connected network\nboils down to choosing a suitable size of the network such that it equips the\nBetti numbers that are not smaller than the Betti numbers of the input data. We\nperform the experiments on a real-world dataset MNIST and the results verify\nour analysis and conclusion. The code will be publicly available.",

Generally, implicit/semi-implicit schemes are\npreferred over explicit ones to improve stability and correctness. However,\nexisting semi-implicit methods are usually iterative and employ a\ngeneral-purpose solver, which may be sub-optimal for a specific class of PDEs.\nIn this paper, we propose a neural solver to learn an optimal iterative scheme\nin a data-driven fashion for any class of PDEs. Specifically, we modify a\nsingle iteration of a semi-implicit solver using a deep neural network. We\nprovide theoretical guarantees for the correctness and convergence of neural\nsolvers analogous to conventional iterative solvers. In addition to the\ncommonly used Dirichlet boundary condition, we adopt a diffuse domain approach\nto incorporate a diverse type of boundary conditions, e.g., Neumann. We show\nthat the proposed neural solver can go beyond linear PDEs and applies to a\nclass of non-linear PDEs, where the non-linear component is non-stiff. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our method on 2D and 3D scenarios. To this end, we\nshow how our model generalizes to parameter settings, which are different from\ntraining; and achieves faster convergence than semi-implicit schemes.",

Researchers are for example judged and compared by the amount and\nimpact of their publications and public figures are confronted by their posts\non social media platforms. Therefore, it is important that authorship\ninformation in frequently used web services and platforms is correct. The\nquestion whether a given document is written by a given author is commonly\nreferred to as authorship verification (AV). While AV is a widely investigated\nproblem in general, only few works consider settings where the documents are\nshort and written in a rather uniform style. This makes most approaches\nunpractical for online databases and knowledge graphs in the scholarly domain.\nHere, authorships of scientific publications have to be verified, often with\njust abstracts and titles available. To this point, we present our novel\napproach LG4AV which combines language models and graph neural networks for\nauthorship verification. By directly feeding the available texts in a\npre-trained transformer architecture, our model does not need any hand-crafted\nstylometric features that are not meaningful in scenarios where the writing\nstyle is, at least to some extent, standardized. By the incorporation of a\ngraph neural network structure, our model can benefit from relations between\nauthors that are meaningful with respect to the verification process. For\nexample, scientific authors are more likely to write about topics that are\naddressed by their co-authors and twitter users tend to post about the same\nsubjects as people they follow.

Using\nfeature vectors (graph descriptors) in tandem with data mining algorithms that\noperate on Euclidean data, one can solve problems such as classification,\nclustering, and anomaly detection on graph-structured data. This idea has\nproved fruitful in the past, with spectral-based graph descriptors providing\nstate-of-the-art classification accuracy on benchmark datasets. However, these\nalgorithms do not scale to large graphs since: 1) they require storing the\nentire graph in memory, and 2) the end-user has no control over the algorithm's\nruntime.

Operating on edge streams allows us to avoid keeping the entire graph in\nmemory, and controlling the sample size enables us to control the time taken by\nthe algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of our descriptors by analyzing the\napproximation error, classification accuracy, and scalability to massive\ngraphs.

    "abstract": "Supervised image classification problems rely on training data assumed to\nhave been correctly annotated; this assumption underpins most works in the\nfield of deep learning. In consequence, during its training, a network is\nforced to match the label provided by the annotator and is not given the\nflexibility to choose an alternative to inconsistencies that it might be able\nto detect. Therefore, erroneously labeled training images may end up\n``correctly'' classified in classes which they do not actually belong to. This\nmay reduce the performances of the network and thus incite to build more\ncomplex networks without even checking the quality of the training data. In\nthis work, we question the reliability of the annotated datasets. For that\npurpose, we introduce the notion of ghost loss, which can be seen as a regular\nloss that is zeroed out for some predicted values in a deterministic way and\nthat allows the network to choose an alternative to the given label without\nbeing penalized. After a proof of concept experiment, we use the ghost loss\nprinciple to detect confusing images and erroneously labeled images in\nwell-known training datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10) and we\nprovide a new tool, called sanity matrix, for summarizing these confusions.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of misleading or false information spread by untrustworthy\nwebsites has emerged as a significant concern on the public agenda in many\ncountries, including Slovakia. Despite the influence ascribed to such websites,\ntheir transparency and accountability remain an issue in most cases, with\npublished work on mapping the administrators and connections of untrustworthy\nwebsites remaining limited. This article contributes to this body of knowledge\n(i) by providing an effective open-source tool to uncover untrustworthy website\nnetworks based on the utilization of the same Google Analytics/AdSense IDs,\nwith the added ability to expose networks based on historical data, and (ii) by\nproviding insight into the Slovak untrustworthy website landscape through\ndelivering a first of its kind mapping of Slovak untrustworthy website\nnetworks. Our approach is based on a mix-method design employing a qualitative\nexploration of data collected in a two wave study conducted in 2019 and 2021,\nutilizing a custom-coded tool to uncover website connections. Overall, the\nstudy succeeds in exposing multiple novel website ties. Our findings indicate\nthat while some untrustworthy website networks have been found to operate in\nthe Slovak infosphere, most researched websites appear to be run by multiple\nmutually unconnected administrators. The resulting data also demonstrates that\nuntrustworthy Slovak websites display a high content diversity in terms of\nconnected websites, ranging from websites of local NGOs, an e-shop selling\nunderwear to a matchmaking portal.",

In this paper, we design a novel framework for unsupervised lidar\nodometry with the IMU, which is never used in other deep methods. First, a pair\nof siamese LSTMs are used to obtain the initial pose from the linear\nacceleration and angular velocity of IMU. With the initial pose, we perform the\nrigid transform on the current frame and align it closer to the last frame.\nThen, we extract vertex and normal features from the transformed point clouds\nand its normals.

Finally, our model outputs the sum of initial and\nresidual poses as the final pose. For unsupervised training, we introduce an\nunsupervised loss function which is employed on the voxelized point clouds.

CACC\nincreases traffic throughput and safety, and decreases fuel consumption.\nHowever, the surge of vehicle connectivity has brought new security challenges\nas vehicular networks increasingly serve as new access points for adversaries\ntrying to deteriorate the platooning performance or even cause collisions.

However, it builds upon the\nassumption that the data distribution is stationary, ie. that the data is\nsampled from a fixed distribution both at training and test time. This way of\ntraining is inconsistent with how we as humans are able to learn from and\noperate within a constantly changing stream of information. Moreover, it is\nill-adapted to real-world use cases where the data distribution is expected to\nshift over the course of a model's lifetime.\nThe first goal of this thesis is to characterize the different forms this\nshift can take in the context of natural language processing, and propose\nbenchmarks and evaluation metrics to measure its effect on current deep\nlearning architectures. We then proceed to take steps to mitigate the effect of\ndistributional shift on NLP models. To this end, we develop methods based on\nparametric reformulations of the distributionally robust optimization\nframework. Empirically, we demonstrate that these approaches yield more robust\nmodels as demonstrated on a selection of realistic problems. In the third and\nfinal part of this thesis, we explore ways of efficiently adapting existing\nmodels to new domains or tasks.

    "abstract": "In the framework of convolutional neural networks, downsampling is often\nperformed with an average-pooling, where all the activations are treated\nequally, or with a max-pooling operation that only retains an element with\nmaximum activation while discarding the others. Both of these operations are\nrestrictive and have previously been shown to be sub-optimal. To address this\nissue, a novel pooling scheme, named\\emph{ ordinal pooling}, is introduced in\nthis work. Ordinal pooling rearranges all the elements of a pooling region in a\nsequence and assigns a different weight to each element based upon its order in\nthe sequence. These weights are used to compute the pooling operation as a\nweighted sum of the rearranged elements of the pooling region. They are learned\nvia a standard gradient-based training, allowing to learn a behavior anywhere\nin the spectrum of average-pooling to max-pooling in a differentiable manner.\nOur experiments suggest that it is advantageous for the networks to perform\ndifferent types of pooling operations within a pooling layer and that a hybrid\nbehavior between average- and max-pooling is often beneficial. More\nimportantly, they also demonstrate that ordinal pooling leads to consistent\nimprovements in the accuracy over average- or max-pooling operations while\nspeeding up the training and alleviating the issue of the choice of the pooling\noperations and activation functions to be used in the networks. In particular,\nordinal pooling mainly helps on lightweight or quantized deep learning\narchitectures, as typically considered e.g. for embedded applications.",

These methods\nestimate the pose of a given query image, i.e. the current observation of the\nground from a downward-facing camera, in respect to a set of reference images\nwhose poses are known in the application area. In this work, we deal with the\ninitial localization task, in which we have no prior knowledge about the\ncurrent robot positioning. In this situation, the localization method would\nhave to consider all available reference images. However, in order to reduce\ncomputational effort and the risk of receiving a wrong result, we would like to\nconsider only those reference images that are actually overlapping with the\nquery image. For this purpose, we propose a deep metric learning approach that\nretrieves the most similar reference images to the query image. In contrast to\nexisting approaches to image retrieval for ground images, our approach achieves\nsignificantly better recall performance and improves the localization\nperformance of a state-of-the-art ground texture based localization method.",

    "abstract": "Success of deep neural networks in diverse tasks across domains of computer\nvision, speech recognition and natural language processing, has necessitated\nunderstanding the dynamics of training process and also working of trained\nmodels. Two independent contributions of this paper are 1) Novel activation\nfunction for faster training convergence 2) Systematic pruning of filters of\nmodels trained irrespective of activation function. We analyze the topological\ntransformation of the space of training samples as it gets transformed by each\nsuccessive layer during training, by changing the activation function. The\nimpact of changing activation function on the convergence during training is\nreported for the task of binary classification. A novel activation function\naimed at faster convergence for classification tasks is proposed. Here, Betti\nnumbers are used to quantify topological complexity of data. Results of\nexperiments on popular synthetic binary classification datasets with large\nBetti numbers(>150) using MLPs are reported. Results show that the proposed\nactivation function results in faster convergence requiring fewer epochs by a\nfactor of 1.5 to 2, since Betti numbers reduce faster across layers with the\nproposed activation function. The proposed methodology was verified on\nbenchmark image datasets: fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10 and cat-vs-dog images, using\nCNNs. Based on empirical results, we propose a novel method for pruning a\ntrained model. The trained model was pruned by eliminating filters that\ntransform data to a topological space with large Betti numbers. All filters\nwith Betti numbers greater than 300 were removed from each layer without\nsignificant reduction in accuracy. This resulted in faster prediction time and\nreduced memory size of the model.",

In an attempt to resolve this apparent\ndiscrepancy between theory and practice, theorists have proposed the study of\nthese solvers as proof systems that would enable establishing appropriate lower\nand upper bounds on their complexity. For example, in recent years it has been\nshown that (idealized models of) SAT solvers are polynomially equivalent to the\ngeneral resolution proof system for propositional logic, and SMT solvers that\nuse the CDCL(T) architecture are polynomially equivalent to the Res*(T) proof\nsystem. In this paper, we extend this program to the MCSAT approach for SMT\nsolving by showing that the MCSAT architecture is polynomially equivalent to\nthe Res*(T) proof system. Thus, we establish an equivalence between CDCL(T) and\nMCSAT from a proof-complexity theoretic point of view.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of modifying/replacing the shape style of a real\nmoving character with those of an arbitrary static real source character.\nTraditional solutions follow a pose transfer strategy, from the moving\ncharacter to the source character shape, that relies on skeletal pose\nparametrization. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that\ntransfers the source shape style onto the moving character. The expected\nbenefit is to avoid the inherently difficult pose to shape conversion required\nwith skeletal parametrization applied on real characters. To this purpose, we\nconsider image style transfer techniques and investigate how to adapt them to\n3D human shapes. Adaptive Instance Normalisation (AdaIN) and SPADE\narchitectures have been demonstrated to efficiently and accurately transfer the\nstyle of an image onto another while preserving the original image structure.\nWhere AdaIN contributes with a module to perform style transfer through the\nstatistics of the subjects and SPADE contribute with a residual block\narchitecture to refine the quality of the style transfer. We demonstrate that\nthese approaches are extendable to the 3D shape domain by proposing a\nconvolutional neural network that applies the same principle of preserving the\nshape structure (shape pose) while transferring the style of a new subject\nshape. The generated results are supervised through a discriminator module to\nevaluate the realism of the shape, whilst enforcing the decoder to synthesise\nplausible shapes and improve the style transfer for unseen subjects. Our\nexperiments demonstrate an average of $\\approx 56\\%$ qualitative and\nquantitative improvements over the baseline in shape transfer through\noptimization-based and learning-based methods.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of human deformation transfer, where the goal is to\nretarget poses between different characters. Traditional methods that tackle\nthis problem require a clear definition of the pose, and use this definition to\ntransfer poses between characters. In this work, we take a different approach\nand transform the identity of a character into a new identity without modifying\nthe character's pose. This offers the advantage of not having to define\nequivalences between 3D human poses, which is not straightforward as poses tend\nto change depending on the identity of the character performing them, and as\ntheir meaning is highly contextual. To achieve the deformation transfer, we\npropose a neural encoder-decoder architecture where only identity information\nis encoded and where the decoder is conditioned on the pose. We use pose\nindependent representations, such as isometry-invariant shape characteristics,\nto represent identity features. Our model uses these features to supervise the\nprediction of offsets from the deformed pose to the result of the transfer. We\nshow experimentally that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods both\nquantitatively and qualitatively, and generalises better to poses not seen\nduring training.

However, they still have a certain restriction, which is\nthe sole usage of a single nodal operator for all (synaptic) connections of\neach neuron. The idea behind the \"generative neurons\" was born as a remedy for\nthis restriction where each nodal operator can be \"customized\" during the\ntraining in order to maximize the learning performance. Self-Organized ONNs\n(Self-ONNs) composed with the generative neurons can achieve an utmost level of\ndiversity even with a compact configuration; however, it still suffers from the\nlast property that was inherited from the CNNs: localized kernel operations\nwhich imposes a severe limitation to the information flow between layers. It\nis, therefore, desirable for the neurons to gather information from a larger\narea in the previous layer maps without increasing the kernel size. For certain\napplications, it might be even more desirable \"to learn\" the kernel locations\nof each connection during the training process along with the customized nodal\noperators so that both can be optimized simultaneously. This study introduces\nthe super (generative) neuron models that can accomplish this without altering\nthe kernel sizes and will enable a significant diversity in terms of\ninformation flow. The two models of super neurons proposed in this study vary\non the localization process of the kernels: i) randomly localized kernels\nwithin a bias range set for each layer, ii) optimized locations of each kernel\nduring the Back-Propagation (BP) training.

    "abstract": "Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are used to describe a wide variety\nof complex stochastic dynamical systems. Learning the hidden physics within\nSDEs is crucial for unraveling fundamental understanding of the stochastic and\nnonlinear behavior of these systems. We propose a flexible and scalable\nframework for training deep neural networks to learn constitutive equations\nthat represent hidden physics within SDEs. The proposed stochastic\nphysics-informed neural network framework (SPINN) relies on uncertainty\npropagation and moment-matching techniques along with state-of-the-art deep\nlearning strategies. SPINN first propagates stochasticity through the known\nstructure of the SDE (i.e., the known physics) to predict the time evolution of\nstatistical moments of the stochastic states. SPINN learns (deep) neural\nnetwork representations of the hidden physics by matching the predicted moments\nto those estimated from data. Recent advances in automatic differentiation and\nmini-batch gradient descent are leveraged to establish the unknown parameters\nof the neural networks. We demonstrate SPINN on three benchmark in-silico case\nstudies and analyze the framework's robustness and numerical stability. SPINN\nprovides a promising new direction for systematically unraveling the hidden\nphysics of multivariate stochastic dynamical systems with multiplicative noise.",

    "abstract": "Cities worldwide struggle with overloaded transportation systems and their\nexternalities, such as traffic congestion and emissions. The emerging\nautonomous transportation technology has a potential to alleviate these issues.\nYet, the decisions of profit-maximizing operators running large autonomous\nfleets could have a negative impact on other stakeholders, e.g., by\ndisproportionately cannibalizing public transport, and therefore could make the\ntransportation system even less efficient and sustainable. A careful analysis\nof these tradeoffs requires modeling the main modes of transportation,\nincluding public transport, within a unified framework. In this paper, we\npropose such a framework, which allows us to study the interplay among mobility\nservice providers, public transport authorities, and customers. Our framework\ncombines a graph-theoretic network model for the transportation system with a\ngame-theoretic market model in which mobility service providers are\nprofit-maximizers, while customers select individually-optimal transportation\noptions. We apply our framework to data for the city of Berlin, Germany, and\npresent sensitivity analyses to study parameters that mobility service\nproviders or municipalities can influence to steer the system. We show that\ndepending on market conditions and policy restrictions, autonomous ride-hailing\nsystems may complement or cannibalize a public transportation system, serving\nbetween 7% and 80% of all customers. We discuss the main factors behind\ndifferences in these outcomes as well as strategic design options available to\npolicymakers. Among others, we show that the monopolistic and the competitive\ncases yield similar modal shares, but differ in the profit outcome of each\nmobility service provider.",

We introduce a\nheavy-hitter algorithm that gives a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation to each of the\nreported frequencies in the sliding window model, thus obtaining the first\nalgorithm for general symmetric norm estimation in the sliding window model.\nOur algorithm is a universal sketch that simultaneously approximates all\nsymmetric norms in a parametrizable class and also improves upon the smooth\nhistogram framework for estimating $L_p$ norms, for a range of large $p$.\nFinally, we consider the problem of overconstrained linear regression problem\nin the case that loss function that is an Orlicz norm, a symmetric norm that\ncan be interpreted as a scale-invariant version of $M$-estimators.

However, there is a\nrich space of commonsense inferences anchored to knowledge about specific\nentities: for example, deciding the truthfulness of a claim \"Harry Potter can\nteach classes on how to fly on a broomstick.\" Can models learn to combine\nentity knowledge with commonsense reasoning in this fashion? We introduce\nCREAK, a testbed for commonsense reasoning about entity knowledge, bridging\nfact-checking about entities (Harry Potter is a wizard and is skilled at riding\na broomstick) with commonsense inferences (if you're good at a skill you can\nteach others how to do it). Our dataset consists of 13k human-authored English\nclaims about entities that are either true or false, in addition to a small\ncontrast set. Crowdworkers can easily come up with these statements and human\nperformance on the dataset is high (high 90s); we argue that models should be\nable to blend entity knowledge and commonsense reasoning to do well here. In\nour experiments, we focus on the closed-book setting and observe that a\nbaseline model finetuned on existing fact verification benchmark struggles on\nCREAK. Training a model on CREAK improves accuracy by a substantial margin, but\nstill falls short of human performance.

    "abstract": "Both single-agent and multi-agent actor-critic algorithms are an important\nclass of Reinforcement Learning algorithms. In this work, we propose three\nfully decentralized multi-agent natural actor-critic (MAN) algorithms. The\nagents' objective is to collectively learn a joint policy that maximizes the\nsum of averaged long-term returns of these agents. In the absence of a central\ncontroller, agents communicate the information to their neighbors via a\ntime-varying communication network while preserving privacy. We prove the\nconvergence of all the 3 MAN algorithms to a globally asymptotically stable\npoint of the ODE corresponding to the actor update; these use linear function\napproximations. We use the Fisher information matrix to obtain the natural\ngradients. The Fisher information matrix captures the curvature of the\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between polices at successive iterates. We\nalso show that the gradient of this KL divergence between policies of\nsuccessive iterates is proportional to the objective function's gradient. Our\nMAN algorithms indeed use this \\emph{representation} of the objective\nfunction's gradient. Under certain conditions on the Fisher information matrix,\nwe prove that at each iterate, the optimal value via MAN algorithms can be\nbetter than that of the multi-agent actor-critic (MAAC) algorithm using the\nstandard gradients. To validate the usefulness of our proposed algorithms, we\nimplement all the 3 MAN algorithms on a bi-lane traffic network to reduce the\naverage network congestion. We observe an almost 25% reduction in the average\ncongestion in 2 MAN algorithms; the average congestion in another MAN algorithm\nis on par with the MAAC algorithm. We also consider a generic 15 agent MARL;\nthe performance of the MAN algorithms is again as good as the MAAC algorithm.\nWe attribute the better performance of the MAN algorithms to their use of the\nabove representation.",

    "abstract": "It's well-known that inverse problems are ill-posed and to solve them\nmeaningfully, one has to employ regularization methods. Traditionally, popular\nregularization methods are the penalized Variational approaches. In recent\nyears, the classical regularization approaches have been outclassed by the\nso-called plug-and-play (PnP) algorithms, which copy the proximal gradient\nminimization processes, such as ADMM or FISTA, but with any general denoiser.\nHowever, unlike the traditional proximal gradient methods, the theoretical\nunderpinnings, convergence, and stability results have been insufficient for\nthese PnP-algorithms. Hence, the results obtained from these algorithms, though\nempirically outstanding, can't always be completely trusted, as they may\ncontain certain instabilities or (hallucinated) features arising from the\ndenoiser, especially when using a pre-trained learned denoiser. In fact, in\nthis paper, we show that a PnP-algorithm can induce hallucinated features, when\nusing a pre-trained deep-learning-based (DnCNN) denoiser. We show that such\ninstabilities are quite different than the instabilities inherent to an\nill-posed problem. We also present methods to subdue these instabilities and\nsignificantly improve the recoveries. We compare the advantages and\ndisadvantages of a learned denoiser over a classical denoiser (here, BM3D), as\nwell as, the effectiveness of the FISTA-PnP algorithm vs. the ADMM-PnP\nalgorithm. In addition, we also provide an algorithm to combine these two\ndenoisers, the learned and the classical, in a weighted fashion to produce even\nbetter results.

Whereas a large body\nof literature reveals substantial agreement about the existence of a unique\nprocess characterizing neuronal activity across organisms, the dynamics of\ninformation in online social media is far less understood. Statistical laws of\ninformation avalanches are found in previous studies to be not robust across\nsystems, and radically different processes are used to represent plausible\ndriving mechanisms for information propagation. Here, we analyze almost 1\nbillion time-stamped events collected from a multitude of online platforms --\nincluding Telegram, Twitter and Weibo -- over observation windows longer than\n10 years to show that the propagation of information in social media is a\nuniversal and critical process. Universality arises from the observation of\nidentical macroscopic patterns across platforms, irrespective of the details of\nthe specific system at hand. Critical behavior is deduced from the power-law\ndistributions, and corresponding hyperscaling relations, characterizing size\nand duration of avalanches of information. Neuronal activity may be modeled as\na simple contagion process, where only a single exposure to activity may be\nsufficient for its diffusion. On the contrary, statistical testing on our data\nindicates that a mixture of simple and complex contagion, where involvement of\nan individual requires exposure from multiple acquaintances, characterizes the\npropagation of information in social media. We show that the complexity of the\nprocess is correlated with the semantic content of the information that is\npropagated.

    "abstract": "The limitations of centralized optimization methods in managing power\ndistribution systems operations motivate distributed control and optimization\nalgorithms. However, the existing distributed optimization algorithms are\ninefficient in managing fast varying phenomena, resulting from highly variable\ndistributed energy resources (DERs). Related online distributed control methods\nare equally limited in their applications. They require thousands of time-steps\nto track the network-level optimal solutions, resulting in slow performance. We\nhave previously developed an online distributed controller that leverages the\nsystem's radial topology to achieve network-level optimal solutions within a\nfew time steps. However, it requires solving a node-level nonlinear programming\nproblem at each time step. This paper analyzes the solution space for the\nnode-level optimization problem and derives the analytical closed-form\nsolutions for the decision variables. The theoretical analysis of the\nnode-level optimization problem and obtained closed-form optimal solutions\neliminate the need for embedded optimization solvers at each distributed agent\nand significantly reduce the computational time and optimization costs.",

For the purpose of improving\nthe performance of non-intrusive load decomposition, a non-intrusive load\ndecomposition method based on a hybrid deep learning model is proposed. In this\nmethod, first of all, the data set is normalized and preprocessed. Secondly, a\nhybrid deep learning model integrating convolutional neural network (CNN) with\nlong short-term memory network (LSTM) is constructed to fully excavate the\nspatial and temporal characteristics of load data. Finally, different\nevaluation indicators are used to analyze the mixture. The model is fully\nevaluated, and contrasted with the traditional single deep learning model.\nExperimental results on the open dataset UK-DALE show that the proposed\nalgorithm improves the performance of the whole network system. In this paper,\nthe proposed decomposition method is compared with the existing traditional\ndeep learning load decomposition method. At the same time, compared with the\nobtained methods: spectral decomposition, EMS, LSTM-RNN, and other algorithms,\nthe accuracy of load decomposition is significantly improved, and the test\naccuracy reaches 98%.",

    "abstract": "Crop type mapping at the field level is critical for a variety of\napplications in agricultural monitoring, and satellite imagery is becoming an\nincreasingly abundant and useful raw input from which to create crop type maps.\nStill, in many regions crop type mapping with satellite data remains\nconstrained by a scarcity of field-level crop labels for training supervised\nclassification models. When training data is not available in one region,\nclassifiers trained in similar regions can be transferred, but shifts in the\ndistribution of crop types as well as transformations of the features between\nregions lead to reduced classification accuracy. We present a methodology that\nuses aggregate-level crop statistics to correct the classifier by accounting\nfor these two types of shifts. To adjust for shifts in the crop type\ncomposition we present a scheme for properly reweighting the posterior\nprobabilities of each class that are output by the classifier. To adjust for\nshifts in features we propose a method to estimate and remove linear shifts in\nthe mean feature vector. We demonstrate that this methodology leads to\nsubstantial improvements in overall classification accuracy when using Linear\nDiscriminant Analysis (LDA) to map crop types in Occitanie, France and in\nWestern Province, Kenya. When using LDA as our base classifier, we found that\nin France our methodology led to percent reductions in misclassifications\nranging from 2.8% to 42.2% (mean = 21.9%) over eleven different training\ndepartments, and in Kenya the percent reductions in misclassification were\n6.6%, 28.4%, and 42.7% for three training regions. While our methodology was\nstatistically motivated by the LDA classifier, it can be applied to any type of\nclassifier. As an example, we demonstrate its successful application to improve\na Random Forest classifier.",

    "abstract": "The scarcity of high quality medical image annotations hinders the\nimplementation of accurate clinical applications for detecting and segmenting\nabnormal lesions. To mitigate this issue, the scientific community is working\non the development of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) systems that learn\nfrom a training set containing only normal (i.e., healthy) images, where\nabnormal samples (i.e., unhealthy) are detected and segmented based on how much\nthey deviate from the learned distribution of normal samples. One significant\nchallenge faced by UAD methods is how to learn effective low-dimensional image\nrepresentations that are sensitive enough to detect and segment abnormal\nlesions of varying size, appearance and shape. To address this challenge, we\npropose a novel self-supervised UAD pre-training algorithm, named Multi-centred\nStrong Augmentation via Contrastive Learning (MSACL). MSACL learns\nrepresentations by separating several types of strong and weak augmentations of\nnormal image samples, where the weak augmentations represent normal images and\nstrong augmentations denote synthetic abnormal images. To produce such strong\naugmentations, we introduce MedMix, a novel data augmentation strategy that\ncreates new training images with realistic looking lesions (i.e., anomalies) in\nnormal images. The pre-trained representations from MSACL are generic and can\nbe used to improve the efficacy of different types of off-the-shelf\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) UAD models. Comprehensive experimental results show\nthat the use of MSACL largely improves these SOTA UAD models on four medical\nimaging datasets from diverse organs, namely colonoscopy, fundus screening and\ncovid-19 chest-ray datasets.",

    "title": "MitoDet: Simple and robust mitosis detection",
    "abstract": "Mitotic figure detection is a challenging task in digital pathology that has\na direct impact on therapeutic decisions. While automated methods often achieve\nacceptable results under laboratory conditions, they frequently fail in the\nclinical deployment phase. This problem can be mainly attributed to a\nphenomenon called domain shift. An important source of a domain shift is\nintroduced by different microscopes and their camera systems, which noticeably\nchange the color representation of digitized images. In this method description\nwe present our submitted algorithm for the Mitosis Domain Generalization\nChallenge, which employs a RetinaNet trained with strong data augmentation and\nachieves an F1 score of 0.7138 on the preliminary test set.",

    "title": "Studying the Effects of Self-Attention for Medical Image Analysis",
    "abstract": "When the trained physician interprets medical images, they understand the\nclinical importance of visual features. By applying cognitive attention, they\napply greater focus onto clinically relevant regions while disregarding\nunnecessary features. The use of computer vision to automate the classification\nof medical images is widely studied. However, the standard convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) does not necessarily employ subconscious feature relevancy\nevaluation techniques similar to the trained medical specialist and evaluates\nfeatures more generally. Self-attention mechanisms enable CNNs to focus more on\nsemantically important regions or aggregated relevant context with long-range\ndependencies. By using attention, medical image analysis systems can\npotentially become more robust by focusing on more important clinical feature\nregions. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of various\nstate-of-the-art self-attention mechanisms across multiple medical image\nanalysis tasks. Through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations along\nwith a clinical user-centric survey study, we aim to provide a deeper\nunderstanding of the effects of self-attention in medical computer vision\ntasks.",

Our approach is based on the\nexisting type theory Catt, whose models are known to correspond to weak\n$\\infty$-categories. We add a definitional equality relation to this theory\nwhich identifies terms with the same associativity structure, yielding a new\ntype theory Catt$_{sa}$, for strictly associative $\\infty$-categories. We also\nprovide a reduction relation which generates definitional equality, and show it\nis confluent and terminating, giving an algorithm for deciding equality of\nterms, and making typechecking decidable.\nOur key contribution, on which our reduction is based, is an operation on\nterms which we call insertion. This has a direct geometrical interpretation,\nallowing a subterm to be inserted into the head of the term, flatting its\nsyntactic structure. We describe this operation combinatorially in terms of\npasting diagrams, and also show can be characterized as a pushout of contexts.\nThis allows reasoning about insertion using just its universal property.",

Our approach is based on $\\beta$-variational autoencoders\n($\\beta$-VAEs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which allow us to\nextract non-linear modes from multi-scale turbulent flows while encouraging the\nlearning of independent latent variables and penalizing the size of the latent\nvector. Moreover, we introduce an algorithm for ordering VAE-based modes with\nrespect to their contribution to the reconstruction. We apply this method for\nnon-linear mode decomposition of the turbulent flow through a simplified urban\nenvironment, where the flow-field data is obtained based on well-resolved\nlarge-eddy simulations (LESs). We demonstrate that by constraining the shape of\nthe latent space, it is possible to motivate the orthogonality and extract a\nset of parsimonious modes sufficient for high-quality reconstruction. Our\nresults show the excellent performance of the method in the reconstruction\nagainst linear-theory-based decompositions. Moreover, we compare our method\nwith available AE-based models. We show the ability of our approach in the\nextraction of near-orthogonal modes that may lead to interpretability.",

    "title": "Phone Duration Modeling for Speaker Age Estimation in Children",
    "abstract": "Automatic inference of important paralinguistic information such as age from\nspeech is an important area of research with numerous spoken language\ntechnology based applications. Speaker age estimation has applications in\nenabling personalization and age-appropriate curation of information and\ncontent. However, research in speaker age estimation in children is especially\nchallenging due to paucity of relevant speech data representing the\ndevelopmental spectrum, and the high signal variability especially intra age\nvariability that complicates modeling. Most approaches in children speaker age\nestimation adopt methods directly from research on adult speech processing. In\nthis paper, we propose features specific to children and focus on speaker's\nphone duration as an important biomarker of children's age. We propose phone\nduration modeling for predicting age from child's speech. To enable that,\nchildren speech is first forced aligned with the corresponding transcription to\nderive phone duration distributions. Statistical functionals are computed from\nphone duration distributions for each phoneme which are in turn used to train\nregression models to predict speaker age. Two children speech datasets are\nemployed to demonstrate the robustness of phone duration features. We perform\nage regression experiments on age categories ranging from children studying in\nkindergarten to grade 10. Experimental results suggest phone durations contain\nimportant development-related information of children. Phonemes contributing\nmost to estimation of children speaker age are analyzed and presented.",

Furthermore, we\npropose a Grouped Attention Module as the key component of the network. The\nproposed module separates the input feature into several groups along the\nfrequency axis, which makes it capable of capturing long-range dependencies\nfrom different frequency positions on the spectrogram.

We propose a boundary\ncondition that with overwhelming probability is (near) optimal with respect to\nscaling in terms of $\\ell$ and $L$, in the setting where the medium is a sample\nfrom a stationary ensemble with a finite range of dependence (set to be unity\nand with the assumption that $\\ell \\gg 1$). The boundary condition is motivated\nby quantitative stochastic homogenization that allows for a multipole expansion\n[BGO20].\nThis work extends [LO21] from two to three dimensions, and thus we need to\ntake quadrupoles, next to dipoles, into account. This in turn relies on\nstochastic estimates of second-order, next to first-order, correctors. These\nestimates are provided for finite range ensembles under consideration, based on\nan extension of the semi-group approach of [GO15].",
